        "title": "Sony scraps 10bn merger with Zee Entertainment, setting stage for legal row",
        "date": "January 23, 2024 01:12 pm",
        "content": "Japans Sony Group scrapped plans on Monday for a 10 billion (roughly Rs. 83,098 crore) merger of its Indian unit with Zee Entertainment, ending a deal that could have created one of the South Asian nations biggest TV broadcasters. The collapse of the deal in content-hungry India creates more uncertainty for TV broadcaster Zee in particular as competition heats up, with Disney also seeking to merge its Indian businesses with the media assets of billionaire Mukesh Ambanis Reliance. Zee told Indian stock exchanges Sony was seeking 90 million (roughly Rs. 747 crore) in termination fees for alleged breaches of their merger agreement and emergency interim relief by invoking arbitration. Zee said it denies all claims made by Sony and would take appropriate legal action. Sony said in a statement certain closing conditions to the merger were not satisfied despite good faith discussions with Zee, and the companies had been unable to agree upon an extension by their January 21 deadline. After more than two years of negotiations, we are extremely disappointed ... We remain committed to growing our presence in this vibrant and fast-growing market, it added. While neither Sony nor Zee elaborated on Monday on which conditions had been unfulfilled, a stalemate over who will lead the combined company had put the merger in danger. Zee had proposed that CEO Punit Goenka take the helm, but Sony balked after he became the subject of an investigation by Indias market regulator. Zee said on Monday Goenka had been agreeable to step down in the interest of the merger. A source with direct knowledge however said Sony was not keen to proceed unless Goenka backed out before the closure of the merger, rather than after the deal had been sealed as he had proposed. A sign from the lord Last year, the Securities and Exchange Board of India barred Goenka from holding directorships at any listed company, accusing him of being involved in diverting Zees funds to the groups other listed entities. Goenka denied the allegations. An Indian tribunal lifted the ban on him in October but said he would have to cooperate with any investigation by the regulator. The executive, who was in Indias Ayodhya city to attend the grand opening of a Lord Ram temple, wrote on X that he sees the collapse of the Sony deal as a sign from the Lord, adding he would move forward by strengthening his company for stakeholders. Zee is currently contending with declines in advertising revenue and cash reserves. Its cash reserves fell to Rs. 2.48 billion in the six months ended September 30 from Rs. 5.88 billion a year earlier. The Indian company said it had undertaken several steps for the Sony deal resulting in one-time and recurring costs, but will now continue to evaluate organic and inorganic opportunities for growth. With channels in segments like news and entertainment in Hindi and other languages, Zee has for years been a household name in India. It was set up in 1992 by Subhash Chandra, Goenkas father, who is often dubbed the Father of Indian Television. Sony, which too has entertainment channels in India and a streaming service, together with Zee would have had a portfolio of 90 plus channels. The failure of the Zee-Sony merger will be disappointing for shareholders  this merger had the potential to materially change industry dynamics, said Hetal Dalal, president and chief operating officer of Institutional Investor Advisory Services. Sony said it did not expect any material impact from the termination to its estimates for the year ending in March, as it had not factored the deal into its outlook. Zee shares are down about 8 percent from their levels before the merger was first announced in September 2021. Source  Reuters - Agencies",

        "date": "January 23, 2024 03:42 pm",
        "content": "Former captain of Sri Lankas Test and ODI teams, Dimuth Karunaratne has secured a spot in the ICC Mens Test Team of the Year 2023 despite playing just six matches in the year. Meanwhile, the ICC World Test Championship 2021-23 finalists Australia and India have dominated the ICC Mens Test Team of the Year 2023. Dimuth Karunaratne (Sri Lanka) Despite playing just six matches in the year, Sri Lanka captain Dimuth Karunaratne secures a spot in the team with memorable outings throughout 2023 in Tests having amassed 608 runs at an average of 60.8. Karunaratne led by example in the away series in New Zealand with three fifties in four innings, amassing 207 runs, the most by a Sri Lankan batter on the tour. The skipper scored a century in each match against Ireland as Sri Lanka completed a dominant 2-0 whitewash, winning both matches by an innings. Karunaratnes struggles against Pakistan underscored his crucial role within the team as Sri Lanka lost 2-0 at home. Usman Khawaja (Australia) Usman Khawajas purple patch since his dream comeback in January 2022 has shown no signs of slowing down and he finds himself in the ICC Mens Test Team of the Year for the second year running, while also being nominated for the Test Cricketer of the Year. The Aussie opener was the only batter in 2023 to score more than 1000 runs in Tests, aggregating 1210 runs in 13 matches at an average of 52.60, which included six centuries and six fifties. Khawaja kicked off the year with a career-best innings, scoring an unbeaten 195 against South Africa in Sydney. He continued his impressive form by concluding as the highest run-scorer (333 runs) in the Border-Gavaskar series in India. After a forgettable showing in the WTC23 Final  where Australia emerged victorious  Khawaja bounced back in the Ashes with a century and finished the year on a high with five scores of 40 in the six innings. Kane Williamson (New Zealand) It was a sedate start to the year for Kane Williamson in Tests. Yet, for a player of his calibre, it took little time for him to return to form and back among the runs, finishing 2023 with four centuries and 695 runs. Williamson was the architect of New Zealands memorable win against England in Wellington. After being asked to follow on, Williamsons 132 brought the hosts back into the contest as New Zealand went on to win the game by one run. Continuing his stellar form, the 33-year-old guided the Kiwis to victory in a thriller with an unbeaten 121 against Sri Lanka, winning the match of the last ball. Williamson made it three centuries in a row with a double hundred in the second Test as New Zealand completed a 2-0 whitewash. Williamson didnt miss a beat after a serious knee injury, making a triumphant return to Test cricket with a century in the challenging conditions in Bangladesh, albeit in a losing cause. Joe Root (England) Joe Root secures a position in the ICC Mens Test Team of the Year for the fourth time in his career and is also in contention for the Test Player of the Year Award. Root commenced the year on an impressive note with three scores of 50 against New Zealand, which included 153 and 95 in the aforementioned thriller in Wellington. Following a fifty against Ireland in the one-off Test, Root was one of the few bright spots for England in the Ashes. He began the series with aplomb, scoring an unbeaten 118 in a thriller in Birmingham where England ended on the losing side. Despite a brief dip in the next two games, Root played a crucial role with a half-century in the remaining two Tests, helping England draw the series. Travis Head (Australia) The third contender for ICC Mens Test Cricketer of the Year on the list, Travis Head had a memorable 2023 across all formats. In Tests, Heads performance was exceptional, with only two players surpassing his run tally of 919 in 12 matches throughout the year. The year began with a half-century against South Africa at home. However, it was his remarkable showing in the Border-Gavaskar series in India that garnered praise for navigating challenging conditions. Heads standout moment came on the grand stage during the World Test Championship Final at The Oval, where he rescued Australia from a precarious situation with a counter-attacking 163 in the first innings that blew India away. Continuing his fine form in the subsequent Ashes series, Head contributed with half-centuries in each of the first three matches and played crucial innings to assist Australia in retaining the urn. Ravindra Jadeja (India) Lending balance to the ICC Test Team of the Year with his brilliant left-arm spin and handy batting is Ravindra Jadeja. Jadeja kicked off the year in spectacular fashion, delivering a standout performance against Australia in Nagpur with a five-wicket haul and a half-century. He followed up with an even more impressive showing in the next game, securing a 10-wicket match haul, including a seven-for in the second innings, instrumental in India retaining the trophy. Continuing his fine form, he claimed five more wickets in the series and carried the momentum into the World Test Championship Final against Australia, where he contributed with four wickets and a valuable 48 with the bat, despite India ultimately facing defeat. Jadeja began the new iteration of the World Test Championship in the same vein, scalping seven wickets and scoring a fifty against West Indies in the two-match series away from home. Alex Carey (wk) (Australia) No wicket-keeper had more dismissals than Alex Carey in 2023. With 54 dismissals (44 catches and 10 stumpings) in 12 matches, Carey was head and shoulders above the rest, with the next keeper on the list  West Indies Joshua Da Silva  registering only 31 dismissals. While Carey had a forgettable start with the bat earlier in the year, he demonstrated his mettle when it mattered most  during the World Test Championship Final against India. He gave some much-needed impetus in both innings, scoring 44 off 68 in the first and an unbeaten 66 in the second that took the game away from India. He followed it up with another fifty against England in the first Ashes Test and finished the year on a high with a fifty against Pakistan. Pat Cummins (c) (Australia) Anything that Pat Cummins touched turned into gold in 2023. As a result, he finds himself captaining the ICC Mens Test Team of the Year to go with the nomination for the Sir Garfield Sobers Trophy for ICC Mens Cricketer of the Year. His impressive achievements as captain included leading Australia to victory in the World Test Championship and successfully retaining the Ashes in the same year. Cummins was also unstoppable with the ball, topping the wicket-takers charts for pacers with 42 wickets in 11 matches. Cummins bagged four wickets in the New Year Test against South Africa. Despite facing challenges in India, where he secured only four wickets in two Border-Gavaskar Tests, he made a resounding comeback in the final, claiming a crucial four-wicket haul in the second innings. The confidence of the win carried over to the Ashes, where Cummins bagged a brilliant six-for in Leeds while leading Australia to the urn. Cummins capped off the brilliant year with a five-wicket haul in each innings in the Boxing Day Test against Pakistan. Ravichandran Ashwin (India) Ravichandran Ashwin is the fourth nominee for ICC Mens Test Cricketer of the Year to be a part of the Test team of the year. Ashwin was the leading wicket-taker for India in the Border-Gavaskar series, finishing with 25 wickets in four matches. In the very first Test, Ashwin bagged a five-for in the second innings to go with handy contributions with the bat in each innings. His all-round showing fetched him the Player of the Series. Despite the stellar showing, Ashwin did not find a place in Indias XI for the WTC23 Final against the same opponent but made a mark on his comeback into the Test team with 12 wickets (560 and 771) in the first game against West Indies followed by fifty and three wickets in the next game. Mitchell Starc (Australia) Adding left-arm variety to the pace attack of the Team of the Year is Mitchell Starc, who secured an impressive 38 wickets in nine matches during 2023. Starc had a relatively quieter performance in the Border-Gavaskar series, claiming only two wickets in two games but was a thorn in the side of India in the WTC23 Final both with the bat and ball. The left-arm pacer took four wickets and also scored a crucial 41 in the second innings in Australias win in the finale. Starc consistently made significant contributions in the Ashes, which included a five-for in Leeds and a four-wicket haul in each innings at the Oval. He led the charts in the series with 25 wickets in total and took home the Player of the Series. The year concluded on a high note for Starc as he secured nine wickets in two Tests against Pakistan. Stuart Broad (England) In his final year as a cricketer, Stuart Broad demonstrated that he was still at his lethal best, earning a well-deserved place in the Test Team of the Year. Broad commenced 2023 impressively with a four-wicket haul in each match against New Zealand, finishing as the joint-highest wicket-taker (10) for England alongside long-time bowling partner James Anderson. After a five-for against Ireland, Broad showcased his prowess against Australia yet again and was the highest-wicket taker for England (22 wickets) The conclusion of Broads career was nothing short of a fairytale, as he played a pivotal role in Englands thrilling series draw against Australia. He capped off by picking up the final wicket, securing the win for England in a closely contested match and providing a fitting end to his remarkable cricketing career. --ICC--",

        "title": "US and UK launch new round of strikes against Houthi sites in Yemen",
        "date": "January 23, 2024 04:10 pm",
        "content": "According to officials, the U.S. and U.K. used warship- and submarine-launched Tomahawk missiles and fighter jets to take out Houthi missile storage sites, drones and launchers. The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss a military operation, said Australia, Bahrain, Canada and the Netherlands contributed to the mission, including with intelligence and surveillance. In a joint statement, the six allied nations said the strikes specifically targeted a Houthi underground storage site and locations associated with the Houthis missile and air surveillance capabilities. They added, Our aim remains to de-escalate tensions and restore stability in the Red Sea, but let us reiterate our warning to Houthi leadership: we will not hesitate to defend lives and the free flow of commerce in one of the worlds most critical waterways in the face of continued threats. Britains Ministry of Defense confirmed that four Royal Air Force Typhoon jets struck multiple targets at two military sites in the vicinity of Sanaa airfield with precision-guided bombs. The strikes, said Defense Secretary Grant Shapps, were aimed at degrading Houthi capabilities and would deal another blow to their limited stockpiles and ability to threaten global trade. One senior U.S. military official told reporters the strikes dropped between 25 and 30 munitions and hit multiple targets in each location, adding that the U.S. observed good impacts and effects at all sites, including the destruction of more advanced weapons in the underground storage facility. The official said this is the first time such advanced weapons were targeted. The official also said fighter jets from the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower aircraft carrier conducted strikes, and other ships involved included the USS Gravely and USS Mason, both naval destroyers, and the USS Philippine Sea, a cruiser. The joint operation comes about 10 days after U.S. and British warships and fighter jets struck more than 60 targets in 28 locations. That was the first U.S. military response to what has been a persistent campaign of Houthi drone and missile attacks on commercial ships since the start of the Israel-Hamas war in October. The Houthis media office said in an online statement Monday that raids targeted Sanaa, Yemens capital. And Jamal Hassan, a resident from south Sanaa, told The Associated Press that two strikes landed near his home, setting off car alarms in the street. An Associated Press journalist in Sanaa also heard aircraft flying above the skies of Sanaa overnight Monday. Al-Masirah, a Houthi-run satellite news channel, said there were raids on three areas of Sanaa: al-Dailami Air Base just north of the capital, Sarif, northeast of the city center, and al-Hafa, which is south of Sanaa. British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak spoke with President Joe Biden earlier Monday. Sunaks office said the two leaders agreed to take as needed, targeted military action to degrade Houthi capabilities. Multiple US strikes The latest barrage of allied attacks marks the eighth time the U.S. has conducted strikes on Houthi sites since Jan. 12. And it follows an almost-daily assault on Houthi missile launchers by U.S. fighter jets and ship-based Tomahawks over the past week. The rapid response missions, which officials said go after launchers that are armed and ready to fire, demonstrate the militarys increasing ability to watch, detect and strike militant activities in Yemen. The chaotic wave of attacks and reprisals involving the United States, its allies and foes suggests that the retaliatory strikes havent deterred the Houthis from their campaign against Red Sea shipping, and that the broader regional war that the U.S. has spent months trying to avoid is becoming closer to reality. For months, the Houthis have attacked ships in the regions waterways that they say are either linked to Israel or heading to Israeli ports. They say their attacks aim to end the Israeli air-and-ground offensive in the Gaza Strip that was triggered by the Palestinian militant group Hamas Oct. 7 attack in southern Israel. But any such links to the ships targeted in the rebel assaults have grown more tenuous as the attacks continue. The U.S. and allies warned of retaliation for weeks, and the White House and a host of partner nations issued a final warning on Jan. 3 to the Houthis to cease the attacks or face potential military action. That threat, however, had little noticeable effect. The Houthis continued to attack ships in the region, including at times appearing to target U.S. Navy and U.S.-owned ships, in addition to the wide range of commercial vessels. Of the eight strike missions on Yemen this month, all but the two with Britain were conducted by the U.S. military alone. Five of the latest strikes were labeled self-defense to take out missiles ready to fire. The most recent, on Saturday, struck and destroyed a Houthi anti-ship missile that was aimed into the Gulf of Aden and was prepared to launch, according to Central Command. The Biden administration has also put the Houthis back on its list of specially designated global terrorists. The sanctions that come with the formal designation are meant to sever violent extremist groups from their sources of financing, while also allowing vital humanitarian aid to continue flowing to impoverished Yemenis. U.S. defense officials have said they believe the strikes have degraded the Houthis weapons and strike capabilities. But Biden and others have acknowledged that the rebels are well-equipped by Iran and are likely to continue the attacks. The Houthis, meanwhile, have made it clear that they have no intention of scaling back their assault. In the wake of the first U.S. and British joint attack, Hussein al-Ezzi, a Houthi official in their Foreign Ministry, said, America and Britain will undoubtedly have to prepare to pay a heavy price and bear all the dire consequences of this blatant aggression. The continued harassment of the ships has driven the U.S. and international partners to take extraordinary steps to defend them through a joint mission named Operation Prosperity Guardian, in which they provide a protective umbrella for vessels traveling the critical waterway that runs from the Suez Canal down to the Bab el-Mandeb Strait. About 400 commercial vessels transit the southern Red Sea at any given time. And the ongoing violence has prompted companies to reroute their ships, sending them around Africa through the Cape of Good Hope instead  a much longer and less efficient passage.

        "title": "Oscars nominations 2024: Barbie and Oppenheimer set to dominate",
        "date": "January 23, 2024 04:13 pm",
        "content": "Nominations for the 2024 Oscars will be announced on Tuesday, after a huge year for cinema which saw Barbie and Oppenheimer dominate the box office. Poor Things, The Holdovers and Killers of the Flower Moon are also expected to feature heavily when the nominations are announced from 13:30 GMT. Cillian Murphy, Emma Stone, Robert Downey Jr and DaVine Joy Randolph are all likely to score acting nominations. Jimmy Kimmel will host this years ceremony from Los Angeles on 10 March. The Barbenheimer phenomenon, a viral trend which saw thousands of fans book tickets to see both films on the same day last summer, makes this years Oscars far more accessible than usual. While several Academy Awards ceremonies in recent years have recognised films which had little breakthrough with the general public, producers will be hoping Barbie and Oppenheimers likely inclusion will result in a surge in interest and viewers. Which films are competing for best picture? After a rule change a few years ago intended to widen the field, the best picture category now has a guaranteed 10 slots available. There is general consensus that Oppenheimer, Barbie, Poor Things, Killers of the Flower Moon and The Holdovers will all score nominations. Anatomy of a Fall, Maestro, The Zone of Interest, Past Lives and American Fiction are also seen as hot favourites and very likely to compete for the Academys most prestigious prize. But there are plenty of other contenders which could easily spring nominations in the top category, such as The Color Purple, Society of the Snow, All of Us Strangers and May December. In recent days, there has also been a last-minute campaign - similar to the one that netted Andrea Riseborough a surprise acting nomination last year - for Origin to be recognised at the Oscars, after it missed out at a string of precursor ceremonies. Whos in the acting race? After a slightly weaker field in 2023, this years best actor category is extremely crowded and competitive. The frontrunner is Paul Giamatti for The Holdovers, a film which sees him play a grumpy teacher who must stay in his boarding school over Christmas to supervise the pupils who arent going home for the holidays. Cillian Murphy is also in the race for his portrayal of theoretical physicist J Robert Oppenheimer, while Bradley Cooper could be recognised for his performance as composer Leonard Bernstein in Maestro. Meanwhile, Rustins Colman Domingo is a strong contender for his depiction of civil rights activist Bayard Rustin, and Jeffrey Wright could be recognised for his role as a frustrated author in American Fiction. Other possible but slightly less likely contenders include Killers of the Flower Moon star Leonardo DiCaprio, Saltburns Barry Keoghan, The Iron Claws Zac Efron and Andrew Scott for All of Us Strangers. The best actress category is just as busy. Lily Gladstone will likely be recognised for her role in Killers of the Flower Moon as an Osage woman living in 1920s Oklahoma who must deal with efforts by white settlers to take advantage of their land for oil. Poor Things star Emma Stone will almost certainly be nominated for her performance as an infant whose brain has been transplanted into the body of a grown woman, who then goes on an adventure across the world. Sandra Hüller could be recognised for playing a mother accused of murdering her husband in Anatomy of a Fall, while Maestros Carey Mulligan is likely to be one of the few British nominees for her portrayal of Leonard Bernsteins wife Felicia Montealegre. The Academy may well include Margot Robbie for Barbie, the monster box office hit which she also produced, Past Lives star Greta Lee for her role as a woman who reconnects with her childhood sweetheart, or Nyads Annette Bening for her portrayal of record-breaking swimmer Diana Nyad. Theres also still a chance that The Color Purple star Fantasia Barrino could make it in, as could Priscillas Cailee Spaeny for her portrayal of Priscilla Presley. What about the supporting categories? The Holdovers star DaVine Joy Randolph is the safest bet of all the acting categories - she has dominated at all the precursor ceremonies and is very likely to win best supporting actress at the Oscars. She could be joined in the category by The Color Purple star Danielle Brooks, Oppenheimers Emily Blunt, Nyads Jodie Foster and Ferraris Penélope Cruz. Other possible nominees include Julianne Moore of May December, Saltburns Rosamund Pike and Barbies America Ferrera. The supporting actor race will almost certainly be led by Oppenheimers Robert Downey Jr. But there is competition from Barbies Ryan Gosling, American Fictions Sterling K Brown and May Decembers Charles Melton. Meanwhile, two actors from Poor Things - Mark Ruffalo and Willem Dafoe - could be recognised, and its never a good idea to bet against Robert De Niro, who appeared in Killers of the Flower Moon. What about the directors? Several Oscars stalwarts released films this year and will almost certainly show up in this category - such as Martin Scorsese for Killers of the Flower Moon, and Christopher Nolan for Oppenheimer. There could also be recognition for Greta Gerwig for Barbie, Jonathan Glazer for The Zone of Interest and Yorgos Lanthimos for Poor Things. Otherwise, spots could go to Justine Triet for Anatomy of a Fall, Alexander Payne for The Holdovers, Bradley Cooper for Maestro and potentially even Celine Song for her accomplished directorial debut Past Lives. Two of the last three winners of best director have been women - although last year it was an entirely male set of nominees. Why is best original song so crowded? In a word, Barbie. The films soundtrack was almost as ubiquitous last summer as the movie itself. Three different songs from the film are in contention for the musical prize this year - Billie Eilishs What Was I Made For?, Dua Lipas Dance the Night and Im Just Ken performed by actor Ryan Gosling. However, according to Oscar rules, only two songs from the same film can be nominated - so at least one of the above will miss out. The remaining slots could be taken by the likes of Lenny Kravitzs Road to Freedom from Rustin and It Never Went Away from American Symphony, written by Jon Batiste and Dan Wilson of US rock group Semisonic. But dont bet against competition from songs lifted from the soundtracks of The Color Purple, Flora and Son, Flamin Hot and The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes - the latter could see Olivia Rodrigo nominated for Cant Catch Me Now. How to watch the Oscar nominations You can watch the Oscar nominations being announced live on the Academys official website and YouTube account - and streamed in the UK on ITVX. The nominations for all categories will be read out by actors Zazie Beetz and Jack Quaid from 13:30 GMT. The ceremony will take place on 10 March and be broadcast in the UK on ITV.

        "date": "January 23, 2024 04:57 pm",
        "content": "The Supreme Court on Tuesday (23 Jan.) concluded the hearing of the petition filed by Ministers Manusha Nanayakkara and Harin Fernando, challenging the decision taken by Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) to oust them from the party and disqualify them of their parliamentary seats. The hearing was concluded by a three-judge bench of the Supreme Court comprising of Justices Vijith Malalgoda, Achala Wengappuli and Arjuna Obeysekera, when the case was taken up in court this morning, and it was declared that the verdict would be deferred, indefinitely. Appearing on behalf of Minister Nanayakkara during the hearing, Presidents Counsel Faizer Mustapha informed the court that as per the constitution of the SJB, taking disciplinary action against its members is a responsibility entitled to the partys Working Committee, and not one that has been devolved to the party leader. Thus, he highlighted that the decision taken by SJB leader Sajith Premadasa to oust Nanyakkara was unconstitutional, as per the partys rules, and thereby unlawful. On 18 July 2023, the SJB Working Committee had decided to expel Fernando and Nanayakkara from the party. In May 2022, the SJB had suspended the party membership of the two parliamentarians after they had accepted ministerial portfolios in the government while the party had vowed to take disciplinary action against them. MPs Harin Fernando and Manusha Nanayakkara were sworn in as the Minister of Tourism  Lands and Minister of Labour  Foreign Employment, respectively. Fernando and Nanayakkara had said they accepted ministerial portfolios in the government under President Gotabaya Rajapaksa to do their utmost to find solutions to the ongoing economic crisis as a positive response was not received from many political party leaders for a collective effort. They both subsequently resigned from their ministerial portfolios on July 9, 2022 along with the rest of the Cabinet, after then President Gotabaya Rajapaksa informed the Speaker of Parliament that he intends to resign. However, they were both reappointed to the same ministerial portfolios by incumbent President Ranil Wickremesinghe when he appointed a new Cabinet on July 22, 2022.",

        "date": "January 23, 2024 05:09 pm",
        "content": "Sri Lankan all-rounder and Womens Team Captain Chamari Athapaththu, who showcased exceptional skills as a player in the ODI format throughout the year, has been named as the captain of the ICC Womens ODI Team of the Year for 2023. Meanwhile, on Monday (Jan 22), Athapaththu was also honoured with the team captaincy of the ICC Womens T20I Team of the Year for 2023. The ICC Womens ODI Team of the Year for 2023 is as follows: Chamari Athapaththu (Sri Lanka) Chamari Athapaththu showcased exceptional skills as a player in the ODI format throughout the year. Her standout moment came in the series decider against New Zealand, where she played a stunning unbeaten 140 off just 80 balls, leading her team to a historic victory after a shaky start in the chase. She also led Sri Lanka to a 1-0 series win over Bangladesh in a rain-truncated decider, where she contributed with both bat and ball. Her finest performances, though, came against New Zealand, where she guided Sri Lanka to their first-ever bilateral series win with two fiery centuries. Athapaththus sublime form throughout the year saw her rack up 415 runs in just eight ODIs, averaging 69.16 and notably scoring at a rate of over 125. She walks into the Womens ODI Team of the Year as one of the two openers. Phoebe Litchfield (Australia) With 485 runs in the year in ODIs, 20-year-old Phoebe Litchfield announced herself to international cricket in spectacular fashion. She was the second-highest run-getter in the year in womens ODIs, averaging 53.8 with the bat with a century and four fifties. In an Australian side filled with superstars, Litchfield carved out a place of her own with an impressive first year. She began her ODI career with back-to-back half-centuries, but reserved her best for late in the year, where on her maiden tour of India, she stood apart from the rest. Litchfield made 78 and 63 in the first two games of the series and walked away with the Player of the Series award. She also made her maiden ODI ton in the year against Ireland. In four of the 14 ODIs she played in the year, the young sensation was awarded the Player of the Match award. Ellyse Perry (Australia) Although Ellyse Perry could not add to her career ODI century count in 2023, she enjoyed a stellar year, knocking off five fifties in the 10 innings she batted. Perry was Australias highest run-scorer in the Womens Ashes in England, making 185 runs in three ODI innings, including two fifties and another score in the forties. The senior Australian player once again played a big role in the series in India, reeling off half-centuries in the first two games as Australia took an unassailable lead in the three-match series. Amelia Kerr (New Zealand) The top-scorer in the year in womens ODIs, Amelia Kerr was one of the contenders for the ICC Womens ODI Cricketer of the Year 2023. The White Ferns all-rounder made 541 runs during the year, averaging 67.62 with two hundreds and three fifties. She also contributed with the ball, taking eight wickets with her leg-breaks. Kerr shone as one of the few highlights for New Zealand during their June-July series against Sri Lanka, despite the teams 2-1 defeat. She starred in the White Ferns only win of the series with a century and a wicket. Kerr earned the Player of the Series award in New Zealands last ODI series of the year against Pakistan, showcasing her skills with two half-centuries and contributing with five wickets in the three-match contest. Beth Mooney (wk) (Australia) Beth Mooney was yet again outstanding in the middle-order in ODIs, making 439 runs at an average over 60. The left-hander began the year with a Player of the Series performance against Pakistan, making scores of 57 and 133. She carried the form to the Womens Ashes, where in the first ODI, she made an unbeaten 81 despite her partners struggling a touch. Mooney also stood as wicketkeeper in four ODIs in the year and will be the wicketkeeper for this ICC Womens ODI Team of the Year 2023. Nat Sciver-Brunt (England) Nat Sciver-Brunt played only six ODIs in the year, but such was the impression that she made that she forced her way into the Womens ODI Player of the Year shortlist and the best XI of the year. With three centuries in the six games, Nat Sciver-Brunt was in outrageous form, and carried England to a famous ODI series win against the Aussies, their first over them since 2013. She starred with a Player of the Series award in the Womens Ashes ODI series, smashing two hundreds while also picking up three wickets. Her strong performances won her the Player of the Series award. She further made another hundred, smashing a 74-ball 120 against Sri Lanka as England won the series 2-0. Ash Gardner (Australia) With 24 wickets in 13 ODIs, Ash Gardner was the leading wicket-taker in womens ODIs in 2023. While not contributing heavily with the bat during the year, her best came against England in Southampton in an ODI where her all-round showing stood out. Gardner made a fighting 33 off 37 balls coming in to bat in a precarious situation and then went on to three important wickets, including that of Sciver-Brunt and Amy Jones, to turn the game in Australias favour. Despite not scoring big runs, Gardner made her runs at a rate of nearly 120 with the bat in 2023, highlighting her utility as an all-rounder. Annabel Sutherland (Australia) Tough lower-order runs and some crucial wickets with the ball saw Annabel Sutherland catapult herself into the Womens ODI Team of the Year. While her 47-ball 50 from No.7 in Southampton was crucial to Australia winning by three runs, her most impressive knock in the year came as opener. Opening the batting for the first time in her ODI career against Ireland, Sutherland hit a century, her maiden one in ODIs. With the ball, she took 13 wickets in as many games, bowling at an economy rate under five runs per over. Her best came in Melbourne at the start of the year against the Windies, when she took 3-6 in five overs in a rain-affected match. Notably, she also took 10 catches as an outfielder. Nadine de Klerk (South Africa) Nadine de Klerk stood out as South Africas star bowler, filling in the gaping hole left by Shabnim Ismails retirement. De Klerk took 16 wickets in nine ODIs in the year, averaging 16.68 with the ball. The South Africans most impressive performance came against Pakistan in Karachi, where she snared a four-wicket haul. But de Klerk was consistent in the year, taking three-plus wickets in four ODIs she played in 2023. She also played a more than handy role with the bat, making 181 runs at an average of 45.25 with two fifties. She won the Player of the Series in Pakistan for her significant all-round contributions as South Africa won the series 2-1. Lea Tahuhu (New Zealand) Lea Tahuhu played only nine ODIs in 2023, but shone with 15 wickets at an impressive average of 20.86. The experienced White Ferns pacer also moved into the top 10 of the ICC Womens ODI Player Rankings during the year. Her best performance came in Galle in the second ODI of the series against Sri Lanka, where she took 431 to bowl Sri Lanka out for 213. Nahida Akter (Bangladesh) The Bangladesh spinner took 20 wickets in the year in ODIs, the second-highest for anyone in womens ODIs in 2023. She shone with seven wickets in Bangladeshs series victory over Pakistan at home. Notably, in the second ODI of the series, the game ended in a tie and Nahida was charged with the responsibility of bowling in the Super Over. She took two wickets in five balls to end Pakistans Super Over, conceding only seven runs, which Bangladesh surpassed to come back into the series after a loss in the first game. In the third ODI in Mirpur, Nahida starred again with a three-wicket haul to help Bangladesh seal a series win. She also had a good home series against India, taking six wickets at an average of 15. --ICC--",

        "content": "The Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) has decided to call off the planned indefinite strike action which was slated to commence from tomorrow (Jan. 24). This decision has been reached after the Director General of Health Services, issuing a written notification to the Directors and Heads of all Health Institutions, a short while ago, canceling with immediate effect the previously issued letter announcing that the payment of the Disturbance, Availability and Transport (DAT) allowance of doctors for the month of January will be temporarily suspended. Furthermore, the heads of the institutions have been ordered to pay the relevant allowance through a special voucher to the doctors for the month of January, for those who do not receive the DAT allowance through the regular payroll. Accordingly, the executive committee of the GMOA announced that the previously planned island-wide strike action would be cancelled with immediate effect. However, the GMOA also expressed their gratitude to the relevant authorities led by President Ranil Wickremesinghe, who intervened in order to defeat the arbitrary behaviour of some of the officials of the Ministry of Finance in order to do justice to the doctors. Earlier today (23), the Director General of Health Services Dr. Asela Gunawardena had informed that the payment of the DAT allowance for doctors, which was recently increased by Rs. 35,000, was temporarily suspended due to insufficient funds. In a letter to all directors of government hospitals and heads of institutions, the Director General of Health Services states that although the necessary arrangements have been made for the payment of the said allowance, the Treasury has not provided funds within the approved allocation limit. On January 08, the Cabinet of Ministers gave its approval to President Ranil Wickremesinghes proposal to double the DAT allowance paid to government doctors, raising it from Rs. 35,000 to Rs. 70,000. Since then, the health sector employees trade unions representing a wide range of health sector professionals, including radiology and laboratory technicians, pharmacists and drug compounders, midwives, Public Health Inspectors, and entomology officers launched strikes on multiple occasions in protest of the governments decision and demanding an allowance increase for all health sector employees.",

        "date": "January 23, 2024 06:34 pm",
        "content": "Sagala Ratnayaka, the Presidents Senior Adviser on National Security and Chief of the Presidential Staff, emphasized today (23 Jan.) at the Presidential Secretariat that President Ranil Wickremesinghes effective economic initiatives have fostered trust in the Sri Lankan economy on the global stage. He highlighted the Presidents commitment to a new economic vision aimed at stabilizing the countrys economy through comprehensive reforms in the financial, legal and governance sectors. Speaking at the Budget 2024 conference, organized by the Presidents Trade Union Relations Division, Ratnayaka outlined the plans to position Sri Lanka as a hub for energy exports. This strategic move aligns with the Presidents broader efforts to enhance the nations economic standing and international reputation. Expressing his views further Sagala Ratnayaka said: When President Ranil Wickremesinghe assumed office, the country faced a severe economic crisis marked by long queues for oil and gas, as well as prolonged power cuts. The crisis was exacerbated by a tax policy that led to a decline in government revenue, an ineffective agricultural policy, and a decrease in tax filings. Additionally, the economic downturn was heightened by a drop in tourist arrivals due to the Covid epidemic, resulting in a loss of foreign exchange. In response to these challenges, the current president took charge amidst this economic turmoil. Strategic changes were made to the agricultural policy, leading to increased rice production and alleviating food shortages. Collaborating with the International Monetary Fund, a new program was devised to stabilize Sri Lankas economy, encompassing crucial financial, legal, and governance reforms. Despite the imposition of new taxes, which brought some pressure on the citizens, the governments efforts have led to a rapid stabilization of the countrys economy. As a result, international confidence in Sri Lanka has grown, and the nation is witnessing a strengthening economic trajectory. Furthermore, there are new proposals for reform aimed at boosting the tourism industry, contributing to a surplus in the balance of payments under this economic program. Notably, foreign reserves, which stood at 2.1 billion dollars in 2022, have seen a significant increase to 4.5 billion dollars today. The government has successfully curtailed inflation from 77 in 2022 to a commendable 4 at present. Achieving a state revenue around 16 of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is essential for effective governance. Despite the challenges, the economic reforms implemented in 2023 resulted in a state income of approximately 11 of the GDP. The key to economic stability lies in strengthening government revenue, and plans have been set in motion to systematically increase revenue through institutions like the Inland Revenue Department, Sri Lanka Customs, and the Excise Department. Relief for the entire populace can be anticipated within the next year if this economic program is effectively executed. The 2024 budget outlines development proposals, including the provision of free land for farmers and housing rights for urban residents, with substantial allocations for relief. Additionally, proposals for the modernization of the agriculture and fishing industries have been submitted. Moreover, Sri Lanka holds the potential to generate 80 gigawatts of renewable energy, far exceeding the estimated 15 gigawatts required for total electricity consumption by 2050. Plans are underway to position Sri Lanka as a centre for energy export, including the production of green hydrogen to boost the national economy. Despite challenges, the nation possesses the capability to emerge as an economic force in the international arena. Meanwhile, expressing his views, Governor of the Western Province Marshal of the Air Roshan Gunatillake said; The presentation of a countrys budget serves as the vehicle for implementing national policies. This years budget aligns with various national interests, particularly focusing on the economic reform program propelling Sri Lanka towards becoming an emerging state. It is imperative for government officials to diligently implement this budget to ensure the public receives maximum relief. Unnecessary apprehension about budget proposals should be avoided. Instead, the maturity and experience of public officials should be harnessed for the benefit of the public. Presidents Economic Advisor Dr. R.H.S. Samaratunga: In March 2022, Sri Lanka encountered its most severe economic crisis in history, posing a threat to peoples livelihoods within their own homes. The country had never experienced such a profound economic downturn before. The announcement in 2022 that it was impossible to meet the obligations of existing foreign loans led to a situation where no country was willing to engage in business with Sri Lanka. Consequently, shortages of gas and fuel emerged, plunging the nation into a profound economic crisis. In response to this dire situation, President Ranil Wickremesinghe assumed leadership, engaging in negotiations with the International Monetary Fund and instituting a new financial reform to reshape the economic landscape. His economic program successfully fostered macroeconomic stability, earning the international communitys confidence in Sri Lankas economy. While the International Monetary Fund acknowledges the current governments program, it is recognized that restoring a crippled economy from a severe crisis is a process that takes time and requires a formalized program. The proposed new economic reforms aim to stabilize the economy in the coming years, and the current budget marks the initial step in this direction. Positive economic measures, including fortifying the export economy, implementing anti-corruption initiatives, enhancing security, providing land, and offering housing, have been outlined in this years budget. Given these conditions, it is anticipated that the economic growth rate will reach 2 by the end of this year. The Presidents Director General of Trade Unions Saman Ratnapriya expressing his views said: The 2024 budget was presented by President Ranil Wickremesinghe in his role as the Minister of Finance, serving as the economic blueprint for the current year. Even in challenging circumstances, the realization of the proposed initiatives hinges on meaningful discussions within society regarding this budget. There have been widespread misconceptions, particularly concerning the Value Added Tax (VAT) amendment. Its crucial to note that while VAT is set to increase from 15 to 18, this hike is not uniform across all goods. Some products will experience a 3 increase from their existing VAT, while others will see a jump from 0 to 18. Additionally, due to tax adjustments, certain items may witness a lower percentage increase than the stipulated 18. Engaging in a comprehensive and informed discussion within society is vital to address concerns and provide clarity on the implications of these VAT changes. K. K. I. Eranda, Director of the State Revenue Unit of the Presidents Office: The governments inadequate collection of Value Added Tax (VAT) has been noted, with the potential to contribute 6 of the Gross Domestic Product to the economy if properly collected. Presently, only a 2 contribution is observed. The investigation identifies three primary tax leakages. Firstly, businessmen collect tax but fail to remit it to the government. Secondly, tax losses occur due to irregularities among officials. The third leakage results from tax exemptions. It is imperative to take measures to prevent these leakages, as doing so holds the key to stabilizing the economy. In the first half of 2019, VAT stood at 15, reducing to 8 in 2020 and maintaining the same rate in 2020, 2021, and 2022. Despite the reduction in VAT to 8 in 2020, there was no corresponding decrease in the prices of goods. Likewise, keeping VAT at 15 for the following three years did not stimulate an economic upturn in the midst of the collapse. Consequently, the decision was made to revise VAT to 18. Participants in this event included Director General of the Treasury Kapila C. Senaratne, the Western Provincial Secretary, government officials from the Colombo district, political activists, trade union leaders, and numerous civil society activists, including journalists.",

        "date": "January 23, 2024 07:09 pm",
        "content": "A group of Sri Lankan Tamil legislators has sought Indias intervention to ensure that Colombo fully implements the New Delhi-mooted 13th Amendment, which provides for the devolution of power to the minority community, PTI reported quoting sources. The group led by the veteran politician and TNA Leader R Sampanthan met Indias new High Commissioner to Sri Lanka, Santosh Jha, on Monday, said the source from the Tamil National Alliance (TNA), which represents Sri Lankas Tamil minority. The two-hour-long talks were centred on the 13 Amendment, which created the provincial councils system for the island nations nine provinces. The Tamil parties pointed out the need for Indias intervention in the current Sri Lankan political context for the meaningful devolution of power, the source said. They also highlighted the issue of the Tamil political prisoners and the Tamil land grabbing by the state. India has been pressing Sri Lanka to implement the 13th Amendment brought in after the Indo-Sri Lankan agreement of 1987. The 13A provides for the devolution of power to the Tamil community. The 13A became a part of Sri Lankas constitution in 1987 through the direct intervention of the then-Indian government led by Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi as part of the Indo-Lanka Accord. The current Tamil political parties are sceptical of the political will of the majority Sinhala to fully implement the 13A, the PTI report said. Meanwhile, the Indian High Commission in Colombo reports that the new Indian High Commissioner had met with Tamil leaders of Northern and Eastern Provinces, and discussed the issues concerning political, economic and social development of the region. Reiterating Indias longstanding position on reconciliation and full implementation of the Thirteenth Amendment, High Commissioner reaffirmed Indias continuous commitment to work for the well-being of the people of this region, the High Commission said in a tweet. --With inputs from agencies",

The Minister of State also highlighted that the restoration of 61 tanks has been initiated for the agricultural development of the Mannar and Vavuniya districts. State Minister for Rural Economy, K. Kader Masthan, conveyed this information during his participation in a press conference held at the Presidential Media Centre (PMC) today (23), focusing on the theme Collective path to a stable country. State Minister Kader Masthan further stated: We initially anticipated a prolonged economic recovery period for the country. However, President Ranil Wickremesinghe expedited the stabilization process promptly and swiftly stabilized the economy. The President deserves gratitude for that. Moreover, specific financial allocations have been designated for various projects aimed at enhancing the rural economy in the Northern, Eastern and Central provinces. In the previous year, the Ministry of Rural Economy initiated several programs, including the distribution of goats and essential seeds for green cultivation, contributing to the enhancement of peoples livelihoods. Consequently, we have effectively utilized approximately 98 of the allocated financial funds for the ministrys programs, resulting in tangible benefits for the people. Particularly noteworthy is the remarkable progress in the Mannar district, where this years green bean harvest reached about 1050 metric tons. Significant advancements have also been made in goat management. Additionally, numerous development initiatives have been commenced with the support of foreign aid. A noteworthy project is the restoration of tanks, crucial for the agricultural sectors development. As part of this initiative, 30 tanks in Mannar district and 31 tanks in Vavuniya district are undergoing renovation.

        "date": "January 23, 2024 09:13 pm",
        "content": "An influential trade body which represents Big Tech firms such as Meta, Apple, Amazon, X (formerly Twitter), Google, Snap Inc and others today refuted certain claims made by Sri Lankas Public Security Minister Tiran Alles in his statement in Parliament, concerning the controversial Online Safety Bill. In a statement issued on Tuesday (23 Jan.), the Asia Internet Coalition (AIC) challenged that the Ministers recent claims does not accurately reflect the substantial contributions that the AIC has made throughout the legislative process. They also brought to light the fact that the AIC was not made aware of any amendments to the Online Safety Bill, despite their contributions. However, the AIC emphasized that while their submissions to the Minister on the Online Safety Bill included comprehensive submissions as well as engagements such as hosting representatives from the Ministry of Public Security at the annual Online Safety Forum organised by the AIC in Singapore, they stand by their stance that the relevant Bill, in its current form, is unworkable. We unequivocally stand by our position that the Online Safety Bill, in its current form, is unworkable and would undermine potential growth and foreign direct investment into Sri Lankas digital economy. We firmly believe that for the Bill to align with global best practices, extensive revisions are imperative, the AIC asserted. On 08 January, the AIC had expressed their concerns to Public Security Minister Tiran Alles that the proposed Bill poses significant challenges that, if not addressed comprehensively, could undermine the potential growth of Sri Lankas digital economy. They listed 13 key issues identified within the provisions of the proposed Bill, and urged the Minister have more comprehensive and meaningful consultations in order to address the complexities and nuances associated with the Bill. We remain committed to working with the Government of Sri Lanka to create a more workable and effective Online Safety Bill that aligns with global best practices, the statement read. The Online Safety Bill, published in the government gazette on 18 September 2023, aims to ban online communication of certain statements in the country, prevent the use of online accounts  both authentic and inauthentic  for the use of prohibited purposes, to suppress the financing and other support of communication of false statements and other related matters. However, the Bill has come under fire for some of its problematic aspects, with the AIC, the International Commission of Jurists (ICJ), the Bar Association of Sri Lanka (BASL), and the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka (HRCSL) voicing concerns. The Asia Internet Coalition (AIC) is an industry association comprising leading Internet and technology companies. Co-founded by eBay, Google, Nokia, Skype, and Yahoo! in 2010, the trade association lobbies government agencies to address public policy issues and facilitate the development of the internet economy in the Asia Pacific region. The AICs current membership includes Apple, Facebook, Google, Expedia Group, Amazon, Line, LinkedIn, Rakuten, SAP, Airbnb, Grab, Twitter, Yahoo, Booking.com, and Cloudfare.",

        "date": "January 23, 2024 10:05 pm",
        "content": "Twenty-four Israeli soldiers were killed in Israels worst day of losses in Gaza, the military said on Tuesday, as its forces encircled southern Gazas main city, trapping Palestinian residents trying to flee. Spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said 21 soldiers were killed when two buildings they had mined for demolition exploded after militants fired at a nearby tank. Earlier, three soldiers were reported killed in a separate attack. Israeli tanks, advancing west towards the Mediterranean, shut the road out towards the coast on Tuesday, blocking the escape route for civilians trying to reach Rafah, the last town on Gazas southern edge  now crammed with more than half the enclaves 2.3 million people. At least 195 Palestinians were killed in the space of 24 hours, raising the documented toll to 25,490, according to Palestinian health officials, who say thousands more dead are feared lost in the rubble. The advancing Israelis have blockaded hospitals, which Palestinian officials say makes it impossible to rescue the dead and wounded. At the European Hospital, reached by Reuters in southern Khan Younis, Ahed Masmah brought in five corpses, piled on a mattress on his donkey cart. At Khan Youniss main Nasser hospital, the biggest still functioning in the Gaza Strip, bodies were being buried on the grounds because it was unsafe to go out to the cemetery. Footage filmed by Palestinian journalist Hamdan El-Dahdouh showed persistent gunfire hitting the top of the main building. Another Khan Younis hospital, Al-Khair, was stormed by Israeli troops who arrested staff, according to Palestinian officials. Al-Amal Hospital was unreachable; the Red Crescent which runs it said a tank shell had hit its fourth-floor headquarters there, a civilian had been killed at the entrance and Israelis were firing from drones on anyone who moved nearby, making it impossible to dispatch ambulances.

        "content": "His Eminence Malcolm Cardinal Ranjith has filed a petition challenging the Anti-Terrorism Bill which was presented to the parliament by the government in a bid to replace the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA). In his petition, the Cardinal has requested the Supreme Court to deliver an order stating that several provisions of the Anti-Terrorism Bill are not in line with the Constitution. The Attorney General has been named as the respondent of the petition, which alleges that the proposed legislation, if passed in its current form, would grant unlimited powers to the Tri-Forces, the Police and the Coast Guard to make unwarranted arrests without reasonable suspicion. This is a violation of the fundamental rights including the freedom of expression guaranteed by the Constitution, the Cardinal raised alarm in his petition. Hence, the Cardinal has sought a Supreme Court to issue an order mandating a parliamentary vote with a two-thirds majority and a referendum to pass the Bill, which was tabled in the parliament on January 10. Last week, the president of the Inter-Company Employees Union Wasantha Samarasinghe also put forward a petition against the Anti-Terrorism Bill, seeking a Supreme Court order declaring that certain provisions are unconstitutional. On September 05, 2023, the Cabinet of Ministers granted approval to publish the Anti-Terrorism Bill, which was revised in accordance with the suggestions and opinions received by different parties in the government gazette, and to table the bill in parliament for passing. Although the original draft bill had been published in the government gazette on March 22, 2023, it was later revised and re-drafted in consideration of all the opinions and suggestions received by the Ministry of Justice by various interested parties in this regard both locally and internationally. However, the Bill has sparked controversy both locally and internationally, with rights organizations including the Office of the High Commissioner of Human Rights (OHCHR) urging the government to revise the proposed legislation and to bring it fully in line with Sri Lankas international human rights obligations.",

Meanwhile, he also said that although the salaries of government employees are increased by Rs. 10,000 from this year, that amount is nowhere near enough to cover the expenses considering the price hikes. But the government has given the increment that it can afford this year. The next challenge is to increase the revenue.

        "title": "Trump wins New Hampshire primary as rematch with Biden appears increasingly likely",
        "date": "January 24, 2024 11:12 am",
        "content": "Former President Donald Trump easily won New Hampshires primary on Tuesday, seizing command of the race for the Republican nomination and making a November rematch against President Joe Biden feel all the more inevitable. The result was a setback for former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley, who finished second despite investing significant time and financial resources in a state famous for its independent streak. Shes the last major challenger after Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis ended his presidential bid over the weekend, allowing her to campaign as the sole alternative to Trump. Trumps allies ramped up pressure on Haley to leave the race before the polls had closed, but Haley vowed after the results were announced to continue her campaign. Speaking to supporters, she intensified her criticism of the former president, questioning his mental acuity and pitching herself as a unifying candidate who would usher in generational change. This race is far from over. There are dozens of states left to go, Haley said, while some in the crowd cried, Its not over! Trump, meanwhile, can now boast of being the first Republican presidential candidate to win open races in Iowa and New Hampshire since both states began leading the election calendar in 1976, a striking sign of how rapidly Republicans have rallied around him to make him their nominee for the third consecutive time. At his victory party Tuesday night, Trump repeatedly insulted Haley and gave a far angrier speech than after his Iowa victory, when his message was one of Republican unity. Lets not have someone take a victory when she had a very bad night, Trump said. He added, Just a little note to Nikki: Shes not going to win. With easy wins in both early states, Trump is demonstrating an ability to unite the GOPs factions firmly behind him. Hes garnered support from the evangelical conservatives who are influential in Iowa and New Hampshires more moderate voters, strength he hopes to replicate during the general election. Trump posted especially strong results in the states most conservative areas, while Haley won more liberal parts. The only areas in which Haley was leading Trump were in Democratic-leaning cities and towns such as Concord, Keene and Portsmouth. Pat Sheridan, a 63-year-old engineer from Hampton, voted for Trump because he did a really good job the first time. We need a businessman, not bureaucrats, Sheridan said. About half of GOP primary voters said they are very or somewhat concerned that Trump is too extreme to win the general election, according to AP VoteCast, a survey of the states electorate. Only about one-third say the same about Haley. Still, Haleys path to becoming the GOP standard-bearer is narrowing quickly. She wont compete in a contest that awards delegates until South Carolinas Feb. 24 primary, bypassing the Feb. 8 Nevada caucuses that are widely seen as favoring Trump. As South Carolinas former governor, Haley is hoping a strong showing there could propel her into the March 5 Super Tuesday contests. But in a deeply conservative state where Trump is exceedingly popular, those ambitions may be tough to realize and a home-state loss could prove politically devastating. This is just the beginning; weve got the rest of the nation, said Sandy Adams, 66, an independent from Bow who supported Haley. I think weve got a strong candidate, and the first time we have just two candidates, and thats a great thing. On the Democratic side, Biden won his partys primary but had to do so via a write-in effort. The Democratic National Committee voted to start its primary next month in South Carolina, but New Hampshire pushed ahead with its own contest. Biden didnt campaign or appear on the ballot but topped a series of little-known challengers. Trumps early sweep through the Republican primary is remarkable considering he faces 91 criminal charges related to everything from seeking to overturn the 2020 presidential election to mishandling classified documents and arranging payoffs to a porn actress. He left the White House in 2021 in the grim aftermath of an insurrection at the U.S. Capitol led by his supporters who sought to stop the certification of Bidens win. And Trump was the first president to be impeached twice. Beyond the political vulnerabilities associated with the criminal cases, Trump faces a logistical challenge in balancing trials and campaigning. He has frequently appeared voluntarily at a New York courtroom where a jury is considering whether he should pay additional damages to a columnist who last year won a 5 million jury award against Trump for sex abuse and defamation. He has turned these appearances into campaign events, holding televised news conferences that give him an opportunity to spread his message to a large audience. But Trump has turned those vulnerabilities into an advantage among GOP voters. He has argued that the criminal prosecutions reflect a politicized Justice Department, though theres no evidence that officials there were pressured by Biden or anyone else in the White House to file charges. Trump has also repeatedly told his supporters that hes being prosecuted on their behalf, an argument that appears to have further strengthened his bond with the GOP base. As Trump begins to pivot his attention to Biden and a general election campaign, the question is whether the former presidents framing of the legal cases will persuade voters beyond the GOP base. Trump lost the popular vote in the 2016 and 2020 elections and has faced particular struggles in suburban communities from Georgia to Pennsylvania to Arizona that could prove decisive in the fall campaign. Trump traveled frequently to New Hampshire in the months leading up to the primary but didnt spend as much time in the state as many of his rivals. Rather than the traditional approach of greeting voters personally or in small groups, Trump has staged large rallies. He has spent much of his time complaining about the past  including the lie that the 2020 election was stolen due to widespread voter fraud. If he returns to the White House, the former president has promised to enact a hardline immigration agenda that includes stopping migrants from crossing the U.S.-Mexico border and reimposing his first-term travel ban that originally targeted seven Muslim-majority countries. Hes also said the rising number of immigrants entering the United States are poisoning the blood of our country, echoing Adolf Hitlers language. Biden faces his own challenges. There are widespread concerns about his age at 81 years old. Dissent is also building within his party over Bidens alliance with Israel in its war against Hamas, putting the presidents standing at risk in swing states like Michigan. A rally he held in northern Virginia on Tuesday to promote abortion rights  an issue his party sees as critical to success in November  was disrupted repeatedly by protests over U.S. military support for Israel. One person shouted shame on you! But he avoided potential embarrassment in New Hampshire even as rivals like Minnesota Rep. Dean Phillips compared him in advertising to Bigfoot  since both were hard to find. Durwood Sargent, 79, of Bow, cast a write-in vote for Biden and said he wasnt offended that the president kept his name off the ballot. Its not a big deal. Theyve made a big deal out of it. The presidents got a country to run, he said. Source - AP News - Agencies",

He was produced before Colombo Fort Magistrate Thilina Gamage earlier today. During todays proceedings, the forensic psychiatrist told the magistrate that the suspect requires psychiatric treatment. Accordingly, the magistrate ordered that Kodituwakku be further remanded and referred to psychiatric treatment through the prison. Kodituwakku was arrested by the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) on January 15, on charges of committing irreligious activities that are contrary to Buddhist teachings. Subsequently, on court orders, the self-styled Avalokiteshvara Bodhisattva was placed behind bars on remand custody. Earlier this month, the president of Buddhist Information Centre, Ven. Agulugalle Sri Jinananda Thero had filed a complaint with the CID alleging that Kodituwakku has been misleading the Buddhist community. Alleging that Kodituwakku has been misleading the Buddhist community, Jinananda Thero claimed that he was directly involved with the recently deceased preacher named Ruwan Prasanna Gunaratna, who had promoted mass suicide through his distorted teachings and later died by suicide. Meanwhile, Ven. Balangoda Kassapa Thero, addressing a media briefing, claimed that this self-proclaimed Bodhisattva had sexually abused his own daughter before leaving his house while calling it Abinishkramanaya (Great Departure). Bodhisattvas are enlightened beings on the path to becoming Buddhas but postpone reaching nirvana to help humanity. Kodituwakku has come under fire for impersonating a Bodhisattva and distorting Buddhist teachings.",

        "date": "January 24, 2024 03:29 pm",
        "content": "A Russian military transport plane carrying 65 Ukrainian prisoners of war, six crew and three people accompanying them crashed on Wednesday morning in Russias Belgorod region near Ukraine, Russias Defense Ministry said. It wasnt immediately clear what caused the crash, which occurred around 11 a.m. It was also not known if anyone survived. The authorities were investigating the cause of the crash, and a special military commission was on the way to the crash site, the Defense Ministry said. Earlier Wednesday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said a major Russian missile attack that apparently was devised to overwhelm Ukraines air defenses had killed 18 people and injured 130. Ukraine is marking the 700th day since the full-scale invasion by Kremlins forces started. The barrage employing more than 40 ballistic, cruise, anti-aircraft and guided missiles early Tuesday hit 130 residential buildings in three Ukrainian cities, all ordinary houses, Zelenskyy said on X, formerly Twitter. Russias onslaught, which included targets in the capital Kyiv and second-largest city Kharkiv, was the heaviest in weeks and lent weight to Zelenskyys appeals for Western allies to provide more military aid. This year, the main priority is to strengthen air defense to protect our cities and towns, as well as defend frontline positions, Zelenskyy said on X late Tuesday. With the 1,500-kilometer (930-mile) front line largely static amid icy weather and as both sides seek to replenish their weapons stockpiles, the war recently has focused on long-range strikes. Analysts say Russia stockpiled missiles to pursue a winter campaign of aerial bombardment, while Ukraine has sought to strike inside Russia with new types of drones. Russia may have employed decoy missiles in Tuesdays attack in an effort to open up holes in Ukraines air defenses, a U.S. think tank said. The Washington-based Institute for the Study of War said Moscow is likely trying to acquire more ballistic missiles from foreign countries, including Iran and North Korea, because they may be more effective in some circumstances. A further barrage of Russian S-300 missiles struck residential districts of Kharkiv late Tuesday, injuring nine people and damaging residential buildings, regional Gov. Oleh Syniehubov said. Russia denies its forces strike civilian areas, although there is substantial evidence to the contrary. The Russian Defense Ministry said that air defenses shot down four Ukrainian drones over the Oryol region of western Russia early Wednesday. Oryol Mayor Yuri Parakhin said that several drones were downed over the city. He said there were no casualties, but windows were shattered in several apartment buildings in the city. Another Ukrainian drone was downed early Wednesday over the Belgorod border region, according to regional Gov. Vyacheslav Gladkov. He said there were no casualties or damage. Ukraines allies have promised to keep sending military aid packages, even though their resources are stretched. Help from the United States, by far Ukraines single biggest provider, has also hit political snags. The German defense ministry announced Wednesday that it plans to send six SEA KING Mk41 multi-role helicopters from Bundeswehr stocks to Ukraine. Since the beginning of the war military deliveries from Germany have amounted to around 6 billion euros (6.52 billion), including substantial anti-aircraft and air defense systems, the government said.  Il-76 military plane crashes in Belgorod region There were 63 people on board, Russian media reported. All of them died The estimated value of the plane is 27 million dollars. The Russian Defense Ministry said that there were Ukrainian prisoners on board the plane. The pic.twitter.com3doCOmZuX7  NEXTA (nexta_tv) January 24, 2024 Source: The Associated Press --Agencies",

        "date": "January 24, 2024 03:48 pm",
        "content": "The Human Rights Watch (HRW) states that Sri Lankas proposed Online Safety Bill will create broad and vague new speech-related offences punishable by lengthy prison terms, while critically threatening the right to freedom of expression. A repressive new internet law that Sri Lankan President Ranil Wickremesinghe is trying to rush through parliament this week would create broad and vague new speech-related offences punishable by lengthy prison terms. The law would seriously threaten the right to freedom of expression as Sri Lanka prepares for parliamentary and presidential elections later this year, it said in a statement. The proposed law, the Online Safety Bill, purportedly provides protections against online harassment, abuse, and fraud, the statement mentioned, highlighting that instead, it is mostly concerned with creating a new Online Safety Commission, appointed by the president, that can decide what online speech is false or harmful, remove content, restrict and prohibit internet access, and prosecute individuals and organizations. Furthermore, the international non-governmental organization also states that the commission-appointed experts would be empowered to enter and search suspects premises. Offences under the law carry hefty fines and prison sentences up to five years. The United Nations Human Rights Office said the law could potentially criminalize nearly all forms of legitimate expression, creating an environment that has a chilling effect on freedom of expression. The Asia Internet Coalition, an industry body including tech giants such as Google, Apple, and Meta, has called the bill a draconian system to stifle dissent and warned it could undermine the potential growth of Sri Lankas digital economy, it added. Sri Lanka is still reeling from an economic crisis partly caused by misgovernment and failures of accountability. In 2022, months-long protests demanding reform toppled the prime minister and president. Since coming to power that year, President Wickremesinghe has moved to stifle dissent. Other repressive legislation before parliament includes a new broadcasting law, which the UN experts say could be used to suppress dissenting voices, and a counterterrorism law that grants wide powers to the police - and to the military - to stop, question and search, and to arrest and detain people, with inadequate judicial oversight, the statement mentioned. Meanwhile, it has also expressed that according to the International Monetary Fund, which is supporting Sri Lankas economy, restrictions on civil society, including the broad application of counter-terrorism rules, already limit oversight and monitoring of government actions, contributing to severe governance weaknesses and corruption vulnerabilities. Sri Lankas repressive laws have facilitated widespread human rights violations for decades and contributed to economic and political crises, the Human Rights Watch stressed, adding that passing the Online Safety Bill would be a disastrous setback.",

        "content": "UN Women and Chrysalis  a Sri Lanka-based women and youth empowering organization, with funding from the Government of Japan, has provided productive assets worth LKR 110 million (approx. USD 343,000) to 600 women-led micro-enterprises to help expand their businesses. This initiative was undertaken as part of a larger one-year project Empowering Women in Crisis starting in February 2023. Through this project, UN Women and implementing partner Chrysalis have provided humanitarian assistance for women most affected by the socioeconomic crisis in Sri Lanka - in close collaboration with the Ministry of Women, Child Affairs and Social Empowerment. Speaking at an event held in Battaramulla, Mizukoshi Hideaki, the Ambassador of Japan to Sri Lanka stated: The Embassy of Japan is pleased to have supported this tremendous initiative which is being carried out in 5 Districts in Sri Lanka and we look forward to continuing this partnership with UN Women to support womens economic empowerment in the country. In light of soaring food inflation and rising cost of living, the entrepreneurs further received provisions to support their daily needs, thus enabling them to allocate more resources towards their business ventures. Present at the event, Sarah Knibbs, Deputy Regional Director, UN Women Regional Office for Asia and the Pacific highlighted: As part of this project funded by the Government of Japan, we have provided 600 women-led micro-enterprises with advanced training on business development including the introduction to digital tools and resources to better market their products. Through the project, the entrepreneurs received comprehensive training ranging from product ideation to financial literacy and were introduced to new tools such as digital marketing to expand their businesses. Taking part in UN Womens training opened a world of possibilities for me. I learned about social media platforms and their potential for online business operations. With the help of my children, I now manage my own social media page, leveraging platforms like Facebook and YouTube to showcase my products. This helped me solve the issue of dwindling demand as I reached a lot more customers in a shorter time, said Tharsan Vaksala (32), an entrepreneur and participant of the programme, from Kanakarayankulam in the Northern Province. The project supports women-led micro-enterprises in the Districts of Ampara, Colombo, Monaragala, Mullaitivu and Vavuniya.",

        "date": "January 24, 2024 04:21 pm",
        "content": "Turkish legislators on Tuesday endorsed Swedens membership in NATO, lifting a major hurdle on the previously nonaligned countrys entry into the military alliance. Lawmakers ratified Swedens accession protocol 287 to 55, with ruling party members saying the Nordic countrys tougher stance on Kurdish militants was key to winning approval. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan also previously has linked the ratification to Turkeys desire to buy fighter jets from the U.S. The ratification comes into effect after its publication in the Official Gazette, which was expected to be swift. Hungary then becomes the only NATO ally not to have ratified Swedens accession. Today we are one step closer to becoming a full member of NATO, Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson wrote on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter. In Washington, U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan welcomed the news, saying having Sweden in the alliance will make it safer and stronger. NATO-member Turkey had been delaying Swedens membership for more than a year, accusing the country of being too lenient toward groups that Ankara regards as security threats. It sought concessions from Stockholm, including moves to counter militants. Turkey also had been angered by a series of demonstrations by supporters of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, in Sweden as well as Quran-burning protests that roiled Muslim countries. Sweden in the past was a center in Europe for the PKK, Fuat Oktay, a senior legislator in Erdogans governing party and the head of the foreign affairs committee, told parliament. But since then, Sweden has amended its anti-terrorism laws, curbed the PKKs financial activities, convicted a terrorism suspect and extradited another, and lifted restrictions on arms sales to Turkey, Oktay said. PKK-affiliated circles no longer find a comfortable room for maneuver in Sweden as they did in the past, Oktay said, explaining why the ruling party was now supporting Stockholms bid. Sweden pledged deeper cooperation with Turkey on counterterrorism, as well as support for Turkeys ambition to revive its EU membership bid. Last month, parliaments foreign affairs committee gave its consent to Swedens bid in the first stage of the legislative process, after Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan sent its accession protocol to lawmakers for approval. Turkeys main opposition party also supported Swedens membership in the alliance but a center-right party and the countrys pro-Kurdish party were among parties that opposed it. Swedens steps concerning its extradition of wanted criminals or the fight against terrorism have remained limited and insufficient, Musavat Dervisoglu, a legislator from the Good Party told parliament. Erdogan has linked ratification of Swedens NATO membership to the U.S. Congress approval of a Turkish request to purchase 40 new F-16 fighter jets and kits to modernize Turkeys existing fleet. He has also urged Canada and other NATO allies to lift arms embargoes on Turkey. Koray Aydin, another Good Party legislator, had urged parliament to hold out on ratifying Swedens accession until the F-16 sales and the modernization kits were approved in Washington, saying Turkey would lose an important bargaining chip. U.S. President Joe Bidens administration never formally tied the sale of the F-16s to Turkeys ratification of Swedens NATO membership. However, numerous influential members of Congress had said they would not support the sale unless and until Turkey signed off on Swedens accession to the alliance. U.S. administration officials say they expect relatively quick action on the F-16 sale after the ratification. Sullivan, the U.S. national security advisor, said after Tuesdays vote that Swedens accession to the alliance has been a priority for Biden. Sweden is a strong, capable defense partner. Sweden joining NATO is in the national security interests of the United States, and will make the Alliance safer and stronger, he said. Sweden and Finland abandoned their traditional positions of military nonalignment to seek protection under NATOs security umbrella, following Russias invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Finland joined the alliance in April, becoming NATOs 31st member, after Turkeys parliament ratified the Nordic countrys bid. Hungary has also stalled Swedens bid, alleging that Swedish politicians have told blatant lies about the condition of Hungarys democracy. Hungary has said it would not be the last to approve accession, although it was not clear when the Hungarian parliament intends to hold a vote. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán announced Tuesday that he sent a letter to his Swedish counterpart, Ulf Kristersson, inviting him to Budapest to discuss Swedens entry into NATO. NATO requires the unanimous approval of all existing members to expand, and Turkey and Hungary were the only countries that have been holding out, frustrating other NATO allies who had been pressing for Sweden and Finlands swift accession.

The bill was approved when the Sectoral Oversight Committee met in Parliament on Monday (22) under the chairmanship of the MP Lalith Warankumara. Thus, the bill, which was tabled in Parliament by Minister of Public Security Tiran Alles was taken for the second reading debate on Tuesday (23) and Wednesday (24). The Online Safety Bill, published in the government gazette on September 18, aims to ban online communication of certain statements in the country, prevent the use of online accounts  both authentic and inauthentic  for the use of prohibited purposes, to suppress the financing and other support of communication of false statements and other related matters. However, the Bill has come under fire for some of its problematic aspects, with the Asia Internet Coalition (AIC) which consists of multiple tech giants including Apple, Facebook, Google, Amazon, and Yahoo, the International Commission of Jurists (ICJ), the Bar Association of Sri Lanka (BASL), and the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka (HRCSL) voicing concerns. A total of 45 petitions had been put forward by Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith, Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB), National Peoples Power (NPP), journalist Tharindu Uduwaragedara and many other parties, alleging that the relevant bill is in violation of the fundamental rights of freedom of speech and expression guaranteed by the Constitution. Later, the Supreme Court, after concluding the deliberation of petitions, communicated its determination on the constitutionality of the Bill and its provisions to President Ranil Wickremesinghe and Speaker of Parliament, emphasizing that pursuant to Article 84(2) of the Constitution, Clauses 3, 5, 7, 9, 11,12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 36, 37, 42, 45, 53, and 56 should be passed by a special majority in the parliament. However, if these clauses are amended during the Committee Stage, the Online Safety Bill can be passed by a simple majority in the parliament, the Supreme Courts determination further stated.",

        "title": "Tesla plans to build new electric vehicles in mid-2025",
        "date": "January 24, 2024 05:25 pm",
        "content": "Tesla has told suppliers it wants to start production of a new mass market electric vehicle codenamed Redwood in mid-2025, according to four people familiar with the matter, with two of them describing the model as a compact crossover. Tesla CEO Elon Musk has long whetted fans and investors appetites for affordable electric vehicles and self-driving robotaxis that are expected to be made on next-generation, cheaper electric car platforms. Those models, including an entry-level 25,000 car, would allow it to compete with cheaper gasoline-powered cars and a growing number of inexpensive EVs, such as those made by Chinas BYD. BYD overtook Tesla as the worlds top EV maker in the final quarter of 2023. Musk had first promised to build a 25,000 car in 2020, a plan he later shelved and then revived. Teslas cheapest offering, the Model 3 sedan, currently has a starting price of 38,990 in the United States. Musk said last year he was concerned about the impact of high interest rates on consumer demand for big-ticket items like cars. Tesla sent requests for quotes, or invitation for bids for the Redwood model, to suppliers last year, and forecast weekly production volume of 10,000 vehicles, two of the sources said. Production would begin in June 2025, three of the sources said. All spoke on condition of anonymity because the matter is confidential. Tesla did not respond to a request for comment. Timing of next-generation compact vehicles was one of the most voted questions by investors to Tesla ahead of its quarterly results report on Wednesday afternoon, where it is expected to forecast a 21 rise in 2024 deliveries, well below the long-term annual target of 50 that Musk set about three years ago. Musk said in May that Tesla was working on two new products, with the potential for combined sales of 5 million vehicles a year. Both the design of the products and manufacturing techniques are head and shoulders above anything else that is present in the industry, he said at Teslas annual shareholder meeting. Tesla plans to make an inexpensive robotaxi and an entry-level, 25,000 electric car based on the same vehicle architecture, according to Walter Isaacsons biography of Musk released in September, which includes interviews with the CEO and executives. Musk said in 2022 that Tesla would make a dedicated self-driving taxi with a futuristic look in 2024, after several misses at its goal of achieving full self-driving capability. He and other Tesla executives laid out plans last March to halve the cost of its next-generation vehicles, but did not provide a timeframe for the launches. STUDYING A HONDA CIVIC Tesla has a track record of missing its targets for launches and pricing, and it would take time to build volume. Cybertruck production, for instance, has been delayed and slow to accelerate and its 60,990 U.S. starting price is 50 higher than Musk touted in 2019. They have been overly optimistic on most of their new product launches. Volume output is more likely to begin in 2026, one of the sources said. Musk said last year the affordable model would initially be built at Teslas factory in Texas. Making a profit from the cheaper EVs will be challenging, given the costs of batteries as well as traditional difficulties producing quality inexpensive vehicles. Tesla in recent years tore down a Honda (7267.T), Civic, whose price starts at 23,950 in the United States, to study how to make cheaper cars, two separate sources said. The next-generation Tesla architecture, internally called NV9X, will include two or more models, said the two people and one of the initial sources. Tesla also plans to build cheaper cars at its factory near Berlin, and is interested in building a factory in India to produce less expensive electric cars, sources said previously. The EV maker also has factories in Shanghai and in Fremont, California. Source - Reuters - Agencies",

In a joint statement issued on Wednesday (24 Jan.), the collective of Information Technology (IT) and Business Process Management (BPM) industry stakeholders raised four key concerns regarding the controversial Bill. They claimed that certain provisions holding online platforms and social media networks liable were impractical, and risked an economic setback or Sri Lanka. Further, the IT and BPM industry stakeholders stated that the proposed Bill may impose a significant financial burden on the industry. Speaking with regards to the impact the proposed Bill has on international human rights and the international cooperation, the joint statement read that Potential violations of ICCPR could tarnish Sri Lankas ITBPM industry reputation internationally, emphasizing the need for alignment with accepted regulations, adding that concerns have also been raised regarding the latter about the potential reductions in our authorities ability to engage in international cooperation for data and electronic evidence gathering. Thus, the collective of industry stakeholders made the following recommendations to be considered by the government: 1. Inclusive Stakeholder Consultations: Call for wider consultations with stakeholders to ensure a comprehensive understanding of industry needs. 2. Alignment with International Standards: Modify or remove provisions conflicting with ICCPR and other international regulations to strike a balance between security and fundamental rights. 3. Careful Definition of Provisions: Advocate for narrower definitions to prevent unintended consequences and ensure compatibility with human rights principles. SLASSCOM, FITIS, CSSL and BCS Sri Lanka emphasize the importance of safeguarding Sri Lankas digital economy and call on the government to collaborate in developing legislation that balances security and industry interests, the statement concluded.",

        "date": "January 25, 2024 10:08 am",
        "content": "Russia accused Ukraine on Wednesday of deliberately shooting down a Russian military transport plane carrying 65 captured Ukrainian soldiers to a prisoner exchange in what it called a barbaric act of terrorism that had killed a total of 74 people. Ukraine called for full clarification of the circumstances of the incident and did not directly confirm it had shot down the plane. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, in his evening address said: It is clear that the Russians are playing with the lives of Ukrainian prisoners, the feelings of their loved ones and the emotions of our society. The Russian defence ministry said six Russian crew members and three Russian soldiers had been on the Ilyushin Il-76 military transport plane shot down near the Russian city of Belgorod near the Ukrainian border. After a long pause, the Ukrainian military said it would continue to destroy Russian military transport aircraft it believed were carrying missiles with which to strike Ukraine. It said it had noticed more Russian military transport aircraft landing in Belgorod, something it linked to Russian missile strikes on Kharkiv and other Ukrainian cities. Air Force Commander Mykola Oleshchuk accused Russia of trying to undermine international support for Ukraine. Ukraine has the right to defend itself and destroy the means of the aggressors aerial attack, he said. The Russian defence ministry said the exchange was to have taken place on Wednesday afternoon at the Kolotilovka border checkpoint and Ukraine knew a transport plane carrying captured Ukrainian soldiers was expected at the Belgorod airfield. By committing this terrorist act, the Ukrainian leadership has showed its true face. It disregarded the lives of its own citizens, the ministry said in a statement. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov called for a meeting of the U.N. Security Council and said Russia sought to establish the reasons behind the Ukrainian criminal act. A French spokesperson at the U.N. said the meeting would be held at 5 p.m. (2200 GMT) on Thursday. Ukraines GUR military intelligence agency said Ukraine had not been asked to ensure airspace security around Belgorod unlike previous swaps and had not been informed about what means of transport would be used and which routes. On this basis, we may be talking about planned and deliberate actions by Russia to destabilise the situation in Ukraine and weaken international support for our state, GUR said in a statement on Telegram. Russias defence ministry said radar operators had detected the launch of two Ukrainian missiles at the time of the crash. If the details are confirmed, it would be the deadliest incident of its kind inside Russias internationally recognised borders during the almost two-year-old war. UKRAINE SAYS PRISONER SWAP WAS SCHEDULED Ukraines intelligence agency confirmed a prisoner swap had been planned for Wednesday and said the captured Russian servicemen had been delivered to the agreed exchange point on time and were safe. Landing a transport plane in a 30-km combat zone cannot be safe and in any case must be discussed by both sides, because otherwise it jeopardises the entire exchange process, it said. It had no reliable information about who was on the downed plane, it added. Video footage posted on Telegram by Baza, a channel linked to Russian security services, and verified by Reuters, showed a large aircraft falling to the ground near the village of Yablonovo in Belgorod region and exploding in a fireball. Andrei Kartapolov, a member of Russias parliament and a retired general, told the SHOT news outlet it was impossible for operators of Ukrainian surface-to-air missile systems to mistake transport planes for military planes or helicopters as targets. It was done deliberately to sabotage the prisoner exchange, said Kartapolov, saying a second Russian Il-76 transport plane carrying around 80 Ukrainian soldiers to the exchange had managed to turn around. Kartapolov, who has close links to the Russian defence ministry, said the plane had been downed by three missiles of either U.S. or German manufacture. Reuters could not immediately verify details of who was on board the downed plane, but Moscow and Kyiv have regularly swapped prisoners since Russia began what it calls its special military operation in Ukraine in February 2022. The Belgorod region, which borders Ukraine, has come under frequent attack from Ukraine in recent months, including a December missile strike which killed 25 people. Source: Reuters -Agencies",

With elections taking place in almost half of Finchs rated portfolio of Asia Pacific (APAC) sovereigns in 2024, including Pakistan where general polls are scheduled for February 8, the agency on Wednesday shared the possibility in its forecast report, mentioning the chance of election outcomes influencing credit profiles as being higher in both Pakistan and Sri Lanka, which also gets its funds from the IMF. Other countries where elections are slated to be conducted include in India, Sri Lanka, Indonesia and Korea. We view the chance of election outcomes influencing credit profiles as being higher in Pakistan and Sri Lanka, which both will remain dependent in the next few years on successful IMF programme implementation and official support, the forecast stated. Reform momentum, it added, has slowed in the run-up to elections and the policy agendas of the next governments could affect credit profiles. However, the agency generally expects policy continuity to be the main theme in most places. Fitch also stated that the situation during elections will lead to some uncertainty. In its report, the agency said that the Asia-Pacific region should largely remain resilient in 2024 to the several challenges it will face, including slowing global growth, high yields, geopolitics and lingering property-sector issues in China. Meanwhile, rating actions in 2023 were mostly on frontier markets and included a downgrade of Pakistan to CCC- in February and a subsequent upgrade to CCC in July, both related to changes in its external financing outlook, the agency said. GDP growth will mostly be higher for APAC sovereigns than for their peers in other regions. It forecast growth below the peer median for only a few APAC sovereigns, namely Japan, New Zealand and Pakistan. The agency stated that growth should be supported by a gradual upturn in the global tech cycle and relatively robust domestic demand in some places. Weak global growth will likely weigh on demand for Asias electronics production and exports, but some high-frequency data, for instance from Singapore and Korea, are pointing to the start of an upward trend in the generally short tech cycle, helped by technological developments, such as 5G and AI. According to Fitch, fiscal outlooks will vary, but high borrowing costs and mostly modest fiscal deficit reductions will cause debt ratios to rise in 2024 in about half of the APAC sovereigns despite solid growth rates. A rising government debt ratio combined with significant contingent liabilities, is gradually becoming more challenging for China, it stated. Source: Geo News --Agencies",

        "title": "Major blow to human rights: Amnesty International slams newly passed Online Safety Bill",
        "date": "January 25, 2024 12:20 pm",
        "content": "Amnesty International says the Online Safety Bill, freshly passed in Sri Lanka parliament on Wednesday (Jan.24), is a major blow to human rights in the country. Commenting in this regard, Thyagi Ruwanpathirana, Regional Researcher for South Asia at the international rights organisation said this legislation is the newest weapon in the governments arsenal of tools that could be used to undermine freedom of expression and suppress dissent. She urged the Sri Lankan authorities to immediately withdraw the Online Safety Bill and ensure respect for the human rights of everyone in the country. The Online Safety Bill, which seeks to regulate online content, received the parliamentary majority on Wednesday evening, amidst objections from opposition politicians and activists who raised alarm that the new law would muzzle free speech. The Second Reading of the Online Safety Bill was also passed in Parliament by a majority of 46 votes. A total of 108 MPs had voted in favour, while 62 had voted against the Bill. The division was followed by a committee stage debate, during which a contentious situation ensued as opposition MPs objected to certain amendments brought by the ruling party, accusing them of being unconstitutional and in violation of the Supreme Court determination. The Online Safety Bill proposes jail terms for content that a five-member commission considers illegal and makes social media platforms such as Google, Facebook and X (formerly known as Twitter), liable for those posted on their platforms. Dismissing the accusations, the government has defended the Bill, saying that it is aimed at battling cybercrimes including child abuse, data theft and online fraud. Yet, many rights organizations, activists and civil society members, including the Asian Internet Coalition (AIC), International Commission of Jurists (ICJ), Bar Association of Sri Lanka (BASL), and Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka (HRCSL) have voiced deep concerns about the problematic aspects of certain provisions of the Bill. Commenting further on the passing of the new law to regulate online content, Ruwanpathirana said many parts of the Bill do not meet international human rights standards including overbroad provisions that would restrict the enjoyment of the rights to freedom of expression and privacy online, and vaguely worded, subjective offences such as prohibited statements as determined and declared by a powerful Online Safety Commission. As people grapple with and voice their concerns amid hardships during Sri Lankas economic crisis and the impact of governments austerity measures, this legislation will be ripe for misuse by authorities and will be used to further restrict civic space, and crackdown on critics and opposition. In a year of elections, with a long history of cracking down on protests, the Sri Lankan authorities must demonstrate the political will to uphold their international human rights obligations and commitments by guaranteeing and ensuring respect for human rights before, during and after elections, Ruwanpathirana added.",

        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe, addressing the 30th Annual General Meeting of the Lanka Confectionary Manufacturers Association (LCMA) on Wednesday (24) at Cinnamon Grand Hotel, Colombo emphasized the potential for Sri Lanka to become a global player in the confectionery industry. He encouraged Sri Lankan confectioners to expand their horizons and tap into international markets. Acknowledging the success of Sri Lankan teas and cinnamon globally, the President posed the question, How long before I can take chocolates and go?

The arrestee was identified as the driver of the SUV used by the assailants and is also suspected of having orchestrated the mass shooting which took place on Monday (Jan.22). The 55-year-old named Saman Kumara was arrested on Thursday (Jan.24) in Akuressa and earlier in the day, the vehicle used by the assailants was found parked near the Vidyaloka Pirivena in Galle.

        "title": "We must boost countrys income, transitioning to positive economic trajectory - President",
        "date": "January 25, 2024 10:59 pm",
        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe on Thursday (Jan.25) underscored his commitment to guiding the countrys progress in the coming years, drawing inspiration from the success of Biyagama. Reflecting on his early political career in the Biyagama Constituency, where the region experienced notable underdevelopment, the President emphasized the positive impact of strategic economic decisions, particularly the establishment of the Biyagama Investment Zone. He noted that Biyagamas rapid progress stands as a testament to those decisions. The Head of State underscored his vision for replicating such success nationwide by leveraging the advantages of an open economy. He expressed plans to establish new investment zones across the country, with the aim of significantly boosting the national economy. Recalling his recent visit to Switzerland, President Wickremesinghe said world leaders were amazed to hear how rapidly Sri Lanka has turned itself around and how its once-bankrupt economy has rebounded. He said that although Sri Lanka has managed to achieve economic stability by engaging with the heads of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF), its revenues remain insufficient. To address this, we must enhance the countrys income, transitioning from a negative to a positive economic trajectory. In order to generate employment opportunities, President Wickremesinghe noted that it is imperative to establish new industries and investment prospects. Efforts are underway to cultivate a conducive environment for this purpose, with plans to replicate successful models like the Biyagama Free Trade Zone throughout the country, aiming to amplify the nations economic growth tenfold, the Head of State continued. He made these remarks during the inauguration of the newly constructed ancient Bodhi Prakaraya and Golden Fence at Sapugaskanda Abeysekararama, this morning. Speaking further, President Wickremesinghe stated, Abeysekararama held a significant position in this area. My first visit to this place was in my capacity as the Biyagama Constituency Organizer and the United National Partys candidate for Biyagama. During that time, Biyagama was characterized by significant underdevelopment. Some individuals suggested that only Agalawatta surpassed Biyagama in terms of underdevelopment. However, it was pointed out that Agalawatta had tea plantations, rubber plantations and tea factories, whereas Biyagama only had an oil refinery. Some claimed that this constituency lacked economic activity, resembling more of a bedroom where people left in the morning only to return in the evening to sleep. Despite these perceptions, during those elections, I resided in a house nearby. My office operated from a building on the land adjacent to Abeysekararama. Additionally, my mother advised us to visit Abeysekararama on the night before the general election to seek blessings. Consequently, I visited this temple, met Ven. Ther and received blessings. I wont reiterate the election results. My political journey began here, culminating in the presidency through unconventional means. I assumed this responsibility when the government collapsed and there was a void in leadership. Taking charge during a period of economic ruin, where people struggled for survival without essential resources like fuel and gas, I felt compelled to step in. Recognizing the imminent threat to the country, I assumed the presidency with the conviction that I could rescue and rebuild our nation. Two years have elapsed and today we are steadily returning to normalcy, with no shortages in sight. Rebuilding the economy posed challenges, but we are making gradual progress. During my visit to Switzerland, I informed world leaders that Sri Lankas once-bankrupt economy has successfully rebounded, surprising many with the rapid turnaround. Engaging with the heads of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, we achieved economic stability, yet our revenues remain insufficient. To address this, we must enhance the countrys income, transitioning from a negative to a positive economic trajectory. To generate employment opportunities, it is imperative to establish new industries and investment prospects. Efforts are underway to cultivate a conducive environment for this purpose, with plans to replicate successful models like the Biyagama Free Trade Zone throughout the country, aiming to amplify the nations economic growth tenfold. Biyagama serves as an illustrative example. Despite its initial lack of development, the belief in its potential for growth under an open economy prevailed. Inspired by the success of the first investment zone in Katunayake initiated by late President J.R Jayawardena, efforts were made to designate Biyagama as the second Free Trade Zone, overcoming scepticism about its development potential. Initiatives were undertaken to launch the Biyagama Free Trade Zone and enhance infrastructure in the region. From its early days as an underdeveloped province, Biyagama has evolved into a thriving hub today, and the Biyagama and Katunayake Free Trade Zones are now recognized as premier investment zones in South Asia. At the outset, Biyagama had only 15 factories, which has grown to 58 today. Additionally, the region now hosts 180 large factories and 275 medium and small factories. The economic landscape has transformed with the emergence of 4,227 shops, 597 canteens, 316 electrical shops, and 2 tourist hotels. This comprehensive economic development in Biyagama has also positively impacted the growth of Kelaniya. Biyagama, taking full advantage of the open economy, has seen remarkable progress, while neighbouring areas like Kelaniya are also advancing. Future plans include the transformation of Dalugama, Kiribathgoda, Makola, Mawaramandiya, and Kadawata into significant economic hubs. The development model applied to Biyagama is set to be replicated in other provinces across the island, including Bingiriya, Kandy, Hambantota, Trincomalee, and the North, aiming to amplify the national economy tenfold. --PMD",

        "date": "January 26, 2024 08:12 am",
        "content": "Two more individuals have been arrested for allegedly aiding and abetting the mass shooting in Beliatta in which five people were killed earlier this week. The arrest was made by the Police Special Task Force (STF) in Wanchawala and Megalle areas in Galle on Thursday (Jan.25) as part of the ongoing island-wide Yukthiya operation to crack down on narcotics distribution and organized crimes. STF officers have seized 9 grams and 300 milligrams of heroin, a knife, 3 mobile phones and a motorcycle from the possession of the suspects. The duo, aged 25 and 35 years, has been handed over to the Galle Harbour police station for onward investigations. The investigating officers have uncovered that the two arrestees were involved in orchestrating the mass shooting to be carried out near the Tangalle court premises. Notorious underworld figure Kosgoda Sujee had reportedly contracted the drug trafficker operating under the alias Uragaha Michael for the killings. On Monday (Jan.22), a group of persons who had arrived in an SUV had opened fire at a white Defender near the Beliatta Interchange of the Southern Expressway. In the shooting, which took place between 8:30 a.m. and 8:40 a.m., four persons were killed at the scene. The other person who was inside the Defender was rushed to the Tangalle Hospital with critical gunshot wounds, however, he succumbed to injuries shortly after. Among the deceased was the leader of Ape Jana Bala Pakshaya (Our Power of People Party or OPPP) Saman Perera. The other four victims were identified as Sameera Madhusanka, Hasitha Chinsuka, Buddhika Rajapaksha, and Nalin Champika. Meanwhile, another person, who was identified as the driver of the SUV used by the assailants, was arrested on Wednesday (Jan.24) over his involvement in orchestrating the murders. On the same day, the SUV used by the assailants was found parked near the Vidyaloka Pirivena in Galle. On Thursday (Jan.25), the Deiyandara Magistrate ordered that the 55-year-old named Saman Kumara be detained until tomorrow for further interrogations. Based on the information divulged by the suspect during questioning, the investigating officers managed to locate a motorcycle and a van linked to the perpetrators. The police believe that they had used the motorcycle to dispose of the two T56 firearms used in the shooting and that the van had been arranged for them to move under the radar.",

        "title": "Alabama executes a man with nitrogen gas, a first in the world",
        "date": "January 26, 2024 10:00 am",
        "content": "Alabama executed a convicted murderer with nitrogen gas Thursday, putting him to death with a first-of-its-kind method that once again put the US at the forefront of the debate over capital punishment. The state said the method would be humane, but critics called it cruel and experimental. Officials said Kenneth Eugene Smith, 58, was pronounced dead at 8:25 pm at an Alabama prison after breathing pure nitrogen gas through a face mask to cause oxygen deprivation. It marked the first time that a new execution method has been used in the United States since lethal injection, now the most commonly used method, was introduced in 1982. The state had previously attempted to execute Smith, who was convicted of a 1988 murder-for-hire, in 2022, but the lethal injection was called off at the last minute because authorities couldnt connect an IV line. The execution came after a last-minute legal battle in which Smiths attorneys contended the state was making him the test subject for an experimental execution method that could violate the constitutional ban on cruel and unusual punishment. Federal courts rejected Smiths bid to block it, with the latest ruling coming Thursday night from the US Supreme Court. Liberal judges dissent in Supreme Court ruling Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who along with two other liberal justices dissented, wrote: Having failed to kill Smith on its first attempt, Alabama has selected him as its guinea pigto test a method of execution never attempted before. The world is watching. The majority justices did not issue any statements. In a statement issued before he was put to death, Smith and the Rev. Jeff Hood, his spiritual adviser , said, The eyes of the world are on this impending moral apocalypse. Our prayer is that people will not turn their heads. We simply cannot normalize the suffocation of each other. The state had predicted the nitrogen gas would cause unconsciousness within seconds and death within minutes. A state attorney told the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals that it will be the most painless and humane method of execution known to man. But some doctors and organizations have raised alarm, and Smiths attorneys had asked the Supreme Court to halt the execution to review claims that the method violates the constitutional ban on cruel and unusual punishment and deserves more legal scrutiny before it is used on a person. Little research There is little research regarding death by nitrogen hypoxia. When the State is considering using a novel form of execution that has never been attempted anywhere, the public has an interest in ensuring the State has researched the method adequately and established procedures to minimize the pain and suffering of the condemned person, Smiths attorneys wrote. In her dissent, Sotomayor wrote that Alabama has shrouded its execution protocol in secrecy, releasing only a heavily redacted version. She also said Smith should be allowed to obtain evidence about the execution protocol and to proceed with his legal challenge. That information is important not only to Smith, who has an extra reason to fear the gurney, but to anyone the State seeks to execute after him using this novel method, Sotomayor wrote. Twice now this Court has ignored Smiths warning that Alabama will subject him to an unconstitutional risk of pain, Sotomayor wrote. I sincerely hope that he is not proven correct a second time. Justice Elena Kagan wrote a separate dissent and was joined by Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson. Final hours In his final hours, Smith met with family members and his spiritual adviser, according to a prison spokesperson. He ate a last meal of T-bone steak, hash browns, toast and eggs slathered in A1 steak sauce, Hood said by telephone. Hes terrified at the torture that could come. But hes also at peace. One of the things he told me is he is finally getting out, Hood said. Smith was one of two men convicted in the 1988 murder-for-hire slaying of Elizabeth Sennett. Prosecutors said he and the other man were each paid 1,000 to kill Sennett on behalf of her pastor husband, who was deeply in debt and wanted to collect on insurance. The victims son, Charles Sennett Jr., said in an interview with WAAY-TV that Smith has to pay for what hes done. And some of these people out there say, Well, he doesnt need to suffer like that. Well, he didnt ask Mama how to suffer? the son said. They just did it. They stabbed her  multiple times. The execution protocol called for Smith to be strapped to a gurney in the execution chamber  the same one where he was strapped down for several hours during the lethal injection attempt  and a full facepiece supplied air respirator to be placed over his face. After he would be given a chance to make a final statement, the warden, from another room, would activate the nitrogen gas. It would be administered through the mask for at least 15 minutes or five minutes following a flatline indication on the EKG, whichever is longer, according to the state protocol. Barbarous, uncivilised method SantEgidio Community, a Vatican-affiliated Catholic charity based in Rome, had urged Alabama not to go through with the execution , saying the method is barbarous and uncivilised and would bring indelible shame to the state. And experts appointed by the UN Human Rights Council cautioned they believe the execution method could violate the prohibition on torture. Some states are looking for new ways to execute people because the drugs used in lethal injections have become difficult to find. Three states  Alabama, Mississippi and Oklahoma  have authorized nitrogen hypoxia as an execution method, but no state had attempted to use the untested method until now. Smiths attorneys had raised concerns that he could choke to death on his own vomit as the nitrogen gas flows. The state made a last-minute procedural change so he would not be allowed food in the eight hours leading up to the execution. Sennett, 45, was found dead March 18, 1988, in her home with eight stab wounds in the chest and one on each side of her neck, according to the coroner. Her husband, Charles Sennett Sr., killed himself when the investigation focused on him as a suspect, according to court documents. John Forrest Parker, the other man convicted in the slaying, was executed in 2010. Smiths 1989 conviction was overturned, but he was convicted again in 1996. The jury recommended a life sentence by 11-1, but a judge overrode that and sentenced him to death. Alabama no longer allows a judge to override a jurys death penalty decision.

This order was issued when he was produced before the Nugegoda Magistrates Court over another pending case, Ada Derana reporter said. The suspect, who was out on bail, was re-arrested on January 23 by the Criminal Investigations Department (CID) over breach of bail conditions and was presented before the Gangodawila Magistrates Court. However, later he was presented before the Colombo Magistrates Court as per the orders of the Gangodawila Magistrate. Earlier, the monk was arrested on December 12 at a private establishment in Kalagedihena by the cybercrimes unit of the Criminal Investigation Department (CID), acting on a complaint received against the self-styled monk who was residing in Ratnapura. According to police, the saffron-robed monk had allegedly issued statements demeaning Buddhism. Meanwhile, the Sangha Sabha Committee of Sri Lanka Ramanna Maha Nikaya recently unanimously decided to expel the controversial monk Ven.

        "date": "January 26, 2024 11:48 am",
        "content": "Police in Thailand have arrested a woman whose pet lion was pictured going on a joyride in the streets of Pattaya. A video that has now gone viral shows the chained lion cub seated in the back of a white, open-top Bentley. The lion was being driven about by a Sri Lankan man who has since left the country, and is believed to be a friend of the woman, Sawangjit Kosoongnern. While it is not illegal to own a lion in Thailand, it needs to be officially registered. Authorities in Thailand said Ms Sawangjit claimed to have bought the animal from a Thai man in Nakhon Pathom province, who successfully facilitated its delivery to Pattaya. However he failed to have his facility checked by officials before doing so, which made both the transfer and ownership of the animal illegal. She is therefore facing charges of possessing a controlled wild animal without permission, which carries a penalty of a years imprisonment and a fine of up to 100,000 baht (2,800; 2,200). Police were also reportedly looking to charge the Sri Lankan man, who had kept the lion in his rented pool villa, but were unable to as he is no longer in Thailand. He was due to be charged with bringing a controlled wild animal into public places, which carries jail time of up to six months and a fine of 50,000 baht. The man who sold the lion to Ms Sawangjit will also face charges of moving an animal without permission. Officials say there are currently 224 lions in Thailand that are legally owned.

        "date": "January 26, 2024 01:40 pm",
        "content": "Saudi Arabia has said it will open a shop in Riyadh selling alcohol to a select band of non-Muslim expats, the first to open in more than 70 years. The clientele will be limited to diplomatic staff, who have for years imported booze in sealed official packages known as diplomatic pouches. Saudi officials said the shop would counter the illicit trade of alcohol. Prohibition has been law since 1952, after one of King Abdulazizs sons drunkenly shot dead a British diplomat. The new store will be located in Riyadhs Diplomatic Quarter west of the city centre, according to a document seen by the AFP and Reuters news agencies. A source familiar with the plans told Reuters the shop was expected to open within weeks. There will be limitations, however:  Thirsty envoys would need to register beforehand and receive clearance by the government  No one under 21 will be allowed in the store and proper attire is required at all times inside  Drinkers will not be able to send a proxy, such as a driver  Monthly limitations would be enforced, the statement said. However - according to the document seen by AFP - these will not be particularly stringent. Patrons will be limited to 240 points of alcohol per month. One litre of spirits will be worth six points, one litre of wine three points and one litre of beer one point. There are also no suggestions that the clientele will be widened to ordinary foreigners in the kingdom without diplomatic privileges, who officially have no access to alcohol. While alcohol will become part of Riyadh life, drinkers would be wise to be mindful of where they drink and how they behave afterwards. Under current Saudi law, penalties for consumption or possession of alcohol can include fines, jail time, public flogging and deportation for unauthorised foreigners. The document also said authorities are planning a new regulatory framework that would also allow specific quantities of alcohol to be brought in by diplomats to put an end to... an uncontrolled exchange of such goods, it added. For years diplomatic staff have had to use their pouches, which cannot be tampered with by authorities in their host country, to bring in limited amounts of alcohol. The moves are the latest in a series of initiatives known as Vision 2030 to liberalise Saudi society under the crown prince and de facto ruler of the country, Mohammed bin Salman. Other Gulf states operate similar alcohol regimes. However, the UAE and Qatar also allow the sale of alcohol to non-Muslims over 21 in hotels, clubs and bars. There is no suggestion from the Saudi document that the government there is considering doing the same. While alcohol is forbidden under Islam, Saudi Arabia had until 1952 held a conciliatory attitude to its presence inside the kingdom. That changed after Mishari bin Abdulaziz Al-Saud, a prince, shot dead Cyril Ousman, the British vice-consul in Jeddah, in 1951 for refusing to pour him another drink at a function. A year later, King Abdulaziz imposed a total ban on alcohol. Mishari was convicted of murder. Source: BBC -Agencies",

        "title": "Sri Lanka Parliament prorogued",
        "date": "January 26, 2024 04:28 pm",
        "content": "Sri Lanka Parliament will be prorogued with effect from midnight on Friday (Jan.26) until February 07 (Wednesday). This marks the closure of the fourth session of the Ninth Parliament. The prorogation was communicated in a proclamation published in the government gazette by Presidents Secretary Saman Ekanayake. The Extraordinary Gazette was issued by virtue of the powers vested in the President by Article 70 of the Constitution. Accordingly, the next parliamentary session is scheduled to commence at 10:30 a.m. on February 07. When a new session kicks off, the President has the opportunity to ceremonially declare open the Parliament and preside over to present the Governments Policy Statement. In the past, it was known as the Throne Speech and was presented by the Governor. According to current practice, it is neither debated nor put to the vote. When the Parliament is prorogued, the questions and motions that have not been considered by the Parliament until then will be abolished, and the Members of Parliament thus have to take it up again in accordance with the Standing Orders. In addition, all other committees except the Liaison Committee of Parliament, Committee on High Posts, Select Committees and Sectoral Oversight Committees, should be re-constituted following the beginning of the new session. The first session of the Ninth Parliament was held from August 20, 2020 to December 12, 2021, and the second session from January 18, 2022 to July 28, 2022. The third session of the Ninth Parliament was held from August 03, 2022 to January 27, 2023.",

        "title": "President promises to facilitate meeting with IMF to clarify doubts or alternative proposals",
        "date": "January 26, 2024 05:01 pm",
        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe has extended an invitation to all political party leaders in the Parliament to engage in discussions with the Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on the implementation of the agreement with the IMF. Emphasizing the importance of unity in leading the country to success, he highlighted that withdrawing from the agreement would jeopardize the trust in Sri Lankas economy. The President stressed that the nations economy suffered due to the politics of promises, emphasizing the need for all political parties to formulate comprehensive plans for the countrys development when gearing up for an election. President Ranil Wickremesinghe made these remarks during the International Customs Day celebrations at the Colombo Customs Headquarters this morning (Jan.26). The President expressed gratitude to all members of the Customs Department for their contributions to the customs revenue in 2023. Highlighting customs tax, VAT and income tax as the three primary sources of income globally, the President stressed the importance of enhancing the efficiency of the customs service to boost the countrys revenue. He further noted that upcoming government legislation and modernization initiatives will overhaul all public revenue-generating institutions. President Ranil Wickremesinghe delivered six Certificates of Merit to customs officials for rendering exceptional services to the International Customs. The Director General of Sri Lanka Customs, Sarath Nonis, presented the Strategic Plan for 2024 to President Wickremesinghe and State Minister for Finance, Ranjith Siyambalapitiya. Additionally, a memento was presented to the President by the Director General of Sri Lanka Customs. President Ranil Wickremesinghe, offering additional remarks, stated: The Customs Department holds a significant historical position, being considered one of the oldest government departments in Sri Lanka. Historical records indicate that customs taxes were collected around 2000 years ago at the ancient port of Manthai. From the Anuradhapura era, through the Kotte era and into the Kandy era, customs revenue has played a pivotal role in the nations existence. I express my gratitude to the Customs Department for their contribution in helping us overcome the economic crisis faced in 2022. Customs duties, VAT and income taxes stand as the three primary sources of income for nations globally. In the contemporary landscape of international trade agreements, regional trade agreements and free trade agreements, our focus should be on enhancing income. To achieve this, the current customs services need to operate with efficiency. While we are unable to allocate additional staff to your department, your commendable performance highlights the potential for substantial revenue improvement. There is a considerable journey ahead, and the government is firmly committed to the comprehensive modernization of customs and other revenue departments, which includes the imminent introduction of new legislation. This initiative is a crucial component of the measures undertaken to steer the country out of the economic crisis. The decisions made in 2023 have paved the way for recovery from the economic downturn of 2022, although the journey is on-going. By the end of this year, our aim is to elevate the countrys income to 12 of the GDP. By 2026, we target a further increase to 15. To achieve this, income must be generated from the existing economy, necessitating economic development. The pressing question today is how to facilitate this economic growth. The out-dated economic system is incapable of propelling the country forward. The reliance on daily loans led to the collapse of the countrys economy. It is imperative to overhaul this economic system for sustainable progress. We are still grappling with challenging times. In 2021, we faced shortages of essential goods, including medicine, fertilizer and fuel. Today, these necessities are available, with associated costs. The Cost of living is still felt by everyone. Economic development is crucial to alleviating these issues. While it is a wish that the economic damage of 2022 could be swiftly undone, the reality is that we need to transition to a new economy. To stimulate economic growth, we must focus on a competitive market, bolster exports, and increase foreign exchange reserves. An agreement with Thailand is set to be signed on February 3rd, marking an opportunity for collaboration. While Thailand shares a Theravada Buddhist heritage with Sri Lanka, our respective economic paths have diverged, leading to discernible differences today. Our actions today shape the future economy of our country. It necessitates thoughtful consideration and discussion. Political parties should engage in meaningful dialogue, especially when preparing for elections, understanding the intricacies of addressing the countrys challenges. It is imperative to carefully consider the future trajectory of our nations economy through open discussions. Political parties should engage in thorough deliberations, articulating strategic steps to address the challenges facing our country. Achieving solutions demands thoughtful discourse and a united commitment to charting a realistic economic path forward. Our emphasis should be on comprehensive discussions, steering away from impractical endeavourssymbolized by the metaphorical notion of bringing rice from the moon. Continuous evaluation and, when needed, adaptation of existing programs should be integral to our on-going conversation and collective dedication to progress. Our country has recently entered into an agreement with the International Monetary Fund, a pact signed by numerous countries, including 15-20 others. It is an agreement we cannot simply walk away from, necessitating collective discussion and consideration. However, the unfortunate reality is that our political landscape often resembles the fleeting nature of papadam put in the pan, enjoyed when it blooms, and soon forgotten. The cycle repeats, with new issues emerging, gaining momentary attention, and eventually fading into oblivion. We raised concerns on social media, vehemently opposing certain drafts, only to witness them become law despite public outcry. The Anti-Terrorism Act is now looming on the horizon, met with similar protests, yet risks being consigned to collective amnesia. Similarly, the introduction of the TRC Act sparked fears about the demise of free education, but these worries, too, eventually dissipated. This cyclical nature of political discourse has contributed to the challenges our country currently faces, a reality we must not lose sight of. We must have the strength to transcend our current predicament, recognizing that this decision impacts not only our own future but also that of our children. Hence, I urge all political party leaders in parliament to engage in discussions regarding our stance on the agreement with the IMF and whether any amendments are deemed necessary. Following these discussions, I am willing to extend an invitation to the Managing Director of the IMF to participate in a collective dialogue here. Let us collaboratively explore different perspectives and propose modifications if deemed beneficial. While the amendment process is open for consideration, it is imperative to acknowledge the existing agreement and work towards its implementation. --PMD",

        "date": "January 26, 2024 06:45 pm",
        "content": "The World Court ordered Israel on Friday to prevent acts of genocide against the Palestinians and do more to help civilians, although it stopped short of ordering a ceasefire as requested by South Africa. South Africa brought the case to the International Court of Justice (ICJ) earlier this month, asking it to grant emergency measures to halt the fighting, which has killed more than 26,000 Palestinians. It accused Israel of state-led genocide in its offensive, begun after Hamas militants stormed into Israel killing 1,200 and kidnapping more than 240. Israel sought to have the case thrown out. In Fridays ruling, the judges said Israel must take all measures within its power to prevent its troops from committing genocide, punish and must take steps to improve the humanitarian situation. While the ICJ did not order a ceasefire, it said it would not throw out the genocide case, ruling that the Palestinians appeared to be a protected group under the 1948 Genocide Convention. It did not decide the merits of the genocide allegations. Israel has called South Africas allegations false and grossly distorted, and said it makes the utmost efforts to avoid civilian casualties.
