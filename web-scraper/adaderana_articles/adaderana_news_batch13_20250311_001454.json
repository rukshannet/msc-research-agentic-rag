        "content": "Chile detected the first case of bird flu in a human, the countrys health ministry reported on Wednesday. The case was detected in a 53-year-old man who presented severe influenza symptoms, according to a statement issued by the ministry, but they noted the patient was in stable condition. The government is also investigating the source of contagion as well as others who were in contact with the patient. Chile has reported cases of the H5N1 bird flu since late last year in wild animals. Recent cases in industrial farms caused the government to halt poultry exports. Industrial cases have also been detected in Argentina, but Brazil, the worlds largest exporter of poultry, remains free of the contagion. Chilean health authorities noted the virus can be transmitted from birds or marine mammals to humans, but there is no known human-to-human transmission. Earlier this year, Ecuador confirmed its first case of human transmission of bird flu in a 9-year-old girl. Global health officials have said risk of transmission between humans is low, but vaccine makers have been preparing bird flu shots for humans just in case. Source - Reuters -Agencies",

        "date": "March 30, 2023 11:27 am",
        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe has stated that Sri Lankas ethnic issue cannot be divorced from the main economic issue it is currently facing. Delivering the keynote address at the Economic Dialogue  IMF and Beyond held at the Galle Face Hotel in Colombo this morning (30 March), the Head of State said that the prevalent ethnic issue in the country cannot be separated from the economic crisis, and must be resolved if the island nation is to progress. Sri Lanka has a final opportunity to progress and it is imperative for everyone to collaborate in creating a prosperous community for future generations, without resorting to finger-pointing, emphasized President Ranil Wickremesinghe. At the CEO Forum hosted by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka, President Ranil Wickremesinghe expressed that the Government should surpass the IMF program and concentrate on establishing a thriving community for upcoming generations, emphasizing the Governments dedication to this goal. President Ranil Wickremesinghe reflected on Sri Lankas past missed opportunities for development, specifically highlighting the failure to implement Mr. D.S. Senanayakes proposals and the Shenoy Report of 1965. He further added that the countrys progress was hindered by the ethnic issue of 1978, which impeded the chance to rebuild the countrys foundation for development. He said that the ethnic issue cannot be separated from the economic issue and if the country is to prosper, this issue must be resolved. President Ranil Wickremesinghe highlighted Sri Lankas potential for a green economy and stressed the urgency for the country to embark on digitalization. He further emphasized that funding should be directed towards education, health, and social security for marginalized and underprivileged groups, rather than being spent on entities such as the Sri Lanka Petroleum Corporation, Sri Lankan Airlines, and the Ceylon Electricity Board, which have already drained a significant amount of the countrys resources. Minister of Foreign Affairs Ali Sabry, Minister of Power and Energy Kanchana Wijesekera, Minister of State for Finance Ranjith Siyambalapitiya, Minister of State for Investment Promotion Dilum Amunugama, Members of Parliament Eran Wickramaratne, M.A. Sumanthiran, Dr. Harsha de Silva, Senior Advisor to the President on National Security and Chief of Staff to the President Sagala Ratnayake, Presidents Senior Adviser on Climate Change Ruwan Wijayawardena, Presidents Economic Adviser Dr. R.H.S. Samaratunga, Economic Advisor to the Ministry of Finance Deshal De Mel, Finance Ministry Secretary Dr. Mahinda Siriwardena, Central Bank Governor Dr. Nandalal Weerasinghe, and others attended the event. The Panel discussion was moderated by Attorney at law Mohamed Adamaly and Ceylon Chamber of Commerce Chairman Vish Govindasamy, Chairman of Joint Apparel Association Forum Sri Lanka (JAAFSL) Sharad Amalean, BASL representative Attorney at law Harsha Fernando, Sri Lanka Association for Software Services Companies (SLASSCOM) Chairman Ashique M.Ali , Chartered Institute of Personnel Management Sri Lanka (CIPM) Chairman Ken Vijayakumar, President of Sri Lanka Institute of Marketing (SLIM) Nuwan Gamage, The Womens Chamber of Industry and Commerce (WCIC) Chairperson Anoji De Silva, President of Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka (CA Sri Lanka) Sanjaya Bandara, The Sri Lanka Institute of Directors Chairman Faizal Salieh participated in the Panel as members representing Professional Bodies and Chambers. Following is the keynote address delivered by President Ranil Wickremesinghe; Honourable Minister, member of the Parliament, President of the Chartered Institute, distinguished guests and friends. Minister Ranjith Siyambalapitiya gave a good description of the economic problems we face today. Therefore, I will not cover that ground again. Today, we are having the first discussion after the announcement of the IMF program. Its being held in a hotel, which is a symbol of our first commercial economy; the plantation economy. The British are the ones who carried the transformation from a feudal economy to a commercial economy. The first ventures in coffee collapsed. And then came the big transformation of tea, rubber, coconut and the development of the other industries services and the Colombo port. And this is a symbol of how people would come here and discuss issues of firstly the British and later on, the Sri Lankans. So that generation in 50 years created a new economy. Now, after independence, the task has come on us to continue that work. We have done so well that today our poverty line, people living below poverty has increased from 12.5 to 25 of the population. There are people who skip one meal. There are 500,000 who have lost their jobs. Many small and medium enterprises are on the verge of collapse. What happened? Whos responsible? All of us are responsible for the situation we are in today. We must remember that. Whether we are the politicians, whether we are the business community, whether we are the professionals, whether we are the trade unions, whether we are the civil society and more than others, whether we are the media or we are the Government administrators, we cannot run away from that responsibility. We must all bear that. If you still continue pointing fingers at each other, we will not succeed. But what matters to us is not merely the IMF program, but also what comes beyond that. What we have to do now is to ensure that the next generation will live in a prosperous society. Thats all that the Government is seeking to do. The start is difficult, as the minister explained, but nevertheless we have to go along. We cannot by any mean move away from it. Our task is not merely to stabilize the economy, but to ensure growth, to grow in this new global economy, and to go ahead. These are facts that we cant get away from. If we are to do this, we must remember that one of the biggest issues that held back our growth is the ethnic issue. We have to think as Sri Lankans. We cannot divorce that issue from the economic issues. There are two Es as far as I can see. And we have to address both those issues. I am not dealing with that issue now. This is not the time or the place. But nevertheless, we have to decide. We have to acknowledge. Secondly, how do we carry on our discussions at this crucial moment? We are a democratic country. Open debate is useful and its good that we have members representing Government and opposition, the business community and the professions. But we have to discuss and debate these issues and the discussion must take place in the halls of discussion from Parliament downwards, not in the streets. That type of agitation is no longer suitable for a country that goes on to development. But the decision is ours to take, not for the Government to enforce. We can only ensure law and order, but otherwise, where do we hold our discussions? Thats the second issue. So from here, we have to go forward. I will not deal with the details of the IMF package. As you all are aware, in addition to what the honourable state minister said, there are also other important objectives. It will bring about a significant revenue base, fiscal adjustment based on progressive tax reforms to raise Sri Lankas revenue to GDP ratio. It is a progressive one so that we gradually reduce the tax burden on the poor, who has to bear the brunt of the VAT system. Better public expenditure and debt management through essential institutional reforms and enhanced social safety net to cushion the poor. Restoring price stability and a market determined flexible exchange rate, and rebuilding our international reserves. Then, ensuring financial stability through a healthy banking system. Now, these are some of the key objectives of this IMF reform, in addition to what the minister has mentioned. Therefore, what we are seeking is to stabilize the economy by 2026, and come back to virtually the same ratios we had in 2019. So we have seven years to come back to 2019. Is that enough? That is the issue. Anyway, approval of this program will allow Sri Lanka to commence negotiations with private and official creditors on restructuring its debt, in line with the parameters set by the IMF debt sustainable assessment and also the commitments that I have made with my letter of March 14. We hope to conclude the discussions and arrive at a comprehensive restructuring agreement with the creditors. By the time the first review under the EFF in six months takes place in order to keep its part a bargain with the creditors and fully benefit from the debt restructuring, Sri Lanka will need to implement the commitment under this four years economic program. So we still have to start the debt restructuring, especially the discussions with our private creditors. From here, do we stop at this stage and do the debt restructuring and the four-year program? That is not enough. If you want to give a future to your children, if you want a future of the youth, then we have to go forward because Sri Lanka is today at the crossroads between seizing the opportunity for growth to fix our long-standing institutions and structural problems to become a prosperous society, or denying our problems, rejecting change and stagnating as a lower middle-income country. Implementing this program is how we seize the opportunity for a more prosperous future. The dissatisfaction with all our systems, with the Government, with the opposition, with the conventional groups, resulted in last year March of young people marching on to Galle Face Green; The start of the Aragalaya. Unfortunately, it was taken over by violent extremists. Then what have the young people done now? They are voting with their feet and leaving the country. So this is what we have to think, not to study the IMF program and decide whether we are going to support item one, we are not support item two, how are we going to stabilize the industry or, create growth and become a prosperous society? So this is what is most important than IMF. In addition to stabilization, is the growth enhancing structural reforms. If we dont do these structural reforms, you can write it out and next time is going to be a far more violent uprising. And we must boldly go ahead with these structural reforms which will unlock our growth potential, put on a high growth trajectory, thats the only way out. So we have to reduce the role of the Government in the economy to increase efficient resource allocation, competition and productivity. We must not look at the Government to bail everything out. We cannot look at the Government as the ultimate provider of solutions to issues that cannot be resolved by the market. Then further trade liberalization, including rationalizing remaining Para tariffs. The world global economy is going to be more competitive, we have to adjust to it. The labour market reforms will enable more females to join the labour force. As our population age, it is necessary that more females join the labour force. Remove the impediments to private investment, including by modernizing the regulatory and doing business environment. Reduce electricity costs by improving the generation and the mix and distribution of power generation leading to an efficient electrical distribution network. Addressing Climate Change, we have to go through this. There is no way out. If anyone has another system, let them get up and say so. And what I am aiming in the next two years is to lay the groundwork for a highly competitive social market economy. We have to be competitive. So wed like to upgrade our FTA with India to Economic and Technical Cooperation Agreement and join the RCEP, the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership. I dont think we should hesitate. If Laos can join and Cambodia can join and Myanmar can join, why cant we join? Thats the issue. That means we are going to compete. A quite high level of competition means an efficient Government structure. And why do I say to social market economy? But we need more money. We can talk our education system covering 90 of the students having 10,000 schools. But what is the quality of education? We need money to make it one of the best education systems in South Asia or the best education in South Asia in the next decade. That is social progress. Secondly, the health system. We spend a lot of money on health, but do we get the benefit of every rupee we spend? We need to put more money into the social safety network, to the poor, to the vulnerable. We have to help them. So that we have to get the bulk of our money in to it and not to support the Petroleum Corporation or the CEB or Sri Lankan. And we wasted too much of our resources on those occasions. So let us look at how we go ahead. Our potential for green economy at the moment is good, not only renewable energy, but green hydrogen, green ammonia and many other outputs resulting from this green energy, especially the biomass which we have not thought of and wave energy. We should get into it immediately, like we got into the apparels as soon as the 1978 reform started. Start the digitalization. Start with the Western Province where 50 of the economy is and spread out to the other areas of high economic activity, then cover the rest of the country. We have to look at tourism one which will get us average of 500-1000 a night. We can start off with the low hanging fruit, and another low hanging fruit is agriculture, where productivity is small. Let us modernize agriculture and fisheries. Thats the start of another low hanging fruit. As far as manufacturing and industries is concerned, lets not get there step by step. Then, Government money must go to establish the infrastructure for such industries and services. These are some that I can think of but youll can think of more. Sri Lanka becoming a regional logistic centre, the offshore potential for the offshore economy, all these are matters to be discussed. So we must take this chance. We cant wait. Weve been missing out on all the opportunities for restructuring. When we became independent, Mr. D.S. Senanayake said lets be independent, cultivate and let us aim to be self-sufficient in rice. When we saved that foreign exchange, well be much better off. He also called Sir John Kotelawala to start the hydroelectricity systems. Then the first round of reforms after that was not introduced by the UNP. The most significant one was Mr. Philip Gunawardenas Paddy Land Act. It was not a communist measure; the Americans had carried out massive land reform pertaining to paddy land in Japan, in South Korea and Taiwan. He just adapted that and it led to the, actually the growth of production in those countries. So he brought that in together with the Agrarian Services Department, and the Government had to establish the Peoples Bank. It was shot down not by the opposition. It was shot down from within the Government. And you have this watered down act, which is there today. So we missed the first chance of building upon what Mr. D.S. Senanayake had done. The second chance came again in 1965 with Mr. Dudly Senanayakes report and the Shenoy report. The starting of industry, the Industrial Development Board, education reforms, increasing productivity and tourism. Some of these were implemented, but the Shenoy report was not implemented, and as a result, we lost the next opportunity. If we had gone ahead with those reforms, it was similar to what Park Chung-hee brought in South Korea and Lee Kuan Yew brought into Singapore. The third round came in 1978. J.R. Jayawardena opened up the economy and went ahead, but we had to slow down because of the ethnic situation and the conflict that broke out in the country. Nevertheless, in 1989, the second stage was done by President Premadasa and when we pushed ahead, firstly to divest ourselves on some of those corporations which are doing quite well, like Kelani Tyres and as well as the push for investments both in the apparel sector as well as the tourist sector and a lot of other new industries which we started. But then that came to an end after 1994 as a next Government focused completely on resolving the ethnic issue at the expense of the economic development. It went on. So we missed that opportunity. Those who were behind us, got ahead of us. Then came regaining Sri Lanka. We missed that. So how many more opportunities are we going to get? We havent got any, this is the last chance. Are we going to take it or not? Thats all that you to decide here. The details you can work out. We have a six month review, another six month review. But what is in the IMF program, we have to go ahead with. But on what we are doing on the growth program, yes, we can discuss that further. And once the debate and the IMF program is over and the resolution is put to vote, thereafter we put out a sketch or a white paper on how the growth should take place, and I would like the National Council of Parliament to be engaged with the Government and for all of us to engage the rest of the sectors of society in determining what our future is going to be. So all I request of you is to make up your mind that we are going to grow and this is the last chance and lets press the accelerator to the floor. There is nothing else that we can do and I ask all of you to join the Government in this task we have undertaken. Thank you very much. And thank you for the Chartered Association for sponsoring this event. Minister of State for Finance Mr. Ranjith Siyambalapitiya, delivering the guest speech said: We experienced a dual deficit for a period of time, which some took action to address. At times, this issue was overlooked as the gap between Government revenue and spending persisted, and non-interest Government spending continued to increase over time. This created a balance of payments issue, and large infrastructure developments were undertaken through loans that did not yield dollar earnings when needed. Additionally, the country faced unexpected challenges such as the Easter attack and COVID-19, which caused the country to shut down for days and led to the collapse of the tourism industry following the Easter attack. The fertilizer policy caused a major conflict, but by 2022, the gross domestic product had reached 8.2. We resorted to taking out another loan to manage our debt stock. Rating companies consistently reminded us of our global standing. We allocated 20 percent, but we needed to find 12 percent, and we did not have the funds locally or internationally. Our country experienced severe shortages of goods, resulting in long queues and public unrest. Our reserves reached negative values, and the Central Bank was forced to decide not to pay creditors. We turned to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), with whom we have had 16 dealings. While we previously went to them as needed, we agreed to restructure debt with bilateral creditors. The public celebrated this victory, despite the many unique challenges we continue to face. Unfortunately, most previous agreements with the International Monetary Fund could not be maintained, and difficult decisions had to be made. Currently, we face a new challenge where international organizations are scrutinizing us more than usual. Along with our regular duties, we must also control inflation. Our food inflation has risen to over 90 percent, causing great distress to the public. We cannot distribute or import goods to help alleviate this issue. One of the tough decisions we made was to raise bank interest rates, which was difficult for everyone. However, thanks to the extreme measures taken by the Central Bank, inflation is now returning to normal. We need to increase our direct taxes to recover what we have lost. Despite our efforts, there is still a significant loss of income, either subtly taken from us or lost due to various reasons. We are currently engaged in a national exercise, and its success is crucial for us. The Electricity Board previously functioned as a social welfare agency, so increasing electricity bills is an unpopular decision. Social security should be provided to those in need, but the selection process must be done carefully by responsible officers. Officials often avoid taking on this responsibility. Work-related issues can also arise despite our progress. It is necessary to make the Central Bank independent, and a bill to this effect has been introduced to Parliament. Additionally, a robust anti-corruption bill is also being proposed. To effectively address the needs of the people, loss-making public institutions must be restructured. The Governments move towards divesting from businesses is a positive step that must be done transparently. However, society may have a different perception, and it is important to explain the true situation to the people. These actions should be taken to help reduce the daily expenses of the common people. Chartered Accountants are highly skilled financial managers and possess great talents and responsibilities. Their commitment and support are crucial in building the country, as they generate income from the main institutions. It is essential to view these developments positively and in good faith.",

        "content": "The Supreme Court has fixed two petitions, filed against Finance Ministry Secretary Mahinda Siriwardana, for consideration on May 22. The two contempt of court petitions were called before a five-member Supreme Court bench today (March 30). Justices Buwaneka Aluwihare, Priyantha Jayawardena, Vijith Malalgoda and Murdu Fernando were on the bench, chaired by Chief Justice Jayantha Jayasuriya. Presenting submissions, the Attorney General sought more time to arrange the documents pertaining to this legal matter. Granting leave for the request, the judge bench decided to fix the two petitions for consideration on May 22. The petitions had been filed by Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) general secretary Ranjith Madduma Bandara and National Peoples Power (NPP) MP Vijitha Herath. They alleged that the Finance Secretary failed to comply with the Supreme Courts interim order, issued earlier this month, preventing him from withholding the budgetary allocations for the 2023 Local Government election. The election, which was repeatedly postponed citing inadequacy of funds due to the ongoing economic crisis, has been rescheduled for April 25.",

        "content": "Former Election Commission Chairman Mahinda Deshapriya has deemed the postponement of the Local Government (LG) election a crime which affects the countrys democracy. Speaking on the 2023 LG polls, Deshapriya stated that the postponement of the LG polls should not be justified under any circumstances, adding that it was a sorrowful situation that no country should face. Deshapriya said he expects that the election will have taken place at least by World Youth Day in August, or on the International Day of Democracy in September. The problem being faced now is how this issue can be resolved. However the answer to this lies with the Election Commission, the Finance Ministry and the Treasury. Neither the media, us nor the public have the answers to this problem, he said. The former Chairman further noted that the postponement posed a threat to democracy, stating that if there is no election, this implies that there is no democracy. Democracy is inclusive of several factors, including economic freedom, cultural freedom, religious freedom and other fundamental rights. In fact, if there is no election, there is no democracy.",

        "content": "Sri Lanka and India have mulled over the ways and means to enhance bilateral trade, particularly through Indian Rupee trade expansion, as a key pillar of the island nations economic revival. This was taken up for discussion when the High Commissioner of Sri Lanka to India, Milinda Moragoda called on the Governor of Reserve Bank of India (RBI), Shri Shaktikanta Das on Wednesday (March 29). The meeting took place at the RBIs headquarters in Mumbai during the Sri Lankan envoys official visit to the State of Maharashtra as part of his continued engagement with key officials of the Indian government. The meeting between the RBI governor and the Sri Lankan high commissioner was held in a very cordial manner, and a range of issues pertaining to the bilateral economic cooperation was discussed. Moragoda thanked RBI governor for the support that India has been extending to Sri Lanka in the context of economic stabilization, particularly the currency swap arrangements and deferment of payments that materialized with the direct involvement of the Reserve Bank of India. He also thanked India for stepping up to help the realization of the International Monetary Funds Extended Fund Facility (EFF) for Sri Lanka. The RBI governor and the Sri Lankan high commissioner discussed economic recovery in Sri Lanka, and the pivotal role that India could play in it through greater integration of the economies in areas such as power, energy, ports, infrastructure, tourism and IT services. Moragoda presented a copy of his policy roadmap the Integrated Country Strategy for Sri Lanka Diplomatic Missions in India 20212023 to Governor Das. The high commissioner was accompanied to the meeting by Sri Lankas Consul General in Mumbai Dr. Valsan Vethody. A former Indian Administrative Service (IAS) officer, Shaktikanta Das has been serving as the 25th Governor of the Reserve Bank of India since December 2018. He was earlier a member of the Fifteenth Finance Commission and Indias Sherpa to the G20. During his career as an IAS officer, Das served in various capacities for the Indian Government, including as Economic Affairs Secretary, Revenue Secretary and Fertilizers Secretary. He has also served as Indias Alternate Governor in the World Bank, ADB, NDB and AIIB. Over the past couple of months, Sri Lankan High Commissioner Moragoda met with several other key officials of the Government of India, including Principal Secretary to the Prime Minister of India Dr. Pramod Kumar Mishra, Finance Secretary T.V.

        "date": "March 30, 2023 03:05 pm",
        "content": "At least 28 people have been killed and 230 rescued after a passenger ferry caught fire in the Philippines. The blaze began in the ships air-conditioned cabins on Wednesday night but it is unclear how, officials said. Among the dead were at least three children, including a six-month-old baby. Earlier, officials said the number of people missing was uncertain because an exact passenger count was not known. Just 205 were listed on a manifest. The Philippine Coast Guard said search and rescue operations were ongoing and there were no signs of overloading on the ship. The initial death toll amounted to less than a dozen people - these were thought to have drowned as they jumped into the water without life jackets. However authorities then discovered another 18 bodies on the vessel that were totally burnt, said Commodore Rejard Marfe of the Coast Guard. He added that chaos resulted when the fire broke out, as most of the passengers were sleeping at the time. The captain eventually ran the vessel aground so that it would be easier for those onboard to swim to shore. Authorities said earlier that 14 people were injured and another seven missing. The MV Lady Mary Joy 3 caught fire around 22:40 local time (14:40 GMT) off Baluk-baluk island in Basilan province. It had been travelling to another island. Mayor Arsina Kahing-Nanoh told CNN Philippines that one of the rescued passengers said an explosion could be heard before the blaze broke out. She added that more explosions were heard as the ship ran aground. The coast guard said it would assist with an investigation and safety assessment, and check for oil spills. The Philippines, an archipelago of more than 7,600 islands, has a poor maritime safety record. Vessels are often overcrowded, with many ageing ships still in use. Last May, at least seven people died after a fire in a high-speed ferry carrying 134 people. In 1987, around 5,000 people perished in the worlds worst peacetime shipping disaster, when an overloaded passenger ferry collided with an oil tanker off Mindoro island. Source  BBC -Agencies",

        "date": "March 30, 2023 03:16 pm",
        "content": "Minister of Sports and Youth Affairs Roshan Ranasinghe has written to the Chairman of the International Cricket Council (ICC), Greg Barclay, pertaining to recent media reports claiming that a committee has been appointed to investigate Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC). Issuing a release in this regard, the Ministry noted that Ranasinghe had written to Barclay, requesting a discussion on media reports claiming that the ICC has appointed a three-member committee to investigate into the alleged political interferences within SLC. The statement further noted that in his letter, the Minister assured that he shared the same ideals as the ICC on the fact that the SLC should remain independent, adding that other registered national sports bodies too, should be devoid of political interferences. Moreover, Minster Ranasinghe stated that it is essential that all sports teams and organizations within the country act in accordance with a certain standard, in light of the fact that they are also subjected to the conditions and regulations of international organizations. Indian media recently reported that the ICC has appointed a three-member committee to assess the alleged political interference in the functioning of SLC. The high profile committee reportedly includes  Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) secretary Jay Shah, ICC Deputy Chairman Imran Khawaja and Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) president Nazmul Hassan, Cricket Age reported. The committee is tasked to comprehensively looking at the matter and submit the report to the games governing body, a well-placed ICC source told Cricket Age. The development comes days after SLCs top Officials  President Shammi Silva, CEO Ashley de Silva, Secretary Mohan de Silva and Vice President Domestic Cricket Ravin Wickramaratne visited Dubai to attend the ICC meeting. The debate  over political interference in the functioning of the Cricket Board in Sri Lanka  started right after Roshan Ranasinghe was sworn in as the islands Sports Minister last year. It reached the boiling point, when Ranasinghe issued a series of regulations on December 14, with regard to the matters including the tenure of Sports Associations, holding elections, term of office of the positions held in sports associations and age limitations. In response, SLC went to the Court of Appeal and managed to get an interim order preventing the implementation of the gazette notification, until the hearing of the writ petition filed by the Cricket Board and several sports associations is concluded. Since then, the Minister and SLCs top officials are at loggerheads. Interestingly, several other Sport Bodies have also voiced their concern against Ranasinghes gazette notification, especially after football and rugby were banned by its global governing bodies respectively.

        "date": "March 30, 2023 03:57 pm",
        "content": "China and Brazil have reached a deal to trade in their own currencies, ditching the US dollar as an intermediary, the Brazilian government said on Wednesday, Beijings latest salvo against the almighty greenback. The deal will enable China, the top rival to US economic hegemony, and Brazil, the biggest economy in Latin America, to conduct their massive trade and financial transactions directly, exchanging yuan for reais and vice versa instead of going through the dollar. The expectation is that this will reduce costs... promote even greater bilateral trade and facilitate investment, the Brazilian Trade and Investment Promotion Agency (ApexBrasil) said in a statement. China is Brazils biggest trading partner, with a record US150.5 billion (S200 billion) in bilateral trade last year. The deal, which follows a preliminary agreement in January, was announced after a high-level China-Brazil business forum in Beijing. Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva was originally scheduled to attend the forum as part of a high-profile China visit, but had to postpone his trip indefinitely on Sunday after he came down with pneumonia. The Industrial and Commercial Bank of China and Bank of Communications BBM will execute the transactions, officials said. China has similar currency deals with Russia, Pakistan and several other countries. Source - AFP - Agencies",

        "title": "Ensure fair taxes, accountability for corruption: HRW tells Sri Lankan govt",
        "date": "March 30, 2023 04:13 pm",
        "content": "The Human Rights Watch (HRW) has urged the Sri Lankan government to ensure that policies implemented to enhance revenues do not further erode economic and social rights and that anti-corruption reforms provide accountability. Expressing skepticism about the USD 3 billion bailout package recently approved by the International Monetary Fund to help Sri Lanka resolve the economic crisis, the HRW said this program has structured risks further undermining the peoples economic and social rights. Meenakshi Ganguly, South Asia director of HRW, stressed that the Sri Lankans who are struggling to make ends meet should not have to carry the burden as the economic crisis was a result of the official corruption and tax rules that benefitted the wealthiest in the country. The government should recognize that the public deserves real accountability, whether its for past war crimes or ongoing misgovernance and repression of critics. The executive board of the IMF approved the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) of USD 3 billion (SDR 2.286 billion) to Sri Lanka at its board meeting held March 20, allowing allow Sri Lanka to access financing of up to USD 7 billion from the IMF, international financial institutions and multilateral organizations. Soon after receiving the approval, Sri Lanka received the first tranche of the IMF-supported 48-month extended arrangement under the EFF program which amounted to USD 333 million (close to SDR 254 million). The human rights body called on the international financial institutions including the World Bank and Asian Development Bank (ADB) and donors to insist on transparent, rights-respecting governance in the country. The HRW, pointing out that the IMF loan is intended to provide the island nation with a lifeline while addressing deep-rooted problems that led to the crisis situation, noted that under international law, governments and financial institutions have an obligation to respond to economic crises in a way that advances rather than further jeopardizes human rights, and should avoid pursuing policies that reduce low-income peoples access to essential goods and services. The IMF programs focus on increasing government revenues, rather than reducing public spending as a percentage of Gross Domestic Product (GDP), will better protect rights, the HRW said, adding that while some of the new measures are designed to increase taxes on the wealthy and eliminate tax exemptions that benefit them, the heavy reliance on value-added taxes can worsen the cost-of-living crisis. The government has already increased corporate tax rates and removed all sector-specific tax exemptions, according to the IMF staff report. But most new tax revenue will come from value-added taxes (VAT), which were raised from 8 to 12 percent in May 2022 and again to 15 percent in September. Basic food items remain exempt from VAT, but the government committed to VAT reform by 2024 that would remove almost all product-specific exemptions. While the wealthy pay more VAT in absolute terms because they spend more, the expense makes up a much greater share of income for low-income people, HRW statement read further. In 2019, the amount of revenue that came from VAT and income taxes were on par, but by the end of the program, VAT is expected to make up 32 percent of all taxes, whereas income taxes would make up 21 percent. The program reduces the threshold for taxing annual income to Rs. 1.2 million (USD 3,694), a change that some have protested as burdening families who are already struggling to realize their rights. The HRW went on to urge the government to publish data on the percentage of the population that is subject to income taxes under this change and to consider advancing the introduction of taxes on property, gifts, and inheritance, which the program mandates by 2025. The HRW also noted that the IMF program includes other measures that could harm low-income people: Calling for keeping any increase in public wages to less than inflation, effectively reducing real salaries and reducing total spending on wages from 5 to 3.6 percent of GDP; eliminating subsidies for both fuel and electricity; imposing an excise tax on fuel. However, the program does not ensure that these critical measures are carried out in a way that fulfills rather than erodes rights. To protect rights when removing subsidies and introducing taxes for fossil fuels, the government should adequately invest in social protection, the use of renewable energy sources, and other measures to move toward a rights-aligned economy, HRW said. The program includes a so-called social spending floor that would gradually raise spending on four cash transfer programs to help cushion the potential impact of macroeconomic adjustment on the poor and vulnerable groups. While the floor brings up total spending on these programs to 0.6 percent of GDP, it is set at far less than developing countries average spending on safety nets, which is 1.6 percent. The HRW further raised concerns about the insistence on targeting benefits based on eligibility criteria which also risks continuing to exclude people who are unable to access goods and services essential for an adequate standard of living. The details of the new eligibility criteria and electronic registry have not been made public, but research has shown pervasive problems with targeting benefits, including high error and exclusion rates. Speaking on the matter, HRWs South Asia director said it is not the time to experiment with fixing chronic and pervasive problems with targeted cash transfer programs at a time when half of Sri Lankan families are buying food on credit. Instead of investing precious funds in new registries, the governments focus should be on building a tax system that makes sure the wealthy pay their fair share, Meenakshi Ganguly said further.",

        "date": "March 30, 2023 04:28 pm",
        "content": "Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment (SLBFE) has decided to suspend the admission of women, who have expatriated without registering with the SLBFE and arrive at Sri Lankan embassies due to issues at their workplaces, to the Suraksha safe houses. Issuing a statement, the Foreign Employment Bureau states that the decision will come into effect from April 01, 2023. The Suraksha safe houses have been established under the Labour Welfare Divisions of Sri Lankan embassies overseas in order to provide shelter and welfare facilities to Sri Lankan women, who have expatriated after registering with the SLBFE and arrive at the embassies to obtain different services they need. Those safe houses have been established only for women who have lawfully migrated for employment, the SLBFE said. Nevertheless, the Foreign Employment Bureau has also provided all necessary welfare facilities to women who have gone abroad without registering with the bureau, it added. There have been media reports of certain instances where women who have not migrated after registering with the SLBFE have created conflicting situations when they arrive at Suraksha safe houses, while at certain instances the assistance of the police have also been sought to control such situations. Accordingly, the Foreign Employment Bureau has decided to suspend the admission of women who have been expatriated without being registered with the SLBFE for employment through various unlawful means, to the Suraksha safe houses. The decision has been reached as a measure to encourage women to migrate for employment via legal means, and to encourage them to refrain from seeking foreign employment through the involvement of various brokers and unlawful foreign employment agencies, the SLBFE emphasized.",

The stock of narcotics was seized during a foot patrol conducted in the beach area of Madagal, Jaffna on 28 March. Accordingly, naval personnel recovered eight suspicious sacks left behind at the beach, which were stuffed with 71 packages of Kerala cannabis weighing about 150kg and 390g. Meanwhile, a special search operation conducted off Madagal on the same day led to the apprehension of a suspicious sack adrift in the seas of Madagal. The retrieved sack contained seven parcels stuffed with about 15kg and 05g of Kerala cannabis. It is suspected that smugglers may have abandoned the stock of cannabis due to constant naval operations, the Sri Lanka Navy reported. The gross value of the seized narcotics, which is currently in naval custody until it is handed over to the relevant authorities for onward legal action, is believed to be over Rs. 54 million.",

        "date": "March 30, 2023 10:08 pm",
        "content": "Nine soldiers were killed in a crash of two medical evacuation Black Hawk helicopters during a routine nighttime training mission over Kentucky, the U.S. Army said on Thursday, in one of the militarys deadliest training accidents in recent years. Crew members using night-vision goggles were flying two HH-60 Black Hawk helicopters, operated by the Armys 101st Airborne Division, when the aircraft crashed in a field late on Wednesday over Kentuckys Trigg County. Army Brigadier General John Lubas, the divisions deputy commanding officer for operations, said little was known so far about why the helicopters came down and he acknowledged he was not even sure whether they crashed into each other. Lubas said an aircraft safety investigations team from Fort Rucker in Alabama would arrive later on Thursday to review data from onboard computers, which he said were similar to the black boxes in commercial aircraft. At this point, we dont know. Were hopeful that when we get the team from Fort Rucker here and theyre able to pull some of the data out of the onboard computers we will have a better understanding of exactly what happened, Lubas told reporters outside the base. Lubas added that one helicopter had five soldiers aboard while the other had four, and they were using night-vision goggles. The HH-60 is a variant of the Black Hawk helicopter designed to provide support for various military operations, including air assaults and medical evacuations, according to the Army. Army Secretary Christine Wormuth addressed a Senate committee, where lawmakers expressed their condolences, and said it was tough moment for the U.S. militarys biggest service branch. Thank you for your comments and thoughts and prayers for the families of our soldiers who were killed in the crash. Our hearts go out to them, Wormuth told the Senate Armed Services Committee. Its a heavy day for the Army. The weather in Fort Campbell area, which straddles the border between Kentucky and Tennessee, featured clear skies and calm winds on Wednesday night, according to National Weather Service forecaster Marc Chenard. Fort Campbell, home to the 101st Airborne Division, is one of the largest military bases in the United States.

        "title": "Donald Trump criminally charged in New York, a first for a US ex-president",
        "date": "March 31, 2023 08:19 am",
        "content": "(Reuters) - Donald Trump has been indicted by a Manhattan grand jury after a probe into hush money paid to porn star Stormy Daniels, becoming the first former U.S. president to face criminal charges even as he makes another run for the White House. The charges from an investigation led by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg come as Trump seeks the Republican nomination to run again in 2024. The specific charges are not yet known, as the indictment remains under seal. CNN reported Trump faces more than 30 counts related to business fraud. Trump said he was completely innocent and indicated he would not drop out of the race. He accused Bragg, a Democrat, of trying to hurt his chances of winning re-election. This is Political Persecution and Election Interference at the highest level in history, he said in a statement. Shortly after, Trump appealed to supporters to provide money for a legal defense. He has raised over 2 million, according to his campaign, since he incorrectly predicted on March 18 that he would be arrested four days later. The charges will likely be unsealed by a judge in the coming days. Trump will have to travel to Manhattan for fingerprinting and other processing at that point. Braggs office said it had contacted Trumps attorney to coordinate a surrender, which a court official said would likely occur next Tuesday. Trumps lawyers Susan Necheles and Joseph Tacopina said they will vigorously fight the charges. The Manhattan investigation is one of several legal challenges facing Trump. Bragg successfully prosecuted Trumps business last year on tax-fraud charges, leading to a 1.61 million criminal penalty. The presiding judge in that case, New York Supreme Court Justice Juan Merchan, is expected to oversee this case as well, according to a person familiar with the matter. The charges could hurt Trumps presidential comeback attempt, as the mug shot from his arraignment and any visuals from his courtroom appearances could provide fodder for rivals. Trump could use the case to stoke anger among his core supporters, though other Republican voters might tire of the drama. Some 44 of Republicans said he should drop out of the race if he is indicted, according to a ReutersIpsos poll released last week. Trumps allies and fellow Republicans blasted the indictment as politically motivated, while Democrats said he is not immune from the rule of law. Even potential presidential rivals voiced support for Trump. This will only serve to divide our country, Trumps former vice president Mike Pence said on CNN. The White House declined to comment. Outside the courthouse, several protesters silently held signs criticizing Trump. Authorities bolstered security around the courthouse after Trump called for nationwide protests on March 18, recalling his charged rhetoric ahead of the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol. HUSH MONEY Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, has said she received money in exchange for keeping silent about a sexual encounter she had with Trump in 2006. The former presidents personal lawyer Michael Cohen has said he coordinated with Trump on the payments to Daniels and to a second woman, former Playboy model Karen McDougal, who also said she had a sexual relationship with him. Trump has denied having affairs with either woman. Trump in 2018 initially disputed knowing anything about the payment to Daniels. He later acknowledged reimbursing Cohen for the payment, which he called a simple private transaction. No one is above the law, Daniels lawyer Clark Brewster said on Twitter. Cohen pleaded guilty to a campaign-finance violation in 2018 and served more than a year in prison. Federal prosecutors said he acted at Trumps direction. Cohen said he stood by his testimony and the evidence he provided to prosecutors. Accountability matters, he said in a statement. No former or sitting U.S. president has ever faced criminal charges. Aside from this case, Trump faces two criminal investigations by a special counsel appointed by U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland and another criminal probe by a local prosecutor in Georgia. Trump has escaped legal peril numerous times. In the White House, he weathered two attempts by Congress to remove him from office, including for the Jan. 6, assault on the U.S. Capitol by his supporters, as well as a years-long probe into his campaigns contacts with Russia in 2016. In last years tax-fraud case, Bragg targeted Trumps business but declined to charge Trump himself with financial crimes, prompting two prosecutors who worked on the probe to resign. In the hush-money case, legal experts say that Bragg might have to rely on untested legal theories to argue Trump falsified business records to cover up other crimes, such as violating federal campaign-finance law. Trump leads his early rivals for his partys nomination, holding the support of 44 of Republicans in a March ReutersIpsos poll, compared with 30 support for his nearest rival, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, who has yet to announce his candidacy. President Joe Biden is expected to seek re-election. Source: Reuters -Agencies",

        "title": "Gwyneth Paltrow awarded 1 and cleared of fault over ski crash",
        "date": "March 31, 2023 11:01 am",
        "content": "A jury has found US actress Gwyneth Paltrow was not at fault for a 2016 ski crash at a resort in Utah. Retired optometrist Terry Sanderson, 76, had said Ms Paltrow crashed into him, leaving him with life-changing injuries. He sought 300,000 (245,000) in damages. Ms Paltrow, 50, blamed him for the accident, countersuing for 1 plus legal fees. Listening to the verdict in court, Ms Paltrow was expressionless, staring straight ahead and appearing to nod slightly. She then left the courtroom, declining requests for comments. On her way out, she briefly stopped to speak to Mr Sanderson. He later said she told him: I wish you well. Contradictory stories Speaking to media outside, her lawyer Steve Owens said Ms Paltrow has a history of advocating for what she believes in. This situation was no different and she will continue to stand up for what is right, he said. Afterwards Mr Sanderson called the verdict very disappointing and maintained he had been the one hit on the slope. The two-week trial heard from dozens of witnesses with contradictory stories about who crashed in to whom. After three hours of deliberation, a jury unanimously found Mr Sanderson entirely at fault for the incident, and awarded Ms Paltrow 1. In Mr Sandersons telling, the Oscar winner slammed in to him on a beginner slope at Deer Valley Resort in Park City. Ms Paltrow then skied away while he remained unconscious in the snow with broken ribs, Mr Sanderson said. The accident left him with life-altering brain trauma, he testified. On the stand, Ms Paltrow offered an entirely different account of the accident, saying Mr Sanderson had skied directly into her back as she went down the slope with her two children. I thought, Is this a practical joke? Is someone doing something perverted? This is really, really strange, she said in her testimony. Mr Sanderson was conscious when she skied away, Paltrow said, and even apologised to her. Paltrows lawyers worked to undermine Mr Sandersons claim that his health was ruined by the crash, pointing out a long list of trips he took after the accident to South America, Europe and Morocco. And they accused Mr Sanderson of trying to exploit their clients fame, asking about an email he sent to his daughters shortly after the collision, in which he wrote: Im famous. The closely watched case hinged on skiing etiquette, with both parties claiming that they were the downhill skier and therefore had right of way. But the testimony also contained several inadvertently funny moments, with lawyers asking Ms Paltrow about her height, her fashion, and how close she was with singer Taylor Swift. I would not say were good friends. We are friendly, Ms Paltrow replied. There was also a mini courtroom battle over the provision of a gift from Ms Paltrow to court security staff, which was ultimately denied by the judge. One of Ms Paltrows security guards later told BBC News that she had wanted to buy them lunch. And in another exchange, Kristan VanOrman, one of Mr Sandersons lawyers, told Ms Paltrow during cross-examination that she was jealous of her height. Speaking to reporters after the verdict, the lawyer said she was not starstruck during the trial. I have a newfound appreciation for Ms Paltrow if she has to deal with all this media attention on a daily basis, she said. Source: BBC -Agencies",

        "content": "The Colombo District Court today (March 31) granted leave for a request made by the respondents in the petition filed by State Minister Diana Gamage challenging the SJB party membership of Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa and Ranjith Madduma Bandara. Thereby, the leader and general secretary of the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB), who were listed as respondents in the petition, have been given time until May to file their objections. The SJB leader and the general secretary were supposed to bring up their objections when the petition was called today, however, their lawyers requested the court to fix another date for them to present their objections. Taking the request into consideration, the district court ordered the respondents to file their objections on May 22. In her petition, Gamage has sought an interim order preventing Sajith Premadasa and Ranjith Madduma Bandara, ruling that the two politicians are not suitable to hold their respective positions in the party. The petitioner points out that, pursuant to the SJBs constitution, a member of another political party cannot hold membership in the SJB. She said there are pending court cases filed by Sajith Premadasa and Ranjith Madduma Bandara with regard to their membership in another political party. Hence, Gamage has sought an interim order ruling that it is unlawful for the duo to hold their respective positions in the SJB.",

Accordingly, sources claimed that the paediatric ward attached to the Univeristy Professors Unit was closed down owing to the fact that all three paediatricians who worked at the hospital migrated. Thus, all doctors, nurses and patients who were attached to the childrens ward have been transferred to different wards by way of an internal circular issued within the hospital. Meanwhile future patients will also be referred to two different wards. Meanwhile, the relevant sources also revealed that students of the medical faculty of the Rajarata University of Sri Lanka are currently unable to receive any clinical training owing to the closure of the ward. Another group of doctors at the Anuradhapura Teaching Hospital are also reportedly readying to depart from Sri Lanka, sources claimed, while the Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) raised concerns that the residents within the district are now facing rather catastrophic circumstances. Speaking on the situation, the GMOA noted that they had given continuous warnings in the past that such a concerning situation would arise if such arbitrary taxes were imposed amidst an environment that was already not suitable for professionals.",

        "date": "March 31, 2023 01:53 pm",
        "content": "Sri Lankan migrant workers foreign remittances amounted to a total of USD 407 million in February 2023, the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) says. According to the latest External Sector Performance report issued by the CBSL, foreign remittances had amounted to only USD 205 million in February last year. Sri Lanka registered over USD 400 million in migrant workers remittances in the first two months of this year, with the figure reaching USD 437.5 million in January. The deficit in the merchandise trade account narrowed significantly to USD 39 million in February 2023, from USD 780 million in February 2022, mainly reflecting the impact of significant moderation of import expenditure due to subdued aggregate demand conditions. The cumulative deficit in the trade account during January-February 2023 was USD 449 million, a sizeable decline from US dollars 1,636 million recorded over the same period in 2022. Meanwhile, earnings from merchandise exports on year-on-year basis have declined by 10.2 percent in February 2023, amounting to USD 982 million, despite recording a marginal growth compared to January 2023. Exports earnings recorded below USD 1 billion level for the second consecutive month. While the decline in earnings was observed across all main categories, industrial exports mainly contributed to the overall contraction. Cumulative export earnings during January-February 2023 declined by 10.7 per cent over the same period in the last year. Expenditure on merchandise imports was almost halved in February 2023 at USD 1,021 million, compared to February 2022, recording the lowest imports since May 2020. All major import sectors declined while the decline in expenditure on intermediate goods was significant. Meanwhile, cumulative import expenditure during January-February 2023 also declined by 37.1 per cent over the corresponding period in 2022. Meanwhile, the total departures for foreign employment were meanwhile recorded at 23,974 during the month of February 2023. According to the CBSL, the total departures of foreign employment comprised unskilled (7,662), domestic aid (6,939) and skilled (6,582) categories. Tourism sector saw an improvement, as the arrivals increased in February 2023 to 107,639, compared to 102,545 arrivals recorded in January 2023 and 96,507 recorded in February 2022. Russia, India, the United Kingdom, Germany, and France remained the main source countries for tourist arrivals in February 2023. Earnings from tourism in the month of February 2023 are estimated at USD 170 million, in comparison to USD 162 million in the previous month and USD 169 million in the corresponding month in the previous year.",

        "date": "March 31, 2023 05:04 pm",
        "content": "Sri Lanka will assess a restructuring of its domestic debt next month and expects to finalise it by May, officials from the countrys central bank and the Treasury told international creditors during a virtual presentation on Thursday. The country expects that exploring options for a domestic debt operation will help to achieve a much-needed liquidity relief, both from a debt optimization of local currency T-Bills and T-Bonds. Government officials told investors that only T-Bills held by the central bank would be considered for a debt restructuring, while a voluntary domestic debt operation was expected for the holders of T-Bonds. Sri Lankas total currency debt is equivalent to USD 36.6 billion, according to the presentation. Central Bank Governor Dr. Nandalal Weerasinghe and Treasury Secretary Mahinda Siriwardana participated in the presentation, along with representatives of financial and legal advisers Lazard and Clifford Chance. The 22 million people island nation is struggling with its worst economic crisis in more than seven decades, which has led to shortages of essentials and the ouster of a president. Source: Reuters -Agencies Read the statement, jointly issued by the Central Bank governor and Treasury Secretary following the virtual presentation, below: On 20th March 2023, the IMF Board approved Sri Lankas IMF program, unlocking up to 7bn in funding from the IMF and other IFIs. The IMF program provides a clear roadmap in terms of policy implementation and will stabilize the economy of Sri Lanka and allow the country to regain its growth potential and address its economic vulnerabilities. Today, we held an investor presentation in order to explain the current macroeconomic situation in Sri Lanka, and outline the key pillars and objectives of the IMF program as well as the next steps with regard to the engagement with creditors. The Sri Lankan Government has embarked on an ambitious reform agenda, and we have successfully achieved all prior actions required to unlock the IMF financing. As per the IMF program, we are fully committed to achieving fiscal consolidation and implementing fiscal structural reforms; restoring public debt sustainability; restoring price stability and rebuilding external buffers; safeguarding financial system stability; and reducing corruption vulnerabilities and further introducing growth-enhancing reforms. Sri Lankan people are the Governments priority, and as part of the IMF program, we aim to enhance the existing social safety nets to protect the most vulnerable. As a result, Sri Lankas economy has already shown some encouraging stabilization signs, with year-on-year inflation slowing down and earnings from tourism rebounding to more standard levels. We will continue to implement our reform agenda in order to support Sri Lankas economic recovery and successfully complete the IMF program. Despite the ambitious fiscal consolidation efforts, Sri Lankas public debt trajectory is set to remain unsustainable in the absence of a comprehensive debt treatment. Sri Lanka is also facing a significant external financing gap over the IMF program period. This financing gap will have to be covered through new external funding and external debt service relief. The Authorities are also exploring options for a domestic debt optimization (DDO) operation aimed at liquidity relief while preserving financial stability to avoid further eroding of Sri Lankas repayment capacity. It is envisaged that this DDO will be conducted on a voluntary basis and be based on our consultations with major T-Bonds holders. As we move ahead, we are looking forward to accelerating and intensifying engagement with all our creditors in a transparent way, in good faith, and we are hoping to reach debt treatment agreements that are consistent with the IMF debt sustainability analysis and with the comparability of treatment principle.",

        "content": "The International Commission of Jurists (IC) has raised concerns over the newly proposed Anti-Terrorism Bill in Sri Lanka. Issuing a statement in this regard, the ICJ noted that they are extremely concerned by the Bill in question, adding that clause 4(1) of the Bill, if adopted, would introduce the death penalty for the terrorism offence of murder. The ICJ is opposed to the death penalty in all circumstances, as a violation of the right to life, and as the ultimate cruel, inhuman and degrading punishment, the statement read. Further, ICJs Senior Adviser Livio Zilli said that Purported threats to national security, whether or not arising in connection with acts of terrorism, should not be used as a justification for the death penalty. Despite acknowledging that the Bill defeated certain discrepancies of the PTA, often referred to as a draconian piece of legislation, the ICJ stated that the Bill still comprised of problematic aspects which outweighed the positives. Citing several other clauses of the proposed Bill, Zilli stated If enacted as currently formulated, these vague and overbroad offences, similar to and building up on those contained in the PTA, are open to abuse and, as such, they violate Sri Lankas international legal obligations and the countrys own constitutional guarantees under Article 13. Thus, despite consistently having called for the PTA to be repealed, the ICJ stated that while it renews these calls, it also urges that Sri Lanka immediately halt its attempts to replace it with an even worse piece of legislation.",

Noting that it is the duty of the government to accelerate digitalization by digitalizing the public sector, the Head of State promised to set up a committee of Cabinet ministers to ensure that the public sector utilization is done rapidly. He made this observation addressing the launching ceremony of the DIGIECON 2030, a digital economy 2030 master plan and a regulatory policy framework kick-off aimed at developing a regulatory framework and the master plan towards transforming the country into an inclusive digital economy. The event, organized by the Ministry of Technology, was held at the Temple Trees. The keynote address was delivered by Regional Cluster Lead for South Asia for Digital Development, World Bank Siddartha Raja on Leveraging Digital Economy towards a Sustainable and Resilient Sri Lanka. During the event, the DIGIECON SRI LANKA 2023-2030 website was launched by President Wickremesinghe, with the support extended by ICT associations. The launch of DIGIECON 2030, which was concocted on a concept of President Wickremesinghe, is deemed a crucial step in Sri Lankas transformation towards an inclusive digital economy. DIGIECON 2030 will also facilitate scale-ups for over 50 of the most innovative start-ups, small- and medium-scale enterprises (SMEs) and technological developments in Sri Lanka, across a diverse range of industries with a platform to access global investors and markets. Speaking further, President Wickremesinghe said Rs. 100 million has been set aside for universities and private sector institutions for this year to commence the development of a digital policy and another Rs. 1 billion next year for research in the IT sector and Artificial Intelligence to develop the digital economy.",

The PTA came into effect in 1979 as a temporary measure during the conflict with the separatist group LTTE and it was later made permanent in 1982. Since its enactment, the PTA was heavily criticized, with both local international organizations including the United Nations, Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International repeatedly urging the Sri Lankan authorities to do away with the Act, which they deemed a legal black hole and referred to as a draconian piece of legislation. Hence, the new Anti-Terrorism Bill was later brought forth to replace the controversial PTA, however, many rights advocates including the Centre for Policy Alternatives (CPA) and the International Commission of Jurists (ICJ) have raised deep concerns about the new Bill. They stress that the Bill requires serious attention, especially when authorities have used security laws to target minorities, critics and protesters, entrenching a culture of torture and impunity in Sri Lanka. Although the Bill has defeated certain discrepancies of the PTA, they stated that the Bill still carries problematic aspects which outweighed the positives. The rights advocates have pointed out that one improvement in the Bill is that confessions made by suspects in detention to a police officer are no longer admissible in evidence  a general principle in the ordinary law, for which an exception was made in the PTA. However, concerns have been raised about placing the power to make detention orders in the hands of a Deputy Inspector General of Police (DIG)  a power which, under the PTA, is held by the Defence Minister. Further, rights advocates have pointed out that allowing detention orders to be made for up to 3 months, similar to that of the PTA, is a grave concern. They have appealed to the Sri Lankan authorities not to replace the PTA with an even worse piece of legislation.",

        "date": "April 1, 2023 04:38 pm",
        "content": "Pope Francis left hospital on Saturday morning after spending three days recovering from bronchitis, according to the Vatican press office. The pope, standing on his feet, answered reporters questions outside Rome Gemelli hospital. He then embraced a crying woman and proceeded to bless her. Pope Francis also spoke to a couple, then got in the front passenger seat of a white Fiat 500. Pope Francis said he will deliver the Angelus Prayer tomorrow on Palm Sunday from St Peters Square. The Director of the Vatican press office, Matteo Bruni, released two press releases early Saturday. This morning, Saturday 1 April, Pope Francis was discharged from the A. Gemelli University Hospital. Before leaving the facility, the Holy Father greeted the Rector of the Catholic University, Franco Anelli, with his closest collaborators , the General Director of the Polyclinic hospital, Marco Elefanti, the general ecclesiastical assistant of the Catholic University, Monsignor Claudio Giuliodori, and the team of doctors and health workers who assisted him during these days, the statement read. As he left the Polyclinic, Pope Francis got out of the car and greeted the people present. He embraced a couple of parents who lost their daughter last night, stopping to pray with them. The pontiffs hospital stay had gone well with normal medical progress, officials said. Francis, according to a statement, ate pizza for dinner on Thursday night, had breakfast yesterday morning, read his newspapers and then went back to work. I can confirm that, since he is scheduled to leave the hospital on Saturday, Pope Francis is expected to be present in St. Peters Square on Sunday for the Eucharistic celebration of Palm Sunday, the Passion of the Lord, Bruni said in a statement. Francis, 86, was taken Wednesday to the Gemelli University Hospital after complaining of some respiratory difficulties and had tests performed. The outcome of these showed a respiratory infection (excluding Covid 19 infection) that will require several days of appropriate hospital medical treatment, the press office said at the time. Bronchitis occurs when the airways in the lungs, which are known as the bronchial tubes, become inflamed. It often develops as a result of viral infections including the common cold, influenza and RSV, according to the National Institutes of Health. Its unknown what treatment the Pope is receiving aside from an infusion-based antibiotic therapy, according to the Vatican. The NIH says most cases of bronchitis clear up on their own with a mix of over-the-counter medications to relieve coughing and loosen mucus, drinking hot tea or water, and inhaler medications if needed. The overnight stay marked the first time the Vatican has publicly announced that Francis has gone to the hospital since he underwent surgery to have part of his colon removed in July 2021 due to intestinal inflammation. Its previously been reported that the Pope had part of one lung removed as a young man because of a respiratory infection. President Joe Biden sent well wishes to Francis during remarks at an event Wednesday celebrating Greek Independence Day. The pope is ill now, so say an extra prayer for him, said Biden, who -- in 2021 -- became the first Roman Catholic U.S. leader in more than half a century to meet at the Vatican with the head of the Catholic Church. On Thursday, Francis sent a message of thanks to those whod wished him well. I am touched by the many messages received in these hours and I express my gratitude for the closeness and prayer, he said on Twitter. Source: ABC News -Agencies",

        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe says, during his tenure as the Head of State, he will not tolerate any breach of law and order in the country. He emphasized that he would prioritize doing what is right over doing what is popular, and that presenting popular ideas can lead to the destruction of the country. He made these remarks this evening (April 01) during his address to the Tri-Forces and the Police officers and other rankers at the Air Force Base, Anuradhapura, as the Commander in Chief of the armed forces. He asserted that no one is entitled to engage in violent protests on the streets, but all political parties have the right to express their opinions or criticize him in a peaceful manner. The Head of State went on to emphasize the importance of doing the right thing, and mentioned that they presented the International Monetary Fund (IMF) agreement to the parliament to assess whether the parliamentarians had the courage to make the right decisions for the betterment of the country. The President referred to the IMF agreement as an example and expressed his expectation for everyones assistance in making the IMF program successful. He also stated that if the country adopts a fresh approach and embarks on a new journey, it can achieve significant development within the next 25 years. The President asserted that Sri Lanka would win the economic war, similar to the successful fight against terrorism, adding that measures would be taken to establish economic independence in the country. He acknowledged that the armed forces and police would continue to play a crucial role in achieving economic independence, and also assessed the actions of the armed forces and police in maintaining law and order during the previous year. The President expressed gratitude towards the armed forces for fulfilling their responsibility, as without their efforts, Sri Lanka would have become an anarchic state. He also mentioned that the ongoing competition between world powers is affecting the Indian Ocean, and he intends to take action as the President to protect Sri Lanka from this influence. The President emphasized that future military situations can be shaped by technology and knowledge, unlike in the past. He highlighted the need for the armed forces and police to be equipped with modern technology and knowledge to overcome future challenges. The President initiated the Defence 2030 program, aiming to strengthen the defence forces of Sri Lanka. Promising to introduce stringent laws to combat the drug scourge, he said no amnesty would be granted to drug offenders. The President said that he had instructed the Minister of Public Security Tiran Alles, and Justice Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe to take strict action against such offenders and to utilize the support of the armed forces in this effort.

She communicated this during the meeting of the Parliamentary Caucus for Children held last week. Wijerathna noted that representatives of various institutions under the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Education, the National Child Protection Authority, the Department of Probation and Child Care Services present at this Committee meeting should be included in this committee to which the Ministry of Education should take the main responsibility when it comes to the related coordination activities. The committee chair also stated that the responsibilities of this Committee should be completed within three months and a timeline for that is expected to be prepared during the next meeting. Officials representing the Ministry of Education addressing the committee, stated that textbooks have already been prepared to educate school students over the age of sixteen about sexual and reproductive health. However, the committee emphasized that since there is a need to educate children about sexual and reproductive health from an early age to suit the childs mind, the preparation of textbooks should be started immediately. It was also discussed that in the first phase of this program, even if the text books are not printed, students can be given the opportunity to use it via the internet. It was also emphasized that the committee should also organize programs to educate religious leaders, parents, and the media about the need to educate students about sexual and reproductive health in order to protect them from sexual abuse. Suggestions were also made that during the awareness given to women through the Family Health Officers officials post marriage, they should also be made aware of how to protect their children from sexual abuse in the future.",

        "title": "ChatGPT banned in Italy over privacy concerns",
        "date": "April 1, 2023 07:07 pm",
        "content": "Italy has become the first Western country to block advanced chatbot ChatGPT. The Italian data-protection authority said there were privacy concerns relating to the model, which was created by US start-up OpenAI and is backed by Microsoft. The regulator said it would ban and investigate OpenAI with immediate effect. OpenAI told the BBC it complied with privacy laws. Millions of people have used ChatGPT since it launched in November 2022. It can answer questions using natural, human-like language and it can also mimic other writing styles, using the internet as it was in 2021 as its database. Microsoft has spent billions of dollars on it and it was added to Bing last month. It has also said that it will embed a version of the technology in its Office apps, including Word, Excel, PowerPoint and Outlook. There have been concerns over the potential risks of artificial intelligence (AI), including its threat to jobs and the spreading of misinformation and bias. Earlier this week key figures in tech, including Elon Musk, called for these types of AI systems to be suspended amid fears the race to develop them was out of control. The Italian watchdog said that not only would it block OpenAIs chatbot but it would also investigate whether it complied with General Data Protection Regulation. GDPR governs the way in which we can use, process and store personal data. The watchdog said on 20 March that the app had experienced a data breach involving user conversations and payment information. It said there was no legal basis to justify the mass collection and storage of personal data for the purpose of training the algorithms underlying the operation of the platform. It also said that since there was no way to verify the age of users, the app exposes minors to absolutely unsuitable answers compared to their degree of development and awareness. Bard, Googles rival artificial-intelligence chatbot, is now available, but only to specific users over the age of 18 - because of those same concerns. The Italian data-protection authority said OpenAI had 20 days to say how it would address the watchdogs concerns, under penalty of a fine of 20 million (21.7m) or up to 4 of annual revenues. Elsewhere, the Irish data protection commission told the BBC it is following up with the Italian regulator to understand the basis for their action and will coordinate with all EU data protection authorities in connection to the ban. The Information Commissioners Office, the UKs independent data regulator, told the BBC it would support developments in AI but that it was also ready to challenge non-compliance with data protection laws. Dan Morgan, from cybersecurity ratings provider SecurityScorecard said the ban shows the importance of regulatory compliance for companies operating in Europe. Businesses must prioritise the protection of personal data and comply with the stringent data protection regulations set by the EU - compliance with regulations is not an optional extra. Not sufficiently regulated Consumer advocacy group BEUC also called on EU and national authorities - including data-protection watchdogs - to investigate ChatGPT and similar chatbots, following the filing of a complaint in the US. Although the EU is currently working on the worlds first legislation on AI, BEUCs concern is that it would take years before the AI Act could take effect, leaving consumers at risk of harm from a technology that is not sufficiently regulated. Ursula Pachl, deputy director general of BEUC, warned that society was currently not protected enough from the harm that AI can cause. There are serious concerns growing about how ChatGPT and similar chatbots might deceive and manipulate people. These AI systems need greater public scrutiny, and public authorities must reassert control over them, she said. ChatGPT is already blocked in a number of countries, including China, Iran, North Korea and Russia. OpenAI told the BBC that it had disabled ChatGPT for users in Italy at the request of the Italian data protection regulator, called the Garante: We are committed to protecting peoples privacy and we believe we comply with GDPR and other privacy laws, it wrote. The organisation said it worked to reduce personal data in training AI systems like ChatGPT because it wanted its AI systems to learn about the world, not about private individuals. We also believe that AI regulation is necessary  so we look forward to working closely with the Garante and educating them on how our systems are built and used, it added OpenAI said it looked forward to making ChatGPT available in Italy again soon.

        "content": "A group of petroleum trade unionists met with former President Mahinda Rajapaksa to discuss their issues and the Ceylon Petroleum Corporations move to send several employees and trade union members on compulsory leave for disrupting the fuel distribution process. Following the meeting which lasted for nearly two hours this morning (April 01), the trade unionists said they were hopeful that the former Head of State would intervene to resolve the matter. A strike action was launched by the petroleum trade unions earlier this week, in protest of the governments alleged attempts to privatize the CPC and to hand over the fuel distribution activities in the country to foreign entities. On March 29, Minister of Power  Energy Kanchana Wijesekera announced that the CPC management had decided to send on compulsory leave the petroleum trade union leaders and members, who hindered the fuel distribution activities the day before, exerted pressure on the employees who were working on fuel distribution duties and attempted to obstruct those services, as well as the workers who supported these union leaders. Accordingly, a total of 20 trade unionists including several CPC and Ceylon Petroleum Storage Terminals Limited (CPSTL) employees were sent on compulsory leave and barred from entering both CPC and storage terminal premises. It was reported that all trade unionists and petroleum employees who were sent on compulsory leave, except Petroleum General Employees Union president Ashoka Ranwala, met with the former President today.

        "date": "April 1, 2023 09:51 pm",
        "content": "Russia has taken the presidency of the UN Security Council despite Ukraine urging members to block the move. Each of the councils 15 members takes up the presidency for a month, on a rotating pattern. The last time Russia had the presidency, February 2022, it launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine. It means the Security Council is being led by a country whose president is subject to an international arrest warrant for alleged war crimes. The International Criminal Court - which is not a UN institution - issued the warrant for Vladimir Putin last month. Despite Ukraines complaints, the United States said it could not block Russia - a permanent council member - from assuming the presidency. The other permanent members of the council are the UK, US, France, and China. The role is mostly procedural, but Moscows ambassador to the UN, Vasily Nebenzia, told the Russian Tass news agency that he planned to oversee several debates, including one on arms control. He said he would discuss a new world order that, he said, was coming to replace the unipolar one. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba called Russias presidency the worst joke ever for April Fools Day and a stark reminder that something is wrong with the way international security architecture is functioning. Ukraines presidential adviser, Mykhaylo Podolyak, said the move was another rape of international law... an entity that wages an aggressive war, violates the norms of humanitarian and criminal law, destroys the UN Charter, neglects nuclear safety, cant head the worlds key security body. President Volodymyr Zelensky called last year for the Security Council to reform or dissolve altogether, accusing it of failing to take enough action to prevent Russias invasion. He has also called for Russia to be removed of its member status. But the US has said its hands were tied as the UN charter does not allow for the removal of a permanent member. Unfortunately, Russia is a permanent member of the Security Council and no feasible international legal pathway exists to change that reality, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told a news briefing this week. She added the US expects Moscow to continue to use its seat on the council to spread disinformation and justify its actions in Ukraine. The UN Security Council is an international body responsible for maintaining peace. Five nations are permanently represented on the Security Council. They reflect the post-war power structure that held sway when the council was formed. Members of this group work alongside 10 non-permanent member countries. Russias presence as a permanent member on the Security Council means it can veto resolutions. To pass a Security Council vote, there must be nine votes in favour, with none of the five permanent members voting against. In February last year Russia vetoed a resolution that intended to end the Russian invasion of Ukraine (China, India and the United Arab Emirates all abstained). In September it vetoed a resolution calling for the reversal of its illegal annexation of four regions of Ukraine. Brazil, China, Gabon and India abstained. Source: BBC -Agencies",

        "date": "April 1, 2023 11:21 pm",
        "content": "India and Japan have jointly agreed to cooperate with Sri Lanka to bolster regional connectivity in the strategic Indo-Pacific, a media report said on Friday, amid Chinas aggressive military manoeuvring in the resource-rich region. The US, India and several other world powers have been talking about the need to ensure a free, open and thriving Indo-Pacific. China is engaged in hotly contested territorial disputes in the South and East China Seas. Beijing has also made substantial progress in militarising its man-made islands over the past few years. Indian High Commissioner Gopal Baglay said India and Japan share wide-ranging interests in a peaceful, progressive and prosperous Indo-Pacific region, the Daily Mirror Lanka newspaper reported. He made these remarks at an event here in the presence of the Japanese envoy Mizukoshi Hideaki, it said. Asserting that Sri Lanka is an important member of the Indian Ocean Rim Association (IROA) countries, Baglay said there is a great deal of opportunity for India, Japan and Sri Lanka to work together for the prosperity of people here and the benefit of all sides, the report said. This should be in accordance with the priorities of Sri Lanka, he said. Sri Lanka is at the happy confluence of three important pillars of Indias foreign policy, Baglay was quoted as saying in the report. Japanese Ambassador Hideaki said that during Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishidas recent visit to India, the two countries exchanged views on cooperation with Sri Lanka and agreed to work closely. I believe that connectivity is the best area to showcase how two countries can bring tangible benefits to the entire region including Sri Lanka. To this end, perspectives and insights from countries in the region are critical, and this report precisely addresses that, he was quoted as saying in the report. Sri Lanka is a key part of Chinas Belt and Road Initiative, a long-term plan to fund and build infrastructure linking China to the rest of the world. But Chinas unproductive projects in Sri Lanka, including the Hambantota port, which Beijing took over on a 99-year lease in 2017 as a debt swap, have come under sharp criticism. Earlier this month, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) approved a USD 3 billion bailout programme to help Sri Lanka overcome its economic crisis and catalyse financial support from other development partners, a move welcomed by Colombo as a historic milestone in the critical period. Last week, Sri Lanka received USD 330 million as the first tranche of the IMF bailout programme, which will pave the way for the debt-ridden country to achieve better fiscal discipline and improved governance, according to President Wickremesinghe. Sri Lanka was hit by an unprecedented financial crisis in 2022, the worst since its independence from Britain in 1948, due to a severe paucity of foreign exchange reserves, sparking political turmoil in the country that led to the ouster of the all-powerful Rajapaksa family.

        "date": "April 2, 2023 08:00 am",
        "content": "(Reuters) - A violent storm packing high winds and heavy rains ripped through Southern and Midwestern sections of the United States as it headed east on Saturday, leaving at least 22 dead and scores injured, according to officials and media reports. At least five people were killed in Arkansas, according to officials, as first responders sifted through debris for more possible victims after tornadoes sliced through the state on Friday. Meanwhile, the Tennessee Department of Health confirmed seven weather-related deaths in McNairy County, at the Mississippi border. Tennessee Emergency Management Agency Director Patrick Sheehan said the number of people injured and damaged structures in several counties were not yet determined. Just south of the Tennessee border in Madison County, Alabama, 90-year-old Ovie Lasater was killed when a tornado destroyed her home, county coroner Tyler Berryhill told Reuters. Fox News reported another death in Pontotoc County in neighboring Mississippi. In Illinois, three people were killed in Crawford County after the collapse of a residential structure, the state Emergency Management Agency said. These were in addition to the 50-year-old man who died in Belvidere, a city in northern Illinois, after a roof collapsed at a theater with 260 people inside. Dan Zaccard, a senior emergency management official in Boone County, said on Saturday that the incident left 40 people injured. The crowd at the citys Apollo Theatre was attending a concert featuring the heavy-metal group Morbid Angel, which was on its Tour of Terror. One person was killed in Sussex County, Delaware, after a line of powerful storms tore through the region on Saturday night, an ABC News affiliate reported. The National Weather Service on Saturday warned of thunderstorms moving across the eastern third of the United States, likely resulting in power outages and downed trees from winds with gusts over 60 mph (100 kph). The twisters sheared roofs and walls from many buildings in Arkansas, flipped over vehicles and downed trees and power lines in Little Rock and large areas east and northeast of the state capital, officials said. The blast of extreme spring weather swept much of the United States on Friday, menacing the nations midsection from Texas to the Great Lakes with thunderstorms and tornados. Arkansas Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders on Saturday said there were five confirmed dead in the state. Right now, we have five confirmed fatalities. We have a couple of others that have been reported, but we do not have confirmation from local law enforcement on the ground. And, so, awaiting that. But right now, statewide, we have five confirmed fatalities, she said. Four of the Arkansas fatalities were reported in Wynne, about 100 miles (160 km) east of Little Rock, Cross County Coroner Eli Long said. One person was killed and more than 50 people were hospitalized in North Little Rock, Pulaski County spokeswoman Madeline Roberts told the Washington Post. U.S. President Joe Biden spoke with Huckabee Sanders and the mayors of Little Rock and Wynne, the White House said in a statement. He also spoke with Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Administrator Deanne Criswell. Huckabee Sanders said Biden and Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, in phone calls on Saturday, offered federal government support. Anything that Arkansas needs, they have assured us that those resources will be here and on the ground, she said at a news conference. In Sullivan County, Indiana, three people were killed, Indiana State Police Sergeant Matt Ames said. A state of emergency was declared for the affected areas, Sheriff Jason Bobbitt said on Facebook. The turbulent weather occurred one week after a swarm of thunderstorms unleashed a deadly tornado that devastated the Mississippi town of Rolling Fork, destroying many of the communitys 400 homes and killing 26 people.

        "title": "National new rice harvest festival held at Siri Maha Bodhi",
        "date": "April 2, 2023 11:43 am",
        "content": "The National New Paddy Harvest Festival, known as the Aluth Sahal Mangalya, was held at the historic Jaya Sri Maha Bodhiya in Anuradhapura this morning (02 April), under the patronage of President Ranil Wickremesinghe. This festival is a longstanding tradition where the first harvested paddy of the Maha season is offered to the Jaya Sri Maha Bodhiya. The event was organized for the 56th time by the Ministry of Agriculture and the Department of Agrarian Services, under the guidance of the Chief Incumbent of the Atamasthana, Venerable Pallegema Hemarathana Thera. Many farmers from different parts of the country attended the traditional ceremony with the hope of receiving blessings from nature and the Triple Gem. Their wish was for timely showers, bountiful harvests, and a prosperous economy for the country and the nation. After the traditional ceremony, the President paid his respects to the sacred Sri Maha Bodhiya and received blessings. The procession followed the ancient traditions and began near the Anuradhapura Lion Pillar before entering the Sri Maha Bodhiya premises through the Walimaluwa. It is a traditional custom for the Atamasthanadipati Ven. Pallegama Hemarathana Thera to fill the golden offertory bowl with fresh rice from various regions of the country, accompanied by the chanting of Seth Pirith by the Maha Sangha. During this years ceremony, President Ranil Wickremesinghe also participated in the filling of the golden bowl with rice. That is an interesting and significant cultural practice for the offering of pure bees honey and ghee which is a way of showing respect and gratitude to the sacred Jaya Sri Maha Bodhiya, which is considered one of the most revered Buddhist relics in Sri Lanka. It also reflects the importance of nature and the traditional agricultural practices that are deeply ingrained in Sri Lankan culture. Mr. Chinthana Wilegoda, Chairman of the Traditional Rice Farmers Protection Organization, presented President Wickremesinghe with a bundle of rice pods that corresponded to his age. The President then distributed region-specific seeds and rice varieties to farmers from all nine provinces. Additionally, the President received a digital copy of the 56th National Aluth Sahal Mangalya commemorative edition. The Atamasthanadhipathi, Nuwara Kalaviya Chief Sanghanayake Ven. Pallegama Hemarathana Thera delivering a special exhortation said; The farmers have expressed their grievances about the inadequate prices they are receiving for their crops. We are empathetic to the challenges faced by farmers. A substantial amount of funding has been allocated by the government towards supporting the agriculture industry and farmers. It is imperative to address the issues faced by farmers in order to advance the country as a whole. Providing effective solutions to farmers problems has the potential to resolve many of the issues plaguing the nation. There is a need to modernize agriculture and promote sustainable practices by equipping farmers with modern knowledge and techniques. The current president possesses the necessary leadership qualities to drive this initiative forward. This endeavour transcends politics and is a crucial step towards progress for the entire nation. Minister of Agriculture Mahinda Amaraweera also expressed his views; Upon assuming office, the President inherited a situation where farmers were protesting on the streets, indicating the gravity of the issues they faced. The President took charge in such circumstances. When the responsibility of the Ministry of Agriculture was entrusted to me by the President, he instructed to ensure the timely supply of fertilizer to farmers to enhance crop yield for both the Yala and Maha seasons. President Ranil Wickremesinghe had forewarned about an impending global food crisis. Consequently, he held discussions with the Indian Government to secure the required fertilizer for the Maha season. It was only due to his personal intervention that we were able to obtain the necessary fertilizer from India. As a result of his efforts, we were successful in providing the necessary urea fertilizer for the Maha season, and we even distributed the stock received from the Chinese Government to farmers, free of charge. This enabled us to achieve our target harvest during the Maha season, and we were able to produce 3.3 million metric tons of rice. In gratitude for this success, we offer our gratitude at the Sacred Sri Maha Bodhiya. Moreover, we have been advised by the President to reach out to farmers and provide them with relief instead of requiring them to come to our offices. We are currently developing a QR code system for farmers to provide them with relevant allowances and subsidies seamlessly. Additionally, we have already discussed reducing the price of herbicides by 10 in the future. We are also exploring the possibility of introducing a third season for cultivation, in addition to the current Yala and Maha seasons. The third season has already commenced in the Hambantota district, where it is being cultivated as an alternative crop, rather than paddy. We encourage farmers from other districts to apply for this third season as well. We are also planning to incorporate modern technology into agriculture. Our goal is to transition crops that traditionally required 2.5 acres to grow to a more modern, efficient system that can be achieved in just half an acre of land. We have successfully promoted the cultivation of sour bananas as an export crop, and we are currently exporting one container of sour bananas every Saturday. We aim to increase this export volume to two containers by next month. The President has allocated a total of 56,000 million rupees towards the development of the agriculture industry. This presents an opportunity to modernize the industry and introduce new technologies. In the past, we used to rely on credit to obtain fertilizer, but the President has taken steps to pay off this debt. With these efforts, we aim to establish agriculture as a major economic foundation for our country. We are all committed to achieving this goal. Chancellor of the Rajarata University, Ruwanweli Chaityaramadhipathi Venerable Ethalavetunu Weve Gnanathilaka Thera, The Maha Sangha, including the Chief incumbent of the Lankarama Viharaya Venerable Ralapanawe Dhammajothi, Agriculture Minister Mahinda Amaraweera, Minister of Ports and Shipping Nimal Siripala de Silva, State Minister of Finance Shehan Semasinghe, Member of Parliament SM Chandrasena, Senior Advisor to the President on National Security and Chief of Staff to the President, Sagala Ratnayake, Governor of North Central Province Mahipala Herath and other officials attended this event.",

There were no other demands attached to this refusal to mark papers, Prof. Bannaheka said. Further, the Professor vehemently denied recent claims that the FUTA are marking the papers written by those in the Tamil medium, and have withdrawn only form the paper-marking process of those in the Sinhala medium, saying that Sinhala or Tamil is not relevant to this matter.

        "date": "April 2, 2023 07:01 pm",
        "content": "The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is warning travelers to take precaution in Equatorial Guinea and Tanzania amid outbreaks of the Marburg virus disease (MVD). The CDC also announced that it is sending personnel from its National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases to respond to the outbreaks. Equatorial Guinea declared an outbreak of MVD on Feb. 13, and Tanzania declared an outbreak of MVD on March 21, the CDC noted. The WHO has recorded at least nine confirmed cases in Guinea, and another 20 probable cases, all of whom have died as of March 25. Meanwhile, in Tanzania, the WHO confirmed eight cases, five of whom have died, with the remaining three people undergoing treatments as of March 22. People are being warned to avoid non-essential travel to the regions where the outbreak is occurring. In Equatorial Guinea, the provinces are Kie-Ntem, Centro Sur, and Litoral. In Tanzania, the Kagera region had the confirmed cases. Kenya and Uganda are on high alert due to the recent cases in Tanzania. MVD is often fatal and is caused by the Marburg virus, which is in the same family as the virus that causes Ebola. According to the CDC, (pdf) up to 9 out of 10 people infected with the virus will die without treatment. It causes a viral hemorrhagic fever that brings severe symptoms within seven days that include: high fever, chills, severe headache, muscle pain, malaise, rash, sore throat, diarrhea, weakness, uncontrolled bleeding or bruising, and more. CDC Recommendations The CDC recommends that people should watch for MVD symptoms while in the outbreak areas, and for 21 days after leaving the area. If they develop any of the symptoms, they must isolate themselves and seek medical care immediately, according to the CDC. The virus, like Ebola, originates in bats and can spread from infected bats to people, or between people, via direct contact with blood or body fluids. It can also be transmitted by contaminated surfaces. Other non-human primates, such as chimpanzees and gorillas, can also be infected with the virus and therefore pose a threat. The CDC advises that people who travel to Equatorial Guinea or Tanzania should: o Avoid contact with sick people who have symptoms such as fever, muscle pain, and rash. o Avoid contact with blood and other body fluids. o Avoid contact with dead bodies or items that have been in contact with dead bodies, participating in funeral or burial rituals, or attending a funeral or burial. o Avoid visiting health care facilities in the outbreak area for nonurgent medical care or for non-medical reasons. o Avoid visiting traditional healers. o Avoid contact with fruit bats and the caves and mines where they live. o Avoid nonhuman primates (e.g., chimpanzees, gorillas). Although no vaccines or drugs are currently authorized for MVD, infection control protocols can help prevent its transmission, and rehydration treatment to improve symptoms can improve peoples chances of survival. Marburg outbreaks and individual cases have in the past been recorded in Angola, Congo, Kenya, South Africa, Uganda, and Ghana, according to the WHO. The rare virus was first identified in 1967 after it caused simultaneous outbreaks of disease in laboratories in Marburg, Germany, and Belgrade, Serbia. Seven people died who were exposed to the virus while conducting research on monkeys. Source  The Epoch Times  AP News - Agencies",

        "content": "Pope Francis has led Mass in St Peters Square on Sunday, kicking off the years Easter services, just a day after leaving hospital. He oversaw the Palm Sunday ceremony in front of more than 30,000 faithful, followed by the Angelus prayer. He was admitted to Romes Gemelli Hospital on Wednesday with breathing difficulties, and later diagnosed with bronchitis. Upon being discharged on Saturday, the Pope joked that he was still alive. I just felt a malaise, but I wasnt afraid, Italian news agency Ansa quoted him as saying on Saturday. After being discharged, the pontiff was seen smiling and waving from his car, before getting out to speak to a crowd. Instead of heading home, his car drove past the Vatican and stopped at the Basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore. When he came out after praying, people on the street applauded and shouted: Long live the Pope! During another stop, he exited his vehicle to give chocolate Easter eggs to police officers in his motorcade, AP news agency reported. On Sunday he thanked those who prayed for him during his hospital stay. The pontiffs admission to hospital came ahead of the busiest week in the Christian calendar. The Holy Week includes a busy schedule of events and services which can be physically demanding. The Argentine pontiff, who marked 10 years as head of the Catholic Church earlier this month, has suffered a number of health issues throughout his life, including having part of one of his lungs removed at age 21. He has also used a wheelchair in recent months because of problems related to his knee. Wednesdays hospitalisation was his second since 2021, when he underwent colon surgery, also at Gemelli. But the Pope has remained active, visiting the Democratic Republic of Congo and South Sudan in February. The previous month, he led the funeral of his predecessor Pope Benedict XVI. Although the pontiff, who has pushed for reforms in the Catholic Church, has previously said he would consider stepping down if his health failed him, he recently confirmed he had no plans to quit.

Russias Foreign Ministry made no accusations of involvement in the attack, but said silence in Western capitals exposed hypocrisy over expressions of concern for journalists. Tatarsky, whose real name was Maxim Fomin, had more than 560,000 followers on Telegram and was one of the most prominent of the military bloggers who have championed Russias war effort in Ukraine while often criticising the army top brass. Well defeat everyone, well kill everyone, well rob everyone we need to. Everything will be as we like it, he was shown saying in a video last September at a Kremlin ceremony in which President Vladimir Putin claimed four partly occupied regions of Ukraine as Russian territory - a move rejected as illegal by most countries. TASS news agency quoted an unnamed source as saying the bomb was hidden in a miniature statue that was handed to Tatarsky as he addressed a group of people in the cafe. Mash, a Telegram channel with links to Russian law enforcement, posted a video that appeared to show Tatarsky, microphone in hand, being presented with a statuette of a helmeted soldier. It said the explosion happened minutes later. Prigozhin said that the cafe previously belonged to him, but he has since given it to patriotic activists who have been holding meetings there. Reuters was not able to independently confirm that. Denis Pushilin, the Moscow-installed leader of the part of Ukraines Donetsk province that is occupied by Russia, suggested publicly that Ukraine was to blame. He was killed vilely. Terrorists cannot do otherwise. The Kyiv regime is a terrorist regime. It needs to be destroyed, theres no other way to stop it, he said. Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova said the absence of reaction in Washington, London and Paris speaks for itself given their ostensible concern for the well-being of journalists and freedom of expression. The reaction in Kyiv is striking where those who receive Western grants are in no way concealing their delight at what has happened, she wrote on the ministrys website. RIPE ABSCESS Mykhailo Podolyak, a Ukrainian presidential adviser, wrote on Twitter that it had only been a matter of time - like the bursting of a ripe abscess - before Russia would be consumed by what he called domestic terrorism. The spiders are eating each other in a jar, he said. Tatarskys death followed the killing last August of Darya Dugina, the daughter of a prominent ultra-nationalist, in a car-bomb attack near Moscow. Russias Federal Security Service accused Ukraines secret services of carrying out that attack, which Putin called evil. Ukraine denied involvement. Prigozhin said on Sunday that both killings were likely the work of a group of radicals hardly related to the government, but not of Ukraine. Russias war bloggers, an assortment of military correspondents and freelance commentators with army backgrounds, have enjoyed broad freedom from the Kremlin to publish hard-hitting views on the war, now in its 14th month. Putin even made one of them a member of his human rights council last year. They reacted with shock to the news of Tatarskys death. He was in the hottest spots of the special military operation and he always came out alive. But the war found him in a Petersburg cafe, said Semyon Pegov, who blogs under the name War Gonzo.

        "date": "April 3, 2023 04:25 pm",
        "content": "Teachers in England have overwhelmingly rejected a pay offer from the British government aimed at ending a series of disruptive strikes, their trade union said on Monday, announcing two further days of walkouts. The National Education Union, Britains largest education union, said 98 of teachers who voted in the ballot followed its advice to reject the offer of a one-off payment this year of 1,000 pounds and an average pay rise of 4.5 in the next financial year. This resounding rejection of the governments offer should leave (education minister) Gillian Keegan in no doubt that she will need to come back to the negotiating table with a much better proposal, NEU joint General Secretaries Mary Bousted and Kevin Courtney said in a statement. Tens of thousands of teachers across Britain have taken strike action this year in demand of an above-inflation pay award, leaving classrooms empty and heaping pressure on Prime Minister Rishi Sunak to help resolve the dispute. The union said teachers would take two further days of strike action, on April 27 and May 2. It is extremely disappointing that the NEU have called more strike action, Keegan said in a statement. She also signalled the government did not intend to negotiate further: Pay will now be decided by the independent pay review body which will recommend pay rises for next year. The government has argued that higher pay rises would only worsen inflation. Teachers in Wales have ended their strike action after voting to accept a pay offer comprising an additional 3 pay award for 202223 alongside a 1.5 one-off payment, and a government-funded 5 rise for the following year. Scotlands largest teaching union has also accepted a pay deal to end long-running strikes, which it said would amount to a 14.6 increase in pay for most teachers by January 2024.

        "date": "April 3, 2023 05:08 pm",
        "content": "Indias Congress leader Rahul Gandhi was granted bail today in a 2019 defamation case and his two-year jail sentence was paused until a decision on his appeal challenging his conviction. A Gujarat court will take up his appeal on April 13. Mr Gandhi, accompanied by sister Priyanka Gandhi Vadra and several other Congress leaders including three Chief Ministers, approached Surats sessions court with an appeal to set aside his conviction over his Modi surname comment seen to be an insult to Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The former Congress president need not appear in court for the next hearing. After the court order, Mr Gandhi tweeted he is fighting against Mitrakal, alluding to the ruling BJP, often the target of the Congress over allegations of misusing government agencies to harass the opposition. This is a fight to save democracy, against Mitrakal. In this struggle, truth is my weapon, and truth is my support, Mr Gandhi tweeted in Hindi. If Mr Gandhis conviction is not reversed, his disqualification as an MP will stand and he will be barred from contesting elections for eight years. He has already started packing after agreeing to vacate his government bungalow. Mr Gandhi flew to Surat with a large group of Congress leaders. Chief ministers of three Congress-ruled states - Ashok Gehlot, Bhupesh Baghel and Sukhvinder Singh Sukhu - went with him. He met his mother Sonia Gandhi yesterday before his court appearance. The BJP called Mr Gandhis visit to Surat with his sister and some party leaders as a childish attempt to pressure the judiciary. Rahul Gandhi might be going to Surat to file an appeal. It is not required of a convict to go personally to file an appeal. Generally, no convict goes personally. His going personally with a motley group of leaders and aides accompanying him is only a drama, Law Minister Kiren Rijiju tweeted. What Rahul Gandhi is doing is also a childish attempt to bring pressure on the appellate court. All courts in the country are immune from such tactics, he said in another tweet. The Congress said the presence of the party leaders in Surat is not a show of strength, but a symbol of support for Mr Gandhi. Its not a show of strength. He is fighting for the country. They are going with him to support him in his fight, said Congress chief Mallikarjun Kharge. The party also alleged that illegal arrests were being made to prevent party leaders and workers from going to Surat. There are continuous reports of illegal arrests by the BJP government in Gujarat to prevent Congress leaders and workers from going to Surat, party leader Jairam Ramesh tweeted in Hindi. The 52-year-old was convicted by a court and sentenced to prison for two years in Gujarat last month for a 2019 speech in which he linked PM Modis last name with two fugitive businessmen, remarking how the thieves shared the same last name. The court, however, granted him bail for 30 days to appeal the verdict. The defamation case was filed against Mr Gandhi by Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MLA and former Gujarat minister Purnesh Modi for saying How come all thieves have the common surname Modi? Mr Gandhis Wayanad seat in Kerala is now vacant following his removal from the office and the Election Commission may now announce a special election for the seat. Mr Gandhis disqualification order prompted a fractured opposition to come together to attack the BJP over the alleged misuse of central investigative agencies against the members of rival parties. The BJP has said the conviction has come from an independent judiciary, with party president JP Nadda accusing Mr Gandhi of insulting an Other Backward Classes (OBC) community - a key vote base for the party.

        "date": "April 3, 2023 07:39 pm",
        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe announced that the agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) would be presented to Parliament for a vote on whether to support it and that following this vote, the key points of the agreement would be enacted into law. The President also indicated that the Prevention of Terrorism Bill, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, and the Anti-Corruption Bill would be submitted to Parliament by June, the Presidents Media Division (PMD) said. He shared these updates with university professors and heads of economic departments as part of a discussion about the IMF program at the Ministry of Finance Auditorium yesterday (April 02), the PMD reported. During the same discussion, President Ranil Wickremesinghe also urged universities to send ten of their most talented economics students to engage with government officials and provide their opinions on the IMF program. He also proposed that a group of students be awarded scholarships to attend recognized foreign universities. The President highlighted the need for automation in production and services in order for the country to remain competitive with nations like India and Bangladesh. He emphasized that the education system must be reformed to achieve this goal. However, he made it clear that he did not intend to approach the International Monetary Fund for the 18th time, it added. At the meeting, the President was joined by State Ministers of Finance, the Governor of the Central Bank, the Secretary of the Ministry of Finance, Vice-Chancellors of universities, and lecturers from economic departments. They all shared their thoughts on the IMF program, and their opinions and responses are as follows; President Ranil Wickremesinghe, First and foremost, it is anticipated that the agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) will be presented to Parliament for a vote on whether or not to support it. We encourage everyone to take a stance on this matter. We propose to support the program, but understand that some may wish to remain neutral. In addition, the main points of the IMF agreement will be enacted into law, and any necessary changes will be presented to Parliament. We aim to present the basic aspects of the agreement in May, with information about the program being disseminated to rural sectors after the New Year. Secondly, we plan to introduce our programs, including the green economy. However, we first need to assess the response to these programs. The anti-corruption law will be out very soon, maybe by May. There are three important bills that are coming out, Anti-terrorism Bill, Truth and Reconciliation Commission and Anti-Corruption. The Minister of Justice and the Chief Justice has asked that all three bills not be brought together because it is difficult for the Supreme Court to go into it and there will be a shortage of lawyers. Therefore, one bill will come out towards the end of April, followed by the other two and somewhere by June all three bills will come. The goal of our modernization program is to enhance production while maintaining competitiveness, which will require cooperation from all sectors. To this end, we are exploring the possibility of establishing an Agricultural Technical University by merging government research institutes and other institutions. Post-graduate courses could also be established if deemed necessary. This will strengthen the research process and facilitate the incorporation of technology. Lets unite all sectors and implement this program together. The IMF agreement has been thoroughly reviewed, and those present are knowledgeable enough to provide further explanation. However, any proposed solutions must adhere to the framework established by the International Monetary Fund. We have been given six months to work within this framework, and it is crucial that we do so. The majority, including farmers and tourism business owners, believe that this is necessary. While trade unions argue against privatization, if one-third of the money spent on these loss-making institutions was directed towards universities and the education sector, there would be greater progress. Addressing salary issues could also be a part of this effort. Trade unions cannot dictate our policies. We cannot afford to fall behind Afghanistan again; reforms are necessary. Even the opposition acknowledges the need for reform in the country. Despite bringing a bill and appointing a commission to create industries, we failed to advance industrialization. Our focus was on achieving peace after the war, but we still spent a significant amount of money on war efforts, especially the war from 1983-1987. Instead of industrialization, we pursued programs in the construction sector. If we had prioritized industrialization in 2009, we could have attracted a lot of investments. However, if we set conditions for foreign investors, they may not come. In fact, our local investors who have money in foreign bank accounts will be the first to invest if the situation is favourable. During President JR Jayawardanes tenure, the Mahaweli scheme, which was supposed to be completed in 30 years, was finished in 10 years. All institutions involved in the project were brought to Sri Lanka at the same time, which established methods of obtaining money for the people of Sri Lanka. This has led to some groups improving and investing in other projects. Currently, people are afraid that the economy will collapse and their businesses will fail, so they keep their money in London or Dubai. Its crucial for them to bring that money back to Sri Lanka. We propose to select ten talented final year students studying economics in universities to participate in discussions with officials and ministers. In addition, we aim to provide four talented students with foreign scholarships to renowned universities such as Harvard, Cambridge, Oxford, and Stanford. Minister of State for Finance, Mr. Ranjith Siyambalapitiya; Today, I am talking to economic experts along with the President, who also studied at a Sri Lankan university. Our country has had ministers who left the cabinet when they proposed going to the International Monetary Fund in the past. Due to inflation, we had to increase bank interest rates and control imports which affected people from all levels of society. Consequently, we had to seek help from the International Monetary Fund, a decision the President had warned about twenty years ago. At that time, we were on the opposing side and went with the popular stand, but we now realize that it was a mistake. The President has announced that we will not seek assistance from the International Monetary Fund for the 18th time. We need to take responsibility for our economy, and I expect the contribution of the economic experts to achieve this goal. Central Bank Governor Dr. Nandalal Weerasinghe; A professional-level discussion is taking place here that goes beyond the topic of trade unions. Despite having gone to the International Monetary Fund 16 times, success was not possible due to some improperly implemented conditions. Negotiations were used to increase taxes, and it is now impractical for the country to remove the agreements made. There are two ways to remove the tax package, but both require time: either collect more taxes from people or increase the governments income and salaries. The private sector has made some changes and if successful, could provide relief in the future. However, high-income earners are the ones criticizing the situation, saying they cannot afford it for six months. The manufacturing economy is the economic advantage a country gains by producing goods. The production of goods and services increases income from gross domestic product. Value addition in the agricultural sector can lead to significant income, as has been shown during this discussion. However, for the younger generation to turn to agriculture, it must be made more efficient. Currently, young people going abroad are not working in agriculture but in the service sector. Although agriculture contributes only seven per cent to the economy, it employs 27 per cent of the workforce. People working in the service sector can earn income by improving agricultural production. The development of both the manufacturing and service sectors is necessary for the countrys growth. Senior Professor Sampath Amaratunga, Chairman of the University Grants Commission Inviting university professors to discuss the International Monetary Fund agreement is a great honour to the university system. Vice-chancellors, professors, lecturers, members of the University Grants Commission, and even young lecturers can benefit from participating in these discussions. As a country, we are currently facing an economic crisis, and debt has been a topic of discussion for years. If there are alternative proposals or models, we should explore them. Those who oppose the current program in parliament should be asked to present an alternative model. India recently privatized its airline, Air India, due to continuous losses. It begs the question, why should Sri Lanka keep an airline that is causing billions of losses, while India doesnt? To overcome the current crisis, we should study the decisions made in the 1980s and how New Zealand managed to recover from a crisis. New Zealand implemented excellent policies to reduce the economic burden on the government and directed the private sector to do business. We should learn from their example. Senior Professor Udith K Jayasinghe, Vice Chancellor of North West University As a group of experts, we have prepared a policy on agri-food, using the correct scientific methods. If this policy can be implemented under a single program, a significant portion of the work can be accomplished. I believe that this will be crucial for the agreement made with the International Monetary Fund. Professor Premakumar De Silva of the Department of Sociology at the University of Colombo  There is a significant population of people living in rural areas of our country who are not connected to the global economy. I am interested in conducting research on these individuals. It is crucial to uplift the rural poor under the plan to develop the country. As a middle-class citizen, I am also impacted by the crisis, and we all must make some sacrifices. Moreover, there is a substantial group of young people who are not involved in the economy, and they require professional knowledge and training. While there are several vocational training institutes in the country, their effectiveness is not widely known. We must continue on this journey with self-criticism and a willingness to improve. Professor Shirantha Heenkenda  It appears that the citizens of the country are still hesitant to proceed with taking out loans. As such, it is necessary to provide them with more information about the countrys development plans. We need to create confidence among the people regarding the program of developing the country through loans. If we expect people to be patient for six months, we must have faith in the tax system and ensure that there is transparency in the process. Moreover, there needs to be a discussion about transparency in the loan process to help build trust among the people. We need to provide clear explanations about how the loans will be used to benefit the country and its citizens, which will help alleviate any fears or doubts that people may have. Professor Priyanga Dunusinghe of the Colombo University I appreciate your decisions regarding the countrys economy. As you rightly point out, restructuring the public sector and creating a competitive economy is crucial for our countrys economic development. However, I agree that there are also serious issues with private sector service providers in our country, and that the prices they set can have a significant impact on the economy. In light of this, I fully agree with your request to focus on maintaining the competitiveness of the private sector and preventing market collapse. Borrowing from the International Monetary Fund is a necessary step, but we must also pay attention to finding low-cost sources of credit to minimize the burden on our economy. As for the green economy, I believe that it is an important area for our country to focus on. We must work towards creating sustainable and environmentally friendly industries and promoting clean energy. This will not only help to protect our environment but also create new opportunities for economic growth and development. Kelaniya University Professor Ajith Dissanayake, The implementation of the past economy requires self-criticism. In addition, people have a negative attitude towards borrowing from the International Monetary Fund due to past experiences. The public questions the benefits of previous loans and whether they were properly invested. To address this, it is necessary to focus on creating a positive attitude towards borrowing and demonstrating the effective use of the loans for the betterment of the country. Dr. Indrajith Aponsu  University of Colombo I approach the debate over the International Monetary Fund from two perspectives. First, the challenges that people face as a result of IMF policies, and second, whether the IMFs focus is on addressing our countrys long-term problems. The trade deficit, which was a major component of the balance of payments deficit, increased by more than 90 billion between 2000 and 2020. It is critical to address this issue. Our small and medium-scale enterprises are now of high quality. They can join the value chain if we can get them to innovate and focus on exports. Tourism and remittances are important as well. Peradeniya University Vice Chancellor Professor Mr. M. D. Lamawansa Recognizing the challenges we face, we have made a number of decisions at the university level to reduce waste and eliminate backlogs despite staff shortages. The support provided by the staff and students to cope with this difficult period should also be appreciated. Our current emphasis is on international relations and the recruitment of international students. Currently, we have approximately 50 international students. I am hopeful that we will be able to recruit more students in the coming months. Mr. Anas Cader, South Eastern University  This is the first time weve seen a bottom-up policy approach. It is a very good initiative. Weve all got good ideas. A good first step is to establish an institution where economic experts can develop and implement their ideas and policies. Professor A. Rameez, from the South Eastern University The people of the Eastern Province are optimistic that the President will do something to revitalize the country. The government was able to earn Rs. 100 billion through Payee Tax. On the other hand, losses of SriLankan Airlines and CEB cost the government around Rs. 113-117 billion in eight months. Ceylon Petroleum Corporations annual loss is close to Rs. 600 billion. As a result, there is an urgent need to reform all of the governments enterprises. So, Mr. President, youre on the right track, and I believe the people will back you up as you reform the state-owned enterprise. Vice Chancellor of the Ruhuna University Senior Professor Sujeewa Amarasena  I know that we are not going to have any tax concessions for the next six months and we are okay with that. But all the other academics are on trade union action believing that something will come with the trade union action. But, we know that it is not going to happen. When I asked our side, they have not had a written communication from trade union leaders that negotiations are unsuccessful. So, I think its good to be open and say we are not able to negotiate these proposals for six months, but we definitely promise to discuss these proposals in six months. State Minister of Finance Shehan Semasinghe  This was very clearly communicated that trade union actions will be discussed in six months and we have had different rounds of talks with officials and even the Presidential Secretariat. So, this has been communicated to the Trade Union Leaders but, its sad to see that they are just not willing to understand or they just pretend as if they dont understand. I think thats a sad situation. But, we will broaden the communication. Also, if these trade union leaders dont communicate the proper message, can they be representatives of the trade unions? Finance Ministry Secretary Mahinda Siriwardana  I must admit that some parts of the countrys economy have had a negative impact. Our state finances have suffered a severe collapse, and its clear that decades of old habits cannot be changed overnight. To remedy this, we must adopt fiscal discipline and implement tax policies. Our President has advised us to use technology to expand the tax base, which may only have a temporary effect. However, as government revenue increases, the effect of these policies will gradually fade away. Presidential Senior Adviser on National Security and Chief of Presidential Staff Sagala Ratnayake, Presidential Adviser on Economic Affairs Dr. R.H.S. Samaratunga, and a group of scholars representing the university field attended the event. --PMD--",

        "title": "Finland joins NATO in historic strategic shift while Sweden waits",
        "date": "April 4, 2023 08:37 am",
        "content": "Finland becomes the 31st member of NATO on Tuesday, in a historic strategic shift provoked by Moscows war on Ukraine, which doubles the US-led alliances border with Russia. Last year, the Kremlins all-out invasion of Ukraine upended Europes security landscape and prompted Finland -- and its neighbour Sweden -- to drop decades of non-alignment. Awkward allies Turkey and Hungary, for different reasons of their own, delayed Finlands bid to come under the NATO umbrella -- and Stockholms progress remains blocked. But last week, the Turkish parliament voted to clear Finlands last hurdle. Completing the ratification in well under a year still makes this the fastest membership process in the alliances recent history. All that remained were Tuesdays highly choreographed formalities at NATO headquarters. Finlands foreign minister will hand over the formal accession papers to US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, the keeper of NATO founding treaty. Then the countrys blue-and-white flag will be raised next to those of its new allies, between those of Estonia and France, in front of the gleaming headquarters in Brussels. This is really an historic day. Its a great day for the alliance, NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg said. Joining NATO places Finland under the alliances Article Five, the collective defence pledge that an attack on one member shall be considered an attack against them all. This was the guarantee Finnish leaders decided they needed as they watched Russian President Vladimir Putins devastating assault lay waste to swathes of Ukraine. Putin gets more NATO President Putin went to war against Ukraine with a clear aim to get less NATO, Stoltenberg said. Hes getting the exact opposite. Invaded by its giant neighbour the Soviet Union in 1939, Finland -- which has a 1,300-kilometre (800 mile) border with Russia -- stayed out of NATO throughout the Cold War. Now its membership brings a potent military into the alliance with a wartime strength of 280,000 and one of Europes largest artillery arsenals. And its strategic location bolsters NATOs defences on a border running from the vulnerable Baltic states to the increasingly competitive Arctic. NATO was created as a counterweight to the Soviet Union at the onset of the Cold War era that began immediately after the Allies defeated Nazi Germany. The bloc has gone through waves of expansion that brought it ever closer to Russias borders. NATOs reach into eastern and southern European countries that were once under Moscows effective control infuriated the Kremlin and strained its relations with Washington. Putin cited the threat of NATO expanding into Ukraine as one of his main reasons for launching the war 13 months ago. At first, the Kremlin appeared to play down the significance of the alliances border advancing to touch a new stretch of Russias northwestern frontier. But it has pledged to bolster its forces and stepped up diplomatic rhetoric in recent weeks, describing Finland and Sweden as a legitimate target if they join NATO. Putin has also announced plans to deploy tactical nuclear weapons in Russias neighbour Belarus. Sweden soon? Finlands arrival nevertheless remains a bittersweet moment for the alliance as the hope had been for Sweden to come on board at the same time. Budapest and Ankara remain the holdouts after belatedly agreeing to wave through Helsinkis bid. Sweden has upset Hungarys leader Viktor Orban -- one of Putins closest allies in Europe -- by expressing alarm over the rule of law in Hungary. It has also angered Turkey by refusing to extradite dozens of suspects that President Recep Tayyip Erdogan links to a failed 2016 coup attempt and a decades-long Kurdish independence struggle. NATO diplomats hope Erdogan will become more amenable if he weathers elections in May and that Sweden will join before a NATO summit in Vilnius this July. Source: AFP -Agencies",

        "content": "Power  Energy Minister Kanchana Wijesekera says the three Cabinet-approved foreign oil companies are expected to commence their fuel distribution operations in Sri Lanka within the next two months. Sri Lanka plans to ink respective agreements with the three companies in the coming two weeks, said the lawmaker, who joined the political talk show 360 on TV Derana on Monday night. Last week, the Cabinet of Ministers green-lighted the proposal to grant retail licenses to China-based Sinopec, Australia-based United Petroleum and US-based RM Parks Inc., in collaboration with Shell PLC. The Cabinet approval came after the relevant procurement committees gave their go-ahead and recommendations to award the three companies retail licenses to operate in Sri Lanka. In March, President Ranil Wickremesinghe-led government decided on the divestiture of seven key state-owned enterprises (SOEs) including the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation, SriLankan Airlines, Sri Lanka Telecom. To this end, the government also set up an SOE Restructuring Unit. According to Wijesekera, each company will handle 150 CPC dealer-operated filling stations in the local market. At present, a total of 1,142 filling stations are under the purview of the CPC, however, the corporation fully owns only 234 of them, the minister explained, adding that 450 out of the remaining 908 filling stations owned by private distributors would be allocated to the three foreign oil companies. In addition, these firms will be permitted to establish up to 50 filling stations of their own in the country, Wijesekera said further.",

With this, the agency has closed the investigation into one of the two cases it registered following the death of Angoda Lokka under suspicious circumstances. One case is related to his death and the second case is against the gangsters aides for various charges, including harbouring and arranging forged documents for him during his illegal stay in India. The agencys probe found Angoda Lokka, who lived in a rented house at Balaji Nagar near Cheran Ma Nagar in India under the assumed identity of Pradeep Singh for around two years, died after suffering a heart attack on the night of July 03, 2020. A Sri Lankan woman, Amani Thanji, was staying with Angoda Lokka when he suffered chest pain. Thanji, with the help of neighbours, rushed Angoda Lokka to a private hospital where doctors declared him dead. The body was later shifted to the Coimbatore Medical College Hospital for post-mortem. Thanji, and two others, a Madurai-based advocate D. Sivakamasundari and her friend S. Dyaneswaran of Erode, took the body of Angoda Lokka to Madurai after the post-mortem and cremated it there on July 05 that year. The actual identity of the deceased came to light after the Coimbatore City Police found the aadhaar card in the name of Pradeep Singh, a copy of which Sivakamasundari produced at the Peelamedu police station, had been obtained using forged documents. The police arrested Thanji, Sivakamasundari and Dyaneswaran on August 02 and the CB-CID later took over the investigation, by registering two cases. A CB-CID official said the investigation into a second case against eight persons including Thanji, Sivakamasundari and Dyaneswaran was continuing. Source: The Hindu -Agencies",
