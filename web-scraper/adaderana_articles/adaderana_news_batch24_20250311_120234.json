        "content": "Cabinet Spokesman Minister Nalinda Jayatissa has confirmed that vehicle permits will not be provided to Members of Parliament under the incumbent government and that however there are plans to provide them with a vehicle to help carry out their duties. Responding to a question during the Cabinet press briefing, he stated today (05), Our government will not issue vehicle permits to MPs. There is a plan for the government to provide a vehicle for MPs to carry out their duties. After their five-year term ends, the vehicle must be returned. He further continued, There is no time now to build a pool of vehicles to provide non-super luxury vehicles. However, given the economic situation in the country, we have no intention of importing vehicles for MPs. Our priority is not vehicles for MPs. When pressed again by a journalist to clarify as to whether or not the government will provide vehicles to MPs, the minister replied: The government will not provide vehicles for MPs. He further commented on the relaxing of restriction imposed on vehicles imports saying, It is only after five years that our government has decided to grant some permissions for the import of vehicles. We are now restructuring the economy. In line with that, we have granted limited permission for vehicle imports. He added that the government is cautiously allowing vehicle imports, considering the potential impact it could pose on the countrys foreign reserves. He also noted that vehicle imports cannot be completely opened at the outset. A debate is also taking place in Parliament regarding a Gazette notification related to this, he added.",

        "date": "February 5, 2025 04:13 pm",
        "content": "Philippine Vice President Sara Duterte was impeached by the House of Representatives Wednesday after more than the required number of legislators, many of them allies of the president with whom she has had a bitter political feud, signed a petition to remove her from office. House of Representatives Secretary General Reginald Velasco told a plenary meeting of the lower chamber of Congress that at least 215 lawmakers have signed a petition to impeach Duterte, more than enough for the powerful House to impeach her. With enough endorsements by House legislators, the impeachment complaint was ordered transmitted to the Senate, which will serve as an impeachment tribunal that would try the vice president, the daughter of former President Rodrigo Duterte. The vice president, who didnt immediately react to the House move to impeach her, and her father have been politically at odds with President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. and his camp, including a majority of House legislators. The vice president, regarded as a possible presidential candidate after Marcoss term ends in 2028, has faced at least four impeachment complaints by several legislators and left-wing activist groups over a range of issues. Those included a death threat she made against the president, his wife and House Speaker Martin Romualdez last year, irregularities in the use of her offices intelligence funds and her failure to stand up to Chinese aggression in the disputed South China Sea. Only the latest impeachment complaint, accusing the vice president of violating the constitution, betraying the public trust, corruption and other high crimes, and signed by the 215 legislators would be sent to the Senate for her trial, according to legislators. Efforts to impeach the vice president may be hampered by a lack of time. The House impeachment came on the last day of congressional session before campaigning begins for midterm elections in May that would select new legislators for the House and Senate. A special session could be called to allow the Senate to bring Duterte to a rapid trial. The vice presidents legal troubles have unfolded with the backdrop of her increasingly bitter political feud with the president and his allies. She said in online news conference on Nov. 23 that she has contracted an assassin to kill Marcos, his wife and Speaker Martin Romualdez if she were killed, a threat she warned wasnt a joke. She later said that she wasnt threatening him, but was expressing concern for her own safety. The House has been investigating the alleged misuse of 612.5 million pesos (10.3 million) of confidential and intelligence funds received by Dutertes offices as vice president and education secretary. She has since left the education post after her political differences with Marcos deepened. She has refused to respond to questions in detail in tense televised hearings last year. Duterte also vehemently protested when her chief of staff, Zuleika Lopez, was ordered temporarily detained for allegedly hampering the inquiry. Lopez has since been released from hospital detention. Duterte has accused Marcos, his wife and Romualdez of corruption, weak leadership and attempting to muzzle her because of speculation she may seek the presidency in 2028. The National Bureau of Investigation subpoenaed Duterte last year to face investigators about her threats against them. The police, military and the national security adviser immediately boosted the security of the Marcos family after the threats. Marcos and Duterte won landslide victories as running mates in the 2022 election, but have since fallen out over key differences. The two offices are elected separately in the Philippines, which has resulted in rivals occupying the countrys top political posts. Marcos and Duterte differ on their approaches to Chinas territorial claims in the South China Sea and their views on the deadly anti-drug crackdown conducted by Dutertes father, who was the previous president and an ex-mayor of Davao. The brutal drug crackdown by her father left thousands of mostly poor suspects dead in killings mostly by police that are being investigated by the International Criminal Court as a possible crime against humanity.

        "content": "Australia has banned DeepSeek from all government devices over concerns that the Chinese artificial intelligence startup poses security risks, the government said on Tuesday. The Secretary of the Department of Home Affairs issued a mandatory direction for all government entities to prevent the use or installation of DeepSeek products, applications and web services and where found remove all existing instances of DeepSeek products, applications and web services from all Australian Government systems and devices, the statement said. Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke said DeepSeek posed an unacceptable risk to government technology and the immediate ban was to protect Australias national security and national interest, several Australian media outlets reported on Tuesday evening. The ban does not extend to devices of private citizens. Tech stocks worldwide plunged after the launch of DeepSeek last month - apparently costing a fraction of rival AI models and requiring less sophisticated chips - raised questions over the Wests huge investments in chipmakers and data centres. Australias decision to ban Deepseek follows similar action in Italy, while other countries in Europe and elsewhere are also looking into the AI firm.

        "date": "February 5, 2025 05:17 pm",
        "content": "The Taliban suspended the operation of Afghanistans only womens radio station after raiding its premises on Tuesday, deepening the exclusion of women from public life and society since the group took power in 2021. Kabul-based Radio Begum  a station run by women with content aimed at womens education  said officers from the Talibans information and culture ministry restrained the stations staff as it searched its premises in the nations capital. Officers seized computers, hard drives, files and phones from Begum staff, including Begum female journalists, and took into custody two male employees of the organization who do not hold any senior management position, the station said in a statement on Tuesday. The ministry later confirmed the stations suspension, citing several alleged violations of broadcasting policy and improper use of the stations license, including the unauthorized provision of content and programming to a foreign-based television channel. It did not identify the foreign TV channel in question, but said it will determine the stations future in due course. Reporters Without Borders (RSF), an independent rights group, condemned the suspension and demanded its immediate reversal. Before Tuesdays ban, Radio Begum broadcast six hours of lessons a day, along with health, psychology and spiritual programs to women across most of Afghanistan. The station said it provides education to Afghan girls and support to Afghan women, without being involved in any political activity whatsoever. Its sister channels also offer lessons online filmed in studios thousands of miles away in Paris. The televised classes cover a wider array of subjects, providing education in a country where girls are banned from school after sixth grade. Tightening the grip The Taliban, a radical Islamist group not recognized by most countries around the world, has been tightening its grip on the media landscape since its takeover more than three years ago. Initially presenting itself as more moderate than during its previous rule of Afghanistan in the 1990s, it even promised that women would be allowed to continue their education up to university. But it has since cracked down instead, closing secondary schools for girls; banning women from attending university, working in most sectors and at NGOs, including the United Nations; restricting their travel without a male chaperone; and banning them from public spaces such as parks and gyms. Last year, the Taliban closed at least 12 media outlets, both public and private, according to RSF, which ranked Afghanistan 178 out of 180 countries in its latest press freedom index. The Islamist regime also banned the sound of womens voices in public  including singing, reciting, or reading aloud  under a strict set of vice and virtue laws that made it even harder for Radio Begum to reach its female audience.

        "date": "February 6, 2025 06:50 am",
        "content": "The Trump administration announced that all USAID direct hire personnel will be placed on administrative leave globally with effect from the 07 February 2025. The announcement raised concerns that this action will significantly affect humanitarian aid initiatives worldwide. Meanwhile, expressing views in this regard, Cabinet Spokesperson, Minister Dr. Nalinda Jayatissa vowed that government will continue USAID-funded projects in Sri Lanka with alternative sources of funding. Responding to a question raised by a journalist during the Cabinet press conference, Dr. Jayatissa noted: If our government had made this decision, I could have responded. Lets see how this works out for us. We will have to find alternatives if they withdraw foreign aid. Sri Lanka does not operate on the funds received from USAID. It is good if they can grant funds to us. However, if not, we will continue these beneficial projects through the funds obtained through other sources, the Minister added. Established in 1961, the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) is an independent establishment put in place to administer humanitarian aid programs around the world on behalf of the U.S. government. However, on the first day of his second term in office, U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order freezing foreign aid for at least 90 days. Trump, who is a long-term critic of overseas spending, has said it does not represent value for money for American taxpayers. Against this backdrop, U.S. officials revealed that USAID will be merged with the State Department and will have significant cuts in the workforce but will remain a humanitarian aid entity. Meanwhile, USAID announced yesterday (06) that all USAID direct hire personnel will be placed on administrative leave globally with effect from Friday, the 7th of February, with the exception of designated personnel responsible for mission-critical functions, core leadership, and specially designated programs. The notice further stated that the agency is working with the State Department on a plan to arrange and pay for USAID personnel stationed abroad to return to the United States within 30 days. USAID employs more than 10,000 people, about two-thirds of whom are stationed overseas. In the 2023 fiscal year, the United States disbursed 72 billion U.S. dollars of aid worldwide for causes ranging from womens health in conflict zones to access to clean water, HIVAIDS treatments, energy security and anti-corruption work. USAID has spent billions of dollars on the development of agriculture, health, education, business development, trade, human rights and good governance in Sri Lanka during the past decades. However, the move to shut it down will have a profound impact on USAID projects in Sri Lanka.",

        "content": "At least 104 Indian citizens were deported from the United States Tuesday night on a military aircraft, according to officials from Indias Punjab state, as US President Donald Trump makes stemming migration a top priority. The C-17 aircraft, carrying migrants mainly from Indias Gujarat, Maharashtra and Punjab states, landed Wednesday afternoon local time in the northwest city of Amritsar, Punjab officials said. It marked the longest distance flight since the Trump administration began deploying military aircraft for migrant transportation, according to a US official. Friends and family of some of the returnees told CNN of the hardships the deportees faced to get to the US, only for them to be sent back soon after arrival. Manriasat Singh, whose 23-year-old cousin Akashdeep Singh was among those on the deportation flight, told CNN that Akashdeep sounded low. Akashdeep left for the US seven months ago, spending nearly 60,000 for the journey that his father had acquired by selling two-thirds of their land, his cousin told CNN. Shortly after Akashdeeps arrival to the US in January, he was detained and deported from there, his cousin said. His parents are happy that he has not spent ten years in jail and is returning. At least he is alive, Manriasat added. The youth want to live a good life Akashdeeps story is not unique. In just four years, the number of Indian citizens entering the US illegally has surged dramatically  from 8,027 in the 2018 to 2019 fiscal year to 96,917 during 2022 to 2023 period, government data showed. Young Indians looking for work opportunities have made up a sizeable portion of undocumented migrants in the US, some of whom are making the dangerous trek through Latin America to reach the US southern border. Lakbhir Singh, a former Punjab village leader, knows one of the deported Indian citizens. He said the repatriated mans family is distraught. The family had sold their property and spent thousands of dollars to send their son abroad and the boy came back, Lakbhir said. He said unemployment was driving young people in his area to leave. The youth want to live a good life, he said. The government should do something about it, instead of flashing their names and villages on television. They should deal with the problem at the core of it. While the Indian government has announced their intent to receive its deported citizens back, local leaders are calling for greater measures to be taken to address the root of the problem. This is my request to the federal government, the Punjab State Minister of Non-resident Indian Affairs, Kuldeep Singh Dhaliwal, said to local media on Wednesday after meeting the deported individuals.

        "content": "A surge in fraudulent job advertisements using the logos of government institutions has raised concerns over personal data theft, according to cybersecurity experts. Senior Information Security Engineer at the Sri Lanka Computer Emergency Response Team (SLCERT), Charuka Damunupola, revealed that multiple cases have been reported in recent days, with scammers luring unsuspecting individuals through fake government job postings on social media. Meanwhile, the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) has issued an official warning regarding a fraudulent advertisement circulating online that falsely claims to offer job opportunities under its name. The CBSL clarified that the advertisement is entirely fake and urged the public to be vigilant. Similarly, recent scams have involved job advertisements misusing the logo of SriLankan Airlines, further emphasizing the growing trend of cyber fraud. Damunupola cautioned that responding to such deceptive advertisements could result in identity theft. These scams often aim to steal personal information, including copies of national identity cards, passports, and birth certificates, through fake websites. Under no circumstances should individuals share their personal data on unverified platforms, he advised. Authorities urge the public to verify job postings directly through official websites and refrain from engaging with suspicious advertisements to protect themselves from potential fraud.",

Nandana Thilake stated that as a result , salt prices in the local market will see a slight increase. However, he assured that this price hike will be reversed by March 2025, once salt imports are halted. The first shipment, consisting of 1,485 metric tons of salt imported from India, arrived in Sri Lanka on January 27 to address the countrys salt shortage. This marks the first time in 15 years that Sri Lanka has imported salt for general consumption. The decision to import salt was driven by severe adverse weather conditions that negatively impacted the local salt industry, leading to a shortfall in meeting national consumption demands. To mitigate the shortage, the Cabinet of Ministers approved the import of 30,000 metric tons of salt to ensure an adequate supply. The government has confirmed that salt imports from India will continue until February 28, 2025.",

        "title": "US officials now say Trump only wants to displace Palestinians from Gaza temporarily",
        "date": "February 6, 2025 09:26 am",
        "content": "President Donald Trumps top diplomat and his main spokesperson on Wednesday walked back the idea that he wants the permanent relocation of Palestinians from Gaza, after American allies and even Republican lawmakers rebuffed his suggestion that the U.S. take ownership of the territory. Trump on Tuesday had called for permanently resettling Palestinians from war-torn Gaza and left open the door to deploying American troops there as part of a massive rebuilding operation. But Secretary of State Marco Rubio and White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said he only sought to move the roughly 1.8 million Gazans temporarily to allow for reconstruction. Even that proposal has drawn criticism from Palestinians, who are worried they may never be allowed back in if they flee, and from the Arab nations that Trump has called on to take them in. Rubio, on his first foreign trip as secretary of state, described Trumps proposal as a very generous offer to help with debris removal and reconstruction of the enclave following 15 months of fighting between Israel and Hamas. In the interim, obviously people are going to have to live somewhere while youre rebuilding it, Rubio said in a news conference in Guatemala City. Leavitt said in a briefing with reporters in Washington that Gaza is a demolition site and referenced footage of the devastation. The president has made it clear that they need to be temporarily relocated out of Gaza, she said, calling it currently an uninhabitable place for human beings and saying it would be evil to suggest that people should live in such dire conditions. Their comments contradicted Trump, who said Tuesday night, If we can get a beautiful area to resettle people, permanently, in nice homes where they can be happy and not be shot and not be killed and not be knifed to death like whats happening in Gaza. He added that he envisioned long-term U.S. ownership of a redevelopment of the territory, which sits along the Mediterranean Sea. In a meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the Pentagon on Wednesday, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said the military is prepared to look at all options for rebuilding Gaza. We look forward to working with our allies, our counterparts, both diplomatically and militarily, to look at all options, Hegseth said. In an interview later Wednesday with Fox News Sean Hannity, Netanyahu reiterated his praise for Trump: Its a remarkable idea and I think it should be really pursued. Examined, pursued and done, because I think it will create a different future for everyone. Egypt, Jordan and other U.S. allies in the Mideast have cautioned Trump that relocating Palestinians from Gaza would threaten Mideast stability, risk expanding the conflict and undermine a decades-long push by the U.S. and its allies for a two-state solution. Saudi Arabias foreign ministry issued a sharply worded reaction to Trump, noting its long call for an independent Palestinian state was a firm, steadfast and unwavering position. Saudi Arabia has been in negotiations with the U.S. over a deal to diplomatically recognize Israel in exchange for a security pact and other terms. The duty of the international community today is to work to alleviate the severe human suffering endured by the Palestinian people, who will remain committed to their land and will not budge from it, the Saudi statement said. Even Sen. Lindsey Graham, a Republican and a Trump ally, called it problematic. The idea of Americans going in on the ground in Gaza is a non starter for every senator, the South Carolina lawmaker told reporters Wednesday. So I would suggest we go back to what weve been trying to do which is destroy Hamas and find a way for the Arab world to take over Gaza and the West Bank, in a fashion that would lead to a Palestinian state that Israel can live with. Rubio insisted that Trumps position was not meant as a hostile move. What hes very generously has offered is the ability of the United States to go in and help with debris removal, help with munitions removal, help with reconstruction, the rebuilding homes and businesses and things of this nature so that then people can move back in, Rubio said. Still, the White House said Trump was ruling out sending U.S. dollars to aid in the reconstruction of Gaza. But Leavitt, like Trump, refused to rule out sending American troops into Gaza, saying of Trump, he wants to preserve that leverage in negotiations. The Palestinians, Arab nations and others have rejected even a temporary relocation from Gaza, which would run counter to decades of U.S. policy calling for the creation of a Palestinian state with no further displacement of Palestinians from Gaza or the West Bank. The proposals also appear to trash months of negotiations by the Biden administration to draft a day after plan for the reconstruction and governance of Gaza. President Joe Biden had tried to lock in that plan  which calls for joint governance of the territory by the Palestinian Authority under U.N. stewardship and a multi-national peacekeeping force  before leaving office by inviting Trumps main Mideast envoy into final talks over a Gaza ceasefire.

        "date": "February 6, 2025 11:01 am",
        "content": "The Supreme Court has decided to support on 19 March 2025, the Fundamental Rights (FR) petition filed by former President Mahinda Rajapaksas lawyers urging for the redeployment of his removed security detail, Ada Derana reporter said. This petition was taken up before a three-member Supreme Court judge bench comprising Justices Preethi Padman Surasena, Janak de Silva and Sampath Abeykoon today (06). Appearing for the respondents of the case, Additional Solicitor General Varunika Hettige requested the court for time to obtain instructions related to the case from the respondents and to file objections to the petition. Accordingly, the court allowed the responding party to file objections related to the case and also asked the petitioning party to file counter-objections, if required. Presidents Counsel Ali Sabry, who appeared for the petitioner Mahinda Rajapaksa, presented evidence before the court and claimed that the security of his client had been reduced without any proper security assessment. The Presidents Counsel also stated before the court that a decision on reducing or increasing the former presidents security should be taken after a formal security assessment. Accordingly, the three-judge Supreme Court bench, which considered the facts presented, ordered that the relevant petition be called on March 19 to confirm the facts. On January 24, ex-President Mahinda Rajapaksas attorneys filed a fundamental rights (FR) petition with the Supreme Court seeking an order for the deployment of his security detail which had been reduced. Prime Minister Dr. Harini Amarasuriya and other members of the Cabinet of Ministers have been named as respondents in the petition. The petition alleges that the security detail provided for his protection has been reduced to 60 personnel, without a proper security assessment. The petition further states that presently no armed forces security personnel have been deployed for his protection and that only police officers have been provided for his protection. In his petition, the former President says that as the leader who provided leadership to end the war that lasted for almost three decades in the country, he is facing terrorist threats and that there have also been threats to his life. The petitioner therefore requested the court to deliver an order that the respondents had violated his fundamental human rights by arbitrarily removing his protection. In addition, he requests that an order be issued to the respondents to conduct an assessment of the threats against him. Rajapaksa has also requested the Supreme Court to issue an order to the respondents to redeploy the entire security detail provided to him, which has now been withdrawn.",

        "date": "February 6, 2025 12:55 pm",
        "content": "Australian scientists have produced the worlds first kangaroo embryo through in vitro fertilisation (IVF), a breakthrough they say could help save other species from extinction. Using specimens from eastern grey kangaroos, the researchers successfully injected a single sperm cell into an egg, but said achieving a live birth would require more work and technical advancements. The feat provides important insights into marsupial breeding and could aid efforts to improve the genetic diversity of endangered species such as the koala, Tasmanian devil, northern hairy-nosed wombat and Leadbeaters possum, lead researcher Andres Gambini said. Australia houses the largest variety of marsupial mammals, but it also has the highest rate of mammal extinctions. The University of Queensland experiment looked at the growth of kangaroo eggs and sperm in a laboratory setting before creating embryos using a method known as intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). The technique, which is already used on humans and some domestic animals, was tried on eastern grey kangaroos that had died. The species was selected because it is not endangered and has existing high populations. Despite how iconic marsupial species are in Australia and the crucial role they play in its biodiversity, studies into their tissues have been limited, scientists say. We are now refining techniques to collect, culture and preserve marsupial eggs and sperm, said Dr Gambini, adding that such methods would play a crucial role in safeguarding the genetic material of these unique and precious animals. IVF is being used as a tool to try and preserve endangered species the world over. Last year, scientists achieved the worlds first IVF rhino pregnancy, successfully transferring a lab-created rhino embryo into a surrogate mother in Kenya. In 2018, IVF was also used to create the worlds first donkey embryo. Source: BBC --Agencies",

        "content": "Ozzy Osbourne has announced that the original members of Black Sabbath will play a concert together for the first time in 20 years. In a post on X, Osbourne revealed that he would reunite with Tony Iommi, Geezer Butler and Bill Ward to play one final show at Villa Park in Birmingham, England on July 5. Its my time to go Back to the Beginning time for me to give back to the place where I was born, said Osbourne. How blessed am I to do it with the help of people whom I love. Birmingham is the true home of metal. Birmingham Forever. Osbourne will play his own short set in the multi-artist show before joining with the band for his final bow, the announcement said. Other musicians performing at Back to the Beginning include Metallica, Slayer, Lamb of God, Alice in Chains and Anthrax. This will be the greatest heavy metal show ever, the post quoted the concerts music director, Tom Morello, as saying. Formed in Birmingham in 1968, Black Sabbath went on to become one of the most successful metal bands of all time, selling more than 75 million albums worldwide, according to Osbournes post. Back in 2022, he surprised attendees at the Birmingham Commonwealth Games with a mini Black Sabbath reunion, rocking out on stage with Iommi. Though Osbourne had a farewell tour set to begin in 2023, he was forced to cancel the shows due to poor health. My singing voice is fine. However, after three operations, stem cell treatments, endless physical therapy, and most recently groundbreaking Cybernics (HAL) Treatment, my body is still physically weak, he said in a statement at the time. Osbourne, 76, later told Rolling Stone that he would die a happy man if he could perform in one more show to express his gratitude to fans from the stage. His wife, Sharon Osbourne, hinted at the upcoming concert in an interview with Rolling Stone last year, telling the magazine that Osbourne was ready to give his fans a sendoff in his hometown. Tickets for the concert go on sale February 14, with profits going to various charities. Source: CNN --Agencies",

        "date": "February 6, 2025 01:04 pm",
        "content": "The family of a young British influencer who died suddenly on the holiday of a lifetime to Sri Lanka are inconsolable, a friend has said. Ebony McIntosh, 24, was rushed to hospital on Saturday after reportedly being poisoned by pesticides used to kill bed bugs at the hostel where she was staying. She, and another guest from Germany, died just hours later after being treated for vomiting, nausea and breathing difficulties. A friend of Ebonys mum Chandrika Patel said: The family are completely devastated and inconsolable. They are beyond grief. She was their life. Ebony was the eldest of four daughters and still lived at the family home in Mickleover, Derbyshire. One neighbour, who did not want to be named, said: She was a lovely girl. She has lived here since she was about three and Ive watched her grow up. What happened is heartbreaking and everyone is very shocked. I only found out this morning after my son told me about the fundraiser. I cant imagine what her poor parents and sisters are going through. I saw her before she went off on her trip, not to chat to but to wave to. Ebony had only left the UK for Sri Lanka on January 28, and it was her first stop on a tour of South Asia having spent months planning and researching the trip. The exact cause of Ebonys death is not known and a post-mortem examination is due to take place to establish the circumstances surrounding it. But reports in Sri Lanka suggest that Ebony and the unnamed German woman may have been poisoned by noxious pesticides intended to treat bed bugs in an adjacent room 72 hours before she collapsed. The German woman is understood to have stayed in the same room as Ebony at the Miracle Colombo City hostel in the Sri Lankan capital - which has now been shut down by investigators. Ebonys younger sister India posted a moving tribute to her on social media, writing: To my Ebony, my beautiful sister, thank you, thank you for being my older sister, one better than I couldve ever asked for. She added: I want you home now tho sis pls come back! It would only be you that would go out living your best life in sri lankaI am truly heartbroken, I cant believe I am writing this, it feels like some nightmare I havent woken up from yet, we will get justice for you, you had so much life left to live. She ends her post by saying: My heart aches I need you here, we all need you. Lets get you home Ebony. Ebony had 10,000 followers on Instagram and regularly posted about fashion and her travels around the world. India has also launched a GoFundMe page to help her devastated family travel to Sri Lanka and bring her sisters body home. More than 20,000 of the 22,000 target has already been raised. India writes on the fundraising page: On Tuesday January 28, 2025, Ebony flew from Heathrow to follow her dreams of travelling all over South Asia, starting in Sri Lanka. She was full of excitement for her adventures ahead, in typical Ebony style she had spent months researching and planning and drawing up schedules for the coming months. Her trip was cruelly cut short on Saturday 1 February, when she took very ill in the hostel she was staying in. Her and several others were rushed to hospital to be treated for vomiting, nausea and in Ebonys case, difficulty in breathing. She sadly and tragically passed away on February 1 within a few hours of arriving at the hospital, they couldnt save our beautiful girl. She passed away with someone from the hostel beside her. We are endlessly grateful to this man for staying with her during her last moments. The authorities in Sri Lanka are not allowed to release Ebony to us until a full post-mortem has been completed. There is also an ongoing investigation because of the tragic circumstances linked to how she died. We are desperate and cannot wait any longer to see her and to bring her home. We are raising money for flight costs, hotel accommodation, emergency passports, vaccinations, visas and funeral services to give her the best send off that she deserves. We need to be with our beautiful Ebony as soon as possible, we hate the thought of her being alone in a foreign country. We want to be able to bring her back home safely to rest. We just need to look after our angel. Ebony is among a series of backpackers who have suddenly died in recent months, UKs Daily Mail reported. Source: Daily Mail --Agencies",

        "date": "February 6, 2025 01:12 pm",
        "content": "Thousands of protesters set fire to the home of Bangladeshs founding leader, as his daughter, ousted former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina delivered a fiery social media speech calling on her supporters to stand against the interim government. Witnesses said several thousand protesters, some armed with sticks, hammers, and other tools, gathered around the historic house and independence monument, while others brought a crane and excavator to demolish the building. The rally was organised alongside a broader call, dubbed Bulldozer Procession, to disrupt Hasinas scheduled 9 p.m. online address on Wednesday. Protesters, many aligned with the Students Against Discrimination group, had expressed their fury over Hasinas speech, which they viewed as a challenge to the newly formed interim government. Tensions have been escalating in Bangladesh since August 2024, when mass protests forced Hasina to flee to neighbouring India. The interim government, led by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus, has struggled to maintain control as protests and unrest have continued. Demonstrators have attacked symbols of Hasinas government, including the house of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, which was first set ablaze in August. A symbol of the countrys establishment, the house is where Bangabandhu (friend of Bengal), as he is popularly known, declared Bangladeshs independence from Pakistan in 1971. A few years later it became the site of a national tragedy. Mujibur Rahman and most of his family were assassinated at the house in 1975. Hasina, who survived the attack, later transformed the building into a museum dedicated to her fathers legacy. They can demolish a building, but not the history. History takes its revenge, Hasina said in her speech on Wednesday. She urged the people of Bangladesh to stand against the interim government, accusing them of seizing power in an unconstitutional manner. The student-led movement behind the protests has voiced plans to dismantle the countrys 1972 Constitution, which they argue embodies the legacy of her fathers rule. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "content": "Ahimsa Wickrematunge, the daughter of slain journalist Lasantha Wickrematunge has called for the impeachment of Sri Lankas Attorney General Parinda Ranasinghe over alleged gross abuse of power and neglect of duty in connection with the criminal proceedings on her fathers assassination. In a letter to the Prime Minister Dr. Harini Amarasuriya, she expressed concerns over the Attorney Generals recommendation to discharge three individuals who had been named as suspects in the case filed at the Mount Lavinia Magistrates Court over the inquiry into the former Sunday Leader Editors murder. Ahimsa Wickrematunge, who expressed gratitude to the government for its swift announcement that it will review the decision despite the political risks stemming from the NPPs pledge to foster a criminal justice system independent of political interference, noted that she fears that the government believes that applying pressure on Mr. Ranasinghe to reverse his decision will be a sufficient solution. Furthermore, Ms. Wickrematunge has highlighted a number of facts surrounding the death of Lasantha Wickrematunge and claims that Parinda Ranasinghe is no longer fit to serve as Attorney General, as he was either aware or not aware of those facts when he made his decision, and also accused him of being guilty of gross neglect of duty. She also noted: My family is fortunate that my fathers career and reputation resulted in this matter receiving wide publicity and public outcry. But if the Attorney General could act so callously in such a high-profile matter, I cannot imagine the anguish suffered by ordinary people who rely on Mr. Ranasinghe to lead the publics efforts to bring criminals to account. I could not be more grateful to President Anura Kumara Dissanayake for his ceaseless attempts to hold the Attorney General to account. However, it should not be the job of the head of state to brandish a fire extinguisher and chase behind an Attorney General who is running around with a box of matches. The Attorney General is responsible to Parliament. The only way to fulfill the governments pledge to repair the justice system is to impeach him before Parliament and seek his removal from office, she added.",

        "content": "The Lanka Salt Company in Hambantota has announced an increase in salt prices, attributing the hike to the rising cost of imported salt. According to the company, the price of a 400-gram packet of salt powder has been raised by Rs. 20, from Rs. 100 to Rs. 120, while the price of a one-kilogram packet of crystal salt has increased by Rs. 60, from Rs. 120 to Rs. 180. However, the company clarified that this price adjustment is only a temporary measure. Sri Lankas annual salt demand stands at approximately 20,000 metric tons. However, adverse weather conditions in the final quarter of last year led to a decline in local salt production. In response, the government approved the temporary importation of 12,000 metric tons of salt from India to meet the shortfall. Despite this, the State Trading Corporation has assured that salt imports will not be a long-term solution. Local salt production is set to resume at the Hambantota Salt Works by March, ensuring a steady domestic supply. The Hambantota Salt Company has also assured that prices will be reduced once the new harvest becomes available. Currently, the Hambantota Salt Works accounts for 50 of the countrys salt production, with the Paranthan and Puttalam Salt Works also contributing to the national supply.",

Accordingly, the appeals were ordered to be taken up for consideration on August 25, 2025. This order was issued when the case was taken up before the three-member Supreme Court judge bench comprising Justices Preethi Padman Surasena, Janak de Silva and Sampath Abeykoon today (Feb. 06). On September 27, 2017, the Jaffna High Court, which heard the case filed over the abduction, gang rape and murder of 18-year-old schoolgirl Sivaloganathan Vidya, gave the death penalty to the 07 accused including the chief suspect in the case Swiss Kumar. Delivering the much-anticipated verdict after the widely publicised trial came to an end, the three-member judge bench had sentenced the 07 suspects to death and also ordered them to pay Rs. 1 million as compensation to the victims family. In addition to the death penalty, the suspects were also sentenced to a further 30 years in prison. Sivaloganathan Vidya, an 18-year-old schoolgirl from Punkudutivu, was abducted, gang-raped and murdered in Jaffna, while returning home from school on May 13, 2015. However, the appealing party has sought an order from the Supreme Court declaring that the relevant sentences have been imposed in violation of the law and seeking to acquit them of the charges.",

The former MP has since fled the area, and as a result, the investigating officers have been unable to record a statement from him regarding the vehicle in question. A division of the IAD had reportedly received information that former MP Shantha Abeysekara was using an illegally assembled luxury vehicle. Accordingly, after investigating the relevant information for several days, a team of officers were dispatched to Puttalam this morning (6) to seize the vehicle. However, the vehicle could not be located, and further investigation have revealed that it had been disassembled and hidden in two separate locations. Parts of the vehicle were concealed in a coconut plantation land in Puttalam owned by the former MP and in another house near his residence. The chassis and body parts of the vehicle were found hidden in the nearby house, while several more vehicle parts, including the engine, were discovered in the aforementioned property. Further investigations have revealed that the vehicle had been registered using the engine and chassis numbers of a vehicle already currently used by the Department of Agriculture. It was also revealed that the vehicle used by the former MP had these numbers engraved on it. It has been also revealed that former MP Shantha Abeysekara and his son had disassembled and hidden the vehicle after police recently seized several illegally assembled vehicles. Police stated that although they attempted to record a statement from the former MP yesterday (05) regarding this matter, he had already fled the area and remains in hiding.",

The Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines confirmed the crash of a light plane in Maguindanao del Sur province. It did not immediately provide other details. The plane that crashed in the southern province was contracted by the U.S. military, U.S. Embassy spokesperson Kanishka Gangopadhyay told The Associated Press, adding that the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command will issue a more detailed statement on the plane crash. The bodies of four people who appeared to be foreign nationals were retrieved from the wreckage in Ampatuan town, said Ameer Jehad Tim Ambolodto, a safety officer of Maguindanao del Sur. Windy Beaty, a provincial disaster-mitigation officer, told the AP that she received reports that residents saw smoke coming from the plane and heard an explosion before the aircraft plummeted to the ground less than a kilometer (about half a mile) from a cluster of farmhouses. Nobody was reported injured on or near the crash site, which was cordoned off by troops, Beaty said. A water buffalo on the ground was also killed as a result of the plane crash, local officials said. U.S. forces have been deployed in a Philippine military camp in the countrys south for decades to help provide advise and training to Filipino forces battling Muslim militants.

        "date": "February 7, 2025 07:36 am",
        "content": "Taking a significant step towards transforming the country into a digital society, three new digital initiatives will be introduced today (07) at the Presidential Secretariat under the patronage of President Anura Kumara Dissanayake. The initiatives include the launch of the GovPay platform for the digitalization of all government payments, expanding the services of the Presidents Fund from the main office in Colombo to the Divisional Secretariat level, and the introduction of the Electronic Birth, Marriage, and Death Certificates (EBMD) facility, allowing Sri Lankans abroad to obtain certified copies of birth, marriage, and death certificates through electronic means at Sri Lankan diplomatic missions. These services will be available starting today, the Presidents Media Division (PMD) said. A media briefing regarding this was held yesterday (06) at the Presidential Media Centre (PMC), with the presence of Deputy Minister of Digital Economy, Engineer Eranga Weeraratne. The session was attended by senior officials, including Secretary of the Presidents Fund and the Senior Additional Secretary to the President, Roshan Gamage, Additional Secretary of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, M.K. Padmanadan; Chairman of the Information and Communication Technology Agency of Sri Lanka (ICTA), Director Harsha Purasinghe and Chief Executive Officer of Lanka Pay, Channa De Silva. Speaking at the briefing, Deputy Minister Engineer Eranga Weeraratne stated that, following the guidance of President Anura Kumar Disanayake, these new digital approaches have been introduced as part of the governments efforts to realize the vision of transitioning the country towards a digital society. The Deputy Minister pointed out that cash-based payment fraud and corruption have led to increased inefficiencies in transaction processes. To address these challenges, the government is taking steps to digitize all government payments, the PMD mentioned. Furthermore, the Deputy Minister highlighted that promoting digital payments would provide the public with more convenient and trustworthy services. The Presidents Fund, which started in 1978, has previously accepted applications only at the main office in Colombo. However, starting tomorrow, the services will be available at 341 regional secretariat offices across the country. Under the supervision of the Divisional Secretaries, a trained staff will carry out these registrations using new technology, stated Secretary of the Presidents Fund and the Senior Additional Secretary to the President, Roshan Gamage. The Senior Additional Secretary further stated that this initiative will not only bring the services of the Presidents Fund closer to the public but will also ensure that those who are entitled to these services will receive them appropriately, it added. The current government policy towards Sri Lankans abroad includes providing efficient and convenient services through diplomatic missions. In line with this, the electronic method (EBMD) to obtain birth, marriage, and death certificates through the consular services will begin tomorrow under the patronage of the President, said the Additional Secretary of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, M.K. Padmanadan. He further stated that instead of the out-dated methods for obtaining birth, marriage, and death certificates, electronic technology will now connect consular offices to the Registrar Generals Departments data system, enabling copies of certificates to be issued directly from the consulate. This new process will be implemented starting today. Addressing the briefing Harsha Purasinghe, the Chairman of the Information and Communication Technology Agency of Sri Lanka (ICTA) stated that detailed information regarding the state institutions offering the GovPay service will be available on the www.GovPay.lk website after 12 noon today (07). This digitalization process will be a continuous effort, with the final goal of digitizing all government service, according to the PMD.",

He emphasized that this shift presents an opportunity for Sri Lanka to challenge the previous resolution brought against the island nation at the 58th session of the UNHRC, set to commence on February 24. Dr. Mahanamahewa highlighted that the US has consistently played a leading role in accusing Sri Lanka of war crimes and advocating for mechanisms such as hybrid courts, often backed by Western nations. However, he noted that the US withdrawal from the council could alter the geopolitical landscape in Sri Lankas favor. With this development, we have a significant opportunity to present our own human rights plan. A locally developed framework would allow us to take charge of our narrative and future policies. If we secure the support of key nations like India, South Africa, and Japan, we can effectively counter the earlier resolution against Sri Lanka, he stated.",

        "date": "February 7, 2025 08:53 am",
        "content": "Director General of the Power Sector Reforms Secretariat Pubudu Niroshan revealed that the committee appointed by the Ministry of Power and Energy to review the Sri Lanka Electricity Act has recommended that the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) be separated into three separate state-owned entities to oversee electricity generation, transmission and distribution. This will be a departure from the current provision to separate the CEB into 12 entities, some of which were to be privatized. Addressing the media, the Niroshan mentioned that a National System Operator which will also be state-owned will be established to oversee planning, procurement and constructions in the electricity sector. The Power Sector Reforms Secretariat DG further stated that the committee appointed by the Ministry of Power and Energy to review the Sri Lanka Electricity Act, on January 20, published an internal investigation report on the amendments required to the Act. Meanwhile, he noted that stakeholders can submit comments on the concept paper in writing until the February 14, either via post by addressing them to the Ministry of Power and Energy, Number 437, Galle Road, Colombo 03, or via email to the address reformspowermin.gov.lk. Niroshan expressed that based on the recommendations of the committee, three key amendments have been proposed for the act. Currently, the act states that the Ceylon Electricity Board will be separated into 12 separate entities, 3 of which will be state-owned, and of the remaining 9, some may be entirely privately owned and others public-private partnerships. However, under the new governments energy policy, three separate entities will be established for the generation, transmission and distribution of electricity, which will be state-owned at all times., he added. Additionally, a national system operator, which will also be entirely state-owned, will be established to oversee planning, procurement and constructions related to the electricity sector. Finally, a government trust will be established to provide EPF and ETF facilities for the current and retired staff of the CEB, Niroshan said. Furthermore, he emphasized that the Electricity Act already contains provisions regarding eliminating corruption in the CEB, stopping the malpractices of employees and to reduce the electricity tariff by a considerable amount. Commenting further, he added: We are the country with the highest electricity bills in the region. Currently the average price of a unit of electricity is 13 US cents or Rs. 39. Governments intention is to reduce it to Rs. 24 or 8 US cents. Within the next 5 years, government intends to make Sri Lanka the country with the most affordable electricity tariffs in the region.",

        "content": "Kanye West is sharing some news about his health. In a conversation on The Download podcast with Justin Laboy, West, who changed his name to Ye, said he was previously misdiagnosed with bipolar disorder. I went to this doctor  My wife took me to do that because she said, Something about your personality doesnt feel like its bipolar, Ive seen bipolar before. And Ive come to find that its really a case of autism that I have, West said. West said the diagnosis has helped him better understand himself. Autism takes you to a Rain Man thing, West said. When people tell you to not do it, you just get on that one point. And thats my problem. When fans tell me to do my album a certain way, Ill do it the opposite way, he added. West referenced his song Cant Tell Me Nothing and people close to him. Its so difficult for them, because this is like a grown man  you cant take control of his bank account, you cant control what Im saying on Twitter, West said. West had previously recounted being diagnosed with bipolar disorder and described his experience with an involuntary psychiatric hold. In a 2019 conversation with David Letterman, he said he was choosing to speak about his diagnosis and how he managed it to end the strong stigma around mental health. People are allowed to say anything about it and discriminate in any way, West said at the time. Autism spectrum disorder is a neurological and developmental disorder that affects how people interact with others, communicate, learn, and behave, according to the National Institute of Mental Health. Autism is not considered a mental health disorder and can be diagnosed at any age. I havent taken the medication since I found out that bipolar wasnt the right diagnosis, West said on The Download podcast this week. Its finding stuff that doesnt block the creativity, obviously thats what I bring to the world. Its worth the ramp-up, as long as yall get the creativity. Source: CNN --Agencies",

The initiatives include the launch of the GovPay platform for the digitalization of all government payments, expanding the services of the Presidents Fund from the main office in Colombo to the Divisional Secretariat level, and the introduction of the Electronic Birth, Marriage, and Death Certificates (EBMD) facility, allowing Sri Lankans abroad to obtain certified copies of birth, marriage, and death certificates through electronic means at Sri Lankan diplomatic missions. Accordingly, these services will be available starting today (Feb. 07). These new digital approaches have been introduced as part of the governments efforts to realize the vision of transitioning the country towards a digital society. Earlier, the government mentioned that cash-based payment fraud and corruption have led to increased inefficiencies in transaction processes and that in order to address these challenges, the government was taking steps to digitize all government payments, promoting digital payments and provide the public with more convenient and trustworthy services. The detailed information regarding the state institutions offering the GovPay service are available on the www.GovPay.lk website after 12 noon today (07). The Presidents Fund, which started in 1978, has previously accepted applications only at the main office in Colombo.

        "date": "February 7, 2025 04:21 pm",
        "content": "Aimed at accelerating Sri Lankas digital transformation, three key digital initiatives were officially launched today (07) at the Presidential Secretariat under the patronage of President Anura Kumara Dissanayake. These initiatives include the establishment of the GovPay government digital payment platform, the expansion of the Presidents Fund services to the Divisional Secretariat level, and the introduction of the eBMD system for obtaining birth, marriage, and death certificates through embassies. The project is being jointly implemented by the Ministry of Digital Economy, the Information and Communication Technology Agency (ICTA), and LankaPay, with the Central Bank of Sri Lanka ensuring the security of the payment platform and fostering public trust in its operations, according to the Presidents Media Division (PMD). Through the GovPay platform, payments for all services related to 16 government institutions can be processed in the initial phase. Starting from April, an additional 30 government institutions are planned to be integrated into the platform. Moving forward, there is an ambition to unify all government institutions under this system. Currently, 12 state and private banks have already joined the platform. Speaking at the event, President Anura Kumara Dissanayake emphasized that technological advancements play a pivotal role in improving peoples lives by delivering efficient, high-quality, and cost-effective services. He noted that throughout history, technological progress has been a driving force behind societal advancement, continuously elevating human civilization, the statement stated. The President also highlighted that the Presidents Fund has traditionally been managed from Colombo, which has posed significant challenges for citizens in remote villages. To address this, the Funds operations will now be decentralized to the Divisional Secretariat level, ensuring greater accessibility and convenience. He further stressed that such transformative decisions should have been made long ago, as delays in policy implementation have hampered economic progress and public welfare. However, with digitalization, urban and rural communities are now more interconnected than ever, making technology a vital tool in addressing rural poverty and resolving grassroots challenges. President Dissanayake reaffirmed that digitalization is the key driver that can propel Sri Lanka to a new stage of development, enabling citizens to meet their needs seamlessly, free from obstacles, inefficiencies, and bureaucratic delays, the PMD stated. President Anura Kumara Dissanayake emphasized that due to the mechanized nature of modern life, the Sri Lankan people have gradually lost their connection to cultural living. However, he pointed out that digitalization could facilitate the revival of cultural life, making it essential to ensure the success of this initiative. He further stated that the introduction of the Digital National Identity Card (Digital ID) marks a key milestone in this transformation. The President stressed the urgency of implementing these changes rapidly, highlighting that transparency, efficiency, and bridging the urban-rural divide are critical to Sri Lankas digital transformation. He assured that the government is making significant efforts to elevate the nation to a new level through digitalization. Senior Advisor to the President on Digitalization and Chairman of the Information and Communication Technology Agency (ICTA) Dr. Hans Wijayasuriya, stated that Sri Lanka already possesses 75 of the necessary skills to build a strong digital economy. However, to fully unlock this potential, the remaining gaps must be addressed, with a goal of completing this process within the next three years, he said. As part of this initiative, the Presidents Fund was officially decentralized to the Divisional Secretariat level, enabling online application submissions for financial assistance, the statement added. To further drive digital transformation, a system was introduced allowing Sri Lankans living abroad to obtain certified copies of birth, marriage, and death certificates through their respective embassies. As an initial implementation, a Sri Lankan resident in South Korea successfully received a birth certificate through the online system. This initiative marks a significant step forward, as enabling expatriate Sri Lankans to access official documents via their embassies will greatly simplify bureaucratic processes and improve their quality of life. The event was attended by Minister of Public Administration, Provincial Councils, and Local Government Chandana Abeyratne, Deputy Minister of Digital Economy Eranga Weeraratne, Secretary to the President Dr. Nandika Sanath Kumanayake, and Governor of the Central Bank Dr. Nandalal Weerasinghe, Secretary of the Presidents Fund and Senior Additional Secretary to the President Roshan Gamage, along with several other dignitaries. --PMD--",

        "content": "US lawmakers on Thursday brought forth a bill to ban Chinese artificial intelligence (AI) program DeepSeek from being used on government devices over concerns about user data security. Representative Josh Gottheimer, a New Jersey Democrat, introduced the bill along with Darin LaHood, an Illinois Republican, citing an alarming threat to US national security and warning of direct ties between DeepSeek and the Chinese government. The bill comes after a Wednesday report by Feroot Security, a US cybersecurity firm, claimed that the AI model contains hidden code capable of transmitting user data to China Mobile, a state-owned telecoms firm. Chinese startup DeekSeek shocked the global AI industry last month with the launch of its low-cost, high quality chatbot, which shook the lead the United States and other countries had in the ongoing race to develop the technology. The Chinese Communist Party has made it abundantly clear that it will exploit any tool at its disposal to undermine our national security, spew harmful disinformation, and collect data on Americans, Gottheimer said in a statement. LaHood, calling DeepSeek a CCP-affiliated company, said that under no circumstances can it be allowed to obtain sensitive government or personal data. The legislation in the House of Representatives comes as South Korean ministries and police said they were blocking DeepSeeks access to their computers, after the company did not respond to a data watchdog request about how it manages user information. Australia has also banned DeepSeek from all government devices on the advice of security agencies, while France and Italy have raised concerns about DeepSeeks data practice. Separately, video-sharing app TikTok is facing down a US law that orders the company to divest from its Chinese owner ByteDance or be banned in the United States. Source: AFP --Agencies",

DMK MP Tiruchi Siva said the matter of Tamil fisherfolks arrest was a national issue and claimed they were Indians being mistreated by Sri Lanka. Many other parties also took part in the protest. It is an issue which should not be restricted to the state. They are Tamil fishermen, they are Indians, Siva told PTI. Fishermen are being tortured, harassed and killed for years and the government does not take any concrete steps to resolve the issue. Earlier, they (Sri Lankan authorities) used to assault them and take away their catch. Recently, they have started using weapons to shoot the poor fishermen, the Rajya Sabha member said. He claimed the Indian fisherfolk were scared of venturing out to sea, disrupting their livelihood. Siva also said there was a proposal to include these fisherfolk in the Scheduled Tribe category. DMK MP Kanimozhi said Tamil Nadu Chief Minister MK Stalin had written to Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar several times on the matter, urging them to find a permanent solution. The Sri Lankan Navy has been arresting and harassing Tamil Nadus fishermen. Nearly 97 fishermen from Tamil Nadu have been arrested. Our Chief Minister MK Stalin has written to the prime minister, the external affairs minister, she said. They (Sri Lankan authorities) have taken away nearly 200 boats. The fishermens livelihood is being affected. The boats have been taken away and nationalised by the Sri Lankan government. The Union government has not done anything. Our demand is that the fishermen have to be released, the boats returned, and a permanent solution found, the Lok Sabha member said. Congress MP Manickam Tagore also demanded the Centre intervene in the matter and engage with the Sri Lankan government. We are protesting against the continuing arrests of Tamil fishermen by Sri Lanka... the Lok Sabha member said. Earlier, they (Sri Lankan authorities) would arrest the fishermen but release the boats. Now, they no longer release the boats and the fishermen are incurring huge losses, Tagore said. The government of India must intervene, it should talk to the Sri Lankan authorities and stop the seizure of boats and other material from the fishermen, he said. The Tamil fishermen issue has been a bone of contention between India and Sri Lanka for several years. The island nations navy has repeatedly been accused of arresting Indian fishermen who enter Sri Lankan territorial waters in the Palk Strait and seizing their boats. Earlier this month, the Sri Lankan authorities arrested 10 Indian fishermen and seized their boat for allegedly venturing into its territorial waters. In 2024, the Sri Lankan Navy arrested more than 550 Indian fishermen for alleged illegal fishing. Source: PTI --Agencies",

        "date": "February 8, 2025 07:14 am",
        "content": "A federal judge on Friday dealt President Donald Trump and billionaire ally Elon Musk their first big setback in their dismantling of the U.S. Agency for International Development, saying he will order a temporary halt to plans to pull thousands of agency staffers off the job. U.S. District Judge Carl Nichols, who was nominated by Trump, sided with two federal employee associations in agreeing to a pause in plans to put 2,200 employees on paid leave as of midnight Friday. Nichols stressed his order was not a decision on the employees request to roll back the administrations swiftly moving destruction of the agency. CLOSE IT DOWN, Trump said on social media of USAID before the judges ruling. The American Foreign Service Association and the American Federation of Government Employees argue that Trump lacks the authority to shut down the six-decade-old aid agency without approval from Congress. Democratic lawmakers have made the same argument. Trumps administration moved quickly Friday to literally erase the agencys name. Workers on a crane scrubbed the name from the stone front of its Washington headquarters. They used duct tape to block it out on a sign and took down USAID flags. Someone placed a bouquet of flowers outside the door. The Trump administration and Musk, who is running a budget-cutting Department of Government Efficiency, have made USAID their biggest target so far in an unprecedented challenge of the federal government and many of its programs. Administration appointees and Musks teams have shut down almost all funding for the agency, stopping aid and development programs worldwide, placed staffers and contractors on leave and furlough and locked them out of the agencys email and other systems. According to Democratic lawmakers, they also carted away USAIDs computer servers. This is a full-scale gutting of virtually all the personnel of an entire agency, Karla Gilbride, the attorney for the employee associations, told the judge. Department of Justice attorney Brett Shumate argued that the administration has all the legal authority it needs to place agency staffers on leave. The government does this across the board every day, Shumate said. Thats whats happening here. Its just a large number. Fridays ruling is the latest setback in the courts for the Trump administration, whose policies to offer financial incentives for federal workers to resign and end birthright citizenship for anyone born in the U.S. to someone in the country illegally have been temporarily paused by judges. Earlier Friday, a group of a half-dozen USAID officials speaking to reporters strongly disputed assertions from Secretary of State Marco Rubio that the most essential life-saving programs abroad were getting waivers to continue funding. None were, the officials said. Among the programs they said had not received waivers: 450 million in food grown by U.S. farmers sufficient to feed 36 million people, which was not being paid for or delivered; and water supplies for 1.6 million people displaced by war in Sudans Darfur region, which were being cut off without money for fuel to run water pumps in the desert. The judges order involved the Trump administrations decision earlier this week to pull almost all USAID workers off the job and out of the field worldwide. Besides the 2,200 workers temporarily protected from being put on leave, the fate was not clear of others who work with the agency and have been laid off, furloughed or put on leave. Trump and congressional Republicans have spoken of moving a much-reduced number of aid and development programs under the State Department. Within the State Department itself, employees fear substantial staff reductions following the deadline for the Trump administrations offer of financial incentives for federal workers to resign, according to officials who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal. A judge temporarily blocked that offer and set a hearing Monday. The administration earlier this week gave almost all USAID staffers posted overseas 30 days, starting Friday, to return to the U.S., with the government paying for their travel and moving costs. Diplomats at embassies asked for waivers allowing more time for some, including families forced to pull their children out of schools midyear. In a notice posted on the USAID website late Thursday, the agency clarified that none of the overseas personnel put on leave would be forced to leave the country where they work. But it said that workers who chose to stay longer than 30 days might have to cover their own expenses unless they received a specific hardship waiver. Rubio said Thursday during a trip to the Dominican Republic that the government would help staffers get home within 30 days if they so desired and would listen to those with special conditions. He insisted the moves were the only way to get cooperation because staffers were working to sneak through payments and push through payments despite the stop order on foreign assistance. Agency staffers deny his claims of obstruction. Rubio said the U.S. government will continue providing foreign aid, but it is going to be foreign aid that makes sense and is aligned with our national interest. Source: AP --Agencies",

        "date": "February 8, 2025 09:49 am",
        "content": "A small commuter plane that crashed in western Alaska on its way to the hub community of Nome was located Friday on sea ice, and all 10 people on board died, authorities said. The crash appeared to be one of the deadliest in the state in the last 25 years. Mike Salerno, a spokesperson for the U.S. Coast Guard, said rescuers were searching the aircrafts last known location by helicopter when the wreckage was spotted. Two rescue swimmers were lowered to investigate. A photo provided by the Coast Guard showed the planes splintered body and debris lying on the sea ice. Two people in brightly colored emergency gear circled the wreckage. Its hard to accept the reality of our loss, U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski said during an evening news conference. Nome Mayor John Handeland choked up as he discussed the deaths and the response effort. Nome is a strong community, and in challenging times we come together and support each other. I expect the outpouring of support to continue in the coming days as we all work to recover from this tragic incident, Handeland said. A prayer service was announced for later in the evening. Already the focus was shifting to a recovery operation because of rapidly changing conditions. Officials outlined the challenges including bad weather expected in the next 18 hours and young ice that was slushy and not stable. They are on the ice as we speak, said Jim West, chief of the Nome Volunteer Fire Department. The conditions out there are dynamic, and so weve got to do it safely and the fastest way we can. The Bering Air single-engine turboprop plane was traveling from Unalakleet on Thursday afternoon with nine passengers and a pilot, Alaskas Department of Public Safety said. It was operating at its maximum passenger capacity, according to the airlines description of the plane. The Cessna Caravan left Unalakleet at 2:37 p.m., and officials lost contact with it less than an hour later, according to David Olson, director of operations for Bering Air. There was light snow and fog, with a temperature of 17 degrees (minus 8.3 Celsius), according to the National Weather Service. The Coast Guard said the aircraft went missing about 30 miles (48 kilometers) southeast of Nome. Radar forensic data provided by the U.S. Civil Air Patrol indicated that about 3:18 p.m., the plane had some kind of event which caused them to experience a rapid loss in elevation and a rapid loss in speed, Coast Guard Lt. Cmdr. Benjamin McIntyre-Coble said. What that event is, I cant speculate to. McIntyre-Coble said he was unaware of any distress signals from the aircraft. Planes carry an emergency locating transmitter. If exposed to seawater, the device sends a signal to a satellite, which then relays that message back to the Coast Guard to indicate an aircraft may be in distress. There have been no such messages received by the Coast Guard, he said. All 10 people on board the plane were adults, and the flight was a regularly scheduled commuter trip, according to Lt. Ben Endres of the Alaska State Troopers. Local, state and federal agencies assisted in the search effort, combing stretches of ice-dotted waters and scouring miles of frozen tundra. The National Transportation Safety Board was sending nine people to the scene from various states. Flying is an essential mode of transportation in Alaska due to the vastness of the landscape and limited infrastructure. Most communities are not connected to the developed road system that serves the states most populous region, and its common to travel by small plane. Some high school teams fly to sporting events against rival high schools, and goods are brought to many communities by barge or by air. The planes disappearance marks the third major U.S. aviation mishap in eight days. A commercial jetliner and an Army helicopter collided near the nations capital on Jan. 29, killing 67 people. A medical transportation plane crashed in Philadelphia on Jan. 31, killing the six people on board and another person on the ground. Bering Air serves 32 villages in western Alaska from hubs in Nome, Kotzebue and Unalakleet. Most destinations receive twice-daily scheduled flights Monday through Saturday. Two Bering Air planes appeared to be searching in a grid pattern just off the coastline Friday morning, according to the flight tracking service Flightradar24. Unalakleet is a community of about 690 people about 150 miles (about 240 kilometers) southeast of Nome and 395 miles (about 640 kilometers) northwest of Anchorage. The village is on the Iditarod trail, route of the worlds most famous sled dog race, during which mushers and their teams must cross the frozen Norton Sound. Nome, a Gold Rush town, is just south of the Arctic Circle and is known as the ending point of the 1,000-mile (1,610-kilometer) Iditarod. The city said prayer vigils would be held Friday for those on board the plane, friends and family and those involved in search efforts. Source: AP --Agencies",

        "content": "President Anura Kumara Dissanayake invited Sri Lankan exporters to rebuild and thrive on a robust economic foundation. The President emphasized that the country faces the challenge of capturing market share from a position of relative weakness. He pointed out that, to overcome this, external support had to be sought. In this regard, he highlighted that the government is prepared to provide assistance for recovery based on the current economic stability. President Anura Kumara Dissanayake made these remarks at the 26th Presidential Export Awards Ceremony, according to the Presidents Media Division (PMD). The 26th Presidential Export Awards, organized by the Sri Lanka Export Development Board (EDB), was held yesterday (07) at the Bandaranaike Memorial International Conference Hall (BMICH) under the patronage of President Anura Kumara Dissanayake. The main objective of the awards ceremony is to recognize exporters who have made significant contributions to the economic development of Sri Lanka. The Presidential Export Award, presented by the President, is the highest honour for Sri Lankan exporters who have made significant contributions to the export sector and economic development. The Presidential Export Awards program, initiated by the EDB in 1981, has been held annually to recognize Sri Lankas top exporters. The awards ceremony for the 202324 financial year took place this year. A total of 14 major awards and 51 awards in the categories of production and services were presented, with recipients gaining the opportunity to use the Presidential Export Award logo as a marketing tool for three years, the statement said. President Anura Kumara Dissanayake further emphasized the critical importance of the trust placed in Sri Lanka by international economic stakeholders to stabilize the countrys economy. He noted that the global market economy is interconnected, not entirely independent. He further pointed out that the primary challenge facing Sri Lanka is securing a substantial share of the market amidst the current global division of markets and the ongoing competition to reclaim market shares. President Anura Kumara Dissanayake noted that the global market has become an interconnected network. He emphasized that in order for the country to become a key participant in this market, it must engage in trade agreements that are beneficial to Sri Lanka. He cautioned that aggressive, reckless approaches to market penetration would not be successful, stressing the need for strategic, thoughtful engagement. The President further stated that the government is already taking steps to provide the necessary technical support for Sri Lankan exporters to enter the market with high-quality products. He highlighted the governments focus on supplying new goods and services in response to global changes, in line with international market trends. Regarding the reduction of electricity bills, the President mentioned that the government is prioritizing renewable energy sources to maintain long-term stability in energy costs. He added that efforts are underway to lower costs and ensure stable pricing over the next few years. President Dissanayake also emphasized that the government is committed to playing a pivotal role in advancing the nations economy to new heights. He noted that even small or misguided decisions can have significant negative impacts on the economy, and therefore, decisions regarding the economy must be made with great caution and foresight, it added. In his remarks, the President assured that the government is fully committed to fulfilling exporters requests, which are vital to strengthening the nations economy and maintaining a strong economic foundation. Finally, the President invited Sri Lankan exporters to unite in strengthening the economy, stressing the importance of collaboration and mutual understanding to navigate the challenges of economic recovery and growth effectively. The ceremony was attended by several distinguished individuals, including Minister of Industry and Entrepreneurship Development Sunil Handunnetti, Minister of Labour and Deputy Minister of Economic Development Anil Jayantha Fernando, Minister of Energy Kumara Jayakody, Deputy Minister of Industry and Entrepreneurship Development Chathuranga Abeysinghe, Secretary to the Ministry of Industry and Entrepreneurship Development Thilaka Jayasundara, Chairman and Chief Executive of the Export Development Board of Sri Lanka Mangala Wijesinghe, Chairman of the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce Duminda Hulangamuwa, along with various Ministers, Deputy Ministers, Parliamentarians, foreign diplomats, Secretaries to the Ministries, and members of the EDB. --PMD--",

A government analyst report has also been requested to further investigate the incidents. The first fire occurred on the 35th floor of the building on February 6, while a second fire broke out on the 24th floor on February 7. In response to the fires, the Fire Department dispatched 6 fire engines, with 3 engines used to tackle the fires on each occasion. In the wake of these incidents, security at the Krrish building has been tightened, with a team of 20 police officers deployed to ensure the safety of the premises.",

        "date": "February 8, 2025 01:30 pm",
        "content": "The Bar Association of Sri Lanka (BASL) has expressed concern following media reports that suggest the Cabinet of Ministers may be considering a review of the Attorney Generals decision regarding the discharge of three suspects in the Lasantha Wickrematunge assassination case. While acknowledging that the Attorney General is a public official accountable to the public for his decisions, the BASL emphasized that the Attorney General performs a quasi-judicial role in criminal matters. As such, the Attorney General has to decide whether or not to charge a suspect based on the material available and submitted to him by the investigating authority. In doing so, he will be required to consider whether such material is admissible in law and whether based on such material there exists a reasonable prospect of a conviction, the BASL said in a letter address to the President. The Bar Association says that it has been held by the Supreme Court that decisions of the Attorney General are amenable to review and that such a review can be done either by way of exercise of writ jurisdiction or by way of the exercise of the fundamental rights jurisdiction. As such any decision to either discharge or prosecute a suspect would be subject to review by the apex courts according to law, it said. The BASL said it is firmly of the view that decisions of the Attorney General in criminal matters should not be reviewed by the political authorities including the Cabinet of Ministers as that would undermine the independence of the office of the Attorney General, which is crucial to uphold the rule of law. It further said that, whilst public debate on decisions made by any public functionary is a vital element of a democratic society, the need to safeguard the independence of these functionaries is equally important. It must be understood that judicial officers and quasi- judicial officers have to take decisions according to law, which sometimes may not necessarily reflect the popular view. The letter further notes that in the Victor Ivon v. Sarath N. Silva case (1998), Justice Mark Fernando observed: A citizen is entitled to a proper investigation - one which is fair, competent, timely and appropriate - of a criminal complaint, whether it be by him or against him. The criminal law exists for the protection of his rights - of person, property and reputation - and lack of a due investigation will deprive him of the protection of the law. Therefore, the Bar Association of Sri Lanka urged President Anura Kumara Dissanayake to ensure that there is no undue interference with the Attorney Generals powers and emphasizes the importance of protecting the independence of key institutions, including the office of the Attorney General, to uphold the rule of law in Sri Lanka.",

        "title": "Technical discussions ongoing to implement Indias DigiLocker in Sri Lanka  envoy",
        "date": "February 8, 2025 03:27 pm",
        "content": "The High Commissioner of India, Santosh Jha has commended the digital initiatives recently launched by the Sri Lankan government, including the GovPay platform for digitization of all government payments, and the introduction of the Electronic Birth, Marriage and Death Certificates facility for Sri Lankans abroad. Speaking during the BIMSTEC Digital Conclave held in Colombo on Friday (07), he stated that these initiatives form part of the special emphasis laid on digital transformation by the Sri Lankan Government led by President Anura Kumara Dissanayaka. The High Commission pointed out that India has over the past decade or so undergone a digital transformation at an unprecedented pace and scale, with unparalleled benefits to all sections of the society. At a time when mobile and data access were seen globally as a convenience, India adopted a model that envisioned digitization not only as a means of connectivity - but as a medium of equity and opportunity, he said, adding that it is the essence of Digital Public Infrastructure. India had issued digital IDs  referred to as Aadhaar  to1.3 billion of its citizens. We have 1.2 billion mobile phone users, 950 million internet users. 40 of the worlds real-time digital transactions take place in India. Over the last decade, India has laid optical fiber that is eight times the distance between the Earth and the Moon! Almost every district in India is connected to 5G services. Today, India stands as the second-largest 5G market in the world, and we are now rapidly working on 6G technology, he said. He further said that India has used the power of the JAM trinity  Jan Dhan bank accounts, Aadhaar or the digital identity, and Mobile phones  to revolutionize financial inclusion in India. The High Commissioner said this has allowed the Indian government to make 450 million direct cash transfers, transfer food rations to 850 million directly in full transparency in the last 10 years. Direct Benefits Transfer has amounted to about 450 billion US Dollars. It has also plugged leakages, and has saved over 35 billion US Dollars, he revealed. Santosh Jha mentioned that the new buzz in the DPI space is around ONDC- Open Network for Digital Commerce, an innovation that will democratize e-commerce, particularly benefitting small and medium enterprises. He said that over 400 million Indians can access their important documents anytime anywhere using the DigiLocker - a secure cloud-based platform for storage, sharing and verification of documents  certificates. We are working towards bringing similar models of digitization for transformation in the health and education sectors as well. India is committed to lean on its DPI success story to fast track means of unlocking opportunities and potentialities for the entire region, Jha said. In the bilateral context, the High Commissioner pointed out that the recent visit of President Anura Kumara Dissanayaka to India added further momentum to this very important pillar of cooperation  people-centric digitization. The leaders agreed to expedite implementation of the India-assisted INR 300 crores Sri Lanka Unique Digital Identity (SLUDI) project which will act as the foundational DPI and unlock developmental dividends of the DPI Stack for Sri Lanka. A Joint Working Group on Digital Economy has also been set up, he added. Technical discussions on the implementation of DigiLocker in Sri Lanka are ongoing. While UPI Payments was launched in Sri Lanka last year for the ease of payments for Indian tourists, we are now looking at extending the use of UPI digital payments for the benefit of both countries, the Indian High Commissioner added. There is also interest for bilateral exchanges to garner learnings from Indias GeM portal, PM Gati Shakti digital platform on coordinated and integrated development of infrastructure, digitized customs and other taxation procedures, with a view to exploring the benefits of establishing equivalent systems in Sri Lanka, the Indian envoy noted. The benefits of these are clearly visible in India. GeM Portal alone has led to saving of 13 billion US Dollars in last decade by bringing down expenditure on projects and procurements. The GATI SHAKTI has significantly expanded the pace of infrastructure development. Similarly, Digitization of Taxation System has increased revenues and has even brought in greater transparency.",

        "title": "Modis BJP wins Delhi election after 27 years",
        "date": "February 8, 2025 04:40 pm",
        "content": "Prime Minister Narendra Modis party will form the government in Indian capital Delhi after 27 years as it scripted an impressive election victory. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has won or is leading in 47 seats in the 70-member legislative assembly, while the incumbent Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) is ahead in 23 seats, according to data from the Election Commission of India (EC). A party that wins more than the halfway mark of 35 seats can form the government. Development wins, good governance triumphs, Modi wrote on X, adding that his party would leave no stone unturned in developing Delhi . The election was a battle of prestige for both the BJP and AAP, given Delhis symbolic importance as the countrys capital. The city, a federally-administered territory, was governed by the AAP since 2013, with voters backing its strong record of welfarism. But the party and its leaders have faced several challenges recently, with leaders embroiled in corruption allegations which they have denied. For the BJP, securing Delhi represents more than just electoral success - it marks a crucial foothold in the nations capital after being out of power there since 1998. The party, which has had recent election successes in other states, such as Maharashtra and Chhattisgarh, threw resources at the Delhi campaign, with Modi as well as Home Minister Amit Shah attending events. Congress, the main opposition party at the national level, was also in the race, but is unlikely to win even one seat. The party governed Delhi from 1998 to 2013, but was ousted over allegations of corruption that saw voters turn to AAP instead. It has failed to make a mark since. Experts say that the win in politically crucial Delhi will reinforce Modis popularity among Indian voters after his party lost its outright majority in last years general election. The defeat is a big blow to the AAP, a much smaller party which was praised in its early years in power for focusing on improving education and health facilities in the city. It also governs Punjab state, but retaining Delhi would have been a triumph for the beleaguered party which now faces questions about its future. On Saturday, the biggest upsets for AAP included top leaders Arvind Kejriwal and Manish Sisodia losing in the New Delhi and Jangpura constituencies, respectively. Incumbent Chief Minister Atishi managed only a narrow victory from the Kalkaji constituency. In a video message on X, Kejriwal said he and his party humbly accepted the verdict of the people and congratulated the BJP on its win. I hope they live up to the expectations of the people who voted for them, he said. More than 60 of eligible voters cast their ballot in the election on Wednesday. Most exit polls had predicted an absolute majority for the BJP, although such predictions have gone wrong in the past. Much of the BJP campaign targeted Kejriwal, an anti-graft activist, who - along with Sisodia - had been jailed over the past two years in a corruption case relating to a now-scrapped alcohol sales policy. Both leaders, who deny all the charges, separately got bail last year after spending months in jail. Kejriwal has accused Modis party of carrying out a political vendetta against him and the AAP, which the BJP denies. The Supreme Courts bail conditions banned him from entering the chief ministers office or signing files. Kejriwal resigned from the role days after his release from prison. Source: BBC --Agencies",

As a result, the Netflix documentary will not be released. Soon after, the Prince X account posted a video with the message: The Vault Has Been Freed.
