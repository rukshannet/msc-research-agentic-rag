        "content": "The European Union ambassador to Sudan was attacked in his home in Khartoum on Monday, the blocs top diplomat Josep Borrell said, as fighting between rival generals gripped the nation. A few hours ago, the EU Ambassador in Sudan was assaulted in his own residency, Borrell wrote on Twitter, without detailing any injuries to the envoy. Security of diplomatic premises and staff is a primary responsibility of Sudanese authorities and an obligation under international law, he added. The European Unions ambassador to Sudan is 58-year-old Irish diplomat Aidan OHara. EU spokeswoman Nabila Massrali told AFP that he was OK following the assault. The security of the staff is our priority, she said. The EU delegation has not been evacuated. Security measures are being assessed. Irelands deputy prime minister and foreign minister Micheal Martin said OHara was not seriously hurt but that the assault was a gross violation of obligations to protect diplomats under the Vienna Convention. Aidan is an outstanding Irish and European diplomat who is serving the EU under the most difficult circumstances, Martin said. We thank him for his service and call for an urgent cessation of violence in Sudan, and resumption of dialogue. Fighting between the Sudanese army and a rival paramilitary faction has killed around 200 people and wounded 1,800 after three days of urban warfare. The United Nations has called for an immediate ceasefire and international bodies, including the European Union, have expressed grave concern Source  AFP - Agencies",

        "title": "Frontier markets debt hit record 3.6 trillion last year  report",
        "date": "April 18, 2023 10:49 am",
        "content": "The value of frontier markets debt hit a record of 3.6 trillion last year, driven by a sharp rise in government and non-financial corporate sector borrowing. Frontier markets added 120 billion to their debt pile last year, with government debt reaching a new high of nearly 2 trillion. Non-financial corporate sector borrowing rose close to 1 trillion, the Institute of International Finance (IIF) said in its latest Frontier Market Debt Monitor report. However, despite the continued build-up in debt across sectors, the pace of growth was relatively moderate last year  in fact, the slowest rate of increase since 2018, IIF economists Emre Tiftik, Khadija Mahmood and Raymond Aycock said in the report. Total frontier market debt-to-gross domestic production ratio also dropped for the second consecutive year, driven by strong growth momentum and an inflation-driven rise in borrowing costs. Higher commodity prices also curbed the need for borrowings, especially for hydrocarbon-exporting nations. The debt-to-GDP ratio dropped to 100 per cent in 2022, from 104 per cent the previous year. With around 26 countries (in our sample of 42 frontier markets) seeing some reduction in total debt ratios last year, the declines were particularly notable in Angola, Bahrain and Oman as higher commodity prices have reduced borrowing needs of many oil exporters, the IIF said. In contrast, Sri Lanka, Lao and Ghana saw the largest increases in debt ratios. In terms of sectors, the decline in debt-to-GDP ratio was more evident for governments and households. At 56 per cent of GDP, frontier market government debt is now around 4 percentage points lower than its peak in 2020, the IIF said. In February, the Washington-based institute said the nominal value of global debt declined by 4 trillion to below 300 trillion last year, helped by stronger growth momentum and higher inflation. Following a substantial surge in 2020-2021 during the pandemic, the global debt pile shrank to 299 trillion last year, marking the first decline since 2015, the IIF said at the time. Central banks around the world have increased their benchmark policy rates to curb inflation. The US Federal Reserve has been increasing its benchmark rates aggressively since March last year. Another rise in policy rate is expected when it meets next month as it aims to bring down inflation from the 40-year highs of 2022 to its target range of 2 per cent. The rise in interest rates makes borrowing in US dollars more expensive for governments, corporations and financial institutions, as well as household borrowers. The strength of the US dollar has been an important driver of a rise in debt ratio for many vulnerable low-income countries. For some, delays in debt restructuring have exacerbated these debt vulnerabilities, the IIF economists said. In addition to increasing debt vulnerabilities amid rising interest rates, frontier markets are also facing growing challenges from high inflation, weak economic growth, limited sources of external financing, persistent food insecurity and rising threats from climate change and natural disasters. In 2023, slow economic growth and tightening financial conditions will likely mean an even greater risk of debt distress, highlighting the debates about comprehensive structural reforms to reduce high sovereign debt burdens, the IIF said. In countries such as Ghana, Sri Lanka and Zambia, where sovereign debt restructuring has become unavoidable, co-ordination among official bilateral creditors  both Paris Club and non-Paris Club  to expedite an orderly debt restructuring remains the biggest challenge. Common Framework-eligible countries are scheduled to repay over 55 billion of public external debt in 2023, the IIF economists said. Many frontier market sovereigns still have limited access to international debt markets, despite tentative signs of recovery in early 2023. Source  The National -Agencies",

        "date": "April 18, 2023 01:05 pm",
        "content": "About 300 people lined up at Apples store in Mumbai on Tuesday, as fans took selfies with Chief Executive Tim Cook who inaugurated the first retail store run by the company in India, underscoring the importance of its market. People gathered from across the nation, hoping to be among the first to enter the store in an opening event featuring local music and folk dancers. Some fans queued outside from the previous night to get their hands on Apple products, even though they are available online in India. The fanboy inside me would not listen, Purav Mehta, 30, told Reuters, as he waited to get Cooks signature on his boxed mint-condition iPod Touch, which he had bought on eBay, as well as waiting to buy the Apple Watch Ultra. Many wore T-shirts in the style favoured by co-founder Steve Jobs, had their hair cut in the shape of an Apple logo and one fan even brought a version of the first Apple computer launched in 1984. The vibe here is just different, said 23-year old Aan Shah, who travelled from the western industrial city of Ahmedabad for the launch in Indias commercial capital. Its not like buying from some normal store. Theres just no comparison. Its so exciting. His love for Apple took him to store openings as a young student in New York and Boston, where he once got a chance to meet Cook, he said. Apple has previously faced hurdles in opening physical retail stores in the South Asian nation, but its products have been available on e-commerce websites, while its online store opened in 2020. The new store opens as Indian consumers increasingly look to upgrade their smartphones to glitzier models, with richer feature sets, from budget devices typically costing less than 120. Still, Apples pricey phones are affordable for only a few in India, where it accounts for just a 3 share of the market. The new store, located in the Reliance-owned Jio World Drive mall, opened for bloggers and tech analysts at a private event on Monday, while many Indian film and television celebrities were seen meeting Cook that night. A second store in Delhi, the capital, is set to open on Thursday. Cook is set to meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the deputy IT minister later this week. As Apple pushes to make India a bigger manufacturing base, some of its products, including iPhones, are being assembled in the country by Taiwanese contract electronics manufacturers Foxconn and Wistron Corp. It also plans to assemble iPads and AirPods in India. Source - Reuters -Agencies",

        "content": "The Super Mario Bros. Movie soared higher than expected in its second weekend of release. The animated adventure, from Universal, Nintendo and Illumination, took first place again with 92 million over the weekend, above Sundays already-huge estimate of 87 million. Those returns rank as the highest-grossing second weekend for an animated film, as well as the seventh-highest grossing second weekend for any film at the domestic box office, according to Universal. Thanks to huge demand from family audiences and plenty of nostalgia, ticket sales for Mario declined only 37 from its mighty 146 million three-day start and currently stand at 353 million. Thats especially impressive because big-budget blockbusters  even well-received ones  generally plummet by 50 or more after scoring huge opening weekends. The Super Mario Bros. Movie also notched a significant global milestone, crossing 700 million after just 13 days of release. So far, only 12 Hollywood releases have managed to surpass the 700 million mark since the pandemic. Mario currently stands as the second-biggest animated film of the pandemic, behind Universal and Illuminations Minions: The Rise of Gru (942.5 million). The video game adaptation is primed to not only surpass the Despicable Me spinoff in terms of worldwide ticket sales, but its also expected to soon become the first movie of 2023 to cross 1 billion globally. The box office milestones dont stop there. After two weekends in theaters, Mario already stands as the highest-grossing film of the year at the domestic and global box office, surpassing Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania (212 million domestically and 474 million globally). Mario also became the biggest video game adaptation in history, overtaking the totals of 2016s Warcraft (439 million) and Pokémon: Detective Pikachu (449 million). At the international box office, The Super Mario Bros. Movie added 102 million in its second weekend of release, boosting its overseas tally to 339 million. Top markets include Mexico (53.4 million), U.K. and Ireland (44.3 million) and Germany (29 million). As Mario would say, Wahoo! Source  Variety - Agencies",

        "date": "April 18, 2023 04:09 pm",
        "content": "The United Nations is ready to take the heartbreaking decision to pull out of Afghanistan in May if it cant persuade the Taliban to let local women work for the organization, the head of the U.N. Development Program said. U.N. officials are negotiating with the Islamist government in the hope that it will make exceptions to an edict this month barring local women from working for the organization, UNDP Administrator Achim Steiner told The Associated Press. It is fair to say that where we are right now is the entire United Nations system having to take a step back and reevaluating its ability to operate there, Steiner said. But its not about negotiating fundamental principles, human rights. The Taliban have allowed Afghan women to engage in some work, Steiner said, and a U.N. report released Tuesday shows that the country desperately needs more women working, with its economy flailing. The Taliban takeover has been accompanied by some very modest signs of economic recovery. There has been some increase in exports, some exchange rate stabilization and less inflation. But gross domestic product, the sum of all goods and services produced within Afghanistans borders, is expected to be outstripped by population growth, meaning that per capita income will decline from 359 in 2022 to 345 in 2024, the report says. Some of those economic problems are due to Taliban policies keeping most women out of the workplace, Steiner said. Those economic problems mean more need in the country, but the U.N. has decided that human rights are non-negotiable and it will leave in May if the Taliban do not relent. I think there is no other way of putting it than heartbreaking, Steiner said. I mean, if I were to imagine the U.N. family not being in Afghanistan today, I have before me these images of millions of young girls, young boys, fathers, mothers, who essentially will not have enough to eat. A source of faint optimism is the Talibans allowing women to work in specific circumstances in health, education and some small businesses. In one sense, the de facto authorities have enabled the U.N. to roll out a significant humanitarian and also emergency development assistance set of activities, Steiner said. But they also continuously are shifting the goalposts, issuing new edicts. Despite initial promises of a more moderate rule than during their previous stint in power in the 1990s, the Taliban have imposed harsh measures since taking over the country in 2021 as U.S. and NATO forces were pulling out of Afghanistan after two decades of war. This month the Taliban took a step further in the restrictive measures they have imposed on women and said that female Afghan staffers employed with the U.N. mission can no longer report for work. This is a very fundamental moment that were approaching. And obviously our hope and expectation is that there will be some common sense prevailing, Steiner said. Afghanistans deputy economy minister, Abdul Latif Nazari, did not respond to questions from the AP about the countrys economic conditions. A spokesman for the Finance Ministry, Ahmad Wali Haqmal, was unavailable for comment. Aid agencies have been providing food, education and health care support to Afghans since the Taliban takeover and the economic collapse that followed it. No country has recognized the Taliban as the legitimate government of Afghanistan, and the countrys seat at the U.N. is held by the former government of President Ashraf Ghani. The 3,300 Afghans employed by the U.N.  2,700 men and 600 women  have stayed home since April 12 but continue to work and will be paid, U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric has said. The U.N.s 600 international staff, including 200 women, is not affected by the Taliban ban. Source - The Associated Press -Agencies",

        "content": "The Bureau of Foreign Employment (SLBFE) and the Vocational Training Authority today (April 18) inked a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to provide vocational training aimed at foreign employment. Minister of Labour and Foreign Employment Manusha Nanayakkara, who was present at the event signing of the MoU, said Sri Lanka needs to more skilled workers to meet the demand for employment opportunities in countries like Japan, Europe, Canada, Australia and the Middle East. The Ministry of Labour  Foreign Employment has managed to secure a number of lucrative job opportunities for Sri Lankans in caregiving, hospitality and construction fields in the aforementioned countries and regions, the lawmaker said, adding that there is, however, a lack of skilled workers in the country to meet this demand. Taking this into account, the Foreign Employment Bureau and the Vocational Training Authority entered into an MoU to produce more skilled workers with the aim of securing these job opportunities. Pursuant to this MoU, the Vocational Training Authority will train professionals with necessary skills for foreign employment, provide them with the national vocational qualifications and provide other professional certificates according to the guidelines provided by the Foreign Employment Bureau. When providing foreign employment opportunities in the future, Nanayakkara said the priority would be given to workers who have received training from the Vocational Training Authority. Registration of students, the standard of training, and regulation and certification process will be subject to guidelines of the Foreign Employment Bureau. Speaking further, Nanayakkara said, Under the SLBFE Act, which functions under the Ministry of Labour  Foreign Employment, there is an opportunity to train workers aimed at foreign jobs. But training is not our main task. The main task of this institution is to regulate the field of foreign employment. Further, the welfare of expatriate workers and their family members becomes a major responsibility of this institution, he added. The primary responsibility for training workers for employment is assigned to the Ministry of Education and to the Ministry of Vocational Training. So we took a decision to leave such matters in the hands of the vocational training institutes in the public sector and the private vocational training institutes recognized by the government. It will be implemented as a policy decision. We are paying more attention to the welfare and protection of expatriate workers and their families. From here on, the Foreign Employment Bureau will deal with the welfare and safety of the expatriate worker and also intervene in streamlining remittances sent by the expatriate worker in the correct way through legally accredited channels, Nanayakkara said further.",

        "content": "Minister of Foreign Affairs Ali Sabry, has described Sri Lanka as a hub of opportunities for investors, despite its recent crisis. Speaking at the launch of the BLOCKCHAIN CENTRE in Sri Lanka held in Colombo on Monday (17 April), Sabry explained that Sri Lanka is ideal to facilitate such a platform, owing to its abundance of investment opportunities and the renowned hospitality of its people. Despite our drawbacks, and some extremists from all communities, our people are our biggest strength. Sri Lanka has 97 literacy, very high literacy. We have free education and free healthcare for all, the Minister said, explaining that the concept of free-university-for-all followed in Sri Lanka allows for the production of several talented students each year, ripe-for-the-picking of investors willing to give them opportunities. Expressing his gratitude to the investors for choosing Sri Lanka for this project, Minister Sabry assured that this was the right decision, and that it would help uplift the standard of life of those living in Sri Lanka. Speaking more on the opportunities available for investors, the Minister spoke of the flights between Jaffna and India, revealing that plans are underway to operate bigger flights on this route more frequently, adding that the proposed ferry service between India and Sri Lanka is also expected to commence at the end of this month. With that there are so much of opportunities here. We dont need to fight each other, we must work together and build this nation so everyone will have a good life. Thats what we are creating here. Sri Lanka has the potential to do so, he said in this regard, adding that Sri Lanka continued to look after its people despite being bankrupt one year ago. Moreover, the Minister emphasised that apart from investors benefitting from Sri Lankas location, the island nation is also a gateway for 1.8 billion South Asians. We are open to business with China and the West and the Middle East and South Asia, we dont get into any of the blocks, we are an independent, multi-aligned, proud country with a rule of law and a strong independent judiciary, he said in this regard, assuring that all investments would be safe.",

        "content": "State Minister of Finance Ranjith Siyambalapitiya says that measures will be taken to relax the import restrictions imposed on many other goods. Speaking to the media today (April 18), following a review meeting on Sri Lanka Customs revenue targets for the year, the State Minister pointed out that it will also help Sri Lanka Customs to achieve the expected income. Siyambalapitiya, who emphasized that the revenue target given to the Sri Lanka Customs for the first three months of the year is Rs. 270 billion, however mentioned that the revenue generated during that period is 12 less than the expected income. The main cause of this is the import restrictions imposed by the government, he claimed. 485 items were subjected to the relevant import restrictions in 2021, while another 750 items were restricted in 2022, the State Minister highlighted, also stating that the appreciation of the Rupee in March also led to the Customs Departments inability to reach the expected revenue targets. Furthermore, the State Minister expressed that therefore, the relevant import restrictions will be relaxed in the near future with much consideration and that especially, the decisions will be arrived at based on the recommendations provided by the Economic Research Department of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka.",

        "content": "At least two people have been killed after a massive landslide struck northwestern Pakistan and buried two dozen trucks at a key trade route. The landslide occurred on the main route connecting the Pakistan-Afghanistan border near Torkham town at 2.30am on Tuesday, according to a statement by the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Disaster Management Authority cited by the Dawn newspaper. The border crossing is a key trade route between Pakistan and Afghanistan as well as other central Asian countries. Landslides in the area are known to block roads frequently, with the current one being triggered by lightning during heavy rain. Around 15-20 cargo vehicles have been buried, with firefighters and rescue teams from Khyber, Peshawar, Nowshera, Charsadda and Mardan areas participating in rescue operations, said the statement. Officials have also warned there could be another landslide. The teams are involved in trying to save truck drivers and other people hit by the landslide, police official Ishrat Khan was quoted as saying to the Associated Press. According to rescuers, one truck had caught fire after it was struck by lightning. Bilal Faizi, a spokesperson for a state-run rescue service, said two bodies were pulled out and eight people were injured. The injured have been taken to a nearby hospital. Authorities said volunteers also joined in the search for survivors and heavy machinery has been dispatched to Torkham to try and remove rocks and other debris. Rescuers are very careful because there is a possibility of another landslide but they are risking their lives to pull out those feared trapped, Mr Faizi was quoted as saying. Officials said 12 ambulances, four fire vehicles, three recovery vehicles and three heavy excavators were deployed at the site. Mr Faizi told Dawn that a fire had broken out immediately after the landslide as drivers were cooking meals on gas stoves. Source - Independent -Agencies",

        "date": "April 18, 2023 06:02 pm",
        "content": "The Sectoral Oversight Committee on Environment, Natural Resources and Sustainable Development has instructed officials of both the Maritime Environment Protection Authority (MEPA) and the National Aquatic Resources Research and Development Agency (NARA) to facilitate the expert committee to obtain samples from the site at which the X-Press Pearl caught fire in Sri Lankan waters. At a meeting held earlier this month, the expert committee appointed to assess the full extent of the environmental and other damages caused by the incident, pointed out that the inability to go near the ship or inside the ship posed as obstacles in calculating the full damage. They stated that even though they were prevented by MEPA and NARA from going to sites near the ship as it was dangerous, the institutions should have instead, with the aid of the Sri Lanka Navy and the Air Force, facilitated a safe way to enter the area so as to obtain said samples. Thus, the Parliamentary committee Chair, MP Ajith Mannapperuma, instructed both MEPA and NARA to expedite these activities as the inability to obtain these samples from the vicinity of the ship may be disadvantageous in the compensation claim case. The prosecution of the Singaporean vessel was also discussed at the meeting, during which a group of lawyers present emphasised that there remains only 45 days to file a lawsuit in this regard. They added that despite receiving Cabinet approval to do so, it would be disadvantageous to file the relevant lawsuit in Singapore. MEPA Chairman Asela Rekawa further assured that the report of the committee related to the USD 6.2 billion compensation has been forwarded to the Attorney Generals Department, adding that the prosecution should be done by the AGs Department. Meanwhile, representatives of the AGs Department assured that a lawsuit to obtain the relevant compensation would be filed promptly based on the said report, while the Committee is due to meet again on 25 April to review the progress of the compensation recovery process. Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa, Justice Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe, State Minister Anuradha Jayaratne, Members of Parliament Akila Ellawala, Waruna Liyanage, Nalaka Bandara Kottegoda, Upul Mahendra Rajapaksha, were present at the committee meeting.",

        "date": "April 18, 2023 07:09 pm",
        "content": "The winner of a major photography award has refused his prize after revealing his work was in fact an AI creation. German artist Boris Eldagsens entry, entitled Pseudomnesia: The Electrician, won the creative open category at last weeks Sony World Photography Award. He said he used the picture to test the competition and to create a discussion about the future of photography. Organisers of the award told BBC News Eldagsen had mis-led them about the extent of AI that would be involved. In a statement shared on his website, Eldagsen admitted he had been a cheeky monkey, thanking the judges for selecting my image and making this a historic moment, while questioning if any of them knew or suspected that it was AI-generated. AI images and photography should not compete with each other in an award like this, he continued. They are different entities. AI is not photography. Therefore I will not accept the award. The image in question showed a haunting black-and-white portrait of two women from different generations. But as Eldagsen pointed out in his statement: Something about this doesnt feel right, does it? That something, of course, being the fact that its not a real photograph at all - but a synthetically-produced image. The use of AI in everything from song and essay writing, to driverless cars, chatbox therapists and the development of medicine has been widely debated in recent months; now its appropriateness and utility regarding photography - especially deepfakes - has come into focus. A spokesperson for the World Photography Organisation, the photography strand of art events organisers Creo, said that during their discussions with the artist, before he was announced as the winner, he had confirmed the piece was a co-creation of his image using AI. He noted his interest in the creative possibilities of AI generators, they added, while emphasising the image heavily relies on his wealth of photographic knowledge. The creative category of the open competition welcomes various experimental approaches to image making from cyanotypes and rayographs to cutting-edge digital practices, they said. As such, following our correspondence with Boris and the warranties he provided, we felt that his entry fulfilled the criteria for this category, and we were supportive of his participation. Additionally, we were looking forward to engaging in a more in-depth discussion on this topic and welcomed Boris wish for dialogue by preparing questions for a dedicated QA with him for our website. They continued: As he has now decided to decline his award we have suspended our activities with him and in keeping with his wishes have removed him from the competition. They said they recognised the importance of this subject AI and its impact on image-making today but stressed the awards always have been and will continue to be a platform for championing the excellence and skill of photographers and artists working in the medium. I dont blame Boris Eldagsen told the BBC on Monday he had made it clear to the organisers that he too wanted to publicly engage in a open discussion on the topic, from much earlier on in the awards process, but that this had come to no avail. He also suggested donating the prize to a photo festival hosted in Odesa, Ukraine. Photographer and blogger Feroz Khan took a particular interest in how the events of the past week unfolded. And he said he did not blame the artist for showing there is a problem here in the photography industry. For starters, most people have a tough time distinguishing AI-generated images from photographs (at least at first glance), he wrote. In a few months, it will probably become even harder to determine critical differences unless scrutinised. With this intention, Boris has stated that he wants photography contest organisers to have separate categories for AI images. I appreciate him for wanting this distinction in photo contests. Yes, he entered an AI image into the competition, but it doesnt seem he was out to defraud anyone. He wanted to highlight an issue that certainly needs a lot more attention from everyone. He concluded that Eldagsen had clearly shown that even experienced photographers and art experts can be fooled. An exhibition of the winners and shortlisted images from this years Sony World Photography Awards is taking place at Somerset House, London from now until 1 May 2023. Source  BBC - Agencies",

        "date": "April 18, 2023 09:14 pm",
        "content": "Justice Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe says he has been tipped off on several occasions about a local official being bribed by the insurer of the tanker MV X-Press Pearl, which was gutted in a fire that erupted off the western coast of Sri Lanka two years ago. The lawmaker made this staggering revelation while addressing a media briefing in Colombo today (April 18). According to him, speculations are rife that a local official has received a bribe of USD 250 million from the vessels insurers to disrupt the litigation and compensation processes. The justice minister said he has given directives to the Inspector-General of Police and the DIG in charge of the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) to initiate an investigation to uncover the truth. Sri Lanka witnessed what is considered one of the worst marine environmental disasters after the Singapore-flagged container ship vessel, only three months after being commissioned, caught fire some 16 kilometers off Colombo on May 20, 2021, while transporting 1,500 containers including 25 tonnes of nitric acid. The fire that continued for nearly two weeks resulted in a massive spillage of damaged containers, microplastics, plastic pellets, chemicals and other harmful substances into the sea. Following the disaster, the Marine Environment Protection Authority (MEPA) appointed a committee of experts comprising professors and other relevant top public officials to assess the damage. The MEPA says it has provided all necessary documents to the Attorney Generals Department to prosecute the ship owner or the operator or the ships agents in Sri Lanka under the Criminal Law, in terms of Section 26 of the Prevention of Maritime Corruption Act. As the approval of the Cabinet of Ministers is given to continue the litigation process in Singapore, the Attorney Generals Department recently mentioned that it is proceeding with the legal matter accordingly. However, the committee of expert lawyers appointed to look into the matter has suggested that the prosecution be done in Sri Lanka to recover the estimated USD 6.2 billion in damages. The decision to continue the legal proceedings in Singapore attracted criticism as it was deemed a very costly move. According to experts, only 32 days are left to file a lawsuit on the matter.",

        "content": "The police have secured a seven-day detention order to interrogate the six suspects arrested on international waters off the southern coast of Sri Lanka with a large consignment of heroin. The suspects were produced before the Colombo Chief Magistrate this morning (April 18). The Police Narcotics Bureau (PNB) is conducting further investigations into the matter. The investigators have uncovered that this drug syndicate is being handled from overseas. Accordingly, probes are underway to apprehend the drug lord who is in hiding in a foreign country and the suspects linked to the drug network here in Sri Lanka. The suspects aboard a multiday fishing trawler were apprehended on April 15 while transporting 179kg of heroin with a gross street value of Rs. 3.5 billion, nearly 132 nautical miles (about 244km) off the Little Basses, Hambantota. The narcotics consignment was impounded during a joint operation initiated by the Sri Lanka Navy and Sri Lanka Coast Guard, based on the information received from the State Intelligence Service, the Naval Intelligence and the PNB. Upon receiving the intelligence information, Sri Lanka Coast Guard Ship Samudraraksha was deployed for the operation, which resulted in the seizure of six suspects and the massive heroin consignment. The apprehended suspects, the heroin haul and the fishing trawler were brought ashore to the Galle Harbour on Monday morning (April 17). The suspects held in the operation have been identified as residents of Nakulugamuwa, Kudawella, Netolpitiya, and Trincomalee, aged between 25 and 32 years. They were handed over to the Police Narcotic Bureau for onward legal action. Including the latest seizure, the Sri Lanka Navy has held drugs with a gross street value of over Rs. 4,908 million during operations mounted in 2023.",

This was mentioned when the new Ambassador of Sri Lanka to Vietnam, Sajeewa Umanga Mendis presented their credentials to President Thuong on Tuesday (April 18). The Sri Lankan envoy appreciated Vietnams socio-economic development achievements and showed his hope that the two sides will maintain cooperation and experience sharing, and boost people-to-people exchanges. President Thuong emphasized the importance of promoting high-level contacts and people-to-people diplomacy to intensify friendship and mutual understanding; and stepping up the implementation of existing cooperation mechanisms. The two sides agreed to promote bilateral cooperation in trade and investment, and share experience in poverty reduction, human development, education, health and culture.

The two sides also need to promote existing cooperation mechanisms, support each other at multilateral forums, and share views and visions on international and regional issues. With a two-way trade of more than USD 2 billion, there remains ample room for bilateral cooperation, noted Thuong. The Chilean ambassador expressed his hope that the two nations will expand collaboration in all fields, especially politics, economics and people-to-people exchanges. -with inputs from Vietnam Plus",

        "title": "Fox settles Dominion lawsuit for 787.5 million over US election lies",
        "date": "April 19, 2023 09:34 am",
        "content": "Fox Corp and Fox News on Tuesday settled a defamation lawsuit by Dominion Voting Systems for 787.5 million, averting a trial putting one of the worlds top media companies in the crosshairs over its coverage of false vote-rigging claims in the 2020 U.S. election. The settlement, which legal experts said was the largest struck by an American media company, was announced by the two sides and the judge in the case at the 11th hour. The jury had been selected earlier in the day and the trial poised for opening statements in Wilmington, Delaware. Dominion had sought 1.6 billion in damages in the lawsuit filed in 2021. Dominion CEO John Poulos called the settlement historic. Fox has admitted to telling lies about Dominion that caused enormous damage to my company, our employees and our customers, Poulos said in a statement. Truthful reporting in the media is essential to our democracy, Poulos said. At issue in the lawsuit was whether Fox was liable for airing the false claims that Denver-based Dominions ballot-counting machines were used to manipulate the presidential election in favor of Democrat Joe Biden over then-President Donald Trump, a Republican. Tuesdays settlement spared Fox the peril of having some of its best-known figures called to the witness stand and subjected to potentially withering questioning, including executives such as Rupert Murdoch, the 92-year-old who serves as Fox Corp chairman, as well as on-air hosts Tucker Carlson, Sean Hannity and Jeanine Pirro. Fox anchor Neil Cavuto broke into his news show Your World about 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time to report the settlement. A statement by Fox was read on air. We are pleased to have reached a settlement of our dispute with Dominion Voting Systems, the statement said. We acknowledge the Courts rulings finding certain claims about Dominion to be false. This settlement reflects FOXs continued commitment to the highest journalistic standards. We are hopeful that our decision to resolve this dispute with Dominion amicably, instead of the acrimony of a divisive trial, allows the country to move forward from these issues. FOX HAS BILLIONS IN CASH Shares of Fox Corp closed up slightly at 34 per share, but were down 1 in after-hours trading following disclosure of the settlement amount. Fox has cash on hand to pay for a settlement. It committed 3 billion to buy back shares in the first quarter after revenues beat estimates. Fox Corp CEO Lachlan Murdoch told Wall Street analysts in February that the company had about 4 billion cash on hand. Dominion lawyers declined to answer questions about whether Fox News would apologize publicly or make changes. Fox News is the most-watched U.S. cable news network. The settlement of 787.5 million is the largest amount of money paid to conclude an American media libel case, said Richard Tofel, principal of Gallatin Advisory. The previously highest payment occurred in 2017 when Walt Disney Co paid 177 million, in addition to insurance recoveries, to settle the pink slime defamation case against its ABC network by Beef Products Inc. Dominion sued Fox Corp and Fox News, contending that its business was ruined by the false vote-rigging claims that were aired by the news outlet known for its roster of conservative commentators. The trial was to have tested whether Foxs coverage crossed the line between ethical journalism and the pursuit of ratings, as Dominion alleged and Fox denied. Fox had portrayed itself in the pretrial skirmishing as a defender of press freedom. Delaware Superior Court Judge Eric Davis, presiding over the case, had ordered a one-day trial postponement on Monday. Fox was pursuing settlement talks, two sources familiar with the matter said. Davis delayed the trial on Tuesday, as the two sides appeared to hammer out the deal in private. The primary question for jurors was to be whether Fox knowingly spread false information or recklessly disregarded the truth, the standard of actual malice that Dominion must show to prevail in a defamation case. In February court filings, Dominion cited a trove of internal communications in which Murdoch and other Fox figures privately acknowledged that the vote-rigging claims made about Dominion on-air were false. Dominion said Fox amplified the untrue claims to boost its ratings and prevent its viewers from migrating to other media competitors on the right. ANOTHER LAWSUIT PENDING Adding to the legal risks for Fox, another U.S. voting technology company, Smartmatic, is pursuing its own defamation lawsuit seeking 2.7 billion in damages in a New York state court. For many plaintiffs, a court holding, and admission by the defendant about falsity, are even more important than any actual money damages, said Mary-Rose Papandrea, a constitutional law professor at the University of North Carolina School of Law. Fox had earlier argued that claims by Trump and his lawyers about the election were inherently newsworthy and protected by the U.S. Constitutions First Amendment. Davis ruled in March that Fox could not use those arguments as a defense, finding its coverage was false, defamatory and not protected by the First Amendment. The lawsuit referenced instances in which Trump allies including his former lawyers Rudolph Giuliani and Sidney Powell appeared on Fox News to advance the false allegations. Murdoch internally described the election-rigging claims as really crazy and damaging but declined to wield his editorial power to stop them and conceded under oath that some Fox hosts nonetheless endorsed the baseless claims, Dominion told the court in a filing. Under questioning from a Dominion lawyer, Murdoch testified that he thought everything about the election was on the up-and-up and doubted the rigging claims from the very beginning, according to Dominions filing. Asked if he could have intervened to stop Giuliani from continuing to spread falsehoods on air, Murdoch responded, I could have. But I didnt, the filing said. Source - Reuters -Agencies",

        "date": "April 19, 2023 10:46 am",
        "content": "A Gazette notification has been issued by all District Returning Officers stating that the 2023 Local Government (LG) election cannot be held on 25 April as scheduled. Accordingly, a new date will be announced once the Treasury releases the required funds, or the Supreme Court gives a decision with regard to the pending case. A date for the 2023 LG polls will be decided based on either the availability of funds or the court order pertaining to the matter, whichever occurs first. Following the 2018 Local Government polls, which saw the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) securing a majority of the seats, the next election was originally scheduled to be held last year. However, the local elections were deferred indefinitely due to the exacerbated economic situation and the political instability in the country, while the term of office of local government bodies was extended for a period of one year. Eventually, the election was planned to be held on 09 March and the Printing Department and the Election Commission made repeated requests from the Treasury, seeking funds to prepare for the Local Govt polls. However, printing of ballot papers stalled without sufficient funds. Accordingly, the election was put off to 25 April only to be deferred once again. Against this backdrop, the Supreme Court, on 03 March, issued an interim order, preventing the Treasury Secretary Mahinda Siriwardana from withholding budgetary allocations made for the Local Govt election. Later, several government MPs including Premnath C. Dolawatte alleged that the Supreme Courts interim order on the Local Government elections is a breach of parliamentary privileges. However, the move attracted widespread criticism, with many deeming it an attempt to postpone the election on the part of the government. Meanwhile, the term of office of 340 out of the 341 local government bodies, which was extended by one year, expired at midnight on 19 March. After the tenure of the local government bodies expires, the authority of 29 municipal councils will be transferred to the municipal commissioners, while the authority of the 36 municipal councils and the 275 local councils is transferred to the secretaries of relevant institutions.",

        "title": "Indian Supreme Court hears historic same sex marriage case",
        "date": "April 19, 2023 12:05 pm",
        "content": "The Indian Supreme Court is hearing final arguments on a number of petitions seeking to legalise same-sex marriage. The hearings are being livestreamed in public interest. With same sex couples and LGBTQ activists hoping for a judgement in their favour and the government and religious leaders strongly opposing same sex union, the debate is turning out to be a lively one. Both sides have been forcefully putting forth their views. Lawyers for the petitioners have said that marriage is a union of two people - not just a man and woman. They have argued that laws should be changed to reflect that concepts of marriage have changed over time and that same sex couples also desire the respectability of marriage. But Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, whos representing the government, has questioned the courts right to hear the matter at all. He says its not an issue to be decided by five individuals - the judges - and only the parliament can discuss the socio-legal issue of marriage. The court has told both sides to finish arguments by Thursday. Among those keenly watching the proceedings are Dr Kavita Arora and Ankita Khanna, a same sex couple whove been waiting for years to tie the knot. For Kavita and Ankita, it wasnt love at first sight. The women first became co-workers, then friends, and then came love. Their families and friends readily accepted their relationship, but 17 years after they met and more than a decade after they started living together, the mental health professionals say they are unable to marry - something most couples aspire to. The two are among 18 couples who have petitioned the Supreme Court to allow same sex marriage in India. At least three of the petitions have been filed by couples who are raising children together. Chief Justice DY Chandrachud called it a matter of seminal importance and set up a five-judge constitutional bench - which deals with important questions of law - to rule on it. The debate is important in a country which is home to an estimated tens of millions of LGBTQ people. In 2012, the Indian government put their population at 2.5 million, but calculations using global estimates believe it to be at least 10 of the entire population - or more than 135 million. Over the years, acceptance of homosexuality has also grown in India. A Pew survey in 2020 had 37 people saying it should be accepted - an increase of 22 from 15 in 2014, the first time the question was asked in the country. But despite the change, attitudes to sex and sexuality remain largely conservative and activists say most LGBTQ people are afraid to come out, even to their friends and family, and attacks on same sex couples routinely make headlines. So a lot of attention is focussed on what happens in the top court in the coming days - a favourable decision will make India the 35th country in the world to legalise same sex union and set off momentous changes in society. A lot of other laws, such as those governing adoption, divorce and inheritance, will also have to be rejigged. Ankita and Kavita say they hope it will happen, because that will make it possible for them to marry. Ankita, a therapist, and Kavita, a psychiatrist, together run a clinic that works with children and young adults with mental health issues and learning disabilities. On 23 September 2020, they applied to get married. We were at that stage in our relationship where we were thinking about marriage. Also, we were tired of fighting the system each time we wanted something done - such as get a joint bank account or a health insurance policy, own a house together, or write a will. One incident that proved a catalyst was when Ankitas mother needed an emergency surgery but Kavita, who had accompanied her to the hospital, says she couldnt sign the consent form because I couldnt say I was her daughter, nor could I say I was her daughter-in-law. But on 30 September, when they went to the magistrates office in their area, seeking to solemnise their marriage, they were turned away. The couple then petitioned the Delhi high court, seeking legalisation of same sex marriage - and a direction to the authorities to register their wedding. After a number of similar petitions were filed by same-sex couples in the Supreme Court and across high courts in India, the top court in January bunched them together and said it will deliberate the important issue. In their petition, filed through senior lawyers Menaka Guruswamy and Arundhati Katju, Ankita and Kavita say what we seek is not the right to be left alone, but the right to be acknowledged as equals. The Indian constitution, their petition adds, gives all citizens the right to marry a person of their choice and prohibits discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and their petition should be allowed since constitutional morality is above social morality. Im very optimistic and have great faith in the judiciary, Ms Guruswamy, whose team is representing six same-sex union cases in court, told the BBC. Some of her optimism come from reading the December 2018 judgement that decriminalised gay sex - the thing that struck me most was that the court emphasised the right to choice of partner and that makes me very optimistic, she said. While striking down the colonial-era law, the judges also said that history owed an apology to LGBT people and their families for the ignominy and ostracism they have faced. But considering the opposition to same sex marriage from the government and religious leaders, Ms Guruswamy has a tough fight on her hands. The Indian government has urged the top court to reject the petitions, saying that a marriage could take place only between a man and a woman who are heterosexual. Living together as partners and sexual relationships by same sex individuals ... are not comparable with the Indian family unit concept of a husband, a wife and children, the law ministry argued in a filing in the court. It added that the court cannot be asked to change the entire legislative policy of the country deeply embedded in religious and societal norms and that matter should be left to be debated in the parliament. On Sunday, the government submitted another 102-page document in court saying that the petitions merely reflect urban elitist views and that any court decision to recognise same-sex marriage would mean a virtual judicial rewriting of an entire branch of law. In a rare show of unity, leaders from all of Indias main religions - Hindu, Muslim, Jain, Sikh and Christian - also opposed same sex union, with several of them insisting that marriage is for procreation, not recreation. And last month, 21 retired high court judges also weighed in on the subject. Legalisation of same-sex marriage would have a devastating impact on children, family and society, they wrote in an open letter. The judges added that allowing same-sex marriage could increase incidence of HIV-Aids in India and expressed concern that it could negatively affect the psychological and emotional development of children raised by same-sex couples. But last weekend, the petitioners received a major boost when Indian Psychiatric Society (IPS) - the countrys leading mental health group which represents more than 7,000 psychiatrists - issued a statement in their support. Homosexuality is not a disease, the IPS said in a statement, adding that discrimination against LGBTQ people could lead to mental health issues in them. The IPS statement carries some heft - in 2018, the organisation had released a similar statement supporting decriminalising gay sex and the Supreme Court had referred to it in their judgement. I ask Ankita and Kavita what they think will happen in court? We know that the constitution was framed to allow for equality and diversity and our faith in judiciary and constitution is unwavering, says Ankita. Adds Kavita: We knew there would be opposition, we knew this wasnt going to be a cakewalk. But we chose to undertake this journey, this is what we started, lets see where it takes us.

        "date": "April 19, 2023 03:09 pm",
        "content": "A four-story parking facility collapsed in New York Citys lower Manhattan near Pace University and the New York Stock Exchange on Tuesday, killing at least one worker and injuring five others who were inside the structure, authorities said. Emergency personnel using robotic devices after firefighters were pulled back from the fallen structure due to unstable conditions checked the site for any further casualties, but officials said they believed all victims had been accounted for. No foul play was suspected. We have no reason to believe that this was anything other than a structural collapse, City Police Commissioner Keechant Sewell told reporters. Reuters video footage from the scene, in Manhattans financial district blocks from the World Trade Center and New York Stock Exchange, showed a rescue operation getting underway and multiple cars stacked on top of one another amid crumpled slabs of concrete. One person was pronounced dead on the scene, four more were taken to area hospitals for injuries and a sixth individual who was hurt declined medical treatment, said John Esposito, chief of fire operations for the New York City Fire Department. He described all six as workers who were in the parking structure when it collapsed. This was an extremely dangerous situation for our firefighters, he told a late-afternoon news briefing. Esposito said firefighters ordered out of the structure had still been inside conducting searches as the building was continuing to collapse. Robot devices were then deployed, he said, marking the first time city firefighters had flown a drone aircraft into a fallen building to conduct a search. Pace University, a private college campus whose students, faculty and staff use the parking structure, was evacuated as a precaution, authorities said. This building is completely unstable, New York City Mayor Eric Adams told reporters. The New York City Department of Buildings online records showed that the structure, at the site of the collapse had been cited for 45 violations, including 25 since 2003, many related to its elevators. One 2003 filing noted that ceiling slab cracks exist as well as defective concrete with exposed rear cracks. It said an 800 penalty had been paid for the violation. Eyewitnesses said the collapse was swift and without warning. It all happened so fast, said Thai Nguyen, 35, who lives in Chinatown and is a manager of the nearby Kollective Klub. Our store is two buildings from the parking garage, and we also have a hotel next to us. People ran inside asking if they could take refuge inside our store. Sandy Imhoff, 78, who lives in an adjacent apartment on the same street, said she fled her home with her two cats when her building began to shudder from the force of the collapse. My building was shaking. I only had time to grab my dog and leave the building, Imhoff said. Im really worried about my cats. But at least everyone in my building was able to evacuate. Its so unreal.

        "content": "Former President Maithripala Sirisena says that only the judiciary or the Chief Justice has the authority to implement the law against him with regard to the Easter Sunday terror attack and that Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith has no such authority. The former President, who visited the Temple of Tooth Relic in Kandy today (April 19), made these comments while responding to questions from the media. In response to a question raised by a journalist, whether he will contest the presidential election, Sirisena claimed that they are still not aware of as to when an election will be held and what kind of election will be held. That is decided by the President and the Election Commission. We adapt accordingly. Until then, I will stand up for the people and carry on those activities for the sake of our country and the people, he said. Meanwhile, ex-president Sirisena was also asked as to whether he is prepared to pay the compensation for the Easter Attack victims as ordered by the court. Lets wait and see. We must do what the court orders. We have to respect that. Further, the former president also replied to a journalist who raised a question regarding the Cardinal Ranjiths recent comments that strict legal actions must be taken if the compensation payment is not made. He is not the Chief Justice. The court decides that, Sirisena said.",

        "title": "India population to surpass China mid-year: U.N. estimates",
        "date": "April 19, 2023 04:11 pm",
        "content": "India is set to overtake China as the worlds most populous country by mid-year with almost three million more people, United Nations estimates showed on April 19. Indias population will be 1.4286 billion compared to Chinas 1.4257 billion at mid-year, the United Nations Population Funds State of World Population report showed. The number of people in China shrank last year for the first time since 1960, when millions starved to death under the disastrous agricultural policies of former leader Mao Zedong. Many have blamed the slowdown on the soaring cost of living as well as the growing number of women going into the workforce and seeking higher education. Beijing ended its strict one-child policy, imposed in the 1980s amid overpopulation fears, in 2016 and started letting couples have three children in 2021. China faces a looming demographic decline as birth rates plunge and its workforce ages. Several regions have also announced plans to boost birth rates - but official efforts have so far failed to reverse the decline. India has no recent official data on how many people it has because it has not conducted a census since 2011. Indias once in a decade census was due to be held in 2021 but was delayed due to the coronavirus pandemic. It is now bogged down by logistical hurdles and political reluctance, making it unlikely the massive exercise will begin anytime soon. Critics say the government is deliberately delaying the census to hide data on contentious issues such as unemployment ahead of national elections next year. The economy under Prime Minister Narendra Modi is struggling to provide jobs for the millions of young people entering the job market every year. Half of the population of the Asian giant are under 30. The country also faces huge challenges providing electricity, food and housing for its growing population, with many of its huge cities already struggling to cope. According to the Pew Research Centre, Indias population has grown by more than one billion people since 1950, the year the U.N. began gathering population data. 8 billion The new U.N. report also estimated that the global population will have hit 8.045 billion by mid-2023. Other countries, mostly in Europe and Asia, can expect a demographic slump over the coming decades, according to other U.N. figures published last July which forecast how the worlds population will develop between now and 2100. A different picture is emerging in Africa, where the population is expected to rise from 1.4 to 3.9 billion inhabitants by 2100, with some 38 of Earth dwellers living there, against around 18 today. Eight nations of more than 10 million inhabitants, most of them in Europe, saw their populations shrink over the past decade. Japan is also seeing a decline due to its ageing population, losing more than three million inhabitants between 2011 and 2021. The population of the entire planet, meanwhile, is only expected to decline in the 2090s, after peaking at 10.4 billion, according to the U.N. Source - AFP -Agencies",

No one is going to hold the education of children as hostage. That I am not allowing. That cant be allowed, he emphasized, addressing the progress review meeting of the Education Ministry at the Presidential Secretariat this morning (19). The President said he is thinking of making education, especially examinations, a compulsory service or to also establish an examinations committee for the General Certificate of Education (GCE). The Presidents discussion with education officials focused on the prevailing issue concerning the delay in paper-marking of the 2022 G.C.E. Advanced Level examination due to teachers and university lecturers deciding to withdraw from those services. The President instructed the officials present to inquire from the Education Minister as to whether the university lecturers are willing to correct the papers or not. Why cant you mark it with all the teachers available? Look if they dont come they dont come. Thats not an answer I can give in parliament. I am asking you give me an answer that I can tell the country and parliament, he told the officials. He further said: Now if its marked by the teachers and not marked by the dons, what happens? Anyway the minister has now said there is a political force behind it. So now you have to go from there. If the FUTA says they are not a political force then itll get dragged on some more. One is, I am thinking of making education, especially examinations, a compulsory service. Other can shout, in the country it will be the most popular thing. And then secondly, an exams committee. A G.C.E. exams committee. Both those I will put it by emergency and then you can bring the legislation. So one of the two, tell me. All those who marked the papers last time must be available for service now. If not I will prosecute them and take their property off. So its not a question of moratorium, youll be bankrupt. Thats all. You cant stop the education of children, no? What nonsense is this? So anyway work out one of the two and tell me. Thats all. By next week I must tell the AG to be ready with the emergency regulations. Lets see which MP is going to vote against it. Ill ask for a vote by name. So, tell them these are the two options. If you dont come back and want to have a confrontation, we are willing to come for a confrontation. But no one is going to hold the education of children as hostage. That I am not allowing. That cant be allowed. Forget the labour law. Dont worry of those. I want to start the exams and the schools, so dont talk to me about the labour law. Thatll come later. Yall must come up with a solution end of this week. If you dont have one, I will take it up in Cabinet and then we will decide what to do. Speak to the Minister. Then we will have a meeting this week and decide. Now the minister has also made a statement, we cant go back on it. And we can only go forward.",

        "date": "April 19, 2023 09:11 pm",
        "content": "Malaysias immigration department took down a syndicate smuggling Sri Lankan children to Europe using Malaysian passports with the arrest of a local couple in Kuala Lumpur on Wednesday. Immigration department director-general Ruslin Jusoh said the syndicate known as Bahnu Internationals operated using Malaysian parents from poor families with children under 12 years old to manipulate their personal information. He said the syndicate would trick the parents into bringing their childrens birth certificates to the immigration office as if they were making Malaysian passports for their children. However, during the application process at the immigration counter, Sri Lankan children close to the age of their children would instead be brought to the counter for the purpose of getting fingerprints and photos. The husband and wife would then act as a transporter by taking the Sri Lankan children with Malaysian passports to Europe, he said in a statement today. It is understood that the parents were paid RM500 to attend with their childs documents at the office to be used for the Sri Lankan children involved. Ruslin said based on preliminary investigations, the syndicate received wages of 30,000 to 50,000 for each Sri Lankan child that had their Malaysian passport done and was escorted to Europe. Investigations are still underway to track and identify how long this syndicate has been operating and how many children have been involved. The syndicate was successfully busted when the couple went to the Kuala Lumpur Immigration Department for the purpose of obtaining a Malaysian passport for a Sri Lankan child, he added. He said the arrest of the couple was the result of the swift action of the immigration officers at the passport division who had noticed something was off when interviewing a child as there was a significant difference in appearance with the guardian while the child could not speak Malay. Ruslin said the couple, aged 37 and 26, were brought to court on charges under Section 26A of the Anti-Trafficking in Persons and Anti-Smuggling of Migrants Act 2007 at the Sessions Court today. The immigration department has advised the public not to be easily manipulated by the offers and tricks of such syndicates. If any doubts relating to immigration matters arise, the public can refer to the department or get the latest information through its website and official social media accounts, he said.

Embilipitiya District General Hospital is one of the major hospitals available for the people living not only in Ratnapura but also in Hambantota, Matale and Monaragala districts. The situation has arisen as a result of the recent expatriation of the two anaesthesiologists who were attached to the hospital. Although another anaesthesiologist was temporarily assigned to replace the expatriated doctors, she, too, has reportedly left for an overseas training. In view of this situation, the director of the hospital is compelled to transfer the hospitalized patients to other hospitals for surgeries and intensive care treatment. Meanwhile, the local residents allege that there is no way of performing an emergency caesarean surgery at the hospital at present.

        "date": "April 19, 2023 10:13 pm",
        "content": "The last time emerging markets faced a major debt crisis, in the 1990s, influential creditors, named after traditional centres of diplomacy and finance, could quickly gather in private to agree a solution. These days, bringing together a more diverse group of lenders has proved a more cumbersome exercise. The Paris Clubs members are the mostly western nations that used to dominate bilateral lending. But their contributions are dwarfed by China, which now lends more to the worlds poorest countries than all other bilateral creditors put together. The London Club of commercial banks has lost its relevance, with borrowers increasingly raising finance on bond markets. These shifts have meant creditors positions are far less aligned. As Anna Gelpern, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, puts it, new entrants are just not embedded in the clubby set-up of the past. Whats replaced the clubs is a blame game, where critics accuse China of lending on terms that give it hidden advantage over other lenders. As its loans have soured, the country has become an alternative lender of last resort, challenging the IMF and stymying restructuring negotiations by trying to impose its own terms. For those in default  such as Zambia, Sri Lanka, Ghana and others  the lack of an informal club has meant debt restructurings have been frustratingly slow, taking years in some cases. More sovereign issuers are likely to suffer a similar fate soon as higher global borrowing costs and weak growth push them into insolvency. Finding the right approach to break the debt deadlock will be hard to achieve, analysts said, with much depending on Beijing. In the past week, it has appeared to soften its opposition to collegiate action. It may even have dropped its insistence that multilateral development banks should join other creditors in writing down the value of their loans. That proposal, which would raise the funding costs of the World Bank and other development banks, is widely seen as a non-starter by economists and western governments. Such a change in Chinas position, says Clemence Landers, senior fellow at the Center for Global Development think-tank, would be an important and long-overdue breakthrough. The Group of 20 large economies  of which China is a member  has come up with a Common Framework. However, only four countries have signed up: Zambia, Chad, Ethiopia and Ghana. In part, thats because the framework obliges debtors to seek the same treatment from all creditors, including those in the private sector  something that many sovereigns are keen to avoid for fear of damaging their creditworthiness. Bondholders, meanwhile, say they are being kept in the dark. Kevin Daly, a director at Abrdn, an asset manager, says the IMFs assessment of a debtor countrys needs should be shared with all creditors including bondholders from the start, and not only after bilateral creditors including China have reached a deal. In Zambia, for example, he notes that, as creditors, bondholders are as big as Beijing. Were trying to come up with ideas to speed things up but we lost months of lead time, he said. Yet were not the ones who lent recklessly on opaque terms. Some say the recent leaking of the IMFs criteria for a deal in Sri Lanka offers a precedent for greater transparency for the private sector. That bondholders got sight of what to expect early on with no harm done to the negotiations reinforces the case for making it a habit. Another way of speeding things along would be to substantially increase the funding available from multilateral development banks, enabling them to provide more grants or concessional loans, rather than outright debt relief, to countries in distress. Ways of doing this are under active discussion. In what looks like an attempt to revive the clubby meetings of the past, the IMF, World Bank and G20 have tried to corral all creditors into a new initiative. The Global Sovereign Debt Roundtable met in Washington last week  with both China and members of the Paris Club participating in the talks, alongside private-sector representatives. Little progress was made. Even with more creditors around the same table, effective action will be slow. But for now, with no other workable solutions on offer, borrowers and lenders hope the forum will be given a chance to succeed. Source - Financial Times -Agencies",

        "date": "April 19, 2023 10:27 pm",
        "content": "Rotaract Club of Alumni of University of Moratuwa has organized En Vogue 2.0, a Beeralu-making workshop in collaboration with Nifty Looms. The workshop was organized after receiving multiple requests at the start of the RI Year 2022-23 to conduct a physical workshop for En Vogue 1.0, a newly initiated program It was held in two phases, with phase 1 taking place at the National Craft Council premises from the 21 to 23 December, and phase 2 from the 25 to 26 March as a physical event. The focus of the phase was to provide young designers with hands-on experience in ancient crafts in Sri Lanka, as learning these crafts on their own can be challenging due to time and cost constraints. The organizers selected Beeralu Weaving as the first technique to be taught, as it requires a significant amount of time for practice and skill development. Beeralu is a traditional craft in Sri Lanka that involves making handmade lace work using threads and a Beeralu pillow. The art form was introduced to Sri Lankans by the Portuguese and the Dutch during their respective periods of rule in the country. Over the years, Sri Lanka has developed many crafts, and the techniques and designs for Beeralu have been passed down from generation to generation. The art form is particularly popular in the southern region of Sri Lanka. The main objective of the Beeralu Making workshop organized by Rotaract Club of Alumni of University of Moratuwa was to teach the ancient Beeralu craft to the younger generation of Sri Lanka in order to preserve it for future generations. The workshop also provided an affordable and flexible opportunity to learn new fabric-making techniques for current undergraduates and for those who are interested in learning new craft skills, despite their busy schedules. As per the participants request, a basic workshop will be organized on 29 and 30 April. The workshop is open to anyone interested in attending. In the upcoming RI year, the focus will be on conducting an advanced workshop with participants who completed phase 1, 2, and 3. Additionally, workshops will be conducted for school children with the aim of producing more artisans across the country. The workshop was conducted under the guidance of Stella Edirisinghe, a renowned instructor in the field. Her institution, Nifty Looms, partnered with the organizers to support the cause. With Edirisinghes valuable support, the workshop was able to provide a better experience for the participants, allowing them to create great memories as future designers. A PR campaign was organized by the organizers to raise awareness about the workshop. Members conducted the campaign, which led to reaching out to four major institutions where fashion undergraduates learn. A total of 18 enthusiastic participants attended the entire workshop series, which provided them with all the necessary raw materials and Beeralu machines. Upon completion, participants were awarded e-certificates. During the workshop, participants were educated on the history of Beeralu-making practices, as well as the fundamental practical lessons they needed to master. The Beeralu workshop was successfully concluded, with positive feedback received from the participants, and a new request to organize an advanced workshop in the future. The workshop also provided the organizers with the opportunity to connect and create partnerships with seven different institutions and participants from various cities and districts in Sri Lanka. The organizers efforts towards preserving ancient valuable craft practices are expected to benefit many designers, especially as the techniques gradually fade away with the fast-forwarding developments in the field. It is vital to preserve these techniques and bring them up to date with modern trends. The organizers said they are pleased to have contributed to paving the way for someones dream of becoming a fashionista while volunteering and making new bonds with learning experiences. They will continue to strive to come up with more valuable and creative projects in the future.",

        "date": "April 20, 2023 07:53 am",
        "content": "SANAA, Yemen (AP)  A crowd apparently spooked by gunfire and an electrical explosion stampeded at an event to distribute financial aid during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan in Yemens capital late Wednesday, killing at least 78 people and injuring at least 73 others, according to witnesses and Houthi rebel officials. The tragedy was the deadliest in years that was not related to Yemens long conflict, and came ahead of the Muslim holiday of Eid al-Fitr, which marks the end of Ramadan later this week. Armed Houthis fired into the air in an attempt at crowd control, apparently striking an electrical wire and causing it to explode, according to two witnesses, Abdel-Rahman Ahmed and Yahia Mohsen. That sparked a panic, and people, including many women and children, began stampeding, they said. Video posted on social media showed dozens of bodies, some motionless, and others screaming as people tried to help. Separate footage of the aftermath released by Houthi officials showed bloodstains, shoes and victims clothing scattered on the ground. Investigators were seen examining the area. The crush took place in the Old City in the center of Sanaa, where hundreds of poor people had gathered for a charity event organized by merchants, according to the Houthi-run Interior Ministry. Distributing financial aid is a ritual during Ramadan, when the faithful fast from dawn to dusk. People had gathered to receive about 10 each from a charity funded by local businessmen, witnesses said. Wealthy people and businessmen often hand out cash and food, especially to the poor during Ramadan. Interior Ministry spokesperson Brig. Abdel-Khaleq al-Aghri, blamed the crush on the random distribution of funds without coordination with local authorities. Motaher al-Marouni, a senior health official, said 78 people were killed, according the rebels Al-Masirah satellite TV channel. At least 73 others were injured and taken to the al-Thowra Hospital in Sanaa, according to hospital deputy director Hamdan Bagheri. The rebels quickly sealed off a school where the event was being held and barred people, including journalists, from approaching. The Interior Ministry said it had detained two organizers and an investigation was under way. The Houthis said they would pay some 2,000 in compensation to each family who lost a relative, while the injured would get around 400. Yemens capital has been under the control of the Iranian-backed Houthis since they descended from their northern stronghold in 2014 and removed the internationally recognized government. That prompted a Saudi-led coalition to intervene in 2015 to try to restore the government. The conflict has turned in recent years into a proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Iran, killing more than 150,000 people, including fighters and civilians and creating one of the worlds worst humanitarian disasters. More than 21 million people in Yemen, or two-thirds of the countrys population, need help and protection, according to the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. Among those in need, more than 17 million are considered particularly vulnerable. In February the United Nations said it had raised only 1.2 billion out of a target of 4.3 billion at a conference aimed at generating funds to ease the humanitarian crisis. Source: AP --Agencies",

        "content": "K-pop star Moonbin has died at the age of 25, his record label has announced. He was found unresponsive by his manager at his apartment in Seoul on Wednesday night, South Korean media quoted police as saying. He appears to have taken his own life but an autopsy is being reviewed to determine the exact cause of death, police said. Moonbin unexpectedly left our world and became a star in the sky, a tribute from his label Fantiago said. Moonbin had been an actor and model before joining the boy band Astro in 2016, a well-established K-pop group. He also performed with a sub-group called Moonbin  Sanha. The statement from Fantagio asked that everyone refrain from speculative and malicious reports so that his family could pay their respects in peace. Moonbin joined the Fantagios trainee program as a child before eventually joining Astro. The group was originally six performers, but one member left in February 2023. His sister Moon Sua is also a K-pop singer, performing as part of the girl group Billlie. Moonbin is the latest K-pop star to lose their life in recent years:  Singer and actress Goo Hara was found dead at her home in Seoul in 2019. Her close friend, K-pop star Sulli, killed herself after a long struggle with online bullying in the same year  In 2018, Minwoo of boy band 100 died at home, with his label only saying he had suffered cardiac arrest  Jonghyun, a member of one of South Koreas biggest boy bands, SHINee, passed away in 2017. South Korea has the highest rate of youth suicide of all developed countries and while the countrys overall suicide rate is falling, deaths of those in their 20s are rising. The government is trying to substantially reduce the number of suicides, which plague Koreas hyper-competitive society. Moonbins fans have been mourning his death, while praising him for introducing them to the hugely popular K-Pop genre. Source: BBC -Agencies",

        "date": "April 20, 2023 10:25 am",
        "content": "People all over the world lost confidence in the importance of routine childhood vaccines against killer diseases like measles and polio during the COVID-19 pandemic, according to a new report from UNICEF. In 52 of the 55 countries surveyed, the public perception of vaccines for children declined between 2019 and 2021, the UN agency said. The data was a worrying warning signal of rising vaccine hesitancy amid misinformation, dwindling trust in governments and political polarisation, UNICEF, the United Nations Childrens Fund, said. We cannot allow confidence in routine immunizations to become another victim of the pandemic, Catherine Russell, UNICEF executive director, said in a statement. Otherwise, the next wave of deaths could be of more children with measles, diphtheria or other preventable diseases. The change in perception was particularly worrying, the agency said, as it comes after the largest sustained backslide in childhood immunization in a generation during COVID disruptions. In total, 67 million children missed out on one or more potentially lifesaving vaccines during the pandemic, and efforts to catch up have so far stalled despite increasing outbreaks. The picture on vaccine confidence varied globally, according to the UNICEF report, its flagship annual State of the Worlds Children. In countries including Papua New Guinea and South Korea, agreement with the statement vaccines are important for children declined by 44, and by more than a third in Ghana, Senegal and Japan. In the United States, it declined by 13.6 percentage points. In India, China and Mexico, confidence remained broadly the same or increased, the report added. The report stressed that vaccine confidence can easily shift and the results may not indicate a long-term trend. Despite the fall in confidence, more than 80 of respondents in almost half of the countries surveyed still said childhood vaccines were important. The data was collected by the Vaccine Confidence Project at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. Source - Reuters -Agencies",

        "date": "April 20, 2023 12:19 pm",
        "content": "The Federation of University Teachers Associations (FUTA) says that it does not approve the presidents decision to make education an essential service in order to avoid professional issues in the field. The Chairman of FUTA, Prof. Shyama Banneheka said that it is important for the authorities to work effectively to resolve the problems in the education sector. Speaking at the Education Ministrys progress review meeting held at the Presidential Secretariat on Wednesday, the President said he is thinking of making education, especially examinations, a compulsory service under the emergency law, if the teachers further refuse to take part in paper-marking of the 2022 G.C.E. Advanced Level examination. When inquired by Ada Derana in this regard, Prof. Shyama Banneheka said he is, nevertheless, delighted that the education sector has received attention from top-level authorities in the country amidst the prevailing issues. He said, however, a specific service should be made an essential service in consideration of the importance of the relevant sector and the services that can be provided to the people of the country. A service should not be declared essential in a bid to avoid the issues prevalent in the relevant sector when a group of professionals voices their concerns. From time to time in the recent past, it was common to declare certain sectors as essential services in an attempt to intimidate the employees or to force them to come to work, he stressed. Making a service an essential service based on such purposes cannot be approved. Prof. Banneheka, also emphasized that there are many other major problems in the education sector, adding that university lecturers are of the opinion that it would be better to resolve these issues before declaring the education sector an essential service. He further commented on the paper-marking activities of the 2022 G.C.E. Advanced Level examination. We withdrew from those activities temporarily, hoping for some relief to this tax issue. So we have a hope that we will receive at least a temporary relief. It is evident that there have been some positive signs, he said. Prof. Banneheka, who mentioned that the Executive Committee of the FUTA takes all the decisions regarding the matter, added that they are preparing to do their best over next few days, following an executive committee meeting.",

Semasinghe made this statement at the United Nations Development Programmes (UNDP) Tax for SDGs Initiative yesterday (19 April), titled SDGs and Taxation: Lessons Learned and Best Practices from the Ground. He further emphasised that enhancing government revenue and expenditure containment would complement efforts made towards fiscal consolidation, adding that measures to reduce the operational expenses of the government and increase the accountability of the appropriation of public funds are important. Sri Lankas State Minister of Finance noted, however, that the rationalization of public funds should not and would not compromise the allocation of financial provision for health, education and social protection. Meanwhile, delivering a statement at the 2023 United Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) Financing for Development (FfD) Forum, State Minister Semasinghe spoke of the crisis Sri Lanka is currently recovering from. Commenting on Sri Lankas unprecedented crisis, Semasinghe stated that he believes that it, the crisis, presented an opportunity to regain economic stability with meaningful fiscal reforms and a renewed governance structure that would effectively address contemporary challenges. Thus, during his statement on Fostering debt sustainability by addressing gaps in the sovereign debt architecture, Semasinghe stated that it is time to take collective action to close longstanding gaps in sovereign debt and ensure reforms in the international financial architecture. Taking to Twitter, he explained that this would allow for countries to have greater fiscal space, and would thereby ensure that the vicious cycle of debt and default does not repeat itself.",

The decision was reached at the meeting of Committee on Parliamentary Business convened this morning (April 20). The meeting was chaired by Deputy Speaker of Parliament Ajith Rajapakse. The proposal submits that the Ministry of Finance, Economic Stabilization  National Policies should provide all necessary approvals for the implementation of the said set-up, however, a vote is to be followed post the three-day debate if necessary, the Communications Department said further. On 20 March 2023, the Executive Board of the IMF green-lighted a 48-month extended arrangement under the EFF program of SDR 2.286 billion (approximately USD 3 billion) for Sri Lanka. The EFF program will allow Sri Lanka to access financing of up to USD 7 billion from the IMF, international financial institutions and multilateral organizations. The program is expected to provide much-needed policy space to drive the economy out of the unprecedented challenges and instill confidence amongst all the stakeholders. After receiving the IMFs board approval, Sri Lanka immediately received an initial disbursement of USD 333 million (amounting to SDR 254 million) from the EFF arrangement, which is expected to catalyze new external financing including from the ADB and the World Bank.

        "content": "South Asia is home to highest number of child brides in the world as increased financial pressures and school closures due to COVID-19 forced families to marry off their young daughters, according to new estimates released by UNICEF on Wednesday. There were 290 million child brides in the region, accounting for 45 of the global total, the childrens agency of the United Nations said, calling for more efforts to end the practice. The fact that South Asia has the highest child marriage burden in the world is nothing short of tragic, said Noala Skinner, UNICEFs regional director for South Asia, said in a statement. Child marriage locks girls out of learning, puts their health and wellbeing at risk and compromises their future. Every girl who gets married as a child is one girl too many. A new study by the agency that also included interviews and discussions across 16 locations in Bangladesh, India and Nepal found that many parents saw marriage as the best option for daughters who had limited options to study during COVID lockdowns. The legal age of marriage for females is 20 in Nepal, 18 in India, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh and 16 in Afghanistan. It is 16 in Pakistan except for Sindh province, where the minimum age is 18. The U.N. study also found that families were pushed by financial strains during the pandemic to marry their daughters young in order to reduce costs at home. The agency said potential solutions identified in discussions include enacting social protection measures to counter poverty, protecting every childs right to education, ensuring an adequate framework to enforce the law and making more efforts to address social norms. We must do more and strengthen partnerships to empower girls through education, including comprehensive sexuality education, and equipping them with skills, while supporting communities to come together to end this deeply rooted practice, said Björn Andersson, Asia-Pacific regional director of the United Nations Population Fund.

        "date": "April 20, 2023 02:39 pm",
        "content": "A court in Indias western state of Gujarat has rejected Congress leader Rahul Gandhis petition seeking a stay of conviction in a defamation case, increasing uncertainty over whether he will be able to contest an election due next year. Gandhi was convicted last month in a case brought by a state legislator from Prime Minister Narendra Modis Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) after comments the Congress party leader made in a speech were deemed to be insulting to the prime minister and other people surnamed Modi. The district court in Surat city had sentenced Gandhi to two years in prison for his 2019 remarks referring to two fugitive Indian businessmen, both surnamed Modi. In an election rally that year, the 52-year-old leader had asked: How come all thieves have the name Modi? Naishadh Desai, a Congress leader and lawyer, told reporters on Thursday the Surat court has not granted a stay on Gandhis conviction. We are going to challenge the decision in Gujarat High Court tomorrow Friday. We have full faith that the judiciary will uphold justice and save the democracy, he said. While Thursdays ruling was a setback for Gandhi, his jail sentence remained suspended until he exhausts all his legal challenges to the conviction. Gandhi lost his parliament seat in March after being convicted and sentenced to two years in jail for the Modi comments. The law that governs elections in India mandates disqualification of any politician who is convicted of any offence and sentenced to imprisonment for not less than two years. Gandhi risks losing his eligibility to run in elections for the next eight years if a court does not overturn his conviction and two-year sentence. Senior Congress leader and Supreme Court lawyer Jairam Ramesh said the party would use every legal option to overturn Gandhis conviction. The defamation case against Gandhi was brought by Purnesh Modi, a BJP legislator in Gujarat, Modis home state. The BJP has repeatedly targeted the Gandhi family with allegations of corruption as part of its strategy to eliminate political threat from the Congress, and malign the reputation of a family that dominated Indian politics for decades after independence in 1947. The prosecution of Gandhi, the great-grandson of Indias first prime minister and scion of a family that has had two other prime ministers, was widely condemned by opponents of Modi as the latest assault against democracy and free speech by a government seeking to crush dissent. The speed of his removal from parliament had shocked Indian political parties and experts. Source - Al Jazeera - Agencies",

        "content": "Six persons have been arrested by the Maradana Police for attacking an individual with a sharp weapon in Maradana on Sinhala and Tamil New Year. Police also recovered a hand grenade and the sword allegedly used in the attack while in the possession of an individual identified by the alias Panchikawatte Suresh Bhai, the main suspect amongst the six arrestees. Police further revealed that the said individual was, in fact, released on bail, after having been previously arrested in connection with several crimes. A group of 12 persons, including Panchikawatte Suresh Bhai had reportedly attacked an individual on 14 April near Technical Junction in Maradana owing to a personal dispute. The victim was later admitted to the Colombo National Hospital after sustaining severe injuries. Police believe that the attack was carried out after the victim had initially assaulted a resident of the Panchikawatte area. Accordingly, a special team of police officers has been appointed in order to apprehend the other six individuals involved in the attack.",

        "date": "April 20, 2023 04:44 pm",
        "content": "Economists sharply cut Sri Lankas growth outlook through this year as curbs on imports and still-limited reserves persist even as the International Monetary Fund releases bailout loans and authorities work toward debt restructuring efforts. The economic contraction is seen more than doubling to 9.9 in the first quarter from the previous estimate of 4.4, the latest Bloomberg survey of economists showed. Growth is likely to bounce back from the second quarter though at a slower pace of 1 from an estimated 2.9 previously. For the full year, Sri Lankas gross domestic product estimate was revised to 0.7 from 2.7, the survey showed. The South Asian nation grappled with its worst economic crisis since independence last year as dollar shortages and shrinking reserves together with an infamous organic fertilizer policy led to crop failures and severe shortages of food and fuel. People took the streets to protest, eventually forcing a change in leadership as the economy almost came to a halt and inflation surged. While there are signs of stability with food and fuel imports coming in and the Washington-based lender approving a 3 billion loan, some economists say the current economic situation is nowhere close to pre-pandemic normalcy. Slower Recovery Economists see Sri Lanka to go into deeper contraction before bouncing back to growth in 2Q. Conditions are still weak but are tilted to the upside, said Andrew Vogel, an economist at SP Global. He said Sri Lanka has very little usable foreign reserves and significant restrictions on imports while a still-ongoing moratorium on external debt payments pending restructuring agreements is keeping conditions uncertain. Sri Lankas double-digit inflation, which is Asias fastest, is expected to persist through this year, the Bloomberg survey showed. Consumer prices are seen surging to around 28.8 for second quarter and averaging around 25 this year. Economists also forecast a cumulative 100 basis point hike in the benchmark rates in the second quarter, and then expect a hold at least till the end of the third quarter before the easing cycle begins. The Central Bank of Sri Lanka has kept its key rate is at the highest since August 2001 earlier this month to support growth despite price gains remaining stubbornly high at 50.3 in March. The monetary authority sees headline inflation slowing to single-digit levels by end-2023. Source  Bloomberg - Agencies",

        "title": "Sri Lankan pilgrims no longer required to pay for Hajj in forex",
        "date": "April 20, 2023 04:44 pm",
        "content": "Sri Lanka is expecting to use its full Hajj quota this year after the government lifted a 2022 policy that required pilgrims from the crisis-stricken nation to pay their travel costs in foreign currency. Only 960 pilgrims, or slightly more than half of last years quota, performed the Hajj in 2022, when Sri Lanka was gripped by the worst financial downturn since independence in 1948 and defaulted on foreign debt repayments. As the cost of sending worshippers to Makkah  estimated at 10 million  was too high for the country to bear, Muslims were allowed to perform the pilgrimage on condition that they covered their costs in foreign currency, which the government said would not burden the national economy. With the requirement no longer in place this year, Sri Lanka is expecting to fully utilize its allocated quota of 3,500 pilgrims. This year the government of Sri Lanka has not imposed such restrictions, as (the) Sri Lankan economy has improved, Ibrahim Sahib Ansar, who oversees Hajj logistics at the Ministry of Religious Affairs, told Arab News. About 2,200 people have already registered with the Ministry of Religious Affairs as of Wednesday. We are confident that 3,500 pilgrims will go this year, Ansar said. There is more enthusiasm and interest among the people of Sri Lanka in performing Hajj this time. Muslims make up almost 10 percent of the countrys population of 22 million, which is predominantly Buddhist. Despite the countrys economy still not being sound, the Muslim minority is determined to perform the spiritual journey that is one of Islams five pillars of faith. Sri Lankan Muslims, irrespective of their financial status, they give priority to the religious obligations such as prayer, fasting and Hajj, Ansar said. The Muslims in Sri Lanka are generally very religious and pious. Many Muslims save money for some years to perform Hajj, as they regard performing Hajj as an important duty. Over 100 travel agents have been appointed by the government to streamline Sri Lankas Hajj operations this year. Rizmi Reyal, who heads the All-Ceylon Hajj Tour Operators Association, told Arab News that the enthusiasm over the pilgrimage and the number of pilgrims were a sign of normalcy returning to the country. The situation in the country is coming back to normal compared to the hardships faced last year, he said. The rupee is becoming stronger, power is back to normal, and the people are positive.

        "title": "Pakistan buys its first cargo of discounted Russian crude oil",
        "date": "April 20, 2023 04:49 pm",
        "content": "Pakistan has placed its first order for discounted Russian crude oil under a new deal struck between Islamabad and Moscow, the countrys petroleum minister said, with one cargo to dock at Karachi port in May. Pakistans purchase gives Russia a new outlet for its crude, adding to Moscows growing sales to India and China, as it redirects volumes from western markets where its oil has been banned in the wake of the Ukraine conflict. Discounted crude offers much needed respite to cash-strapped Pakistan in the face of a balance of payments crisis and critically low foreign exchange reserves. Energy imports make up the majority of the countrys external payments. The deal will see Pakistan buy only crude oil, not refined fuels, with imports expected to reach 100,000 barrels per day if the first transaction goes through smoothly, Minister Musadik Malik told Reuters on Wednesday night. Our orders are in, we have placed that already, he said, confirming source-based information that the country would only be buying crude, not refined products. Pakistan imported 154,000 barrels per day of oil in 2022, relatively flat from the previous year, data from analytics firm Kpler showed. Most of the crude was supplied by the worlds top exporter Saudi Arabia followed by the United Arab Emirates. If Russian crude supplies were to reach 100,000 barrels per day, it would mean a potentially big drop for Middle East suppliers to Pakistan. Malik declined to say whether Chinese yuan and the UAE dirham would be used as currencies for transactions, with Pakistan short of dollars. He did not comment on the rate of imports either. I will not disclose anything about the commercial side of the deal, he said. He said Pakistans Refinery Limited (PRL) PKRF.PSX will initially refine the Russian crude in a trial run, followed by Pak-Arab Refinery Limited (PARCO) and other refineries later. Russian Energy Minister Nikolay Shulginov led a delegation to Islamabad in January to hold talks on the deal, after which he said oil exports to Pakistan could begin after March. Malik took a proposal to Moscow to negotiate the deal late last year. Western nations have imposed a 60 a barrel price cap for anyone to buy Russian oil as part of sanctions against Moscow, however India and China have been paying prices above the price cap, according to traders and Reuters calculations.

        "title": "Seagate to pay 300 million penalty for shipping Huawei 7 million hard drives",
        "date": "April 20, 2023 05:30 pm",
        "content": "Seagate Technology Holdings PLC has agreed to pay a 300 million penalty in a settlement with U.S. authorities for shipping over 1.1 billion worth of hard disk drives to Chinas Huawei in violation of U.S. export control laws, the Department of Commerce said on Wednesday. Seagate sold the drives to Huawei between August 2020 and September 2021 despite an August 2020 rule that restricted sales of certain foreign items made with U.S. technology to the company. Huawei was placed on the Entity List, a U.S. trade blacklist, in 2019 to reduce the sale of U.S. goods to the company amid national security and foreign policy concerns. The penalty represents the latest in a string of actions by Washington to keep sophisticated technology from China that may support its military, enable human rights abuses or otherwise threaten U.S. security. Seagate shipped 7.4 million drives to Huawei for about a year after the 2020 rule took effect and became Huaweis sole supplier of hard drives, the Commerce Department said. The other two primary suppliers of hard drives ceased shipments to Huawei after the new rule took effect in 2020, the department said. Though they were not identified, Western Digital Corp and Toshiba Corp were the other two, the U.S. Senate Commerce Committee said in a 2021 report on Seagate. The companies did not respond to requests for comment. Even after its competitors had stopped selling to them ... Seagate continued sending hard disk drives to Huawei, Matthew Axelrod, assistant secretary for export enforcement at the Commerce Departments Bureau of Industry and Security said in a statement. Todays action is the consequence. Axelrod said the administrative penalty was the largest in the history of the agency not tied to a criminal case. Seagates position was that its foreign-made drives were not subject to U.S. export control regulations, essentially because they were not the direct product of U.S. equipment. While we believed we complied with all relevant export control laws at the time we made the hard disk drive sales at issue, we determined that ... settling this matter was the best course of action, Seagate CEO Dave Mosley said in a statement. In an order issued on Wednesday, the government said Seagate wrongly interpreted the foreign product rule to require evaluation of only the last stage of its manufacturing process rather than the entire process. Seagate made drives in China, Northern Ireland, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, and the United States, the order said, and used equipment, including testing equipment, subject to the rule. In August, the U.S. Department of Commerce sent the company a proposed charging letter, warning the company that it may have violated export control laws. The letter kicked off some eight months of negotiations. Reuters broke news of the charging letter in October. Seagates 300 million penalty is due in installments of 15 million per quarter over five years, with the first payment due in October. It also agreed to three audits of its compliance program, and is subject to a five-year suspended order denying its export privileges. The company said in light of the settlement it would report its fiscal third quarter 2023 financial results before the market opens on Thursday, rather than a previous plan for after the close of trade.

        "date": "April 20, 2023 05:38 pm",
        "content": "The Secretary to the Ministry of Agriculture, Gunadasa Samarasinghe, has confirmed Chinas request to import 100,000 toque macaque monkeys from the cash-strapped island nation amidst protests from several environmentalists against the deal. Speaking to Indian media, Samarasinghe said that a privately-owned animal breeding Chinese company, connected to zoological gardens, had made the request to his ministry. We will not send the whole 100,000 in one lot. But we considered the request due to crop damages caused by the monkeys in several parts of the country. They will not be taken from conserved areas. The focus will be only in the cultivation areas, Samarasinghe was quoted as saying by PTI. Samaraisnghes statements come at a time where several environmental organisations and animal rights groups have raised deep concerns about the Sri Lankans government decision to export the endangered species to China. The toque macaque monkey is endemic to Sri Lanka and classified as endangered on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) red list, after they were recently removed from the list of protected species on the island. Sri Lanka removed several species including all three monkey species in the country  namely tufted gray langur, purple-faced leaf monkey and toque macaque  from the protected list, taking into account the fact that monkeys have become a menace as they constantly damage the crops and forage the villages for food. This allows farmers to kill the animals which are not listed as protected. However, conservationists took issue with the decision to export toque macaques, saying that they are sceptical that these animals are planned to be used for experiments in China as toque macaques show high genetic similarity to humans. Meanwhile, the Chinese Embassy in Colombo said on Wednesday (19 April) that Chinas wildlife authorities have clarified that they are not aware of any such request to export 100,000 toque macaque monkeys from Sri Lanka to a Chinese private company, adding that no such application has been received from any side. - With input from agencies",

        "content": "The petition filed by a group of persons, claiming that the Penal Code (Amendment) Bill tabled in Parliament by MP Premnath C. Dolawatte is in violation of the Constitution of Sri Lanka, was taken up before the Supreme Court this morning (20 April). The petition was heard before a three-judge bench of the Supreme Court, comprising of Chief Justice Jayantha Jayasuriya and Justices Vijith Malalgoda and Arjun Obeysekera. Appearing on behalf of the petitioners, Attorney-at-Law Dharshana Weraduwage presented facts to the court, claiming that certain provisions of the Bill were noncompliant with the Constitution, highlighting a clause in the Bill which attempted to decriminalise homosexuality. Weraduwage emphasised that the Bill violated certain fundamental rights cited in Article 3 and 12 (1) of the Constitution, and thus requires the publics approval. Accordingly, the hearing of the Bill is scheduled to continue tomorrow (21 April). A petition was filed by Retired Army Brigadier K. Athula H. de Silva, Shenali D. Waduge and Jehan Hameed, naming MP Dolawatte and the Attorney General as the respondents, seeking an order that if the proposed Penal Code (Amendment) Bill is required to be passed, it must be approved by a two-thirds majority vote in the Parliament and also a referendum, since the provisions contained in the proposed bill violate the fundamental human rights mentioned in the Constitution. The petitioners alleged that the relevant Bill tabled as a private members Bill by MP Dolawatte attempted to interpret homosexuality as a non-criminal offence, while promoting such activities. The petition also mentions that it is contrary to the expectations of the legislature regarding the penal code and thereby seriously violates the provisions of the constitution, adding that certain provision of the Bill in question are also against religious beliefs, as homosexual activities have not been endorsed in accordance with Buddhist, Hindu, Christian or Islamic beliefs.",

        "content": "SpaceXs massive Starship has launched, but failed to make orbit. The stainless steel space vessel  composed of a space craft sitting atop the so-called Super Heavy booster rocket  took off the launch site in launch site at Boca Chica, Texas on Thursday morning. At least five of its 33 Raptor engines did not appear to fire upon liftoff, said Stephen Clark, with Spaceflightnow.com. The rocket cleared the launch tower and headed into the sky. However, the space craft failed to separate from the Super Heavy booster, with the entire vessel spinning before falling apart  in what is technically called a rapid unscheduled disassembly. The behemoth launching system was 120 metres (394 feet) tall, higher than New York Citys Statue of Liberty. Its successful takeoff represents a step forward in US space travel, with the company foreseeing the vessel as a key link in a manned mission one day reaching Mars. The liftoff sets a record for the largest rocket ever to be launched. SpaceXs owner, Elon Musk had said in March that the chances the rocket would reach orbit were about 50 percent. On Thursday, he tweeted: Congrats (SpaceX) team on an exciting launch of Starship! Learned a lot for next test launch in a few months. There was a fire at the launch site following the liftoff. As designed, the Starship rocket is nearly two times more powerful than NASAs own Space Launch System (SLS), which made its debut uncrewed flight to orbit in November. The US space agency NASA has also picked the Starship spacecraft to ferry astronauts to the Moon in late 2025  a mission known as Artemis III  for the first time since the Apollo program ended in 1972. SpaceX had previously scrubbed a launch planned for Monday, citing a pressurization issue in the lower-stage Super Heavy booster. Musk tweeted he learned a lot from the abandoned test. Prototypes of the Starship cruise vessel had made five subspace flights up to 10 km (6 miles) above Earth in recent years. The Super Heavy booster had never left the ground, although SpaceX did conduct a test-firing of the booster, igniting 31 of its 33 Raptor engines for roughly 10 seconds with the rocket bolted in place vertically atop a platform in February. Its a very risky flight, Musk said in a Twitter live on Sunday. Its the first launch of a very complicated, gigantic rocket. In a successful test, all 33 Raptor engines would ignite simultaneously to loft the Starship on a flight that nearly completes a full orbit of the Earth before it re-enters the atmosphere and free-falls into the Pacific at supersonic speed about 60 miles (97 km) off the coast of the northern Hawaiian islands.

Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed, has offered to assist Sri Lanka in various fields, including the development of the islands energy and tourism sectors. The matter was discussed during a recent meeting between the Minister and the Ambassador of Sri Lanka to the UAE, Udaya Indrarathna at the ministry premises. The discussion mainly focused on avenues to further enhance the friendly relations between Sri Lanka and UAE in order to reach new heights of bilateral cooperation between the two nations. During the discussion, Ambassador Indrarathna extended greetings from President Ranil Wickremeisnghe, and briefed the Minister about the steady development of Sri Lanka under Wickremesinghes leadership.

        "title": "Proposal on lubricant levy an attempt to paralyse PUCSLs independence  Chairman",
        "date": "April 20, 2023 10:29 pm",
        "content": "The Chairman of the Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL) Janaka Ratnayake has accused the Ministry of Power and Energy of attempting to paralyse the independency of the commission by way of its proposal to remove the lubricant levy from the PUCSL. Issuing a statement in this regard, the PUCSL chairman noted that the Ministry has proposed to remove the lubricant levy from the PUCSL, the shadow regulator of lubricant market without providing a proper justification, but to parallelize the independency of the Commission. He said the PUCSL has been regulating the lubricant market for 17 years from year 2006. Commenting on the matter, Ratnayake raised concerns that removing the lubricant levy from PUCSL could have serious negative consequences, potentially putting the safety and well-being of consumers at risk. He noted that it is important for regulators to have the required funds and resourced to carry out their respective functions effectively, so as to ensure that their products are safe and reliable. As the PUCSL is funded through a levy to regulate the lubricant market and when the levy is removed, it could lead to the regulator being unable to fulfill its functions effectively and to be dependent on the state funds and political influence. Without independent funds, the regulator may not be able to carry out its mandate of ensuring sustainability within the lubricant industry. This could result in several dangers, including domination of substandard and unauthorized lubricant products in the market, leading to vehicle and manufacturing equipment failures, accidents, and other negative outcomes. Adulteration of lubricant has become a major concern of the lubricant market and PUCSL have made impressive progress in eradicating such substandard and unauthorized lubricant products, paving the pathway for better qualified lubricant products, which will ultimately benefit the consumers, Rathnayake said in this regard. Thus, the PUCSL Chairman stated that paralysing an independent regulator such as PUCSL for political gains would not only affect the existing market, but would also adversely affect the future of the lubricant market, adding that cutting off the wings of an independent utility would also give out the wrong message to the international community.",

        "date": "April 20, 2023 10:30 pm",
        "content": "The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) Sri Lanka Energy Programme and Sling Mobility (Pvt.) Ltd. have signed a grant agreement to develop and operate two battery swapping stations for electric bikes (E-bikes). The agreement was signed on18 April, with the grant being the first of its kind for the programme. Accordingly, it will fund the construction of the stations, also known as battery switching stations, in Colombo. The stations allow E-vehicle owners to quickly exchange empty batteries for fully charged ones and avoid the waiting time for charging. The project also will recruit 20 new riders to pilot the deployment of E-bikes for delivery services in a timely, cost-saving, and environmentally safer manner. This one grant activity, within a larger group of grants, will assist in catalyzing the development of EV charging stations in the country. The United States and the American people are proud of our enduring and robust 75-year partnership with the people of Sri Lanka, said USAID Mission Director Gabriel Grau. We remain fully committed to support locally led initiatives to advance E-technologies that are critical to promote the progress of a nation in an environmentally friendly and cost-effective way. Sling Mobility is a technology solutions company focused on electric vehicles, and its demand driven approach is key to future of EVs in Sri Lanka and beyond, said Love Yadav, general partner for Sling Mobility. Its business model is stitched around improving EV affordability and faster adoption, reducing rider downtime, and building a platform for sustainable charging. The USAID grant is an important validation for Sling Mobilitys operating model, and we are extremely happy to be a part of this journey. The results of the pilot program will show the energy project and Sling Mobility the feasibility of promoting E-battery swapping stations in the country. The USAID Sri Lanka Energy Program is one component of the United States long-standing partnership with the Sri Lankan people to promote a healthy, educated, and employed population. The program supports transforming Sri Lankas power sector into a market-based, secure, reliable, and sustainable system by mobilizing investment to deploy advanced technologies, increase flexibility, and enhance competitiveness.",

        "content": "The Catholic Church in Sri Lanka has decided to form a human chain (Jana Pavura) as today (April 21) marks the fourth commemoration of the ghastly bombings on Easter Sunday 2019 which claimed the lives of hundreds and left a long-lasting void in the families and friends of terror attack victims. The human chain is organized in support of the Catholic Churchs quest to seek the long overdue truth behind the brutal carnage on April 21, 2019, and justice for the victims. The Archbishop of Colombo, His Eminence Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith has invited all Sri Lankans to join the campaign today. The human chain, themed We are Watching until Justice is Meted Out, was initiated at 8.00 a.m. this morning and it will be formed from St. Anthonys Church in Kochchikade to St. Sebastians Church in Katuwapitiya on the Colombo-Negombo main road. Meanwhile, a march was organized from St. Sebastians Church in Katuwapitiya to St. Anthonys Church in Kochchikade last night and a special church service was also held in parallel with the march. A special commemoration event and a Mass, led by Cardinal Ranjith and Apostolic Nuncio Archbishop Biran Udaigwe, will be held at the St. Anthonys Church in Kochchikade from 8.00 a.m. It is be attended by the ambassadors and high commissioners of several countries including China, the United States and the United Kingdom. A two-minute silence will also be observed at 8.45 a.m. in memory of the victims of the brutal terror attack. The country was left devastated on April 21, 2019 after a group of suicide attackers of the now-outlawed local Islamic extremist organization National Thowheed Jamaat (NTJ) carried out a series of coordinated bomb blasts at St. Anthonys Church in Kochchikade, St. Sebastians Church in Katuwapitiya, Zion Church in Batticaloa, Cinnamon Grand, Kingsbury and Shangri-La hotels in Colombo and a guest house in Dehiwala, leaving more than 260 people including foreigners dead and at least 500 people injured. Sri Lanka declared a state of emergency immediately after the bombings and the probes launched into the incident led to the arrest of many who have had links to the suicide bombers. The Sri Lankan Catholic Church led by Cardinal Ranjith and the families of the victims have continuously raised concerns and doubts about slow progress of the investigations into the attacks, accusing the government of sweeping the truth under the rug for political gains.",

        "date": "April 21, 2023 09:12 am",
        "content": "Sri Lanka Navy says 23 individuals, who were among the 303 Sri Lankan nationals rescued after a boat capsized off the coast of Vietnam in November 2022, were deported to the island earlier this week. A total of 151 were deported from Vietnam soon after being rescued and they arrived at Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) in Katunayake on December 28, 2022. In the same vein, 23 more Sri Lankans who were deported from Vietnam arrived in Katunayake on April 19. A Vietnamese-flagged fishing vessel (Lady R3) carrying 303 Sri Lankan nationals was reported to be in distress in Vietnam seas on November 07, 2022. The Maritime Rescue Coordination Centre (MRCC) in Colombo stationed at the Sri Lanka Navy Headquarters promptly coordinated the rescue of this group of people whom were temporarily settled in Vietnam upon rescuing. The Navy Headquarters on the morning of November 07, 2022 received the distress signal about the ill-fated Vietnamese-flagged fishing vessel. Responding promptly to the development, MRCC Colombo informed MRCC Singapore, MRCC Vietnam and MRCC Philippine for the rescue of people in distress at sea, within the control of those MRCCs. Accordingly, MRCC Singapore and Vietnam in a coordinated search and rescue operation managed to rescue the group of Sri Lankans by deploying MV HELIOS LEADER. Upon being rescued they were taken away to Vietnam by an SAR vessel on November 09 and temporarily settled there. It was revealed that the group of Sri Lankans who faced this unfortunate turn of events in Vietnam seas had flown to Myanmar form Sri Lanka legally and was on an illegal migration attempt from there, with the help of international human smugglers. Among the group deported on April 19 were fifteen males and six females who are aged between 19 and 50 years and two individuals below 18 years. They have been identified as residents of Jaffna, Kilinochchi, Vavuniya, Trincomalee and Batticaloa. Relevant authorities including the Department of Immigration and Emigration are carrying out the legal proceedings into the incident.",

        "date": "April 21, 2023 09:48 am",
        "content": "UNFPA Sri Lanka plans to implement a new project ENSURE: Ensuring access to life-saving sexual  reproductive health and providing gender-based violence prevention and response services for women, girls and vulnerable groups with funding from the Government of Japan. This USD 4.6 million-worth project and will provide mobile clinic service and essential commodities such as hygiene kits to women, girls and vulnerable groups affected by the current crisis in Sri Lanka, the Embassy of Japan in Colombo said in a statement. In order to implement the project, UNFPA and the Government of Japan in Sri Lanka will work closely with the Ministry of Health, Ministry of Women and Child Affairs and Social Empowerment and partners from government and non-governmental organizations to save 3 million women, girls and youth in seven districts in five provinces including Northern, Eastern and Central Provinces. The targeted districts were identified by using the district-level poverty rate, incident rate of violence by an intimate partner and the project aims to protect those severely affected by the breakdown of the economy and protracted socio-economic crisis. Ambassador of Japan to Sri Lanka, Mizukoshi Hideaki stressed the importance of protecting women and girls, especially in vulnerable communities in the rural areas where the access to health service has been a challenge for the local people due to the price hike and income reduction. Ambassador Mizukoshi also reiterated Japans strong commitment to continue the support for womens health and protection of women and girls as a sincere friend of Sri Lanka. In 2022, the Humanitarian Needs and Priorities (HNP) Plan 2022 estimated that 5.7 million people in Sri Lanka are in need of immediate humanitarian assistance, with over 4.9 million being food insecure. Prices of menstrual health products skyrocketed from March with tax hikes. With a sanitary pad packet of 10 costing over Rs. 300, women are forced to sacrifice their hygiene for buying a kilo or two of rice to feed their family instead. The increasing cost of medical care and shortage of essential medicines are depriving women and girls of urgent and lifesaving basic and comprehensive medical care. Commenting on the project, UNFPA Representative in Sri Lanka, Kunle Adeniyi noted that, It is vital we identify and ensure women and girls to attain their full potential. With the ENSURE initiative, UNFPA and the Government of Japan are dedicated to ensuring that women, young people, and persons with disabilities have continuous access to life-saving sexual and reproductive health services. We are also dedicated to strengthening health and protection systems at the district and divisional levels by supporting shelter services and providing vital medicines and commodities to address gender-based violence and ensure women deliver safely. I look forward to working together with all of our partners as we start this endeavor.",
