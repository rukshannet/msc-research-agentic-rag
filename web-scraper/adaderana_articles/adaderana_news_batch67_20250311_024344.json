        "content": "The Special Investigations Unit (SIU) of the Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment (SLBFE) recently arrested two persons for attempting to send six women to Dubai for employment, on tourist visas. Accordingly, the two suspects, identified as residents of Welegoda in Matara and Ashokapura in Mihintale, were arrested and produced before the Negombo Magistrates Court on 11 November, after which they were remanded until 14 November. On 11 November, a group of six women had attempted to leave for Dubai on tourist visas, albeit they were travelling for employment prospects. The Safe Migration Promotion Unit (SMPU) stationed at the Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) in Katunayake, however, upon a suspicion, had questioned the group in question. The women were then turned away from the airport, while the SLBFE also temporarily blacklisted all six passports, preventing the group from travelling abroad until the suspension is lifted.",

        "date": "November 14, 2023 03:16 pm",
        "content": "A new judge bench of the Appeals Court has been appointed for the consideration of the motion filed by Sports Minister Roshan Ranasinghe challenging the stay order on the recently-formed Interim Committee for Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC). According to Ada Derana correspondent, Justices D.N. Samarakoon and Neil Iddawela will sit for the consideration of the motion hereafter. The motion has been fixed for consideration again on November 16. Earlier today (Nov.14), the Appeals Court President, Justice Nissanka Bandula Karunaratne recused himself from the consideration of the motion filed by Minister Ranasinghe, seeking an order revoking the aforementioned stay order. Citing the criticisms levelled at him since of late, by not only the minister, but also other Cabinet Ministers and Members of Parliament, the Appeals Court president said he would excuse himself from the legal proceedings in respect of the motion. The motion was called before a two-judge bench comprising Justice Karunaratne himself and Justice Vikum Kaluarachchi this morning. After the Appeals Court presidents recusal, the consideration of the motion was handed over to Justices Sobhitha Rajakaruna and Dhammika Ganepola. However, the latter also recused himself. On that account, a new judge bench was appointed for the legal proceedings pertaining to the motion. Sports Minister Roshan Ranasinghe on Monday (13 Nov.) filed a motion requesting the lifting of the stay order issued by the Court of Appeal preventing the operation of the 7-member Interim Committee appointed by him for the SLC and the relevant gazette notification published in this regard. The motion including the objections related to the relevant stay order, has been filed before the Appeals Court through Attorney-at-Law G.G. Arulpragasam. On November 07, the Appeals Court issued 14-day stay orders preventing the operation of the seven-member Interim Committee appointed for the Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) and the relevant gazette notification issued by Sports Minister Roshan Ranasinghe in this regard, after considering a writ petition filed by the Chairman of SLC Shammi Silva. Accordingly, three stay orders were issued pertaining to the matter: the first to prevent the gazette issued by the Sports Minister appointing the interim committee for the SLC, the second to prevent the committee members chaired by Arjuna Ranatunga from acting in their respective positions and the third to prevent the respondents including the Sports Minister from interfering the activities of the petitioner and the other officials of cricket board. Sports Minister Roshan Ranasinghe appointed a seven-member Interim Committee for Sri Lanka Cricket, chaired by World Cup-winning former Sri Lanka captain Arjuna Ranatunga on November 06, 2023, under the authority granted to him by the Sports Law No 25 of 1973, while the previous board was also suspended.",

        "title": "Hamas ready to free up to 70 hostages in exchange for a five-day truce",
        "date": "November 14, 2023 03:48 pm",
        "content": "Israeli forces bombarded southern Gaza on Tuesday after tanks advanced to the gates of the enclaves biggest hospital in the north where health officials say dozens of patients, including babies, have died due to a lack of power and the heavy fighting. At least 13 people were killed when Israeli forces targeted their homes in the southern city of Khan Younis, Gaza health ministry officials said. The military has also positioned tanks outside Al Shifa Hospital, Gaza Citys main medical centre, which Israel says sits atop tunnels housing a headquarters for Hamas fighters who are using patients as shields. Hamas denies the Israeli claim. The Israeli military said it was coordinating the transfer of incubators into Gaza, in a possible measure to enable the evacuation of newborn babies from the hospital. Gaza health ministry spokesperson Ashraf Al-Qidra, who was inside Al Shifa hospital, said on Monday 32 patients had died in the previous three days, including three newborns. At least 650 patients remain inside, he added. In his first comments since the patient deaths reported at Al Shifa, U.S. President Joe Biden said hospitals must be protected. My hope and expectation is that there will be less intrusive action relative to hospitals and we remain in contact with the Israelis, Biden told reporters on Monday. Also there is an effort to get this pause to deal with the release of prisoners and thats being negotiated, as well, with the Qataris ... being engaged, he added. So I remain somewhat hopeful but hospitals must be protected. On Monday, Israels military released video and photos of what it said were weapons the group stored in the basement of Rantissi hospital, a paediatric hospital specializing in cancer treatment. In a statement on its Telegram channel, Hamas said the video showed fabricated scenes that misled public opinion, adding that it was a failed attempt by Israel to justify the targeting of hospitals. Hostages for ceasefire? Israel launched its war against Hamas after the Islamist Palestinian groups Oct. 7 rampage into southern Israel. Around 1,200 people died in that attack and 240 were dragged to Gaza as hostages according to Israels tally. The armed wing of Hamas said it was ready to free up to 70 women and children held in Gaza in exchange for a five-day truce in the war. Gaza medical authorities say more than 11,000 people have been confirmed killed in Israeli bombardment, about 40 of them children. Roughly two-thirds of the people in the densely populated Mediterranean strip have been made homeless by Israels military campaign, in which it has ordered the northern half of Gaza evacuated. Al-Qassam Brigades, the armed wing of Hamas, posted an audio recording on Telegram saying the group was ready to release as many as 70 women and children hostages in return for a five-day ceasefire, an offer Israel is unlikely to embrace. We told the (Qatari) mediators that in a five-day truce, we can release 50 of them and the number could reach 70 due to the difficulty that the captives are held by different factions, said al-Qassam Brigades spokesman Abu Ubaida said, saying Israel had asked for 100 to be freed. Israel, which effectively blockades Gaza, has rejected a ceasefire, arguing that Hamas would simply use it to regroup, but has permitted brief humanitarian pauses to allow food and other supplies to flow in and foreigners to flee. White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters Washington would like to see considerably longer pauses - days, not hours - in the context of a hostage release. A Washington Post opinion writer on Tuesday quoted an unnamed high-ranking Israeli official as saying Israel and Hamas are close to a deal to free most of the kidnapped Israeli women and children with Israel simultaneously releasing Palestinian women and youths held in its prisons. An agreement could be announced within days if the details are worked out. West Bank violence In the occupied West Bank, at least six Palestinians were killed by Israeli forces, the Palestinian health ministry and Palestinian media said. At least three of those were killed in an Israeli drone strike, the Palestinians official news agency WAFA reported, citing a hospital in the western city of Tulkarm. The Israeli army and police said their forces, sent into Tulkarm to detain suspected militants, came under fire and killed several Palestinian gunmen in the ensuing skirmish. Israeli troops also shot dead at least two Palestinians during earlier clashes in a refugee camp in the city, WAFA reported. The worsening violence in the West Bank comes after more than 18 months of bloodshed that has fuelled fears the West Bank could erupt into a bigger conflict and become a new front.

        "title": "Gotabaya, Mahinda, Basil  others responsible for economic crisis - SC rules",
        "date": "November 14, 2023 04:08 pm",
        "content": "In a landmark judgment, the Supreme Court today (Nov.14) ruled that former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa, former Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa and former Finance Minister Basil Rajapaksa and several others are responsible for the economic crisis that Sri Lanka was grappling with. On that account, the countrys highest courts judge bench determined that the three Rajapaksa brothers as well as former Central Bank governors Ajith Nivard Cabraal and Prof. W.D. Lakshman, former Finance Secretary S.R. Attygalle, former Presidential Secretary P.B. Jayasundara and the Monetary Board members of the Central Bank have violated the public trust and breached Article 12 (1) of the Constitution, in their administration of the economy, leading to the economic crisis in the country. The ruling was delivered based on the majority view of the five-judge bench in respect of two fundamental rights (FR) petitions filed in this respect. The case was heard before Chief Justice Jayantha Jayasuriya, PC; Buwaneka Aluwihare, PC; Priyantha Jayawardena, PC; Vijith Malalgoda, PC; and Murdu Fernando, PC. The decision was a 4-1 split, with Justice Priyantha Jayawardena, PC dissenting, the TISL mentioned in a statement. The TISL said the judges have made some key observations in their judgment:  The conduct of Respondents directly contributed to the results that led to the crisis situation.  Respondents ought to have known and should have taken actions to resolve matters that negatively impacted the economy and not further aggravate the impact and are responsible for acting in the best interest of the country.  Public officers have a responsibility to discharge their duties in the best interest of the public.  Respondents are bestowed high power to uphold public trust and are duty-bound to discharge duties according to Directives of the Constitution. Respondents cannot shirk responsibility by merely stating that the decisions they took were policy decisions.  It was within the full power of Respondents to prevent such calamity as they had full knowledge.  It is clear that they did not act and take all measures to remedy the situation in the public interest.  Cumulative actions and inactions by Respondents led to the debacle. The public trust reposed in Respondents was not a higher one and is bestowed on all officers, and therefore Respondents were obliged to act in a responsible manner.  Actions, omissions and conduct of Respondents contributed to the economic crisis. The former head of the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce Chandra Jayaratne, Transparency International Sri Lanka (TISL), Jehan CanagaRetna and Julian Bolling had put forward one petition on June 17, 2022, calling for action against persons responsible for the economic crisis in Sri Lanka. The TISL said the petition was filed in the public interest, considering the lack of accountability and transparency in high level decision-making that has brought Sri Lanka to its knees. On the request of respondents, the Supreme Court took up the petition along with another petition which was similar in nature. Given that petitioners had come to courts in the interest of the public and did not seek compensation for themselves, the judge bench was not inclined to order compensation other than costs incurred by petitioners.",

        "content": "The Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) alleges that the government has not presented any of the proposals which were previously discussed and agreed with their union, through the 2024 Budget. Joining a press briefing held this morning (14), Secretary of the GMOA Dr. Haritha Aluthge highlighted that they are paying special attention to what the governments policy is with regard to doctors. One thing that can be seen in this budget is that there is a huge gap between what the government promised us and what was read out. There is no proper explanation even from the authorities regarding that gap. What we asked the government was to provide economic justice for the doctors. At first glance, we do not see that a solution has been presented through the budget to get the required amount of stimulation for that purpose, Dr. Aluthge emphasized. We look forward to an explanation from the authorities regarding this during the next few days. We hope to be patient and wait for the response from the authorities within these two or three days. He mentioned that following the consideration of the governments response, the Central Committee of the GMOA will meet and decide on their future actions. Against this backdrop, the Chief Secretary of the All Ceylon Nurses Association S.B. Mediwatta, also speaking to reporters, demanded that the salary increment of all health sector employees needs to come into effect from 01 January 2024.",

The relevant report was handed over to the Speaker by the chairman of the committee, Deputy Speaker Ajith Rajapakse today (Nov. 14). The committee appointed by the Speaker to probe the incident also includes MPs Chamal Rajapakse, Ramesh Pathirana, Gayantha Karunathilake, Imthiaz Bakeer Markar, Thalatha Athukorala and Seetha Arambepola. During the parliamentary session on October 20, Gamage had accused Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) MP Sujith Sanjaya Perera of assaulting her outside the Chamber and called for a comprehensive investigation into the matter. This had prompted the temporary adjournment of the session by Deputy Speaker Ajith Rajapakse, at the request of Prime Minister Dinesh Gunawardena. After the session resumed, Chief Opposition Whip SJB MP Lakshman Kiriella said the opposition MPs had met up with Speaker Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena and showed him video footage of Diana Gamage using foul language at an opposition MP and behaving in an unruly manner. Defending his actions, MP Sujith Perera has said that he had witnessed Diana Gamage becoming embroiled in a heated argument with his fellow MP Rohana Bandara, and when he had attempted to intervene, the state minister had attacked him. The SJB parliamentarian said he only acted in self-defence. MP Perera also urged the Deputy Speaker to conduct an impartial investigation into the matter. Meanwhile, MP Rohana Bandara has accused the State Minister of following him and verbally abusing him near the elevator. Following the conclusion of the parliamentary session, the three parliamentarians were once again involved in a heated argument, which was captured by MP Perera on his mobile phone. In the aftermath of the aforesaid unruly events which unfolded in Parliament, the Cabinet of Ministers on Oct. 23 gave the nod to establish an independent body to oversee the conduct of lawmakers. Prime Minister Dinesh Gunawardena and Minister of Justice, Prison Affairs and Constitutional Reforms Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe had tabled a joint proposal in this regard.",

        "date": "November 14, 2023 06:54 pm",
        "content": "Chinas biggest lender, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, paid a ransom after it was hacked last week, a Lockbit ransomware gang representative said on Monday in a statement which Reuters was unable to independently verify. ICBC, whose U.S. arm was hit by a ransomware attack that disrupted trades in the U.S. Treasury market on Nov. 9, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. They paid a ransom, deal closed, the Lockbit representative told Reuters via Tox, an online messaging app. The blackout at ICBCs U.S. broker-dealer left it temporarily owing BNY Mellon BK.N 9 billion, an amount many times larger than its net capital. The hack was so extensive that even corporate email at the firm ceased to function, forcing employees to switch to Google mail, Reuters reported. The market is mostly back to normal now, said Zhiwei Ren, a portfolio manager at Penn Mutual Asset Management. The ransomware attack came at a time of heightened worries about the resiliency of the 26 trillion Treasury market, essential to the plumbing of global finance, and is likely to draw scrutiny from regulators. A spokesperson for the U.S. Treasury Department did not immediately provide comment on Monday. The Financial Services Information Sharing and Analysis Center, a financial industry cybersecurity group, said financial firms have well-established protocols for sharing information on such incidents. We are reminding members to stay current on all protective measures and patch critical vulnerabilities immediately, a spokesperson said in a statement, adding: Ransomware remains one of the top threat vectors facing the financial sector. WHY PAY? Lockbit has hacked some of the worlds largest organisations in recent months, stealing and leaking sensitive data in cases where victims refused to pay ransom. In just three years, it has become the worlds top ransomware threat, according to U.S. officials. Nowhere has it been more disruptive than in the United States, hitting more than 1,700 American organisations in nearly every sector from financial services and food to schools, transportation and government departments. Authorities have long advised against paying ransomware gangs in a bid to break the criminals business model. Ransom is usually demanded in the form of cryptocurrency, which is harder to trace and gives the receiver anonymity. Some companies have quietly paid up in a bid to get back online quickly and avoid the reputational damage of having their sensitive data publicly leaked. Victims who do not have digital backups that allow them to restore their systems without the need of a decryption key sometimes have no choice but to pay. Last week, Lockbit hackers published internal data from aerospace giant Boeing BA.N and said on their website they had infected computer systems at law firm Allen  Overy. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

Issuing an advisory in this regard, the Department explained that a low-pressure area had formed over Southeast Bay of Bengal adjoining Andaman and Nicobar Island this morning (14), and is likely to move west-northwest wards and intensify into a depression over west Central Bay of Bengal over the next 24hours. Accordingly, the department warned that wind speeds will be 40-45 kmph and can increase up to 50-55 kmph in sea areas between (10N - 15 N) and between (85E  91E), while heavy showers or thundershowers and rough or very rough seas can also be expected in the aforementioned sea areas. Thus, naval and fishing communities have been advised not to venture into the sea areas bounded by (10N - 15 N) and between (85E  91E) during the next 24 hours, while boats that are already out at the aforementioned sea regions have been advised to return to coasts or move to safer areas immediately.

Addressing the 10 newly appointed Sri Lankan envoys at the Temple Trees on Monday (Nov.13), Gunawardena urged them to showcase Sri Lankas ability to interact with the rest of the world, take new initiatives to attract investments and joint ventures. Our focus is to increase trade and investments. While engaging with host governments and premier business houses, leading investors and chambers of commerce and industry, you have to promote Sri Lanka as an attractive destination, not merely as a tourist destination but mainly as a place suitable for investment and trade. Sri Lanka can rapidly grow its own economy by closely engaging with other nations. It is also a pragmatic response to the shift in the world economy towards Asia, particularly the economic rise of China, India, and ASEAN, he said. The Prime Minister advised new envoys to interact with Sri Lankan expatriate organizations in host countries and important friends of Sri Lanka in those countries to build new network to promote bilateral ties. He stressed the need for strengthening ties with the Spanish speaking world, especially Latin American countries through accredited ambassadors of those countries. The newly appointed Heads of Mission are Admiral Ravindra Wijegunaratne (Pakistan), Air Marshal Sudharshan Pathirana (Nepal), former Foreign Secretary Kshenuka Senewiratne (India), Admiral Nishantha Ulugetenne (Cuba), Satyajit Rodrigo (Italy), Madurika Weninger (Egypt), Dharamapala Weerakkody (Bangladesh), Senerath Dissanayake (Singapore) and Chandana Weerasena (Belgium and the European Union).

        "title": "Israel raids Gazas Al Shifa Hospital, urges Hamas to surrender",
        "date": "November 15, 2023 07:52 am",
        "content": "(Reuters) - The Israeli military said it was carrying out a raid on Wednesday against Palestinian Hamas militants in Al Shifa Hospital, the Gaza Strips biggest hospital, and urged them all to surrender. Less than an hour earlier, around 1 a.m. local time (2300 GMT), a Gaza health ministry spokesman said Israel had told officials in the enclave that it would raid the Shifa hospital complex in the coming minutes. Dr. Munir al-Bursh, director-general of the Gaza health ministry, told Al Jazeera television that Israeli forces had raided the western side of the medical complex. There are big explosions and dust entered the areas where we are. We believe an explosion occurred inside the hospital, Bursh said. The fate of Al Shifa has become a focus of international alarm because of worsening conditions in the facility in recent days with global calls for a humanitarian ceasefire after five weeks of an Israeli assault on Gaza. In a statement, the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) said: Based on intelligence information and an operational necessity, IDF forces are carrying out a precise and targeted operation against Hamas in a specified area in the Shifa hospital. The military added: The IDF forces include medical teams and Arabic speakers, who have undergone specified training to prepare for this complex and sensitive environment, with the intent that no harm is caused to the civilians. Israel has said that Hamas has a command centre underneath Al Shifa and uses the hospital and tunnels beneath it to conceal military operations and to hold hostages. Hamas denies it. Israeli army spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Peter Lerner told CNN the hospital and compound were for Hamas a central hub of their operations, perhaps even the beating heart and maybe even a centre of gravity. The U.S. said on Tuesday that its own intelligence supported Israels conclusions. Hamas said on Wednesday that U.S. announcement had effectively given a green light for Israel to raid the hospital. The group said it held Israel and U.S. President Joe Biden fully responsible for the operation. Israeli forces have waged fierce street battles against Hamas fighters over the past 10 days before advancing into the centre of Gaza City and surrounding Al Shifa. Israel has sworn to destroy Hamas in retaliation for the militants cross-border assault into Israel on Oct 7. Israel says Hamas killed 1,200 people in the rampage and took more than 240 hostage. In the West Bank, a separate Palestinian enclave not controlled by Hamas, Palestinian Authority Health Minister Mai Alkaila said Israel was committing a new crime against humanity, medical staff and patients by besieging Al Shifa. We hold the occupation forces fully responsible for the lives of the medical staff, patients and displaced people in Al Shifa, Alkaila said in a statement. DIRE CONDITIONS Hamas says 650 patients and 5,000 to 7,000 other civilians are trapped inside the hospital grounds, under constant fire from Israeli snipers and drones. Amid shortages of fuel, water and supplies, it says 40 patients have died in recent days. Thirty-six babies are left from the neo-natal ward after three died. Without fuel for generators to power incubators, the babies were being kept as warm as possible, lined up eight to a bed. Palestinians trapped in the hospital dug a mass grave on Tuesday to bury patients who died and no plan was in place to evacuate babies despite Israel announcing an offer to send portable incubators, Ashraf Al-Qidra, Gazas health ministry spokesman, said. Qidra said there were about 100 bodies decomposing inside and no way to get them out. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres was deeply disturbed by the dramatic loss of life in the hospitals, his spokesman said. In the name of humanity, the secretary-general calls for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire, the spokesman told reporters. Medical officials in Hamas-run Gaza say more than 11,000 people are confirmed dead from Israeli strikes, around 40 of them children, and countless others trapped under rubble. Around two-thirds of Gazas 2.3 million people have been made homeless, unable to escape the territory where food, fuel, fresh water and medical supplies are running out. INTERNATIONAL LAW Israels move toward Shifa hospital has raised questions about how it would interpret international laws on protection of medical facilities and the thousands of displaced people sheltering there, U.N. human rights officials have said. Hospitals are protected buildings under international humanitarian law. But allegations that Shifa is also being used for military purposes complicated the situation because that would also breach international law, U.N. officials have said. Medical units used for acts harmful to the enemy, and which have ignored a warning to stop doing so, lose their special protection under international law. Omar Shakir, Israel and Palestine director for Human Rights Watch, said before Israels raid that even if Hamas was proven to be using hospitals to conduct military operations, international law required that effective warnings be given before attacks. This meant people there needed a safe place to go and a safe way to get there, Shakir said. Its very alarming because you have to remember hospitals in Gaza are housing tens of thousands of displaced persons. Israel said in its statement on Wednesday that it had given Gaza authorities 12 hours to cease military activities within the hospital. Unfortunately, it did not, the military statement said. International Criminal Court prosecutor Karim Khan said in an Oct. 30 statement on attacks on protected sites such as hospitals that Israel would also need to demonstrate the proper application of the principles of distinction, precaution and of proportionality. Although protection under international law could be lost, he said, the burden of proving that the protective status is lost rests with those who fire the gun, the missile or the rocket in question.

        "title": "Economic growth of 1.8 expected in 2024 - Finance State Minister",
        "date": "November 15, 2023 08:57 am",
        "content": "State Minister of Finance, Shehan Semasinghe says the anticipated economic growth for the year 2024 is projected at 1.8. Addressing a press briefing at the Presidential Media Centre (PMC) on Tuesday (Nov.14), the lawmaker has underscored the governments commitment to fostering a robust economy during this period. A particular emphasis will be placed on the advancement of small and medium enterprises as part of this overarching objective, he said further. The state minister further highlighted that the recently announced budget for the upcoming year places particular emphasis on addressing the needs of government employees, and impoverished and economically vulnerable families. Additionally, a special focus has been directed towards uplifting small and medium enterprises. Semasinghe also provided insights during the discussion, noting that the budget unveiled for the fiscal year 2023, following President Ranil Wickremesinghes appointment as the Minister of Finance, stands as one of the most formidable budgets in the nations history: Faced with the daunting backdrop of a severe economic recession prevailing up to 2022, the circumstances for presenting a budget in 2023 were notably challenging. Nevertheless, under the leadership of President Ranil Wickremesinghe, the government rose to the occasion and accepted this formidable challenge. Building upon the stability achieved, the Government is now successfully implementing the government program for the year 2024, propelling towards the envisioned economic objectives. Had the government chosen to adopt a populist approach similar to the opposition during that period, the current state of the country might not have reached its present condition. Despite facing persistent accusations from the opposition, especially concerning the 2023 budget, the government remains resolute in its commitment to effective governance and fiscal responsibility. Presently, the governments focus lies on meeting the primary requisites of state revenue amounting to Rs. 4,127 billion, managing state expenditures totalling Rs. 6,978 billion, and addressing a budget deficit of Rs. 2,851 billion. Aligned with the objectives outlined in this years budget, the government is diligently pursuing key targets as elucidated in the domestic debt optimization program. The 2024 budget is crafted with a strategic focus on alleviating the debt burden, aiming to reduce it from 128 to 95. Concurrently, efforts are directed towards diminishing the financial requirement from 34.6 to 13 and curtailing foreign debt servicing from the current 9.4 to 4.5. In response to the prevailing economic challenges, the governments approach involves providing essential stimulus to reinvigorate the economy. This involves targeted measures in areas that have garnered attention and commentary from various stakeholders over the past few months. The commitment lies in addressing the economic crisis by proactively responding to identified concerns and fostering sustainable economic recovery. An integral focus to the priorities has been the domestic debt optimization, recognizing its pivotal role in achieving sustainable credit practices. The successful conclusion of the domestic debt optimization program has laid the groundwork for the on-going efforts in bilateral foreign debt restructuring. As we navigate this process, we hold the expectation that these strategic initiatives will pave the way for securing the second instalment from the International Monetary Fund (IMF). In formulating this years budget, a particular emphasis was placed on addressing the needs of government employees, impoverished and economically vulnerable families, and small to medium-scale entrepreneurs. Despite the potential for engaging in populist measures, such as raising government employee salaries from January, the government pursued a correct course of action. The decision was made with the foresight and responsibility to prevent undue economic pressure on the country. These initiatives were executed under the direct guidance of the President, demonstrating a commitment to prudent economic management and sustainable policies. In the current years budget, a dedicated focus was directed towards supporting small and medium enterprises (SMEs), which constitute over 50 of the countrys economy. A substantial allocation of Rs. 30 billion has been earmarked for their rehabilitation, divided into two segments. A facilitating institution, responsible for issuing guarantees, is set to be established in January under the Ministry of Finance. An estimated expenditure of Rs. 50 million is allocated for this purpose, alongside an additional Rs. 50 million designated for providing financial facilities at subsidized interest rates. It is the aspiration to further reduce this subsidized interest rate to a single-digit figure, reinforcing the commitment to bolstering the SME sector and fostering economic resilience. Furthermore, this years budget, particular emphasis has been placed on pivotal initiatives, including granting land rights to the public, facilitating the acquisition of freehold deeds for ownership and implementing substantial educational reforms. These measures underscore the commitment to fostering economic strength and resilience in the year 2024. The overarching objective is to propel the nation towards robust economic growth, with a targeted rate of 1.8. These strategic endeavours align with the vision to create a foundation for sustained economic prosperity and societal development. The President has astutely identified and addressed the pressing issues faced by the public. Despite opposition to the budget, presented at a time of significant risk to life, it is noteworthy that the stability observed in the country today is a direct result of the last budgets impact. The absence of the unity observed among the members of parliament, who had recently come together for cricket, in addressing the economic needs of the countrys 22 million people is a matter of profound disappointment. This situation is indeed disheartening, and it raises questions about the priorities and collective responsibility of those in leadership roles. In light of these circumstances, there is a valid argument to be made that the leader of the opposition may lack the moral authority to question the budget. The imperative to swiftly expand government revenue, particularly through the enhancement of the income tax collection network, is crucial for the economic stability of Sri Lanka. The program outlined by the President in this regard, if effectively implemented, holds the promise of averting a recurrence of economic crises. A robust and efficient revenue collection system is fundamental to sustaining fiscal health and fostering long-term economic resilience. The success of this initiative would contribute significantly to securing a stable economic trajectory for the nation.",

        "content": "Bangladesh is currently experiencing its most severe outbreak of dengue fever on record, and experts are pointing to climate change as a contributing factor. They say rising temperatures and an extended monsoon season are creating optimal conditions for the Aedes mosquito, the carrier of the viral disease. The death toll has topped 1,400 so far this year, official data showed - more than five times that of 2022. With almost 300,000 infected. Hospitals are struggling to make space for patients as the disease spreads rapidly in the densely-populated country. Kabirul Basha, an entomologist and zoology professor at Jahangirnagar University, has spent most of his career studying mosquitoes. As authorities scramble to contain and treat the disease, Bashar decided to intensify his research on the mosquito that spreads it. Temperature, humidity and other components are changing patterns due to climate change. We are seeing monsoon-like rain in mid-October which is unusual. These seasonal pattern changes are creating the ideal situation for Aedes mosquito breeding. Aedes mosquitoes are adapting to these changes. Also, stranded rainwater creates perfect spots for Aedes mosquitoes to lay eggs and increase its density. Physicians have noted unusual symptoms this year, complicating diagnosis. And many people are symptom-free, suggesting case numbers could be far higher than those reported. Without a specific vaccine or drug to treat dengue, and hospitals facing shortages of essential supplies, Bashar suggests vector surveillance - a close examination of how the disease is spreading - is now needed year-round in Bangladesh.

The accused known as Aruna Deepthi, who was arrested by the Criminal Investigations Department (CID), was first placed in remand custody after being produced before Maligakanda Magistrates Court on November 01. On 30 October, the court imposed overseas travel bans on the owner of the company, accused of using forged documents to import a batch of vials of substandard immunoglobulin, and two other high-ranking government officials who were allegedly involved in this fraudulent activity. Accordingly, Sugath Janaka Fernando, also known as Aruna Deepthi, Chief Executive Officer of the National Medicines Regulatory Authority (NMRA) Dr. Vijith Gunasekara and Director (Supplies Division) of the Ministry of Health Dr. Kapila Wickramanayake were barred from flying out of the country.

The product, which was said to have been manufactured by Livealth Biopharma Pvt Ltd. India, was imported by a local medicine supplier called Isolez Biotech Pharma AG (Pvt) Ltd. However, the India-based manufacturer has denied having to do anything with this fraudulent activity and has communicated to the NMRA that it has neither manufactured, supplied nor exported these products to any party. It was found that funds amounting to Rs. 130 million were misappropriated through the unlawful importation of 22,500 vials of IVIG.

        "date": "November 15, 2023 04:15 pm",
        "content": "Britains Supreme Court ruled Wednesday that the governments contentious plan to send some migrants on a one-way trip to Rwanda is illegal, striking a major blow to a key policy of Prime Minister Rishi Sunaks government that has drawn international attention and criticism. Five justices on the countrys top court said asylum-seekers would be at real risk of ill-treatment because they could be sent back to their home countries once they were in Rwanda. Britain and Rwanda signed a deal in April 2022 to send some migrants who arrive in the U.K. across the English Channel to the East African country, where their asylum claims would be processed and, if successful, they would stay. Britains government argues that the Rwanda policy will deter people from risking their lives crossing one of the worlds busiest shipping lanes, and will break the business model of people-smuggling gangs. Opposition politicians, refugee groups and human rights organizations say the plan is unethical and unworkable. No one has yet been sent to the country as the plan was challenged in the courts. Reading the unanimous decision, President of the Supreme Court Robert Reed said Rwanda could not be relied on to keep the promises not to mistreat asylum-seekers sent from Britain. He cited the countrys poor human rights record, including enforced disappearances and torture, and practiced refoulement  sending migrants back to home countries where they could be at risk. The first deportation flight was stopped at the last minute in June 2022, when the European Court of Human Rights intervened. In December, the High Court in London ruled that the Rwanda plan is legal, but that the government must consider the individual circumstances of each case before putting anyone on a plane. The Court of Appeal in June backed a challenge by asylum-seekers from countries including Syria, Vietnam and Iran. The court ruled that the plan was unlawful because Rwanda is not a safe third country and there was a risk that migrants sent there would be returned to the home countries they had fled. That was challenged at the Supreme Court by the government, which argued at a hearing last month that it had thoroughly assessed the risks and would ensure that Rwandas government abides by its agreement to protect migrants rights. Much of Europe and the U.S. is struggling with how best to cope with migrants seeking refuge from war, violence, oppression and a warming planet that has brought devastating drought and floods. The U.K. receives fewer asylum-seekers than many European nations, including Germany, France and Italy. Thousands of migrants from around the world travel to northern France each year in hopes of crossing the Channel. Sunak has pledged to stop the boats. More than 27,300 migrants have crossed the Channel this year, with the years total on track to be fewer than the 46,000 who made the journey in 2022. The government says that shows its tough approach is working, though others cite factors including the weather. The Rwanda policy was championed by former Home Secretary Suella Braverman, who was fired by Sunak on Monday over a series of intemperate statements that deviated from the government line. In the weeks before her sacking she described migrants as a hurricane headed for Britain, called homelessness a lifestyle choice and accused police of being too lenient with pro-Palestinian protesters. Braverman has called for the U.K. to leave the European Convention on Human Rights and its court if the Rwanda plan is blocked. The U.K. government had said it aims to strike similar deportation deals with other countries if the Rwanda plan succeeds. It argues several other European countries are considering similar ideas, with the European Union exploring setting up processing centers on the blocs borders to screen people as they arrive. Italy recently reached a deal with Albania for the Balkan country to temporarily house and process some of the thousands of migrants who reach Italian shores. Unlike the U.K. plan, however, the journey would not be one-way. Successful asylum-seekers would get to start new lives in Italy, not Albania. Source - The San Diego Union Tribune - Agencies",

        "date": "November 15, 2023 04:20 pm",
        "content": "Finland on Tuesday accused Russia of funnelling asylum-seekers to its border and said it will take the necessary action to prevent a mass inflow of people and protect its national security. Prime Minister Petteri Orpo told a press conference that Russia had changed its practice by allowing people access to the border without required travel documents. It is clear that these people are helped and they are also being escorted or transported to the border by border guards, Orpo, of Finlands conservative National Coalition Party, said. While still small, the number of arrivals from Russia had jumped this week, according to Finlands border guard authority. Around 60 asylum seekers came via Russia since early Monday, the authority said. This contrasts with 91 people arriving without required documents from Aug. 1 to Nov. 12. Finland last year adopted legislation that allows its border authority to exceptionally stop receiving asylum applications at certain crossing points in case the Nordic nation became a target of mass immigration orchestrated by another country. NATO member Finland shares a 1,340-km (833-mile) border with Russia which also serves as the European Unions external border. The message from us in the government is clear in that we want to secure the safety of our eastern border, Orpo said. Finlands interior ministry will prepare a proposal that could allow officials to limit border traffic or the closing of some crossing points, Minister of Interior Mari Rantanen said earlier. Russias Federal Security Service (FSB), which is in charge of Russian border security, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Its not about the number of asylum seekers, but about Finlands national security and the change in Russias activities, Finance Minister Riikka Purra said in a post on X. Rantanen and Purra both belong to Finlands anti-immigration Finns Party, the second-largest party in Orpos coalition. Source: Reuters -Agencies",

        "title": "Sri Lankas ambitious budget agenda faces high implementation risks  Fitch",
        "date": "November 15, 2023 04:20 pm",
        "content": "The targets laid out in Sri Lankas budget for 2024 will be challenging to meet, even with the economic recovery that we expect to continue next year, says Fitch Ratings. The fiscal deficit is set to be wider than our current forecast of 7.1 of GDP in 2024 in light of the new data, even after excluding bank recapitalisation costs, and the revenueGDP ratio will be lower than we had assumed. The government is targeting a budget deficit of 9.1 of GDP in 2024, wider than a revised estimate of 8.5 in 2023. However, without bank recapitalisation costs, the deficit in 2024 would be a narrower 7.6 of GDP. Excluding recapitalisation costs, the budget targets a primary surplus of 0.8 of GDP in 2024, against a deficit of 0.7 in 2023. However, including recapitalisation costs pushes the 2024 primary deficit target to 0.6 of GDP. The primary surplus goal for 2024, excluding bank recapitalisation, is broadly in line with the 0.8 of GDP projected by the IMF in March when it approved Sri Lankas USD3 billion Extended Fund Facility (EFF). We also see the revenue target as relatively aligned. However, the governments expenditure target for 2024, at 22.2 of GDP, is somewhat higher than the 19.7 the IMF had envisioned and well above the revised budget estimate of 18.7 for 2023. The release of the next tranche of EFF financing, worth around USD330 million, will depend partly on the IMFs assessment of Sri Lankas progress in securing financing assurances from official creditors. Fitch believes there has been some progress since March, but the timeline for a restructuring deal with official creditors remains unclear. Fitch believes there are significant risks to the governments revenue goal for 2024. Sri Lanka has a record of fiscal slippage, and revenue collection fell 29 short of target over 9M23. The authorities aim to raise revenue by almost 45 in 2024. This will be aided by a planned 3pp increase in the value-added tax to 18, but the boost to revenue from inflation is set to weaken in 2024. We project consumer prices will rise by 8.7 on average in 2024, compared with 22.1 in 2023. The lift from economic growth, which Fitch projects at 3.3 in 2024, will also be modest. Downside risks to revenue could be offset by lower-than-budgeted spending. We think the presidential election in late 2024 will incentivise the government to keep to its spending plans, which include a 14 increase in spending on salaries and wages. Nevertheless, if revenue falls short, there may be some room to trim capital expenditure, which amounts to almost 20 of total planned spending and is budgeted to rise 55 in 2024, excluding bank recapitalisation. The governments efforts to implement governance reform after a recent diagnostic study by the IMF may also support revenue collection. The budget proposes to establish a new revenue authority under the Ministry of Finance to improve tax collection, and a new investment law will look to establish a National Economic Commission to promote investment. However, it will take time to assess these bodies effectiveness. Fitch rates Sri Lankas Long-Term Foreign-Currency Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at RD (Restricted Default). We may move the IDR out of RD upon the sovereigns completion of a commercial debt restructuring that we judge to have normalised the relationship with the international financial community. Sri Lankas post-default rating would depend upon our assessment of its credit profile. Fitch upgraded Sri Lankas Long-Term Local-Currency IDR to CCC- in September, reflecting the completion of the local-currency portion of Sri Lankas domestic debt optimisation plan.

        "date": "November 15, 2023 05:19 pm",
        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe has articulated plans to institute a Public Entertainment Classification Board in lieu of the Public Performance Board. Addressing the Presidential Film Awards 2023, held at the Nelum Pokuna Theatre in Colombo yesterday (14 Nov.), he underscored the importance of eliminating the term censorship from artistic creation. The President highlighted the current challenge faced by artists, as artistic creations fall under various criminal laws. To address this issue, he proposed a program wherein films and television productions would be submitted to the Classification Board before enforcement. President Ranil Wickremesinghe expressed the governments expectation to implement these measures starting next year. The Head of State also underscored the imperative need for Sri Lankan cinema to attain global acclaim. In dedicated pursuit of this objective, the government is proactively engaged in the comprehensive restructuring of the National Film Corporation and all its affiliated institutions to seamlessly integrate with cutting-edge technologies. This years Presidential Film Awards ceremony holds special importance as it marks a return after a 3 year hiatus. Out of 42 films screened in 2019 and 2020, a total of 44 awards were bestowed upon actors and technicians. These awards were traditionally bestowed upon individuals meticulously selected by a jury comprising expert film critics and seven honorary doctors and professors. Furthermore, nine additional awards were presented during the ceremony, adding to the prestige of the occasion. During the event, Dr. Nanda Malani was honoured as the Best Playback Singer of 2020. President Ranil Wickremesinghe went to the audience where Dr. Nanda Malani was seated to present her with the award for Best Playback Singer of 2020, the Presidents Media Division (PMD) reported. President Ranil Wickremesinghe, addressing the audience, acknowledged Dr. Nanda Malanis significant achievement of receiving an award for her background singing in Sri Lankan cinema at the Sarasavi Film Award in 1963. The President also shared that he had the privilege of participating in that event. Emphasizing Dr. Nanda Malanis noteworthy contributions, the President conveyed that she rightfully deserves the respect and gratitude of the entire nation for her valuable contributions to both the Sri Lankan cinema and music industry. In recognition of exceptional contributions to cinema, a Yuga Abhimani special award was conferred upon Mr. K. Gunaratnam. President Ranil Wickremesinghe commemorated Mr. Gunaratnam during the ceremony. Additionally, the President presented Swarnasingha awards to distinguished individuals, namely Mr. Chandrun Ratnam, Suvineetha Weerasinghe, and Cyril Wickramage, further adding to the prestige of the occasion. The President conferred prestigious awards on notable individuals in the cinematic realm. In recognition of their outstanding performances, Mr. Kamal Addararachchi was honoured as the Best Actor of 2019, and Mr. Kumara Thirimadura received the Best Actor award for 2020. Likewise, Ms. Samadhi Laksiri was recognized as the Best Actress of 2019 and Ms. Neeta Fernando received the Best Actress award for 2020, both presented by the President. Acknowledging excellence in direction, Mr. Anuruddha Jayasinghe was awarded the Best Director for the year 2019, while Mr. Vishakesa Chandrasekharam received the Best Director award for 2020, both bestowed upon them by the President. The film industry also celebrated outstanding cinematic creations, with the Best Film of 2019 titled Ginnen Upan Seethala and the Best Film of 2020 titled The Newspaper, both receiving accolades from the President. The President further stated: In my youth, as a student aged 12-13, I had the privilege of participating in the inaugural Sarasavi Film Awards ceremony. Similarly, I had the honour of attending the inaugural Presidential Film Awards ceremony. The disparity between those times and the contemporary era is substantial, marked notably by a significant technological revolution. Presently, the landscape includes both cinema and television, formerly distinct entities that have seamlessly converged. The advent of mobile technology has further transformed how we consume content, with the ability to watch movies on portable devices. This connectivity has fostered a global cohesion in the realm of international cinema, turning it into a thriving industry. It is imperative that we progress harmoniously with this evolving industry. I hold a firm belief in the prowess of our film makers to navigate and excel in the competitive arena. Consequently, we must reconsider our perspectives and diligently prepare the nations cinema for a transformative journey ahead. In our focus on the reorganization of the National Film Corporation, it is essential to recognize the film industry and television media as integral components of a unified industry. Concurrently, comprehensive development initiatives are imperative for all cinema halls and film production locations. To streamline and provide efficient support, the government is actively consolidating these activities under a singular board. Beyond financial backing, a strategic program is in progress to bring globally renowned individuals to Sri Lanka, offering invaluable opportunities for artists, directors, and technicians to acquire international expertise. Furthermore, proactive measures are anticipated Performance Board control. The existing Public Performance Board Act, with over a century in force, will be replaced by the establishment of a distinguished Entertainment Classification Board, marking a pivotal step towards modernization and efficiency in this sector. The elimination of the term censorship from artworks is imperative. Presently, artworks are subjected to diverse criminal laws, causing challenges for artists. It is crucial to reassess and adapt to contemporary needs, acknowledging that adhering strictly to out-dated regulations is untenable. To address this, a comprehensive program is underway, envisioning the submission of films and television products to the classification board as a preliminary step. These proposed regulations are anticipated to be presented next year. The collective support of all, irrespective of political affiliations, is sought, emphasizing the programs significance for the future prosperity of the film industry. The event was graced by the presence of distinguished guests, including Speaker Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena, Ministers Dr. Bandula Gunawardena, Mahinda Amaraweera, Presidents Counsel Dr. Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe, Keheliya Rambukwella, State Ministers Shantha Bandara, Lasantha Alagiyawanna, Members of Parliament Wajira Abeywardena, Gayantha Karunathilaka, and Rear Admiral Sarath Weerasekera (Retired).

        "date": "November 15, 2023 06:59 pm",
        "content": "The latest honor for Salman Rushdie was a prize kept secret until minutes before he rose from his seat to accept it. On Tuesday night, the author received the first-ever Lifetime Disturbing the Peace Award, presented by the Vaclav Havel Center on Manhattans Upper East Side. Only a handful of the more than 100 attendees had advance notice about Rushdie, whose whereabouts have largely been withheld from the general public since he was stabbed repeatedly in August of 2022 during a literary festival in Western New York. I apologize for being a mystery guest, Rushdie said Tuesday night after being introduced by Reading Lolita in Tehran author Azar Nafisi. I dont feel at all mysterious. But it made life a little simpler. The Havel center, founded in 2012 as the Vaclav Havel Library Foundation, is named for the Czech playwright and dissident who became the last president of Czechoslovakia after the fall of the Communist regime in the late 1980s. The center has a mission to advance the legacy of Havel, who died in 2011 and was known for championing human rights and free expression. Numerous writers and diplomats attended Tuesdays ceremony, hosted by longtime CBS journalist Lesley Stahl. Alaa Abdel-Fattah, the imprisoned Egyptian activist, was given the Disturbing the Peace Award to a Courageous Writer at Risk. His aunt, the acclaimed author and translator Adhaf Soueif, accepted on his behalf and said he was aware of the prize. Hes very grateful, she said. He was particularly pleased by the name of the award, Disturbing the Peace. This really tickled him. Abdel-Fattah, who turns 42 later this week, became known internationally during the 2011 pro-democracy uprisings in the Middle East that drove out Egypts longtime President Hosni Mubarak. He has since been imprisoned several times under the presidency of Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi, making him a symbol for many of the countrys continued autocratic rule. Rushdie, 76, noted that last month he had received the Peace Prize of the German Book Trade, and now was getting a prize for disturbing the peace, leaving him wondering which side of the fence he was on. He spent much of his speech praising Havel, a close friend whom he remembered as being among the first government leaders to defend him after the novelist was driven into hiding by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeinis 1989 decree calling for his death over the alleged blasphemy of The Satanic Verses. Rushdie said Havel was kind of a hero of mine who was able to be an artist at the same time as being an activist. He was inspirational to me as for many, many writers, and to receive an award in his name is a great honor, Rushdie added. Source: The Associated Press --Agencies",

Colombo Additional Magistrate Rajindra Jayasuriya issued this order today (Nov. 15), stating that the said order will be rescinded as the court feels it is no longer necessary to suspend the insurance payments to the concerned parties. Furthermore, the Additional Magistrate further mentioned that it has not been revealed that any other party is trying to obtain the said compensation. On November 08, the Colombo Magistrates Court issued an order to the relevant officials of the insurance companies to suspend the payment of the insurance compensation to the concerned beneficiaries, for a period of one week after considering a request made by the Police Homicide and Organized Crimes Division. Earlier this month, the court determined that the death of businessman Dinesh Schaffter occurred as a result of an external pressure applied on his neck and the facial area, after the five-member experts committee comprising Judicial Medical Officers appointed to uncover the actual cause of death of the late businessman Schaffter submitted its report on the post-mortems to the court. Accordingly, the magistrate who ruled that a crime had been committed through this incident, ordered the Director of the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) to arrest the relevant suspects and produce them before the courts. There, the Additional Magistrate ordered the CID to take measures to hand over the remains of the late businessman, which are currently placed at the Karapitiya Teaching Hospital, to his family members. She also ordered to provide necessary facilities for the burial of the remains at the Jawatte Cemetery, as per the previous court orders. Former Director of the Janashakthi PLC Group, Dinesh Schaffter, was found tied up in his car at the General Cemetery in Borella on 15 December 2022 and died a day later while receiving treatment at the ICU of the National Hospital in Colombo.",

        "title": "2024 Budgets success inherently tied to timely execution  Ceylon Chamber",
        "date": "November 15, 2023 07:19 pm",
        "content": "The Ceylon Chamber of Commerce has deemed the 2024 Budget as a crucial step in continuing the macroeconomic stabilization measures that began in late 2022, as a response to the economic challenges faced by Sri Lanka. Issuing a release in this regard on Tuesday (14 Nov.), the Chamber stated that the 2024 Budget takes a resolute approach to address the severe macroeconomic mismanagement in the country, identified as one of the main challenges faced by Sri Lankas economy. Speaking further on the 2024 Budget, the Chamber stated that the enforcement of fiscal forbearance in monetary policy through the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) Act, and the strengthening of fiscal rules via the Public Finance Management (PFM) Bill are foundational for re-establishing effective macroeconomic management. The Budget 2024 emphasizes fiscal discipline and adherence to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) Extended Fund Facility (EFF) program targets, recognizing these as pivotal for achieving macroeconomic stability. It sets ambitious but broadly realizable revenue targets, essential for the economic recovery and securing the second tranche disbursement from the IMF. The introduction of practical measures such as requiring a Tax Identification Number (TIN) for opening bank accounts, building plan approvals, vehicle registration, and land purchases increase the number of tax files and thus broadening the tax base are steps towards enhancing tax revenue efficiency, the statement issued by the Chamber read. Further acknowledging that several of the Chambers recommendations were included in the 2024 Budget, particularly in tax administration, trade facilitation, digitalization, climate finance, and public sector reform, the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce noted that the expedited implementation of these reforms including fast tracking the digital ID process holds immense potential to play an integral role in reshaping economic revival, enhancing tax revenues, and accelerating development. Other trade related reforms such as phasing out non-tariff barriers in trade, expediting the National Single Window included in the 2024 Budget were also identified as crucial elements for stimulating investment, trade, and growth. The budgets focus on factor market reforms, modernizing land and labor legislation, aligns with the Chambers view that economic growth is fostered through comprehensive reforms. The introduction of a separate revenue authority and the emphasis on increased private sector participation are strategic initiatives to enhance revenue collection and stimulate economic growth. Furthermore, the budgets focus on debt restructuring is crucial, as it plays a pivotal role in rebuilding investor confidence, which in turn is key to attracting foreign direct investment (FDI). This inflow of FDI is essential for catalysing economic growth. Additionally, the budget introduces specific sector-focused measures aimed at stimulating development and enhancing the competitiveness of key industries. These measures include releasing land for agricultural use, facilitating the establishment of private universities, and implementing reforms in the tourism sector. The modernization and rapid implementation of these initiatives, along with ongoing reforms in state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and the banking sector, are imperative for realizing the full potential of economic growth. Thus, while deeming the 2024 Budget as a significant step towards correcting past economic mismanagement and laying a foundation for sustainable growth, with a promising framework in this regard, the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce stressed that the success of the Budget is inherently tied to the rigour and efficiency of its implementation.",

        "date": "November 15, 2023 08:05 pm",
        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe addressing the Budget 2024 Forum under the theme A Tightrope Walk organised by the Colombo University MBA Alumni Association stressed the importance of Sri Lankan universities being world-class and acknowledged the challenge of balancing financial considerations with the goal of providing quality education. He presented a broader perspective on the budget, drawing inspiration from President Roosevelts New Deal approach, emphasizing the need for a comprehensive strategy beyond a traditional budget. The President in his capacity as the Finance Minister highlighted efforts to stabilize and reconstruct the economy, including negotiations with the IMF and bilateral discussions, aiming for positive results in December. Delivering the keynote address at this event held at the Shangri La Hotel in Colombo, the President defended the budget as more focused on building a new economy that benefits the people rather than being labelled as an election budget. He discussed pay increases for government servants, adjustments in the private sector and increased expenditure on social programs like Samurdhi and support for SMEs. He underscored the importance of paying for quality government services while ensuring assistance for those who cannot afford it. President Wickremesinghe revealed a significant three-fold increase in Aswesuma benefits in the budget as part of a new social construct. He also acknowledged the extensive nature of the countrys current crisis, adding that it surpasses the governments capacity to address it within a single budget. He stressed the importance of adaptation, highlighting the necessity for embracing change and emphasized that this commitment to change is the direction the government is currently heading. In this comprehensive address, the President outlined key initiatives, including the largest privatization in Sri Lanka, granting 2 million acres to the people and converting permit holders into land owners. The President emphasized the dispersal of ownership and wealth among the population, aligning with constitutional principles. Additionally, plans for partial privatization of banks was also discussed, with a focus on employee and depositor participation. President Wickremesinghe highlighted the importance of a highly competitive and digitized economy, urging private sector involvement. He outlined goals for digitalization and discussed the privatization of Sri Lanka Telecom. Energy transformation was also emphasized, with a focus on green energy, setting the stage for Sri Lanka to lead in this area. The address also covered plans for agriculture modernization, particularly in the dry zone and the expansion of fisheries. Tourism was identified as a potential growth sector, with an aim to attract 5 million tourists at a targeted rate. President Wickremesinghe also outlines diverse areas of focus for economic development. Acknowledging the need for competitiveness in manufacturing, he discusses engagements with India, RCEP, ASEAN countries and the EU. Recognizing challenges in competing with mass-producing countries like Bangladesh and emerging economies, the President advocated for a leapfrog approach and emphasized the importance of education reform to support economic shifts. A comprehensive change in the education system was revealed, with a 10-year timeline and a focus on opening new universities, including collaboration with India for an IIT campus in Kandy. The President highlighted the potential for regional logistics by developing Sri Lanka as a hub, particularly focusing on the main port and potential developments in Trincomalee. He noted that the goal is to reorient the economy to achieve a modern economy by 2030-2035. President Wickremesinghe emphasized that the budget is just one part of the broader economic plan, discussing the need for periodic statements and new laws to address the evolving economic landscape. Stressing the importance of change, the Minister encouraged collaboration with the private sector, foreign assistance and retired professionals to overcome implementation challenges and mobilize the country for economic progress. The President also placed the onus on the collective willingness to move forward, acknowledging that without such commitment, the governments role is limited. The members of the panel at this forum were Mahinda Siriwardana  Secretary to the Treasury, Dr. Nandalal Weerasinghe, Ms Chiyo Kanda  Country Manager World Bank Sri Lanka and Maldives, W.A.

        "date": "November 15, 2023 08:34 pm",
        "content": "Through the 2024 Budget proposals, the government has decided to allocate Rs. 450 billion to recapitalize the state banks in order to secure stability and provide security as the government is in the process of restructuring the local debt accumulated by the state-owned enterprises, Treasury Secretary Mahinda Siriwardana said. Delivering the keynote address at an expert panel discussion organized by the Centre for Banking Studies under the theme Decoding the National Budget 2024, he revealed that the recapitalization will not affect the local rupee-denominated markets. He also added that although the government is able to increase the salaries of state employees in the upcoming year, it is not possible to provide tax relief as Sri Lanka continues to be behind the revenue targets set by the International Monetary Fund (IMF). According to the budget proposals for 2024, the Ceylon Petroleum Corporations debt is valued at Rs. 1 trillion while the Ceylon Electricity Board has an accumulated debt of Rs. 800 billion owed to the state banks. Due to the debt restructuring process, banks face the risk of recording large losses which will have to be met by capital infusions from taxpayer funds, he added. In addition to the Rs. 450 billion alloted for recapitalization, it is proposed that 20 of the shares of the two large state-owned banks should be given to strategic investors or the public to improve capital and reduce the burden on taxpayers funds, according to the Treasury Secretary.",

        "date": "November 15, 2023 09:52 pm",
        "content": "From record-breaking temperatures to increasing extreme weather events, in 2022 alone Asia recorded 81 weather, climate and water-related disasters which directly affected more than 50 million people, costing USD 36 billion in economic damages, according to the World Meteorological Organisations State of the Climate in Asia report. The global landscape is changing dramatically with the climate crisis becoming the new normal. Sri Lanka too is reeling from multiple crises and with climate change impacts already being experienced, recovery comes at a high cost. Sri Lanka annually spends LKR 50 billion on climate-induced post-disaster contingent liabilities that arise through floods, droughts, landslides, and storms including relief assistance for damages incurred to housing, infrastructure, agricultural crops, and businesses. The Paris Agreement lays out a collective framework for all countries to address climate change. But reports come in that there is still limited progress in reducing the emissions gap by 2030, and there is a global call to scale up climate action to keep the 1.5C objective within reach. Responding to this call, led by the Ministry of Environment and supported by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)s Climate Promise Phase II Project, Sri Lanka has ramped up their commitment to achieving the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) and has outlined targets in an Implementation Plan till 2030, focusing on an integrated, holistic approach to enable transformative impact across sectors, the Ministry of Environment and UNDP said in a joint statement.. To launch Sri Lankas NDC Implementation Plan, a briefing was held this afternoon in collaboration with the Ministry of Environment. Speaking at this high-level forum, Dr. Anil Jasinghe, Secretary, Ministry of Environment stated, Sri Lanka accelerated its climate action through the launch of the Climate Prosperity Plan at COP27. The revised National Policy on Climate Change (2023) and 2050 Carbon Net Zero Road Map and Strategy are expected to be launched at COP28 this year. The NDCs act as the base for these strategic interventions and implementing the NDCs will lead to increasing Sri Lankas share of renewable energy, adopting adaptation interventions and increasing our coping capacity and resilience to climate disasters. Sharing progress on Sri Lankas NDCs, Dr. Jayathunga, Additional Secretary (Environment Development), Ministry of Environment highlighted, The NDCs are a nexus and linking point through which we can reinforce our national sustainable development targets including the targets laid out in our National Environment Action Plan and National Adaptation Plan. Operationalizing the NDC Implementation Plan, especially the unconditional targets will require mobilizing significant financial resources and exploring innovative financial instruments and different sources of finance including the private sector. Ms. Malin Herwig, Officer-In-Charge, UNDP shared, Smart investments in the NDC sectors and targets can stimulate economic recovery and set Sri Lanka on a trajectory to carbon neutral pathways and improve climate resilience over the longer term. The NDC Implementation Plan sets out a blueprint for immediate climate action. With the first global stocktake of progress on the Paris Agreement scheduled for discussion at the 28th session of the Conference of Parties (COP28) in Dubai later this year, it is an opportunity for all countries to course correct and accelerate action to tackle the climate crisis, the joint statement said.",

        "date": "November 15, 2023 10:14 pm",
        "content": "United States President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping will try to stop the superpowers rivalry from spilling into conflict when they meet for the first time in a year at a high-stakes summit in San Francisco on Wednesday. With tensions soaring over issues that include Taiwan, sanctions and trade, the leaders of the worlds two largest economies are expected to hold at least three hours of talks at a country estate on the outskirts of the Californian city. The carefully choreographed meeting on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in California is due to start with a formal handshake at 10:45 a.m., followed by bilateral talks behind closed doors that include a working lunch. The 80-year-old Biden held out an olive branch to Xi, 70, on the eve of the talks, insisting that the United States was not trying to decouple from China and wanted to improve the relationship. But the US leader could not resist adding later at a fundraising dinner that, under communist Xi, China faced real problems, while Biden claimed to be reestablishing American leadership in the world. China responded with a Foreign Ministry spokeswoman pointing out all countries had problems, including the US, while sticking to positive talking points on the summit. The key to stabilizing and improving China-US relations is both sides working together, and the most fundamental condition is mutual respect, ministry spokesman Mao Ning said. The two leaders have not met in person since they held talks on the sidelines of the Group of 20 summit on Indonesias resort island of Bali in November 2022, and relations nosedived after the US shot down an alleged Chinese spy balloon in February this year. The talks also come against the backdrop of a long struggle for global primacy between the US and an increasingly assertive China. One of the most sensitive issues is Taiwan, the self-ruling democratic island over which Beijing claims sovereignty and which it has not ruled out seizing by force. Biden is expected to warn China not to interfere in elections that will be held in two months in Taiwan, arguing that it would raise tensions. This is a complex relationship, a competitive relationship, that could easily veer into conflict or confrontation if its not well managed, US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said on Monday. Beijing and Washington have been locked in a flurry of high-level diplomacy in recent months that resulted in the announcement less than a week before the summit that Xi was coming. Announcements not expected Expectations of major announcements are low, but the two countries have trailed a series of possible wins from Xis first visit to US soil since he was hosted by then-president Donald Trump in 2017. One of Bidens key objectives is the restoration of the two countries military hotline, which Beijing severed after then-House speaker Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan in August 2022, a senior US administration official said. There were also hopes of progress on cooperation to limit Chinese exports of ingredients for fentanyl, the drug that has devastated American cities, including San Francisco, the official added. The two leaders were additionally expected to discuss the wars in Israel and Ukraine, in which the two governments find themselves backing opposing sides, adding to global tensions. On the eve of the summit, Beijing and Washington also pledged to work more closely together on global warming, declaring in a joint statement that the climate crisis was one of the greatest challenges of our time. For his part, Xi is expected to push for an end to trade curbs and sanctions, with the Chinese economy struggling to shore up growth after its tough zero-Covid policy. The Chinese leader will host a dinner with US executives after the summit to send a message that China is still a good place to invest, the US official said. Biden and Xi both landed on Tuesday in San Francisco, where thousands of people lined the streets waving the red and gold flags of China and carrying banners welcoming the Chinese leader.

        "date": "November 16, 2023 07:36 am",
        "content": "(AP)  The U.N. Security Council on Wednesday adopted its first resolution since the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war, calling for urgent and extended humanitarian pauses in Gaza to address the escalating crisis for Palestinian civilians during Israels aerial and ground attacks. The vote in the 15-member council was 12-0 with the United States, United Kingdom and Russia abstaining. The U.S. and U.K. abstained because of the resolutions failure to condemn Hamas surprise cross-border attacks into Israel on Oct. 7, and Russia because of its failure to demand a humanitarian cease-fire, which Israel and the United States oppose. The final draft watered down language from demands to calls for humanitarian pauses, and for the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages held by Hamas and other groups. Still, the resolution, which was sponsored by Malta, managed to overcome the serious differences that had prevented the council from adopting four previous resolutions. What we have achieved today is an important first step, Maltas U.N. Ambassador Vanessa Frazier said. We will remain steadfast in our commitment to the protection of civilians and the plight of children in armed conflict that continue to suffer in a disproportionate manner. The resolution doesnt mention the Oct. 7 attacks in Israel, where Hamas militants killed around 1,200 people and took some 240 others hostage. Nor does it mention Israels response with airstrikes and a ground offensive in Hamas-ruled Gaza that the territorys health ministry says have killed more than 11,000 Palestinians, two-thirds of them women and children. Russias U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia tried unsuccessfully to amend the resolution just before the vote with language from a resolution adopted Oct. 27 by the 193-member General Assembly. It calls for an immediate, durable and sustained humanitarian truce leading to a cessation of hostilities. The vote on the amendment was five countries in favor, the U.S. opposed, and nine abstentions. It was not adopted because it failed to get the minimum nine yes votes. Nebenzia said he abstained on the resolution because of appeals from the region for council action on the dire humanitarian situation. But he called it a disgrace that the council, which has a uniquely powerful toolbox including sanctions and even military action, finally squeezed out such a weak call. As the old saying goes, the mountain has labored and brought forth a mouse, the Russian ambassador said. U.S. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield said she remains horrified that a few council members cant condemn Hamas barbaric terrorist attack, and criticized the resolution for not reaffirming every countrys right to self-defense. She did note that the resolution is the first ever adopted that even mentions the word Hamas. Nonetheless, Thomas-Greenfield called the resolution a step forward and said the U.S. supports its calls for humanitarian pauses and the release of hostages. United Arab Emirates Ambassador Lana Nusseibeh, the Arab representative on the council, said its members supported the resolution, which is the first on the situation in the Palestinian territories since 2016. It is difficult geopolitical times, and to bring the unity of the council today to speak with one voice on the subject that has haunted all of us over the last month is, I think, momentous, she said. The resolution is a first, important and overdue step and will change the worlds perception that the Security Council is indifferent, Nusseibeh said. But the world must not lose sight of the urgent goal of a lasting humanitarian cease-fire, she said. Israels U.N. Ambassador Gilad Erdan issued a statement saying the resolution is disconnected from reality and is meaningless. He criticized the councils failure to condemn Hamas, claiming the militants were deliberately allowing the humanitarian situation to deteriorate so the United Nations would pressure Israel to back off of Gaza. It will not happen, Erdan said. Israel will continue to act until Hamas is destroyed and the hostages are returned. U.N. Security Council resolutions are legally binding, unlike General Assembly resolutions, but in practice many parties choose to ignore the councils requests for action. Richard Gowan, U.N. director for the International Crisis Group, said the Security Council has called for cease-fires in wars from the Balkans to Syria with little or no impact. The General Assembly resolution was approved on Oct. 27 by a vote of 120-14 with 45 abstentions. Since then, Israel agreed Nov. 9 to four-hour pauses. But only limited aid has been delivered to Gaza through the Rafah crossing from Egypt, and a humanitarian catastrophe has been brewing. Gowan said that the council was able to speak at all gives its member nations some respite, but would likely not have any significant impact. The resolution is drafted in a way that puts no real political pressure on Israel, but the U.S. will likely urge Israel to show more flexibility on aid issues to satisfy global opinion, Gowan told The Associated Press. The council will not move from this text to a call for a cease-fire, unless facts change significantly on the ground. The resolution calls for humanitarian pauses and corridors throughout the Gaza Strip for a sufficient number of days for unhindered access by the U.N., Red Cross and other aid groups to get water, electricity, fuel, food and medical supplies to all those in need. It says the pauses also should allow for repair of essential infrastructure and enable urgent rescue and recovery efforts. It demands that all parties comply with their obligations under international law, notably with regard to the protection of civilians, especially children. It also asks U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres to report to the council at its next monthly Mideast meeting, on Nov. 28, on implementing the resolution. Asked afterward about Israels rejection of the resolution, Maltas Frazier and the UAEs Nusseibeh said it remains legally binding and pointed to Guterres upcoming report. Nusseibeh said the secretary-general has been asked to bring ideas on what the U.N. would need for further monitoring and implementation on the ground. Riyad Mansour, the Palestinian U.N. ambassador, said the Security Council should have called for a cease-fire a long time ago, stressing that Gaza bleeds death, devastation, destruction everywhere. It is a small, modest resolution, he said. Israel considers all of us terrorists, he told the council after the vote. Israel is not under threat of destruction. It is destroying Palestine. It considers the Palestinian state as a strategic threat. It is against Palestinian rule anywhere. Mansour said the Palestinians will keep coming back to the Security Council and the General Assembly for action, first and foremost for a cease-fire. Source: AP --Agencies",

        "date": "November 16, 2023 10:30 am",
        "content": "Minister of Transport, Highways and Mass Media, Bandula Gunawardena emphasized that addressing the prevailing crisis of the country requires an exclusive focus on economic solutions, highlighting the inadequacy of political measures in this context. The Minister further highlighted that once the International Monetary Fund (IMF) issues the second loan installment, it will pave the way for the resumption of all stalled development projects, the Presidents Media Division (PMD) reported. Gunawardena conveyed this information during his participation in a Media briefing held at the Presidential Media Centre (PMC) on Wednesday (15), under the theme Collective path to a stable country. Minister Gunawardena, in his extended remarks, characterized this years budget, presented by President Ranil Wickremesinghe, as historic, radical and revolutionary. He highlighted its significance as the first budget unveiled following the official declaration of the countrys bankruptcy last year. The Minister underscored that the state budgets current account deficit and the international balance of payments current account deficit were pivotal factors leading to the countrys financial crisis. He further revealed that the failure to meet International Monetary Fund criteria during the respective periods as a contributing factor to the current crisis. To navigate the country out of the current crisis, a strategic approach involves focusing on four key aspects. Firstly, there is an imperative to enhance government revenue. Secondly, it is essential to curtail both recurrent and capital expenditures of the government. The third element involves boosting foreign exchange inflows while concurrently minimizing foreign exchange outflows. Lastly, the goal is to establish a current account surplus in the balance of payments. The budget presented by the President for the year 2024 is aligned with these crucial objectives. Moreover, the existing national debt stands at approximately US  36 billion. Notably, only 37 of this debt is slated for payment within the next 5 to 6 years, with 51 of the loan amount scheduled for repayment between 6 and 20 years. The remaining 12 is earmarked for settlement after the 20-year mark. Its crucial to acknowledge that irrespective of the governing party, the country is obligated to service this debt until the year 2048. Failure to meet these financial commitments would result in a governing partys ability to administer the government for only a two-week duration. Avoiding loans from global entities and defaulting on payments poses a critical challenge, as the current international system relies on this financial mechanism. In addition, refusal of other nations to accept letters of credit issued by Sri Lanka would hinder the importation of vital commodities such as petroleum, gas, medicines and essential food items. Consequently, political solutions prove ineffective in addressing this predicament; instead, the imperative lies in implementing an economic solution to navigate through these challenges. President Ranil Wickremesinghe assumed responsibility amid financial management challenges. A resolution was achieved through debt restructuring, involving consultations with leaders from creditor states, including India, China and Japan. Following the budget, the International Monetary Fund is expected to issue the second loan tranche. Successful refinancing of the debt would provide ample resources to execute all the proposals outlined in the budget. Subsequently, the revival of all stalled development projects becomes feasible. It is crucial for everyone to bear in mind that the anticipated increase in government employees salaries, as per the budget, is contingent upon the tax revenues collected by the government from the public.",

Speaking further in this regard, SLPP MP Namal Rajapaksa stated that the SLPP will only highlight any discrepancies in the Budget, but they will continue to support it. It is the duty of the Opposition to defeat the Bill. But it is our duty to identify any discrepancies in the Bill, and point them out, he said, adding that the problem did not lie with the Budget nor its proposals, but its implementation. The Budget is not a bad one, but the problem is that the proposals included in the Budget are not implemented properly. Several proposals in this Budget were also stated in last years Budget.",

Venkateshwaran, on Wednesday, said talks are on to revive direct flight connection from Coimbatore to Sri Lanka, as part of a slew of incentives the island nation is providing to Indian businesses to encourage bilateral trade and investments. Speaking at the Coimbatore Indian Chamber of Commerce and Industrys (ICCI) 14th council meeting, Mr. Venkateshwaran highlighted the reasons why Indian entrepreneurs should invest in Sri Lanka despite its growing foreign debt which currently stands at 86 Billion. Culture, logistical advantages, air connectivity, linguistic connection, geo-location and cosmopolitan set-up are some of the incentives Sri Lanka provides India, he said. While the countrys political and financial instability continues to remain unfavourable for entrepreneurs to set up shop in Sri Lanka, Mr. Venkateshwaran highlighted the advancement the nation has achieved in skill development among the nations youth population and the development of tourism and real estate sectors. We are focusing on providing skilled personnel that can help businesses that come to Sri Lanka. At the same time, our economy is slowly picking up as tourism is helping us repay debt, he told The Hindu. Source: The Hindu --Agencies",

        "content": "An investigation is due to be carried out into the participation of COPE chairman Prof. Ranjith Bandaras son, Kanishka Bandara, during the recent Committee on Public Enterprises (COPE) meeting held with Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) officials. Accordingly, Speaker Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena had stated in Parliament this morning (16 Nov.), that an investigation will be carried out into the participation of the COPE Chairmans son in the said meeting. The issue was raised in the House by Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa, who claimed that the Prof. Bandaras son had no right to sit amongst the members of the COPE. What right does he have to come to the COPE. And what did youll as Parliament officials, do about it? I would like for you to give an answer on this now, without saying the matter will be looked into or that it will be discussed later. Tell me, what right does the son of the COPE chairman have to sit at a COPE meeting, when not even the Leader of the Opposition is allowed to do so. It is a right that not even I possess. Tell me, how did he come? Is it allowed?, Premadasa asked Speaker Abeywardena. Premadasa further urged that the required measures be taken for Prof. Bandara to be temporarily suspended as the COPE Chairman, until its meetings with SLC have concluded, due to a conflict of interest. The Opposition Leader presented several documents in Parliament, evidencing the fact that Prof. Bandara serves as a consultant for SLC on the Kandy Cricket Campus project, apart from another consultancy firm, owned by Prof. Bandara, providing its services to the SLC. He further questioned whether Prof. Bandara should be allowed to serve as the COPE chairman at all, on account of the fact that he did not disclose his connection to SLC, and continued to act as the COPE Chairman despite this possible conflict of interest.",

        "content": "The case filed pertaining to the Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) Interim Committee is due to be taken up before the Court of Appeal on 20 November. Accordingly, the case will be taken up before a new panel of Appellate Court Judges on Monday, Ada Derana reporter said. The relevant order was issued by an Appellate Court bench comprising of Judges D. N. Samarakoon and Neil Iddawela when the case was taken up this morning (16 Nov.), during which the latter had recused himself from the hearing of the case. Thus, the case was forwarded to the President of the Court of Appeal, Judge Nissanka Bandula Karunaratne, in order to name a new panel of Judges. Accordingly, the case is slated to be heard before an Appellate Court bench comprising of Judges Sobhitha Rajakaruna and D. N. Samarkoon, as per a decision made by the President of the Court of Appeal. So far, three Judges, including the Appeals Court President and Judge Neil Iddawela, have recused themselves from the hearing of the relevant case. On 07 November, the Court of Appeal issued a 14-day stay order, preventing the operation of the seven-member Interim Committee appointed SLC and the relevant gazette notification issued by Sports Minister Roshan Ranasinghe in this regard. The relevant order was issued by a two-member judge bench consisting of Appeals Court President Nissanka Bandula Karunaratne and Justice Vikum Kaluarachchi, upon consideration of a writ petition filed by the Chairman of SLC Shammi Silva. Accordingly, the court has issued three stay orders in total pertaining to the matter: the first to prevent the gazette issued by the Sports Minister appointing the interim committee for the SLC, the second to prevent the committee members chaired by Arjuna Ranatunga from acting in their respective positions and the third to prevent the respondents including the Sports Minister from interfering the activities of the petitioner and the other officials of cricket board. Subsequently, on 13 November, Sports Minister Roshan Ranasinghe filed a motion requesting the lifting of the stay order issued by the Court of Appeal preventing the operation of the 7-member Interim Committee appointed by him for the SLC and the relevant gazette notification published in this regard. The motion including the objections related to the relevant stay order, has been filed before the Appeals Court through Attorney-at-Law G.G. Arulpragasam. A seven-member Interim Committee was appointed by Sports Minister Roshan Ranasinghe on 06 November, chaired by World Cup-winning former Sri Lanka captain Arjuna Ranatunga. The interim committee consists of the following members: S. I. Imam, Retired Supreme Court Judge; Rohini Marasinghe, Retired Supreme Court Judge; Irangani Perera, Retired High Court Judge; Arjuna Ranatunga (Chairman); Upali Dharmadasa; Rakitha Rajapakshe, Attorney-at-Law; and Hisham Jamaldeen.",

        "title": "US and China agree to resume military communications after summit",
        "date": "November 16, 2023 11:45 am",
        "content": "The US and China have agreed to resume military-to-military communications in an effort to ease rising tensions, President Joe Biden says. Were back to direct, open, clear communications, he said following a rare meeting with Chinas President Xi Jinping in California on Wednesday. It was the first time the pair had spoken in person in more than a year. Mr Biden also said both leaders had agreed to establish a direct line of communication with one another. At a news conference following the summit, which took place at a historic country estate near San Francisco, Mr Biden said a lack of communication was how accidents happen and added that both presidents could now pick up the phone and be directly heard immediately. China severed military-to-military communications last year after then-US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan. Beijing views self-ruled Taiwan as its territory, and has threatened to annex it by force if necessary. Mr Biden said that, while many disagreements remained between the pair, Mr Xi had just been straight. He said the talks were some of the most constructive and productive discussions weve had. But in a sign of how difficult relations still are, Mr Biden, as he was exiting the stage, responded to a reporters question by saying he considered Mr Xi a dictator. Hes a dictator in the sense that he is a guy who runs a country... based on a form of government that is totally different from ours, he said. When Mr Biden made a similar comment in June, Chinese officials reacted angrily and described it as extremely absurd and irresponsible. As well as resuming military communications, the two sides announced several other agreements in areas that have become sources of tension in recent times. These included taking steps to tackle the flow of fentanyl into the US, which has contributed to a rise in overdose deaths in the country. Chinese manufacturing companies are a source not only of the synthetic opioid itself but of precursor chemicals which can be combined to make it. Were taking action to significantly reduce the flow of precursor chemicals and pill presses from China to the Western Hemisphere, Mr Biden said. Under the deal, China will directly target companies that are producing those precursor chemicals. It will save lives, Mr Biden told reporters. The two leaders also discussed the conflict in Israel and Gaza. One senior US official told reporters that Mr Biden had asked China to use its influence with Iran to urge it not to take steps that could be seen as provocative. The two superpowers also agreed to jointly examine artificial intelligence (AI), and had a lengthy conversation about Taiwan which, according to one US official, Mr Xi said was the biggest, most dangerous issue in US-China ties. Following the talks, China said the communications restored between the two militaries were done so on the basis of equality and respect. Planet Earth is big enough for the two countries to succeed, and one countrys success is an opportunity for the other, Mr Xi said in his opening remarks. Confrontation has unbearable consequences for both sides. While the meeting on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation (Apec) summit had been highly anticipated, officials on both sides played down expectations of any major breakthroughs. The goals here really are about managing the competition, preventing the downside of risk - of conflict, and ensuring channels of communication are open, a senior US administration official said. Relations deteriorated in February when a suspected Chinese spy balloon was shot down over US airspace. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken visited Beijing in June, making him the highest-ranking Washington official to visit the Chinese capital in almost half a decade. He met President Xi and foreign minister Qin Gang. At the end of his trip, Mr Blinken said that while there were still major issues between the two countries, he hoped they would have better communications and better engagement going forward.

        "title": "Ukraine war: Locals forced to take Russian passports, report says",
        "date": "November 16, 2023 01:37 pm",
        "content": "The Kremlin has launched a wide-ranging campaign to force Ukrainians in occupied territories to become Russian, an investigation has found. Ukrainians are being denied healthcare and free movement unless they take up Russian citizenship, evidence suggests. The European Broadcasting Union (EBU), an alliance of public service media including the BBC, interviewed refugees for the investigation. They spoke of relentless pro-Russian propaganda in the occupied lands. One refugee from the occupied territories, Larysa, told the EBUs Investigative Journalism Network that one of her friends was not provided with insulin for her diabetes - a key part of treatment - until she applied for a Russian passport. Another friend had to become a Russian citizen to have her broken arm treated, Larysa said. She also spoke of other types of pressure forcing Ukrainians to assimilate as Russians. Pensions are not provided without Russian passports, food is not provided without Russian passports, and medical services are out of the question. There are lots of checkpoints on the roads. And every time they stop you, they check your documents, and then say they will not let you through without a Russian passport next time. So people have to obtain these papers. Because if someone, say, has cows in one village and sells milk in another, it is impossible to move between villages. Larysas account of pressure to obtain Russian passports is corroborated by other refugees, such as Lyudmyla (not her real name) from the occupied part of Zaporizhzhia region. When you go to a hospital you need to have a Russian passport. If you do not have a Russian passport, they wont treat you. If you drive your own car and the patrol stops you, and you do not have a Russian passport, they can simply take your car away. So people are forced to obtain them. Retired people are forced to obtain Russian passports to receive pensions. It is a matter of survival. In the past, Russia handed passports to residents of the breakaway Georgian regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, and later used them as part of its justification for invading Georgia in 2008. Russian curriculum But Lyudmyla and her friend Oksana (also not her real name) say the main reason why they left their homes was because their children were being forced to study the Russian school curriculum. We were provoked into leaving by the opening of a Russian school, and we were being forced to go there. They told us that if we did not let our children go there, they would take our children away and deprive us of our parental rights. When you send your children to the school, you must have a Russian passport. If you do not have a Russian passport your child will have problems and you will have problems. What kind of problems? You will be stripped of your parental rights. They will take our children away and thats it - you will be left without children, Lyudmyla says. Earlier in 2023, Russia unveiled new schoolbooks which aim to justify its invasion of Ukraine. They falsely portray Ukraine as an aggressive state run by nationalist extremists and manipulated by the West, which allegedly uses the country as a battering ram against Russia. Oksana says she left also because she was afraid that her 20-year-old son would be drafted into the Russian army and forced to fight Ukrainians. Propaganda Historian Artem Petryk was in the southern city of Kherson when it was occupied by Russians between February and November 2022. He described the Russian authorities concerted efforts to influence the hearts and minds of the local population. From the first days of the occupation, they seized control of television and began broadcasting Russian radio. There was a stream of fakery about Ukraine and the West. It glorified the Russian army and the Russian state. And everywhere in the city they put up billboards with portraits of Russian tsars, commanders, and there were slogans saying that Kherson is a city with a Russian history, Russia is here forever, and so on. They tried to impose the Russian identity through the public space. They marked days of the Russian flag, days of Russia, put up billboards and, of course, tried to establish control over school. They introduced the Russian school curriculum, crucially the history course, and tried to impose Russias world view, Mr Petryk says. Larysa describes Russification efforts by the occupying authorities as another weapon used by Russia. This is the same as weapons - not the ones which shoot, but moral ones. Sometimes these moral weapons hurt harder than a machine gun. Because machine guns fire once and its done, but the moral ones oppress you every day. This is very hard, Larysa says.

Sri Lanka obtained 144 votes out of 188 member states voting at the said election, co-securing the 3rd highest vote count from the region, with Bangladesh, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement. The member states of the UNESCO elected 6 members, out of 9 candidates from the Asia-Pacific Region, to the UNESCO Executive Board. The other countries who were elected from the region are Pakistan, Indonesia, Bangladesh, Republic of Korea and Australia. Sri Lanka last served on the Executive Board from 2015 to 2019, it added. The UNESCO contributes to peace and security by promoting international cooperation in education, sciences, culture, communication and information. It also contributes to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals. Sri Lankas membership in UNESCO in 1949, soon after its independence, is demonstrative of the countrys firm commitment to the values and principles upheld by UNESCO to promote collaboration among nations through education, science and culture, in order to further universal respect for justice, the rule of law and fundamental freedoms of the peoples of the world. Since the inception, Sri Lanka has played a significant role and made proactive contribution towards the furtherance of the mandate of the UNESCO. Sri Lanka National Commission for UNESCO is the government arm for implementing the UNESCO Agenda in Sri Lanka, under the guidance of the Ministry of Education. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs together with the Sri Lanka Embassy in Paris and the Ministry of Education is pleased to have spearheaded the successful effort to ensure Sri Lankas election to UNESCO Executive Board, the statement highlighted. It is notable that in the past months, Sri Lanka has been successful in consecutively being elected to 3 UN bodiescommittees: Committee on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW), Committee on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of their Families (CMW), and the UNESCO Executive Board, according to the Foreign Affairs Ministry.",

        "date": "November 16, 2023 04:53 pm",
        "content": "A Sri Lankan court sentenced an Indian fisherman to two years imprisonment on charges of repeated trespassing and poaching in Sri Lankan waters while releasing 21 others who have been arrested with him. This is the first time a Tamil Nadu fisherman has been imprisoned under these provisions, according to fisheries officials at Rameswaram, India. K Nambumurugan, 20, was among the 22 fishermen who sailed in four boats from Rameswaram on October 14. They were apprehended by the Sri Lankan Navy on charges of poaching in the Sri Lankan waters on October 28. Subsequently, the Oorkavalthurai court in Jaffna remanded them in judicial custody and they were lodged in Jaffna prison. When the Indian fishermen appeared before the court after their remand period on Wednesday, judge Gajaneethibalan released 21 fishermen on condition that they should not venture into Sri Lankan waters again while sentencing Nambumurugan to two-years imprisonment. The court also summoned all four boat owners to appear before the court on February 12 next year with the documents related to the boats. Earlier, Nambumurugan was apprehended by Sri Lankan navy on similar charges on April 2, 2022 while he was sailing in a fishing boat. Gajaneethibalan remanded Nambumurugan to judicial custody at that time. Tamil Nadu officials have informed the state government about the judgment. They said the state government is likely to take up the issue with Indias ministry of external affairs for diplomatic intervention with the island nation. The judgement has shocked Rameswaram fishermen, according to Indian media. Source: Times of India --Agencies",

        "content": "State Minister of Finance Ranjith Siyamabalapitiya says that if the 2024 Budget presented to the parliament by the government is somehow defeated, it will only be a step backwards for Sri Lanka, and warned that it could possibly lead to another Aragalaya struggle in the country. Responding to questions raised by the media when the State Minister visited the Orugodawatta Customs Inspection Terminal this afternoon (16 Nov.), Siyambalapitiya stated that he personally does not believe that any MP in the Parliament wants that to happen again. The State Minister also commented on the debate that arose in Parliament concerning the legitimacy of the Budget deficit. While acknowledging the fact that, as stated in the Fiscal Management (Responsibility) Act No. 03 of 2003, the budget deficit is prohibited from exceeding 5, Siyambalapitiya highlighted the fact that, for the last 20 years, no government has been able to act in accordance with the said clause and maintain the budget deficit at this rate. Thus, the State Minister of Finance notes that it was unfair to expect this of the 2024 Budget, which is being presented amidst one of the most severe and unprecedented economic crises that Sri Lanka has ever faced.",

The Education Minister also noted that new constructions are set to be erected in Thurstan College, Colombo and the Tangalle Balika Vidyalaya, after dilapidated buildings were identified within their premises. Commenting further in this regard, Minister Premajayantha noted that the reason behind there being so many dilapidated buildings in schools was because the government stopped funding the construction of new school buildings and the maintenance of those already existing in 2019. The Ministers parliamentary speech comes on the heels of an incident reported from a school in Wellampitiya, where a 6-year-old child was killed and several others were left injured after a school wall collapsed on Wednesday (15).",

        "date": "November 16, 2023 09:14 pm",
        "content": "Emphasising the importance of expanding language knowledge beyond Sinhala and Tamil languages, President Ranil Wickremesinghe on Thursday (16 Nov.) announced the implementation of the English for All program in all schools and universities across the country by 2030. Addressing the 10th commemoration of the late Mr. R.I.T. Alles, a renowned educationist and founder of D.S. Senanayake College in Colombo, held at the Bandaranaike International Conference Hall in Colombo today, the President also launched the autobiography of Mr. Alles titled My Life. Addressing the governments efforts to reform the education sector in Sri Lanka, President Wickremesinghe highlighted the commitment to realize Mr. R.I.T. Alless vision of Education for all. He stressed the end of students losing opportunities for higher education due to financial constraints and advocated for discontinuing the practice of selling property to send children abroad. President Wickremesinghe outlined plans to establish new universities in both the public and private sectors to ensure access to higher education for all students in Sri Lanka. He assured government support for those in the private sector contributing to this initiative. Additionally, the President invited the Sinhala and Tamil Diasporas to return to Sri Lanka and participate in establishing new universities, as a means of supporting education for the countrys children, emphasizing a shared responsibility for the nations progress. The President further said; Every parent in our country aspires to provide quality education to their children. This education should extend beyond Sinhala and Tamil, encompassing languages like English, Japanese, Chinese, Arabic and Korean. We are focusing on implementing the English for All program by 2030, with an emphasis on imparting English knowledge to both school and university students. Recognizing the need for attention to our higher education system, despite the existence of a supposedly free education system, many individuals pursue education abroad. We aim to adopt successful education systems from around the world. Contrary to the misconception that free education means providing money for universities, in other countries, students receive concessional loans and financial aid to choose their preferred universities. In our country, the University Grants Commission makes the selection. But we must ensure opportunities for students without compromising on the quality of higher education. Our goal is to increase the number of universities and elevate the standards of existing ones within the next five years. Additionally, we plan to establish three technology universities similar to General Sir John Kotelawala University. We encourage the establishment of non-government universities and invite individuals like Dr. Harsha Alles to leverage their experience in starting new universities. To alleviate the financial burden on students, we offer concessional loans, eliminating the need to sell land or send children abroad for higher education. The growing number of universities in our country is attracting students from foreign countries. To the Tamil and Sinhala Diasporas, we extend an invitation to return to Sri Lanka and participate in establishing new universities, as a means of supporting education for the countrys children, emphasizing a shared responsibility for the nations progress. Mr. Alas has set an example in this regard. Education is a right for everyone in our country, and the government is committed to supporting those in the private sector who contribute to this noble cause. Prime Minister Dinesh Gunawardena: I am delighted to be part of this occasion as we reminisce about meeting the exemplary figure from Royal College 60 years ago, who also happens to be our teacher  Mr. R.I.T. Alles. His life serves as a model for all of us, showcasing a remarkable journey that has left an indelible mark on the field of education in our country. Mr. Alles can rightfully be hailed as an educator who ushered in a revolutionary change. Under his guidance, the school evolved into a hub for nurturing exemplary citizens and he exhibited pioneering leadership in the education sector. Not only did Mr. Alles make a significant impact at Royal College, but he also founded D.S. Senanayake College, redirecting the path of childrens education onto a new trajectory. His profound knowledge in education and administration became evident as we engaged with him not only in the classroom but also in various extracurricular activities of the school. My close association with Mr. Alles, particularly during his tenure overseeing the cadets, provided us with invaluable discipline and training, lessons that have continued to strengthen us in life. He consistently emphasized the significance of respecting the teaching profession. Mr. Alles was forward-thinking, consistently striving to align education with the evolving world. His life example stands as a beacon for the principals appointed today, offering invaluable guidance for their professional journeys. The contributions made by Mr. Alles to the field of education will undoubtedly benefit several more generations to come. Minister of Education Dr. Susil Premajayantha: As of today, D.S. Senanayake Vidyalaya, under the visionary leadership of Mr. Alles, accommodates approximately 6,000 students across 157 classrooms from grades 1 to 13, all of which have been transformed into friendly classrooms with government funding. The entire school is equipped with Wi-Fi, reflecting a commitment to embracing technology for education. Addressing the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic and the five-year scholarship exam, a focus has been placed on the crisis in primary education. The aim is to streamline the educational process, ensuring that our childrens education remains in step with the technological advancements shaping the world. Efforts have been made to mitigate delays in education. All textbooks for the year 2024 have been printed, and the first batch of uniforms is set to be received before the end of next month. Additionally, plans are underway to provide lunch to every student. In collaboration with UNESCO, coupons are being distributed for the production of school shoes for 800,000 children, supported not only by government funds but also aid from the French Government over the next four years. This comprehensive approach, coupled with the presence of notable figures such as Leader of the Opposition Sajith Premadasa, Minister of Education Susil Premajayantha, Minister Tiran Alles, Presidential Senior Adviser on National Security and Chief of Presidential Staff Sagala Ratnayaka, MP Udaya Gammanpila, and Presidents Secretary Saman Ekanayake, signals a concerted effort to revolutionize the education system in the country. The event saw the participation of Dr. Harsha Alles, family members, principals, school students and special guests, emphasizing the collective commitment to advancing education.",

        "title": "Sri Lankas former govt sabotaged probe into Easter Sunday bombings, ex-Senior DIG alleges",
        "date": "November 16, 2023 11:29 pm",
        "content": "A retired Senior DIG of Sri Lanka Police has shed new light on claims that the former Sri Lankan government officials may have colluded with a terrorist group for political gain, resulting in the deaths of hundreds of people, including Australians, in the 2019 Easter Sunday bombings, ABC News reported. The attacks by Islamic state-inspired terrorists on churches and luxury hotels killed 269 people including two Australians and injured about 500 other people. The head of the Catholic Church in Sri Lanka is now calling on the Australian government to support an independent investigation into the allegations. In September, the UKs Channel 4 aired claims by a former government aide, Asad Maulana, that a top intelligence official met with members of the terrorist group National Thowheed Jamath (NTJ) as part of an alleged plot to help former Sri Lankan president Gotabaya Rajapaksa win government by creating a national security crisis from the attacks. Now, the former head of the investigation into the bombings has spoken out for the first time about what he claims was political interference which derailed the police probe. Former senior deputy inspector general of police Ravi Seneviratne said his team was taken off the case when Rajapaksa took office six months after the bombings. Seneviratne told the Australian media networks ABC Investigations that his lead investigator was removed without explanation immediately after the new government was elected  at the time, not even a prime minister or the cabinet had been appointed. He said over the months that followed, 22 more officers were removed from the investigation, but I was not given any reason for any of those transfers. The incoming government also imposed an overseas travel ban on more than 700 Criminal Investigation Department officers under Seneviratnes command, the report said. Seneviratne told ABC that this was seen as a bid to intimidate police who might investigate allies of the Rajapaksa regime. This was quite illegal, he said in this regard. Police charged more than 90 people in connection with the Easter Sunday attacks, but Seneviratne told ABC that investigators hit roadblocks when they found some intelligence officers had links with the Muslim group. One of these was unearthed with help from the US Federal Bureau of Investigation, which traced regular communications with the NTJ terrorists to an Internet Protocol address used by a secret military intelligence operative, ABC reported. Seneviratne also claimed that military intelligence officers visited the house of one suicide bomber on the morning of the attacks but did not share this information with police. On such occasions, when we tried to question certain individuals and groups, we faced some obstacles, Seneviratne said. Sri Lankan intelligence agencies twice stopped police from questioning associates of the suicide bombers on the grounds they were involved in national security operations, he said. As military intelligence informed us that those officers were dealing with intelligence related secret matters, we didnt investigate them further. Wrong information concealed terror groups role in earlier killing, former commander says Seneviratne said military intelligence had thwarted an earlier investigation which he believed could have prevented the Easter Sunday attacks. He said military intelligence had given police wrong information which concealed the role of the NTJ in the murder of two constables in east Sri Lanka six months before the Easter Sunday attacks. In documents filed in the Supreme Court of Sri Lanka last year, Seneviratne alleged the Directorate of Military Intelligence and the Security Intelligence Service were suspected to have conspired to plant evidence to mislead CID investigations on the murder of two police officers to prevent them from discovering the real assailants. Seneviratne told ABC Investigations that he believed there was a possibility to prevent the Easter Sunday attacks, if we were able to find out the suspects of the police murders. In September, Asad Maulana, a former aide to a current Sri Lankan government minister, told Channel 4s Dispatches program that he witnessed a meeting between the NTJ terrorists and then head of military intelligence, Suresh Salley in February 2018, 14 months before the Easter Sunday bombings. Maulana claimed to Channel 4 that the intelligence chief later told him Rajapaksa needed an unsafe situation to win an election. Seneviratne said Maulanas claims demanded a thorough investigation, including into why intelligence officers misled police about NTJ. Maulanas former boss, the State Roads Minister Sivanesathurai Chandrakanthan, has accused him of concocting the allegations to bolster his claim for asylum overseas. Rajapaksa, who after his ousting last year was sanctioned by Canada for human rights violations during Sri Lankas civil war, has dismissed the allegations as absurd. Salley has denied any contact with the NTJ terrorists, saying he was overseas at the time of their alleged meeting. He is now the head of Sri Lankas Security Intelligence Service, a role that saw him meet Australian officials including Home Affairs Minister Clare ONeil last year. Neither Rajapaksa nor Salley, however, responded to ABC interview requests or questions. Last month, Channel 4 declined to appear before a commission of inquiry launched by current Sri Lankan President Ranil Wickremesinghe, citing a need to protect confidential sources. The head of the Catholic church in Sri Lanka, Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith, called on the Australian government to help build international pressure for an independent investigation to help us to find out what really happened to these 270 people and who was behind it. We want the Australian government, and also many governments in the world, to consider this as a serious human rights violation, violation of the dignity of human beings and serious suspicions of a political plot appearing, he said. He said in Sri Lanka, big people, ministers  those who are in the intelligence services, had some role to play in the general mayhem that existed during the wartime: disappearances, murders during the war time, and then subsequently. Cardinal Ranjith said one of his priests was being sued for defamation by Suresh Salley, after raising questions about the Easter Sunday attacks and what he said appeared to be a political plot by a group of people at the top. Other priests  have been under surveillance of these people. I am sure they are having files about many of us, even myself, Im quite sure of that, because our telephones are not safe anymore for us to converse freely, he told ABC. Source - ABC - Agencies",

        "date": "November 17, 2023 09:41 am",
        "content": "Israeli soldiers found a tunnel shaft used by Hamas militants at Gazas Al Shifa hospital, the army said, while the U.N. voiced concern no aid would be delivered to Palestinians on Friday via the Rafah crossing with Egypt. The army released a video it said showed a tunnel entrance in an outdoor area of Al Shifa, Gazas biggest hospital. The video, which Reuters could not immediately verify, showed a deep hole in the ground, littered with and surrounded by concrete and wood rubble and sand. It appeared the area had been excavated; a bulldozer appeared in the background. The army said its troops also found a vehicle in the hospital containing a large number of weapons. Hamas said in a statement late on Thursday that claims by the Pentagon and U.S. State Department that the group uses Al Shifa for military purposes is a repetition of a blatantly false narrative, demonstrated by the weak and ridiculous performances of the occupation army spokesman. The United States is confident in an assessment from its own intelligence agencies on Hamas activities in Al Shifa hospital and will neither share nor elaborate on it, White House spokesperson John Kirby said on Thursday. The two telecoms companies in Gaza said all energy sources supplying the network had run out and therefore all services in the territory were down. Israel refuses fuel imports, saying Hamas could use them for military purposes. With communications out and in the absence of fuel, the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, said it was impossible to coordinate humanitarian aid truck convoys. If the fuel does not come in, people will start to die because of the lack of fuel. Exactly as from when, I dont know. But it will be sooner rather than later, said UNRWA Commissioner-General Philippe Lazzarini. As of late Thursday night, there was no further word from the companies, Paltel and Jawwal, whose internet, mobile phone and landline networks remained inoperable. Palestinian civilians have borne the brunt of Israels weeks-long military campaign in retaliation for an Oct. 7 attack by Hamas that Israel says killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians. Gaza health authorities deemed reliable by the United Nations say at least 11,500 people have been confirmed killed in an Israeli bombardment and ground invasion - more than 4,700 of them children. The Israeli militarys chief of staff said Israel was close to destroying Hamas military system in the northern Gaza Strip and there were signs the army was taking its campaign to other parts of the enclave of 2.3 million people. Israel distributed pamphlets telling civilians to leave four towns in southern Gaza, areas Gazans had been previously told would be safe. Gaza hospitals at crux of global deabte Israeli officials said Hamas held some of the 240 hostages taken by gunmen on Oct. 7 in the hospital complex. The body of a woman hostage was recovered by troops in a building near Al Shifa on Thursday, the army said. Military equipment including Kalashnikov rifles and rocket-propelled grenades were also found in the building, it said. Human Rights Watch said hospitals have special protections under international humanitarian law. Hospitals only lose those protections if it can be shown that harmful acts have been carried out from the premises, the watchdogs U.N. Director Louis Charbonneau said. EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell, on his first visit to Israel since the Oct. 7 Hamas attack, called on Israel to do more to protect civilians in Gaza. I understand your rage but let me ask you not to be consumed by rage, Borrell said. Israeli Foreign Minister Eli Cohen said Hamas was to blame not only for the Oct. 7 attack but also for the current plight of Palestinians in Gaza.

        "content": "The Court of Appeal has ordered the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) not to arrest Pastor Jerome Fernando upon his arrival at the Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) in Katunayake. The ruling also mentioned the self-styled prophet should record a statement with the CIDs Cyber Crime Investigation Division within 48 hours of his arrival on the island. This interim order was issued in respect of the petition filed by Pastor Fernando, seeking to prevent the CID from arresting him. It was taken up before Appeals Court President, Justice Nissanka Bandula Karunaratne and Justice Chamath Morais this morning (Nov.17). The judge bench mentioned that after the statement is obtained, standard legal action could be taken against Pastor Fernando. The self-styled prophet found himself in hot water after a video of a sermon delivered by him was widely circulated on social media, stirring much controversy in the country, due to allegations that it included derogatory statements related to Lord Buddha and other religious figures. Subsequently, President Ranil Wickremesinghe had ordered the CID to launch an immediate investigation into the matter, citing that such statements could create religious conflicts and harm the countrys harmony. However, Pastor Fernando flew out to Singapore two days before the Colombo Fort Magistrates Court banned his foreign travels. However, the police had said Pastor Fernando could be arrested upon his return to the island. On May 26, Fernando had filed an FR petition before the court, through his attorneys, seeking an order preventing his arrest. The Inspector-General of Police (IGP), the DIG in charge of the CID, the CID director and the Officer-in-Charge (OIC) of the cybercrimes unit of the CID had been named as the respondents of the FR petition. In his petition, the Pastor deemed the CIDs attempts to arrest him unlawful, claiming that the police had not presented any piece of evidence to the court to prove that his comments threatened religious harmony in the country.",

        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe has authorized the Cabinet sub-committee to discuss the Sri Lankan cricket issue with the International Cricket Council (ICC), Minister Kanchana Wijesekera says. Addressing the parliamentary session this morning (Nov.17), the lawmaker said the ministerial sub-committee has thus requested a meeting with the ICC officials. As the cricket ordeal continued to snowball, President Ranil Wickremesinghe, on November 06, established a Cabinet sub-committee to look into the gazette notification issued by Sports Minister Roshan Ranasinghe appointing an Interim Committee for Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) and suspending the existing cricket governing body. The sub-committee, spearheaded by Minister Ali Sabry, comprises Ministers Tiran Alles, Manusha Nanayakkara and Kanchana Wijesekera. The ministers seven-member Interim Committee for SLC was chaired by World Cup-winning former Sri Lanka captain Arjuna Ranatunga. However, as the President had not been notified of the sports ministers move beforehand. Thus, the ministerial sub-committee was appointed to look into the matter, with the consent of the Sports Minister and the President. Just a day after the interim committee was formed, the Appeals Court put in place a 14-day stay order preventing the operations of the panel, after considering a writ petition filed by SLC president Shammi Silva. This paved way for the ousted president to return to the cricket board. Later, the sports minister challenged the stay-order through a motion filed before the Appeals Court. Thus far, three judges including the Appeals Court president, Justice Nissanka Bandula Karunaratne have recused themselves from consideration of the motion. On November 10, the ICC suspended SLCs membership with immediate effect, on the grounds that it failed to manage its affairs autonomously and ensure that there was no government interference in the governance, regulation andor administration of cricket in Sri Lanka. Later, the President authorized the Cabinet sub-committee to make decisions pertaining to the ICCs suspension of SLCs membership and lifting the temporary ban.",

        "content": "Committee on Public Enterprises (COPE) will not convene meetings until further notice, Speaker of Parliament Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena informed the House today (Nov.17). As such, the COPE meeting scheduled to be held at 1:00 p.m. today has been postponed. The Speaker revealed this in response to a question raised by Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa during Day 4 of the ongoing debate on the Second Reading of 2024 Appropriation Bill (78th Budget Speech). COPE chairman Prof. Ranjith Bandara came under fire for his conduct at the latest committee meeting for which the officials of Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) were summoned for inquiries. Later, the presence of Prof. Bandaras son, Kanishka Bandara at the said meeting also became a controversy. However, the COPE chairman defended his actions in a clarification issued, saying that his son serves as his coordinating secretary. Prof. Bandara said his son was permitted to attend the meeting by the assistant sergeant-at-arms at his request. However, the Speaker told the parliament on Thursday (Nov.16) that an investigation would be conducted into the matter. In addition, the COPE chairman also found himself in hot water after the Opposition Leader revealed some documents in parliament, evidencing that Prof. Bandara served as a consultant for SLC on the Kandy Cricket Campus project, apart from another consultancy firm owned by him which provides services to the cricket body. The Opposition Leader hit out at Prof. Bandara for not disclosing his connection to SLC beforehand and continuing to act as the COPE chairman despite this possible conflict of interest. In a clarification, the SLC said Prof. Bandara does not have any connections to the current administration of the cricket body as his services were obtained from 2017 to 2018 when Thilanga Sumathipala was in office as the SLC president. In the wake of the controversy concerning his hand gesture made during the COPE meeting with SLC officials, Prof. Bandara explained that this was just a tactical maneuver to manage a challenging situation as multiple participants were trying to speak simultaneously.",

        "date": "November 17, 2023 12:36 pm",
        "content": "The body of Yehudit Weiss, one of about 240 people taken captive by Hamas during its October 7 attacks, has been recovered, Israels military has said. Weiss, a 65-year-old mother of five, was found by Israeli soldiers in a structure adjacent to the al-Shifa Hospital, military officials said on Thursday. Yehudit was murdered by the terrorists in the Gaza Strip, and we didnt manage to reach her in time, Israeli military spokesman Daniel Hagari told a televised briefing. Weiss was taken from Kibbutz Beeri on October 7 when Hamas fighters stormed into southern Israel in the largest attack on the country in decades. Weiss husband, Shmulik Weiss, was killed in their home during the attack, according to Israeli officials. Bring Them Home Now, a support group for the captives and their families, described Weiss as a loving full-time grandmother who had a love of travelling, baking and sports. The group said she had been recovering from breast cancer at the time of her capture. Israeli officials said military equipment including Kalashnikov rifles and RPGs were found in the same location as Weisss body. The announcement came as Israeli forces continued to undertake a major military operation at al-Shifa Hospital, the biggest medical facility in Gaza, amid growing concern for the welfare of patients and staff inside and duelling narratives about the complexs role in the war. Israel has claimed that the hospital has been used as a Hamas command centre, and on Thursday released a video showing images of a cache of weapons and a hole in the ground surrounded by rubble. Hamas and hospital officials have denied Israeli claims that the complex has been used to plan and carry out military operations. Hamas official Bassem Naim described the claims as a farce and said the group did not rule out the possibility that Israeli soldiers had planted the weapons themselves. Ashraf al-Qudra, a spokesman for the Health Ministry in Gaza, on Thursday warned that thousands of women, children, sick and wounded were at risk of death at the hospital as Israeli forces continued to occupy the complex.

        "date": "November 17, 2023 01:04 pm",
        "content": "Sri Lankas central bank chief said the government has shared the terms of a 4.2 billion China debt deal with other creditors  a key sticking point with countries like India  paving the way for more loans from the International Monetary Fund. Governor Nandalal Weerasinghe said he hopes the official creditors committee, which is led by Japan, India and the Paris Club of nations, will now propose an agreement to restructure Sri Lankas debt. He expects that will allow the IMF to approve a payout of 330 million before the end of the year, he said in an interview in Colombo on Thursday. Sri Lankas recent debt deal with Export-Import Bank of China caught the IMF and creditor nations like India by surprise, with some officials raising concerns about the lack of transparency over the agreement. China, which is Sri Lankas biggest bilateral lender, isnt part of the official creditors committee. Weerasinghe, 62, said details of the China agreement have now been shared with the creditor committee and the IMF. We hope the official creditors will also respond with their support so that we can go ahead with the IMFs funding program, he said. He didnt disclose the terms of the China deal in the interview. Sri Lanka is trying to reach a debt restructuring agreement with its bilateral creditors and bondholders to allow it to keep receiving funds under a 3 billion bailout package with the IMF. That would help to further stabilize the economy after the worst crisis in seven decades last year forced the nation to default on its debt for the first time in its history. We are moving in the right direction, Weerasinghe said. Sri Lanka has also received a debt restructuring proposal from a group of dollar bondholders, which didnt get the backing of the government. Weerasinghe said the authorities continue to engage with commercial lenders, who may also be waiting to assess the debt proposal from bilateral creditors. A career central banker, Weerasinghe took office in April 2022 when the economy was in a tailspin, with shortages of everything from fuel and electricity to medicine. Inflation hit a peak of nearly 70 later that year and angry protests forced then-President Gotabaya Rajapaksa to flee the country. Inflation is now down to 1.5, foreign exchange reserves have rebounded to 3.6 billion, and shortages of essentials have eased. Weerasinghe reiterated that the central bank was leaving the exchange rate to market forces while only intervening to smooth volatility and accumulate reserves when the opportunity provided. A 12 surge this year has catapulted the island nations currency to among the top performers globally. Thats a remarkable turnaround from its 45 slide in 2022. Funds from the IMF has also spurred optimism over Sri Lankas fiscal recovery, with the nations dollar bonds returning almost 70. Weerasinghe has played a pivotal role in securing the IMF bailout and been a key figure in the debt negotiations with creditors. Hes also championed a new Central Bank Act that aims to ensure price stability through a flexible inflation targeting regime and independent monetary policy decision-making. The governor also made the following comments in the interview:  Sri Lanka is well in line with targets set out in the IMF program, including building foreign exchange reserves and central bank credit to the government  He would like to see reserves increased to about 3 months of import cover, but may not be as much as the IMF is recommending as the country intends to eventually move toward a fully floating exchange rate  Monetary policy transmission would speed up, and the gap between policy and market rates would narrow, once uncertainties over the debt restructuring are cleared Source: Bloomberg --Agencies",

Accordingly, the chief cricket selector is slated to appear before the SIU on November 22. Summons were issued after Sports Minister Roshan Ranasinghe asked the SIU on Thursday (Nov.16) to investigate the matter. On November 14, Wickramasinghe issued a controversial statement, alleging that the adversities Sri Lankan cricket is facing at present were the result of multifaceted conspiratorial plans that had been in operation at various levels over the past two and a half years. Expressing his views on the plight of the sport in the country, Wickramasinghe said the suspension imposed on Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) by the International Cricket Council (ICC) was also a consequence of this scheme. Behind this conspiracy, he said were certain individuals who were vying for power in the cricket governing body, brokers involved in match-fixing, and the players who were trying hard to secure their spot in the national team. The ultimate goal was to cause the downfall of the cricket administration. Wickramasinghe went on to dismiss the criticisms levelled against the national cricket selection committee over the past two and a half years, as untrue and destructive. In August, the Minister of Sports and Youth Affairs had appointed a Special Investigation Unit under the Prevention of Offences Relating to Sports Act, headed by Assistant Superintendent of Police W.A. Jayanath Wanasinghe. It had been established for the practical execution of the legal provisions of the Act, and proceed in line with the powers and functions assigned by the Prevention of Offences relating to Sports Act.",

Jayasekara, who was the former General Secretary of the SLFP, had sought an order for the revocation of the decisions taken by the party to oust him from the position he held within the party and ask him for excuses. Western Province Civil Appellate High Court Judges Priyantha Fernando and Frank Gunawardena decided to dismiss Jayasekaras request after considering the facts presented by Presidents Counsel Faiszer Musthapha, who appeared on behalf of the respondents of the case including the SLFP Chairman and former President Maithripala Sirisena. Meanwhile, the Presidents Counsel also argued that asking for excuses from Jayasekara is legal since it has been carried out under the approval of the executive council of the SLFP. Jayasekara first filed a complaint before the Colombo District Court, challenging the decision taken by the SLFP to expel him as the partys General Secretary and a letter directed by the partys chairman Maithripala Sirisena which mentioned that a disciplinary inquiry would be conducted against Jayasekara and asked him to provide excuses to defend himself. The Colombo District Court which took the case into consideration, refused to issue injunctions regarding the matter.

Dr. Muizzu won the Maldivian presidential election in September, beating incumbent Ibrahim Solih in a second-round runoff.

        "date": "November 17, 2023 09:06 pm",
        "content": "The Unit 2 generator of Lakvijaya Power Plant in Norochcholai will remain inoperative from tonight (Nov.17), the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) says. According to the state-owned utility, the high-pressure heater system of the generating unit has suffered an emergency breakdown. The CEB said the power plants employees have already initiated the preliminary measures to restore the out-of-order generating unit. Meanwhile, Unit 3 of the Norochcholai power plant, which remained deactivated since June 2023, has completed the scheduled major overhaul maintenance work and is now undergoing a test run. On that account, this generating unit is expected to be connected to the national grid as soon as possible, the CEB said further, assuring that the generation of electricity would not be hampered by the prevailing situation. Meanwhile, the Kelanitissa Combined Cycle Power Station, which generates 165MW of electricity and operates on naphtha fuel, has been shut down from today for scheduled maintenance of both its Gas Turbine and Steam Turbine, the CEB added.",
