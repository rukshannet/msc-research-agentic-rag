        "title": "Seven people shot dead at a synagogue in Jerusalem",
        "date": "January 28, 2023 09:05 am",
        "content": "Seven people have been shot dead at a synagogue in East Jerusalem, the most killed in an attack of this kind for years. At least three more people were injured. The incident happened in the citys Neve Yaakov neighbourhood at about 20:15 local time (18:15 GMT). Police described the attacker as a terrorist and said he had been neutralised. Local media identified him as a Palestinian man from East Jerusalem. Speaking at the scene, Israeli police commissioner Kobi Shabtai called it one of the worst attacks we have encountered in recent years. Israeli worshippers had gathered for prayers at the start of the Jewish Sabbath in a synagogue in the Jewish settlement and were leaving when the gunman opened fire. Police say that officers then shot him dead. Forensic teams are investigating a white car that appears to have been driven by the gunman. Palestinian militant groups praised the attack, but did not say one of their members was responsible. The attack was celebrated by Palestinians in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip with rallies and the handing out of sweets. The attack happened on Holocaust Memorial Day, which commemorates the six million Jews and other victims who were killed in the Holocaust by the Nazi regime in Germany. To attack worshippers at a synagogue on Holocaust Memorial Day, and during Shabbat, is horrific. We stand with our Israeli friends, British Foreign Secretary James Cleverly wrote on Twitter. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said: The United States condemns in the strongest terms the horrific terrorist attack. President Joe Biden talked with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and offered all appropriate means of support, the White House said. Shortly after the incident, Mr Netanyahu visited the site, as did the controversial far-right National Security Minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir. Mr Ben-Gvir promised to bring safety back to Israels streets but there is rising anger that he has not yet done so, says the BBCs Yolande Knell in Jerusalem. Tensions have been high since nine Palestinians - both militants and civilians - were killed during an Israeli military raid in Jenin in the occupied West Bank on Thursday. This was followed by rocket fire into Israel from Gaza, to which Israel responded with air strikes. United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres is deeply worried about the current escalation of violence in Israel and the occupied Palestinian territory, a spokesperson said. This is the moment to exercise utmost restraint, said Stephane Dujarric. Israel has occupied East Jerusalem since the 1967 Middle East war and considers the entire city its capital, though this is not recognised by the vast majority of the international community. Palestinians claim East Jerusalem as the future capital of a hoped-for independent state. Source: BBC -Agencies",

        "date": "January 28, 2023 09:33 am",
        "content": "The Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL) has refused to approve the demand management program by Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB). The electricity sector regulator said the demand management schedule violates and affects the rights of more than 331,000 candidates sitting for the 2022 G.C.E. Advanced Level examination. This announcement comes in the background of PUCSLs earlier notice to CEB that requests for power cuts would not be green-lighted until 17 February 2023. In a letter directed to CEBs additional general manager on Friday (Jan 27), PUCSL chairman Janaka Ratnayake explained the decision was taken with the intention of safeguarding the human rights of the AL examination candidates. In its letter, Ratnayake went on to note that the PUCSL granted the approval for all requests made by the transmission licensee for scheduled power interruptions made from February 18, 2022 to January 25, 2023 under Condition 30(10) of Electricity Transmission and Bulk Supply License No. ELT09-002. Meanwhile, the officials, who participated in the recent discussion with the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka (HRCSL) with regard to the uninterrupted supply of electricity during the AL examination, have vowed legal action against the officials of the rights body, alleging that they were coerced into signing certain documents. Speaking on the matter, Minister of Power  Energy Kanchana Wijesekera stated that President Ranil Wickremesinghe too has been informed of the incident. Wijesekera said he was informed by the ministerial secretary of the incident in which the officials in question, who had taken part in the discussion, had been pressurized into signing two documents by two officials of the HRCSL, after having been threatened with jail sentences. On Wednesday evening (25 Jan.), the HRCSL convened an urgent meeting with the top officials of the CEB, the Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL) ,the Ministry of Power  Energy and the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC), during which an agreement was reached not to impose power cuts during this period in order to minimize the inconvenience caused to the students sitting for the exam. In response, the HRCSL has filed a defamation complaint against these claims. The complaint was also filed on the grounds of neglect, a statement issued by the HRCSL read, as scheduled power cuts of two hours and 20 minutes continued, despite the agreement reached by all parties at the said inquiry to refrain from imposing power cuts while the exam is taking place. The Secretary to the Ministry of Power and Energy, M. P. D. U. K Mapa, Chairman of the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB), M. S. Illangakoon and the Attorney General have been named as respondents in the complaint. Against this backdrop, the PUCSL has asked the members of the public to inform the commission in writing of any unauthorized power cuts imposed by the CEB. Electricity consumers are urged to file complaints in this regard via the PUCSLs hotline - 077 568 7387 (or WhatsApp), email - consumerspucsl.gov.lk and fax - 011 2 392 641.",

Further, when asked about recent claims that the Opposition may be stronger, Rajapaksa asserted that these claims were only made by some persons, while the majority believes that the SLPPP is likely the stronger party. When asked about the potential of a presidential election being held, Rajapaksa once again asserted that the SLPP is ready for any election.",

        "date": "January 28, 2023 03:45 pm",
        "content": "The Chairman of the Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL) today dismissed the claims of the Secretary to the Ministry of Power  Energy that the officials who participated in the recent discussion with the Human Rights Commission (HRCSL) were coerced into agreeing to an uninterrupted supply of electricity until the end of the ongoing 2022 Advanced Level examination. Calling a special media briefing today (Jan. 28), Janaka Ratnayake attributed the uninterrupted supply of power to the arbitrary conduct of the Power  Energy Minister who is unwilling to change his stance on the matter. Ratnayake, who noted that no official was coerced at the HRCSL meeting, explained that the officials were only briefed about the legal background pertaining to the situation. He also took issue with an Additional Secretary to the Power  Energy Ministry making an appearance at the HRCSL when the secretary himself had been summoned to the meeting. The PUCSL chief vowed to seek legal action against the CEB in the coming 2-3 days, if it fails to comply with the directives despite being instructed to provide an uninterrupted supply of electricity until February 17. Legal action will be sought pursuant to Article 48 of Sri Lanka Electricity Act No. 20 of 2009, headed. The electricity sector regulator is of the view that the power interruptions should not take place until the conclusion of the exam, Ratnayake stressed, adding that the PUCSL has rejected the CEBs request for power cuts to be imposed today as well. He slammed the move to impose power cuts during the period in which the exam is being held as a violation of the rights of the students. It is the responsibility of the government to provide the candidates with the necessary facilities during the exam. Ratnayake also mentioned that the PUCSL has reached out to the Attorney General to obtain his legal opinion with regard to the proposed electricity tariff revision. Accordingly, the Attorney Generals advice on the matter is expected to be received on Monday, he added, noting that the proposed tariff revision is against the provisions of the Electricity Act.",

        "date": "January 28, 2023 04:12 pm",
        "content": "Hollywoods film academy said on Friday it was reviewing this years campaigns for Oscar nominations, a day after a media report raised questions about the surprise nod for British actress Andrea Riseborough. On Tuesday, Riseborough was nominated for best actress for playing an alcoholic single mother in little-seen film To Leslie, a shock to awards pundits who had not expected her to be in the mix. Media newsletter Puck reported on Thursday that the unexpected nomination had sparked questions about whether an aggressive campaign for Riseborough had violated lobbying rules set by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. The academy issued a statement on Friday that said the organization was conducting a review of the campaign procedures around this years nominees, to ensure that no guidelines were violated. The statement did not name Riseborough. The review also aims to inform us whether changes to the guidelines may be needed in a new era of social media and digital communication, the statement said. The academy limits how studios can reach out to voters, how often and what they can say in any communications as part of their Oscars campaigns. Puck reported that the wife of the film director, actress Mary McCormack, and friends had emailed and called tons of members of the Academys actors branch, begging them to see the little-watched alcoholic drama and post online about Riseboroughs searing performance. Dozens of A-list stars then sang her praises and helped win her the coveted nomination, Puck said. Representatives for McCormack and Riseborough did not immediately respond to requests for comment. To Leslie has collected 27,000 at movie box offices since its release in October, according to Box Office Mojo. We have confidence in the integrity of our nomination and voting procedures, and support genuine grassroots campaigns for outstanding performances, the academy statement said. Winners of the Academy Awards will be announced on March 12. Source: Reuters -Agencies",

        "content": "Two Indian Air Force fighter jets have crashed after an apparent midair collision while on exercises about 300km (185 miles) south of the capital, New Delhi. Both aircraft had taken off on Saturday morning from the Gwalior airbase, about 50km (30 miles) east of where they came down. We have located the wreckage of one of the planes and found an injured pilot in the Pahadgarh forests, officer Dharmender Gaur told AFP news agency. The other plane has likely fallen further away from the site and we have sent teams to locate it. Meanwhile, local administrator Ankit Asthana told Reuters news agency two of the three crew members from one jet were rescued and rushed to hospital. The status of the third crew member was not immediately clear, and no details were released on the crew of the second plane. The aircraft that crashed in Indias Madhya Pradesh state were a Sukhoi-30 and a Mirage 2000, ANI news agency said in a tweet, citing defence sources. Saturdays is the latest in a string of aviation accidents involving Indias military air fleet. Five army soldiers were killed last October when their helicopter crashed in Arunachal Pradesh state, near the countrys militarised and disputed border with China. It was the second military chopper crash in the northeastern state that month, coming weeks after a Cheetah helicopter came down near the town of Tawang, killing its pilot. Indias defence chief, General Bipin Rawat, was among 13 people killed when his Russian-made Mi-17 helicopter crashed while transporting him to an air force base in December 2021.

He attributed the primary cause of the countrys economic crisis to the decrease in government revenue due to the said tax concessions. President Wickremesinghe, who mentioned that the growth rate of the economy is expected to contract by -3.5 or -4 this year from -11 in 2022, pledged to take the countrys economy to positive growth.

        "title": "Tyre Nichols death: Outrage in US after footage of brutal police assault on motorist revealed",
        "date": "January 28, 2023 10:51 pm",
        "content": "Footage of a traffic stop that has seen five ex-Memphis police officers charged with murder shows them kicking and punching a motorist for several minutes as he cries out for his mother. Officers are seen beating Tyre Nichols, 29, in the videos from the 7 January arrest, with no signs of him resisting. US President Joe Biden said he was deeply pained by the horrific clip. Lawyers for Mr Nichols family likened the assault to the 1991 police beating of Los Angeles motorist Rodney King. Peaceful protests took place in Memphis on Friday night after the video was released, with some demonstrators blocking a major highway in the city, while small-scale demonstrations were held elsewhere in the country. Many protesters held banners demanding justice for Mr Nichols and an end to police terror. (This article contains descriptions of violence that some people may find distressing.) Police initially said Mr Nichols had been stopped on suspicion of reckless driving, which has not been substantiated. He died in hospital three days later, on 10 January. Mr Nichols was black, as are all five officers charged in the case. Memphis Police Department released four graphic videos of the traffic stop and its violent aftermath on Friday, totalling more than an hour of footage. The first clip shows officers pulling Mr Nichols out of his vehicle and shouting at him to get on the ground. I didnt do anything! he says. Officers demand that he lie down flat. Get on the expletive ground! one officer shouts, as another is heard saying: Tase him! An officer shouts: Put your hands behind your back before I break your expletive. You guys are really doing a lot right now, Mr Nichols says to the officers. Im just trying to go home. Within seconds one of the officers fires a Taser at Mr Nichols, who leaps up and manages to run away. A separate video, from a CCTV camera mounted on a utility pole, shows officers beating Mr Nichols after catching up with him in a residential area. Two officers are seen holding Mr Nichols down while others take turns kicking and punching him and striking him with an expandable baton. They drag him across the ground and prop him sitting up against a squad car. More than 20 minutes elapse until an ambulance is seen arriving. The third and fourth videos show police body camera footage of the beating, with Mr Nichols being held down, pepper-sprayed and assaulted as he repeatedly shouts: Mom! The videos also show officers milling about recounting details of the incident as Mr Nichols lies slumped against the car. Some of them claim Mr Nichols swung at them or reached for their guns, though neither allegation is clear from the released video. Officers can also be heard saying that nothing was found in his car. Mr Nichols mother, RowVaughn Wells, has said her son was only about 230ft (70m) from home when Memphis police officers murdered him. Representatives of the family have described Mr Nichols as the father of a four-year-old son and a keen skateboarder who had recently enrolled in a photography class. He worked for the FedEx parcel delivery firm. One of the lawyers, Antonio Romanucci, said: This young man, by definition of the law in this state, was terrorised. The video is appalling, Greg Donaldson, a professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York, told the BBC. He said the lack of training stands out, with the police officers anger seeming to grow as their incompetence seems to be more revealed. The worse part of it was the inhumanity after the incident, he added, as officers leave Mr Nichols laying there on the ground like a piece of garbage. The five officers - Tadarrius Bean, Demetrius Haley, Desmond Mills Jr, Emmitt Martin III and Justin Smith - were fired last week. They were taken into custody on Thursday and each faces charges of second-degree murder, aggravated assault, aggravated kidnapping, official misconduct and official oppression. Four of the five posted bail and were released from custody by Friday morning, according to jail records. Lawyers for Mr Martin and Mr Mills have said their clients will plead not guilty. Memphis Police Director Cerelyn Davis described the five officers actions as heinous, reckless and inhumane. With protests anticipated, she told US media that local officials had decided to release the video on Friday evening so that schoolchildren and commuters would have time to get home. Reverend Al Sharpton, who will deliver the eulogy for Mr Nichols on Wednesday, asked protesters to remain non-violent, saying unrest would only help the defendants. In a tweet the civil rights leader said the sad reality was police brutality would be an ever-present threat for Black and Brown Americans unless cops continually see that those who use blunt force will go to jail. The protests around the country have so far been largely peaceful, which Mr Nichols family had called for, saying they didnt want any type of disturbance. One protester at the Memphis rally, 21-year-old Kyrion, told the BBC he had dreamed as a child of joining the citys police force, but now that dream was shattered.Its just wicked, the system is forever going to be wicked, he said. Which is why Im out here today, as of right now I cant count on police to protect me. How do I know the man is not going to put his knee into my neck, or hold me down and beat me into a pulp? After the videos were released, Shelby County Sheriffs Office said two of its deputies had also been relieved from duty pending an investigation into their conduct. Source: BBC -Agencies",

A few showers will occur in Northern, Eastern and Uva provinces, it said. General public is kindly requested to take adequate precautions to minimize damages caused by temporary localized strong winds and lightning during thundershowers. Sea Aeras: The low-pressure area located over the Southeast Bay of Bengalis very likely to move west-northwestwards and intensify into a Depression over the South-West Bay of Bengal Sea area around 31st January 2023. Thereafter, it is likely to move gradually west-northwestwards and reach near east coast of Sri Lanka on 01st February 2023. Wind speeds will be 40-45 kmph and can increase up to 60 kmph in sea areas between (Equator - 05 N) and between (85E  95E).

        "title": "Jaishankars visit reset bilateral relations, says Sri Lankan envoy",
        "date": "January 29, 2023 08:23 am",
        "content": "India and Sri Lanka have been able to address the impact of a Chinese surveillance vessels visit to Hambantota port last year and Colombo is looking to New Delhi to help drive economic recovery through investments in key sectors such as energy, Sri Lankan envoy Milinda Moragoda said. Indian External Affairs Minister S Jaishankars recent visit to Sri Lanka helped reset bilateral relations and both sides have made a fresh start, he said. Defence cooperation, including military-to-military exchanges, too has picked up pace and the two sides are in discussions regarding the supply of another Dornier surveillance aircraft to Sri Lanka, he said in an interview. I think this is a fresh start and its a new chapter. Jaishankars visit was a reset and I think we have lessons to learn. But the biggest success for us was that we kept communication lines open, he said in response to a question on whether the two sides had overcome the fallout of the visit of Chinas Yuan Wang 5 tracking vessel to Hambantota in 2022. We have sort of been able to get over it, but we have to always be vigilant, he added. Expressing appreciation for the economic aid of nearly 4 billion extended by New Delhi without any conditions for Colombo amid last years economic crisis, Moragoda said India had also taken the lead in providing guarantees to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to help Sri Lanka access a 2.9-billion bailout package. In every way, India led the stabilisation and was the bridge to the IMF, he said. The reality is that our social explosion would have been much worse and would have been clearly violent if India had not stepped in. Sri Lanka is keen on Indian investments in key areas, including renewable energy, especially wind and solar energy in the islands northwest, development of the Trincomalee oil tank farm as a regional energy hub, and the Sri Lankan governments planned divestments in telecommunications, insurance and hotels, he said. The framework is being set up for a power grid between the two countries, he added. A subsidiary of Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) signed a deal with Sri Lanka last year to develop the 850-acre oil storage facility at Trincomalee with a capacity of nearly one million tonnes. Moragoda said storage of fuel at the facility will help Sri Lankas energy security and there is also scope for building a refinery with the possible involvement of a third country. The tourism sector is low-hanging fruit. We need tourism to get the economy moving quickly. India was the main source of tourists before the pandemic, he said. The two sides are also looking at expanding trade through Indian rupee settlements. India has allowed Sri Lankan banks to open Indian rupee accounts with Indian banks. RuPay would be another possibility for tourism, he said, adding there was agreement at the policy level on RuPay and technical discussions were on to finalise arrangements. Moragoda, who recently met National Security Adviser Ajit Doval and Chief of Defence Staff Gen Anil Chauhan for discussions on security issues, said defence cooperation between the two sides has picked up pace. Sri Lanka currently has about 400 military personnel being trained in India, the highest for any country, and work is underway on a floating dock being built at Goa shipyard for the Sri Lankan Navy. Following the supply of a Dornier reconnaissance aircraft to Sri Lanka last year, the two sides are in negotiations for a second aircraft. India and Sri Lanka are set to hold their annual bilateral defence dialogue during February 23-25 and there is significant cooperation through the Colombo Security Conclave that brings together India, the Maldives, Sri Lanka and Mauritius, he said. We should build towards a strategic dialogue. At the moment, the strategic dialogue happens at the political level, but over time it could be more structured, he said. Noting that the Yuan Wang 5 episode occurred when there was an element of dysfunctionality in Sri Lanka, Moragoda said the continuing dialogue with India helped build trust. I think we should develop ways of predicting some of these things. There may be other unknowns, may not be a ship. It may be something else, but what is important is an open line of communication, especially in what is essentially an asymmetrical relationship of India and Sri Lanka, he said.

He emphasized that around 2,000 Leprosy patients are being reported in the country per year. Furthermore, Dr. Gajanayake stated that a public awareness programme has been organized centering the Colombo District, in conjunction with World Leprosy Day which falls today (Jan. 29). The doctor also added that since the disease only appears as a white spot for a long time, many people tend to ignore it. Meanwhile, the theme of World Leprosy Day 2023 was announced by the World Health Organization (WHO) as Act Now. End Leprosy. This years theme calls attention to three key messages, according to the WHO. 1. Elimination is possible: We have the power and tools to stop transmission and defeat this disease. 2. Act now: We need the resources and commitment to end leprosy. Prioritize leprosy elimination. 3. Reach the unreached: Leprosy is preventable and treatable. Suffering from leprosy is needless. Leprosy is curable with a combination of antibiotics known as Multi-Drug Therapy (MDT). This treatment is available for free across the world, the WHO mentioned, adding that if Leprosy is not treated, it can lead to serious complications.",

        "content": "A passenger bus crashed into a pillar and fell off a bridge, catching fire and killing 40 people in southern Pakistan on Sunday, a government official said. The bus was carrying 44 passengers from Quetta in Balochistan province to Karachi in neighbouring Sindh province. The accident was near the town of Bela, in Lasbela district. Hamza Anjum Nadeem, assistant commissioner in Bela, said the bodies of 40 people, including women and children, were recovered. Four injured passengers were rescued. The accident happened due to over-speeding and the bus crashed into the pillar of a bridge. It caught fire soon after falling (off the bridge), he said. Images from the crash site showed what was left of the charred bus lying near the bridge. The recovered remains of some of the dead are lined up in rows nearby. Nadeem said the bodies were charred beyond recognition and are being transported to Karachi for DNA sampling. After identification, the bodies will be handed over to the victims relatives. Firefighters and workers from the Lasbela Welfare Trust and the Edhi Welfare Foundation carried out the rescue operation. The chief minister of Balochistan, Mir Abdul Qudoos Bizenjo, expressed his sorrow for the loss of life and ordered authorities to provide the best medical facilities to the injured. Traffic accidents in Pakistan generally happen due to violation of traffic rules, resulting in the deaths of thousands every year. In a separate incident, in Pakistans northwest, at least 10 students who were on a picnic drowned after their boat capsized in a lake on Sunday, police said. The children, from a religious school in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, were visiting a lake at Tanda Dam. Local police official Qismat Khan said 25 students were on the boat. Six were rescued, and three of them are in critical condition. The dead pupils were aged between 11 to 13. Nine children remained missing. Khan said an earlier group of 16 students was able to cross the lake. But the same boat capsized while taking 25 on the next trip. As per initial reports, overloading resulted in the overturning of the boat, he said. Abdul Rauf Qaiserani, the district police officer, reached the scene to oversee the rescue work. Life-saving divers were called in from the provincial capital Peshawar due to an immediate lack of them locally. People from the area joined authorities in recovering bodies from the water. Pakistan has witnessed similar incidents in the past as tourist attractions do not adhere to safety measures, including the use of life vests. Source - The Associated Press -Agencies",

        "date": "January 29, 2023 06:18 pm",
        "content": "MELBOURNE, Australia (AP)  Novak Djokovic found this trip to Australia far less complicated, and far more successful, than that of a year ago. Unable to enter his best event in 2022 after being deported from the country because he was not vaccinated against COVID-19, Djokovic accomplished all he could have wanted in his return: He resumed his winning ways at Melbourne Park and made it back to the top of tennis. Only briefly challenged in the final on Sunday night, Djokovic was simply better at the most crucial moments and beat Stefanos Tsitsipas 6-3, 7-6 (4), 7-6 (5) for a record-extending 10th Australian Open championship and record-tying 22nd Grand Slam title overall. As a bonus, Djokovic will vault from No. 5 to No. 1 in the ATP rankings, a spot he already has held for more weeks than any other man. Hes the greatest that has ever held a tennis racket, Tsitsipas said. Djokovic stretched his unbeaten streak in Melbourne to 28 matches, the longest run at the tournament for a man in the Open era, which dates to 1968. He adds trophy No. 10 there to the seven from Wimbledon, three from the U.S. Open  where he also was absent last year because of no coronavirus shots  and two at the French Open, to match rival Rafael Nadal for the most by a man in tennis history. Margaret Court, with 24, Serena Williams, with 23, and Steffi Graf, with 22, have the most among women. This was also the 93rd ATP tour-level title for Djokovic, allowing the 35-year-old from Serbia to break a tie with Nadal for the fourth-most. Jimmy Connors holds that mark, at 109. Djokovic was participating in his 33rd major final, Tsitsipas in his second  and the 24-year-old from Greeces other one also ended in a loss to Djokovic, at the 2021 French Open. He was superior throughout against Tsitsipas, but especially so in the two tiebreakers. He took a 4-1 lead in the first and after it was 4-all, pulled off three points in a row. He led 5-0 in the closing tiebreaker and, when it finished, he pointed to his temple then climbed into the stands, pumped his fist and jumped with his coach, Goran Ivanisevic, and other members of the entourage, and collapsed, crying. Little doubt this is of no solace to Tsitsipas, but there is no shame in failing to defeat Djokovic in Melbourne. Challenging his dominion on those blue hard courts is every bit the monumental task that taking on Nadal on the red clay at Roland Garros is. Perhaps surprisingly, Tsitsipas was willing to engage in the kind of leg-wearying, lung-searing back-and-forths upon which Djokovic has built his superlative career. How did that work out? Of points lasting at least five strokes, Djokovic won 43, Tsitsipas 30, Then again, on those rare occasions that Tsitsipas did charge the net, he likely regretted the choice, because Djokovic often conjured up a passing shot that was too tough to handle. One of Djokovics many other strengths is his return game, and he accumulated three break points within 17 minutes, converting the last for a quick 3-1 lead when Tsitsipas double-faulted. The trophy for which they were playing was displayed on a pedestal near a corner of the court, and both men would get within reach of it whenever wandering over to towel off between points at that end. So close, yes, but for Tsitsipas, never truly close enough. Its not as though Tsitsipas played all that poorly, other than a rash of early miscues that seemed to be more a product of tension than anything. Its that Djokovic was, put simply, too good. Too accurate with his strokes  making merely 22 unforced errors, 20 fewer than his foe  and anticipation. Too speedy and flexible chasing shots (other than on one second-set point, when, running to his left, Djokovic took a tumble). Too dangerous with his returns and damaging enough with his serves. Djokovic pushes and pushes and pushes some more, until its the opponent who is something less than perfect on one shot, either missing or providing an opening to pounce. There has been more than forehands and backhands on Djokovics mind over the past two weeks. There was the not-so-small matter of last years legal saga  he has alternately acknowledged the whole thing served as a form of motivation but also said the other day, Im over it  and curiosity about the sort of reception he would get. He heard a ton of loud support, but also dealt with some persistent heckling while competing, including applause after the faults Sunday. There was the sore left hamstring that has been heavily bandaged for every match  until the final, that is, when only a single piece of beige athletic tape was visible  and had worried him at the beginning of Week 1, prompting him to turn to what he said was a lot of pain-killing pills and other treatments he didnt detail. And then there was the more complicated matter of his father, Srdjan, being filmed with a group of people with Russian flags  one with an image of Vladimir Putin  after Djokovics quarterfinal victory. The tournament banned spectators from bringing in flags of Russia or Belarus, saying they would cause disruption because of the ongoing invasion of Ukraine. Both Djokovic and his father said it was a misunderstanding, based on Srdjan thinking he was with a group of Serbian fans. Because of that episode, Srdjan Djokovic did not attend his sons semifinal victory over Tommy Paul on Friday, and was not seen in the Djokovic guest box on Sunday. No matter any of it, Djokovic managed to excel as he so often does, winning 17 sets in a row after ceding one in the second round last week. Source: AP --Agencies",

        "content": "Chairman of the Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL), Janaka Rathnayake says that legal action will be initiated from tomorrow (Jan. 30) regarding the officials who have failed to implement a decision given by an independent commission. Speaking at a special press briefing this evening (Jan. 29), Mr. Ratnayake stated that the role of an independent commission is to act independently, and not to implement the decisions of the political authority. He also responded to the accusations levelled by Minister Kanchana Wijesekera at a press conference held today, that he had asked ex-president Gotabaya Rajapaksa for the post of chairman at a private bank. The PUCSL chairman further alleged that the minister has revised the electricity tariffs unfairly in order to obtain the peoples money, by forcing them to make the cabinet decision he needs, without properly managing the situation. The minister has no intention to provide electricity for the students. Thats why he brings up questions one by one, he stressed. Furthermore, Mr. Ratnayake highlighted that he needs only to carry out the duties of the commission independently with no political ties, adding that he receives the required support from the other members of the commission for that purpose. The minister talks about the Ceylon Electricity Board without any data. We are talking based on data, he claimed. This should be done scientifically. Here is the political authority using the arbitrary process violating the childrens rights and leaving it to the PUCSL. The CEB is going to obtain Rs. 100 billion from the people who have been stuck in economic issues, who are using 30-60 units of electricity, Mr. Ratnayake said, mentioning that it is an unfair process. We will proceed with the proposal that we have calculated in a fair manner. We will not give away this to CEB as requested, he emphasized. The PUCSL Chairman further emphasized that the independent commissions are there to properly manage and regulate these matters, but political interferences are being carried out in each and every activity.",

        "date": "January 29, 2023 09:06 pm",
        "content": "In a tragic incident, ten children died when a boat capsized on Sunday in northwest Pakistan, as reported by the news agency AFP. The boat was carrying around 25 to 30 students on a daytrip from a local madrassa when it overturned. All of the dead children so far have been recovered from Tanda Dam lake, near Kohat in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. According to local police official Mir Rauf, the children, who died were between the age of seven and 14-years-old, AFP reported. Rauf said, 11 children were rescued from the water, with six in critical condition. A rescue operation is underway, Rauf told AFP. Mass drownings are common in Pakistan, when aged and overloaded vessels lose their stability and pitch passengers into the water. Many in the country do not know how to swim, particularly women who are discouraged from learning owing to conservative social mores. Their all-covering clothes also weigh them down once they become sodden. Women drowned when an overcrowded boat carrying a wedding party across the Indus river in Punjab province capsized on July 18. In another incident, at least 41 people were killed after a passenger coach fell into a ravine in Pakistans Balochistan on Sunday, Dawn reported citing officials. The incident occurred in the Lasbela district of Balochistan. Lasbela Assistant Commissioner Hamza Anjum has confirmed the incident. Anjum stated that the vehicle carrying 48 passengers was travelling from Quetta to Karachi, as per the Dawn report. He said that the vehicle crashed into the pillar of a bridge near Lasbela and subsequently fell into a ravine and caught fire. Hamza Anjum feared that the number of casualties could rise to 48. According to Hamza Anjum, three people, including a child and a woman have been rescued from the accident site, according to Dawn. One of the injured persons succumbed to his injuries while being taken to hospital. --Agencies",

        "date": "January 29, 2023 10:19 pm",
        "content": "Sri Lankan Minister of Foreign Affairs Ali Sabry has held talks with ministers and senior officials in Saudi Arabia, as the crisis-hit island nation seeks to boost cooperation with the Kingdom and other Gulf countries. Sabry met with his Saudi counterpart Prince Faisal bin Farhan, Secretary-General of Organization of Islamic Cooperation Hissein Brahim Taha, Secretary-General of the Gulf Cooperation Council Nayef Falah M. Al-Hajraf, and CEO of the Saudi Fund for Development Sultan Al-Marshad, as well as officials from the Islamic Development Bank. Sabry said that his visit to the Kingdom was successful and that it will further cement and strengthen the bilateral relationship between our two countries as we see a lot of positive vibes that have been infused into our relations. Talks between the two foreign ministers covered enhancement of bilateral relations, increased investment with Sri Lanka as a gateway to South Asia, and employment for Sri Lankans in the Kingdom. Saudis have identified Sri Lanka as a very important geographical location, so (there are) investment opportunities in renewable energy, petroleum and hospitality industries, Sabry said. We are interested in getting Saudi investment into the renewable energy sector for development, energy security and making Sri Lanka a regional energy hub. Discussions also took place around resuming airline services between Saudi Arabia and Sri Lanka following their suspension during the global pandemic. In a bid to enhance trade and investment relations between both countries, the visiting minister signed a double tax avoidance agreement with the Zakat and Income Tax Authority here to prevent fiscal evasion on income. Sri Lanka is facing its worst economic crisis since independence in 1948, with the government battling a shortage of foreign earnings, runaway inflation and recession. The Sri Lankan minister thanked the Kingdom for its help with debt restructuring at the International Monetary Fund and Paris Club. The Paris Club of creditor nations has proposed a 10-year debt moratorium on Sri Lankan debt and 15 years of debt restructuring as a formula to resolve the island nations currency crisis. Sri Lanka is also in discussions with the IMF to secure a 2.9 billion bailout seen as vital to getting its economy back on track. Sabry highlighted Saudi Arabia and Sri Lankas long-standing relations and the formers support in international forums. Sri Lanka and Saudi Arabia have been traditional friends for a long period of time. To strengthen bilateral relationship, particularly in the multilateral fora  the UN and other agencies  we have to support each other, he said. They (Saudis) have been supporting us when we have been cornered unfairly by some powers for no reason. They have stood by us time and again. So we need to strengthen that relationship. Sabry and Al-Marshad discussed development issues of common interest, and the Sri Lankan minister praised the Kingdoms efforts in developing infrastructure in Sri Lanka through SFD projects. The ministers meeting with Al-Hajraf focused on ties between Sri Lanka and the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC). GCC is very important. We are looking at signing a framework agreement with the GCC, we want to expedite it as soon as possible, Sabry said. On his discussions with Taha and OIC observer status, Sabry said: They are exploring the possibility of observer status, but we havent made the decision yet. Traditionally, we have had good relationships. Sabry also reassured Taha about the conditions of the Muslim community in Sri Lanka. Source: Arab News --Agencies",

Commenting in this regard, TNA parliamentarian and spokesperson M.A. Sumanthiran said they plan to declare the 4th of February as a Black Day and to commence a movement towards achieving that true freedom. Immediately after independence, it was transformed into a majority system under the guise of democracy. Thats why other people living in this country did not get freedom, he said. The Sinhala Buddhist people thought that they got freedom. However, they also now feel that they didnt get freedom, MP Sumanthiran said. Thats why when the President is celebrating the 75th Independence Day on February 4th, we would like to declare that no one living in this country got that freedom. That is why when this is celebrated, we will declare this as a black day and we will start a campaign for the country to get its freedom properly.",

        "date": "January 30, 2023 12:16 pm",
        "content": "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky says that allowing Russia to compete at the 2024 Olympics in Paris would amount to showing that terror is somehow acceptable. He said he had raised the issue with French President Emmanuel Macron. Moscow must not be allowed to use the Olympics for propaganda, he added. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) has said Russian and Belarusian athletes could compete as neutrals at the Olympics. But Ukraine has threatened to boycott Paris 2024 if Russian and Belarusian athletes are allowed to compete. Attempts by the IOC to bring Russian athletes back into the Olympic Games are attempts to tell the whole world that terror is somehow acceptable, Mr Zelensky said in his nightly video address. Russia must not be allowed to use the Games or any other sport event as propaganda for its aggression or its state chauvinism, he added. The IOC said this week that Russian and Belarusian athletes could compete as neutral athletes, stating that no athlete should be prevented from competing just because of their passport. But Mr Zelensky says there can be no neutrality in sport while his countrys athletes are dying on the battlefield. He also drew comparison with the 1936 Olympic Games in Berlin when the Nazis were in power. There was a major Olympic mistake, he said. The Olympic movement and terrorist states definitely should not cross paths. The UK government has also condemned the plan to allow athletes to compete neutrally as a world away from the reality of war. Mr Zelenskys comments came as Russian forces continued to bombard the Ukrainian region of Kherson into the night, after a day of attacks which left at least three people dead. Six others were wounded, two of them when a hospital was hit, local officials say. The Kherson regional administration said the region was shelled almost 40 times on Saturday and was pounded continually on Sunday. Kherson was the only regional capital to have fallen to Russian forces since the February 2022 invasion, but they were forced into a humiliating retreat in November. President Zelensky said Russia had also stepped up its attacks in the eastern Donetsk region. He said his forces needed new weapons to confront a very tough situation of constant attacks. Russia wants the war to drag on and exhaust our forces. So we have to make time our weapon. We have to speed up events, speed up supplies and open up new weapons options for Ukraine, he said.

        "date": "January 30, 2023 05:29 pm",
        "content": "The Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka (HRCSL) says it has filed a case of Contempt of Court before the Supreme Court against the Secretary to the Ministry of Energy  Power, the Chairman of the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) and the Chairman of the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC). The HRCSL said it has determined that the aforementioned parties have failed to abide by the settlement arrived at before the commission with regard to the continuous supply of power during the period pertaining to the Advanced Level Examination commencing from 23rd January to 17th February 2023. Issuing a statement, the commission stated that in the aforesaid circumstances in particular the Chairman of the Electricity Board is guilty of the offence of contempt under the provisions of the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka Act No. 21 of 1996. The Commission alleges that notwithstanding the settlement arrived by the above parties to provide uninterrupted electricity for the AL students during the period of the examination, the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) willfully and maliciously disregarded the settlement and continued with the power cuts. The settlement was to prevent the power cut only during the period of the AL examination, it said adding, that the Commission treats the said blatant disregard of the CEB to provide an uninterrupted electricity supply during the examination period is a gross violation of a childs right to education. The HRCSL alleges that having admitted before the Commission that there are meaningful ways to provide electricity, and settling on that basis, the CEB disregarded the assurance and proceeded with the power cut. The Commission found the unbecoming and outrageous behaviour of the State Officials of the CEB as an intentional affront to justice and contempt of the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka. In this backdrop, the certificate of contempt has been duly signed by the Commission and forwarded to the Supreme Court and a case of Contempt of Court has been filed before the Supreme Court in this regard which will be taken up in the due course and relevant parties will be heard with the main view of providing a relief to the AL candidates. The Commission said it will closely observe the developments in this regard. The Commission reiterated the position that the sole purpose of this intervention is only to ensure the rights of Citizens and in particular that of the AL Candidates are duly honoured and that the Commission assures its continuous efforts in upholding the rule of law of the country and Fundamental Rights of its citizens.",

        "title": "Death toll in Peshawar bombing climbs to 34 as Pakistan Taliban commander claims responsibility",
        "date": "January 30, 2023 06:08 pm",
        "content": "PESHAWAR, Pakistan (AP)  A suicide bomber struck Monday inside a mosque within a police compound in the northwestern Pakistani city of Peshawar, killing at least 34 people and wounding as many as 150 worshippers, most of them police, officials said. The bombing drew nationwide condemnation from opposition political parties and government officials. Ghulam Ali, the provincial governor in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, where Peshawar is the capital, said there were fears the death toll could rise even further. Most of the casualties were policemen and police officers  the targeted mosque is located within a sprawling compound, which also serves as the citys police headquarters. Police said between 300 to 350 worshipers were inside the mosque when the bomber detonated his explosives. Sarbakaf Mohmand, a commander for the Pakistani Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack on Twitter. The main spokesman for the organization was not immediately available for comment. The police compound is located in a high-security zone in Peshawar, along with several government buildings, and it was unclear how the bomber managed to penetrate so deep inside the zone unnoticed. The impact of the explosion collapsed the roof of the mosque, which caved in and injured many, according to Zafar Khan, a local police officer. Siddique Khan, a police official, said the death toll rose to 34, and the dead included Noor-ul-Amin, the prayer leader. Meanwhile, officials said at least 150 were wounded. A survivor, 38-year-old police officer Meena Gul, said he was inside the mosque when the bomb went off. He said he doesnt know how he survived unhurt. He could hear cries and screams after the bomb exploded, Gul said. Rescuers scrambled trying to remove mounds of debris from the mosque grounds and get to worshippers still trapped under the rubble, police said. At a nearby hospital, many of the wounded were listed in critical condition as the casualty toll rose. Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif in a statement condemned the bombing, and ordered authorities to ensure the best possible medical treatment to the victims. He also vowed stern action against those who were behind the attack. Former Prime Minister Imran Khan also condemned the bombing, calling it a terrorist suicide attack in a Twitter posting. My prayers  condolences go to victims families, said the ex-premier. It is imperative we improve our intelligence gathering  properly equip our police forces to combat the growing threat of terrorism. Peshawar has been the scene of frequent militant attacks. The Pakistani Taliban, are known as Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan or TTP, and are separate group but also a close ally of the Afghan Taliban, who seized power in neighboring Afghanistan in August 2021 as U.S. and NATO troops were in the final stages of their pullout from the country after 20 years of war. The TTP has waged an insurgency in Pakistan over the past 15 years, fighting for stricter enforcement of Islamic laws in the country, the release of their members who are in government custody and a reduction of the Pakistani military presence in the countrys former tribal regions. Pakistan has witnessed a surge in militant attacks since November when the Pakistani Taliban ended their cease-fire with government forces. The truce ended as Pakistan was still contending with last summers unprecedented flooding that killed 1,739 people, destroyed more than 2 million homes, and at one point submerged as much as one third of the country. The flood damages totaled to more than 30 billion and authorities are now, months later, still struggling to arrange tents, shelter and food for the survivors. Cash-strapped Pakistan is currently also facing one of the worst economic crisis and is seeking a crucial installment of 1.1 billion from the International Monetary Fund  part of its 6 billion bailout package  to avoid default. Talks with the IMF on reviving the bailout have stalled in the past months. Sharifs government came to power last April after Imran Khan was ousted in a no-confidence vote in Parliament. Khan has since campaigned for early elections, claiming his ouster was illegal and part of a plot backed by the United States. Washington and Sharif have dismissed Khans claims.

        "date": "January 31, 2023 12:15 am",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) - Holders of Sri Lankas foreign bonds want more clarity on the nations local-currency debt before they sit down for formal restructuring talks, according to people familiar with the situation. Creditors are concerned that managing Sri Lankas local debt pile will prove costly, which could reduce payments earmarked for foreign bondholders or even trigger another restructuring effort down the road, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the discussions are private. The Asian island nation seeks to restructure its Eurobonds while repaying its local-currency obligations in full. Some bondholders are recommending Sri Lanka follows in Ghanas footsteps to help its stalled restructuring efforts, they said. The African country has offered a debt swap plan for local securities in addition to its Eurobond negotiations. Sri Lanka defaulted on its dollar debt in May, and must clinch good-faith negotiations with private bondholders and debt assurances from bilateral creditors including China, Japan and India, to get the International Monetary Funds nod for a 2.9 billion loan. Local bonds make up about half of the central governments 70 billion debt pile, according to data from the Finance Ministry and the central bank. A spokesperson for the bondholder committee didnt immediately respond to a Bloomberg email and phone call seeking comment, saying that the panel will reply as soon as possible. IMF Focus Sri Lankas central bank governor Nandalal Weerasinghe said last week that the country will hold detailed talks on domestic debt treatment only after the IMF loan has been approved. In the meantime, the monetary authority is talking to local lenders on the debt recast and conducting an asset quality review to gauge any stress in the banking industry, he said. Creditors are worried that the government may end up allocating more than 8.5 proposed under its gross financing needs plan to domestic debt servicing, the people said. If domestic debt remains an issue, Sri Lanka may not be able to tap international debt markets for longer amid worries over potential future restructuring, they added. Ghana is following a three-pronged approach to overhauling its debt: a swap for local securities, a suspension of payments on Eurobonds and negotiations under the Group of 20 Common Framework for bilateral debt. Sri Lankas dollar bonds maturing in March 2030 are quoted at 35 cents on the dollar, up from Novembers low of around 22 cents. Meanwhile, Ghanas 1.25 billion bonds maturing in March 2032 are at 38 cents, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Fidelity Institutional Asset Management is the top holder of Sri Lankas dollar bonds, based on reported filings to Bloomberg, followed by Lord Abbett  Co. and Capital Group of Companies. Sri Lankas government aims to honor its pledge that only foreign debt will not be serviced and local obligations will be met, Junior Finance Minister Shehan Semasinghe said in December. Fitch Ratings last month cut its rating on the nations local-currency debt to two levels above default, citing untenably high domestic interest costs and challenging financing conditions. A default would put at risk the nations financial sector, which owns most of the local bonds. Sri Lanka is aiming to get the IMF loan by the end of March to help mend an economy that has fallen into recession amid sky-high inflation and elevated borrowing costs, and pave the way for further assistance.

It was the nations worst such attack in almost 11 months. We are still retrieving dead bodies from the debris, said Inquilab Khan, a shift supervisor at rescue agency Edhi in Peshawar, who gave the latest casualty toll. The explosion took place Monday during afternoon prayers, inside an area where Peshawars police headquarters and other government offices are located, Ghulam Ali, the governor of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, told reporters. Police are still looking through the ruins of the mosque, according to Peshawars police chief, Mohammad Ijaz Khan. Around 300-400 people from different offices gather for prayers at the mosque, he said. Since it happened during prayer time, we cant rule out a suicide attack. In March last year, the Islamic State group claimed responsibility for an attack on a Shia mosque that killed more than 60 worshipers. No group has claimed responsibility for the latest attack, but Pakistan has seen a spike in violence since the Taliban seized power in neighboring Afghanistan. The Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan, a militant group with links to the Afghan group, last year ended a cease-fire with the government in Islamabad and announced a resumption of attacks across the nation.

        "title": "Global economic outlook slightly less gloomy than expected, IMF says",
        "date": "January 31, 2023 10:06 am",
        "content": "The global economy will weaken this year as rising interest rates and Russias war in Ukraine continue to weigh on activity. But economists are more optimistic than they were just a few months ago. The International Monetary Fund said Monday that it now expects global growth will slow from 3.4 in 2022 to 2.9 in 2023. Thats up from a forecast of 2.7 in October. The upgrade in the outlook reflects Chinas sudden reopening, which the IMF said paves the way for a rapid rebound in activity. It also cited unexpected resilience in numerous economies in the second half of 2022, as well as an improvement in global financial conditions as inflation starts to ease and the US dollar comes down from its highs. The outlook is less gloomy than in our October forecast, and could represent a turning point, with growth bottoming out and inflation declining, Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, the IMFs director of research, wrote in a blog post. New forecasts The IMF emphasized that growth this year will remain weak by historical standards. (Between 2000 and 2019, the annual average was 3.8.) Central banks will need to continue their aggressive campaign to reduce decades-high inflation, which will result in a slowdown of economic activity. It predicted that nine out of ten advanced economies will likely decelerate. In the United States, growth is expected to slow from 2 in 2022 to 1.4 in 2023. Europe  whose economy has proved surprisingly hardy despite the regions energy crisis, in part due to a mild winter so far  is forecast to see growth among the 20 countries that use the euro drop from 3.5 to 0.7. The United Kingdom is expected to experience a contraction of 0.6. Its the only Group of Seven economy projected to shrink this year. Still, the IMF sees some improvements to the outlook. A major reason is China. Beijing ended its strict zero Covid policy late last year, reopening its borders and moving away from the harsh quarantine and testing policies that had held back growth in the worlds second-largest economy. Its 3 expansion in 2022 was one of the countrys worst performances in decades. The IMF now forecasts growth in China will rebound to 5.2 this year, notably higher than its previous estimate. Inflation trends are also promising. The IMF noted that overall measures are now decreasing in most countries, even if price increases for goods and services excluding food and energy have yet to peak in many cases. The headline annual reading of US inflation reached a high in June, while inflation in Europe has fallen since October, when it touched a record. Global inflation is forecast by the IMF to ease from 8.8 in 2022 to 6.6 in 2023 and 4.3 in 2024. Before the pandemic, it was near 3.5. A pullback in the strength of the US dollar since November, meanwhile, has been helpful for emerging market and developing economies. The greenbacks steep rally had made it more expensive to import commodities, including food and energy, and raised the cost of paying interest on some debt. Risks to the outlook remain substantial, the IMF warned. Chinas recovery could lose steam if future coronavirus waves keep people at home or the vulnerable property sector slows sharply. Inflation could stay elevated for longer than central banks would like, mandating tighter monetary policy. The war in Ukraine remains a key source of uncertainty. An escalation could add to disruptions in food and energy markets. For now, though, its feeling slightly better about the next 12 months  while stressing that they wont be easy. This time around, the global economic outlook hasnt worsened, Gourinchas wrote. Thats good news, but not enough. The road back to a full recovery, with sustainable growth, stable prices and progress for all, is only starting. Source: CNN -Agencies",

Joining a media briefing today (Jan 31), the SLFP leader expressed confidence about winning the election race. I am not the type of person to move backward. I am not scared of the conspiracies against me... Despite being harassed, I will contest the next presidential election with the support of my party. No matter how many votes I receive, I am confident that I can win the election. Sirisena went on to apologize for the coordinated suicide bomb attacks that devastated the country on Easter Sunday in 2019 while he was in office as the Head of State. The former president stated that the Catholic community does not harbour any feelings of hatred towards him over this tragic incident. Speaking on the sum of Rs. 100 million that the Supreme Court ordered him to pay in compensation to the victims of the Easter Sunday suicide bombings for violating human rights, Sirisena pointed out that according to the top courts judgment, he was held responsible for the mistakes committed by the officials appointed by him as the Head of State. Sirisena said, as a person who respects the countrys judiciary and the law, he accepted the judgment of the Supreme Court. On January 12, the Supreme Court found the former President, along with former Defence Secretary Hemasiri Fernando, former IGP Pujith Jayasundara, former National Intelligence Chief Sisira Mendis and former Chief of State Intelligence Nilantha Jayawardena in violation of the Fundamental Rights of petitioners, by failing to take action to prevent the Easter Sunday attacks despite receiving sufficient intelligence information.",

        "content": "The Year-on-Year (Y-o-Y) inflation based on the Colombo Consumer Price Index (CCPI) decreased to 54.2 in January 2023 from 57.2 seen in December 2022, the Department of Census and Statistics reported. Meanwhile, Y-o-Y inflation of Food Group has dropped to 60.1 in January 2023 from 64.4 in December 2022, it said quoting the latest data. According to the departments report, Y-o-Y Non-Food Group inflation decreased to 51 in January 2023 from 53.4 in December 2022. The CCPI for all items for the month of January 2023 was 244.3 and it recorded an increase of 1.1 in index points which is 0.43 percentage compared to the month of December 2022 for which the index was 243.2. The report said that Month on Month expenditure change was contributed by increases in Food and Non-Food categories of 0.23 and 0.20, respectively. Meanwhile, annual average inflation rose to 49.6 in January 2023 from 46.4 in December 2022. The core inflation (Y-o-Y), which reflects the underlying inflation in the economy, decreased to 45.6 in January 2023 from 47.7 in December 2022, whereas annual average core inflation increased to 37.6 in January 2023 from 34.6 in December 2022. The general price level has increased by 144.3 compared to the base year (2013). The CCPI is an economic indicator constructed to measure inflation which is defined as percentage change in CCPI over the year. There are two measures of inflation in general use. One measure is Year on Year base or Point to Point inflation (The percentage change in the CPI during the last 12 months). The other measure is Moving Average Inflation (The percentage difference between the average Price Index of last 12 months  the average Price Index of previous 12 months). In a statement in this regard, the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) stated that looking ahead, based on its latest macroeconomic projections, the declining trend of inflation is expected to continue through 2023, supported by subdued demand conditions owing to tight monetary and fiscal policy measures, anticipated improvements in domestic supply conditions, and the expected passthrough of easing global energy and food prices to domestic prices, along with the favourable statistical base effect. However, there are upside risks to this disinflation path arising from possible upward adjustments in domestic energy prices and any associated second round effects, delays in passing downward adjustments of global energy and food prices to domestic consumers, etc. Nevertheless, factors such as the reduced purchasing power of the public could soften inflationary pressures, exerting downside risks to inflation projections.

        "date": "January 31, 2023 04:08 pm",
        "content": "The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has approved loans of 4.7 billion to Bangladesh for disbursal starting immediately, making it the first to secure such funds out of three South Asian countries that applied last year amid economic trouble. The loans are a win for Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina ahead of a general election early next year and will help the country, which has seen a sharp widening of its current account deficit, depreciation of the taka currency and a decline in its foreign exchange reserves. Bangladesh will get about 3.3 billion under the IMFs extended credit facility and related arrangements, with an immediate disbursement of about 476 million. The IMF executive board also approved about 1.4 billion under its newly created Resilience and Sustainability Facility for climate investments for Bangladesh, the first Asian country to access it. The IMF said the loans will protect macroeconomic stability and rebuild buffers, while helping to advance the authorities reform agenda. The agenda includes creating fiscal space to enable greater social and developmental spending, strengthening Bangladeshs financial sector, boosting fiscal and governance reforms and building climate resilience. Since independence, Bangladesh has made steady progress in reducing poverty and significant improvements in living standards, Antoinette M. Sayeh, the IMFs deputy managing director, said in a statement. However, the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent Russias war in Ukraine interrupted this long period of robust economic performance, Sayeh added. Multiple shocks have made macroeconomic management challenging in Bangladesh. The country last year also sought 2 billion from the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank amid efforts to bolster its foreign exchange reserves. Bangladeshs regional counterparts, Sri Lanka and Pakistan, are doing much worse economically but have not been able to get final approval for IMF loans. Bangladeshs current account deficit hit a record 18.7 billion in the last financial year, which ended on June 30, as exports of garments failed to offset a surge in energy costs. The Bangladesh central bank expects the deficit to fall to about 6.8 billion at the end of the current fiscal year. The government has also raised fuel and energy prices in recent months as it approached the IMF. It announced a 5 increase in retail power prices from Wednesday, the second such rise this month.

        "date": "January 31, 2023 04:52 pm",
        "content": "Brazils former President Jair Bolsonaro has applied for a six-month tourist visa to remain in the United States, his lawyer said, as the far-right politician faces an investigation at home into accusations he helped incite this months riot in the Brazilian capital. US authorities received Bolsonaros visa application on Friday, his lawyer, Felipe Alexandre, told the Reuters news agency in an emailed statement on Monday. The news was first reported by The Financial Times. While the application is processed, Bolsonaro will remain in the US, Alexandre said. He would like to take some time off, clear his head, and enjoy being a tourist in the United States for a few months before deciding what his next step will be, the lawyer said. Whether or not he will use the full six months will be up to him and whatever strategy we agree to embark on based on his plans as they develop. Bolsonaro  who left Brazil for the US just days before his successor, left-wing President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, was inaugurated this month  has faced widespread criticism after a mob of his supporters rioted in the capital of Brasilia on January 8. Thousands of Bolsonaro supporters ransacked the countrys Congress, presidential palace and Supreme Court in a bid to pressure the military to overturn the October election results, which saw Lula narrowly defeat his far-right rival in a tense run-off. Bolsonaro, a former army captain who has expressed admiration for the military regime that ruled Brazil from 1964 to 1985, had falsely claimed for months that the countrys electronic voting system was vulnerable to fraud. He maintained a long public silence after the election results were confirmed and never formally recognised Lulas victory  prompting some observers to say that he helped set the stage for the riot in Brasilia, a charge Bolsonaro rejects. After the attack, Bolsonaro said on Twitter that peaceful protest is part of democracy, but vandalism and the invasion of public buildings were exceptions to the rule. His son, Senator Flavio Bolsonaro, also slammed attempts to link the former president to the riot, saying his father had been virtually incommunicado since the election results were announced. But in mid-January, Brazils Supreme Court agreed to open an investigation into allegations that Bolsonaro encouraged the anti-democratic protests that resulted in vandalism and violence in Brasilia. Public figures who continue to cowardly conspire against democracy trying to establish a state of exception will be held accountable, Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes, who is leading the probes, said at the time. Bolsonaro has been in the US state of Florida, where he briefly sought care at a local hospital earlier this month for abdominal pain linked to a knife wound he received during the 2018 presidential race, which he won. The former president previously said in an interview with CNN Brasil that he had planned to return to Brazil by the end of January and was considering moving his departure earlier for health reasons. He is understood to have entered the US on a visa for visiting world leaders, which expires on Tuesday as Bolsonaro is no longer on official business. A Bolsonaro ally, former Justice Minister Anderson Torres, also was on vacation in Florida when the January 8 riot in Brazils capital broke out. But Torres, who was in charge of security in Brasilia at the time of the attack, has since returned to Brazil, where he was arrested on accusations of connivance and omission. Bolsonaros presence in the US has drawn concern from some American legislators, who recently urged President Joe Biden not to provide shelter for him, or any authoritarian who has inspired such violence against democratic institutions. We should cooperate fully with Brazilian authorities in investigating any role Mr. Bolsonaro or those around him played in the events of January 8, and any crimes he committed when in office, dozens of US Congress members said in a January 12 letter to Biden. Nearly 1,400 people have been arrested in relation to the attack in Brasilia, with Lulas government pledging to hold accountable all those who participated in the riots, as well as those who helped plan and carry them out. - Agencies",

        "content": "The members of Public Utilities Commission (PUCSL) have unanimously decided not to implement an interim tariff revision with a retrospective effect. The decision of the electricity sector regulators members was communicated by the PUCSL chairman, Janaka Ratnayake. Earlier this month, Ratnayake raised concerns about the electricity tariff revision which was green-lighted by the Cabinet of Ministers, stating that it cannot be implemented with retrospective effect, pursuant to per the Electricity Act. Later, there was a rift in the PUCSL as two of its members went back on the decision taken at the commissions board meeting and agreed to implement the tariff revision retrospectively, following a meeting with the President. It was reported that Ratnayake had not been invited to the said meeting. Last week, the PUCSL told the National Council that its members have taken a unanimous decision to send relevant documents to the Attorney General, seeking advice on the possibility of increasing electricity tariffs retrospectively and prompt approval for the move. At the National Council meeting, Power  Energy Minister Kanchana Wijesekera has recalled the electricity charges revision in 2014, which came into effect retrospectively.",

        "date": "January 31, 2023 09:46 pm",
        "content": "Earnings from exports in 2022 surpassed USD 13 billion per year for the first time, recording an increase of 4.9 from the previous highest recorded in 2021, the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) says. This improvement was a result of increased earnings from industrial exports, including garments, gems, diamonds and jewellery, machinery and mechanical appliances and petroleum products. Meanwhile, total import expenditure in 2022 amounted to USD 18,291 million, recording a decline of 11.4, year-on-year, resulting from measures to restrict non-urgent imports and liquidity constraints that prevailed in the market for the most part of 2022. As a result, the deficit in the trade account in 2022 narrowed to the lowest level since 2010 to USD 5,185 million, from USD 8,139 million recorded in 2021. According to the CBSL, major contributory factors for the decline in the cumulative trade deficit in 2022 were textile garments; gems, diamonds and jewellery; transport equipment; telecommunication devices; building material; medical and pharmaceuticals; base metals; and machinery and equipment. The deficit in the merchandise trade account narrowed to USD 358 million in December 2022, from USD 1,085 million recorded in December 2021, helped by a larger decline in imports, compared to the decline in exports. Meanwhile, earnings from merchandise exports declined by 7.7 in December 2022, over December 2021, to USD 1,068 million. The decline in earnings from industrial exports mainly contributed to the decline in export earnings in December 2022. According to the CBSL, expenditure on merchandise imports declined by 36.4 in December 2022 to USD 1,426 million, compared to USD 2,241 million in December 2021, continuing the year-on-year declining trend observed since March 2022. The higher base in December 2021 and declines in volumes across all major categories resulted in this outcome. Workers remittances in 2022 amounted to USD 3,789 million, in comparison to USD 5,491 million in 2021, recording a decline of 31.0, though a notable recovery was witnessed during the latter part of the year. Meanwhile, workers remittances increased to USD 476 million during December 2022, in comparison to USD 384 million in the previous month, recording the highest monthly remittances during 2022. Total departures for foreign employment during 2022 were recorded at 299,934, contributed mainly by the unskilled (101,786), skilled (88,215) and domestic aid (73,781) categories. Total departures for foreign employment were recorded at 23,407 during the month of December 2022. The CBSL stated that a total of 719,978 tourist arrivals were recorded in 2022, compared to 194,495 arrivals in 2021, recording the highest tourist arrivals after 2019. Tourist arrivals increased notably in December 2022 to 91,961, from 59,759 arrivals recorded in November 2022. Russia, India, the United Kingdom, Australia, and Germany remained the main source countries for tourist arrivals in December 2022. Earnings from tourism are estimated at USD 1,136 million in 2022, compared to USD 507 million in 2021. Earnings from tourism in the month of December 2022 are estimated at USD 127 million, in comparison to USD 81 million in the previous month and USD 233 million in the corresponding month in the previous year. Foreign investments in the government securities market recorded a cumulative net inflow of USD 51 million during 2022, with a marginal net inflow in December 2022. Meanwhile, on a cumulative basis, the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE), including primary and secondary market transactions, recorded a net inflow of foreign investments amounting to USD 182 million in 2022. The foreign inflows to the CSE, including primary and secondary market transactions, recorded a notable net inflow in December 2022. The exchange rate remained stable through December 2022, following the introduction of daily permissible band from mid-May 2022. Annual depreciation of the rupee in 2022 was 44.8 against the US dollar, and reflecting cross-currency movements, the Sri Lanka rupee depreciated against the euro, the Australian dollar, the Indian rupee, the pound sterling, and the Japanese yen in 2022. Meanwhile, the rupee recorded an appreciation of 0.3 per cent against the US dollar during the year up to 31 January 2023. Reflecting cross-currency movements, the Sri Lanka rupee depreciated against the euro, the pound sterling, the Indian rupee, the Australian dollar, and the Japanese yen during the year up to 31 January 2023. The real effective exchange rate (REER 24) depreciated notably during Mar-May 2022 and remained largely below the threshold of 100 index points, indicating an improvement in Sri Lankas external competitiveness.

However, the second, third and fourth accused in the case were further remanded until February 14, on the orders of Colombo Additional Magistrate Rajindra Jayasuriya. One of the suspects, a 32-year-old broker in this kidney transplant racket, had been arrested in the Laundry Watta area in Armour Street, Colombo while the two Grama Niladhari officers belonging to the Sri Jayewardenepura Kotte and Kolonnawa Divisional Secretariat Divisions were arrested for aiding and abetting the racket by falsifying documents for a fee of Rs. 20,000 each. The suspect who was arrested by the Colombo Crimes Division yesterday (Jan 30) in Wellampitiya area was ordered to be referred to an identification parade, after taking into a request made by Senior Deputy Solicitor General Dileepa Peiris. Meanwhile, the defence attorneys told the court that the police are yet to obtain statements from the doctors who were involved in the racket and that the police officer who played a part in the racket too is at large. The 53-year-old from Kolonnawa, who acted as an intermediary in the racket, was accordingly produced before the additional magistrate this morning. The case had been filed based on a complaint lodged by five individuals including a woman with the Borella Police, alleging that a private hospital located in Rajagiriya has been duping members of low-income families into selling their kidneys by promising them a high sum of money in return.",

        "date": "February 1, 2023 09:43 am",
        "content": "The World Health Organization said Monday that COVID-19 remains a public health emergency but the pandemic is at a transition point. The agency said its International Health Regulations Emergency Committee met on Friday to analyze data on the state of the pandemic. WHO Director-General Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus acknowledges the Committees views that the COVID-19 pandemic is probably at a transition point and appreciates the advice of the Committee to navigate this transition carefully and mitigate the potential negative consequences, the statement read. According to a transcript of Tedros speech at the meeting provided by the WHO, he said there is still a high risk of COVID-19 global transmission, which means the virus is still classified as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. However, he said the world is in the best position it has been in -- due to diagnostics, vaccines and treatments -- to beat back COVID. As we enter the fourth year of the pandemic, we are certainly in a much better position now than we were a year ago, when the omicron wave was at its peak, and more than 70,000 deaths were being reported to WHO each week, Tedros said during the meeting, according to a transcript provided by the WHO. When you last met in October, the number of weekly reported deaths was near the lowest since the pandemic began -- less than 10 thousand a week. However, since the beginning of December, the number of weekly reported deaths globally has been rising, Tedros continued. But the global response remains hobbled because in too many countries, these powerful, life-saving tools are still not getting to the populations that need them most  especially older people and health workers. Dr. John Brownstein, an epidemiologist and chief innovation officer at Boston Childrens Hospital, said the WHOs comments show that the agency recognizes the public health emergency is winding down but that the viruss threat remains. What we have to remember is the pandemic wont end on a given day, said Brownstein, an ABC News contributor. The metrics around cases, hospitalizations and deaths are painting a more optimistic picture and were seeing more countries getting out of this acute phase. He added that the danger of COVID is still very real, with deaths twice as high from COVID as they are from the flu. If you look at data around deaths, were still seeing twice as many people dying from COVID than flu every season and flu is only a quarter of a year, and were seeing that number, Brownstein said. During the WHO meeting, Tedros urged groups at higher risk of severe disease and death -- including those who are immunocompromised and elderly -- to be fully vaccinated and boosted. He also encouraged more countries to ramp up testing and use antivirals early on among those who test positive for COVID-19. Source: ABC News -Agencies",
