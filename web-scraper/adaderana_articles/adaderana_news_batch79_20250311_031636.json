        "date": "January 1, 2024 05:40 pm",
        "content": "The Ministerial Sub-Committee for Cricket has handed over its report to President Ranil Wickremesinghe at the Presidential Secretariat, a short while ago. The report was handed over to President Wickremesinghe by Minister of Foreign Affairs Mr. Ali Sabri, PC, who chairs the committee. Notably, this report was swiftly completed within a brief span of one and a half months following the establishment of the Cabinet Sub-Committee, the Presidents Media Division (PMD) reported. On 06 November 2023, President Wickremesinghe appointed a four-member committee, chaired by Minister Ali Sabry, and comprising of Ministers Tiran Alles, Manusha Nanayakkara and Kanchana Wijesekara, to look into matters concerning SLC, after then Sports Minister Roshan Ranasinghe had decided to appoint a seven-member Interim Committee for Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC), chaired by World Cup-winning former Sri Lanka captain Arjuna Ranatunga. Presidents Secretary Saman Ekanayake, appointed the Additional Secretary to the President, Mrs. Loshini Peiris, as the SecretaryConvener of the committee. The Interim Committee, comprising of retired Supreme Court judges S.I. Imam and Rohini Marasinghe, retired High Court judge Irangani Perera, Upali Dharmasena, Attorney-at-Law Rakitha Rajapakshe and Hisham Jamaldeen, had been appointed to carry out the boards operations until further notice or until an election is held, under the authority granted to him by the Sports Law No. 25 of 1973. However, President Ranil Wickremesinghe had not been notified about the sports ministers decision to appoint the said interim committee, its composition or the decision to suspend the previous board. Internal sources said the Head of State had only come to know of the interim panels appointment through a media report. Thus, the ministerial sub-committee was appointed to look into the sports ministers move, with the consent of the Sports Minister and the President. The committee promptly initiated an investigation into the current situation of Sri Lankan cricket by engaging with relevant parties. Accordingly: 1. The composition and structure of the Sri Lanka Cricket and proposals for reforms. 2. The framework for administering, coaching and overall well-being of cricket players at different levels including the national teams for men and women, the under 19 and under 17 age groups. 3. Appropriate good governance and best practices that can be adopted to guarantee transparency, professionalism and accountability in the system benchmarking with well-functioning comparative systems in test-playing countries. 4. Revamping the feeding structure of Sri Lanka Cricket namely schools, district, provincial and club level cricket embracing meritocracy, equality and equity. 5. The committee has resolved to concentrate on the four identified areas. To comprehensively analyse the root causes of the present crisis, a thorough examination will involve key stakeholders. These include the current Sports Minister, Harin Fernando, former Sports Ministers, State Ministers for Sports, Secretary of the Ministry of Sports, Sri Lanka Cricket, coaches of the Sri Lanka National Cricket Team (WomensMens), umpires, cricket selecting committee, coaches of the under-19 cricket team, technical advisory committee, members of the current cricket team led by Wanindu Hasaranga, Sri Lanka umpires Association, Sri Lanka Bar Association, Audit and Accounting institutes, and the committee led by retired Supreme Court judge K.T. Chitrasiri, which has incorporated recommendations following an investigation of the opinions of the Auditor General, among others. Attorneys-at-law Shamir Zavahir and Samhan Munzir have made invaluable contributions to the preparation of the report and research. Additionally, the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Presidential Secretariat played a crucial role in providing special support for this endeavour. Upon accepting the report, President Ranil Wickremesinghe conveyed his commitment to implementing the recommendations outlined in the report. He also expressed his intention to present both this report and the draft of the new Sports Act to Parliament in the near future. The President extended his appreciation to the Cabinet Sub-Committee for the prompt presentation of the report.

        "title": "I bear the accountability for these challenging decisions - President",
        "date": "January 1, 2024 08:49 pm",
        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe underscored that decisive actions would lead Sri Lanka to rapid economic growth this year. Despite facing criticism for these challenging decisions, he emphasized that they were undertaken in the best interest of the country. The President expressed his hope for unity in the New Year, urging collaboration among political parties to fulfil their collective responsibility in safeguarding the nation. These remarks were made during President Wickremesinghes attendance at the opening ceremony of the new Air Force Headquarters at the Akuregoda, Battaramulla Military Headquarters this morning (01). As the Commander-in-Chief, President Ranil Wickremesinghe was warmly received with military honours upon his arrival at the Air Force Headquarters, marking a significant event in the nations commitment to modernizing its defence infrastructure. Continuing the auspicious occasion, President Ranil Wickremesinghe formally inaugurated the new Air Force Headquarters by unveiling the commemorative plaque. Subsequently, he actively participated in the observation of the parade organized by the Air Force. In a symbolic display, Air Force planes soared in the sky, paying tribute to the President and highlighting the significance of the event. Following these formalities, President Wickremesinghe engaged in a cordial exchange with Air Force members, extending his heartfelt congratulations for the New Year. Addressing the event, the President further stated: Today marks a momentous occasion for the Air Force, commemorating 73 years of dedicated service. Throughout its history, the Air Force has played a pivotal role in rescuing citizens from the perils of terrorist wars, internal conflicts, and natural disasters. The inauguration of the modern Air Force Headquarters equipped with cutting-edge technology signifies a significant milestone, enabling the provision of technical expertise crucial for addressing future challenges. The Air Forces role in positioning Sri Lanka as a defence hub in the Indian Ocean is of immense significance. To fulfill this role effectively, our forces must advance with new knowledge and technology. The application of modern security knowledge not only aids in addressing domestic challenges but also empowers us to identify and resolve international issues. The establishment of the Air Force Headquarters within the Army Headquarters today is viewed as an inaugural move towards the modernization of our defence infrastructure. As part of a comprehensive plan, the previous Air Force Headquarters office is scheduled to be transferred to the Police Headquarters, optimizing the use of existing facilities. Additionally, there are strategic intentions to dismantle the structures formerly housing the Police Headquarters and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. This ambitious initiative envisions transforming the vacated area into a vibrant tourist zone, aligning with broader urban development objectives and promoting economic diversification. The present challenge before us is the task of rebuilding the countrys economy, a responsibility that rests on the shoulders of all citizens. Upon assuming the presidency, I inherited a nation grappling with a complete economic collapse. Consequently, the onus to revive the countrys economy was entrusted to me. Faced with a critical decision, I deliberated with the cabinet on whether to engage in political exercises or directly focus on the formidable task of economic reconstruction. Contemplating the economic hardships confronting Lebanon, where an economic program encountered a two-year delay, and the extended recovery period of Greece lasting thirteen years due to political instability, I sought an alternative path. Unlike the extreme measures adopted by certain nations, like slashing public service wages by 50, I was resolute in avoiding such severe actions. Recognizing a decline in our Gross Domestic Product (GDP), we opted for a more calculated and direct strategy. Through the implementation of clear-cut decisions, our aim was to attain a specific level of economic resilience by the end of 2023. To fortify the nations economy, timely and essential decisions must be made. Our aim is to attain a 3 economic growth rate this year, with a commitment to advancing even more rapidly. Several countries have expressed their support, raising inquiries about our ability to service the incurred debt in the future. To address this concern, it is imperative to diversify and create new sources of income, ensuring the sustainability of our economic recovery. Last year, the government revenue reached Rs. 3.1 trillion, constituting 12 of our GDP. As part of our strategic vision, we aim to elevate the GDP to 15 by 2026. In the year 2024, we have set a target of achieving Rs. 4.2 trillion in government revenue, necessitating a revision of the Value Added Tax (VAT). In our pursuit of fiscal responsibility, we anticipate a primary surplus of 8 decimals. However, it is essential to maintain a primary surplus at 2.3 until 2025 as we diligently work towards these objectives. Despite the inherent challenges, our commitment to a comprehensive program aimed at strengthening the countrys economy remains unwavering. Acknowledging the inherent difficulty of the task at hand, I have carefully considered the challenges associated with the decisions we are making. It is not without recognizing the complexities and obstacles that I have pondered these choices extensively. The weight of the responsibility lies in understanding that without taking these decisive measures, we risk facing a recurrence of the last economic crisis. Conversely, implementing this program represents an opportunity for the country to forge a path toward a better future. Despite the difficulties, the potential for positive transformation and sustained growth is significant. It is with a clear understanding of these considerations and a steadfast commitment to the well-being and prosperity of the nation that I have made these decisions for the country. Assuming the role of the presidency was not driven by a desire for popularity but rather a commitment to nation-building and securing a prosperous future for citizens and their children. Consequently, challenging decisions must be made for the greater good. I have communicated these decisions to the Prime Minister and the Cabinet, who have concurred, and I express gratitude for their support. Recognizing the challenges associated with tax collection, we have sought assistance from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to establish a new revenue authority. These collaborative efforts aim to elevate the countrys economy to approximately 5 by the fiscal year 2025-2026. The current trajectory falls short of our aspiration for future generations, necessitating a growth target of 8-9. Deliberations are underway to chart a course towards achieving this ambitious goal. In assuming the responsibility of making challenging decisions to fortify the nations economy, I bear the accountability for these choices. It is incumbent upon fellow politicians to recognize their duty in safeguarding the nation. Collaboration is imperative as we unite to bolster the countrys economic foundations. A collective effort is pivotal in ensuring swift development post-2024. I earnestly call upon everyone to contribute to this shared endeavour. In attendance at this significant event were distinguished individuals including State Minister for Defence Mr. Premitha Bandara Tennakoon, Senior Adviser to the President on National Security and Chief of Staff to the President Mr. Sagala Ratnayaka, Secretary to the Ministry of Defence General Kamal Gunaratne (Retired), Governor of the Western Province Marshal of the Air Force Mr. Roshan Gunathilake, Chief of Defence Staff General Shavendra Silva, Air Force Commander Air Marshal Udeni Rajapaksa, Army Commander Lt. Gen. Vikum Liyanage, Navy Commander Vice Admiral Priyantha Perera and a cohort of esteemed military officers, encompassing retired Air Force personnel.",

        "date": "January 1, 2024 10:09 pm",
        "content": "The Israeli military has said it expects the conflict in Gaza to continue throughout 2024. In a new years message, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) spokesman said troop deployments were being adjusted to prepare for prolonged fighting. Daniel Hagari said some troops - especially reservists - would be withdrawn to allow them to regroup. These adaptations are intended to ensure the planning and preparation for continuing the war in 2024, he said. The IDF must plan ahead out of an understanding that there will be additional missions and the fighting will continue the rest of the year. He said that some reservists would leave Gaza as soon as this week to allow them to re-energise ahead of the coming operations. Some 21,978 people - mostly women and children - have been killed in Gaza since 7 October, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Its latest update said 56,697 people in Gaza had been wounded over the same period. The figures included 156 people killed and 246 injured in the last 24 hours, the ministry added. The latest war was triggered by an unprecedented cross-border attack by Hamas gunmen on southern Israel on 7 October, in which 1,200 people were killed - most of them civilians - and about 240 others taken hostage. Israel continued its bombardment of Gaza up until the end of what has been a dark year in the region. The IDF said it killed a senior Hamas commander involved in the 7 October attack, Adil Mismah, in an overnight strike on the town of Deir al-Balah. The Gaza health ministry reported at least 48 deaths in overnight bombing in Gaza City. Witnesses told the AFP news agency that another strike killed 20 people sheltering at Al-Aqsa University in the citys west. Another strike strike on Monday morning was said to have killed at least 10 people in the al-Maghazi refugee camp. The BBC has not been able to verify the latest battlefield reports. A resident of northern Gaza displaced to the south of the enclave highlighted the contrast between New Year celebrations around the world and the situation in Gaza. Tonight the sky in world countries will be lit by firecrackers, and joyful laughs will fill the air, Zainab Khalil, 57, told Reuters on Sunday. In Gaza our skies are now filled with Israeli missiles and tank shells that land on innocent, homeless civilians. The UN says 85 of Gazas 2.4 million people - almost two million - have now been displaced. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Saturday that the war is at its height. We are fighting on all of the fronts, he said. We have huge success but we also have painful cases. Achieving victory will require time. As the (army) chief of staff has said, the war will continue for many more months. Israels far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich called for Palestinians to leave Gaza and make way for Israelis who could make the desert bloom. The official line from the Israeli government is that Gazans will eventually be able to return to their homes, though it has yet to outline how or when this will be possible. Air raid sirens sounded in Tel Aviv and southern Israel as it saw in the new year, with Israeli missile defence systems intercepting rockets fired from Gaza, AFP reported. One man who was in Tel Aviv celebrating the new year with friends said: I was terrified, like it was the first time I saw missiles. Its terrifying. Hamass military wing, the Ezzedine al-Qassam Brigades, claimed responsibility for both attacks in a video posted on social media. They said they used M90 rockets in response to the massacres of civilians perpetrated by Israel. Source - BBC - Agencies",

        "date": "January 1, 2024 10:11 pm",
        "content": "State Minister for Finance, Shehan Semasinghe, emphasized that the sustained single-digit inflation has significantly contributed to fostering business confidence within the country. During a press conference at the Presidential Media Centre (PMC) themed Collective Path to a Stable Country, held today (01) the State Minister disclosed that the state revenue accounted for 11.2 of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 2023, with projections indicating an anticipated increase to 15 by the year 2026. In his remarks, State Minister for Finance, Shehan Semasinghe, provided insights into the economic landscape, stating that the country is poised to achieve a 1.7 economic growth in the third quarter of 2023. He highlighted the notable recovery, noting that the overall economic growth for the year 2023 is anticipated to be approximately -3, a marked improvement from the -11 recorded in 2022. The balance of the primary account, which was negative at Rs. 895 billion in 2022, has now turned positive, standing at Rs. 333 billion as of November 2023. Furthermore, State Minister Semasinghe informed that, with the receipt of the second tranche from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), foreign reserves projected to surpass US dollars 4 billion. This includes contributions of US dollars 337 million from the IMF, US dollars 220 million from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and US dollars 250 million from the World Bank (WB). The successful maintenance of inflation within single digits has been pivotal in fostering business confidence, especially considering the significant reduction from 70 in 2022 to an anticipated 5 in 2024. This achievement stands as a cornerstone for building trust in the countrys business environment. In terms of state income, it is anticipated to reach RS.3110 billion in 2023, surpassing the revised estimate of 2850 billion. This would represent a state income of 11.2 compared to GDP. Ambitiously, there are plans to propel this figure to a 15 growth by 2026. The country has witnessed a noteworthy upturn in the number of tax files, reflecting a positive trend in tax compliance. In 2019, the total number of registered taxpayers stood at 1,705,233. However, owing to various policy decisions, this figure decreased to 677,613 in 2020 and further to 507,085 in 2021. Demonstrating a commendable success in policy implementation, the number of tax files rebounded from 437,547 in 2022 to a significant milestone of one million. Upon assuming office, the current government inherited unpaid bills exceeding Rs. 350 billion, a challenge that has now been effectively addressed with the settlement of all outstanding amounts. Additionally, the government achieved the noteworthy milestone of settling bills for all approved projects by December 15, 2023. Going forward, a principled commitment has been established to ensure that payments are not delayed by more than one month, starting from 2024. Furthermore, in the coming year, the government is set to initiate the Aswesuma application process, starting at the end of January or the beginning of February 2024. The December instalment for 1,410,064 beneficiaries has already been disbursed, and the government aims to extend these benefits to a total of 02 million people. Rigorous efforts are underway to identify eligible recipients and rectify any shortcomings observed in the benefits distribution process from the preceding year, demonstrating the governments commitment to effective and targeted support.",

Lee Jae-myung, who narrowly lost the presidential elections in 2022, was stabbed on the left side of his neck on Tuesday morning. The male attacker was arrested at the scene. Mr Lee was transferred to a hospital about 20 minutes after the attack. He was conscious at the time, Yonhap said. The attacker appeared to be in his 50s or 60s, news reports said. He reportedly approached Mr Lee asking for an autograph, before suddenly lunging forward to stab him. Videos of the attack posted on social media show Mr Lee first collapsing into the crowd and then onto the ground, while several people try to restrain the attacker. Photographs show Mr Lee lying on the ground with his eyes closed while someone presses a handkerchief to the side of his neck. Mr Lee, 59, leads the Democratic Party of Korea. He is not currently a member of South Koreas legislature but is widely expected to run for a seat in the next general election, which will take place in April 2024. He lost the 2022 presidential elections with a 0.73 difference in votes to current President Yoon Suk-yeol, making it the closest presidential race in South Korean history.

        "date": "January 2, 2024 10:05 am",
        "content": "Rescue teams in Japan on Tuesday struggled to reach isolated areas hit by a powerful earthquake on New Years Day, with reports of more than 20 people dead in a disaster that toppled buildings and knocked out power to thousands of homes. The quake with a preliminary magnitude of 7.6 struck in the middle of the afternoon on Monday, prompting residents in some coastal areas to flee to higher ground as tsunami waves hit Japans west coast, sweeping some cars and houses into the sea. Thousands of army personnel, firefighters and police officers from across the country have been dispatched to the worst-hit area in the Noto peninsula in Ishikawa prefecture. However, rescue efforts have been hindered by badly damaged and blocked roads and authorities say they are finding it difficult to assess the full extent of the damage. Many rail services, ferries and flights into the area have been suspended, and one of the regions airports has been forced to close due to cracks in the runway. The search and rescue of those impacted by the quake is a battle against time, Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said during an emergency disaster meeting on Tuesday. Kishida said rescuers were finding it very difficult to reach the northern tip of the Noto peninsula due to wrecked roads, and that helicopter surveys had discovered many fires and widespread damage to buildings and infrastructure. Citing local authorities, Kyodo news agency reported more than 20 deaths from the quake. Public broadcaster NHK said 15 had died just in the hard-hit town of Wajima near the epicentre, where there were also 14 cases of people trapped in collapsed buildings. Japans disaster management agency said it had received unconfirmed reports of 19 deaths earlier on Tuesday but official updates on the toll have been infrequent. More than 140 tremors have been detected since the quake first hit on Monday, according to the Japan Meteorological Agency. The agency has warned more strong shocks could hit in the coming days. WRECKED HOMES Nobuko Sugimori, a 74-year-old resident of Nanao city in Ishikawa, told Reuters she had never experienced such a quake before. I tried to hold the TV set to keep it from toppling over, but I could not even keep myself from swaying violently from side to side, Sugimori said from her home which had a large crack down its front wall and furniture scattered around the inside. Across the street, a car was crushed under a collapsed building where residents had another close call. Fujiko Ueno, 73, said nearly 20 people were in her house for a new year celebration when the quake struck but miraculously all emerged uninjured. It all happened in the blink of an eye she said, standing in the street among debris from the wreckage and mud that oozed out of the roads cracked surface. President Joe Biden said in a statement the United States was ready to provide any necessary help to Japan after the earthquake. As close allies, the United States and Japan share a deep bond of friendship that unites our people. Our thoughts are with the Japanese people during this difficult time, he said. The Japanese government ordered more than 97,000 people to evacuate their homes on Monday night, sending them to sports halls and school gymnasiums, commonly used as evacuation centres in emergencies. Many returned to their homes on Tuesday as authorities lifted tsunami warnings. But around 33,000 households remained without power in Ishikawa prefecture early on Tuesday morning after a night where temperatures dropped below freezing, according to Hokuriku Electric Powers (9505.T) website. Most areas in the northern Noto peninsula also have no water supply, NHK reported. The Imperial Household Agency said it would cancel Emperor Naruhito and Empress Masakos slated New Year appearance on Tuesday following the disaster. Kishida postponed his New Year visit to Ise Shrine scheduled for Thursday. NUCLEAR PLANTS The quake comes at a sensitive time for Japans nuclear industry, which has faced fierce opposition from some locals since the 2011 earthquake and tsunami that triggered nuclear meltdowns in Fukushima. Whole towns were devastated in that disaster. Japan last week lifted an operational ban imposed on the worlds biggest nuclear plant, Kashiwazaki-Kariwa, which has been offline since the 2011 tsunami. The Nuclear Regulation Authority said no irregularities were found at nuclear plants along the Sea of Japan, including five active reactors at Kansai Electric Powers (9503.T) Ohi and Takahama plants in Fukui Prefecture. Hokuriku Electrics Shika plant, the closest to the epicentre, had already halted its two reactors before the quake for regular inspections and saw no impact from the quake, the agency said. Chip equipment maker Kokusai Electric (6525.T) said it is investigating further after finding some damage at its factory in Toyama ahead of the planned resumption of operations on Thursday. Sharp (6753.T) said it has not confirmed any major damage at its factory in the area. Komatsu (6301.T) said it has not received information about any major damage and Toshiba said it is making checks. Source: Reuters -Agencies",

        "content": "At least three people were killed and five seriously injured when gunmen in camouflage fatigues opened fire on villagers in Indias restive northeastern state of Manipur, officials said on Tuesday, as sporadic violence continued in the region. At least 180 people have died since fierce fighting broke out between members of the majority Meitei and minority Kuki communities in the state in May, following a court order suggesting privileges granted to Kukis also be extended to Meiteis. The latest violence was reported from the Lilong area of Thoubal district on Monday when the group in camouflage fatigues opened indiscriminate fire on locals. Three people died of bullet wounds while five others are in hospital with multiple injuries, a senior police official told Reuters by phone. There was no immediate word on the identities of the victims or the suspected identities of the assailants. Authorities have re-imposed an indefinite curfew in Thoubal district and four other adjoining districts of Imphal East, Imphal West, Kakching and Bishnupur since Monday night. Manipur, bordering Myanmar, is among the smallest states in India with a population of 3.2 million people. Of its residents, 16 are Kukis, who live in the hills and receive economic benefits and quotas for government jobs and education, while 53 are Meiteis, who control the more prosperous lowlands.

        "title": "Tsunami warnings lifted in Japan as quakes death toll rises to 30",
        "date": "January 2, 2024 12:06 pm",
        "content": "Scenes of devastation emerged along Japans western coast Tuesday as rescuers raced to save residents trapped in the rubble of a 7.5 magnitude quake and aftershocks that hit central Japan, killing at least 30. The quake shook the Noto Peninsula in Ishikawa prefecture Monday afternoon, collapsing buildings, sparking fires and triggering tsunami alerts as far away as eastern Russia. Japans Meteorological Agency lifted all tsunami advisories along portions of the countrys western coast Tuesday, but almost 24 hours after the quake struck, there has been limited access to the northern part of the secluded Noto Peninsula. Prime Minister Fumio Kishida told reporters after a disaster emergency meeting Tuesday that a destroyed road had cut access to the area. Officials in helicopters had flown over the peninsula, known for its coastal scenery and rural landscapes, and reported seeing damaged roads, landslides and large fires, he said. To secure the route there, we are to mobilize all the means of transport, not only on the ground but also by aerial and marine transport. We have been making an effort to transfer goods, supplies and personnel there since the last night, Kishida said. Ishikawa prefecture officials said at least 30 people had been confirmed dead. The central city of Wajima, home to more than 27,000 people, appeared to be among the worst hit. Wajima city officials told CNN that 15 people were confirmed dead there. The coastal city is famous for its morning market and fine traditional lacquerware, but early surveys from the air on Tuesday revealed smoldering fires and large plumes of smoke engulfing streets of destroyed buildings. More than 100 shops and houses had burned down in Wajima Monday evening after a fire broke out following the quake, Japans public broadcaster NHK reported. Earlier the city saw tsunami waves of around 1.2 meters (3.9 feet), according to NHK. The earthquake and tsunami warnings prompted thousands of people to flee coastal areas. As of Tuesday morning, more than 30,200 people in Ishikawa had taken shelter in 336 evacuation centers, a spokesperson for the prefectures government told CNN. While the extent of the damage from Mondays quake is still being determined, it is far from the levels of destruction wrought by 2011s 9.0 magnitude quake, which triggered a tsunami causing a nuclear meltdown at the Fukushima power plant, in a disaster thats still being felt to this day. Overnight rescue efforts Prime Minister Kishida said Tuesday members of Japans Self Defense Force had joined police and fire emergency teams in rescuing people from devastated areas overnight. Rescue efforts are a battle against time. Especially the victims of collapsed buildings, have to be saved as soon as possible, he said. Japans fire department said Monday it was responding to reports of people being trapped under damaged buildings, NHK reported. An elderly man who had been pulled from a house that collapsed in the quake was later confirmed to have died, according to NHK, citing police in Ishikawa. Health officials in the city of Suzu said some doctors could not treat wounded patients because damaged roads meant they were unable to travel to work. Meanwhile, 45,700 households in Ishikawa remained without power Tuesday, according to the power company Hokuriku Electric Power. Following the quake, Japans Kansai Electric and Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi said no abnormalities were reported at nuclear plants near the affected areas. Four bullet trains, whose high-speed journeys were halted when the quake struck, trapping nearly 1,400 passengers inside for about 11 hours, resumed services Tuesday morning, according to NHK, citing Japan Railways West. The high-speed trains had been stranded between the central Japanese cities of Toyama and Kanazawa following the 7.5 magnitude tremor. Tsunami warnings lifted but threat of aftershocks remain Mondays powerful quake prompted the Japan Meteorological Agency to immediately issue a major tsunami warning  the first since 2011s devastating earthquake and tsunami  for Noto but later downgraded it to a tsunami warning. Tsunami warnings were later canceled as the threat of further tsunami waves diminished. Under Japans tsunami warning system, waves expected less than 1 meter fall under tsunami advisory, while those expected up to 3 meters fall under tsunami warning and waves expected above 5 meters fall under major tsunami warning. The first waves were reported hitting the coast just over 10 minutes after the quake. Video shows a wave crashing over a protective sea wall in the western city of Suzu Monday. According to the United States Geological Survey, at least 35 smaller aftershocks were reported near the epicenter of the quake. Susan Hough, a seismologist with the US Geological Survey warned that aftershocks could last for months. Hough said people living in that part of the country have felt quakes before, but she believes this is the biggest earthquake by far  which means most residents likely dont have experience with a seismic event of this scale. An earthquake this big is going to continue to have aftershocks. It could easily have aftershocks bigger than magnitude 6, so that is going to be a hazard in its own right, Hough said.

        "content": "The Sectoral Oversight Committee on National Security took into discussion matters contained in the National Hydrographic Bill, which gives the necessary legal authority to create Electronic Navigational Charts so that Sri Lanka can earn an annual dollar income from ships sailing near Sri Lankan waters. It was taken into discussion when the said Committee met in Parliament recently under the chairmanship of Member of Parliament Dr. Sarath Weerasekera, the Parliamentary Communications Department said in a statement. Dr. Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe who was present at the Committee meeting, stated that since 1983 the right to receive dollars from ships traveling through Sri Lankan waters has not been utilized. Accordingly, the Minister of Justice further commented that Sri Lanka will get the necessary legal power through the passing of this Bill. Furthermore, through the establishment of the National Hydrographic Office, the officials stated that the purpose of this Act is to register hydrographic surveyors and nautical cartographers and to make provisions for related matters, it added. The Navy stated that the Royal Navy of England has created 3 maps covering the South Seas. Accordingly, the officials further commented that only data has been provided from Sri Lanka for the creation of the maps. However, the Navy officials informed the Committee that the Sri Lankan government has the right to explore and obtain data and create maps for the relevant sea areas through this Act. Based on this updated data, related maps can also be updated and dollars can be generated, the officials further said. Officials of the National Aquatic Resources Research and Development Agency (NARA) who addressed the Committee said that some of the functions carried out by their Agency will be drifted away by this Bill. However, the Committee Chair pointed out that this Bill is currently scheduled to be debated in the Parliament and pointed out that during the Committee Stage, the NARA institution will be given the opportunity to add amendments to it through the relevant Minister.

The Cabinet of Ministers, at its meeting on Monday (Jan.01), approved a proposal tabled by President Ranil Wickremesinghe aimed at regularizing short message exchanges in order to confront fraud and spam and other illegal activities. A2P is the process of sending mobile messages from a business application to a mobile user, usually via an automated process, for marketing or service reasons. The SMS is commonly used for various objectives including the evaluation of enterprises and transactions as a decisive communication media for citizens, businesses and government institutions. These messages are distributed by an individual across an app or a system to a mobile device as SMS, multimedia message (MMS) or any other type of message. Noting that the excessive use of short message systems has led to fraud, spam and illegal activities, the government said it had observed the requirement for a centralized short message system network security appliance firewall (SMS Firewall) to regularize short message exchange in order to confront such challenges. Accordingly, a proposal had been submitted for implementing an international A2P short message services centre by Infobip, a United Kingdom-based private company.

        "date": "January 2, 2024 02:45 pm",
        "content": "U.S. singer, dancer and American Idol star Paula Abdul filed a lawsuit accusing British television executive Nigel Lythgoe of sexually assaulting her when they worked together on two popular talent shows, according to court documents. Abdul, who rose to fame as a chart-topping singer in the late 1980s, alleged in a lawsuit filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court on Friday that Lythgoe sexually assaulted her in an elevator during the early seasons of TV singing competition series American Idol. Lythgoe, the producer of several hit television talent competitions, allegedly groped Abduls breasts and genitals, among other unwanted physical contact in a hotel elevator after a day of auditions for American Idol. Abdul tried to push him away and ran as soon as the elevator doors opened, court documents said. Reuters was not immediately able to reach Abdul or Lythgoe for comment. Lythogoe denied the allegations, according to TMZ. For more than two decades, Paula and I have interacted as dear -- and entirely platonic -- friends and colleagues, he told TMZ. Yesterday, however, out of the blue, I learned of these claims in the press and I want to be clear: not only are they false, they are deeply offensive to me and to everything I stand for. According to court documents, Abdul immediately reported the assault by Lythgoe, an American Idol producer at the time, to her representatives but did not take action for fear of losing her job, the lawsuit said. Moreover, Abduls contracts prohibited her from speaking out, the lawsuit said. Another alleged assault took place years later when Abdul worked as a judge on So You Think You Can Dance, according to court documents. The star, 61, enjoyed renewed popularity in the early 2000s starring as a judge on talent TV series. The lawsuit alleges Lythgoe, 74, assaulted her on the couch of his Los Angeles home after a work dinner. Abdul again firmly rejected him and immediately left Lythgoes home, court documents said. In the lawsuit, Abdul levels other allegations at the entertainment industry mogul, including that Lythgoe once called to taunt her and said it had been seven years and the statute of limitations had run on the alleged assaults. The lawsuit alleged that the star also witnessed Lythgoe assault one of her assistants on So You Think You Can Dance. The lawsuit was submitted days before the Dec. 31 filing deadline established under the Californias Sexual Abuse and Cover-Up Accountability Act. The legislation allows individuals to bring certain sexual abuse lawsuits that would otherwise have fallen outside the statute of limitations. Source  Reuters --Agencies",

        "content": "Indias space agency successfully launched a rocket Monday from Sriharikota spaceport to help scientists improve their knowledge of black holes. 2024 lifted off majestically, the Indian Space Research Organization wrote Monday in a post on X, formerly Twitter. XPoSat health is normal. Power generation has commenced. The launch is only the second mission to focus on studying black holes, after NASA launched a similar mission in 2021. A black hole is an area in space where matter has collapsed on itself with gravitational pull so strong that not even light can escape. ISRO will conduct its research on black holes using the X-ray Polarimeter Satellite, or XPoSat, which was deployed during Mondays launch. ISRO chief S Somanath said the PSLV-C58 vehicle placed the satellite into its intended orbit, which he described as excellent. From this point, the orbit of the PSLV will be reduced to a lower orbit, where the upper stage of the PSLV, which is now described as POEM, will carry out experiments with nine of the onboard payloads and that will take some time, Somanath said Monday. During 2023, India launched its first solar mission, Aditya-L1, and celebrated the successful soft landing of Chandrayaan-3 on the south pole of the moon. Since its August landing, Pragyan lunar rover has demonstrated its ability to navigate craters on the moons surface. ISRO is currently working to launch a manned mission by 2025, with the goal of sending three astronauts into low-Earth orbit and bring them back after three days. 2024 is going to be the year for Gaganyaan readiness, Somanath said.

Hence, I believe that we will be able to provide fertilizers to the farmers at current rates at the next Yala season. The minister pointed out that raising the prices of Urea, Muriate of Potash (MOP) and Triple Superphosphate (TSP), currently sold in the local market, by adding the VAT is unnecessary.

        "date": "January 2, 2024 06:36 pm",
        "content": "Health Minister Dr. Ramesh Pathirana has ensured that the Ministry is closely monitoring the emergence of the novel COVID-19 sub-variant JN1 reported from India. While acknowledging that no cases have been reported from the sample tests conducted thus far, Pathirana urged the public to adhere to the health practices established during the previous waves of COVID-19. Furthermore, the Minister announced that preparations have been finalized for a vaccination program aimed at controlling the resurgence of the measles disease across the country. Accordingly, the programme is scheduled to commence next week and will be administered through the Medical Officer of Health (MOH) Offices nationwide. Speaking during a press conference held at the Presidential Media Center today (02 Jan.) under the theme Collective Path to a Stable Country, the Minister further said: The ongoing initiative to provide quality and advanced medicines to the people of Sri Lanka under the free health service is being consistently implemented. The country experienced a shortage of certain medicines due to the economic downturn after the Covid crisis. However, with the steady improvement of the countrys financial situation, the government has expedited the procurement process to obtain essential medicines. To enhance transparency in the procurement of medicines for hospitals, preparations are underway to digitize procurement activities. Expert advice is being sought from the computer science departments of the University of Colombo and University of Moratuwa. This digitization effort is expected to streamline future procurement activities. President Ranil Wickremesinghe has allocated the necessary funds in this years budget to improve the quality control laboratory of the NMRA. Structural changes in capacity and human resources are anticipated this year. Identification of 850 types of essential medicines required for the country has been completed. These medicines cover a wide range, including those vital for saving lives, contact lenses, surgical equipment for heart patients (including stents), orthopedic surgery equipment and other medical necessities. The alarming number of 50 deaths from dengue disease last year underscores the need for collective action from society. The government, with the support of the entire community, is implementing an environment cleaning program involving members of the security forces. Dengue can be controlled by maintaining a clean environment. Although Sri Lanka has been recognized by the World Health Organization (WHO) for eradicating measles, the Ministry of Health acknowledges around 700 reported cases last year. Certain deficiencies in peoples existing immunity may have contributed to this situation. Starting from the second week of January, arrangements have been made to provide the measles immunization vaccine through all Medical Officer of Health offices nationwide. Parents are urged to ensure their children receive the necessary immunization and if necessary, individuals can receive this vaccine as an additional dose. Amidst discussions about the new JN.1 Covid strain reported from India, the Ministry of Health reassures the public that, as currently reported by the World Health Organization, there is no undue cause for concern. Continuous monitoring is being carried out and with the support of the Medical Research Institute, extensive sample tests have been initiated. To date, no patients with the new Covid variant have been identified. Nevertheless, the public is advised to adhere to the health practices followed during the last pandemic season.",

        "content": "A group of Rohingya refugees living in Sri Lanka staged a protest outside the office of the U.N. refugee agency Tuesday, saying they fear losing their living allowance once the agencys office in the island nation closes at the end of this year. The protesters also want to be resettled in another country because Sri Lanka does not allow them to live there permanently. About 100 Rohingya refugees live in Sri Lanka, most of them rescued at sea by the navy while they were trying to reach Indonesia after fleeing Myanmar for Bangladesh. About 740,000 Rohingya were resettled in Bangladesh after fleeing their homes in Myanmar to escape a brutal counterinsurgency campaign by security forces. But the camps in Bangladesh are squalid, with surging gang violence and rampant hunger, leading many to flee again. Ruki Fernando, a rights activist in Sri Lanka, said the refugees receive basic allowance from the U.N. agency and are provided with limited health care by the Sri Lankan government. However, the refugee children dont receive education and adults arent allowed to work. We didnt intend to come to Sri Lanka, but were rescued off the seas in Sri Lanka and brought to Sri Lanka by the navy. We also had to endure a hard time in detention in Sri Lanka and still live a very hard life in a new country where we cant speak our language, and many dont have family members, relatives and friends, the refugees said in a petition to the U.N. agencys representative. The petition said the refugees were upset to learn of the offices upcoming closure and pleaded for it to help us find a permanent solution in another country that will help us overcome uncertainty and not make us and our children permanently stateless. The U.N. refugee agency could not immediately be reached Tuesday. The office in Sri Lanka was especially active during the countrys quarter-century civil war which ended in 2009.

        "date": "January 2, 2024 11:22 pm",
        "content": "Rescue efforts continue in Japan after 55 people were killed in a powerful earthquake that hit the country on New Years Day. Homes collapsed, buildings caught fire and roads were extensively damaged, hindering the work of rescue services. The epicentre of the 7.6 quake was the Noto peninsula, in central Japan. The Japanese Prime Minister, Fumio Kishida, said emergency services were locked in a race against time to rescue survivors. On Tuesday, Mr Kishida also said some 3,000 rescuers were trying to reach parts of the Noto peninsula. Helicopter surveys showed many fires and widespread damage to buildings and infrastructure. The city of Wajima, on the northern tip of Noto, has been cut off from land routes. The Japanese military has been handing out supplies including food, water and blankets for those who have had to vacate their homes. The countrys government has said that 57,360 people had to be evacuated. Tens of thousands of meals are being delivered across the affected region. Aftershocks continued throughout Monday and Tuesday. Japans chief cabinet secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi warned people to be alert for more earthquakes of an intensity of up to 7 in the coming week. Ishikawa, 155km (96.3 miles) south of the Noto peninsula, experienced a 4.9 quake on Tuesday afternoon. The major tsunami warnings put out by the Japanese government on Monday were later downgraded. By Tuesday, all tsunami advisories were lifted along the Sea of Japan, meaning there was no longer a risk of such an event. Residents of the affected area of Japan have been sharing their experiences of the quake, which lasted several minutes. An 82-year-old resident of Nanao, Toshio Iwahama, told the BBC that his wooden home had partially collapsed. He said that despite living through multiple earthquakes, he had never experienced tremors of this magnitude. Briton Emma Ward, 41, who was on a skiing holiday in the resort village of Hakuba, said the quake had hit without warning, prompting her group to take shelter under a table in a café. She told the BBC that the intensity of the tremors caused people to flee the building entirely, she said. The worst part during the earthquake was not knowing how intense it was going to become. Its a very frightening experience, Ms Ward said. Many also said the quake reminded them of the devastating 2011 earthquake and tsunami that killed 18,000 people and triggered an accident at a nuclear plant in Fukushima. In an incident unrelated to the earthquake, a Japan Airlines plane caught fire on Tuesday as it collided with a coastguard aircraft on its way to provide earthquake relief at Tokyos Haneda airport. Five people on board the coastguard plane are known to have died, but the Japan Airlines planes 379 passengers and crew managed to escape. Japan is one of the most seismically active nations on Earth, owing to its location on the so-called Pacific Ring of Fire, where many tectonic plates meet. The constant threat of earthquakes has led Japan to develop one of the worlds most sophisticated tsunami warning systems. Source: BBC -Agencies",

        "date": "January 3, 2024 09:55 am",
        "content": "An apparent Israeli strike in the Lebanese capital of Beirut killed Hamas No. 2 political leader Tuesday, marking a potentially significant escalation of Israels war against the militant group and heightening the risk of a wider Middle East conflict. Saleh Arouri, who was the most senior Hamas figure killed since the war with Israel began, was also a founder of the groups military wing. His death could provoke major retaliation by Lebanons powerful Hezbollah militia. The strike hit an apartment in a building in a Shiite district of Beirut that is a Hezbollah stronghold, and Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah has vowed to strike back against any Israeli targeting of Palestinian officials in Lebanon. Hezbollah and the Israeli military have been exchanging fire almost daily over the Israeli-Lebanese border since Israels military campaign in Gaza began nearly three months ago. But so far the Lebanese group has appeared reluctant to dramatically escalate the fighting. A significant response now could send the conflict spiraling into all-out war on Israels northern border. Lebanons state-run National News Agency said the strike was carried out by an Israeli drone, and Israeli officials declined to comment. Speaking to reporters, Israeli military spokesman Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari did not directly mention Arouris death but said, We are focused and remain focused on fighting against Hamas. We are on high readiness for any scenario, he added. The killing comes ahead of a visit to the region by U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, even as the United States has tried to prevent a spread of the conflict, repeatedly warning Hezbollah  and its regional supporter, Iran  not to escalate the violence. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to press ahead with the assault in Gaza until Hamas is crushed and the more than 100 hostages still held by the militant group in Gaza are freed, which he has said could take several more months. At the same time, Israeli officials have increasingly warned in recent days of stepped-up action against Hezbollah unless its cross-border fire stops. BEIRUT STRIKE Netanyahu and other Israeli officials have repeatedly threatened to kill Hamas leaders wherever they are. The groups Oct. 7 attack from Gaza into southern Israel killed around 1,200 people, and some 240 others were taken hostage. Israel claims to have killed a number of mid-level Hamas leaders in Gaza, but this would be the first time it has reached into another country to target the groups top leaders, many of whom live in exile around the region. Arouri was the deputy of Hamas supreme political leader, Ismail Haniyeh, and headed the groups presence in the West Bank. He was also a key liaison with Hezbollah. Tuesdays blast shook a residential building in the Beirut suburb of Musharafieh, killing four people, according to the Lebanese news agency. Hamas confirmed that Arouri was killed along with six other members of the group, including two military commanders. Haniyeh said the movement was more powerful and determined following the attack. They left behind them strong men who will carry the banner after them, he said of those killed. Hezbollah called the strike a serious attack on Lebanon, its people, its security, sovereignty and resistance. We affirm that this crime will never pass without response and punishment, it said. Since the Gaza conflict began, Lebanese have feared their country could be pulled into a full-fledged war. Hezbollah and Israel fought a monthlong war in 2006, when Israeli bombardment wreaked heavy destruction in southern Lebanon. GAZA COMBAT CONTINUES Israels air, ground and sea assault in Gaza has killed more than 22,100 people in Gaza, two-thirds of them women and children, according to the Health Ministry in the Hamas-ruled territory. The count does not differentiate between civilians and combatants. The campaign has driven some 85 of Gazas population from their homes, forcing hundreds of thousands of people into overcrowded shelters or teeming tent camps in Israeli-designated safe areas that the military has nevertheless bombed. Israels siege of the territory has left a quarter of Gaza residents facing starvation, according to the United Nations. Israel announced Monday that it would withdraw five brigades, or several thousand troops, from Gaza in the coming weeks. Still, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said it would be a mistake to think that Israel is planning on halting the war. The feeling that we will stop soon is incorrect, he said Tuesday. Without a clear victory, we will not be able to live in the Middle East. Israel has said its close to achieving operational control over most of northern Gaza, where ground troops have been battling militants for over two months. But Gallant said several thousand Hamas fighters are believed still to be in the north, and residents reported clashes in several parts of Gaza City, as well as in the nearby urban Jabaliya refugee camp. Fierce fighting has continued in other parts of the Palestinian territory, especially the south, where many of Hamas forces remain intact and where most of Gazas population has fled. Palestinians reported heavy airstrikes and artillery shelling in the southern city of Khan Younis and farming areas to the east. The Palestinian Red Crescent said Israel bombed its headquarters in the city, killing five people. At least 14,000 displaced people are sheltering in the building, it said. Fighting was also underway in and around the built-up Bureij refugee camp in central Gaza. The army issued evacuation orders to people living in parts of nearby Nuseirat camp. A strike Tuesday leveled a building in Nuseirat, killing at least eight people, according to officials at the nearby hospital. Associated Press footage showed people pulling several children out of the wreckage. GENOCIDE CASE In other developments, officials said Israel will defend itself before the United Nations top court against charges that it has engaged in genocide of Palestinians in Gaza. The announcement set the stage for what is likely to be a landmark case in international law. South Africa launched the case Friday at the International Court of Justice at The Hague, Netherlands, saying the Israeli military campaign targeting Hamas has resulted in enough death, destruction and humanitarian crisis in Gaza to meet the threshold of genocide under international law. South Africa asked the court to order Israel to halt its attacks in Gaza. Israel rarely cooperates in international court cases against it, dismissing the United Nations and international tribunals as unfair and biased. Its decision to respond to the charge signals that the government is concerned about potential damage to its reputation. The genocide charge strikes at the heart of Israels national identity. The country sees itself as a bulwark of security for Jews after the Holocaust killed 6 million Jews, and world support for Israels creation in Palestine in 1948 was deeply rooted in outrage over Nazi atrocities. The convention against genocide was drawn up by world powers the same year in hopes of preventing similar atrocities. Eylon Levy, an official in the Israeli prime ministers office, accused South Africa of giving political and legal cover to Hamas after its Oct. 7 attack triggered Israels campaign. The state of Israel will appear before the International Court of Justice at the Hague to dispel South Africas absurd blood libel, he said. Many South Africans, including President Cyril Ramaphosa, have compared Israels policies regarding Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank with South Africas past apartheid regime of racial segregation. Israel rejects such comparisons. Source: Associated Press -Agencies",

Therefore, all exam applicants are advised not to use the previous exam timetable, he said, pointing out that some websites may display this schedule incorrectly. He also said that the amended timetable is indicated in the examination admission card provided to the applicants, for their convenience. So there is no need to go to any other source of information. There is a separate section on your admission paper. In that section, the date and time slots for each subject, the subject number and the medium of instruction have been mentioned. That is enough. You dont need to search for anything else about the timetable, he added. Meanwhile, the Exams Commissioner General assured that a special program is being implemented to arrange alternative examination centres for the candidates sitting for the exam in disaster-prone areas, while giving priority to Anuradhapura, Kekirawa, Polonnaruwa, Passara, Ampara, Batticaloa and Hasalaka. He further informed the students to seek assistance by contacting the nearest Zonal Education Office or the Disaster Management Units to reach the examination centres if they are experiencing any difficulties in arriving on time due to the prevailing inclement weather.",

Pastor Jerome, arrested by the Criminal Investigation Department (CID), secured his release on a cash bail of Rs. 500,000 and two personal bails of Rs. 10 million each, as per the court order issued by Colombo Fort Magistrate Thilina Gamage. Despite being granted bail, the court imposed travel restrictions on Pastor Jerome, prohibiting him from leaving the country, and the strict condition that he refrain from making any such statements in the future that could disturb religious harmony. The controversial pastor was arrested on 01 December after a video of one of his sermons, containing alleged derogatory statements, went viral on social media. Pastor Jerome had initially provided a statement to the CID on 30 November for around eight hours. Subsequently, the Court of Appeal issued an interim order on 17 November, directing the CID not to arrest him upon his arrival in Sri Lanka. The order also mandated Pastor Fernando to record a statement with the CIDs Cyber Crime Investigation Division within 48 hours of his return. After months of controversy over his remarks, Fernando returned to the island on Wednesday morning (29 Nov.). He had arrived from Singapore on board a Qatar Airlines flight and left the airport through the Gold Route at the Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) in Katunayake.",

        "date": "January 3, 2024 11:58 am",
        "content": "South Koreas opposition Democratic Party leader Lee Jae-myung remained hospitalised in intensive care on Wednesday, a day after a knife attack on him shocked political leaders who were vying for the upper hand in a major election three months away. Surgeons operated on Lee for more than two hours late on Wednesday to repair a major blood vessel in his neck that was sliced when an assailant lunged and stabbed him with a knife. The act of terror against Chairman Lee Jae-myung was clearly a challenge against democracy and a threat against democracy, Democratic Party floor leader Hong Ik-pyo said at a party leadership council meeting. He urged a speedy investigation and tougher security for high-profile political figures, echoing renewed questions about the safety on campaign trails in a country with a history of political violence despite tight restrictions on gun ownership. Jin Jeong-hwa, a party supporter who was a witness at the scene of the stabbing, said the incident clearly showed the need for stronger and professional security protection for political leaders, not simply police who are deployed to monitor. People like opposition leaders really need a dedicated security detail, Jin said in an interview with Reuters. He added it was clear from his experience at political events that Lee was very much exposed to personal safety threats. Lee, a tough talking progressive who narrowly lost the 2022 presidential election, had been rallying the party to retain the parliamentary majority it holds against President Yoon Suk Yeols conservatives. South Korea holds a pivotal election on April 10 where the conservatives will try to win back a majority for the first time since 2016 and help Yoons pro-business policies including tax cuts, deregulation and social reforms. The attack against Lee, which unfolded quickly but was widely captured in footage of the outdoors public event, shocked his party and his rivals alike, who condemned all violence against political figures. Yoon again condemned the attack as terror and said: It is an enemy of liberal democracy, according to his office. He wished Lee a speedy recovery, it said. Lee was airlifted from Busan, where the attack occurred, to Seoul on Tuesday where he received surgery to reconstruct the jugular vein that pumps blood from the head back to the heart and insert a tube to support the damaged vessel. He was conscious and recovering in the intensive care unit, party officials said. The suspect, who was quickly subdued by party members and police officers at the scene, was a man born in 1957 from the central region who may have been in Busan for days, planning the attack with an 18-cm (7-inch) camping knife, police and news reports said. The leader of the conservative People Power Party scaled back scheduled public events, and both parties urged members to refrain from comments that could inflame voters as Lee recuperates. Lee lost to Yoon by less than 1 point of votes, the narrowest margin, in a bitterly fought presidential election and has since faced bribery allegations stemming from a development project when he was mayor of a city near Seoul. He denies wrongdoing. Source: Reuters -Agencies",

        "date": "January 3, 2024 12:04 pm",
        "content": "Chinese company BYD sold more electric vehicles than Elon Musks Tesla in the last three months of 2023 as the two battled for top spot in the sector. BYD said on Monday it had sold a record 526,000 battery-only vehicles in the final quarter of 2023. It marked the first quarter its battery-only sales have outpaced Teslas. The US-based firm has seen demand slow as borrowing costs climb. However, for the whole of 2023, Mr Musks Tesla still sold more. On Tuesday, Tesla said it delivered a record 484,500 electric vehicles in the last three months of 2023 and 1.8 million for the year as a whole. The end-of-year performance was better than analysts had expected, as sales rose 20 from the same period in 2022 and picked up pace from earlier in 2023. Analyst Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities described the quarter as a clear win for Tesla. But it fell short of earlier hopes. Last January, Mr Musk said that Tesla had the potential to achieve two million deliveries in 2023. The firm cut prices repeatedly to try to woo buyers. The milestone achieved by BYD is a reminder of the challenges facing the firm, which helped to launch the electric vehicle industry. As BYD has accelerated into the fast lane, its fresh evidence of just how competitive the EV market has become and how hard it will be for Tesla to swerve back to head the pack, said Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown. For the year as a whole, Shenzen-based BYD sold more than 3 million so-called-new energy vehicles (NEVs), which includes battery-only vehicles and hybrids. Almost 1.6 million of its total sales were battery-only vehicles, the firm said. BYDs chief executive Wang Chuanfu co-founded BYD with his cousin in Shenzhen in 1995. The company made a name for itself as a manufacturer of rechargeable batteries - used in smartphones, laptops and other electronics - that competed with pricier Japanese imports. It started selling its shares on the stock market in 2002 and diversified by purchasing a struggling state-owned car manufacturer, Qinchuan Automobile Company. Since 2008 BYD has counted veteran US investor Warren Buffetts Berkshire Hathaway as a shareholder. Analysts say BYD owes its growth to its original business - batteries. They are among the most expensive parts of an EV and making them in-house saves BYD a lot of money. Many of BYDs competitors rely on third-party manufacturers for batteries. BYDs battery business helped to give it flexibility to cut prices sharply at the end of 2023, lifting sales, which jumped by 70 in December alone. Source: BBC --Agencies",

        "title": "Disney cedes global market share crown to Universal",
        "date": "January 3, 2024 04:21 pm",
        "content": "Universals film empire is taking a major bow after placing No. 1 in marketshare at the 2023 global box office, a feat no studio has been able to pull off since Disney rose to dominance in 2016. The 24 movies released by Universal generated an estimated 4.91 billion in worldwide ticket sales, compared to an estimated 4.83 billion from the 17 titles released by Disney in what made for a relatively close race both in North America and at the foreign box office. Even a week ago, no one in Hollywood was sure Universal would prevail, especially overseas. Universals total haul included 1.94 billion in domestic revenue, while Disneys domestic tally was 1.9 billion. Internationally, Universal prevailed with 2.97 billion. Disneys offshore revenue was 2.92 billion. The transfer of power is a big win for Donna Langley, who is chairman of NBCUniversal Studio Group and chief content officer. She is known for her close ties to top filmmakers, and had the necessary skills and standing to lure Christopher Nolan into the Universal fold when he grew upset with Warner Bros. after it announced plans to release its 2021 slate day-and-date on streaming. Nolans R-rated Oppenheimer led Universals top-grossing films of 2023 with an astonishing 952 million in global ticket sales, a record sum for a biographical drama and Nolans best showing outside of his two Dark Knight movies, not adjusted for inflation. Universal seems to have found the perfect balance of franchise films, animation, horror and everything in between  and these assets are given every possible advantage with a pitch perfect strategy that combines great filmmaker relationships, fantastic marketing and a rock solid distribution plan, says Comscore chief box office analyst Paul Dergarabedian. Universals slate includes titles from Universal Pictures proper, specialty division Focus Features, Illumination and DreamWorks Animation. Illumination is home of Super Mario, which earned 1.36 billion globally (it ranked No. 2 for the year behind Warners Barbie). The film shattered numerous records, including becoming the No. 2 animated film of all time behind Disneys Frozen. And 2023s Fast X delivered 704.9 million in box office grosses to give Universal three of the five top-grossing films of the year globally. Langley, who also keeps Blumhouse CEO Jason Blum close, has always insisted on a diverse slate of films in addition to franchise fare. Blumhouses Five Nights at Freddys scared up 290.9 million against a mere 20 million budget. In 2023, Universal once again found success at the box office with our eclectic slate of films. Our slate featured blockbusters like Christopher Nolans epic Oppenheimer and Illuminations record-breaking The Super Mario Bros. Movie, horror hits including Blumhouses breakout hit M3GAN, comedies, dramas, and family films from two of the biggest names in animation, Illumination and DreamWorks Animation, Jim Orr, Universal Pictures president of domestic distribution, said in a statement. From 2016 to 2022, Disney placed first in global marketshare (it lost the domestic race to Sony in 2020, the year of the COVID-19 box office collapse). Universal hasnt ranked No. 1 on a worldwide basis since 2015, when the studios revenue reached a then-record 6.9 billion. Ceding the crown to Universal caps an especially difficult year for Disney, one in which Marvel Studios and the companys animation studios stumbled badly. In recent weeks as The Marvels and Wish collapsed in their box office runs, Disney CEO Bob Iger didnt try to gloss over the missteps. We lost focus, the exec declared on a Nov.8 earnings call, where he promised investors that the company is putting effort into quality versus quantity. If theres any solace, its that the marketshare contest wasnt a rout, and that Disney  like Universal  was far ahead of the other major studios. And it has ranked as one of the top two studios for the past nine years, including seven at No. 1. Being the No. 1 studio globally for seven consecutive years out of the last eight is pretty remarkable by any measure and is something of which we are all incredibly proud, Disney chief of global distribution Tony Chambers says. Other highlights: Disney released four of the top 10-grossing films globally in 2023, the most of any studio; Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (one of the few superhero titles to work), The Little Mermaid, Elemental and Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania. Domestically, Disney claimed three of the top 10 films, likewise the most of any studio; Guardians, Little Mermaid and Quantumania. Warner Bros.  home of Barbie, the years top earner with 1.44 billion in worldwide ticket sales  was No. 3 in global marketshare with 3.84 billion, including 1.43 billion domestically and 2.4 billion overseas. Sony came in No. 4 with 2.09 billion globally, including an early domestic estimate of 1.01 billion and 1.08 overseas. Paramounts global revenue came in at 2.03 billion in 2023, including 842 million domestically and 1.18 billion offshore. Elsewhere, Lionsgate had a notable milestone to celebrate in that its movies generated north of 1 billion in global ticket sales for the first time in five years thanks to the successful runs of John Wick: Chapter 4, The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes and the latest Saw franchise, among other titles. John Wick was a standout in particular, earning 440.1 million worldwide and north of 187 million domestically, the ninth-best showing of the year. Source - The Hollywood Reporter --Agencies",

        "date": "January 3, 2024 04:47 pm",
        "content": "The United Nations Assistant Secretary General says the key factor in broadening Sri Lankas tax base and increasing the number of taxpayers is to simplify the registration process for taxpayers. During a brief discussion held with Finance State Minister Shehan Semasinghe this morning (Jan.03), Ms. Kanni Wignaraja, the UN Assistant Secretary General and UNDP Regional Director, highlighted that it is imperative to digitalize the taxpayer registration process to improve voluntary tax compliance. Ensuring that every person who obtains a Tax Identification Number (TIN) is not liable for income tax will encourage members of the public to expeditiously register to secure a TIN, Ms. Wignaraja continued. The UN Assistant Secretary General said Sri Lanka should take note of the tax policy reforms followed by Bangladesh, which was once labelled as a country plagued with corruption, to boost its tax revenue. Digital transformation and expansion of the tax system to regional levels helped Bangladeshs National Revenue Board to become more a productive and efficient institution, she explained. In a similar vein, the Sri Lankan government is also making efforts to digitalize the tax system by incorporating District Secretariats, State Minister Semasinghe noted. Further, the lawmaker pointed out that no specific group can be given relief at the moment as the country is in the middle of a rigorous reform process. Speaking on the debt restructuring process, State Minister Semasinghe said Sri Lanka remains extremely grateful for the assistance provided by global agencies. The two sides also discussed the ongoing social dialogue on the Value-Added Tax VAT). Attention was also paid to further educating the general public on the new VAT hike, taxpayer registration, and TIN registration, as well as the services and goods exempted from VAT.",

        "content": "A progress review meeting was convened at the Presidential Secretariat, chaired by President Ranil Wickremesinghe, to assess the effectiveness of the dengue control programs in the Western and Central Provinces. Under the guidance of the Presidents Office, and in adherence to existing health guidelines, collaborative efforts involving the armed forces and police have successfully curtailed the spread of dengue in these regions. The discussion revealed that the implementation of various dengue control and awareness programs, particularly focusing on Medical Officer of Health (MoH) divisions, has effectively brought the situation under control. During the meeting, it was acknowledged that while the spread of dengue has been contained in the Western and Central Provinces, attention should now be directed towards districts such as Jaffna, Trincomalee and Batticaloa. Specific areas with a high incidence of dengue around government institutions, schools, religious sites, public spaces and private institutions were identified for targeted interventions. President Ranil Wickremesinghe commended the on-going efforts to control the spread of dengue across the country through the implementation of diverse programs. To combat the spread of dengue, a decision was made to establish an operational unit directly supervised by the Ministry of Health. The Health Ministry Secretary chaired a special meeting on the matter today (03), with the participation of the heads of the three armed forces and the Acting Police Inspector. The objective is to create a reporting system for ongoing dengue control programs, tracking daily progress in the province and outlining future measures. The participants included State Minister of Health Dr. Sita Arambepola, Presidential Senior Adviser on National Security and Chief of Presidential Staff Mr. Sagala Ratnayaka, along with officials from various organizations such as the Colombo Municipal Council, the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Health. The Central Provincial Health Authorities also joined the discussion through Zoom technology.",

The State Minister asserted, however, that such measures are not intended to impose an extra burden on the populace. Although it is mandatory to open a tax file and obtain a TIN, this does not imply that all those who have registered for a TIN have to pay tax. Currently, only those people who earn a total monthly income of over Rs. 100,000 have to pay tax, he said in this regard.",

        "content": "Two explosions caused by terrorist attacks killed more than 70 people and wounded scores at a ceremony in Iran to commemorate top commander Qassem Soleimani who was killed in a 2020 U.S. drone attack, Iranian officials said on Wednesday. Iranian state television reported a first and then a second explosion during an anniversary event at the cemetery where Soleimani is buried in the southeastern city of Kerman. The blasts were caused by terrorist attacks, state media quoted a local official in the Kerman province as saying. Babak Yektaparast, a spokesperson for Irans emergency services, was reported later as saying 73 people had been killed and 170 injured. The semi-official Nournews had said earlier that several gas canisters exploded on the road leading to the cemetery. State TV showed Red Crescent rescuers attending to wounded people at the ceremony, where hundreds of Iranians had gathered to mark the anniversary of Soleimanis death. Some Iranian news agencies said the number of wounded people was much higher. Our rapid response teams are evacuating the injured... But there are waves of crowds blocking roads, Reza Fallah, head of the Kerman province Red Crescent told state TV. The blasts struck an event marking the the fourth anniversary of the killing of Gen. Qassim Soleimani, the head of the Revolutionary Guards elite Quds Force, who died in a U.S. drone strike in Iraq in January 2020. State TV said two explosions were heard near Soleimanis burial place Wednesday afternoon. It gave no details on what caused the explosion. State TV said several people were injured in a stampede after the explosions. It said groups were deployed to the scene. The live broadcast had showed thousands of mourners participating in the death anniversary, with ambulances on site. Soleimani was the architect of Irans regional military activities and is hailed as a national icon among supporters of Irans theocracy. Source: APReuters --Agencies",

        "content": "Trade, Commerce and Food Security Minister Nalin Fernando pledges a significant reduction of 75 in the cost of living burden on the people by the end of the first quarter this year. He attributes this positive outlook to the initiation of 2024 with a positive economic growth rate. Minister Fernando expressed his commitment to enhancing consumer rights by introducing a new program for the Consumer Authority, aiming to provide greater security for consumers. The Ministers remarks were made during a press conference at the Presidential Media Center (PMC) today (03) under the theme Collective Path to a Stable Country. He acknowledged the impact of Indias halt on big onion exports, which has reverberated in Sri Lanka. However, the minister assured that the situation will be sort within the next two weeks when India relaxes its restrictions on onion exports. Minister Nalin Fernando further commented: We embark on the year 2024 with a positive economic growth rate. Notably, by the end of the first quarter, the cost of living burden on the people is projected to decrease by 75. The existing tax policy assures continued relief for citizens in the future. While some argue against levying taxes for government income, it must be emphasized that such statements are counterproductive to the countrys economic growth. Citizens bear the responsibility of supporting government investments in the countrys future using tax revenue. Critics often cite high taxes as a reason for leaving the country. However, taxation in our country stands at a modest 12, significantly lower than the 38 to 43 in countries attracting emigrants. These nations have thrived due to their tax policies. The interruption in big onion exports from India has impacted our country, but resolution is expected within the next two weeks when India relaxes export restrictions. Improper publicity surrounding tax amendments, including VAT, has led to unwarranted price hikes by intermediaries and some companies, placing pressure on the people. In the first quarter of 2024, Lanka Sathosa aims to open five new mega stores and ten regular Lanka Sathosa stores. By year end, the plan is to expand the Lanka Sathosa outlet network to 500 outlets. Expanding the network to 500 outlets serves the primary goal of enabling consumers to purchase goods at government subsidized prices without shortages. In 2024, the goal is to increase the total income of Lanka Sathosa Company to nearly Rs. 70 billion, achieving an operating profit of nearly Rs. 1.5 billion. The company aims to secure a net profit of Rs. 500 million amidst the economic challenges. A new program for the consumer authority is anticipated in 2024, aiming to enhance consumer rights. The Department of Measurement Units, Standards and Services will be fully computerized to meet peoples needs in the first four months of the year.",

        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe emphasized that the nation cannot revert to a period marked by scarcity of fuel, lack of fertilizers, and economic collapse. The President further asserted that despite the challenges, the countrys economy can experience swift strengthening by persisting on the current trajectory, acknowledging the inherent difficulties. In his address at the Shilpa Abhimani 2023 Presidential Handicraft Awards ceremony held at the Sirimavo Bandaranaike Memorial Exhibition Centre in Colombo today (03), President Ranil Wickremesinghe underscored that making incorrect economic decisions could exacerbate the devaluation of the Rupee. He emphasized his steadfast commitment to avoid compromising the nations future by succumbing to popular decisions that might have adverse consequences. The President affirmed his dedication to offering comprehensive relief to the public in times of adversity. He further declared that the government would extend every necessary support to transform the handicraft industry into a sector contributing significantly to foreign exchange earnings. The National Crafts Council annually organizes the Shilpa Abhimani National Handicrafts Competition and Exhibition with the objective of preserving and promoting traditional and culturally significant handicrafts. This initiative also seeks to foster social appreciation and contribute to the economic empowerment of craftsmen. The Shilpa Abhimani 2023 National Handicraft Competition, held this year, was conducted under the auspices of the Small and Medium Enterprises Development Division and the Ministry of Industries. This competition showcased the craftsmanship from 66 sub-fields under 31 fundamental handicraft categories. The designs submitted underwent a meticulous selection process, overseen by a qualified jury comprising university professors. The laureates of the Shilpa Abhimani 2023 National Handicraft Competition received prestigious recognition through Gold and Silver Awards, while cash prizes were bestowed upon those securing the first, second and third places. President Ranil Wickremesinghe presented the prize money, certificates and trophies to the accomplished artisans including the two winners of the World Craft Council Tournament 2023 who earned the distinguished Gold Awards. A special commemorative gift was presented to President Ranil Wickremesinghe. Additionally, the President visited to observe the winning designs in the Shilpa Abhimani 2023 design competition and expressed appreciation for the talents of the winning artists. President Wickremesinghe further commented: In 2023, individuals showcasing exceptional talent in the field of handicrafts were acknowledged and honoured with awards. The award ceremony, which had been hindered by the countrys prevailing conditions in recent years, successfully took place. Despite the challenges, the remarkable skills of the artists are evident throughout the current exhibition. It is imperative to channel these talents towards the development of the handicraft sector. Beyond embracing Sri Lankan styles, there should be an effort to incorporate influences from Western styles, as successfully demonstrated by India. Learning from their approach could be beneficial. The implementation of such programs is anticipated to contribute significantly to the countrys income. The primary focus should be on the export sector, as steering away from the challenges faced by the export industry is a significant undertaking for the country at present. Recognizing this, it is crucial to acknowledge that the government is prepared to offer essential support for the advancement of the handicraft sector. This support aims to facilitate the acquisition of foreign technological knowledge and the overall development of the sectors capabilities. Despite enduring a challenging period, the government has managed to increase the countrys income. Credit goes to the minister, the state minister and all involved for their commendable efforts. In 2022, our countrys economy was in a state of collapse, exacerbated by a decline in tourist arrivals. Notably, the handicraft sector is intricately linked to the tourism industry. To safeguard and revitalize the economy, necessary steps were taken, including seeking support from the International Monetary Fund (IMF). This opportunity allowed to reorganize the economic framework for the betterment of the nation. Recognizing our inability to meet debt obligations in 2022, we entered into negotiations with the IMF to chart a sustainable path forward. This necessitated the transformation of all loss-making sectors into profitable ones and the reduction of certain concessions. As a result of these measures, we observed economic progress in the third and fourth quarters of the previous year. The current focus is on building upon this momentum, encompassing the last two quarters of the preceding year and the four quarters of the current year. The objective is to achieve a positive economic growth of 2 this year, with the potential to further increase it to 5 in the subsequent year. A collaborative and harmonious approach is crucial for navigating this economic growth trajectory. A significant challenge we confronted was the continuous practice of printing money and reliance on bank loans, which led to a depreciation of the Rupee. The government had previously incurred substantial debt from banks, causing the collapse of two state banks. To address these issues, an agreement was reached with the International Monetary Fund, committing to abstain from taking loans from banks and refraining from printing money. To bolster the governments income, we aim to achieve a revenue equivalent to 12 of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) this year, with an ultimate target of 15. This increased income is pivotal for our economic advancement. Given the constraints of not being able to print money or secure loans from banks, the primary avenue to bolster government revenue became evident. Consequently, the Value Added Tax (VAT) was raised from 15 to 18, and various goods previously exempted from VAT were brought under its purview. These measures, albeit challenging, are essential for generating the necessary income, ultimately strengthening the rupee. We acknowledge that such adjustments may pose difficulties for everyone, but it is the path we must undertake to secure our economic future. If these actions are not taken, our prospects become uncertain. Despite these challenges, the commitment to providing relief to the people remains steadfast. Initiatives such as providing a Rs.10,000 allowance to government employees, tripling unemployment benefits and offering free land deeds have been implemented. Further relief measures are anticipated in the future as we navigate these economic challenges collectively. The path we are currently taking is the only viable option. Some may suggest printing money and obtaining bank loans, but such measures would jeopardize our support from the IMF. Despite the challenges we face along this path, there is a positive outlook for the strengthening of the rupee by the end of the year, with its value increasing progressively. Preserving the value of the rupee is crucial. While providing concessions, we must avoid devaluing the currency, as that would have detrimental consequences. Admittedly, this may not be a popular program, but it is the only pragmatic option available. If there are alternative programs for economic recovery, they should be presented, accompanied by a clear strategy on how to garner the support of the IMF. We cannot afford to revert to an era marked by shortages of fuel, fertilizer and a collapsed economy. This reality underscores the urgency of finding sustainable solutions for the well-being of the country. Despite the challenges, the country is experiencing development, with notable progress observed in tourism last year. Efforts are underway to address the issues faced by those working in the tourism sector and this approach is expected to extend to other fields in the future. In the current circumstances, devaluing the rupee is not a favourable option. On-going conflicts, such as the Ukrainian war and unrest in Gaza, may contribute to a rise in the prices of goods. Additionally, shipping has been disrupted due to Houthi attacks on ships in the Red Sea. To counter this, if ships reroute around South Africa instead of navigating the Red Sea, it will lead to increased cargo costs. In response, a decision has been made to deploy a ship from the Sri Lanka Navy to the Red Sea, contributing to the security of the region against Houthi activities. Strengthening the rupee and implementing the right economic programs can propel us forward swiftly. It is crucial to emphasize that the handicraft industry should be transformed into a foreign exchange earning sector, and the government is actively working to provide the necessary support. State Minister for Small and Medium Enterprise Prasanna Ranaweera: Development, highlighted this during an award ceremony dedicated to honouring individuals who have contributed to Sri Lankas traditional handicraft industry for two decades. Despite the challenges the country is facing, organizing this handicraft exhibition in the New Year is considered a significant accomplishment, instilling fresh hope. The revival of the handicrafts sector is attributed to the guidance of government experts and traditional industries, signifying positive momentum even amid challenging times. The governments commitment to supporting small and medium enterprises, especially in the traditional handicraft sector, underscores its dedication to fostering economic growth and foreign exchange earnings. Despite the prevailing crisis in the country, it is commendable that the President recognizes and values the contributions of artists in this field. In the recent budget, traditional artisans were granted necessary credit facilities, reflecting the governments support for this sector. With a considerable global demand for handicrafts, the goal is set to earn Rs.01 billion from the handicraft industry by the years 2024-2025. Traditionally, artisans faced numerous crises, struggling to obtain the essential materials for their craft. However, concerted efforts have been made to address these challenges and provide the necessary ingredients for industrialists. Today, the traditional industry is experiencing a renewed vitality, and it is imperative to safeguard and promote these traditional industries. Strengthening their economy requires on-going efforts and support. The event was attended by Minister of Industries and Health Dr. Ramesh Pathirana, State for Women and Childrens Affairs Mrs. Geeta Kumarasinghe, State Minister for Education Mr. Suren Raghavan, Secretary of the Ministry of Industries Mr. J.M.T. Jayasundara, Chairman of the National Crafts Council Mr. Sampath Arehapola, Chairman of the National Enterprise Development Authority Mr. Lasantha Kariyapperuma, as well as foreign High Commissioners, Ambassadors and officials of relevant line institutions.",

        "date": "January 4, 2024 10:37 am",
        "content": "Several Rohingya refugees in Sri Lanka protested outside the UN refugee agencys office this week due to the announced closure of its Sri Lanka office at the end of 2024. The refugees also submitted an appeal to UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) on Tuesday, calling for the agency not to abandon them without arranging permanent solutions. The Rohingya are a majority-Muslim ethnic group from Myanmar. However, they are not considered one of the countrys 135 official ethnic groups and have been denied citizenship in the Southeast Asian country since 1982, effectively rendering them stateless. As a result of serious human rights violations and abuses in Kachin, Rakhine and Shan States in 2017, which are principally committed by the Myanmar security forces, millions of Rohingya were forced to flee Myanmar and went to Bangladesh. However, living conditions were still harsh in Bangladesh as they faced movement restrictions and food and medicine shortages after being moved to an isolated island by the authorities. According to the appeal form, these refugees who took a boat from Bangladesh to find a better life were rescued by Sri Lanka navy after drifting around the Indian Ocean Island nations northern coast. After a period of detention, they were allowed to stay in Sri Lanka temporarily but were unable obtain citizenship. In their letter to the UN, the refugees write, We appeal to the UNHCR not to abandon us and help us find a permanent solution in another country that will help us overcome uncertainty and not make us and our children permanently stateless. The Rohingya refugees also claimed that the monthly allowance provided by UNHCR is crucial for their basic survival since Sri Lanka is not a contracting state to the 1951 Refugee Convention. That means that they have no right to legally work in the country to meet the demands of living, healthcare and education. The refugees call on UNHCR to negotiate with Sri Lanka government to legally stay and not to stop their monthly allowance without making other arrangements. A 2018 fact-finding mission report of the Human Rights Council called for the UN to assist Myanmar in meeting its responsibility to protect its people from genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. The council also said that the UN needs to establish a trust fund for victim support, through which victims can receive psychosocial support, legal aid and livelihood support, and others means of assistance. However, according to UNCHRs report in 2023, there is a funding gap of 289,416, which represents only 13 percent of the financial requirements for Sri Lanka. Source: Jurist --Agencies",

Accordingly, an MMR (measles-mumps-rubella) Supplementary Immunization Activity (SIA) is scheduled to be held on January 06 (Saturday) at all immunization clinic centres in 9 high-risk health districts. The vaccination program will take place from 9:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. in Colombo (including the CMC area), Gampaha, Kalutara, Galle, Matara, Kandy, Jaffna, Kurunegala and Kalmunai health districts. The Epidemiology Unit said children born between April 07, 2023, and July 05, 2023, are eligible to receive the additional vaccination dose. The MMR vaccination should be considered an additional vaccination dose, the Epidemiology Unit explained, noting that routine MMR vaccination should be given to all children who have received SIA-MMR vaccination, on completion of 9 months and 3 years of age. Concerns have been raised after Sri Lanka recorded over 700 cases of measles over the course of 2023, despite being declared by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2019 as the fourth country in the Southeast Asian region to eliminate the acute viral respiratory illness. Health officials have urged parents to ensure their children receive the necessary immunization.",

        "content": "A 13-year-old American is the first person to ever beat Tetris, forcing the more than three-decade-old classic Nintendo video game into a kill screen. Willis Gibson, who goes by the streamer name Blue Scuti, said Please crash as he arranged the puzzle pieces cascading down the screen and moments later got his wish when the game froze, leading him to repeatedly exclaim Oh my God! in a video uploaded to YouTube on Jan. 2. Gibson broke world records for the overall score, level achieved and total numbers of lines, according 404 Media. This is unbelievable, Vince Clemente, CEO of Classic Tetris World Championship, told Reuters. Developers didnt think anyone would ever make it that far and now the game has officially been beaten by a human being. Previously, only an artificial intelligence computer program had beaten Tetris, Clemente said. Willis employs a rolling controller technique popularized in 2021 that allows a player to manipulate the directional pad, or D-pad, at least 20 times per second to move the blocks, far more than the previously popular hyper tapping method, 404 Media said. Tetris, which was first released in 1984 and became a near-immediate worldwide sensation, challenges players to rotate and conjoin seven different falling block shapes. Created by Alexey Pajitnov at the Moscow Academy of Science during the height of the Cold War, and developed as a business by gaming entrepreneur Henk Rogers, Tetris has shown remarkable staying power, spanning generations. It is the best-selling video game of all time with 520 million copies sold, according to The Tetris Company. Source: Reuters -Agencies",

        "date": "January 4, 2024 11:49 am",
        "content": "Hospitals in at least four U.S. states have reinstated mask mandates amid a rise in cases of COVID, seasonal flu and other respiratory illness. Healthcare facilities in New York, California, Illinois and Massachusetts have made masks mandatory among patients and providers. New York City Health Commissioner Dr. Ashwin Vasan told WABC TV on Wednesday that mask mandates had resumed at all 11 of the citys public hospitals, 30 health centers and five long-term care facilities. What we dont want is staffing shortages, right? When we saw the omicron wave in 2022, the biggest issues were not only people getting sick, but that we had a lot of frontline health workers, they were out with COVID, Vasan told WABC. The most recent weekly data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showed there were over 29,000 hospitalizations from COVID across the U.S. from Dec. 17-23, up more than 16 from the previous week. The CDC also reported over 14,700 flu hospitalizations in that same period. Mask mandates were political and cultural flashpoints during the COVID pandemic, sparking anger among those who bucked medical advice and felt masks did little to suppress the spread of the illness. A conservative-dominated Supreme Court struck down President Joe Bidens federal vaccine-or-test mandate for companies, and a judge appointed by his Republican predecessor struck down his public transportation mask mandate. There was also deep resentment among those who did wear masks and felt their health was put in jeopardy by those who did not. More than 1.1 million Americans have died from COVID, CDC figures show, a greater rate than most other wealthy countries. Rush University medical system in Chicago said on Tuesday that it was requiring patients, visitors and staff to wear hospital-approved masks in some areas of the campus. They include clinical waiting areas and patient registration. Cook County Health, which encompasses Chicago, and Endeavor Health in the Chicago suburbs, last month started requiring masks again, after the Illinois Department of Public Health asked hospitals to step up mitigation efforts in several areas, including facility-wide masking. In Massachusetts, Berkshire Health Systems began mandatory masking on Wednesday, according to a statement. In California, Los Angeles County on Saturday reinstated masking at all licensed health care facilities, according to a county statement provided to the City News Service. The countys health department did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Source: Reuters -Agencies",

        "date": "January 4, 2024 01:36 pm",
        "content": "A special meeting was recently held in the Parliament under the chairmanship of the Minister of Justice, Prisons Affairs and Constitutional Reforms, Dr. Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe, to obtain ideas for the legal amendments to be made in order to increase the state revenue. Accordingly, there was a discussion at length about bringing necessary legal amendments to regulate the Inland Revenue Department, Sri Lanka Customs and Excise Department. Mahindananda Aluthgamage, Chair of the Sectoral Oversight Committee on National Economic and Physical Plans, addressing the meeting, explained that the Inland Revenue Department had been brought before the Sectoral Oversight Committee on several occasions and stated that there were a number of issues identified. The Chair further explained that any person can stay for 15 years without paying taxes. The Inland Revenue Department has 30 months under the existing Act to assess a tax file and another 24 months to consider appeals. Accordingly, a tax file remains in the Inland Revenue Department for more than 54 months and post appealing to the Tax Appeals Commission, they receive 2 years according to the Act, he said. Thereafter, appeals can be made to the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court and it will consume approximately 15 years, he said. The officials of the Inland Revenue Department addressing the meeting stated that the arrears tax revenue due on 30.06.2023 is Rs. 943 billion, and the amount cannot be recovered due to various reasons is Rs. 767 billion and the recoverable amount is Rs. 175 billion. Moreover, the officials further explained that Rs. 37 billion has been collected as tax arrears this year. Once the tax report is received by the Inland Revenue Department on or before the 30th of November every year, the officials who explained the process pointed out that after receiving the tax report, the relevant officer will enter the information into the RAMIS system and identify cases where there are problems, and then an audit will be conducted, and that in some cases further information will be brought to make some clarifications. The officials also pointed out that in cases where such information is requested, often the tax holders deliberately delay the information. The officials pointed out that the existing Act has 30 months for the tax report to be audited by the officer and after that there is another two years to hear the appeal after appealing to the Commissioner General. The Committee was of the view that the current pried of two years for the Commissioner to hear appeals is too long and it is desirable to reduce it to six months. However, if the decision is not given within 06 months, it should be assumed that the assessment amount will not change, the Minister of Justice said. Therefore, it was suggested that the Act should be amended to require that taxpayers should pay at least 50 of the assessed amount if they appeal to the Tax Commission. The powers of the Tax Appeals Commission were also discussed in the Committee. Accordingly, the attention of the Committee was focused on making some amendments to the Tax Appeals Commission Act. Currently, the Tax Appeals Commission has 270 days to hear an appeal and the Minister pointed out the need to give some time frame for that. The Committee decided that the Tax Appeals Commission should consider only the existing questions about the assessment amount or calculations and if there is any objection to the basic issues, then the necessary amendment to the Act should be brought for appeal to the Court of Appeal. The Committee was of the opinion that it is appropriate to reduce the 30-month period to one year for the assessment of the Act. After a long discussion, the Committee decided to keep the 30 months as it is, but it is appropriate to give the necessary power to the Minister of Finance to change the period through the Gazette in cases where necessary. Accordingly, as an amendment to the Act, it was proposed to include in the Act that after receiving the tax appeal to the Commissioner General, his order should be given within 6 months and if not, it is assumed that the initial assessment is final and permanent. Accordingly, if the taxpayer does not agree with the decision, he can appeal to the Tax Appeals Commission within one month. The Tax Appeals Commission shall render its decision within six (06) months and the Tax Appeals Commission shall only have the power to inquire into the existing calculations of the assessed amount by the Inland Revenue Department. Other preliminary objections such as questions of law may be appealed to the Court of Appeal. It was also suggested in the Act that the appeal court should also be given a certain time frame, that is, the appeal should be heard within one year. The Minister of Justice also agreed to establish a special court complex within the judicial system to hear tax appeals. The Committee decided to draft amendments to the Inland Revenue Department Act by incorporating the matters raised in this discussion by the Attorney General and the legal draftsman and after preparing the amendment, the Committee decided to meet and discuss again in the next day in Parliament.",

        "content": "As per President Ranil Wickremesinghes directives, measures have been initiated to enhance the medical allowances provided by the Presidents Fund, increasing them from 50 to 100, effective from January 01, 2024. Mr. Sarath Kumara, the Secretary of the Presidents Fund, announced that in line with the Presidents guidance, services offered to the public by the Presidents Fund will be expanded from the year 2024, the Presidents Media Division reported. To achieve this, previously uncovered medical conditions have been identified, and assistance has commenced for those diseases. Notably, starting this year, medical aid will cover eye surgeries for individuals under 21 years of age, performed in private or semi-public hospitals. In an effort to minimize the influx of patients seeking medical assistance in the city, a streamlined registration system within the Presidents Fund for hospitals across the island has been implemented from 2024, the statement said. Furthermore, the stipend for post-working hours heart surgeries at Karapitiya Hospital will be increased this year, with plans to extend this system to other hospitals. Additionally, starting this year, medical aid payments of up to Rs. 01 million will be provided for liver transplant surgeries for young children at the Ragama Hospital. Recognizing a gap in coverage, medical aid will now be extended to cover cancer surgeries performed in private or semi-public hospitals. Moreover, both private or semi-public hospitals and government hospitals will offer medical aid for medical tests conducted externally before and after bone marrow transplant surgery, effective this year. Starting this year, the Presidents Fund raises the monthly income limit for medical aid from Rs.150,000 to 200,000 , aiding middle-class individuals. Secretary Mr. Sarath Kumara notes the Funds adherence to the Presidents directives in providing prompt services in 2023. In that year, over 8,000 pending medical aid applications were addressed, spending 1,342 million rupees. Additionally, 3458 applications received in 2023 were processed, with Rs. 844.7 million disbursed. Further, as per the instructions of the President, the Presidents Fund has implemented the program of providing scholarships for the students who have passed the G.E.C. OL exam and who need to be given relief in order to continue their education. In the meantime, students who have passed the General Certificate of Education A Level Examination with top marks in the last two years have been selected at the district level and national level to provide financial assistance to those students. Accordingly, Rs. 31.5 million financial assistance has been given to 90 selected students. The Presidents Fund also implemented a program to provide financial and material assistance through the divisional secretaries of the island to uplift family units that are suffering from poverty but can engage in self-employment. Also, programs to provide monthly financial and material support through regional secretariats were successfully implemented in 2023 to identify family units suffering from poverty but unable to engage in self-employment or other work. Financial contribution has been provided for maintaining religious harmony as well as for religious activities and other social activities. Meanwhile, in order to avoid unnecessary delays in the payment of medical aid, the application form for reimbursement of medical aid was updated and the necessary arrangements are being made to make payments within three working days for a medical aid application that is duly completed and delivered to the Presidential Fund without defects. In 2022, a scholarship program commenced for G.E.C. exam-passed students. From each of the education divisions across the island, students were selected. Monthly, within the first two days of work, funds are credited to their bank accounts, and SMS notifications are sent. Currently, these students have received 10 monthly instalments. This year, another initiative began for high-achieving students facing financial challenges after passing the GCE (AL). Fifty students from one education division and a total of 5000 students from 100 education divisions are granted 6000 rupees monthly for 24 months to support their General Certificate of Education studies. The Fund extended support through regional secretaries, aiding impoverished family units and implementing successful monthly assistance programs in 2023. Financial contributions were made for religious harmony and social activities. Efforts are underway to swiftly provide warranty certificates for hospitalized patients undergoing surgery or treatment. Upon admission, hospitals will deduct the agreed-upon fund amount from medical bills, streamlining the process. Secretary Mr. Sarath Kumara ensures that a single visit to the Presidents Fund is sufficient for patients, minimizing unnecessary calls or inconveniences. Furthermore, a ceremonial event took place at the office premises yesterday, blessing the Presidents Fund staff for their new-year duties in 2024. Venerable Kirinde Assaji from the Hunupitiya Gangaramaya, Colombo, led the Pancha Sheela group in a solemn ceremony attended by dignitaries such as Secretary to the President Mr. Saman Ekanayake, Secretary to the Prime Minister Mr. Anura Dissanayake and others. --PMD",

        "content": "A Nevada judge was attacked Wednesday by a defendant in a felony battery case who leaped both a defense table and the judges bench.The judge experienced some injuries, according to a court statement. The defendant was arrested and now faces new felony charges. pic.twitter.comO25wF2RwOR The Associated Press (AP) January 4, 2024 LAS VEGAS (AP)  A Nevada judge was attacked Wednesday by a defendant in a felony battery case who leaped over a defense table and the judges bench, landing atop her and sparking a bloody brawl involving court officials and attorneys, officials and witnesses said. In a violent scene captured by courtroom video, Clark County District Judge Mary Kay Holthus fell back from her seat against a wall and suffered some injuries but was not hospitalized, courthouse officials said. A courtroom marshal was also injured as he came to the judges aid and was hospitalized for treatment of a bleeding gash on his forehead and a dislocated shoulder, according to the officials and witnesses. The attack occurred about 11 a.m. at the Regional Justice Center in Las Vegas. The defendant, Deobra Delone Redden, 30, was wrestled to the floor behind the judges bench by several court and jail officers and courtroom staff members  including some who are seen throwing punches. He was arrested and jailed at the Clark County Detention Center, where records showed he faces multiple new felony charges including battery on a protected person  referring to the judge and court officers. It happened so fast it was hard to know what to do, said Richard Scow, the chief county district attorney who prosecuted Redden on a case that stemmed from an arrest last year on allegations that Redden attacked a person with a baseball bat. Reddens defense attorney, Caesar Almase, did not respond to later telephone and email messages seeking comment. Redden was not in custody when he arrived at court Wednesday. He wore a white shirt and dark pants as he stood next to Almase, asking the judge for leniency while describing himself as a person who never stops trying to do the right thing no matter how hard it is. Im not a rebellious person, he told the judge, later adding that he doesnt think he should be sent to prison. But if its appropriate for you then you have to do what you have to do. As the judge made it clear she intended to put him behind bars, and the court marshal moved to handcuff him, Redden yelled expletives and charged forward  amid screams from people who had been sitting with Redden in the courtroom audience. Records showed that Redden, a Las Vegas resident, was evaluated and found mentally competent to stand trial before pleading guilty in November to a reduced charge of attempted battery causing substantial bodily harm. He previously served prison time in Nevada on a domestic battery conviction, state records show. Holthus, a career prosecutor with more than 27 years of courthouse experience, was elected to the state court bench in 2018 and again in 2022. In a statement, court spokesperson Mary Ann Price said officials were reviewing all our protocols and will do whatever is necessary to protect the judiciary, the public and our employees.
