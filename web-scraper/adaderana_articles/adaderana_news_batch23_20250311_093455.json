Non-academic employees from 17 universities and 19 joint post-graduate institutions have been on strike for nearly 70 days, severely disrupting the countrys higher education sector.

The distribution of scholarships for the Colombo district took place on June 19th under the patronage of President Ranil Wickremesinghe at the Temple Trees and beginning tomorrow, the scholarship distribution will extend to the remaining 24 districts across the country. Selected students in the Hambantota district will receive their scholarships today (12). Scholarships will be given in the Badulla, Matale, and Jaffna districts on July 13. Kilinochchi district will follow on July 14. Gampaha district will have its distribution on July 16 and 17, while Galle and Anuradhapura districts will receive their scholorships on July 15, said Presidents Media Devision. Further distributions will take place in Vavuniya, Batticaloa, Ratnapura, Kegalle, and Nuwara Eliya districts on July 16. On July 17, the scholarships will be awarded in Kalutara, Mannar, Ampara, Kurunegala, and Kandy districts. The process continues on July 18 in Mullaitivu, Trincomalee, and Polonnaruwa districts. Monaragala and Matara districts will be awarded on July 19, and finally, the Puttalam district will receive their scholarships on July 22. Under the patronage of District Secretaries and in coordination with all zonal education offices and principals, the scholarship awards will be distributed. In the first phase, only a portion of the scholarship recipients will be invited to the award ceremony. The list of scholarship winners selected in the first phase from each school at the education zone level across all districts will be published on the official Facebook page of the Presidents Fund. Scholarships are being awarded to A-Level students at Rs. 6000 per month for 24 months. A total of 6000 scholarship winners have already been selected, with 60 students chosen from each of the 100 zonal offices. These students will receive their scholarships at the award ceremony. Additionally, arrangements will be made to provide scholarships of Rs. 6000 per month to students until they appear for the G.E.C. A-Level examination. However, it has been noted that some schools have not yet submitted applications for the scholarship program, which provides Rs. 3000 per month for 12 months to selected students from first grade to 11th grade. Principals of schools that have not yet submitted applications have been instructed to do so promptly. A list of schools that have not applied for scholarships has been distributed to all zonal education directors. Therefore, if a school has not yet applied for scholarships, the Presidents Fund urges parents and students to address this issue promptly by submitting the necessary applications. President Ranil Wickremasinghes principle is that no one should be excluded during this challenging period. To enhance educational opportunities for children and prevent school dropout due to financial constraints, the President has instructed schools that did not apply for scholarships to apply promptly and seize this opportunity provided by the fund. --PMD--",

The suspects have been arrested near a garment factory in the Middeniya police area by a team of officers of the STF Organised Crime Unit I. The suspects, identified as Ramanayakage Indika Kumara alias Kale Mahinda and Jayawardena Abeysinghe Pathiranage Sandakelum Jayawardena, were arrested while in possession of 02 locally manufactured Galkatas firearms, 02 rounds of live ammunition (12-bore), 100 grams of heroin, a motorcycle suspected to have been used in the shooting and 3 mobile phones. They have been handed over to the Kolonna Police Station for further investigation. Meanwhile it has been uncovered that these suspects are close associates of Rotumba Amila, a member of an organized crime syndicate who is currently operating a drug network in Sri Lanka from France. The shooting victim, S.B. Kimarasena, a resident of Aptanwatte, Aliwadiya, Kolonna, is believed to have been killed in retaliation for a previous assault incident on a relative of Rotumba Amila. Further investigations have revealed that Rotumba Amila had provided Rs. 400,000 in cash and heroin to the suspects to carry out the hit and that the suspect has maintained close ties with Makandure Madushs criminal group. It has also come to light that the arrested suspects have previous convictions for robbery, assault, and murder, with pending court cases against them.",

        "content": "Attorney-at-Law Aruna Laksiri has filed a Fundamental Rights (FR) petition before the Supreme Court, seeking an order to prevent holding of the Presidential Election as the 19th Amendment to the Constitution has not been properly passed in Parliament. The petition argues that the 19th Amendment to the Constitution was not properly passed in Parliament and therefore calls for a referendum to ensure its proper passage, Ada Derana reporter said. The Election Commission and its members, the General Secretary of Parliament and the Attorney General have been named as respondents. The petitioner claims that through the 19th Amendment to the Constitution, Article 70 of the Constitution has been amended to deprive the President of the power to dissolve an elected Parliament after one year has passed. The petitioner asserts that the amendment has not been approved by a referendum, even though a Supreme Court bench ruled that the amendment should be referred to a referendum. The petitioner points out that the amendment cannot be considered as a law because it has not been approved by a referendum and signed by the President. Therefore, the petitioner argues that it is wrong to continue to accept the 19th Amendment as a law. On Monday (08), the Supreme Court dismissed a fundamental rights (FR) petition seeking an order preventing the calling of a Presidential Election until the Supreme Court delivers its interpretation on the date of the presidential poll. The petition, which was filed by an entrepreneur named C.D. Lenawa last Wednesday (03), had requested that an interim order be issued to prevent the holding of the presidential election within the currently scheduled period until the court delivers its interpretation on the date of the next presidential election.",

        "content": "State Minister of Transport, Lasantha Alagiyawanna, stated that the on-going strikes are motivated by political interests rather than genuine professional rights. He also announced that a gazette with the necessary regulations on speed limits, aimed at reducing road accidents, will be issued within the next two weeks, said Presidents Media Devision. State Minister for Transport Lasantha Alagiyawanna, made this statement during a news conference held yesterday (11) at the Presidential Media Centre (PMC), under the theme Collective Path to a Stable Country. In his comments, the State Minister further said, We have initiated several programs to enhance efficiency in the transport sector. Notably, the Kadawatha bus terminal is scheduled to be opened in August under the patronage of President Ranil Wickremesinghe. These bus terminals incorporate modern transport management methods and advanced technology. In 2023, there were 2,214 reported road accidents resulting in 2,321 deaths. As of the 30th of June, 1,103 road accidents have been reported this year, with 1,154 fatalities. To address this issue, our Ministry has implemented various programs aimed at reducing the number of road accidents. The National Council for Road Safety has allocated LKR 50 million to the Sri Lanka Police for the purchase of necessary speed control equipment. Additionally, the Ministry of Transport will issue a gazette with new road speed limit regulations within the next two weeks. Furthermore, arrangements have been made to provide teachers with manuals for establishing Road Safety Clubs at the school level. These clubs will be included in the school system as an extracurricular activity, and a medal awarding program has also been introduced. Additionally, we are actively engaged in addressing issues related to the rail strike. The Public Service Commission has already granted approval for the promotion of station masters every five years. The necessary Cabinet paper seeking approval from the Cabinet for this promotion has been prepared. However, it is evident to the public that the current strikes are motivated purely by political agendas. It should be noted that these strikes do not stem from genuine professional grievances. --PMD--",

        "date": "July 12, 2024 12:47 pm",
        "content": "At least 60 people were believed missing in Nepal after two buses were swept by a landslide off a highway and into a swollen river early Friday. Three passengers were rescued as the continuous rain made rescue efforts difficult. The three survivors were being treated in the hospital, government administrator Khima Nanada Bhusal said, adding that they reportedly jumped out of the bus and swam to the banks, where locals found them and took them to a nearby hospital. Landslides also blocked routes to the area in several places, according to Bhusal. Additional rescuers and security forces have been sent to help with rescue efforts. The buses were swept off the highway around 3 a.m. near Simaltal, about 120 kilometers (75 miles) west of the capital, Kathmandu. One bus was carrying at least 24 people, while the other had at least 42, but more could have boarded en route, Bhusal said. A third bus was hit by another landslide on Friday morning a short distance away on the same highway, killing the driver, Bhusal added. It was not clear if there were any other casualties. Nepals Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal said he was saddened by the news and expressed concern over recent flooding and landslides. He added that several government agencies were searching for the missing, in a post on the social media platform X. On Thursday night, a landslide buried a hut and killed a family of seven near the resort town of Pokhara. The family were asleep when the landslide crushed their hut and damaged three more houses nearby. Monsoon season brings heavy rains to Nepal from June to September, often triggering landslides in the mountainous Himalayan country. Source: The Associated Press --Agencies",

        "title": "Biden stands defiant on critical night - but gaffes mar fightback",
        "date": "July 12, 2024 02:31 pm",
        "content": "Joe Biden took to the stage at his Thursday night news conference with everything on the line  his presidency, his re-election hopes, his political life. If those were the stakes, he barely acknowledged them at the hour-long session to mark the end of a Nato summit, having earlier introduced Ukraines President Zelensky as President Putin at a separate event. The news conference was his first unscripted appearance after a disastrous debate with his rival Donald Trump, leading to calls from several Democratic politicians and donors for him to drop out of the race for president. Mr Biden, 81, has faced continuous questions over his age and ability to serve another term, which intensified after the debate. But at the highly anticipated news conference, he dismissed the concerns about his campaign that were posed again and again by a room full of reporters, and promised that he was fighting not for his legacy, but to finish the job he started when he took office in 2021. If I slow down and cant get the job done, thats a sign I shouldnt be doing it, he said. But theres no indication of that yet. Depending on perspective, it was either a sign of dogged determination or of a man in denial about how dire his situation has become. Minutes after the news conference finished, several more Democratic members of Congress publicly called on Mr Biden to step down, joining at least a dozen other lawmakers in the presidents own party who have done so. The question for Joe Bidens campaign is whether the floodgates will now open, or if the tide will hold. The situation will not be helped by two excruciating gaffes that will be remembered by anyone who watched. In his very first answer, he called his own Vice-President Kamala Harris Vice-President Trump  a painful faceplant in front of a national television audience. That came just an hour after another headline-grabbing mistake at a Nato event, when Mr Biden introduced Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky as President Putin, prompting loud gasps in the audience. He corrected the first verbal misstep involving Ukraines leader quickly. The second one he didnt catch, even as some reporters in the room murmured in surprise and several of his top Cabinet secretaries sat stone-faced in the front row of the audience. Those moments - the only major stumbles in an otherwise steady if not vigorous, appearance - will surely prompt nervous Democrats to wonder if there are more gaffes to come if the president presses ahead with his campaign. But for now at least, Mr Biden seemed the happy warrior, insisting he will push on. He laughed and smiled as he was peppered with questions, and said he could keep up with Russias Vladimir Putin and Chinas Xi Jinping, even if the hoarseness and cough that had been on display during his debate two weeks ago still appeared to linger. He again insisted he didnt need cognitive tests, telling reporters that if he even saw two doctors or seven, his critics wouldnt be satisfied. The election campaign, he said, had barely started, and he again repeated that he was confident he could beat Donald Trump in Novembers election. The Democratic delegates who will back him officially as the partys nominee at next months convention were free to change their minds as they pleased, he said, before mock whispering: Its not going to happen. He said he would consider stepping aside if his staff gave him data that he couldnt win, but that polls still show the race a dead heat. In that regard, he is on firm ground. An Ipsos survey released earlier on Thursday, for instance, had Mr Biden only one point behind his opponent  well within the margin of error. If theres one thing that has been clear since the start of the year, support for the two candidates has remained remarkably stable despite unprecedented drama surrounding both men. Polling alone wont calm the panic that has set in among many Democratic officials, however, and the storm clouds that linger around Bidens campaign wont be so easily dispelled. More Democratic politicians are waiting in the wings, according to reports, poised to announce their own break with the president, having waited until the conclusion of this Nato summit to voice their concerns. And thats just the first round of tests for the embattled president. He has another high-profile sit-down interview, with NBCs Lester Holt, on Monday. Donors are anxious, and earlier on Thursday several reports suggested that even figures in the presidents own campaign were plotting ways to usher their candidate toward the exit. Despite all of this, Mr Biden made clear that it will be a challenging task to pry the nomination away from him. The 81-year-old man who at times gripped the lectern with two hands and insisted he was the best-qualified person to run the country is not going to exit the stage quietly. Source: BBC --Agencies",

        "content": "Presidents Counsel Mr. K.A. Parinda Ranasinghe has been appointed as the new Attorney General of Sri Lanka by President Ranil Wickremesinghe. He was appointed in terms of Article 61E (b) of the Constitution of Sri Lanka at the Presidential Secretariat, a short while ago, the Presidents Media Division said. The former Senior Additional Solicitor General was recently appointed as the Acting Attorney General. The Constitutional Council yesterday unanimously approved the nomination of Senior Additional Solicitor General Parinda Ranasinghe as the Attorney General. Ranasinghe took oaths as the Acting Attorney General before the Chief Justice on July 01, after the proposal to extend former Attorney General Sanjay Rajaratnams term by another 06 months was defeated for the second time by the Constitutional Council. However, the appointment sparked controversy, as allegations were levelled against the government claiming that the new appointment overlooked Senior Additional Solicitor General Ayesha Jinasena, despite her seniority and eligibility for the role, due to gender bias. However, in response to the relevant allegations, Presidents Secretary Saman Ekanayake emphasized that there is no constitutional requirement to appoint the senior-most officer from the Attorney Generals Department to this position based on seniority. Issuing a statement, he also expressed that the President is constitutionally empowered, under Article 41C of the Constitution, to appoint the Attorney General with the approval of the Constitutional Council.",

        "date": "July 12, 2024 04:26 pm",
        "content": "A group of Members of Parliament from the opposition have sent a letter to the Election Commission, requesting that the Presidential Election be held on the earliest possible date in order to prevent any attempts to delay polls. Accordingly, the parliamentarians urged the commission to exercise its maximum legal authority to ensure the election is conducted in a free and fair atmosphere. The letter has been signed by a majority of opposition MPs including members of the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) as well other independent opposition MPs. The letter states: It is no secret that the current government, worried about the possible loss in the upcoming presidential election, is making various efforts to postpone the presidential election scheduled for year 2024. Another trick in that process was revealed the other day. It is to bring a bill for an amendment to the provisions of the Constitution regarding the term of office of the President, which has already been dearly interpreted by the Supreme Cent. According to the Constitution of Sri Lanka, the Presidential Election which is a major election in which the guaranteed inalienable sovereignty of the people and the right to vote are experimented should not be postponed for any reason. 02 years ago, the then anti-people ruler was ousted by a struggle of the general public and a temporary caretaker president was appointed only for the remainder of the term, not on the basis of direct popular will, but through the vote of elected Members of Parliament. Therefore, the citizens should be given the opportunity, to elect a new president with the will of the people to exercise executive powers on their behalf at the earliest possible opportunity. It is your absolute duty as the Election Commission and ours as public representatives and active political movements. In view of these facts, I kindly request you to make necessary arrangements to hold the presidential election on the first possible day and to exercise your legal powers in full to conduct the election in a free and fair atmosphere. මතවරණ කමසමට ලපයක by poornima on Scribd",

        "date": "July 12, 2024 04:34 pm",
        "content": "Indian billionaire Mukesh Ambanis son is set to marry on Friday, marking the culmination of a wedding extravaganza that lasted nearly seven months and brought into focus the staggering wealth and influence of the richest man in Asia. Anant Ambani the youngest son of the tycoon got engaged to Radhika Merchant the daughter of pharmaceutical magnate Viren Merchant in December last year. The couple will wed in a Hindu ceremony at the Ambani-owned Jio World Convention Centre in the Indian financial capital of Mumbai. Among the invitees expected to attend the event are: Former British Prime Ministers Boris Johnson and Tony Blair, former United States Secretary of State John Kerry, former Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper and Former Swedish Prime Minister Carl Bildt. Aramco CEO Amin Nasser, Samsung Electronics Chairman Jay Lee and Lockheed Martin CEO James Taiclet are also expected to be present along with several other global business leaders, India media reports said. According to a report from the Reuters news agency, Mukesh Ambani hired 100 planes, including three Falcon-2000 jets, to fly his guests to the party. Who is Mukesh Ambani? The 67-year-old Mukesh Ambani is the chairman of Reliance Industries, which has interests in petrochemicals, oil and gas, telecom, retail and financial services. With a fortune of over 123 billion (113 billion), he is ranked as the 11th richest person in the world, according to the Forbes billionaires list. He is also an important ally of Indias right-wing Hindu nationalist leader, Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Critics of Ambani said his company has thrived mainly because of political connections during the Congress governments in the 1970s and 80s and later under Modis rule since 2014. The grand Indian wedding A recent report by Outlook put the estimated cost of the entire wedding celebration at Rs 4,000-5,000 crore (approximately 600 million), which amounts to just 0.05 of the Ambanis net worth. While Anants engagement ceremony was a private affair at a temple in the northern state of Rajasthan, it was followed by a string of celebratory events that featured performances by pop stars, including Rihanna and Justin Bieber. In March, Mukesh Ambani threw a pre-wedding bash for the couple in Gujarat, which was attended by nearly 1,200 people from around the world, including tech moguls Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg and former US President Donald Trumps daughter Ivanka. Singer Rihanna charged between 8-9 million for her performance at the event, according to some Indian media reports. In May, the Ambanis and their guests jetted off on a four-day luxury cruise in Europe. Early in July, Ambani and his wife Nita hosted a mass wedding for 50 underprivileged couples ahead of their sons wedding. Last week, Canadian singer Justin Bieber held a performance as part of the latest pre-wedding festivities of the billionaire heir. Source: AP, AFP, Reuters --Agencies",

        "date": "July 12, 2024 04:58 pm",
        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe stated that a robust economy can be established by enhancing the export economy, manufacturing, tourism, technology sectors, and modern agriculture. He highlighted that the government has already laid the foundation for this vision. The President made these remarks today (12), during the inauguration ceremony of the second and third phases of the Export Processing Zone in Bingiriya, which is the largest of its kind in Sri Lanka. Addressing the ceremony, the President emphasized that efforts are underway to create new investment zones to further bolster the export economy of the country. Upon completion of the Bingiriya Investment Zone, it is estimated that an export income of USD 2,600 million will be generated, and 75,000 job opportunities will be created. President Ranil Wickremesinghe inaugurated the newly constructed Dongxia Industrial  Commerce Co. Ltd in the Bingiriya Export Processing Zone. During his visit, the President toured the premises and engaged in cordial conversations with the employees, said the Presidents Media Devision. Following the tour, President Ranil Wickremesinghe held a discussion with officials from the Board of Investment, the Urban Development Authority, investors, and entrepreneurs. During the discussion, the President instructed officials to take steps to develop the areas of Bingiriya, Dummalasuriya, and Madampe to metropolitan standards, alongside the development of infrastructure in the export processing zone. Plans to develop Bingiriya into a major economic region of the country were also discussed at these discussions. These plans include the development of agriculture, the manufacturing industry, information technology, tourism, and the fishing industry. President Ranil Wickremesinghe further said; Dongxia started its business in Sri Lanka in 2018. Even when the country faced bankruptcy, they trusted us and stayed to open this new factory. So far, the company has provided job opportunities to around 400 people, creating a promising future for the youth of the country. We should establish more such investment zones. The Bingiriya area should be developed as an investment zone to boost the overall economy. In 2018, we initiated the Bingiriya Investment Zone, and today, another thousand acres have been added to this zone. We all went through a very difficult time. When the countrys economy collapsed, no one stepped forward to take over. A party with only one seat in Parliament had to assume the presidency, an unprecedented event in the world. Today, Sri Lanka is free from bankruptcy. Through the debt restructuring process, we have received relief of USD 08 billion from our total debt. Additionally, the entire loan repayment period has been extended to 2043, giving the government some breathing room to stabilize the economy. If this program is not carried forward, the countrys economy may collapse again. Even today, our import costs exceed our export earnings. If this continues, the country may face bankruptcy again in 15 years. Therefore, proper economic management should be maintained by controlling the acquisition of foreign loans. Countries like Vietnam, Thailand, and Indonesia have progressed to an export-driven economy, but Sri Lanka has not yet reached that level. Therefore, we must uphold the agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and advance the countrys economy. Steps should be taken to strengthen the export economy. The factory opening today is a good example of fostering an export economy. A strong economy can be built by developing the export economy, manufacturing sector, tourism sector, technology sector, and modern agriculture. The government has already laid the basic foundation for this. If this program is preserved, there is a bright future ahead. With the aim of developing the export sector in Sri Lanka, the Bingiriya Export Zone was established here in 2018. This initiative aims to develop Kuliyapitiya, Dummalasuriya, Madampe, Bingiriya, and Chilaw areas too. Through the development of this entire investment zone, 75,000 job opportunities can be created. Additionally, Iranavila, Bingiriya, and Chilaw are to be developed as tourist areas, with plans to build a golf course in the Iranavila area. There is also a focus on creating an IT zone and utilizing the estate of the Chilaw Plantation Company for an agricultural modernization program. With the development of this investment zone, new housing and a new city will emerge, creating numerous business opportunities for its residents. We aim to develop Bingiriya as a major economic zone in the country through the advancement of agriculture, industry, manufacturing, information technology, tourism, and the fishing industry. This will also significantly improve the Pannala and Kuliyapitiya areas, and we believe that the restoration of Madampe will be achieved through these efforts. All these programs have been implemented for the development of the country. We are currently in a period of gradual recovery after a difficult time. There are still unresolved issues affecting the people. To address these, we must adhere to a unified economic system. For success, we need to enact economic transformation in the country, with Bingiriya playing a pivotal role. Lets build a new economy centred on Bingiriya and Iranavila areas. It should be stated that you all are part of this transformation. --PMD--",

        "date": "July 12, 2024 07:06 pm",
        "content": "The Asian Development Bank (ADB) approved a 100 million policy-based loan to support and facilitate reforms in Sri Lanka, aimed particularly at enhancing the financial sustainability of the power sector in the island country. As per a release from the regional development bank dated July 11, the Power Sector Reforms and Financial Sustainability Program will complement the International Monetary Funds Extended Fund Facility arrangement and bolster the operational efficiency and competitiveness of the island countrys power sector. The program will help create a conducive environment for private investments, boosting renewable energy development, and modernizing power grids. Developing cost-competitive renewable energy and providing reliable and affordable electricity supply--with a transparent and independent power sector regulatory framework--will help Sri Lanka drive economic growth and address the current financial and economic crisis, said ADB Principal Energy Specialist Jaimes Kolantharaj. The program will also support the development of renewable energy to accelerate the countrys transition to clean energy as envisaged under Sri Lankas nationally determined contributions. It will support regulatory reforms with the implementation of the new national tariff policy that will improve financial sustainability of the sector through cost-reflective tariffs. To help accelerate investments in renewable energy, the program will assist multiple initiatives under the renewable energy expansion plans for 2023-2030. The key initiatives include implementing a periodic revision of feed-in tariffs for small power plants and rooftop solar users, facilitating the integration of renewable energy projects into the national grid, and effective application of a competitive procurement framework for renewable energy projects. ADB said it will provide an additional USD 1 million technical assistance grant from its Technical Assistance Special Fund to support the power sector reforms in the island nation. The island nations economy is stabilizing from a crippling financial crisis of 2022, which was triggered by depleting foreign exchange reserves. Sri Lanka faced a severe economic crisis as a result of past policy missteps. Its economy has shown signs of recovery in recent months since then. Source: ANI --Agencies",

Balasuriya agreed with Modis assessment that increased connectivity between Sri Lanka, India, Myanmar, and Thailand would unlock more opportunities for the region. He was in New Delhi to attend the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC) Foreign Ministers Retreat. Balasuriya highlighted the informal and candid nature of the BIMSTEC Foreign Ministers Retreat. It was very well organized, allowing us to share our ideas openly, he said to ANI. Reflecting on his meeting with PM Modi, Balasuriya noted it was his first encounter with the Indian leader. The Prime Minister is both charming and visionary. He pointed out that the European Unions success was largely due to connectivity, something that South Asia and Southeast Asia lag behind in. Therefore, we must focus on improving connectivity, Balasuriya added. He concurred with Modis view that enhanced connectivity would foster economic growth and trade across the Bay of Bengal region. Discussing Sri Lankas approach to energy cooperation, trade, and transportation within BIMSTEC, Balasuriya stated that these areas are categorized under three verticals: energy security, food security, and peoples security. He highlighted initiatives like Indias e-visa application for medical tourism in BIMSTEC nations. Indias advances in space technology, including BIMSTEC satellites and nanosatellites, also hold significant potential, he mentioned. When asked about the need for more attention to sectors like tourism, trade, business, exports, and imports in Sri Lanka, Balasuriya affirmed this need. We are focusing on enhanced connectivity with India. For example, Prime Minister Modi mentioned that developing wind power in northeast and northwest Sri Lanka could create new revenue streams, Balasuriya said. Source: ANI --Agencies",

The Sri Lanka cricket team will replace India cricket team if the latter decide to pull out of the Champions Trophy 2025. Rohit Sharma and co. are highly unlikely to travel to Pakistan which is scheduled to host the marquee tournament next year. As per reports, Sri Lanka who did not qualify for CT 2025 owing to their 9th placed finish in the 2023 ODI World Cup will replace India. Sri Lanka, who were the winners of the event in 2002, failed to qualify for the Champions Trophy for the first-time ever. While India is unlikely to travel to Pakistan, the BCCI is likely to request that the International Cricket Council (ICC) relocate the event to either Sri Lanka or the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The final decision on Indias participation in Pakistan rests with the Indian government. BCCI Vice-President Rajeev Shukla previously stated that the team would only travel to Pakistan with government approval. This wouldnt be the first time Indias stance has impacted a tournaments location. The 2023 Asia Cup was held in a hybrid format due to the same issue. All of Indias matches were played in Sri Lanka, while the remaining teams competed in Pakistan. Source: Inside sport --Agencies",

        "date": "July 13, 2024 11:00 am",
        "content": "The worlds first hydrogen-powered commercial passenger ferry will start operating on San Francisco Bay as part of plans to phase out diesel-powered vessels and reduce planet-warming carbon emissions, California officials said Friday, demonstrating the ship. The 70-foot (21-meter) catamaran called the MV Sea Change will transport up to 75 passengers along the waterfront between Pier 41 and the downtown San Francisco ferry terminal starting July 19, officials said. The service will be free for six months while its being run as part of a pilot program. The implications for this are huge because this isnt its last stop, said Jim Wunderman, chair of the San Francisco Bay Area Water Emergency Transportation Authority, which runs commuter ferries across the bay. If we can operate this successfully, there are going to be more of these vessels in our fleet and in other folks fleets in the United States and we think in the world. Sea Change can travel about 300 nautical miles and operate for 16 hours before it needs to refuel. The fuel cells produce electricity by combining oxygen and hydrogen in an electrochemical reaction that emits water as a byproduct. The technology could help clean up the shipping industry, which produces nearly 3 of the worlds total greenhouse gas emissions, officials said. Thats less than from cars, trucks, rail or aviation but still a lot  and its rising. Frank Wolak, president and CEO of the Fuel Cell  Hydrogen Energy Association, said the ferry is meaningful because its hard to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from vessels. The real value of this is when you multiply out by the number of ferries operating around the world, he said. Theres great potential here. This is how you can start chipping away at the carbon intensity of your ports. Backers also hope hydrogen fuel cells could eventually power container ships. The International Maritime Organization, which regulates commercial shipping, wants to halve its greenhouse gas releases by midcentury. As fossil fuel emissions continue warming Earths atmosphere, the Biden administration is turning to hydrogen as an energy source for vehicles, manufacturing and generating electricity. It has been offering 8 billion to entice the nations industries, engineers and planners to figure out how to produce and deliver clean hydrogen. Environmental groups say hydrogen presents its own pollution and climate risks. For now, the hydrogen that is produced globally each year, mainly for refineries and fertilizer manufacturing, is made using natural gas. That process warms the planet rather than saving it. Indeed, a new study by researchers from Cornell and Stanford universities found that most hydrogen production emits carbon dioxide, which means that hydrogen-fueled transportation cannot yet be considered clean energy. Yet proponents of hydrogen-powered transportation say that in the long run, hydrogen production is destined to become more environmentally safe. They envision a growing use of electricity from wind and solar energy, which can separate hydrogen and oxygen in water. As such renewable forms of energy gain broader use, hydrogen production should become a cleaner and less expensive process. The Sea Change project was financed and managed by the investment firm SWITCH Maritime. The vessel was constructed at Bay Ship and Yacht in Alameda, California, and All-American Marine in Bellingham, Washington. Source: The Associated Press --Agencies",

        "date": "July 13, 2024 11:25 am",
        "content": "A Russian passenger jet crashed Friday near Moscow while flying without passengers, killing its crew of three, officials said. The Sukhoi Superjet 100 plummeted into a forest near the village of Apraksino about 90 kilometers (55 miles) southeast of the Russian capital, according to emergency officials. The plane belonged to Gazprom avia, a carrier owned by the Russian state-controlled natural gas giant Gazprom. Gazprom avia said the plane took off from an aircraft-making plant at Lukhovitsy 110 kilometers (68 miles) southeast of the Russian capital where it had undergone repairs. It was heading to Moscows Vnukovo airport when it crashed eight minutes after takeoff. The cause of the crash wasnt immediately known, but some Russian media reports indicated that both of the planes engines may have failed, probably because of birds getting into them on takeoff. The Investigative Committee, the countrys top state criminal investigation agency, has launched a probe into the crash. The Russian-made Superjet 100, also designated as SSJ100, was hailed by Russian officials as a major achievement for the countrys civil aviation industry when it went into service in 2011 but it has had a patchy safety record. In May 2012, a Sukhoi Superjet 100 slammed into a dormant volcano during a demonstration flight in Indonesia, killing all 45 aboard. The investigation revealed that the crew was unaware of high ground and ignored signals from the terrain warning system while flying in thick clouds. Another Superjet crashed at Moscows Sheremetyevo airport in May 2019, killing 41. It was struck by lightning and made an emergency landing shortly after takeoff. The probe blamed the pilot, concluding that he landed the plane heavy with unburned fuel at excessive speed, resulting in a rough touchdown that sparked a fire. Ever since the plane has entered service it also has been dogged by malfunctions and high maintenance costs that have made many Russian carriers reluctant to buy it. Russias ambitious attempts to widely market the plane abroad have largely failed, and the few foreign customers have phased Superjets out of service. Source: The Associated Press --Agencies",

        "date": "July 13, 2024 11:27 am",
        "content": "Sri Lankas State Minister of Foreign Affairs Tharaka Balasuriya has said that India, and Sri Lanka are working to trade in national currencies, a development that comes even as both sides have been focusing on financial connectivity. Speaking to our diplomatic correspondent Sidhant Sibal, he said,  it makes more sense to pay for those goods in the local currency. So I think its a very good proposal, and it will also be very easy for the Indian tourists to come and they come to Sri Lanka and pay in Indian Rupees. The minister was in Delhi for the BIMSTEC groupings foreign minister retreat. He termed the India Sri Lanka ties being at all time high, and pointed to Indias economic support during the financial crisis his country faced. He explained, Indias role in helping Sri Lanka was fundamental in Sri Lanka making a quick recovery... On BIMSTEC, he backed increased connectivity and focus on FTA within the 7 member grouping. He also spoke on the expansion of the sea bed issue, Katchatheevu island issue etc. Full interview: Sidhant Sibal: How do you see India, Sri Lanka ties? Tharaka Balasuriya: Its always good to be back in Delhi. Last time I was here was for the Raisina dialogue. The relationship between Sri Lanka and India is at an all time high. And we have our bilateral ties are very good. We are collaborating in different spheres. And I think what we need to do, is to make sure that some of the things which we have discussed will materialize in the future very soon. So, I will say that the relationship between Sri Lanka and India is at an all time high. Sidhant Sibal: If you can talk about the current economic situation and the Indian support for your country. Tharaka Balasuriya: I wouldnt say were out of the woods, we still have a long way to go. We our debt restructuring has pretty much finished bilateral and also we have made the agreements with the bondholders, but we need in terms of generating new revenue streams, we need to be looking at new avenues to generate new revenue streams, and the Indias role in helping Sri Lanka was fundamental in Sri Lanka making a quick recovery whereas the multinational institutions should have stepped in, in such a scenario, it took a little bit of time for the multilateral institutions to step in. So it was India who stepped in with the 4.5 billion loan. At that time, we had queues which were two or three miles long, we did not have cash, we were short of medicine. It was very gloomy in Sri Lanka, but now I think you know, if you have visited Sri Lanka, you will see that most things are back to normal. And tourism is thriving. Tourists are back in numbers, he said. The economys doing quite well. In this year, the growth rate was 5.3 in the first quarter. So I think we are on the right track. And of course, in order to achieve that we also had to take very difficult measures, such as raising the taxes , such as not extending the public service and also such as making sure that reducing subsidies and making sure that the pricing was cost based. So we had to go through a tough period but I am optimistic to say that most of it is now behind us, Balasuriya said. And from my overseas travels, maybe one year back when you meet foreign dignitaries, the first thing they ask is hows the situation in Sri Lanka, is there food to eat? most of the foreign dignitaries would ask those questions, but I think that you know now when you visit other countries, most of the foreign dignitaries are asking how are you how able to make such a quick recovery. And also the interest in Sri Lanka from all over is growing due to its location. So Im very optimistic for the medium term and the long term prospects of Sri Lanka, Balasuriya added. Sidhant Sibal: India has also stepped up its support to Sri Lanka in terms of infrastructure development, whether its the oil fields we have been talking about or whether it is providing training to your civil servants. Tharaka Balasuriya: So yes, indeed. I think one of the new revenue streams which we are looking at is pertaining to energy. Both my President and Prime Minister Modi are interested in making Trincomalee an energy hub. We are also looking at grid connectivity with India. So we are looking at connectivity with India in different spheres, people to people connectivity is very important. They are looking at the sea connectivity, maybe restarting the ferry service, maybe on a roll on- roll off basis, ferries, then we are looking at the air connectivity. Now there are flights flying to Chennai, flying to Jaffna but we are also in discussions with India to increase the length of the tarmac, So, large planes can come to Jaffna. Then we are looking at grid connectivity. So, we are looking at connectivity with India in a large way. Sidhant Sibal: Are you also looking with India Sri Lanka and a third country for example, India, Japan and Sri Lanka when it comes to ports are India, Russia and Sri Lanka when it comes to the airports Tharaka Balasuriya: Will you know depends on the industry I think, now if you look at the Mattala International Airport, its India, Sri Lanka and Russia and from the perspective of Sri Lankans, the highest number of tourists come to Sri Lanka from India. Second place number is from Russia. So it makes all the sense to have a tri party agreement and to make sure that more tourists visit Sri Lanka. So I think you know, we should not just be looking at India, but also through India, we should be looking at it as a gateway to the rest of South Asia and also to Southeast Asia. Sidhant Sibal: So, you mentioned connectivity. Now, one connectivity which has been discussed is the land connectivity between India and Sri Lanka. This was one of the key outcomes from the earlier visit of the Sri Lankan President. Hows it going about and whats the view in Sri Lanka regarding it Tharaka Balasuriya: Its proceeding well at the highest level. I think the terms of reference has been done and then also an RFP has been given to Sri Lanka. Now we need to select a consultant in that regard. The bridge itself will, I think, take about four years to build. So that will be a game changer. The BIMSTEC foreign ministers had a time with the Prime Minister Modi ji, and one thing I again emphasized was the bridge. And one point which the Prime Minister made was that if you look at the EU, and if you look at South Asia or Southeast Asia, for that matter, what he pointed out was that the reason that the EU succeeded is simply because of connectivity. So be you know, India and Sri Lanka or be it you know, the road network between India and Myanmar and Thailand, we need to improve connectivity in all its forms. So therell be more business transactions taking place if theres better connectivity. Sidhant Sibal: So you mentioned bridges in four or five years any year youre looking at. Tharaka Balasuriya: I hope construction on the bridge will start as soon as possible. I mean, just think in terms of tourist numbers. I believe that you know if you look at the internal tourists, local tourists, Tamil Nadu gets the most number of tourists, they get about 140 million tourists .Rameshwaram alone gets 10 million tourists. So whether Sri Lanka stands this. Sri Lanka at the moment, we have got about 1.1 million tourists this year. And we are looking to get 2.4 million tourists at the end of the year. I think you know if we have a bridge that 2.4 million or 5 million tourists coming from India can take place within months. Weve been building walls for too long. So we need to build the bridges now. Sidhant Sibal: Sri Lanka plans to expand its seabed. India also plans to expand its seabed, it has put up a proposal as well. Whats the update? Like? Is this an issue that is a thorny one between India and Sri Lanka. Tharaka Balasuriya: No, certainly, not. I think we know each country has a right to claim beyond 200 nautical miles. So if there are areas of contention, those areas can be discussed and resolved bilaterally and we plan on having discussions with India and resolving this matter amicably. Sidhant Sibal: Have you raised it with the Indian side so far? Tharaka Balasuriya: No, this was the BIMSTEC meeting. So it wasnt a bilateral meeting. I did have a meeting with Dr. Ashok. But we didnt discuss this issue. There was other bilateral matters which we discussed in Sidhant Sibal: In the past, has this been discussed because it looks like an old proposal? Tharaka Balasuriya: I dont think that it is a major issue, pertaining to this. We had a similar issue with the Maldivians and then we decided we will discuss with the Maldivian government bilaterally and can be sorted out amicably. So I dont think these are these areas of contention. Sidhant Sibal: Coming back to connectivity, I believe theres so much to talk about connectivity. Financial connectivity, we saw the UPI being agreed on between India and Sri Lanka that will help a lot of Indian tourists go into your country. What are the other proposals? We are looking at the usage of the Indian rupee? Is this also on the anvil? Tharaka Balasuriya: Yes, I think, from the Sri Lanka side we become less dollar dependent. If more Indian tourists come to Sri Lanka, you can pay for the Indian goods in Indian rupees, then you only save a lot of money in terms of the commissions and converting all money to dollars and paying your receipts in dollars. So it makes more sense to pay for those goods locally in the local currency. So I think its a very good proposal, and it will also be very easy for the Indian tourists to come and they come to Sri Lanka and pay in Indian Rupees. Sidhant Sibal: So is there work happening on trading in the national currencies between India and Sri Lanka? Tharaka Balasuriya: Yes, the work is proceeding well and I think by next year we will have identified a certain number of locations where these machinesATMs can be used in order to trade. Sidhant Sibal: There is another issue that maybe Sri Lanka and India might not see eye to eye. One is the visit of the Chinese research vessels. How have you assured New Delhi? Tharaka Balasuriya: Theres a moratorium which is in place and will be until the end of the year, and at the end of the year, we will renew our position. But we are also very interested in developing our own capacity. So I think once we develop our own capacity as a sovereign country, then we can do the research ourselves. So this in terms of Sri Lankas issues is not a major priority. Of course time and again we have stated that we are very interested in Indias security interest. We want to make sure that no country uses Sri Lanka in order to threaten Indias security and we have given that assurance and we will work towards that. But we will also want to trade with other countries. Certainly, India does far more trade with China than you know Sri Lanka does with China. I think Indias trade with China is about 140 billion, whereas Sri Lankas trade with China is a fraction of that. So, perhaps, maybe even Sri Lanka can be an opportunity for these two countries to, to trade. Sidhant Sibal: Any conversation on Katchatheevu island? Tharaka Balasuriya: Thats an internal matter and it has not been raised by the Indian partners and it has been addressed in the 1970s. So I dont think thats a matter which we need to raise up. I think certain Indian politicians raised that matter from a historical perspective, to show that , from Indias perspective, perhaps it was a mistake. But Indians have not raised the matter of Katchatheevu to Sri Lanka and three or four occasions when the matter has been raised by the Indians, once when Sri Lanka was still dominion of the United Kingdom, the Royal Air Force used for bombing purposes, India raised concerns. Then regarding the fishing rights, and then later on there were discussions on the islands being used by the smugglers. But I think historically, the sovereignty of the island has not been questioned. And I think its a matter which is done and dusted. Sidhant Sibal: Last few questions this time on the multilateral aspect. Youre here for the BIMSTEC foreign ministers meeting. Where do you see this grouping going forward? Tharaka Balasuriya: I feel that you know, theres more political will. And I feel that you know, theres 2 billion people which have been represented in the BIMSTEC. And certainly that we need to have closer integration within the BIMSTEC. We have been talking about an FTA within the BIMSTEC. And certainly, certainly, I think A FTA should come into place hopefully, and theres more political will. Now just imagine BIMSTEC alone represents 2 billion people and in Thailand and Myanmar, are also represented in ASEAN. And then ASEAN represents a further 2 billion people. So youre talking about 4 billion people. So I would think that within the next few years, there will be a closer dialogue with the BIMSTEC members and its only seven members so we can have close dialogue. One proposal which was agreed was at the United Nations, in September every year for the BIMSTEC foreign ministers also to meet and have discussions. So this was a foreign ministers retreat. These discussions were very open and frank. It was very informal where our ideas and suggestions were taken into consideration. So we will be looking at the verticals in terms of energy security, in terms of food security, and in terms of the peoples security. And in all these the other subclasses can be put into the three areas. Sidhant Sibal: What are your hopes from the upcoming summit in Thailand? Tharaka Balasuriya: We want the summit to be successful and we want the things to materialize in terms of BIMSTEC itself, it is 27 years old. So the charter was passed during our presidency. But we want something concrete to come out of the group. . Now, if you say that you are a member of the EU, then you feel like youre a member of the EU, you know you can travel freely within each country. So I think you know in order for the BIMSTEC to be successful, people in these countries, ordinary people in these countries need to feel that theres an organization called BIMSTEC, and because of this organization, there are certain benefits that the people are gaining. And we are also hopeful that you know, FTA will come through in the BIMSTEC, there are other areas such as medical visas, e Visas to India are allowed. So, there was an array of areas which we discussed. Source: WION --Agencies",

        "content": "A three-member panel of judges has been named to take up for consideration the Fundamental Rights (FR) petition filed seeking an order to prevent holding of the Presidential Election as the 19th Amendment to the Constitution has not been properly passed in Parliament. Accordingly, the petition filed by Attorney-at-Law Aruna Laksiri, is slated to be taken up for consideration before a bench comprising Chief Justice Jayantha Jayasuriya, Justices Arjuna Obeysekara and Priyantha Fernando. The relevant petition has been fixed for consideration before the aforementioned judge panel on Monday (15), Ada Derana reporter said. The petition argues that the 19th Amendment to the Constitution was not properly passed in Parliament and therefore calls for a referendum to ensure its proper passage. The Election Commission and its members, the General Secretary of Parliament and the Attorney General have been named as respondents. The petitioner claims that through the 19th Amendment to the Constitution, Article 70 of the Constitution has been amended to deprive the President of the power to dissolve an elected Parliament after one year has passed. The petitioner asserts that the amendment has not been approved by a referendum, even though a Supreme Court bench ruled that the amendment should be referred to a referendum. The petitioner points out that the amendment cannot be considered as a law because it has not been approved by a referendum and signed by the President. Therefore, the petitioner argues that it is wrong to continue to accept the 19th Amendment as a law. On Monday (08), the Supreme Court dismissed a fundamental rights (FR) petition seeking an order preventing the calling of a Presidential Election until the Supreme Court delivers its interpretation on the date of the presidential poll. The petition, which was filed by an entrepreneur named C.D. Lenawa last Wednesday (03), had requested that an interim order be issued to prevent the holding of the presidential election within the currently scheduled period until the court delivers its interpretation on the date of the next presidential election.",

        "date": "July 13, 2024 03:43 pm",
        "content": "NASA released on Friday a pair of images taken by the James Webb Space Telescope showing two galaxies - one nicknamed the Penguin and the other the Egg - in the process of merging in sort of a cosmic ballet as the U.S. space agency marked two years since it unveiled the orbiting observatorys first scientific results. Webb, which was launched in 2021 and began collecting data the following year, has reshaped the understanding of the early universe while taking stunning pictures of the cosmos. The two galaxies in the images are situated 326 million light-years from Earth in the constellation Hydra. A light year is the distance light travels in a year, 5.9 trillion miles (9.5 trillion km). We see two galaxies, each a collection of billions of stars. The galaxies are in the process of merging. Thats a common way that galaxies like our own build up over time, to grow from small galaxies - like those that Webb has found shortly after the Big Bang  into mature galaxies like our own Milky Way, said Jane Rigby, NASA Webb senior project scientist. Since becoming operational, Webb has observed galaxies teeming with stars that formed within a few hundred million years of the Big Bang event that marked the beginning of the universe about 13.8 billion years ago. The mingling Penguin and Egg galaxies are collectively known as Arp 142. They are shown in the imagery, opens new tab joined by a haze that is a mix of stars and gas amid their slow-motion merger. The Penguin galaxy, so dubbed because its shape from the perspective of the telescope resembles that flightless bird, including a beak-like region, is formally called NGC 2936. It is a spiral-shaped galaxy, now a bit distorted. The Egg galaxy, also named for its shape, is formally called NGC 2937. It is a compact elliptical-shaped galaxy. Together, their appearance is suggestive of a penguin guarding its egg. Their interaction, according to NASA, was set in motion between 25 and 75 million years ago, and they are expected to become a single galaxy hundreds of millions of years from now. Webb has detected the earliest-known galaxies and has provided insight into areas such as the composition of planets beyond our solar system, known as exoplanets, and the nature of star-forming regions in the cosmos. This mission has allowed us to look back to the most distant galaxies ever observed and understand the very early universe in a new way, said Mark Clampin, astrophysics division director at NASA headquarters. For example, with Webb, weve found that these very early galaxies are more massive and brighter than we expected, posing the question: How did they get so big so quickly? Webb was designed to be more sensitive than its Hubble Space Telescope predecessor, which also is continuing its work. Webb looks at the universe mainly in the infrared, while Hubble has examined it primarily at optical and ultraviolet wavelengths. Webb is the largest, most powerful telescope ever put in space. It specializes in capturing infrared light - wavelengths of light longer than our eyes can see. With its incredible sensitivity to those wavelengths, weve been able to look back into the early universe in a way previous missions couldnt, see through dust and gas into the heart of star formation, and examine the composition of exoplanet atmospheres like never before, Clampin said. Looking ahead, Clampin added, Some of Webbs most exciting investigations will be the things we havent even thought of yet. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "date": "July 13, 2024 04:50 pm",
        "content": "A Pakistan court acquitted former Prime Minister Imran Khan and his wife on Saturday on charges of unlawful marriage, a day after his party won more seats in parliament, ramping up pressure on the countrys fragile government. Imran Khan and Bibi sahiba are acquitted, Khan lawyer Naeem Panjutha posted on X, using an honorific for Khans wife, Bushra Khan, also known as Bushra Bibi. Khans Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party said there were no more cases pending against Khan, 71, to keep him in jail after the acquittal by the court in the capital Islamabad. The couple were sentenced to seven years in February when a court found them guilty of breaking Islamic law by failing to observe the required interval between Bibis divorce from a previous marriage and her marriage to Khan. It was not immediately clear whether Khan and Bibi, both in jail, would be released following Saturdays decision. All four jail sentences Khan received ahead of a February national election have now been overturned or suspended. The embattled leader, in jail since August, was acquitted this month of charges of leaking state secrets. The other two sentences have been suspended. But a court cancelled his bail last week related to violence in May 2023, where his supporters attacked military installations to protest against his arrest. It was not immediately clear whether Khan had been remanded in that case to keep him in jail. Khan is named as an accused party in several other cases, including the one violence against the state. Bibi is an accused party on at least one other charge of the couple accepting land as a bribe from a real estate developer when Khan was in office. The PTI warned that keeping him in jail despite Saturdays decision to grant bail on Saturday would lead to another political crisis. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "date": "July 13, 2024 07:12 pm",
        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe emphasized his commitment to building a robust economic framework that ensures long-term stability for future generations, steering away from short-term solutions that could risk economic collapse. He made these remarks today (13) during the inauguration of the state-of-the-art swimming pool at the Anuradhapura Central College. Reflecting on past economic and political crises, President Wickremesinghe highlighted the necessity of a national-level political apparatus capable of strategic governance beyond the five year electoral cycles. He underscored the need for governance focused not merely on short-term power dynamics but on sustainable national development. During the ceremony, President Wickremesinghe inaugurated the state-of-the-art swimming pool and engaged with students participating in various activities. He also formally handed over the swimming pool premises to the Anuradhapura Central College and congratulated students who excelled in the 2023 GCE Advanced Level Examination, personally acknowledging their achievements. Principal Mr. Percy Mahanama presented a donation of Rs. 10,000 to the Presidents Fund, contributed by the students of the Anuradhapura Central College, as a token of appreciation. President Ranil Wickremesinghe further commented; The Government, along with support from the Alumni Association, has contributed to the construction of this swimming pool, providing your school with a valuable addition. This school, where the educational reforms initiated by Mr. C. W. W. Kannangara began in the North Central Province, holds the distinction of being its first Madhya Maha Vidyalaya. Since then, the school has made significant strides. The principal has requested a three-storied building, and I will personally notify the Ministry of Education to facilitate its construction. As we approach the 77th anniversary of the college and celebrate the completion of the swimming pool, I am pleased to announce that the Presidents office is actively working towards establishing a fully-equipped fitness center for the college. During a students speech on behalf of the school, the aspiration for a better future was prominently expressed. This aspiration is both reasonable and timely, especially considering recent years. It is imperative that we strategize on how to build this envisioned future. By averting bankruptcy, we have achieved our first milestone. However, continuing with the current economic trajectory risks accumulating unsustainable levels of debt, jeopardizing the future these students aspire to. In the next 15 years, we could potentially face a severe economic crisis unless we chart a sustainable course forward. As a nation, we must decide whether to advance or risk economic collapse once more. Considering that you will reside here for at least another 50 years, our focus as a government should extend beyond 2050 and aim towards securing prosperity by 2075. Therefore, we are planning to transition our countrys economy from one reliant on imports to one driven by exports. This necessitates a fundamental overhaul of our existing economic structures, for which we have introduced the Economic Transformation Act. Central to this transformation is the agricultural modernization program, crucial for revitalizing our economy. Thanks to the dedication of our farmers, who received essential fertilizer support, we achieved successful harvests in 2022, 2023, and 2024. In recognition of their contributions, we launched the inheritance tax exemption program, benefiting farmers across the North Central Province. Looking ahead, the global population is projected to increase by an additional 2 billion by 2050, necessitating a focus on utilizing modern technology to maximize agricultural output and ensure food security worldwide. From these arid regions, we aim to achieve self-sufficiency in rice production, which will drive economic prosperity in Anuradhapura, Dambulla, and Vavuniya. Furthermore, these provinces possess significant potential for solar energy projects and tourism development. Embracing innovation, we are embarking on ambitious initiatives such as the Trincomalee port development project in collaboration with India, which will also benefit Anuradhapura. In line with our forward-thinking approach, plans are underway to establish three new technological universities, supported by foreign institutions offering technical expertise. Embracing advancements in artificial intelligence, we are poised to chart a new course towards a prosperous future. As we navigate this transformative journey, it is imperative to continuously reassess and innovate for sustained growth and development. Some politicians focus solely on gaining power for a five-year term or on ousting their rivals from office. This narrow approach to politics has historically led to economic and political crises in our country. Through collaboration across political divides, I successfully revitalized the national economy. This effort marked the establishment of a national-level thinking group for the first time in our history. Such a system is crucial for our future, transcending partisan interests to prioritize the nations well-being. Regardless of political affiliation, it is essential that every representative prioritizes the nations interests. Our collective success as a nation hinges on the decisions we make in the coming years. Therefore, I urge everyone to focus on the future and work towards our shared prosperity. State Minister of Finance Shehan Semasinghe; Today marks a significant milestone as the swimming pool of this school, which holds a special place in Anuradhapura, is handed over to the students. The completion of this project faced challenges amidst recent turbulent conditions in the country. However, following successful economic stabilization efforts led by President Ranil Wickremesinghe, funding was secured to finalize its construction. Under the Presidents strategic initiatives, comprehensive measures were implemented to advance the nations economic recovery while restoring stability. Through effective decision-making and a partnership with the International Monetary Fund, the government swiftly restored both the economy and livelihoods. President Wickremesinghe continues to spearhead reforms aimed at safeguarding the economy from future collapses, with new legislation and programs already underway. Concurrently, transformative initiatives are enhancing infrastructure across education, healthcare, and the broader economy, fostering a brighter outlook for the nations future. The ceremony was attended by North Central Province Governor Mahipala Herath, Members of Parliament S.M. Chandrasena, Duminda Dissanayake, Rohana Bandara, former Minister P. Harrison, former Chief Minister S.M. Ranjith, Anuradhapura Central College Principal Mr. Percy Mahanama, members of the staff, parents, alumni, and students.",

        "date": "July 13, 2024 10:14 pm",
        "content": "An Israeli airstrike killed at least 71 Palestinians in a designated humanitarian zone in Gaza on Saturday, the enclaves health ministry said, in an attack that Israel said targeted Hamas military chief Mohammed Deif. It was unclear whether Deif was killed. We are still checking and verifying the results of the strike, an Israeli military official told reporters. The militant Islamist group Hamas said in a statement that Israeli claims it had targeted leaders of the group were false and aimed at justifying the attack, which was the deadliest Israeli attack in Gaza in weeks. Displaced people sheltering in the area said their tents were torn down by the force of the strike, describing bodies and body parts strewn on the ground. I couldnt even tell where I was or what was happening, said Sheikh Youssef, a resident of Gaza City who is currently displaced in the Al-Mawasi area. I left the tent and looked around, all the tents were knocked down, body parts, bodies everywhere, elderly women thrown on the floor, young children in pieces, he told Reuters. The Israeli military said the strike against Deif also targeted Rafa Salama, the commander of Hamas Khan Younis Brigade, describing them as two of the masterminds of the Oct. 7 attack on southern Israel that triggered the nine-month war in Gaza. Deif has survived seven Israeli assassination attempts, the most recent in 2021 and has topped Israels most wanted list for decades, held responsible for the deaths of dozens of Israelis in suicide bombings. The Gaza health ministry said at least 71 Palestinians were killed in the strike and 289 injured, the deadliest toll in weeks in the conflict-shattered enclave. Al-Mawasi is a designated humanitarian area that the Israeli army has repeatedly urged Palestinians to head to after issuing evacuation orders from other areas. Reuters footage showed ambulances racing towards the area amidst clouds of smoke and dust. Displaced people, including women and children, were fleeing in panic, some holding belongings in their hands. The Israeli military published an aerial photo of the site, which Reuters was not immediately able to verify, where it said terrorists hid among civilians. The location of the strike was an open area surrounded by trees, several buildings, and sheds, it said in a statement. The Israeli military official said the area was not a tent complex, but an operational compound run by Hamas and that several more militants were there, guarding Deif. Many of those wounded in the strike, including women and children, were taken to the nearby Nasser Hospital, which hospital officials said had been overwhelmed and was no longer able to function due to the intensity of the Israeli offensive and an acute shortage of medical supplies. The hospital is full of patients, its full of wounded, we cant find beds for people, said Atef al-Hout, director of the hospital, adding that it was the only one still operating in southern Gaza. Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant was holding special consultations, his office said, in light of developments in Gaza. It was unclear how the strike would affect ceasefire talks underway in Doha and Cairo. ATTACK HIT CALM AREA, WITNESSES SAY The Hamas-run media office said at least 100 people had been killed and wounded in the Khan Younis attack, including members of the Civil Emergency Service. A senior Hamas official did not confirm whether Deif had been present and called the Israeli allegations nonsense. All the martyrs are civilians and what happened was a grave escalation of the war of genocide, backed by the American support and world silence, Sami Abu Zuhri told Reuters, adding the strike showed Israel was not interested in reaching a ceasefire deal. Critics have accused Israel of committing genocide against Palestinians, which Israel denies. It characterises its actions as self-defense to prevent another attack like Oct. 7, though the International Court of Justice ordered Israel in January to take action to prevent acts of genocide. Hamas-led militants killed 1,200 people and took more than 250 hostages in the cross-border raid into southern Israel on Oct. 7, according to Israeli tallies. Israel has retaliated with military action in Gaza that has killed more than 38,000 Palestinians, medical authorities in Gaza say. Separately on Saturday, at least 17 Palestinians were killed in an Israeli attack on a prayer hall at a Gaza camp for displaced people in west Gaza City, Palestinian health officials said. Witnesses said the Khan Younis attack came as a surprise as the area had been calm, adding more than one missile had been fired. Some of the wounded who were being evacuated were rescue workers, they said. Theyre all gone, my whole familys gone ... where are my brothers? Theyre all gone, theyre all gone. Theres no one left, said one tearful woman, who did not give her name. Rising up the Hamas ranks over 30 years, Deif developed the groups network of tunnels and its bomb-making expertise, Hamas sources say. In March, Israel said it killed Deifs deputy, Marwan Issa. Hamas has since neither confirmed, nor denied his death. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "date": "July 14, 2024 07:04 am",
        "content": "Donald Trump was shot in the right ear during a campaign rally on Saturday, sparking panic in the crowd and spattering the Republican presidential candidates blood across his face, before he emerged and pumped his fist in the air appearing to mouth the words Fight! Fight! Fight! The shooter was dead, one rally attendee was killed and two other spectators were injured, the Secret Service said in a statement. I was shot with a bullet that pierced the upper part of my right ear, Trump said on his Truth Social platform. Much bleeding took place. As the shots rang out, Trump grabbed his right ear with his right hand, then brought his hand down to look at it before dropping to his knees behind the podium before Secret Service agents swarmed and covered him. He emerged about a minute later, his red Make America Great Again hat knocked off and could be heard saying wait, wait, before agents ushered him into a waiting vehicle. The Secret Service and the former presidents campaign said Trump was safe following the shooting in Butler, Pennsylvania, about 30 miles (50 km) north of Pittsburgh. The shooters identity and motive were not immediately clear. Leading Republicans and Democrats quickly condemned the violence. The shots appeared to come from outside the area secured by the Secret Service, the agency said. An audience member was also dead, and another person was in critical condition, a Washington Post reporter said on social media, citing the Butler County district attorney. The shooting occurred less than four months before the Nov. 5 election, when Trump faces an election rematch with Democratic President Joe Biden. President Trump thanks law enforcement and first responders for their quick action during this heinous act. He is fine and is being checked out at a local medical facility. More details will follow, spokesperson Steven Cheung said in a statement. Trump had just started his speech when gunshots erupted and Trump and other rally attendees hit the deck. Secret Service agents swarmed around him and Trump disappeared behind the podium for about one minute before he was rushed to the waiting vehicle. Trump and Biden are locked in a close election rematch, with most opinion polls including those by ReutersIpsos showing the two evenly matched. Biden said in a statement: Theres no place for this kind of violence in America. We must unite as one nation to condemn it. Ron Moose, a Trump supporter who was in the crowd, described the chaos: I heard about four shots and I saw the crowd go down and then Trump ducked also real quick. Then the Secret Service all jumped and protected him as soon as they could. We are talking within a second they were all protecting him. Moose said he then saw a man running and being chased by officers in military uniforms. He said he heard additional shots, but was unsure who fired them. He noted that by then snipers had set up on the roof of a warehouse behind the stage. The BBC interviewed a man who described himself as an eyewitness, saying he saw a man armed with a rifle crawling up a roof near the event. The person, who the BBC did not identify, said he and the people he was with started pointing at the man, trying to alert security. I am thinking to myself, why is Trump still speaking. Why have they not pulled him off stage, said the man, who was wearing a red Trump hat. Next thing you know, five shots rang out. REPUBLICANS, DEMOCRATS DECRY VIOLENCE Trump is due to receive his partys formal nomination at the Republican National Convention, which kicks off in Milwaukee on Monday. This horrific act of political violence at a peaceful campaign rally has no place in this country and should be unanimously and forcefully condemned, Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson said on social media. Democratic Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said he was horrified by what happened and was relieved Trump was safe. Political violence has no place in our country, he said. A Secret Service spokesperson said on social media: The Secret Service has implemented protective measures and the former president is safe ... This is now an active Secret Service investigation and further information will be released when available. CNN reported that Trump was injured, but gave no other details. It was not clear how or what injuries he may have sustained. The venue was abandoned with chairs knocked over and yellow police tape around the stage. A helicopter flew above and law enforcement officers walked through the area, the video feed showed. Armed law enforcement officers were also seen on a roof near the stage where Trump was standing. Bidens campaign was working to pause its television ads and halting all other outbound communication, a campaign official said on Saturday. Trump, who served as president from 2017-2021, easily bested his rivals for the Republican nomination early in the campaign and has largely unified around him the party that had briefly wavered in support after his supporters attacked the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, attempting to overturn his 2020 election defeat. The businessman and former reality television star entered the year facing a raft of legal worries, including four separate criminal prosecutions. He was found guilty in late May of trying to cover up hush money payments to a porn star, but the other three prosecutions he faces -- including two for his attempts to overturn his defeat -- have been ground to a halt by various factors including a Supreme Court decision early this month that found him to be partly immune to prosecution.

        "content": "Stressing the need to hold a discussion on the fishermen issue between Sri Lanka and India, Sri Lankas State Minister of Foreign Affairs Tharaka Balasuriya emphasized that both countries must look into this long-lasting issue from a sustainable perspective. During an interview with Indias NDTV, State Minister Balasuriya expressed that this issue has persisted for a very long period of time. In the Foreign Ministry, I was reading some old notes of when the Indian Prime Minister Neru visited Prime Minister Bandaranaike in 1950s, and top in the agenda was the fishermens issue. So, this has persisted for a long period of time.., Balasuriya said. Furthermore, the Foreign Affairs State Minister stressed that the people in the North of Sri Lanka are the most affected community as a result of this problem, adding that the Tamil Nadu government needs to realize that. If you see the problem, its not one or two Indian fishermen who come for fishing in the Sri Lankan waters. It is thousands of fishermen coming for fishing in the Sri Lankan waters You need to realize that the people in the North of Sri Lanka have suffered the most. I think the Tamil Nadu government also needs to realize that. They have suffered as a result of the war which was in place for a period of over 30 years and now they are suffering because they cant make a livelihood from fishing, he stressed. Balasuriya also weighed that it is required to halt some of the destructive fishing practices carried out by the Indian fishermen in Sri Lankan waters. Also I think some of the practices carried out by the Indian fishermen such as bottom trawling, we need to stop that, he said. Commenting further, the Sri Lankan State Minister said: So both countries need to get together in order to address this problem. I think thats why the greater connectivity of Sri Lanka and India is also good.  Usually the people who are in the fishingif ones father is a fisherman, the son also becomes a fisherman. If theres more connectivity in other areas of opportunities like tourism where they can even make more money then less people will get into fishing, Balasuriya added. India and Sri Lanka has to look at fishing in such a sustainable perspective, he highlighted.

Commenting regarding the matter at a press briefing today, Wickramaratne condemned the assassination attempt on the ex-US President as an attack on democracy, and siaid that politicians should step away from engaging in such politics. Similarly in Sri Lanka, some political parties tend to use these types of tactics when they cant complete their political agendas. They have attacked the candidates in the past as well, he added. Furthermore, Wickremaratne said: As soon as I heard this incident, I clearly told the government that they must look into the security of Sajith Premadasa and they must be accountable for that. We are a democratic country. A democratic country carries out the politics with public mandate and elections, but not with weapons. Thats why I am making this request to the government. We cannot have any doubts about Sajith Premadasas safety, the MP added. Speaking further, the Parliamentarian also alleged that some parties have created unnecessary unrest in the country regarding whether the election will be postponed or not, while emphasizing that it is crucial for the elections to be held on time.",

        "content": "Fitness guru Richard Simmons has died at age 76, multiple media outlets reported, including ABC News and TMZ. The reports said his housekeeper found him unresponsive on Saturday morning and Los Angeles police were called. TMZ reported that police were treating it as a natural death. Los Angeles police said it could not confirm Simmons death. Born Milton Teagle Richard Simmons, the flamboyant fitness instructor became a household name and pioneered gyms as safe places for people who werent already in perfect shape. He revealed in a series of social media posts this year that he had been diagnosed with skin cancer. In a post on X in March he declared, I have some news to tell you. Please dont be sad. I am dying. Oh I can see your faces now. There was no other context for the statement and he later apologized for the media stir his comments made. Through his representative he said that the sole purpose of the post was meant to be inspirational. Simmons, who grew up in the French quarter of New Orleans before settling in California, weighed 268 pounds (121.56 kg) when he graduated from high school, his website said. His own story of struggling with weight loss, where he tried everything from fad diets to laxatives before settling on exercise and better lifestyle choices, inspired millions to do the same. Over the years he produced a series of aerobics dancing fitness videos and had a chain of fitness studios, and hosted the Richard Simmons Show from 1980-1984, and the program won four Daytime Emmys. In recent years, the once ubiquitous fitness instructor seemed to have stepped out of the public spotlight, where he frequently made appearances on daytime talk shows, but he maintained a large following on the internet. Simmons posted on Facebook Friday to thank fans for their birthday wishes, as he turned 76. So many of you have sent me birthday wishes on my Facebook and other platforms, he wrote. I really appreciate that. I dont know when your birthday is but I wish you a happy and healthy birthday! Source: Reuters --Agencies",

Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone Ltd. has secured an in-principle approval from the Vietnamese government for a greenfield development in Da Nang, Karan Adani, Managing Director of the company, said in an interview. The project, which will have container terminals and multipurpose berths to handle various types of cargo, is at an early stage of planning and the total investment required hasnt been finalized yet, he said. This will be the fourth international port asset for the Adani group after Haifa in Israel, Colombo in Sri Lanka and the Port of Dar es Salaam in Tanzania. On Friday, Adanis new mega port in southern India saw the arrival of its maiden mother ship and the company wants to accelerate the expansion of the facility in a bid to grab a bigger share of the international maritime trade thats currently dominated by China. The idea is to make India a maritime hub, Karan, the elder son of Gautam Adani, said. We are targeting countries that are high on manufacturing or high on population, which will lead to high consumption. We are focusing on export volumes in these countries. Adani Ports is the largest port operator in India. It gets about 5 per cent of its total volume from international operations and wants to increase the ratio to 10 per cent by 2030, Karan Adani said. The company is looking at opportunities in the Middle East, Southeast Asia, East Africa, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Maldives, Vietnam and Cambodia as these are regions where trade is coming to India, he said.",

        "content": "Its the final week of MasterChef Australia 2024, and fans are on the edge of their seats as the competition reaches its thrilling climax. The top three finalists battling it out for the title are Savindri Perera, Josh Perry, and Nat Thaipun. Each of these chefs has showcased remarkable skills and creativity throughout the season, making the finale a must-watch event. Sri Lankan born Savindri Perera or Sav as she is best known, made her journey on MasterChef nothing short of spectacular drawing the attention for her Sri Lankan dishes throughout the competition. Describing her cooking style as rustic, generous and colourful, Savs love of cooking amped up around age 12 after discovering Nigella. She lists onion, garlic and curry leaves as her holy trinity, nothing happens in Sri Lankan cooking without them. Last round she Prepared Sri Lankan Chicken curry. She said My version of Ammis Chicken Curry  Spice rubbed pan roasted chicken breast  Ala kiri hodi potato puree  Picked leaf salad with pickled onions I always knew this was going to be my hardest cook in this kitchen  and it was. Seeing my mums photo in the little wooden chest just made me remember just how much of her is in me. In the photo my mother was making chicken curry, ala kiri hodi, rice  a kale sambal loaded with red onion. I decided I wanted to do a version of my mums chicken curry that looks nothing like a chicken curry. The thinking process for me was to show how lve changed in the competition. Sav on day 1 wouldnt have dared to do this. I wanted to capture the flavour profiles I love and present them in a different way. While I managed to do that, a big part of me feels like I let myself down  let myself Mum down even though thats not necessarily true. I wanted more time to refine the chicken, my potato puree was not smooth because I baked the potato instead of boiling it as I usually do. I am happy to openly admit these errors because theres no shame in admitting your short comings. The presentation is not executed how I intended  to be honest with you for a while it felt like I couldnt even move because of how bound by grief I was in that moment. The whole point of this dish was to change how lm doing things. Furthermore, Sav recently shared a vulnerable post on Instagram and said that she was grieving her mothers death at the time of auditions, which further led her to question her decision to go on MasterChef. One of the hardest battles I had to overcome before competing was severe body dysmorphia, Sav penned on social media. Sav revealed that shes been in therapy for her body dysmorphia, but still struggles to come to terms with it. It is sometimes really really hard for me to watch myself purely because of the intense fatphobia I have towards myself, she explained. The hatred I have towards my body at times is awful. Years of therapy later  its better but its not easy. That self loathing manifested in a way that led to me convincing myself that I dont deserve to take up space in this world. Sometimes I see comments online that often talk about how I dont smile, how my voice is awful, how my smile is awful.. and whilst I dont engage with these things, I still see it  while I can ignore it on most days, after a while I wonder if its actually true when I know it isnt. The MasterChef contestant said that she decided to share her story in the hope that it would help others who are going through something similar. The MasterChef Australia tables will be turned with the top three challenging MasterChef Australia judges Andy Allen, Poh Ling Yeow and Jean-Christophe Novelli with a mystery box on Sunday (14). Pezza, Nat and Sav will then compete against Andy, Poh and Jean-Christophe in a MasterChef Australia classic: the team relay. Sofia Levin and three returning contestants will decide which team reigns supreme. Monday (15) is semi-final day and the final three will take on a massive service challenge. Pezza, Nat and Sav will have to prepare a three-course menu to impress the judges, guest chef Curtis Stone and 60 diners. For one contestant, it will be the end of their MasterChef Australia journey, with the two top cooks winning their place in the grand finale. Tuesday is the MasterChef Australia grand finale. The top two will go head-to-head over two huge rounds and in the final challenge of the season internationally renowned chef and Michelin star trailblazer, Clare Smyth, will set an unforgettable four-hour pressure test.

A message shared widely on the X platform reads: Per the Butler Police Department the Trump shooter has been arrested at the scene and has been identified as Mark Violets, an Antifa member. It was accompanied by a picture of Italian journalist Marco Violi. He is the editor of romagiallorossa.it, a fan website for the Italian soccer club AS Roma. The FBI said early on Sunday it had identified 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks of Bethel Park, Pennsylvania, as the subject involved in Saturdays shooting. The Secret Service said the suspect was shot dead by agents. I categorically deny that I am involved in this situation, Rome-based Violi wrote in an Instagram story, saying he had been woken up in the middle of the night by Instagram and X notifications related to the post. Violi blamed two Italian X users for spreading the false information against him, and said that he would go to the police on Monday to report them and the media who picked up on their message. Calling the X users stalkers, Violi said he had been their target for years, and that criminal proceedings against them are ongoing.

        "title": "Who is Thomas Matthew Crooks, the suspected Trump rally shooter",
        "date": "July 14, 2024 10:05 pm",
        "content": "The FBI identified 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks of Bethel Park, Pennsylvania as the suspect in the attempted assassination of former U.S. President Donald Trump at a campaign rally. The suspect was shot and killed by the Secret Service seconds after he allegedly fired shots toward a stage where Trump was speaking on Saturday in Butler, Pennsylvania. The FBI said it was working to determine a motive for the attack. One rally attendee died and two other spectators were critically injured. Trump was shot in the ear. State voter records show that Crooks was a registered Republican. The upcoming Nov. 5 election in which Trump is challenging President Joe Biden would have been the first time Crooks had been old enough to vote in a presidential race. When Crooks was 17, he made a 15 donation to ActBlue, a political action committee that raises money for left-leaning and Democratic politicians, according to a 2021 Federal Election Commission filing. The donation was earmarked for the Progressive Turnout Project, a national group that rallies Democrats to vote. The groups did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. Crooks father, Matthew Crooks, 53, told CNN that he was trying to figure out what happened and would wait until he spoke to law enforcement before speaking about his son. In Bethel Park, about an hour away from where the shooting occurred, the streets surrounding the Crookss home were blocked off by law enforcement authorities. Mary and Stanley Priselac were standing on the porch of their nearby brick ranch-style home, trying to process the events of the last day and the spotlight now on their typically quiet residential neighborhood. Nothing happens on the street, everybody kind of minds their own business, said Stanley Priselac, 72. Everybody is kind of shocked, surprised, some dismay. Theres never been a gun issue. Theres never been the police being called, said Mary Priselac, 67. You kind of have to wonder what didnt he get in life? What led to this extreme? Thomas Crooks graduated in 2022 from Bethel Park High School, according to a statement from the Bethel Park School District received by local ABC affiliate WJET-TV. Our school district will cooperate fully with the active law enforcement investigation surrounding this case, and as such, we are limited in what we can publicly disclose, the statement read. The school district did not immediately respond to an inquiry from Reuters. Crooks received a 500 star award from the National Math and Science Initiative, according to the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review newspaper. A 2022 graduation ceremony video cited by the New York Times shows Crooks receiving his high school diploma to some applause. Video from that ceremony posted online shows Crooks with glasses in a black graduation gown and posing with a school official. Reuters could not immediately verify the authenticity of the video. Law enforcement officials said on Saturday that Crooks carried no identification to the site of the shooting and had to be identified using other methods. Were looking at photographs right now and were trying to run his DNA and get biometric confirmation, Kevin Rojek, FBI special agent in charge, said during a press briefing. Reuters could not immediately identify social media accounts or other online postings by Crooks. Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, did not immediately respond to questions on whether the platforms had removed any accounts related to the suspect. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "date": "July 15, 2024 09:08 am",
        "content": "The leader of the Nepals largest communist party, Khadga Prasad Oli, was named the Himalayan nations new prime minister on Sunday following the collapse of a previous coalition government. A statement issued by the presidents office said Oli will take his oath of office on Monday. A veteran politician and three-time prime minister, Oli will be leading a coalition government made up of his Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist Leninist) and the Nepali Congress party, the two largest parties in Nepal. The last government headed by Pushpa Kamal Dahal collapsed on Friday after Olis party, which had been a part of the coalition, withdrew its support to join the new partnership. Oli would have to seek vote of confidence in parliament to continue in office within a month. The two parties in the new alliance have more than half the members in parliament required to prove their majority. Olis biggest challenge as prime minister will be balancing Nepals relationship with its giant neighbors India and China, as both seek to wield influence over the small nation. Landlocked Nepal is surrounded by India on three sides and imports all of its oil and most supplies from India. It also shares a border with China. Oli, 72, was born in a village in east Nepal and has been involved in politics since he was young. He worked up the ranks of the communist party and was jailed a total of 14 years for opposing the autocratic rule of Nepals monarchs. The royals had banned political parties until 1990, when street protests forced then-King Birendra to hold free elections that turned Nepal into a constitutional monarchy, which was formally abolished in 2008. Oli has made regular trips abroad for treatment of kidneys and has had kidney transplant surgeries. Source: The Associated Press --Agencies",

        "title": "Sri Lankas economic recovery underscores power of working together for the greater good  President",
        "date": "July 15, 2024 09:26 am",
        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe emphasized that true revolutions are not about violence or destruction, but about creating a foundation where people can advance with dignity. Pointing out that the Urumaya program has been able to create that background for the people of Sri Lanka, the President said that everyone should unite with the Urumaya program, which will popularize the genuine socialist ideals beyond partisan politics. The President made these remarks at the Urumaya freehold land deeds award ceremony held at Tambuttegama Mahaweli Stadium, where he symbolically awarded 47 freehold land deeds. Accordingly, 4,012 individuals across nine Mahaweli divisions in the Anuradhapura district received their freehold land rights. President Ranil wickremesinghe further elaborated; I visited Tambuttegama area 50 years ago, in 1974. At that time, there was a contention within the Bandaranaike family regarding who would step forward after the passing of Mr. Ratnamalana, a member of the Left Front who was active here. Anura Bandaranaike expressed his intention to take up the mantle. Opposition leader J.R. Jayawardena asked Mr. Jayawardena if he would lend his support, to which Mr. Jayawardena agreed. However, Mrs. Chandrika and Mr. Vijaya Kumaratunga opposed this. Eventually, Mrs. Bandaranaike presented Mr. Ratnamalanas son. Mr. Adhikari from the United National Party arrived in this province for our interim election. During that period, there was no any development in these provinces. I returned to Tambuttegama in 1984, its after a decade, during which time we had formed a government and appointed Mr. Adhikari as Deputy Minister under Minister Gamini Dissanayake. Mr. Gamini Dissanayake entrusted him with the Mahaweli H zone, and with the support of all of us, he worked towards its development. Mr. Gamini Dissanayake inaugurated Tambuttegama as the new main town of the Kalawewa area under the Mahaweli Development Program. On that day, Madhya Maha Vidyalaya, a new bus stand, a fully equipped hospital, the Deputy Governors office, and shops were all inaugurated. I attended the event as the Minister of Education, alongside Mr. M.H. Mohammad, the Minister of Transport, and Mr. Ranjith Atapattu, the Minister of Health. Prior to this, at the request of Mr. Adhikari, I had arranged for Tambuttegama Maha Vidyalaya to receive advanced education facilities and a new building. Today, Tambuttegama has blossomed into a highly developed city. When I first visited the province in 1984, my friend MP Anura Dissanayake was a student at that school. Through our efforts to enhance its educational standards, he excelled in his exams and subsequently attended the University of Kelaniya, which we helped establish. Now, he has the privilege of working alongside us in Parliament. When the Dhawala Pathrika was introduced, it faced significant opposition from the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna. Today, I take pride in seeing one of its members emerge as a presidential candidate, a testament to the success of our education system. During my visit today, the principal mentioned that Tambuttegama College still lacks adequate resources. Therefore, plans are underway to construct a new building for the college. Our efforts have propelled significant advancements in these provinces. Several Irrigation Ministers and Mahaweli Ministers have originated from this province, reflecting our collective progress. While MP Anura Dissanayake and I collaborate in Parliament, our political affiliations differ. He recently affirmed this in Parliament, identifying Mahinda Rajapaksa as the key figure in his political stance. This divergence doesnt concern me; whether someone aligns with Rajapaksa or the United National Party or other parties, our imperative remains collaboration for the common good. I recall when Mrs. Chandrika Bandaranaike was there to give the presidency to Mr. Anura Bandaranaike when she gave up the office of President. At that moment, Mr. Anura Dissanayake courageously stepped forward and requested Mr. Mahinda Rajapaksa to take up the opportunity, supporting him during the election. For me, their political affiliations are not an issue. Today, we stand united beyond political divides. Whether they are Rajapaksa supporters or United National Party supporters, our common goal is the recovery of our country. Recently, the United States acknowledged Sri Lankas remarkable progress, urging other nations to follow suit. Two years ago, our political system faced a collapse. Which country faces a three-day search for a prime minister? Such disruptions are unheard of in politics. Moreover, in any country, a single-seat holder becoming president is unprecedented. Despite these challenges, through collaborative efforts devoid of political agendas, we have stabilized the countrys economy. This achievement underscores the power of working together for the greater good. Before that, we experienced various political conflicts. However, during times of national crisis, we cannot afford division. If we do not unite, there will be no country left to govern. Over the past two years, we have focused on providing relief to the people. Instead of remaining in the depths of economic despair, we introduced a program three times larger than Samurdhi called Aswesuma, bringing comfort to the nation. Government employees received an allowance of Rs.10, 000. In 2015, following the salary increase I implemented as Prime Minister, this allowance was granted for the first time. We also bolstered agriculture by ensuring farmers had ample fertilizer. The economic crisis affected all citizens, but as we rebuild, we must not forget those who struggled. The farmers of this province have consistently yielded good harvests, which has bolstered our economic recovery. As a token of appreciation, we have initiated a ground-breaking program to grant freehold land rights, a move emblematic of true socialism in our democratic socialist nation. This echoes Chinas approach to developing its economy through traditional socialism, ensuring prosperity reaches the people. We have initiated a program aimed at establishing an export-driven economy in our nation. This endeavour ensures that people are empowered with rightsa true testament to socialism and revolution. Unlike past upheavals involving violence and destruction, this is a peaceful and transformative revolution. Through the Urumaya program, 2 million people in our country will secure their land rights. I urge everyone to embrace this opportunity and advance with pride. This marks your liberation, freeing you from dependency on officials. Hence, I invite all to support and participate in this initiative without political divisions. --PMD--",

Accordingly, the petition filed by Attorney-at-Law Aruna Laksiri, is slated to be taken up for consideration before a bench comprising Chief Justice Jayantha Jayasuriya, Justices Arjuna Obeysekara and Priyantha Fernando. The relevant petition has been fixed for consideration before the aforementioned judge panel today (15). The petitioner argues that the 19th Amendment to the Constitution was not properly passed in Parliament and therefore calls for a referendum to ensure its proper passage. The Election Commission and its members, the General Secretary of Parliament and the Attorney General have been named as respondents. The petitioner claims that through the 19th Amendment to the Constitution, Article 70 of the Constitution has been amended to deprive the President of the power to dissolve an elected Parliament after one year has passed. The petitioner asserts that the amendment has not been approved by a referendum, even though a Supreme Court bench ruled that the amendment should be referred to a referendum. The petitioner points out that the amendment cannot be considered as a law because it has not been approved by a referendum and signed by the President. Therefore, the petitioner argues that it is wrong to continue to accept the 19th Amendment as a law.",

        "content": "Sri Lanka Muslim Congress leader and MP Rauff Hakeem on Sunday said that his country is ever grateful to India for extending huge financial assistance to Sri Lanka when it faced economic turmoil a couple of years ago. Although the economy of Sri Lanka bounced back after the Eelam war, the island nation faced a massive economic crisis a couple of years ago because of mounting debts and was unable to settle loans received from foreign nations. It was at this juncture that India extended huge financial assistance to Sri Lanka when it faced the worst economic crisis with severe fuel shortage affecting its citizens. It was due to this timely assistance and support by India that Sri Lanka could manage the crisis, Mr. Rauff Hakeem said and added that his country would be ever grateful to India. Speaking to journalists at the Tiruchi international airport upon arrival from Colombo, Mr. Rauff Hakeem said Sri Lanka had signed an agreement with India to develop wind power plants in the island nation. Asked for his reaction on Narendra Modi becoming Indias Prime Minister for the third consecutive term, Mr. Rauff Hakeem said he felt that more than who had come to occupy power in India, its democracy had emerged victorious. India being a vast country, elections have been conducted smoothly in multiple phases without any untoward incidents, he said. Although the party of Mr. Modi had formed the government, nevertheless a strong opposition had emerged which augured well for democracy, Mr. Rauff Hakeem said and added that the emphatic victory of the DMK-led alliance headed by Chief Minister M.K. Stalin in Tamil Nadu was indeed an achievement. Source: The Hindu --Agencies",

        "title": "After assassination attempt, Trump and Biden seek calm, unity",
        "date": "July 15, 2024 10:39 am",
        "content": "Donald Trump arrived on Sunday in Milwaukee, where he will be formally nominated as the Republican presidential candidate later this week after surviving an assassination attempt that has aggravated an already bitter U.S. political divide. President Joe Biden, a Democrat, ordered a review of how a 20-year-old man with an AR-15-style rifle got close enough to shoot at Trump from a rooftop on Saturday. Trump, as a former president, has lifetime protection by the U.S. Secret Service. Trump, 78, was holding a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania - a key state in the Nov. 5 election - when shots rang out, hitting his right ear and leaving his face streaked with blood. His campaign said he was doing well. That reality is just setting in, Trump told the Washington Examiner on Sunday. I rarely look away from the crowd. Had I not done that in that moment, well, we would not be talking today, would we? One person in the crowd was killed and two others wounded before Secret Service agents fatally shot the suspect. Both Trump and Biden on Sunday sought calm and unity. Trump is due to accept his partys formal nomination at the Republican National Convention with a speech on Thursday. He pumped his fist in the air several times as he descended the stairs from his plane after arriving in Milwaukee. This is a chance to bring the whole country, even the whole world, together. The speech will be a lot different, a lot different than it wouldve been two days ago, Trump told the Washington Examiner. Biden delivered a televised address from the Oval Office in the White House on Sunday. There is no place in America for this kind of violence, for any violence ever. Period. No exceptions. We cant allow this violence to be normalized, he said. The political rhetoric in this country has gotten very heated. Its time to cool it down. Biden and Trump spoke to each other on Saturday night after the shooting. First Lady Jill Biden also spoke with former First Lady Melania Trump on Sunday afternoon, said a White House official. Trump and Biden are locked in a close election rematch, according to most opinion polls including by ReutersIpsos. The shooting on Saturday whipsawed discussion around the presidential campaign, which had been focused on if Biden, 81, should drop out following a halting June 27 debate performance. The FBI said there were no known threats to the Republican convention - which kicks off on Monday - or anyone attending, while the Secret Service said they do not anticipate any changes to the security plan. The convention will feature televised speeches by rising Republican stars and Trumps choice for a yet-to-be-announced vice presidential running mate, while highlighting the partys stance on such topics as abortion, immigration and the economy. SUSPECT A NURSING HOME AIDE The FBI identified Thomas Matthew Crooks of Bethel Park, Pennsylvania, as the suspect and said the shooting was being investigated as an attempted assassination. FBI officials said on Sunday that the shooter acted alone. The agency said it had yet to identify an ideology linked to the suspect or any indications of mental health issues or found any threatening language on the suspects social media accounts. Crooks was a registered Republican, according to state voter records, and donated 15 to a Democratic political action committee when he was 17. At the time of the shooting he was employed as a dietary aide at a nursing home. The Bethel Park Skilled Nursing and Rehabilitation Center said Crooks performed his job without concern and his background check was clean. The gun - an AR-style-5.56 caliber rifle - had been legally bought, FBI officials said, adding they believed it had been purchased by the suspects father. The officials said a suspicious device was found in the suspects vehicle, which was inspected by bomb technicians and rendered safe. The Secret Service denied accusations by some Trump supporters that it had rejected a campaign request for more security, saying that it recently added protective resources and capabilities to the former Presidents security detail. Hours after the assassination attempt, the Oversight Committee in the Republican-led U.S. House of Representatives summoned Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle to testify at a hearing scheduled for July 22. The shots on Saturday appeared to come from outside the area secured by the Secret Service, the agency said. Butler County Sheriff Michael Slupe said Butler Township police officers had responded to a call about a suspicious person, but were unaware he was armed. He said one officer helped hoist another officer up to look on the roof. As the officer pulled himself up he was confronted by the shooter. The shooter heard him or saw him, he turns around with his rifle and of course the guy just lets go and he falls to the ground, said Slupe. The shooter opened fire shortly afterwards, he said. SPECTATOR KILLED PROTECTING FAMILY The rally attendee killed on Saturday was identified by authorities as Corey Comperatore, 50, of Sarver, Pennsylvania. He died trying to protect his family from the hail of bullets, said Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro. Corey was an avid supporter of the former president, and was so excited to be there, Shapiro said, adding, Political disagreements can never, ever be addressed through violence. Two people wounded in the shooting were in a stable condition on Sunday. Pennsylvania State identified them as David Dutch, 57, of New Kensington, Pennsylvania and James Copenhaver, 74, of Moon Township, Pennsylvania. Residents of Bethel Park, where the suspected shooter lived, expressed shock at the news on Sunday. Its a little crazy to think that somebody that did an assassination attempt is that close, but it just kind of shows the political dynamic that were in right now with the craziness on each side, said resident Wes Morgan, 42, describing Bethel Park as a pretty blue-collar type of area. While mass shootings at schools, nightclubs and other public places are common in the United States, the attack was the first shooting of a U.S. president or major party presidential candidate since the 1981 attempted assassination of Republican President Ronald Reagan. Americans fear rising political violence, ReutersIpsos polling shows, with two out of three respondents to a May survey saying they worried violence could follow the election. After Biden defeated Trump in the 2020 election, Trump supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, in a deadly riot fueled by Trumps false claims that his loss was the result of widespread fraud.

On July 11, 2023, the former President completed paying Rs. 15 million as part of the compensation he was ordered to pay to the victims and filed a motion requesting that he be allowed to pay the remaining sum in 10 installments of Rs. 8.5 million from 30 June 2024 to 20 June 2033. In a motion filed through his lawyers, the former President explained that he receives a pension of Rs. 97,500 as the former President, alongside a sum of Rs. 54,285 for his services as a Member of Parliament, thus, he requested that he be granted the aforementioned time period to pay the remainder of the ordered sum of Rs. 100 million. On 12 January 2023, the Supreme Court found that former President Sirisena, former Defence Secretary Hemasiri Fernando, former Inspector General of Police (IGP) Pujith Jayasundara, former National Intelligence Chief Sisira Mendis and former Chief of State Intelligence Service (SIS) Nilantha Jayawardena have violated the fundamental rights of the people by failing to take action to prevent the Easter Sunday bombings despite receiving sufficient intelligence information. Thus, in its verdict, the Supreme Court bench had ordered Sirisena to pay Rs. 100 million in compensation to the petitioners, while Pujith Jayasundara and Nilantha Jayawardena were each ordered to pay Rs. 75 million, Hemasiri Fernando was ordered to pay Rs. 50 million and Sisira Mendis was ordered to pay Rs. 10 million from their personal money. The relevant order was delivered by a seven-member Supreme Court Judge bench, with regard to 12 petitions filed by various parties stating that their fundamental rights were violated by negligence and failure to prevent the coordinated terrorist attacks on April 21, 2019.",

This verdict was issued when the relevant petition filed by Attorney-at-Law Aruna Laksiri was taken up for cosideration today (15) before a Supreme Court judge bench comprising Chief Justice Jayantha Jayasuriya, Justices Arjuna Obeysekara and Priyantha Fernando. Accordingly, the court ordered the petition dismissed with costs of Rs 500,000 to be paid by the petitioner before July 31, 2024. The petition argued that the 19th Amendment to the Constitution was not properly passed in Parliament and therefore called for a referendum to ensure its proper passage. The Election Commission and its members, the General Secretary of Parliament and the Attorney General had been named as respondents of this petition. The petitioner claimed that through the 19th Amendment to the Constitution, Article 70 of the Constitution has been amended to deprive the President of the power to dissolve an elected Parliament after one year has passed. The petitioner asserted that the amendment has not been approved by a referendum, even though a Supreme Court bench ruled that the amendment should be referred to a referendum. The petitioner pointed out that the amendment cannot be considered as a law because it has not been approved by a referendum and signed by the President. Therefore, the petitioner had argued that it is wrong to continue to accept the 19th Amendment as a law.",

        "date": "July 15, 2024 04:38 pm",
        "content": "Pakistan is planning to ban former Prime Minister Imran Khans political party and move the countrys top court to press treason charges against him, the information minister said on Monday. The move to ban Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) was based on the proven charge of the party receiving foreign funds from sources that are illegal in Pakistan, as well as rioting by the supporters last year that targeted military installations, Minister Attaullah Tarar said. The federal government will move a case to ban the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaaf, he said, adding that the plan will be taken up before the cabinet, which was empowered to take a decision. The government will also file a legal reference against Khan and former President Arif Alvi for treason charges under the countrys constitution before the Supreme Court, Tarar said. Khans aide Zulfikar Bukhari said the decision was a move towards soft martial law. This is a sign of panic as they have realised the courts cant be threatened and put under pressure, he said. PTI candidates contested the Feb. 8 election as independents after it was barred from the polls. The Supreme Court had last week ruled that the party was eligible for more than 20 extra reserved seats in parliament, ramping up pressure on the countrys weak coalition government. It was not immediately clear what impact the planned ban would have on the courts decision to grant reserved seats. Tarar said the government would seek a legal review of the reserved seats issue. He said PTI lobbying in Washington to get the U.S. House of Representatives support for a resolution against Pakistans elections, as well as writing to the IMF to demand an election audit before helping the country were also reasons behind the decision. Jailed since August, Khan was on Saturday acquitted, along with his third wife, on charges that they married unlawfully but he will not be freed after authorities issued new orders to arrest him. Khan came to power in 2018 and was ousted in 2022 after falling out with Pakistans powerful military. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

Londons Metropolitan Police said Yostin Andres Mosquera has been charged with murdering Albert Alfonso, 61, and Paul Longworth, 71. He is due to appear in a London court later Monday. Police said the victims had previously been in a relationship and still lived together, and that the suspect had been staying with them at their west London apartment. Deputy Assistant Commissioner Andy Valentine said the evidence gathered so far does not suggest there was a homophobic motive to the killings. I hope it will be of some reassurance that whilst enquiries are still ongoing and the investigation is at a relatively early stage, we are not currently looking for anyone else in connection with the two murders, Valentine said. The suspect was arrested at a train station in Bristol on Saturday, three days after the grisly discovery of body parts in suitcases on the citys Clifton Suspension Bridge. Police officers arrived at the iconic bridge at around midnight Wednesday, 10 minutes after receiving reports of a man behaving strangely. But the man, who had traveled there by taxi, was already gone. Police found more remains at the victims home in London. Source: AP --Agencies",

        "date": "July 15, 2024 06:11 pm",
        "content": "Bitcoin surged to a two-week high on Monday after the attempted assassination of U.S. presidential candidate Donald Trump raised the odds of the former president, who has presented himself as a champion of cryptocurrency, winning the upcoming election. Trump said he was shot in the ear during the attack at a rally in Pennsylvania on Saturday. His campaign said he was doing well. Some investors said the attack bolstered his chances of winning back the White House and trades betting on his victory are expected to increase this week. Bitcoin rose 8.6 to 62,508, touching a two-week high of 62,698 earlier in the session, taking its year-to-date gains to 47. Ether was also up 6.8 at 3,322. Trump is running against Democratic President Joe Biden in Novembers U.S. election and has slammed Democrats attempts to regulate the crypto sector. Trump presented himself as a champion for cryptocurrency during a San Francisco fundraiser in June, although he hasnt offered specifics on his proposed crypto policy. Hes certainly positioned himself as pro-crypto and as the odds of his reelection were galvanised by the shooting on the weekend, its certainly put a big boost underneath the bid in crypto markets and bitcoin obviously, just an absolute standout, said Tony Sycamore, a market analyst at IG. Trump is due to speak at the Bitcoin 2024 conference in Nashville, Tennessee, on July 27, the organizers of the conference said last week. Bitcoin had a strong start to the year after the launch of exchange-traded funds in the U.S., propelling it to a record 73,803.25 in mid-March but has since struggled. It fell to an over four month low in early July as traders fretted over the likely dumping of tokens from defunct Japanese exchange Mt. Gox. We had four weeks of declines on the back of the Mt. Gox news ... but the rebound, it looks to me like its got further to go and I wouldnt be surprised seeing it head back up towards, at least towards 65,000 by the end of this week, said IGs Sycamore.

        "date": "July 15, 2024 06:21 pm",
        "content": "Shannen Doherty, the Beverly Hills, 90210 star whose life and career were roiled by illness and tabloid stories, has died at 53. After years with breast cancer, Doherty died Saturday, according to a statement from her publicist, Leslie Sloane. The devoted daughter, sister, aunt and friend was surrounded by her loved ones as well as her dog, Bowie. The family asks for their privacy at this time so they can grieve in peace, Sloane said Sunday. The news was first reported by People magazine. Her illness was publicly revealed in a lawsuit filed in 2015 against her former business managers, in which she alleged they mismanaged her money and allowed her health insurance to lapse. She later shared intimate details of her treatment following a single mastectomy. In December 2016, she posted a photo of her first day of radiation, calling the treatment frightening for her. In February 2020, Doherty revealed that the cancer had returned and was at Stage 4. She said she came forward because her health conditions could come out in court. The actor had sued insurance giant State Farm after her California home was damaged in a fire in 2018. I have no idea how long Im going to be on the chemo for. ... Thats not something that I can predict, its not something my doctors can predict. And its scary, its like a big wake-up call, Doherty said on a late June episode of her podcast Lets Be Clear, adding that a recent change in the shape of her cancer cells meant there were new treatment protocols for her to try. For the first time in a couple months probably, I feel hopeful because there are so many more protocols now, whereas before I was hopeful  but I was still getting prepared. A native of Memphis, Tennessee, Doherty moved to Los Angeles with her family at age 7 and, within a few years, became an actor. It was completely my decision, she told The Associated Press in a 1994 interview. My parents never pushed me into anything. They support me. It really wouldnt matter if I was a professional soccer player  theyd still be as supportive and loving. As a child star, she worked steadily in such TV series as Little House on the Prairie, in which she played Jenny Wilder. She detoured as a teenager to the big screen in Girls Just Want to Have Fun (1985) and Heathers. In 1990, the doe-eyed, dark-haired actor won her breakout role as Brenda Walsh in producer Aaron Spellings hit teenage melodrama set in posh Beverly Hills. She and Jason Priestleys Brandon, Brendas twin brother, were fish-out-of-water Midwesterners. But Dohertys fame came with media scrutiny and accounts of outbursts, drinking and impulsiveness  the latter most notably after a very brief marriage to actor George Hamiltons son, Ashley. Dohertys second marriage, in 2002, was to Rick Salomon and was annulled within a year. In 2011, Doherty married photographer Kurt Iswarienko. She filed for divorce in April 2023. She left Beverly Hills, 90210 at the end of its fourth season in 1994 (the show aired until 2000), reportedly removed by Spelling because of conflicts with her co-stars and chronic lateness. But in her 1994 AP interview, Doherty described her life as peaceful. It must be, if you pick up the Enquirer and find the only thing they can write about me is that I installed a pay phone next to my house and was seen at Strouds (a discount bed-and-bath chain) buying 1,400 worth of bed linens and wouldnt go to an expensive store, she said. It must be calm if theyre pulling that stuff out of their heads. Three years later, in 1997, Doherty was sentenced to anger-management counseling by a Beverly Hills Municipal Court judge after she allegedly smashed a beer bottle onto a mans windshield during a quarrel. After a 2001 drunken driving arrest, she pleaded no contest and was ordered to serve five days in a work-release program. Doherty reunited with Spelling when he cast her in 1998 as Prue Halliwell in Charmed. In an AP interview that year, the actor expressed regrets about her past. I did bring a lot of it on myself, Doherty said. I dont think I can point fingers and say, Oh, YOURE to blame. And I dont do that with myself, either. Because I was just growing up. Her personality was grotesquely misconstrued by the media, Doherty added. Spelling said at the time that their relationship was never as bad as some made it seem. We had a few bumps along the road, but golly, who doesnt? said Spelling, who died in 2006. Everything Shannen did was blown out of proportion by the rag sheets. Doherty starred with Holly Marie Combs and Alyssa Milano in Charmed from 1998-2001, at which point her character was replaced by one played by Rose McGowan. Doherty appeared in the 90210 sequel series seven years later and competed on Dancing with the Stars in 2010. She also worked on the third Beverly Hills, 90210 reboot, BH90210, a meta send-up that reunited most of the original cast and aired for one season in 2019. She also appeared in a tribute episode of Riverdale dedicated to that shows star  and her late Beverly Hills, 90210 on-screen love interest  Luke Perry. Doherty struggled to recapture her Beverly Hills, 90210 star status, but worked in big-screen films including Mallrats and Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back and in such TV movies as A Burning Passion: The Margaret Mitchell Story, in which she played the Gone with the Wind author. A nadir was Blindfold: Acts of Obsession, an erotic thriller opposite Judd Nelson. Dohertys lawsuit against her ex-business managers was settled in 2016. She was open about the toll that cancer was taking. She posted photos that showed the baldness that followed treatment and, in an August 2016 interview with Entertainment Tonight, shared her fears. The unknown is always the scariest part, she said. Is the chemo going to work? Is the radiation going to work? she said. Pain is manageable, you know living without a breast is manageable, its the worry of your future and how your future is going to affect the people that you love. Doherty advocated for cancer awareness and care, and spoke to the AP in 2021 about how spending years with the disease affected her life and sense of optimism. When you get something like cancer, your tolerance for drama is zero. I dont like people wasting my time. I dont like negativity, she said. Its odd because I think if you look back, youre like, Oh, gosh, its so much drama around her, but I dont think I was necessarily into the drama. I just think if we took young 18-year-old Shannen, 19-year-old Shannen, and we took her and planted her like right now, I would be a nerd and nobody would be writing about me. Source: AP --Agencies",

        "title": "Gambias parliament upholds ban on female genital mutilation",
        "date": "July 15, 2024 07:13 pm",
        "content": "Lawmakers in the West African nation of Gambia on Monday rejected a bill that would have overturned a ban on female genital cutting. The attempt to become the first country in the world to reverse such a ban had been closely followed by activists abroad. The vote followed months of heated debate in the largely Muslim nation of less than 3 million people. Lawmakers effectively killed the bill by rejecting all its clauses and preventing a final vote. The procedure, also called female genital mutilation, includes the partial or full removal of girls external genitalia, often by traditional community practitioners with tools such as razor blades or at times by health workers. It can cause serious bleeding, death and childbirth complications but remains a widespread practice in parts of Africa. Activists and human rights groups were worried that a reversal of the ban in Gambia would overturn years of work against the centuries-old practice thats often performed on girls younger than 5 and rooted in the concepts of sexual purity and control. Religious conservatives who led the campaign to reverse the ban argued the practice was one of the virtues of Islam. Its such a huge sense of relief, one activist and survivor, Absa Samba, told The Associated Press after the vote. That is a lot of excitement out here. But I believe this is just the beginning of the work. In Gambia, more than half of women and girls ages 15 to 49 have undergone the procedure, according to United Nations estimates. Former leader Yahya Jammeh unexpectedly banned the practice in 2015 without further explanation. But activists say enforcement has been weak and women have continued to be cut, with only two cases prosecuted. Even now, it was widespread and there was public promotion of it, Samba said. She called for more public education about the health consequences of the practice. UNICEF earlier this year said some 30 million women globally have undergone female genital cutting in the past eight years, most of them in Africa but others in Asia and the Middle East. More than 80 countries have laws prohibiting the procedure or allowing it to be prosecuted, according to a World Bank study cited earlier this year by the United Nations Population Fund. They include South Africa, Iran, India and Ethiopia. No religious text promotes or condones female genital mutilation, the UNFPA report said, adding there is no benefit to it. Long term, the practice can lead to urinary tract infections, menstrual problems, pain, decreased sexual satisfaction and childbirth complications as well as depression, low self-esteem and post-traumatic stress disorder.

        "date": "July 15, 2024 10:05 pm",
        "content": "Sri Lanka Tea Board has announced that USD 60 million of the USD 251 million owed by Sri Lanka to Iran for fuel imports since 2011 has been paid through tea exports. This initiative follows a strategic agreement signed between the Sri Lankan and Iranian governments to use tea exports as a method of settling the debt, the Ministry of Agriculture and Plantation Industries said in a statement. The payments arrears for fuel imports were accumulated over several years due to various economic challenges including the COVID-19 pandemics severe impact on the economy, European sanctions imposed since 2011, the collapse of the tourism industry following the Easter attacks, and the overall economic downturn, which led to a shortage of dollars hindering the payment process, the statement added. Sri Lanka Tea Board Chairman Niraj De Mel confirmed that as of July 15, USD 60 million of these due payments have been settled through tea exports. The chairman also highlighted a significant increase in the volume of tea exported to Iran, which has tripled recently, assisting in the settlement of the debt. He further explained that the first five months of 2024 have seen 4.98 million kilograms of tea exported to Iran, compared to 1.85 million kilograms in the same period in 2023. The agreement not only alleviates Sri Lankas financial burden but also strengthens trade ties between the two nations, the ministry highlighted, adding that it exemplifies how creative economic solutions can address financial challenges and enhance bilateral relations.",

        "title": "Trump gets official Republican nomination for president, picks J.D. Vance for running mate",
        "date": "July 16, 2024 07:33 am",
        "content": "Donald Trump chose Ohio U.S. Senator J.D. Vance to be his vice presidential running mate, as the Republican Party officially nominated the former president to run again for the White House today at the start of the partys national convention in Milwaukee. As Vice President, J.D. will continue to fight for our Constitution, stand with our Troops, and will do everything he can to help me MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform. The four-day convention opened in downtown Milwaukees Fiserv Forum two days after Trump narrowly survived an assassination attempt in Pennsylvania, and hours after he secured a major legal victory when a federal judge dismissed one of Trumps criminal prosecutions. Trump is due to formally accept the partys nomination in a prime-time speech on Thursday and will challenge Democratic President Joe Biden in the Nov. 5 election. Vance, 39, was a fierce Trump critic in 2016 but has since become one of the former presidents staunchest defenders, embracing his false claims that the 2020 election was marred by widespread fraud. Soon after Trumps announcement, Vance emerged on the convention floor with his wife Usha, shaking hands with and hugging delegates who swarmed the couple. He smiled widely as he was formally nominated to be vice president and is scheduled to address the convention on Wednesday. Vance is deeply popular with Trumps core supporters, but it remains to be seen whether he can broaden the tickets appeal. He shares Trumps aggressive approach to politics, and his conservative statements on issues such as abortion could turn off moderate voters. Biden told reporters at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland that Vance is a clone of Trump on the issues. Opinion polls show a close race between Trump, 78, and Biden, 81, though Trump leads in several swing states that are likely to decide the election. Trump has not committed to accepting the results of the election if he loses. The head of the main fundraising super PAC supporting Trumps campaign, Taylor Budowich, said on X that MAGA Inc had raised more than 50 million on Monday. After the assassination attempt, Trump said he was revising his acceptance speech to emphasize national unity, rather than highlight his differences with Biden. This is a chance to bring the whole country, even the whole world, together. The speech will be a lot different, a lot different than it wouldve been two days ago, Trump told the Washington Examiner. U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannons decision on Monday to throw out federal charges against Trump for retaining classified documents after leaving the White House was the latest in a string of legal wins for the former president, who is due to be sentenced in New York in September for trying to cover up a hush money payment to porn star Stormy Daniels in the weeks before his 2016 election victory. His other two indictments on federal charges in Washington and state charges in Georgia  both related to his efforts to overturn his 2020 election defeat  are mired in delays and could be significantly limited after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in July that he had immunity for many of his official acts as president. This dismissal of the Lawless Indictment in Florida should be just the first step, followed quickly by the dismissal of ALL the Witch Hunts, Trump said on Truth Social on Monday, also referencing the prosecutions of hundreds of his supporters who stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. NO PLACE FOR VIOLENCE The shooting attempt on Trumps life immediately altered the dynamics of the presidential campaign, which had been focused on whether Biden should drop out due to concerns about his age and acuity following a halting June 27 debate performance. Nearly two dozen of Bidens fellow Democrats in Congress have called on him to end his reelection bid and allow the party to pick another standard bearer. The focus this week will be squarely on Trump. Having consolidated party control, Trump could seize on the opportunity to deliver a unifying message or paint a dark portrait of a nation under siege by a corrupt leftist elite, as he has done at times on the campaign trail. Trump has frequently turned to violent rhetoric in campaign speeches, labeling his perceived enemies as vermin and fascists. Biden has cast Trump as a threat to U.S. democracy, comments that some Republicans say helped foster an atmosphere that prompted the shooting even though authorities have yet to determine the motive for the assassination attempt. The gunman himself was shot dead. Following Saturdays shooting, Biden sought to lower the temperature after months of heated political rhetoric. There is no place in America for this kind of violence, Biden said in an address from the White House on Sunday. In an excerpt of an interview with NBC News set to air later on Monday, Biden said it was a mistake to tell donors last week it was time to put Trump in a bulls eye but noted that Trump has often used incendiary words. Biden ordered an independent review of how the gunman, who killed a spectator, could have come so close to killing Trump. Congressional investigators also sought to question the head of the U.S. Secret Service, which is responsible for protecting the former president. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "title": "During times of need, they chanted slogans without taking responsibility - President",
        "date": "July 16, 2024 08:59 am",
        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe emphasized the importance of a political culture that prioritizes the nation over traditional politics for the countrys advancement. He underscored that all political leaders, both in government and opposition, bear significant responsibility and must support initiatives aimed at improving the national economy. The President also emphasized that the responsibilities of all political leaders, from both the government and the opposition, are crucial and should not be underestimated. He underscored the importance of their unified support for the countrys economic upliftment program, free from political entanglements. President Ranil Wickremesinghe made this statement during a recent meeting at the Presidential Secretariat with a group of lawyers. The President emphasized that everyone has the right to engage in politics, but no one should undermine the economic framework essential for the countrys advancement. He highlighted that recent strikes, including those preceding the upcoming presidential election after the agreement with the International Monetary Fund was signed, were politically motivated. President Ranil Wickremesinghe further commented: The political culture of our country has evolved over the past two years. A coalition was formed with the countrys interests in mind, operating outside the realm of traditional politics. As a result, today we see individuals from various political affiliations, including those independent of any party, participating actively. The events of May 9, 2022, need no further elaboration. Due to widespread oppression, protests erupted among the public. Certain individuals sought to capitalize on these movements. As a result, traditional parties failed to regain leadership of the country. In December 2021, I had a discussion with the Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund, who highlighted a pressing issue in our country and urged me to convey this to the President for prompt action. I subsequently informed the former President about this matter, and it was also discussed during the visit of World Bank representatives. Around the same time, the President convened a meeting with political parties in Parliament to address the issue, during which each party put forward distinct proposals. Only Mr. Sampanthan and Mr. M.A. Sumanthiran from the Tamil National Alliance joined while I was the sole participant from the United National Party. Other opposition parties chose not to join. It must be emphasized that it is an incorrect action. During this period, the country faced a crisis, necessitating collective efforts to determine the necessary measures. No one could evade this responsibility. The leader of the opposition serves as the alternative Prime Minister, not merely a bystander. Therefore, it was their duty to participate. However, none of the political parties took any action in this regard. Following that, on May 09, Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa resigned. At that time, SLPP was unable to maintain government power, and we must acknowledge this. Ministers also resigned. Given the British system, the alternative prime minister could have assumed leadership. Many believed that according to tradition, if Mr. Mahinda Rajapaksa resigned, the leader of the opposition should be given the first opportunity. I expressed willingness to support anyone in this role, but despite being informed to attend on May 10, he did not come forward. They had decided not to accept the post of Prime Minister and did not fulfil their duty, possibly due to focusing on short-term political strategies. During the budget debate, some put forward ideas on how to revive the country, but declined to take on the responsibility themselves. The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna made no effort at all. However, we accepted this responsibility. At the time, the country was declared bankrupt. I was confident that we could recover from this situation. At that moment, it didnt matter who the President was; my priority was saving the country. We have encountered such challenges before. During the 1971 rebellion, Mr. J.R. Jayawardena, then the leader of the opposition, supported Mrs. Sirimavo Bandaranaike. His son was even arrested once, but their stance remained unchanged. In 1989, Mrs. Sirimavo Bandaranaike and Minister Ratwatte approached President Premadasa to pledge their support for restoring law and order in the country. The army commander then asked them to refrain from criticizing their actions once undertaken, to which both agreed. This illustrates our history of discussing and cooperating in different circumstances. When the Indo-Ceylon agreement was signed, Mrs. Sirimavo Bandaranaike and Mr. Dudley Senanayake collaborated despite other times of conflict, which was not seen as problematic. Sri Lanka stands out in Asia for its practice of transferring power based on election results to the winning party. Despite discussions on judicial independence, Sri Lankas judiciary operates uniquely. Issues faced by Indias Supreme Court under Mrs. Indira Gandhi serve as a notable example. While carrying out these duties, we encountered the events of July 9. On that day, the former President vacated the Presidential Palace. Concurrently, I was also asked to resign as Prime Minister. I questioned, to whom I should submit my resignation letter? Should I search the seas to find the President? I stated that if I were to resign, I would need to nominate someone with majority support. The opposition leader says, No, we need to appoint someone therefore you resignation. There, I emphasized that the person present should be given priority. Then they requested the Speaker to take charge. The Speaker responded that while he could manage Parliament, he couldnt take on the responsibility of controlling the economy. This marked a breakdown in the countrys political system. Eventually, there was an attempt to raid the Parliament. When the Army Commander notified that, all the party leaders were inside and they said the Prime Minister should resign. Shortly after, the Army Commander received word that protesters were approaching Parliament. Within five minutes, everyone evacuated the premises. I had to inform the Army Commander to safeguard Parliament and also alerted the Speaker about the situation. During times of need, they chanted slogans without taking responsibility. Despite multiple invitations for discussions, none of them attended. Subsequently, a new political culture emerged in the country. When I assumed the Presidency, I received support from all parties, yet every party also voted against me. A faction, including the Chairman of the SLPP, moved to the opposition, while another group from SJB supported me. Together, we formed a government and I continued working with former ministers without intending to replace any of them, though some departed voluntarily. Politicians from various parties united to work for the nation, receiving support from Members of Parliament regardless of party lines and external sources. Since then, this government has made remarkable strides, achieving success through collaborative efforts regardless of party differences. We have successfully emerged from bankruptcy and are now recognized globally as a country capable of repaying its debts. We are currently implementing agreements with the International Monetary Fund, Official Creditors Committee for Sri Lanka, China Exim Bank, and private creditors. We cannot afford to make different promises; engaging in old politics is no longer an option, and we recognize that. For the country to progress, economic transformation towards a modern export-oriented economy is essential. Our goal is to increase the GDP from USD 85 billion to USD 350 billion by 2048, achievable through diligent efforts. Countries like Singapore and Vietnam have achieved development by maintaining consistency in their policies. In politics, our focus should be on establishing fundamental stability. In Parliament, diverse opinions may arise, but advancing the countrys economic framework is crucial. Many today seek to undermine this framework. Despite recent strikes, coinciding with the upcoming Presidential Election in September and October, there is no need for strikes. If dissatisfied with one party, voters can choose another. Efforts to destabilize the economic framework were opposed by the people. Now, we must affirm the countrys achievements and determine whether to chart a new course or maintain the current system. Its important to acknowledge that your presence here today is a tremendous strength. Lets unite to advance the country. Lets set aside party politics for the next five years. Our country needs a stable economic system. In the first round of the French parliamentary elections, there was an expectation that the extreme liberalised would dominate. However, both the liberalised -wing and lefties decided to unite against the third party in those seats without contesting each other. If the 3rd person is from my Party, my party expels a member, if it is from yours your party should also expel a member. Now, the situation has reversed. Therefore, there are opportunities to collaborate and move forward together. We should strive to create such a scenario in our country. Lets acknowledge the political changes in our country and work together to build our future. We cannot remain a nation reliant on begging indefinitely. Its crucial to uplift the country economically and foster a strong economy. We invite everyone to join hands in fulfilling this responsibility. Thank you for being here today. --PMD--",

        "content": "Buddhasasana, Religious, and Cultural Affairs Minister Vidura Wickramanayake said that many antiquities taken from the country by the United Kingdom during the colonial period, including the statue of Tara, will be returned to Sri Lanka. He said many antiquities taken from the country by the United Kingdom, including the statue of Tara, are in the process of being repatriated. We are working to bring back these and other ancient treasures, and we have also received numerous similar items from the Netherlands, he said. The minister also pointed out that an education system that suits the country and culture should be created in a manner that instills a sense of pride in the minds of the people about their country. Minister of Buddhasasana, Religious, and Cultural Affairs Vidura Wickramanayake expressed these views during a press conference themed Collective Path to a Stable Country held at the Presidential Media Centre yesterday (15th). The minister further elaborated: The majority of the community believes there is an economic problem in the country today. However, our ministry holds the responsibility of shaping the people of Sri Lanka into good citizens. Our ministry has the official mandate to work towards creating a better society. Additionally, the country lacks an education system that aligns with our cultural needs, which has led to a societal crisis. This situation has resulted in the emergence of a group of people who lack love for their country and pride in their heritage, putting the nation at risk of becoming subjugated. Therefore, our ministry has implemented several programs to prevent this outcome and save the people. Additionally, more than a thousand individuals who have served in local government institutions for many years received appointments today. This has been a longstanding need. Some critics claim this is an election tactic, but over ten cabinet papers were presented for their confirmation, indicating that efforts have been underway for more than five months. Furthermore, many antiquities taken from our country by the United Kingdom, including the statue of Tara, are in the process of being repatriated. We are working to bring back these and other ancient treasures, and we have also received numerous similar items from the Netherlands. Moreover, there are people in our country who constantly divide into opposing parties and accuse each other.

        "content": "Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) MP Dr. Rajitha Senaratne says that he is yet to take a final decision as to whether he will support he incumbent President at the upcoming Presidential Election. The former Minister emphasized that he believes the economic programmes being carried out by the President and the government should be continued. Senaratne expressed these views during the Derana 360 programme, aired on TV Derana last night (15). Asked about when he plans on officially declaring his support to President Ranil Wickremesinghe and join him on stage, he responded, I have not taken any such decision. There is no such date to take the stage. I could have gone back then if I wanted to. He clarified that he has not yet had any discussions with the President about extending his support, stating, He hasnt even talked to me about it yet. Now what would have happened to Prabhakaran if he had revised these things without supporting Mahinda Rajapaksa in the same way back then? However, Senaratne said that any potential announcement regarding his support would be carefully timed, saying, If I have an announcement, the time to announce it will also be checked. He further noted his cautious approach by stating, I still havent decided that I will climb on Ranils stage. I have to first check who else is on that stage.",
