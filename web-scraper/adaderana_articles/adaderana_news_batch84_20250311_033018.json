The house is said to be owned by a close associated of an accomplice of the notorious criminal figure Ganemulla Sanjeewa who is in custody under detention orders. A man and a woman were inside the house at the time of the raid, and after going through the womans mobile phone, the PNB officers uncovered traces of online transactions of drug money. Accordingly, the woman, 29, was placed under arrest for onward investigations. The PNB officers said they intend to secure a detention order to further interrogate the arrestee to expose the drug syndicate she was involved with.",

        "date": "January 19, 2024 09:03 pm",
        "content": "The Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) on Friday said its Smart Lander for Investigating the Moon (SLIM) appeared to have landed on the lunar surface. SLIM, also known as the moon sniper, is attempting a highly precise landing  within 100 metres (about 330 feet) of its target compared with a conventional accuracy of several kilometers. The 20-minute descent was set to begin at 1500 GMTUTC on Friday. The powered descent from its 15-kilometer (about 9.3-mile) includes a short phase of ascent before dropping close to the moon. It followed by a fully vertical descent from 7 kilometers. During the descent, the craft scans the potential landing site for rocks and boulders that might jeopardize a smooth touchdown. JAXA says the crafts landing technology could be a powerful tool for the future exploration of hilly poles of the moon. Those areas are potential source of resources necessary to sustain life  oxygen, fuel and water. Achieving a soft landing would make Japan the fifth country to do so, after the United States, the Soviet Union, China, and India. Source: Deutsche Welle (DW) -Agencies",

        "date": "January 19, 2024 10:08 pm",
        "content": "The UN human rights office has urged the Sri Lankan authorities to revise the Anti-Terrorism Bill and to bring it fully into line with the islands international human rights obligations. In a statement published on Friday (Jan.19), the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) raised deep concerns about the proposed Bill, which is currently being considered in the Sri Lankan parliament to replace the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA). Although repeal of the PTA should be a turning point for meaningful reform of Sri Lankas approach to its internal security, the OHCHR said this proposed law instead risks perpetuating patterns of violations from the past. The Anti-Terrorism Bill is substantially identical to its previous drafts that were withdrawn after widespread criticism, the UN human rights office pointed out, noting that it defines acts of terrorism overly broadly, restricts the scope of judicial guarantees, especially with respect to challenging the lawfulness of detention orders, and curtails the ability of the Human Rights Commission to visit places of detention, among other problematic provisions. If passed in its current form, the OHCHR says the Bill would grant excessive powers to the executive to restrict rights, with limited or no safeguard against abuse of such powers. The OHCHR explained that the Bill would weaken the legal grounds needed for security forces to arrest individuals without warrants, while still permitting lengthy pre-trial detention. We urge the authorities to meaningfully engage with civil society and other stakeholders to substantively revise the Bill and bring it fully into line with Sri Lankas international human rights obligations.",

        "title": "All stalled development projects to commence in February - Bandula",
        "date": "January 19, 2024 11:31 pm",
        "content": "Development projects are set to commence in February, following the finalization of agreements related to the debt restructuring and ongoing discussions with foreign creditors of Sri Lanka, according to Dr. Bandula Gunawardena, the Minister of Transport, Highways, and Mass Media. During a media briefing at the Presidential Media Centre on Friday (Jan.19), the minister highlighted that Rs. 150 million has been allocated to the District Development Committees under the relevant chairmen for road development. Additionally, Rs. 50 million has been earmarked through the Ministry of Rural Affairs for the development of small roads. Gunawardena further addressed the financial landscape, emphasizing the need for careful consideration of income and expenditure in the challenging year ahead. In 2022, the governments total tax revenue amounted to Rs. 1,751 billion, with 72 (Rs. 1265 billion) allocated to government employee salaries, pensions, and Rs. 506 billion spent on Samurdhi allowance and support for the less privileged. The minister highlighted the challenge of balancing expenses, including interest payments on loans (Rs. 1,065 billion) and capital expenditure (Rs. 715 billion). He reported the earnings of various government departments, such as the Inland Revenue Department (Rs. 1,550 billion), Customs Department (Rs. 922 billion), Excise Department (Rs. 169 billion), and Motor Vehicle Commissioner Department (Rs. 20 billion). Despite an increase in income from the public and various strategies in 2023 (Rs. 3,201 billion), expenses outpaced revenue, resulting in a deficit. In 2023, the government spent Rs. 2,160 billion on subsidies, Rs. 2,263 billion on interest payments, and a total of Rs. 4,394 billion to run the government, while its income for the year was Rs. 3,201 billion. The government borrowed extensively, with Rs. 10,091 billion borrowed domestically through Treasury Bills and Treasury Bonds. Looking ahead to 2024, development schemes are slated to begin in February after the restructuring of debt and finalizing agreements with creditors. Notably, a USD 60 million loan from the World Bank and financial assistance from the Samurdi Fund will be utilized for road repairs. Despite financial challenges, significant allocations have been made for the Chairmen of District Development Committees, with Rs. 150 million for road development and an additional Rs. 50 million for the development of small roads. The restructuring of foreign debt has reached its final stages, paving the way for the resumption of paused development projects. --PMD",

Acting Inspector-General of Police (IGP) handed over the money to the bereaved at the deceaseds residence in Maharachchimulla, Alawwa. The lorry driver was killed on Thursday night (Jan.18) after a police officer in civvies accidentally discharged his firearm during a vehicle inspection. He was identified as a 41-year-old named Roshan Kumarathilake. He was a carpenter by profession. The police media division said the driver had failed to comply with the signal to stop at a checkpoint in Dampelessa, Narammala. A Sub-Inspector (SI) and a Constable had then chased down the lorry and pulled it over for a spot inspection. There, the SI had allegedly accidentally discharged his firearm, critically wounding the driver, who was rushed to the Narammala District Hospital, but succumbed to injuries shortly after. Meanwhile, a heated situation ensued in front of the Narammala police station following the shooting incident after the enraged family and relatives of the deceased and the area residents staged a protest. The SI in question was subsequently arrested and remanded until January 23 on the orders of Narammala Magistrates Court. Additionally, both officers involved in the incident have been interdicted.",

        "title": "Japan makes history, becoming fifth country to land spacecraft on moon",
        "date": "January 20, 2024 09:43 am",
        "content": "Japan on Saturday became the fifth country to put a spacecraft on the moon, but solar power issues threatened to cut short the nations mission to prove a precision landing technology and revitalise a space programme that has suffered setbacks. The Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) said its Smart Lander for Investigating Moon (SLIM) landed the moons surface at around 12:20 a.m. (1520 GMT Friday), but its solar panels were not able to generate electricity, possibly because they are angled wrong. JAXA prioritised the transfer of SLIMs data to earth as the probe relied only on its battery, which would last for a few hours despite life-sustaining treatments such as turning off its heater, Hitoshi Kuninaka, the head of JAXAs research centre, told a press conference. JAXA will maintain the status quo rather than take risky actions and hopes a shift in the sunlights angle will hit the panels in a way that can restore its functions, he added. It takes 30 days for the solar angle to change on the moon, Kuninaka said. So when the solar direction changes, and the light shines from a different direction, the light could end up hitting the solar cell. Signal from the SLIM was lost, data from NASAs Deep Space Network showed. It was not immediately clear whether the signal loss was temporary or a power-saving measure. Dubbed the moon sniper, SLIM attempted to land within 100 metres (328 feet) of its target, versus the conventional accuracy of several kilometres, a technology JAXA says will become a powerful tool in future exploration of hilly moon poles seen as a potential source of oxygen, fuel and water. Looking at the trace data, SLIM most certainly achieved a landing with 100-metre accuracy, Kuninaka said, although adding it will take about a month to verify it. Japan is increasingly looking to play a bigger role in space, partnering with ally the United States to counter China. Japan is also home to several private-sector space startups and the JAXA aims to send an astronaut to the moon as part of NASAs Artemis program in the next few years. But the Japanese space agency has recently faced multiple setbacks in rocket development, including the launch failure in March of its new flagship rocket H3 that was meant to match cost-competitiveness against commercial rocket providers like SpaceX. The failure caused widespread delays in Japans space missions, including SLIM and a joint lunar exploration with India, which in August made a historic touchdown on the moons south pole with its Chandrayaan-3 probe. JAXA has twice landed on small asteroids, but unlike with an asteroid landing, the moons gravity means the lander cannot pull up for another try, its scientists said. Three lunar missions by Japanese startup ispace, Russias space agency and American company Astrobotic have failed in the past year. In Sagamihara, a Tokyo suburb where JAXAs control centre is located, about 80 people gathered at a city hall for the public viewing of the midnight landing. There has been a series of launch failures (of JAXAs rockets) so I really wanted this to succeed, said Toshie Yamamoto, an office worker in her 50s. There was a tense atmosphere during the descent sequence, but they broke into applause when SLIMs landing on the moon was announced. SOFT LANDING Only four nations - the former Soviet Union, the United States, China and India - and no private company had achieved a soft landing on the moons surface. The 2.4m by 1.7m by 2.7m (7ft x 6ft x 9ft) vehicle includes two main engines and 12 thrusters, surrounded by solar cells, antennas, radar and cameras. Keeping it lightweight was another objective of the project, as Japan aims to carry out more frequent missions in the future by reducing launch costs. SLIM weighed 700 kg (1,540 lb) at launch, less than half of Indias Chandrayaan-3. As the probe descended onto the surface, it was designed to recognise where it was flying by matching its cameras images with existing satellite photos of the moon. This vision-based navigation enables a precise touchdown, JAXA has said. The precision landing wont be a game changer, but the cost-reduction effects of it and the lightweight probe manufacturing might open up moonshots to space organisations worldwide, Bleddyn Bowen, a University of Leicester associate professor specialising in space policy, said ahead of the touchdown. Shock absorbers make contact with the lunar surface in what JAXA calls new two-step landing method - the rear parts touch the ground first, then the entire body gently collapses forward and stabilizes. On landing, SLIM successfully deployed two mini-probes - a hopping vehicle as big as a microwave oven and a baseball-sized wheeled rover - that would have taken pictures of the spacecraft and were slowly sending them to the earth, JAXA said. Tech giant Sony Group (6758.T), opens new tab, toymaker Tomy (7867.T), opens new tab and several Japanese universities jointly developed the robots. SLIM was launched on Japans flagship H-IIA rocket in September and has taken a fuel-efficient four-month journey to the moon. Source: Reuters -Agencies",

CEB trade union members engaged in a series of protests for three days from January 03 - 05, challenging the governments Bill to restructure the Board and the new Electricity Bill. On Friday (Jan.15), the CEB suspended 15 clerical staff members in charge of the cash counters for inconveniencing the customers, who had come to pay their bills, by closing the windows of the counters and refraining from accepting payments. Accordingly, 66 employees in total remain interdicted. The CEB says further inquiries are underway to identify other employees who refrained from performing their duties and disrupted the services amidst the trade union action. Ahead of the trade union action, the CEB management, by way of a circular, had cancelled the leave of all employees with effect from January 02. However, in case of an urgent matter, the employees were allowed to take a leave, with the approval of an executive officer attached to the respective division or branch. Meanwhile, Extraordinary Gazette No.2363.02 published on December 18, 2023, on the instructions of President Ranil Wickremesinghe, had declared all services connected to the electricity supply as essential public services. After the three-day trade union action was launched, Power and Energy Minister Kanchana Wijesekera instructed the CEB management to suspend and take appropriate disciplinary action against the employees disrupting the services, or acting in violation of the guidelines.",

        "date": "January 20, 2024 11:10 am",
        "content": "Epidemiology Unit of the Health Ministry is continuing its MMR (measles-mumps-rubella) Catch-up Immunization Program for children aged between 9 months and 15 years over this weekend. Accordingly, the program is held island-wide on Jan. 20 and 21. The measles vaccination rollout was kicked off after observing a decrease in measles vaccination rates both globally and regionally during the recent COVID-19 pandemic. Epidemiology Unit says this decrease resulted in a significant surge in the incidence of measles cases on both a global and regional level. Adding to this global challenge, Sri Lanka is currently experiencing an imported Measles outbreak since May 2023. A considerable number of cases have been reported to date predominantly among vaccine refusal communities and subsequently spreading to those who were partially vaccinated (between 9 months - 3 years), the Epidemiology Unit emphasized. In response to this situation, a nationwide MMR Catch-up Immunization Program was on January 06, specifically targeting children aged 9 months to 15 years who have missed their due routine MMR vaccinations. Epidemiology Unit noted that children who missed the opportunity to receive the MMR dose during the initial campaign, can receive the catch-up doses at the routine immunization clinic within their respective Medical Officer of Health (MOH) areas. The primary goal of this initiative is to ensure that children aged 9 months to 15 years have the opportunity to receive any missed routine MMR vaccinations. Parents and caregivers are strongly encouraged to bring their eligible children to the nearest immunization clinic to facilitate catch-up vaccination. This collective effort contributes to the overall public health goal of preventing the spread of measles in Sri Lanka, Epidemiology Unit said further. Meanwhile, the MMR Supplementary Immunization Activity (SIA) initiated on January 06 for children aged 6-9 months is also being rolled out further on Saturdays until February 03. The SIA takes place from 9:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. in Colombo (including the CMC area), Gampaha, Kalutara, Galle, Matara, Kandy, Jaffna, Kurunegala and Kalmunai health districts. Children born between April 07, 2023, and July 05, 2023, are eligible to receive the additional vaccination dose.",

        "title": "Surge in measles cases prompts UK to declare national health incident",
        "date": "January 20, 2024 03:25 pm",
        "content": "Further outbreaks of measles could spread across Britain, the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has warned, after declaring a national incident amid a surge in cases and low vaccine uptake. Recent figures from the agency revealed a sharp rise in the number of measles cases, with uptake of the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine at its lowest level in more than a decade and well under the recommended coverage, the UKHSA chief executive, Dame Jenny Harries, has said. This is a call right across the country for all parents to check the vaccination rates of their children, Harries told BBC Radio 4s Today programme as she was due to travel to the West Midlands, which has had the largest recent outbreak of the infection outside London. Data released by the agency earlier this week showed that, since last October, there were 216 lab-confirmed cases in the West Midlands, with 103 cases likely. About 80 of the cases were in Birmingham and 10 were in Coventry, according to the agency, citing low vaccination rates. Most of the cases were among children aged under 10. The average number of children starting school having had both MMR doses has dropped to 85, said Harries, with figures in some areas of the West Midlands down to 81 and just above 70 in the NHS Surrey Heartlands region. Birmingham childrens hospital has treated more than 50 measles cases in the last month, according to the BMJ. We are well under the recommended coverage for MMR vaccination, said Harries. Its clearly not where we want the vaccination programme to be, we want it to be 95. Measles can begin with cold-like symptoms followed by a rash. It can lead to severe illness, with an estimated 20-40 of children hospitalised, according to the UKHSA. The disease was considered eliminated in the UK in 2016 and 2017, meaning transmission had stopped, but resurfaced in 2018. The MMR jab is given to children in two doses: the first when they are one, and a second when they are aged three years and four months. The World Health Organization recommends that at least 95 of children be inoculated for diseases that can be stopped by vaccines. According to the UKHSA, between January and November 2023, there were 209 lab-confirmed cases of measles in England, nearly half of which were in London. The agency said cases were on the rise after outbreaks in the West Midlands, Yorkshire and the Humber. The call for vaccination comes amid concern that the virus is spreading to London, where up to 20 of children are entering school unvaccinated, according to Harries. Thats a significant risk to the London population, she said, while urging young adults to also get vaccinated. In July, the UKHSA carried out a risk assessment and warned the capital of the risk of a major measles outbreak that could result in tens of thousands of cases, dozens of deaths and thousands of hospitalisations. Predictably, were seeing that swing more to other  particularly inner-city  areas where we know vaccination rates are low, and we know large numbers of children will be congregating together, said Davies. London has the lowest percentage of children who have received both doses, according to data from NHS for the year 2022-23, with Hackney in east London at 56.3, followed by Camden in north London at 63.6. In areas such as Camden , mobile vaccination clinics are being offered as more than a quarter of children are starting school without their two MMR vaccinations, said Kirsten Watters, the councils director of health and wellbeing. When talking to parents, we know that most do intend to vaccinate their children and theyve got high levels of confidence and trust, said Watters. Its just that theyre finding it difficult to organise those appointments. One of the reasons for vaccine uptake varying among different communities includes the use of porcine gelatine in an MMR vaccine. Since MMR vaccines are available that do not contain porcine gelatine, Harries said information needs to be made more available and to be given by trusted community leaders. Its clearly important that communities have good information in a way which is meaningful for them, its accessible to them, and that doesnt necessarily mean just a pamphlet or a translation, weve seen that through the pandemic, said Harries. Generally, despite our concerns, the UK population are confident in the vaccine delivery and particularly in the advice they get from primary care and the NHS, she added.

        "date": "January 20, 2024 05:31 pm",
        "content": "Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa has written to Speaker Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena urging the postponement of the upcoming parliamentary debate on the Online Safety Bill. The Second Reading of the Online Safety Bill is scheduled for January 23 and 24, as per a decision taken by the Committee on Parliamentary Business earlier this month. In his letter, Premadasa pointed out that, if passed, the Bill would permit the proposed Online Safety Commission and the minister in charge of the subject to exercise unlimited powers, restricting the peoples right to freedom of speech and expression. In other countries of the world, adequate time and an opportunity to create wide public space are given before bringing forth such Bills, the opposition leader said, alleging that the government has not followed such process when presenting the Online Safety Bill. Instead of protecting the victims of online harassment, this Bill will only serve political interests, Premadasa said further. The Online Safety Bill was published in the government gazette on September 18, 2023, aiming to ban online communication of certain statements in the country, prevent the use of online accounts  both authentic and inauthentic  for the use of prohibited purposes, to suppress the financing and other support of communication of false statements and other related matters. However, the Bill has come under fire for some of its problematic aspects, with the Asia Internet Coalition (AIC) which consists of multiple tech giants including Apple, Facebook, Google, Amazon, and Yahoo, the International Commission of Jurists (ICJ), the Bar Association of Sri Lanka (BASL), Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) and the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka (HRCSL) voicing concerns. A total of 45 petitions had been put forward by Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith, Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB), National Peoples Power (NPP), journalist Tharindu Uduwaragedara and many other parties, alleging that the relevant bill is in violation of the fundamental rights of freedom of speech and expression guaranteed by the Constitution. Later, the Supreme Court, after concluding the deliberation of petitions, communicated its determination on the constitutionality of the Bill and its provisions to President Ranil Wickremesinghe and Speaker Abeywardena, emphasizing that pursuant to Article 84(2) of the Constitution, Clauses 3, 5, 7, 9, 11,12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 36, 37, 42, 45, 53, and 56 should be passed by a special majority in the parliament. However, if these clauses are amended during the Committee Stage, the Online Safety Bill can be passed by a simple majority in the parliament, the Supreme Courts determination read further.",

        "content": "Sri Lanka Navy on Friday (Jan.19) foiled yet another drug smuggling attempt by intercepting a local multiday fishing trawler carrying a large cache of heroin. The street value of the heroin consignment, weighing over 65kg, is believed to be more than Rs. 1,626 million. Additionally, another multiday fishing trawler, suspected of assisting the other vessel, too was impounded during the operation which led to the arrest of 11 suspects involved in the drug smuggling attempt. The Navy and the Police Narcotics Bureau (PNB), in tandem with the intelligence services, had mounted a special operation about 100 nautical miles (approximately 185km) off Dondra Head, Matara on Friday (Jan.19). Accordingly, a suspicious local fishing trawler was first intercepted off the southern coast on Friday morning. The Navy said a subsequent search of the trawler led to the recovery of 3 sacks stuffed with heroin weighing more than 65kg and 076g, intending to be smuggled into the country. Five people who were aboard the drug-carrying vessel were also apprehended. The second multiday fishing trawler, with 6 people aboard, was impounded shortly after. Seized fishing trawlers, 11 suspects and the cache of narcotics were brought ashore to the Galle Harbour on Saturday morning (Jan.20) and were handed over to the custody of the PNB for onward legal action. The suspects, aged between 28 and 52 years, have been identified as residents of Matara, Gandara, and Dondra areas.

Mr. Jaishankar is in the Ugandan capital city of Kampala to represent India at the two-day summit of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM), which began on Friday. Pleased to call on Sri Lankan President RW_UNP on the sidelines of the NAM Summit in Kampala, Mr. Jaishankar posted on X. Appreciate his continued guidance for the advancement of our bilateral initiatives. Indias commitment is reflected in our Neighbourhood First and SAGAR policy, he said. Indias Neighbourhood First policy guides its approach towards the management of relations with countries in its immediate neighbourhood. It is aimed at enhancing physical, digital and people-to-people connectivity across the region, as well as augmenting trade and commerce. Sri Lanka was hit by a catastrophic financial crisis in 2022, the worst since its independence from Britain in 1948, due to a severe paucity of foreign exchange reserves. As the country struggled, locked in the throes of the crisis, India extended multi-pronged assistance of about USD 4 billion to it through multiple credit lines and currency support in line with Indias Neighbourhood First policy. Security and Growth for All in the Region (SAGAR) is Indias policy or doctrine of maritime cooperation in the Indian Ocean region. Earlier in the day, Mr. Jaishankar met his Ugandan counterpart Gen JeJe Odongo. Delighted to begin the day with my dear friend GenJejeOdongo. Thanked him for the excellent arrangements for the NAM Summit. Assured Indias wholehearted support for Ugandas Chairship, Mr. Jaishankar said on X. Noted the progress in our bilateral cooperation since my April 2023 visit. Direct flights, training  exchanges and commencement of the NFSU campus are among notable developments, he added. Mr. Jaishankar on Friday held a series of bilateral meetings with his counterparts from Bahrain, Serbia, Bolivia, Azerbaijan and Venezuela during which he discussed bilateral ties, as well as regional and global issues.

A group of 32 Indian fishermen board for their flight back to India from Colombo, the High Commission of India in Colombo posted on X. The Sri Lankan Navy had arrested 32 Indian fishermen and seized their trawlers for allegedly poaching in the island nations waters in three separate incidents. A total of 18 fishermen were arrested, and their two trawlers were seized on Tuesday off the coast of Mannar in the northeast. On Sunday, as many as ten Indian fishermen were arrested, and their trawler seized for allegedly poaching in the island nations waters, while 12 Indian fishermen were apprehended on Saturday. The fishermen issue is a contentious one in the ties between India and Sri Lanka, with Lankan Navy personnel even firing at Indian fishermen in the Palk Strait and seizing their boats in several alleged incidents of illegally entering Sri Lankan territorial waters. The Palk Strait, a narrow strip of water separating Tamil Nadu from Sri Lanka, is a rich fishing ground for fishermen from both countries. There have been periodic instances of Indian fishermen being arrested by Sri Lankan authorities for allegedly crossing the International Maritime Boundary Line and fishing in Sri Lankan waters. In 2023, the island nations Navy arrested 240 Indian fishermen along with 35 trawlers for allegedly poaching in Sri Lankan waters. --Agencies",

In a joint letter addressed to the Minister, the CPJ, together with 58 other organisations, urged Minister Tiran Alles to withdraw the relevant Bill, and to conduct meaningful consultations with all stakeholders including local groups in this regard. They further raised concerns that the proposed Bill is slated to be presented in Parliament later this month, without addressing the key concerns raised by stakeholders, experts and civil society about the severe implications that the Bill will have on the human rights and democratic values enshrined in the Constitution and international legal instruments to which people in Sri Lanka are entitle. The letter also highlighted that the proposed Bill had a chilling effect on free speech and fails to incorporate the recommendations of experts, while also having a detrimental impact on Sri Lankas digital economy and avenues for employment online. In light of the grave implications for the freedoms of people in Sri Lanka and the opacity of the legislative process thus far, we respectfully call on the government to withdraw the Bill, and to engage in meaningful, sustained and inclusive multi-stakeholder consultations, including civil society and human rights experts, on the way forward for online content regulation.

        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghes recent visit to Uganda has significantly contributed to strengthening diplomatic ties with African nations that have previously been overlooked in Sri Lankas foreign relations. The Minister of Foreign Affairs Ali Sabry PC, highlighted the importance of these engagements, emphasizing the sizable population of approximately 1.3 billion in these African countries and the anticipated rapid development in the future. In his special statement today (20), Minister Ali Sabry pointed out that President Ranil Wickremesinghes Look Africa initiative has laid the groundwork for Sri Lanka to invest in African nations, marking the commencement of a new economic journey for the country. In a special statement on the official visit to Uganda, where President Wickremesinghe participated in the 19th Conference of the Non-Aligned Movement and the G77China Summit, Minister Ali Sabry reiterated the significance of broadening Sri Lankas engagement with Africa. Addressing the Non-Aligned Nations Conference yesterday, President Ranil Wickremesinghe touched upon global issues, particularly focusing on events in the Gaza Strip, Israel-Palestine, the future steps for developing countries, and strategies for alleviating the burden of debt and addressing climate change. The President shared his perspectives on a range of topics. Foreign leaders and ministers I engaged with expressed their commendation for President Ranil Wickremesinghes insightful speech. Simultaneously, the President engaged in discussions with several leaders from the Global South, specifically in the African region. Notable meetings included talks with the President of Uganda, the Prime Minister of Ethiopia, the Vice President of the Republic of Benin, the Prime Minister of the Bahamas, and the Minister of Foreign Affairs of India. The discussions centred on enhancing bilateral relations between these nations and Sri Lanka. I am optimistic that this visit will fortify relations with African countries that are often overlooked, despite their substantial population of 1.3 billion, and are projected to undergo rapid development in the future. The economic progress witnessed in Sri Lanka under President Ranil Wickremesinghes leadership, along with the Presidents pivotal role, garnered appreciation from all counterparts. Reflecting on the past year and a half since President Wickremesinghe assumed office, there has been widespread acclaim for the notable advancements Sri Lanka has achieved. Ugandas President Yoweri Museveni specifically lauded President Ranil Wickremesinghe for contributing to the reconstruction of the nation. Additionally, the Non-Aligned Nations Summits provided a platform to present the current situation in Sri Lanka to the international community. This visit by the President has played a crucial role in fostering bilateral relations with numerous countries in the African region. Furthermore, its noteworthy that President Ranil Wickremesinghes Look Africa initiative has laid the groundwork for investing in African countries, marking the commencement of a new economic chapter for Sri Lanka. A notable example is the arrangement with the Republic of Benin, wherein mutual benefits are expected through the visa exemption for holders of diplomatic, official, and service passports from both countries. As the Foreign Minister, I seized the opportunity to engage in bilateral discussions with counterparts from Bangladesh, Bahrain, Ghana, Tanzania, Azerbaijan, and others.

        "content": "The National Investigation Agency (NIA) of India has filed a supplementary chargesheet against four accused in a 2021 case relating to human trafficking of 39 Sri Lankan nationals into India on the false pretext of taking them to Canada. Mohamed Imran Khan alias Imran, who was arrested by the NIA recently, has been charge-sheeted under various sections of IPC relating to trafficking, confinement, and conspiracy, along with absconders Seeni Aabul Khan, Mohamed Ibrahim alias Ahmed and Pudumadam Imran alias Hajiyar aka Imrankhan, before the NIA Special Court, Bengaluru. The accused were allegedly involved in trafficking of 39 Sri Lankan nationalists to Mangaluru via Tamil Nadu by falsely promising them that they were being taken to Canada. The victims were confined in various lodges across Mangaluru and were initially arrested by Karnataka Police, as accomplices along with the accused persons, NIA said in a press release. NIA had launched investigations after taking over the case on July 13, 2021, and found 39 to be the victims of a human trafficking racket. The agency had filed the original chargesheet in the case on October 5, 2021, against six accused persons who were involved in the trafficking, while the victims were freed and sent back home, NIA claimed. NIA investigations revealed that Mohammed Imran Khan, in conspiracy with Pudhumadam Imran and his friends Seeni Aabul Khan and Mohamed Ibrahim, received the Sri Lankan nationals in mid-sea, and brought them to Bengaluru and further to Mangaluru. NIA said that further investigations showed that the entire initial conspiracy was planned by Pudumadam Imran along with one Eesan, a Sri Lankan national, who is one of the absconding accused in the case. The accused had collected vast sums of money from the victims, and also subsequently from their families. Efforts to arrest the remaining accused persons are continuing, NIA said.

        "date": "January 21, 2024 11:11 am",
        "content": "Heads of states of the Non-Aligned Movement Saturday called Israels military campaign in the Gaza Strip illegal and strongly condemned indiscriminate attacks against Palestinian civilians, civilian infrastructure and the forced displacement of the Palestinian population. While calling for a ceasefire desperately needed for humanitarian aid to access the Gaza Strip, the movement in a joint statement called for a two-state solution, on the basis of the borders before 1967, when Israel seized Gaza, the West Bank and East Jerusalem in a brief war with neighboring Arab states. The group also reiterated support for a Palestinian state to be admitted as a member of the United Nations to take its rightful place among the community of nations. The Non-Aligned Movement, formed during the collapse of the colonial systems and at the height of the Cold War, has played a key part in decolonization processes, according to its website. Member countries aspire not to be formally aligned with or against any major power bloc. Ninety representatives, including 30 heads of state, from the 120 countries that are members of NAM took part in the week-long conference in the Ugandan capital, Kampala. It culminated in a summit of heads of state on Friday and Saturday. Gazas Health Ministry says more than 24,400 Palestinians have died in the current war, and the United Nations says a quarter of the 2.3 million people trapped in Gaza are starving. In Israel, around 1,200 people were killed during the Oct. 7 attack by Hamas that sparked the war and saw some 250 people taken hostage by militants. The NAM statement said members were very concerned at the continued deterioration of the situation on ground and the humanitarian crisis. It condemned Israels continuing settlement construction and expansion activities throughout the Palestinian territories, as well as in Syrias Israeli-occupied Golan Heights. The group called for the attention of the international community, especially the U.N. Security Council. To this end, it is high time to end this abhorrent occupation, which continues to be imposed in flagrant violation of international law, and to ensure the implementation of the countless relevant General Assembly and Security Council resolutions, the statement said. UN Secretary General António Guterres told the summit that the refusal to accept the two-state solution for Israelis and Palestinians, and the denial of the right to statehood for the Palestinian people, were unacceptable. He supported the NAMs position calling for reform of the Security Council. Your Movement has long highlighted the Councils systemic shortcomings and the need for reforms to make it truly effective and representative. How can we accept that the African continent still lacks a single Permanent Member? he asked. Guterres said the killing of 152 UN staff in Gaza is disheartening adding that the Hamas attack on Israel and the destruction of Gaza by the Israel army in 110 days was totally unprecedented during his mandate as UN Secretary General.

The President also emphasized the disproportionate impact on vulnerable G77 economies. In his statement, President Wickremesinghe stressed the urgency of reforming the global financial architecture. The President also pointed out that the contemporary international debt resolution architecture is more suited for a world where the Paris Club and London Club dominated global debt resolution. Currently the global debt and particularly debt in the developing world is dominated by international bond markets, and non-Paris Club lenders, the Presidents Media Division (PMD) reported. The President lamented the diversion of financial resources to debt service, hindering spending on essential public services and human development, impacting Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) targets. He criticized the Common Framework for its inability to provide speedy debt resolution, causing delays in addressing recent sovereign debt distress in many G77 countries. Addressing climate finance, President Wickremesinghe highlighted the failure of the global financial system to meet the Global Souths needs for mitigating and adapting to climate change. Despite commitments made in global forums, he pointed out the lack of real contributions. He introduced Sri Lankas Tropical Belt Initiative, aiming to catalyse private investments for global public goods, including biodiversity, oceans, and forest resources, it added. Expressing concern about rising protectionist tendencies in global trade, the President urged decisions to be made in multilateral forums rather than unilaterally. He emphasized the need for coordination between the G77 and BRICS to ensure the smooth efficiency of global trade and investment. President Wickremesinghe also touched upon the challenges of job creation in developing economies, quoting Joseph Stiglitz on technological changes making manufacturing skills and capital-intensive, resulting in fewer jobs. While advocating for global financial reforms, the President called on the G77  China to formulate strategies for member countries to prepare for energy transition, digital transformation, the green economy, and a skilled workforce for the new global economy. President Wickremesinghe also thanked President Museveni and the Government of Uganda for their hospitality and congratulated President Museveni on hosting the 3rd South Summit and assuming the Chairmanship of the Group of 77  China, the PMD mentioned. The President also expressed gratitude to Cuba for its leadership during the past year and commended their effective leadership in the Havana Declaration. As the G77  China commemorate their 60th year, President Wickremesinghe emphasized the importance of remaining united to overcome multidimensional challenges based on the groups founding principles of unity, complementarity, cooperation and solidarity. As the largest alliance of developing countries within the United Nations, the G77 provided a platform for the Global South countries to express and advance their collective economic interests. It also served as a forum for joint discussions on international economic issues, fostering mutual cooperation among its member countries. The 3rd Southern Summit was convened under the theme of Leaving No One Behind, aiming to enhance collaboration among its 134 member nations in areas such as trade, investment, sustainable development, climate change, poverty alleviation, and the digital economy. The presidency of the G77  China summit, previously held by the Republic of Cuba, was assumed by the Republic of Uganda during this session.",

        "content": "The State Minister of Finance Shehan Semasinghe says that the Micro-Finance and Loan Regulation Act was submitted to Parliament in order to establish a proper, strong regulatory procedure as a government. Joining the FLi Diri Abhimani 2024 awards ceremony, organized to award women entrepreneurs in the Micro-Financial Sector, Semasinghe mentioned that the approval is expected to be obtained for the relevant act within the next few months. We hope to get approval for this act in the next few months and protect consumers so that they can reap micro-finance benefits. We also hope to protect entities which provide these micro-financial benefits, he expressed. The State Minister also said it would take several months for the public to reap the benefits of economic development, adding that Sri Lanka must stick to the existing economic management plan regardless of which government is in power. We hope to establish proper regulation in the country within the first quarter of the year. The economy which remained negative for six quarters is positive from the second quarter of 2023. However, this positive economy is still not allowing the hardships you are facing to recede. Today, the country is under correct economic management and will take some time for benefits to be passed on to all social strata, the State Minister said. Though the economic restructuring process is able to reap benefits of economic development, it will take several months for you to experience these benefits. There is no way to deviate from the correct economic management regardless of the government, he added. Furthermore, Semasinghe stressed that if someone proposes or attempts to deviate from this economic management system, the country will have to face an economic crisis worse than which Sri Lanka had to face in 2022.",

Accordingly, the court granted permission for the suspects to be detained for 07 days by the Police Narcotics Bureau (PNB) for further interrogation. The Sri Lanka Navy seized a local multi-day fishing trawler carrying over 65kg of heroin, and another multi-day fishing trawler suspected of assisting it, during a special operation carried out about 100 nautical miles off the Dondra Head, in southern waters on Saturday (20). The operation also led to the apprehension of 11 suspects in connection to the smuggling racket. The special operation was mounted by the Sri Lanka Navy and Police Narcotics Bureau, together with intelligence services, which led to the recovery of 03 sacks stuffed with heroin weighing more than 65kg and 076g, intending to be smuggled into the country within the apprehended trawler. Meanwhile, the street value of the seized heroin is believed to be more than Rs. 1,626 million.

        "date": "January 22, 2024 07:18 am",
        "content": "More than 25,000 people have now been killed in Gaza since Israels offensive began, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. It said there had been 178 deaths in the last 24 hours, making it one of the deadliest days in the war so far. As fighting continued, Israels Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu again rejected creating a Palestinian state. The White House has said the US and Israel clearly see things differently when it comes to a two-state solution. Israel began its offensive following the 7 October attack in which Hamas fighters killed 1,300 people in southern Israel and took more than 240 hostage. In its first public account of the October assault, published on Sunday, Hamas described it as a necessary step against the Israeli occupation of the Palestinian territories and a way to secure the release of Palestinian prisoners. Israels air and ground operation is currently focusing on southern Gaza, where the military are convinced top Hamas commanders are holed up in, or beneath, the city of Khan Younis. That is where the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it had discovered another tunnel, some 830m (2,700ft) long and containing booby-traps and blast doors. The IDF footage showed what appeared to be a tunnel with mattresses and cells inside - it is where Israel believes around 20 Israeli hostages, including children, were held at various points. None were found when the tunnel was discovered, though. Israeli soldiers have also faced renewed attacks in the north of the Gaza Strip, where Hamas is said to have seized an opening around the town of Jabalia as Israel moved troops and tanks south. More than three months since the conflict erupted, Israel - whose army far outstrips Hamass capabilities - is still facing significant resistance across Gaza. US intelligence agencies reportedly estimate that the Israeli military has killed 20-30 of Hamas fighters, which falls far short of Mr Netanyahus stated aim of completely destroying the armed group. The classified report is also said to have found that Hamas still has enough munitions to continue striking Israel and Israeli forces for months, raising the spectre of a prolonged war in which Israel could get bogged down. The apparent slow progress, the fact no top Hamas commander has yet been captured or killed, and the collective trauma over the 130 or so Israeli hostages still missing, is prompting growing anti-government anger in Israel. Protests are continuing by relatives of those still held by Hamas, calling for Mr Netanyahu to prioritise their release over the potentially impossible aim of destroying Hamas. And a still relatively small anti-war movement is also demonstrating, horrified by the damage wrought on Gaza - one of the most intense and destructive military campaigns in recent history. Most Israelis have rallied around their flag - but not around their prime minister, who, according to a recent poll, only 15 of the public believe should stay in office once the war ends. How it does end is the subject of growing disagreement between Mr Netanyahu and Israels western allies. After speaking to US President Joe Biden for the first time in almost a month, the Israeli prime minister reiterated his rejection of a future Palestinian state. In a post on X - formerly Twitter - he said Israel must retain security control over the entire area west of River Jordan, which also encompasses the Israeli-occupied West Bank territory. Mr Netanyahu has been fiercely opposed to a Palestinian state throughout his political career. But by repeatedly asserting it now, an increasingly unpopular prime minister appears to be doubling down on a view that he feels chimes with the majority opinion in a nation too horrified by the attacks to countenance an independent Palestinian state. His apparent fight for political survival is clashing with exasperated Israeli allies, who hope that the current bloodshed could force both sides into meaningful diplomacy over a sustainable two-state solution. UK Defence Secretary Grant Shapps told the BBC earlier that Mr Netanyahus stance was disappointing. The White House has said the US and Israel clearly see things differently. Antonio Guterres, secretary-general of the United Nations, went further, calling the refusal to accept a Palestinian state completely unacceptable. He added it would indefinitely prolong a conflict that has become a major threat to global peace and security. Source: BBC --Agencies",

        "content": "Forty-seven people were buried when a landslide struck a remote and mountainous part of south-western China on Monday (Jan 22), state media reported. The landslide took place at 5.51am local time in Zhenxiong County, Yunnan province, state news agency Xinhua reported, citing local authorities. State broadcaster CCTV said around 18 households were buried in the landslide, and that more than 200 people were urgently evacuated from the area. Authorities have launched an emergency response involving over 200 rescue workers as well as dozens of fire engines and other equipment, according to CCTV. Footage shared on social media by a local broadcaster showed emergency workers in orange jumpsuits and helmets forming ranks outside a fire station as snowflakes whirled through the air. Other images showed rescuers picking through towering piles of collapsed masonry in which a few personal belongings could be seen. Authorities did not immediately specify whether anyone had died in the landslide. Landslides are common in Yunnan, a far-flung and often impoverished region of China where steep mountain ranges butt against the Himalayan plateau. Mondays disaster occurred in a rural area surrounded by towering peaks dusted with snow, state media footage showed. Temperatures in Zhenxiong hovered at around minus four degrees Celsius on Monday morning, weather data showed. There was no immediate official explanation for what may have caused the landslide. Efforts to establish what happened are underway, Xinhua reported. China has experienced a string of natural disasters in recent months, some following extreme weather events. In September, rainstorms in the southern region of Guangxi triggered a mountain landslide that killed at least seven people, according to media reports. Heavy rains sparked a similar disaster near the northern city of Xian in August, causing the deaths of more than 20 people. And in June, a landslide in southwestern Sichuan province - also remote and mountainous - killed 19 people. Source - AFP - Agencies",

        "date": "January 22, 2024 11:37 am",
        "content": "Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday was set to open a contentious Hindu temple built on the ruins of an ancient mosque in the holy city of Ayodhya. The grand event, which will be attended by thousands, is expected to benefit the Indian leader in the polls just months before a general election. The inauguration of the temple, which is still under construction, is dedicated to Hinduisms most revered deity Lord Ram. It fulfills a demand made by millions of Hindus for over 100 years and delivers on a crucial campaign pledge from Modi and his Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party. Ayodhya, once dotted with tightly packed houses and rundown stalls, has undergone an elaborate makeover in the lead up to the inauguration. Narrow roads have been turned into a four-lane pilgrimage route leading to the temple, tourists are arriving at a new airport and sprawling railway station, and major hotel chains are building new properties. On Monday morning, the mood in the city was jubilant. Devotees from across the country have arrived to celebrate the opening, with groups of them dancing to religious songs that blare from speakers on roads bedecked with flowers. Huge cut-outs of Lord Ram and billboards of Modi are ubiquitous across Ayodhya, where the borders have been sealed to prevent more people from coming in. Some 20,000 security personnel and more than 10,000 CCTV cameras have been deployed. Harish Joshi arrived in Ayodhya from Uttarakhand state four days before the ceremony, hopeful that he may be able to get a glimpse of the ceremony. I am here to see history unfolding before our eyes. For centuries, the story of Lord Ram has resonated in the hearts of millions, he said. The prime minister, alongside several Hindu priests, will attend the consecration ceremony later on Monday, for which a 1.3-meter (4.25-foot) stone sculpture of Lord Ram was installed in the temples inner sanctum. Overall, nearly 7,500 people, including the countrys most elite industrialists, politicians and movie stars, are also expected to attend. Analysts and critics see Mondays ceremony as the start of the election campaign for Modi, an avowed nationalist and one of Indias most consequential leaders who has sought to transform the country from a secular democracy into a distinctly Hindu state in his nearly 10 years in power. The temple, located at one of Indias most vexed religious sites, is expected to embolden Modis chances of clinching a record third successive term by drawing on the religious sentiments of Hindus, who make up 80 of Indias population of 1.4 billion. Built at an estimated cost of 217 million and spread over nearly 3 hectares (7.4 acres), the temple lies atop the debris of a 16th-century mosque. It was razed to the ground in 1992 by Hindu mobs who believed the Babri Mosque was built on temple ruins that marked the birthplace of Lord Ram. The site has long been an intense religious flashpoint for the two communities, with the demolition of the mosque triggering bloody riots across India that killed 2,000 people, mostly Muslims. The dispute ended in 2019 when, in a controversial decision, Indias Supreme Court called the mosques destruction an egregious violation of the law, but granted the site to Hindus while giving Muslims a different plot of land. The fraught history is still an open wound for many Muslims, who see the construction of the temple as a testament to Modis Hindu-first politics. Officials say the temple, a three-story structure etched out of pink sandstone, will open to the public after the ceremony and they expect 100,000 devotees to visit daily. Builders are still working to finish 46 elaborate doors and intricate wall carvings. The inauguration has morphed into a massive national event. Modis government has planned live screenings across the country and even movie theaters in some cities will broadcast the event while offering free popcorn. BJP workers have gone door to door handing out religious flags, while Modi has encouraged people to celebrate by lighting lamps at homes and in local shrines. His government announced a half-day closure on Monday for all its offices, and numerous states have declared it a public holiday. Even the stock and money markets are closed for the day. But not all are rejoicing. Four key Hindu religious authorities have refused to attend, saying consecrating an unfinished temple goes against Hindu scriptures. Some top leaders from Indias main opposition Congress party are also boycotting the event, with many opposition lawmakers accusing Modi of exploiting the temple for political points.

Accordingly, nearly 100 trade unions from across the country are due to participate in the meeting today, which will be held under the leadership of the CEB trade unions. Meanwhile, civil society organisations have planned to launch a protest campaign in front of the CEB Head Office at 12:00 p.m. today, against the said interdiction of employees. On 15 January, the CEB suspended 15 clerical staff members in charge of the cash counters for inconveniencing the customers, who had come to pay their bills, by closing the windows of the counters and refraining from accepting payments. Five days later, on 20 January, 51 more employees of the CEB were interdicted for obstructing the services by refusing to accept bill payments from consumers during their three-day protests staged against the proposed restructuring of the state-owned electricity supplier, thereby bringing the total of interdicted employees to 66. Ahead of the trade union action, the CEB management, by way of a circular, had cancelled the leave of all employees with effect from January 02. However, in case of an urgent matter, the employees were allowed to take a leave, with the approval of an executive officer attached to the respective division or branch. Meanwhile, Extraordinary Gazette No.2363.02 published on December 18, 2023, on the instructions of President Ranil Wickremesinghe, had declared all services connected to the electricity supply as essential public services. After the three-day trade union action was launched, Power and Energy Minister Kanchana Wijesekera instructed the CEB management to suspend and take appropriate disciplinary action against the employees disrupting the services, or acting in violation of the guidelines.",

        "date": "January 22, 2024 12:28 pm",
        "content": "Florida Governor Ron DeSantis ended his fading presidential campaign on Sunday and endorsed Donald Trump just two days before the pivotal New Hampshire primary, leaving former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley as Trumps last long-shot challenger for the Republican nomination. DeSantis decision, less than a week after his deflating loss to Trump in Iowa despite an enormous investment there, caps a stunning fall from grace after DeSantis had been widely seen as Republicans most promising alternative to Trump ahead of the general election in November. His departure sets up the one-on-one battle that Haley has coveted against Trump, the former president who has maintained an iron grip on the Republican electorate despite facing four criminal prosecutions. Trump has pleaded not guilty in all the cases. But DeSantis supporters appear more likely to switch allegiance to Trump than to the more moderate Haley. In New Hampshire, about two-thirds of DeSantis backers cite Trump as their second choice, said Andrew Smith, director of the University of New Hampshire Survey Center. In a video posted on X, DeSantis endorsed Trump while delivering a parting shot at Haley. He has my endorsement because we cant go back to the old Republican guard of yesteryear: a re-packaged form of warmed-over corporatism that Nikki Haley represents, DeSantis said. At a Sunday evening rally in Rochester, New Hampshire, Trump - who spent much of last year attacking DeSantis - praised the governor and said he was looking forward to working together to defeat President Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee. Trump accused Haley of forming an unholy alliance with liberals, never-Trumpers and RINOs, or Republicans in Name Only, to try and win the New Hampshire primary, and repeated a false claim that registered Democrats were allowed to vote in the Republican primary. Trump holds a double-digit lead over Haley in New Hampshire, according to polls, and his campaign hopes a second consecutive win will make his eventual nomination all but inevitable. He also has a commanding lead in South Carolina, which votes on Feb. 24. A Haley loss in her home state - where she served as governor from 2011 to 2017 - would likely doom her campaign. At a campaign event in Seabrook, New Hampshire, Haley drew cheers when she announced that DeSantis had dropped out. For now, Ill leave you with this: May the best woman win, she said. David Kochel, a Republican strategist who has worked on five presidential campaigns, said DeSantis exit was unlikely to change the basic contours of the campaign, given that his support had cratered. The race needs a big dynamic shift, and I dont feel that DeSantis dropping out is that big a deal as he didnt have that much going on in New Hampshire, and he didnt even have that much going on in South Carolina, he said. Another Republican consultant, Ford OConnell, who has ties to both the Trump and DeSantis camps, said he expected most DeSantis voters to come home to Trump. Without question, Trump is the beneficiary of DeSantis ending his campaign, he said. With time running short, Haley has sharpened her attacks on the frontrunner in the final days before the election, blaming Trump for Republican electoral losses in 2020 and 2022 and criticizing his praise for authoritarian leaders. ONCE A CONTENDER Early last year, DeSantis was considered a top presidential contender and a natural heir to Trump due to his combative style and deeply conservative views. He led several head-to-head polls against Trump. But his support had declined for several months, due to a flawed campaign strategy, his seeming lack of ease with voters on the campaign trail and Trumps so far unshakeable command of much of the partys base. More than 70 of Republicans have a favorable opinion of Trump, according to most polls. That forced DeSantis to try and appeal to voters who still admired Trump, as well as those who passionately disliked him. DeSantis failed on both counts. He never successfully articulated to most Trump supporters why he was a better option, while Republicans looking to ditch the former president split their votes among multiple candidates. While many major donors threw their support behind DeSantis early on, they began to rebel as early as the summer. Several DeSantis allies say the governor waited too long to enter the race, which left him open to blistering attacks by Trump, who had announced his campaign more than six months earlier. When DeSantis did formally launch his White House run in May 2023, it was a glitch-filled disaster on Twitter, now known as X, an inauspicious start for a campaign predicated on the governors executive competence. The campaign overhired, burning through cash at a rapid rate, and then outsourced much of the traditional work of a campaign to an outside super PAC, which can accept donations of unlimited size but cannot coordinate with the campaign itself.

        "title": "Modi opens controversial Hindu temple in Ayodhya in grand event ahead of national polls",
        "date": "January 22, 2024 03:00 pm",
        "content": "Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday opened a controversial Hindu temple built on the ruins of a historic mosque in the northern city of Ayodhya, delivering on a crucial Hindu nationalist pledge that his governing party hopes will catapult him to a record third successive term in upcoming elections. The temple, which is still under construction, is dedicated to Hinduisms Lord Ram and fulfills a long-standing demand by millions of Hindus who worship the revered deity. Modis party and other Hindu nationalist groups who seized on the demand have portrayed the temple as central to their vision of reclaiming Hindu pride, which they say was shadowed by centuries of Mughal rule and British colonialism. Modi, dressed in a traditional kurta tunic, led the opening ceremony as Hindu priests chanted hymns inside the temples inner sanctum, where a 1.3-meter (4.3-foot) stone sculpture of Lord Ram was installed last week. A conch was blown by a priest to mark the temples opening and Modi placed a lotus flower in front of the black stone idol, decked in intricate gold ornaments and holding a golden bow and arrow. He later prostrated before the idol. Millions of Indians watched the ceremony on television, with news channels running non-stop coverage of the event, portrayed as a religious spectacle. Ram Rajya (rule) begins, a TV news headline said. Ram Rajya is a Sankrit phrase that means just and ethical governance in Hinduism, but has also been used by Hindu nationalists to signify Hindu domination in an officially secular India. Nearly 7,500 people, including elite industrialists, politicians and movie stars, witnessed the ritual on a giant screen outside the temple as a military helicopter showered flower petals. Modi has been the face of an unprecedented and unapologetic fusion of religion and politics in India. Ahead of the temple opening, he set the tone by visiting numerous Ram temples over 11 days as part of a Hindu ritual. Analysts and critics see Mondays ceremony as the start of the election campaign for Modi, an avowed Hindu nationalist and one of Indias most consequential leaders who has sought to transform the country from a secular democracy into a distinctly Hindu state in his nearly 10 years in power. They say the pomp-filled display led by the government shows the extent to which the line between religion and state has eroded under Modi. Prime ministers prior to Modi have also been to temples, been to other places of worship, but they went there as devotees. This is the first time that he went there as somebody who performed the ritual, said Nilanjan Mukhopadhyay, an expert in Hindu nationalism and author of a book on Modi. The temple, located at one of Indias most vexed religious sites, is expected to embolden Modis chances of clinching a record third successive term by drawing on the religious sentiments of Hindus, who make up 80 of Indias population of 1.4 billion. Ayodhya, once crowded with tightly packed houses and rundown stalls, has undergone an elaborate makeover in the lead up to the temples 0inauguration. Narrow roads have been turned into a four-lane pilgrimage route leading to the temple, tourists are arriving at a new airport and sprawling railway station, and major hotel chains are building new properties. Jubilant devotees from across the country have arrived to celebrate the opening, with groups of them dancing to religious songs that blare from speakers on roads bedecked with flowers. Huge cut-outs of Lord Ram and billboards of Modi are ubiquitous across Ayodhya, where the borders have been sealed to prevent more people from coming in. Some 20,000 security personnel and more than 10,000 security cameras have been deployed. The moment will be remembered as momentous and historic by many of the countrys Hindu citizens. I am here to see history unfolding before our eyes. For centuries, the story of Lord Ram has resonated in the hearts of millions, said Harish Joshi who arrived in Ayodhya from Uttarakhand state four days before the ceremony. Built at an estimated cost of 217 million and spread over nearly 3 hectares (7.4 acres), the temple lies atop the debris of the 16th-century Babri Mosque, which was razed to the ground in 1992 by Hindu mobs who believed it was built on temple ruins marking the birthplace of Lord Ram. The site has long been a religious flashpoint for the two communities, with the demolition of the mosque triggering bloody riots across India that killed 2,000 people, mostly Muslims. The dispute ended in 2019 when, in a controversial decision, Indias Supreme Court called the mosques destruction an egregious violation of the law but granted the site to Hindus while giving Muslims a different plot of land. The fraught history is still an open wound for many Muslims, who see the construction of the temple as a testament to Modis Hindu-first politics. Officials say the temple, a three-story structure made of pink sandstone, will open to the public after the ceremony and they expect 100,000 devotees to visit daily. Builders are still working to finish 46 elaborate doors and intricate wall carvings. The inauguration has morphed into a massive national event. Modis government planned live screenings across the country and even movie theaters in some cities showed the event while offering free popcorn. Governing party workers have gone door to door handing out religious flags, while Modi encouraged people to celebrate by lighting lamps at homes and in local shrines. Government offices were closed for half a day on Monday, and many states declared it a public holiday. Even the stock and money markets were closed for the day. But not all are rejoicing. Four key Hindu religious authorities refused to attend, saying consecrating an unfinished temple goes against Hindu scriptures. Some top leaders from Indias main opposition Congress party are also boycotting the event, with many opposition lawmakers accusing Modi of exploiting the temple for political points.

        "date": "January 22, 2024 04:36 pm",
        "content": "Sri Lankan all-rounder and Womens Team Captain Chamari Athapaththu has been named in the ICC Womens T20I Team of the Year for 2023, and has been honoured with the team captaincy. The ICC Team of the Year recognises 11 outstanding individuals who have impressed throughout 2023, be it with the bat, the ball or their all-round exploits. The ICC Womens T20I Team of the Year for 2023 is as follows: Chamari Athapaththu (c) (Sri Lanka) The veteran Sri Lankan started the year with a Player of the Match performance in Cape Town in the ICC Womens T20 World Cup, smashing 68 off 50 balls to help Sri Lanka beat South Africa by three runs. The big upset win set the tone for a remarkable year for Sri Lanka women and Athapaththu was at the forefront of it all. She finished with 470 runs in the year, scoring at a quicker-than-usual strike-rate of 130.91. With 15 sixes in the year, she also hit a personal high in Womens T20Is. In the second half of the year, Athapaththu hit a purple patch, recording an unbeaten 80 in 47 balls in Colombo to help Sri Lanka pull back a win in the three-match series against New Zealand. Athapaththus assault blew the White Ferns attack away as Sri Lanka went on to chase 141 with all 10 wickets to spare. She then went on to play a pivotal role in Sri Lankas series triumph over England in England. Beth Mooney (wk) (Australia) Making 410 runs at an average of 41 and a strike rate of 120.58, Beth Mooney was a key performer for the all-conquering Australians who claimed another T20 World Cup trophy. Mooney began her year with 46 (29) against Pakistan in Hobart, and despite a slow start in the successful campaign in South Africa, flourished when her side needed it most. The left-hander made 56 (53) to kick into gear, before a crucial half-century against India in the semi-final at Newlands. Mooney would go on to make 74 (53) in the final against the tournament hosts at the same venue. From there, attention turned to a Womens Ashes and a home series against the West Indies. Mooney made scores of 61, 22, and 32 against England on the away trip. Laura Wolvaardt (South Africa) Only Hayley Matthews made more runs than Laura Wolvaardts 586 runs at 45, and the South African star enjoyed the stage of a home T20 World Cup. The classy right-hander built into the year with a knock of 42 (39) against the West Indies in East London, and pushed on with three consecutive fifties as the Proteas made their World Cup charge. Wolvaardt continued in the same vein when travelling to Pakistan, making 44, 41, and 72 in Karachi, before returning to South Africa and making 53 (44) against New Zealand in Benoni. Wolvaardts last outing was an unbeaten 49 against Bangladesh in Kimberley. Hayley Matthews (West Indies) A unanimous selection in the Team of the Year, Matthews was the most-prolific run scorer in womens T20Is (700 at 63.63, strike rate 132) in 2023, while also claiming 19 wickets at an economy of 6.84. The No.1 ranked MRF Tyres ICC Womens T20I all-rounder put on a remarkable performance for the ages against Australia in a bilateral T20I series in the second half of the year. Her stellar showing in the series saw her make scores of 99, 132, and 79 as the West Indies skipper proved to be a thorn in the Australian side. Matthews extraordinary unbeaten 99 in the first game of the series was overshadowed by her own mind-blowing 132 in a run-chase of 213 in Sydney. The world-record run-chase in womens T20Is saw Matthews break several records including the highest individual score in a womens T20I run-chase. Her overall tally of 310 runs in the series is the most by any player in a womens T20I bilateral series. Matthews also had a good T20 World Cup, making 130 runs and taking four wickets and four catches. Overall, the all-rounder racked up 700 runs in the year, the most by any player in a year in Womens T20Is. She also picked up 19 wickets at an average of 16.21 in the year. Nat Sciver-Brunt (England) Making 364 runs at 45.50 and a strike rate close to 136, Nat Sciver-Brunt continued to match her reputation as one of the best players in the world, only dismissed twice under 10 across the year in the T20I format. Sciver-Brunt reached 40 in four or five knocks at the T20 World Cup in South Africa, making 50 (42) against India in Gqeberha and 81 (40) against Pakistan in Cape Town. The right-hander made 40 (34) in the semi-final against South Africa, and went on to make another half-century (77 from 53 balls) against India at the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai. Sciver-Brunt chimed in with the ball at times, taking five wickets at an economy of better than eight an over. Amelia Kerr (New Zealand) It was another strong year for one of the games brightest talents, making 365 runs with bat in hand alongside 12 wickets in 11 bowling efforts with her leg-spin. With the bat, Kerr averaged close to 37 with a strike rate of 115.50, making three half-centuries over the year. Her knock of 66 from 48 balls against Sri Lanka was a highlight for the White Ferns at the T20 World Cup, also hitting 70 (46) in bilateral action against the Proteas later in the year. A spell of 323 against Australia in Paarl was a highlight on the bowling side, also taking 311 against Pakistan in Queenstown at the end of the year. Ellyse Perry (Australia) Despite a lean run at the start of the year, Perry ended 2023 on a high, putting together scores of 51, 34, 70 and 40 in the bilaterals against England and West Indies. A notable aspect of Perrys year was her continued aggressive intent with the bat as she made 319 runs in 10 innings at an average of 45.57 and a strike-rate of 151.18. With 11 sixes in the year, she surpassed her personal best and showcased a different range to her T20 game. While her batting stood out in a year where she had little to do with the ball, a standout highlight was a remarkable piece of fielding in the T20 World Cup semi-final game against India. With 18 needed off 9 balls, Perry stopped a boundary in stunning fashion, throwing herself into the air and flicking the ball back to save two runs. Ash Gardner (Australia) Player of the Tournament of the T20 World Cup in 2023, Gardner provided both highlight moments and a dependable consistency as Australia powered to more silverware. Gardner made 234 runs at 29.25 with a strike rate of 121.24 across the year, of which 110 were made at the T20 World Cup. Often trusted to accelerate in tough middle order positions, her 31 (18) and 29 (21) in the knockout stages were crucial. It wasnt just Gardners wicket-taking abilities that were noticed at the T20 World Cup even with the five-wicket haul against New Zealand being a highlight, but her ability to tie oppositions down in clutch situations. Her 120 in the T20 World Cup final stifling the South Africans in Cape Town helped the favourites overpower the hosts, and Gardner finished the year with 17 wickets at 19.70 with an economy of 7.33. Gardner finished the year with a spell of 332 (3.5) against the West Indies in Brisbane to solidify her credentials as a no-doubt selection. Deepti Sharma (India) Deepti Sharma proved difficult to get away for almost every opponent in 2023, going at less than a run a ball across almost 60 overs for India. The off-spinner claimed 21 wickets in 17 outings, including four three-wicket hauls early in the year. The last of the three came at the T20 World Cup in Cape Town, finishing with 315 in four overs against the West Indies, as the spinner helped her country reach the knockout stages of the tournament. The lower-order batter also chipped in with the bat when required, making 106 runs at a rate of better than a run a ball. Sophie Ecclestone (England) The top-ranked womens T20I bowler finished the Womens T20 World Cup with 11 wickets, more than anyone at the tournament. Ecclestones sensational showing in the tournament saw her go past 800 rating points, becoming just the second bowler to do so in the MRF Tyres ICC Womens T20I Bowling rankings. She played a starring role in the T20 World Cup campaign for England, even putting in a brilliant showing in the semi-final, where her 322 wasnt quite enough for England to beat South Africa. She finished the year with 23 wickets in 11 matches, with an amazing average of 10.60 and bowled at an economy rate of 5.65. Ecclestone ends the year as the No.1 ranked Womens T20I bowler with 777 rating points. She ended the year on a high, returning to the side after a surgery to her dislocated right shoulder, and finishing the T20Is against India as the joint-highest wicket-taker. Megan Schutt (Australia) So crucial with the new ball, Megan Schutt again stepped up for Australia when needed, taking 21 wickets at 15.57 at a rate of just 6.81 runs per over. Schutt claimed 515 (4) against Pakistan to begin the year, and raced into the T20 World Cup with seven wickets in the first three matches of the campaign. The swing bowler went on to claim a wicket in every match at the tournament, taking 123 in the final against South Africa. Source - ICC - Agencies",

        "content": "The Ceylon Electricity Board Engineers Union (CEBEU) has accused Sri Lankas Power and Energy Minister Kanchana Wijesekera of attempting to generate public anger towards CEB and its staff, as part of what they claim is his ongoing efforts to harass CEB staff to position himself as a hero in the eyes of the public. Responding to a recent claim made by the Minister on X (formerly Twitter), alleging that the CEB had provided financial facilities to the tune of Rs. 12 billion to it employees, the CEB Engineers Union highlighted that CEB staff, like other employees in both public and private sector institutions, including LECO and PUCSL, do enjoy benefits beyond their basic salary. Accusing the Minister of carrying out a mud-slinging campaign, CEB condemned Minister Wijesekeras for treating CEB employees like criminals. Responding further to Minister Wijesekeras claims that two-thirds of the employees loan interests are paid by CEB, the trade union claimed that the relevant approach is similar to other institutions directly providing concessional loans to staff using their own funds. The scheme of reimbursing only two-thirds of the interest has been considered more beneficial to CEB than giving the entire loan using its funds, as it allows the organization to save funds for other essential development purposes, the statement further read in this regard. On 20 January, Minister Wijesekera revealed that two-thirds of the employees loan interest paid by the CEB is recovered from consumer tariffs, and that financial facilities amounting to Rs. 12 billion are granted to the employees.

In a statement issued on Monday (22 Jan.), the BASL called on the relevant authorities to conduct an independent inquiry into the matter. The BASL urged for the said investigation, recalling the recent death of a lorry driver in the Damepelessa area in Narammala, after a Police Sub-Inspectors firearm had allegedly accidentally discharged during a vehicle inspection, after the lorry driver had failed to comply with a police checkpoint. Further, the BASL also highlighted that the Minister of Public Security Tiran Alles has expressed determination to persist with the ongoing anti-crime operations despite the escalating criticism regarding their execution. While acknowledging the necessity of law enforcement action against individuals engaged in drug-related activities, the BASL urged that such operations be conducted in manner strictly adherent to legal protocols. With regards to the Ministers statements suggesting that certain Non-Government Organisations (NGOs) and lawyers had corresponded with overseas entities and triggered subsequent public statements, the BASL accused the Minister of making statements that are irresponsible, misleading and detrimental to the crucial role lawyers play in serving public interest. The justice system provides a vital check and balance and should not be attacked for the sake of political point-scoring, the statement reads.

        "date": "January 22, 2024 09:03 pm",
        "content": "UN experts on Monday expressed alarm at the heavy security-driven approach of Sri Lankas drug response. They called on authorities to immediately suspend and review so-called Operation Yukthiya and to focus on policies based on health and human rights. Drug users have human rights, the experts said. They deserve to live a life with dignity without facing further discrimination and stigmatisation. They deplored reported cases of arbitrary arrests of thousands of drug offenders from marginalised socio-economic groups, and the detention of hundreds in compulsory military-run rehabilitation centres. Torture and ill-treatment were also reported during the security operation known as Yukthiya. The current context of severe repression against suspected drug offenders is deeply worrying, the experts said. They stressed that rehabilitation must be conducted from a harm reduction perspective, respecting the autonomy and informed consent of drug users, including the right to refuse medication. Compulsory rehabilitation centres should be closed immediately and replaced by voluntary, evidence-based, rights-based and community-based social services, said the experts, who stand ready to provide technical cooperation. They urged Sri Lankan authorities to investigate thoroughly and impartially any allegations of torture, ill-treatment and denial of due process and fair trial rights. Irregularities in the judicial process of sending people to rehabilitations centres should also be investigated, the experts said. They called on the Government to review its current legislation on drug offences and to end the involvement of armed forces in drug control and treatment activities, in line with international human rights law and standards. The experts raised concerns about Sri Lankas legislation on the treatment of suspected drug offenders in a letter sent to the Government in 2023. The UN experts include Priya Gopalan (Chair-Rapporteur), Matthew Gillett (Vice-Chair on Communications), Miriam Estrada-Castillo, and Mumba Malila, Working Group on arbitrary detention; Margaret Satterthwaite, Special Rapporteur on the Independence of Judges and Lawyers and Tlaleng Mofokeng, Special Rapporteur on the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health.",

        "date": "January 22, 2024 09:33 pm",
        "content": "Health Minister Dr. Ramesh Pathirana announced a staggering 91 vaccination rate for measles among children, a crucial step in combating a recent resurgence of the disease after eradication. This achievement demonstrates the countrys dedication to proactive healthcare, he said. Speaking at a media briefing on Monday, Dr. Pathirana outlined further health priorities for 2024. Disease prevention takes centre stage, with plans to bolster primary healthcare services and improve efficiency for patients. Prompt access to essential resources is also a key focus, he stressed. However, tackling non-communicable diseases (NCDs) remains a major challenge. Over 20 of Sri Lankans battle diabetes, and the country holds the dubious distinction of having the highest prevalence of high blood pressure among over-35s in South Asia. Addressing these concerns and their associated complications like heart disease and stroke is critical for Sri Lankas long-term health, the minister said. Amidst a rapidly aging population, Sri Lanka is proactively addressing the rise of non-communicable diseases like memory impairment, eye diseases, and bone diseases through dedicated programs. Dengue fever, another pressing concern, is being tackled with special efforts, seeking increased public collaboration alongside support from health and security departments, he emphasized. Combatting the rapid spread of dengue fever is a top priority, and were calling for all hands on deck! While were working closely with health and security departments, public cooperation is crucial to curbing this outbreak, the minister said. Following a concerning rise in measles cases in Sri Lanka, we launched targeted programs and successfully vaccinated 91 of children in a matter of weeks, effectively shielding them from this preventable disease. Recognizing the existing drug shortage, the government is actively importing essential medicines, with shortages gradually decreasing. Imagine a medical supply system free from opaqueness; were working with the IT Departments of Moratuwa and Colombo Universities to develop an online platform that will bring transparency and efficiency to the entire supply and procurement process, Minister Pathirana added. -PMD-",

Issuing a statement, the Secretary General emphasized that when such incidents related to disciplinary violations in the Parliament are reported, investigations related to them are carried out very impartially under the guidance of the Speaker and the Speaker did not interfere or influence in any way other than giving his assistance at best towards holding speedy investigations. The Secretary General stated that although an incident was reported in which sexual harassment of several female employees was reported, the internal committee appointed in this regard conducted a very impartial investigation and the investigation report has now been handed over to her. Furthermore, she pointed out that the chief officer who is suspected to be involved has been suspended from work and thus the related steps will be taken immediately. The Secretary General also said that further investigations have been conducted in this regard and has been handed over to the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) for law enforcement. The Secretary General further stated that the reports stating that the Leader of the Opposition was notified via a letter regarding such harassment but no proper action was taken are also completely false and the Office of the Leader of the Opposition has confirmed that such a letter has not been received by the Leader of the Opposition thus far. The Secretary General also points out that she is the head of the Parliament Secretariat and that she is a woman, and that the opportunity for women to head many departments in the Parliament has been created because there is an environment and culture in the Parliament where women can perform their duties without any undue influence or violence. In such a situation, the Secretary General further states that she is extremely disappointed regarding the publication of completely false, fabricated and baseless information to damage the reputation of the Parliament of Sri Lanka and the Speaker and condemns such publications with contempt, the statement said.",

Local authorities dispatched a team to reach the quakes epicentre, the Xinhua state news agency said, while some 800 people were on stand-by ready for any large disaster relief mission. The quake was registered just after 2:00 am at a depth of 13km in Chinas Xinjiang region, some 140km west of the city of Aksu. Two residential houses and livestock sheds collapsed in the area near the epicentre, in rural Wushi County, Xinhua reported, while electricity was temporarily knocked out. Local TV channels in the Indian capital New Delhi reported strong tremors in the city, about 1,400km away. One Aksu resident told Xinhua that people rushed outside for safety amid the shaking, despite the frigid early morning temperatures hovering around -10C. Mr Cao Yanglong, in the city on a business trip, told the state news agency that while on the 21st floor of a hotel, he felt like he was going to be shaken out of bed. People also fled their homes to seek refuge in the street in Kyrgyzstans capital Bishkek, according to an AFP reporter, after the quake caused walls to shake and furniture to shift. Mr Bohobek Azhikeev, head of the Kyrgyz Ministry for Emergency Situations, said in a video message that no casualties or damage have been registered in the city of Bishkek. AFTERSHOCKS Five villages are located within 20km of the epicentre, according to Xinhua, and a slew of small earthquakes followed in the area, with magnitudes as high as 5.5. Extensive damage is probable, the United States Geological Survey report on the earthquake said. Authorities in Kazakhstan also reported tremors, though without any casualties or major destruction confirmed so far. In Almaty, Kazakhstans largest city, citizens streamed outside following the quake, according to images posted on social media and by local news outlets. Tuesdays earthquake came the day after a landslide buried dozens of people and killed at least eight in the southwest of China. A December quake in the northwest of the country killed 148 people and displaced thousands in Gansu province. That quake was Chinas deadliest since 2014, when more than 600 people were killed in southwestern Yunnan province. In the December earthquake, subzero temperatures made the aid operation launched in response even more challenging, with survivors huddled around outdoor fires to keep warm. Source: AFP --Agencies",

The Board arrived at this decision at its meeting held on 22 January following a comprehensive assessment of domestic and international macroeconomic developments in order to maintain inflation at the targeted level of 5 per cent over the medium term, while enabling the economy to reach its potential, a statement said. The Board took note of the effects of the recent developments in taxation and supply-side factors that are likely to pose upside pressures on inflation in the near term. However, the Board viewed that the impact of these developments would not materially change the medium-term inflation outlook, the central bank said. Further, the Board noted the space created by past monetary policy easing measures and the decline in the risk premia attached to government securities for further downward adjustment in market lending interest rates. The Board underscored that the envisaged benefit of further reduction in market lending interest rates needs to be adequately and swiftly passed on to the businesses and individuals by financial institutions, it further said.",

The bill was approved when the Sectoral Oversight Committee met in Parliament yesterday (22) under the chairmanship of the Member of Parliament Lalith Warankumara. Thus, the bill will be taken for the second reading debate, today (23). Officials representing the Ministry of Public Security, the Attorney Generals Department, the Legal Draftsmans Department, Sri Lanka Police and the National Secretariat of Non-Governmental Organizations joined yestedays meeting.

Members of Parliament Gayantha Karunathileka, Iran Wickramaratne and Chandima Weerakkodi pointed out to the committee that further time is required to make amendments to the draft bill and that there should be policy amendments in this regard. They pointed out that it is important to get more time without passing this bill quickly in the parliament. Accordingly, the chairman of the committee mentioned that the parliament will be informed about the matter presented by these members. The Online Safety Bill, published in the government gazette on September 18, aims to ban online communication of certain statements in the country, prevent the use of online accounts  both authentic and inauthentic  for the use of prohibited purposes, to suppress the financing and other support of communication of false statements and other related matters. However, the Bill has come under fire for some of its problematic aspects, with the Asia Internet Coalition (AIC) which consists of multiple tech giants including Apple, Facebook, Google, Amazon, and Yahoo, the International Commission of Jurists (ICJ), the Bar Association of Sri Lanka (BASL), and the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka (HRCSL) voicing concerns. A total of 45 petitions had been put forward by Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith, Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB), National Peoples Power (NPP), journalist Tharindu Uduwaragedara and many other parties, alleging that the relevant bill is in violation of the fundamental rights of freedom of speech and expression guaranteed by the Constitution. Later, the Supreme Court, after concluding the deliberation of petitions, communicated its determination on the constitutionality of the Bill and its provisions to President Ranil Wickremesinghe and Speaker of Parliament, emphasizing that pursuant to Article 84(2) of the Constitution, Clauses 3, 5, 7, 9, 11,12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 36, 37, 42, 45, 53, and 56 should be passed by a special majority in the parliament. However, if these clauses are amended during the Committee Stage, the Online Safety Bill can be passed by a simple majority in the parliament, the Supreme Courts determination further stated.",

The Government of Sri Lanka has so far been issuing a travel document called Refugee Repatriation Passport for this segment of Sri Lankans for the purpose of only returning to Sri Lanka considering their irregular stay in India. The Sri Lanka Deputy High Commission in Chennai made a proposal to the Government of Sri Lanka taking into account the volume of requests received from these Sri Lankans to issue all country passport enabling them to travel to other countries for higher education, employment opportunities and family reunification etc., the Deputy High Commission said in a statement. Consequently, under the directives of President Ranil Wickremesinghe, a Committee headed by the Secretary to the Prime Minister was formed including key stakeholders such as the Department of Immigration and Emigration, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Defence, Ministry of Public Security and Ministry of Justice to carry out this project. So far, over 3500 applicants have shown interest to apply for the passports under this scheme and 900 applicants have already applied for passports. Significance of this initiative is that for the first time, the Government of Sri Lanka under this initiative has considered issuing passports to the children born in India to Sri Lankan parents if they have met the necessary requirements, the statement revealed. Addressing the gathering, Minister of Minorities Welfare and Non-Resident Tamils Welfare of the Government of Tamil Nadu Gingee K.S Masthan, High Commissioner of Sri Lanka to India Kshenuka Senewiratne, and Governor of the Eastern Province Senthil Thondaman underscored the significance of this historic milestone.

Delivering his speech, Deputy High Commissioner of Sri Lanka to Southern India Dr. D. Venkateshwaran expressed his gratitude to all stakeholders who worked tirelessly to make this initiative a great success. 92,000 Sri Lankans who have come to India are currently being accommodated in Tamil Nadu by the Government of India.

        "title": "Cameroon starts world-first malaria mass vaccine rollout",
        "date": "January 23, 2024 11:32 am",
        "content": "The worlds first routine vaccine programme against malaria has started in Cameroon, in a move projected to save thousands of childrens lives across Africa. The symbolic first jab was given to a baby girl named Daniella at a health facility near Yaoundé on Monday. Every year 600,000 people die of malaria in Africa, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). Children under five make up at least 80 of those deaths. Cameroon is offering the RTS,S vaccine free of charge to all infants up to the age of six months old. Patients require a total of four doses. Health officials say these will be given at the same time as other routine childhood vaccines to make it easier for parents. It comes after successful pilot campaigns in Kenya, Ghana and Malawi - where the vaccine caused a 13 drop in malaria deaths in children of eligible age, says Unicef. The jab is known to be effective in at least 36 of cases, according to US researchers, meaning it could save over one in three lives. While the rollout is undoubtedly a relief and a life-saver, its relatively low efficacy rate means that it is not a silver bullet, argues Willis Akhwale at End Malaria Council Kenya. But for medics it is an important additional tool in the fight against malaria alongside mosquito nets and malaria tablets. Using all three together potentially gives children 90 protection from malaria, one UK-led study estimates. We have a capacity to considerably reduce the number of cases and deaths from malaria and accelerate the elimination of the disease, Cameroonian doctor Shalom Ndoula, who helped to lead the vaccine rollout in his country, told BBC Newsday. Development of the RTS,S vaccine has taken 30 years of research by the British drug-maker GSK. The World Health Organization, which approved the vaccine, hailed the launch in Cameroon as a historic moment in the global fight against the mosquito-borne disease. There was another breakthrough earlier this month, when Cape Verde became the first sub-Saharan African country in 50 years to be officially declared malaria-free by the global health body. Safe, effective and free Fears and doubts among some Cameroonians about the safety and efficacy of the doses have raised concerns about vaccine hesitancy. When people say we are being used as guinea pigs, thats not particularly true, Wilfred Fon Mbacham, who is a Cameroonian king and also a professor of public health biotechnology specialising in malaria, told BBC Newsday. We as scientists have to do much more to educate the public on what it is, and the benefits it has, so that we can calm their fears. Vaccination official Daniele Ekoto at Mondays launch told the BBC she was reassuring mothers after administering doses to their children, insisting that its a vaccine thats safe, effective and free. But for others the benefits are obvious. I decided to vaccinate my child to avoid malaria. Its a bad thing and when it affects a child, they can easily die, one mother told the BBC at the same vaccination centre in Soa, near Yaoundé, where Mondays launch happened. In 2021, Africa accounted for 95 of malaria cases globally and about 96 of related deaths. I have prayed and waited all my life for this vaccine, Mr Mbacham told the BBC. The WHO says Cameroon records about six million malaria cases every year, with 4,000 deaths in health facilities - most of them children below five. Six-month-old children in 42 districts with the greatest rates of morbidity and mortality will receive four doses until the age of two. Twenty other countries aim to roll out the programme this year, according to the global vaccine alliance, Gavi. Among them are Burkina Faso, Liberia, Niger and Sierra Leone. There is already a big demand for doses, but only about 18 million are available for allocation before 2025, according to Gavi. It falls short of what is needed by the countries the vaccine alliance has recommended for approval. The anticipated rollout of a second jab - R21 - developed by Oxford University, is expected to significantly increase the number of doses available for use. This is to be manufactured by the Serum Institute of India, which aims to make 100 million doses per year, so long as it successfully passes the regulatory approvals following its recommendation for use by the WHO last year.

        "date": "January 23, 2024 12:14 pm",
        "content": "A man suspected of shooting and killing eight people in suburban Chicago fatally shot himself after a confrontation with law enforcement officials in Texas, police said late Monday. Police in Joliet, Illinois, said on Facebook that at about 8:30 p.m. Central time 23-year-old Romeo Nance was located by U.S. Marshals near Natalia, Texas, and that Nance shot himself after a confrontation. The Medina County Sheriffs Office in Texas said on Facebook that the agency received a call about a person suspected in the Chicago killings heading into the county on Interstate 35. A standoff then occurred between Nance and police from multiple agencies at a gas station, where Nance shot himself, the sheriffs office said. Nance is suspected of fatally shooting eight people at three locations in the Chicago suburbs, sparking a search that left neighbors on edge earlier Monday as police warned he was still on the loose and should be considered armed and dangerous. Police in Will County in Illinois and Joliet previously said they did not know of a motive for the killings, but said Nance knew the victims. The FBIs fugitive task force had been assisting local police in the search for the suspect, Joliet Police Chief William Evans said. The victims were found Sunday and Monday at three separate residences, authorities told reporters at a news conference earlier Monday evening. One of the people killed was found Sunday in a home in Will County. Seven others were found Monday at two homes on the same block in Joliet, located about about 6 miles (9.6 kilometers) northwest of the scene police discovered first. Authorities said they also believe Nance was connected to another shooting in Joliet that wounded a man on Sunday but would not discuss their evidence. Ive been a policeman 29 years and this is probably the worst crime scene Ive ever been associated with, Evans said during a news conference outside the Joliet homes Monday evening. Will County Chief Deputy Dan Jungles said during the Monday news conference that deputies had been staking out one of the houses since Sunday evening in case Nance, the suspect in the first fatal shooting they discovered, returned to them. Nances last known address was one of the homes, police said. When no one showed, deputies finally went to the door of one of the houses. No one answered so they crossed the street to the other house, which they knew was linked to the first house and found the first bodies. Five bodies were found in one house and two bodies were found in the other. Jungles said he didnt have any indication yet of how long the people in the houses had been dead. He said that autopsies were pending. Evans said the victims found Monday in the houses were family members. Asked if the victims were members of the suspects family, Jungles said he couldnt comment except to say that the suspect knew them. Teresa Smart lives about a block away from where seven of the victims were found and had said she was worried she and her family wouldnt be able to sleep Monday night. This is way too close to home, she said, adding that police cars had been blocking streets throughout the neighborhood. I keep looking out the window and double checking my doors, she said. Its super scary. Joliet Police said in a Facebook post earlier on Monday afternoon that they were investigating multiple people found dead and shared Nances photo and images of a vehicle. Authorities identified the vehicle as a red Toyota Camry. Earlier Monday, the Will County Sheriffs Office shared images of the same car via Facebook and said it had been seen at the scenes of two separate shootings Sunday afternoon.
