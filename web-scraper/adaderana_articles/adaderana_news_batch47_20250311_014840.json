        "date": "August 22, 2023 04:47 pm",
        "content": "WhatsApp is already one of the best messaging apps, but theres always room for improvement. Thats why were getting new updates that bring important new features almost every month. Recently, the app added support for high-resolution photos and promised to bring support for HD videos very soon too. On top of that, weve just learned that WhatsApp is working on additional text formatting tools that will make communications easier and even more fun. The fine folks over at WabetaInfo spotted a brand-new feature in the latest beta version of WhatsApp, which indicated that Metas developers have started to implement new text formatting tools. Currently, theres proof about three new text formatting options, which will be added on top of the already available italics, bold, strikethrough, and monospace options. The first one is called Code Block and is aimed at software developers and programmers who might want to send code snippets to their friends or colleagues. This particular text formatting tool will prevent the confusion created when code snippets were not being displayed accurately in the chat window. Another interesting text formatting tool, Quote, will receive a small yet important improvement. WhatsApp plans to introduce a new option that will allow users to highlight portions of a text that they want to quote. Currently, you can only quote entire messages, not parts of them. Last but not least, one of the latest beta versions of WhatsApp had a new formatting tool that allowed users to create lists of items. That will basically eliminate the need to manually add bullet points to every item that you want to be included in your list. The report mentions that these features are now in development, so it may take some time until WhatsApp actually releases them for everyone to use. Still, its nice to know what well be getting in future updates, even if these new features wont be available for a long time. Source  Phone Arena --Agencies",

        "content": "Finance State Minister Ranjith Siyambalapitiya has promised to intervene to provide expeditious solutions for the issues pertaining to opening letters of credit (LCs) for importing public transport buses and special-purpose heavy vehicles. On August 15, the Sri Lankan government issued a Gazette Extraordinary relaxing the restrictions imposed on importing public transport buses and other special purpose vehicles such as fire trucks and garbage trucks. The order was made effective from August 14. Further, the government also decided to release heavy vehicles imported during the restricted period and still remain uncleared at ports. During a meeting with the state minister, the Vehicle Importers Association of Sri Lanka (VIASL) pointed out that the letters of credit issued by Sri Lankan banks are not internationally accepted due to the countrys economic situation. Despite the government easing restrictions on the importation of public transport buses and other special-purpose vehicles, VIASL members said they are facing issues at the moment due to LCs. To this, Siyambalapitiya responded that the government is ready to work on resolving the issue concerning the letters of credit, promising to discuss the matter with the Central Bank officials and respective authorities. The state minister further mentioned that he is looking into the possibility of issuing government guarantees for relevant letters of credit.",

        "date": "August 22, 2023 09:36 pm",
        "content": "China has requested permission for a research ship to dock in Sri Lanka, Colombo said Tuesday, following a visit by a spacecraft-tracking vessel last year that sparked security concerns from neighbouring India. Sri Lankan foreign ministry spokeswoman Priyanga Wickramasinghe said Beijing had sought permission for the Shi Yan 6 to dock, but that no date had been set and the request was being processed. Chinese state broadcaster CGTN calls the Shi Yan 6 a scientific research vessel crewed by 60 that carries out oceanography, marine geology and marine ecology tests. Last year, India raised concerns over a Sri Lanka port call in Hambantota by Chinese research vessel Yuan Wang 5, which specialises in spacecraft tracking and which New Delhi described as a spy ship. India is suspicious of Chinas increasing presence in the Indian Ocean and its influence in Sri Lanka, seeing both as firmly within its sphere of influence. Sri Lanka is strategically placed halfway along key east-west international shipping routes. Last year, Colombo attempted to address New Delhis concerns by asking China not to engage in any research activities while in Sri Lankan waters. The Hambantota port has been run by the Chinese since 2017, when they took on a 99-year lease for 1.12 billion, less than the 1.4 billion Sri Lanka paid a Chinese firm to build it. China last year said it was completely unjustified for certain countries to cite security concerns to pressure Sri Lanka. China owns 52 percent of cash-strapped Sri Lankas bilateral debt, and Beijings support is crucial for Colombos efforts to restructure its foreign loans. Colombo defaulted on its 46 billion external debt in April 2022, and must restructure its finances as part of an International Monetary Fund bailout. Source: AFP -Agencies",

        "date": "August 23, 2023 06:13 am",
        "content": "All eight people who were stuck in a cable car dangling hundreds of metres above a ravine in Pakistans north-west for many hours have now been rescued. In a slow and dangerous operation, a military helicopter rescued one child, while teams on the ground recovered the rest of the group after dark. They were helped to safety along a zip line, with a huge crowd on top of the hillside celebrating their rescue. The group were on their way to school when one of the cars cables snapped. It was left hanging precariously across 274m (900ft) above the ground and in high winds. Pakistans caretaker prime minister, Anwaar ul Haq Kakar, said he was relieved, and thanked all of those who were involved in the rescue. Pakistans army said the rescue mission had been extremely difficult and dangerous. The incident happened at about 07:00 local time (02:00 GMT) on Tuesday near the city of Battagram in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. Six children, aged between 10 and 16 years old, were trapped, along with two adults. One of the children, a teenage boy, has a heart condition and was unconscious for several hours, an adult on board named Gulfaraz told local media. A child also fainted due to heat and fear, a rescue worker told Reuters news agency, although it was unclear if that was the same child. Known by locals as Dolly, the cable car links the village of Jangri to Batangi, where the school is located. The car is a popular and cheap mode of transport to get across the Allai valley - cutting a two-hour road journey through mountainous terrain to just four minutes. When the cable suddenly snapped, Dolly was making its fifth trip of the day. Residents used loudspeakers to alert officials to the crisis, but it took at least four hours for the first rescue helicopter to arrive at the remote location, local media outlet Dawn reported. Anxious crowds, including relatives of those trapped, quickly gathered along the ravine, watching on as military helicopters battled against the strong winds to lower commandos to the stranded car. Several early attempts to reach them failed, however some food and water was successfully delivered. In addition to gusty winds, there were concerns that the helicopters rotor blades could further destabilise the cable car, and as night set in the operation was suspended. But rescuers continued their efforts with the help of zip line experts and local people on the ground. Allai is a mountainous area, located at an altitude of 2000m above sea level. Settlements are spread far and wide and there is little infrastructure like roads and basic facilities. In most of the area, makeshift chairlifts and cable cars are used regularly for transportation from one mountain to another. The one involved in this incident is believed to be privately operated by residents, local media reported. Police said they checked the lift every month, however BBC News has been unable to independently verify this. Anwaar ul Haq Kakar says he has ordered all privately-operated lifts to be inspected for safety. Source: BBC -Agencies",

        "content": "Sri Lanka has generated an income of USD 315 million from gems and jewellery exports in the months that have elapsed this year, says State Minister for Primary Industries Chamara Sampath Dasanayake. In the previous year, we achieved a significant income of USD 230 million through gem exports. Notably, in the year (2023), our gem and jewellery exports have yielded substantial revenue of USD 315 million. Addressing a media briefing at the Presidential Media Centre on Tuesday (Aug. 22), the state minister highlighted that the gems and jewellery sector has demonstrated an impressive export growth rate of 34, a fact he said corroborated by reports from the Central Bank. Noting that the Gem  Jewellery Authority is a pivotal contributor to the nations foreign exchange reserves, Dasanayake also spoke of the numerous strategic decisions undertaken to boost the authoritys profits. He said a novel customs clearance system was devised under the aegis of the new government, adding that each exported gem is meticulously assessed to ensure the inflow of foreign exchange. According to him, the Central Banks reports confirm a remarkable 34 growth in export revenue for the Gems and Jewellery Authority. Dasanayake mentioned that last year, the authoritys revenue from licensing and assessment fees amounted to a modest Rs. 144 million. However, this year alone, the authority has recorded a substantial profit of Rs. 288 million. Consequently, we have devised strategies to enhance the authoritys profits by a remarkable 200 by year-end. Speaking further, he went on note that the employees of the authority are not reliant on government salaries. The Gems and Jewellery Authority, independently, contributes between Rs. 50 and 100 million to the Ministry of Finance, underscoring our commitment to the nations economic well-being.",

A scene of chaos then ensued regardless of the Deputy Speaker repeatedly asking the MPs to act accordingly. As his requests fell on deaf ears, the Deputy Speaker, adjourning the parliamentary sitting for 10 minutes, also ordered MPs Wasantha Yapa Bandara and Nalin Bandara to be removed from the Chamber for the remainder of todays sitting due to their unruly behavior which disrupted the orderly conduct of parliamentary proceedings.

        "content": "India will make its second attempt to land on the moon on Wednesday, a mission seen as crucial to lunar exploration and the countrys standing as a space power, just days after a similar Russian lander crashed. The Indian Space Research Organisations (ISRO) Chandrayaan-3 spacecraft will attempt to land on the lunar south pole about 6:04 p.m. local time (12:34 p.m. GMT) on Wednesday, less than a week after Russias Luna-25 mission failed. Indias mission - Chandrayaan means moon vehicle in Hindi and Sanskrit - is its second attempt to land there. In 2019, ISROs Chandrayaan-2 mission successfully deployed an orbiter but its lander crashed. Landing on the south pole (of the moon) would actually allow India to explore if there is water ice on the moon. And this is very important for cumulative data and science on the geology of the moon, said Carla Filotico, a partner and managing director at consultancy SpaceTec Partners. Anticipation and excitement for the landing was feverish Wednesday, with banner headlines across newspapers, and news channels running countdown timers to the landing. Prayers were held in temples, mosques and churches in the country, and schoolchildren waved the Indian tricolour as they waited for live-screenings of the landing. Prime Minister Narendra Modi will watch the landing from South Africa, where he is attending the ongoing BRICS summit, media reported. Rough terrain makes a south pole landing difficult, and a first landing would be historic. The regions water ice could supply fuel, oxygen and drinking water for future missions. For India, a successful moon landing would mark its emergence as a space power as Prime Minister Narendra Modis government looks to spur investment in private space launches and related satellite-based businesses.

        "date": "August 23, 2023 03:28 pm",
        "content": "According to the proposal of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), if the government removes the SVAT facility, an efficient mechanism should be implemented for refunding the VAT, all the Associations of Export Industries informed the Sectoral Oversight Committee on Alleviating the Impact of the Economic Crisis. The committee met on Monday (21)under the chairmanship of Member of Parliament Gamini Valeboda and representatives of all major Exporters Associations including the United Garment Manufacturers Association, the Rubber Products Exporters Association, the Tea Products Exporters Association and the officials of the Ministry of Finance, Department of Inland Revenue were present and there was a lengthy discussion regarding the governments decision to remove the SVAT facility, the Parliamentary Communications Department said in a statement. Finance Ministry officials pointed out that the government expects to take this decision to implement a successful tax system like the tax system in developed countries. But the exporters associations pointed out that even if there is no opposition regarding the removal of the SVAT facility, a proper mechanism must first be established in this country as in the developed countries. It was also discussed that due to the long time taken for VAT refundsrepayments, it directly affects the cash flow of exporters and even after 7 years of RAMIS system was established in 2016 and spent billions, it is a problem that an efficient system for tax collection and refunds has not yet been established, the statement mentioned. According to the Act, although taxes should be reimbursed within 45 days, it was discussed that taking a long time is a problem. Accordingly, corrupt situations have arisen to the extent that certain third-party groups, including officials, act as brokers for quick reimbursement of tax money. It was also revealed that according to the cabinet decision related to removing the SVAT facility, if this facility is removed, a proper system should be established first, according to the Parliamentary Communications Department. Although the officials of the Inland Revenue Department have said that the government is losing revenue through the SVAT system, the committee pointed out that the problem is that they do not present sufficient figures to confirm it correctly. Therefore, the committee chairman, informed that a report on this matter should be submitted to the committee within a week. Also, he instructed the department to present clearly what is the alternative program for VAT reimbursement if this SVAT facility is removed, it added. He also informed the export industrialists to submit a comprehensive report with all the quantitative data to the committee within a week. The chairman of the committee emphasized that protecting the export industries, which play a huge role in the economy of the country, is a national responsibility and that the Sectoral Oversight Committees will constantly advocate for it. He further said that according to all these facts, recommendations are expected to be submitted to the government through the Parliament, it said.",

        "date": "August 23, 2023 05:28 pm",
        "content": "A pastor has been caught smuggling 600 kg ganja worth around 10 million Indian rupees from Andhra Pradesh to the coastal area of Tamil Nadu. Initial investigation revealed that he was trying to smuggle it to Sri Lanka, Indian media reported today. The smuggling attempt was thwarted by a special team of the Prohibition wing of the Tamil Nadu police who were on patrol near Kayathar, Thoothukudi. They spotted a mini container lorry with a Chennai registration number and stopped it for enquiry on suspicion. As the driver gave unconvincing answers, cops inspected the container which turned out to be empty. However, the top portion of the container looked odd with fresh white paint which prompted cops to inspect it. It turned out that smugglers designed the container with a secret space at the top portion to hide drugs. Cops recovered 300 packets of ganja each weighing 2kg from the secret compartment. The driver and 2 others travelling with him were arrested and taken to the Prohibition Wing police station for investigation. Initial investigation revealed that one of the arrested was a pastor named John Arputha Bharat, a native of Arogyapuram in Thoothukudi. The other two are driver Shakti Babu of Enam and Vijayakumar of Thoothukudi. The three brought the package from Andhra Pradesh and were trying to smuggle it to Sri Lanka. An ABP Nadu report says that they chose the coastal area of TN along the Thoothukudi, Vembar, and Tharuvaikulam route to avoid being intercepted by police and easily access the sea. Police estimate the value of the 600 kg package from INR 6 million to 10 million. Smuggling activities are on the rise as efforts to revive the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) are speculated to have picked up again, the report said. Early this month, TN police busted another smuggling ring and seized 300 kg of ganja from the coasts of Nagapattinam. A few days later NIA raided many places involved in an illegal drugs and arms trade racket in Chennai and arrested a man. TN police have been receiving intelligence inputs about such attempts from central agencies which have been tracking Pakistani and Tamil nationalist groups behind this. Police officers say that these networks smuggle ganja to Sri Lanka and bring back heroin which is used to raise funds to revive LTTE. Other than being ferried to Sri Lanka, drug smuggling and peddling has also resulted in the deterioration of law and order situation in Tamil Nadu. Crimes induced by drug abuse have become rampant in TN with the free flow of ganja and other drugs in recent times, the report added. Source: Hindu Post --Agencies",

        "date": "August 23, 2023 06:14 pm",
        "content": "A progress review meeting on climate change initiatives was held at the Presidential Secretariat this morning (23), underscoring Sri Lankas commitment to climate action and international collaboration, the Presidents Media Division (PMD) reported. The meeting, presided over by President Ranil Wickremesinghe, brought together key advisors and experts to discuss strategies to strengthen the nations response to climate change. Addressing the meeting, President Wickremesinghe stressed the importance of resilience on both local and global fronts. We must be formidable in our actions, both domestically and internationally, he declared, noting the critical role finance plays in supporting climate initiatives. He said that finance is the lifeblood of any endeavour, and the country needs to build substantial strength in this arena, the PMD said in a statement. The Presidents call for action was backed by his observation that while numerous climate change initiatives are proposed, limited attention is given to the vital matter of financing. He said Sri Lankas expertise in international economics, especially in climate financing linked to debt management, positions Sri Lanka uniquely. President Wickremesinghe also proposed the establishment of a National Consultative Committee with the involvement of private and public sector agencies. There will be a national consultative committee that includes every agency involved in the public or private sector. This committee may consist of about 100 to 150 members. However, this committee should be the one consulted at least once every six months to discuss the progress being made. If you can establish a structure like this, it could be the desired outcome. I believe that all of you, especially foreign ministries, will need to collaborate with the environment ministry regarding international aspects. Additionally, I think we all need to contribute, including a focus on international finance. We could align this with our Institute of Economics and Trade, positioning Sri Lanka as a hub for global financial activities. Therefore, we will work on this to consolidate the concept. The President also highlighted alignment with international agendas, including those of the UN Secretary General and President Biden. He proposed the establishment of an International Climate Change University as a global research hub and a testament to Sri Lankas dedication. Ruwan Wijewardane, Senior Advisor to the President on Climate Change, informed the President about discussions with prominent universities, including those in the US and Cambridge, regarding the establishment of the Climate Change University, the statement added. Key highlights for the upcoming COP28 were also revealed during the meeting, encompassing the Climate Justice Forum, International Climate Change University, Climate Prosperity Plan launch, and the Tropical Red initiative. The importance of showcasing Sri Lankas best practices through a pavilion and hosting discussions was also emphasized. Advisor to the President on Environment, Climate, and Green Finance, Mr. Ananda Mallawatantri, presented a comprehensive proposal for collaborations with international universities, highlighting Georgetowns agreement for collaboration and opportunities with Yale. He also detailed plans for collaborations with institutions in the EU, aiming to exchange expertise and promote sustainable practices, it said. In the realm of green finance, the President Appointed Green Financing Committee has been working on a roadmap for Sustainable Finance, with support from UN Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP), UNDP, and the Global Green Growth Institute (GGGI). The committee is actively engaging in initiatives like Debt for Nature Swaps and presenting a project on the Kelani River Basin. The meetings outcomes echoed President Wickremesinghes vision of a sustainable future, marked by international collaboration, cutting-edge research, and strategic climate action. The commitment to environmental preservation alongside economic progress underpins Sri Lankas endeavours as it steps onto the global stage in addressing climate change. The meeting was attended by Minister of Environment Naseer Ahamed, Ruwan Wijewardane, Senior Advisor to the President on Climate Change, Presidents Senior Economic Adviser Dr. R.H.S. Samaratunga, Secretary to the Ministry of Finance K M Mahinda Siriwardana, Secretary to the Ministry of Environment Dr. Anil Jasinghe and other officials, according to the PMD.",

        "date": "August 23, 2023 06:35 pm",
        "content": "An Indian spacecraft landed on the moon on Wednesday in a mission seen as crucial to lunar exploration and Indias standing as a space power, just days after a similar Russian lander crashed. This is a victory cry of a new India, said Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who was seen waving the Indian flag as he watched the landing from South Africa, where he is attending the BRICS summit. Scientists and officials clapped, cheered and hugged each other as the spacecraft landed and as the government now looks to spur investment in private space launches and related satellite-based businesses. India is on the moon, said S. Somanath, chief of the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) as the Chandrayaan-3 spacecraft landed on the lunar south pole. This was Indias second attempt to land a spacecraft on the moon and comes less than a week after Russias Luna-25 mission failed. People across the country were glued to television screens and said prayers as the spacecraft approached the surface. Chandrayaan means moon vehicle in Hindi and Sanskrit. In 2019, ISROs Chandrayaan-2 mission successfully deployed an orbiter but its lander crashed. The Chandrayaan-3 is expected to remain functional for two weeks, running a series of experiments including a spectrometer analysis of the mineral composition of the lunar surface. Rough terrain makes a south pole landing difficult, and a first landing is historic. The regions ice could supply fuel, oxygen and drinking water for future missions. Landing on the south pole (of the moon) would actually allow India to explore if there is water ice on the moon. And this is very important for cumulative data and science on the geology of the moon, said Carla Filotico, a partner and managing director at consultancy SpaceTec Partners. Anticipation before the landing was feverish, with banner headlines across Indian newspapers and news channels running countdowns to the landing. Prayers were held at places of worship across the country, and schoolchildren waved the Indian tricolour as they waited for live screenings of the landing. Children gathered on the banks of the Ganga river, considered holy by Hindus, to pray for a safe landing, and mosques in several places offered prayers. At a Sikh temple, known as a gurduwara, in the capital New Delhi, Petroleum Minister Hardeep Singh Puri also offered prayers for Chandrayaan. Not just economic, but India is achieving scientific and technological progress as well, Puri told reporters. Source - Reuters --Agencies",

On the other hand, we will provide special facilities and consideration for the close relatives of the missing persons, he said, mentioning that as an example, some parents of the missing persons are on the waiting lists for kidney surgeries or heart surgeries at government hospitals. In such instances, we will talk to the relevant officials and provide these people with special facilities. If there are children in such families with a passion to learn, we will direct them to suitable institutions in order to obtain further education or to develop their skills as to engage in some sort of self-employment, the Chairman of the Office on Missing Persons said. Katulanda also highlighted the mechanism of the Office on Missing Persons includes supporting the rebuilding of the economy of any family that has been broken down due to missing persons. The number of missing people in the country is 14,988. We should also work in order to prevent such situations of enforced disappearances of people. We work for it, he added. As a country, we should be glad that no incident of enforced disappearance of an individual has been reported in 05 years, he claimed.",

        "content": "MOSCOW (AP)  A business jet en route from Moscow to St. Petersburg crashed Wednesday, killing all 10 people on board, Russian emergency officials said. Mercenary chief Yevgeny Prigozhin was on the passenger list, officials said, but it wasnt immediately clear if he was on board. Unconfirmed media reports said the jet belonged to Prigozhin, founder of the Wagner private military company. Russias civilian aviation regulator, Rosaviatsia, said Prigozhin was on the passenger list. However, it was not immediately clear if he had boarded the flight. Russias state news agency Tass cited emergency officials as saying that the plane carried three pilots and seven passengers. The authorities said they were investigating the crash, which occurred in the Tver region more than 100 kilometers (60 miles) north of Moscow. Prigozhin, whose private military force Wagner fought alongside Russias regular army in Ukraine, mounted a short-lived armed mutiny against Russias military leadership in late June. The Kremlin said he would be exiled to Belarus, and his fighters would either retire, follow him there, or join the Russian military. This is a developing story  Source: AP --Agencies",

        "content": "The Monetary Board of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka has decided to maintain the Standing Deposit Facility Rate (SDFR) and the Standing Lending Facility Rate (SLFR) of the Central Bank at their current levels of 11.00 per cent and 12.00 per cent, respectively. The Board arrived at this decision, at its meeting held on 23 August 2023, following a careful analysis of current and expected developments in the domestic as well as the global economy, while noting the significant easing of monetary conditions effected since June 2023, the CBSL said. The Monetary Board took note of the downward adjustment of market interest rates in response to monetary policy easing measures implemented thus far and the need to allow space for further adjustment of market interest rates swiftly, the release said. However, the Board observed that market interest rates of certain lending products remain excessive and are not in line with the current monetary policy stance. Moreover, the Board anticipates a faster reduction in overall market lending interest rates in line with the recent monetary policy easing measures. Accordingly, the Board decided to adopt targeted administrative measures to reduce specific lending interest rates that it considered to be excessive and direct the licensed banks to reduce overall rupee lending interest rates by an appropriate margin in the period ahead, the central bank said.",

        "content": "The Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) says its Monetary Board has decided to impose caps on interest rates on pawning facilities, pre-arranged temporary overdrafts and credit cards for all licensed banks. Accordingly, the maximum interest rate for pawning facilities is set at 18 per annum, 23 per annum for pre-arranged temporary overdrafts, and 28 per annum for credit cards. Further, the Monetary Board is of the view that penal interest rates need to be capped at 2 percentage points over the regular interest rates charged on the relevant credit facility, the CBSL said further in its latest Monetary Policy Review. In addition to the above, the Monetary Board has noted that other market lending interest rates on rupee loans and advances should also adjust downwards further, in line with the relaxed Monetary Policy 5 stance. The CBSL said directives would be issued shortly to make these regulated interest rates effective. These directions will be subject to further review to ensure that the overall lending interest rate structure remains in line with the monetary policy measures of the CBSL in the period ahead. The CBSL explained that targeted administrative measures are adopted to reduce specific lending interest rates that its Monetary Board considered to be excessive and direct the licensed banks to reduce overall rupee lending interest rates by an appropriate margin in the period ahead.",

        "title": "Japans Fukushima nuclear plant begins releasing treated radioactive wastewater into sea",
        "date": "August 24, 2023 10:47 am",
        "content": "The operator of the tsunami-wrecked Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant says it began releasing its first batch of treated radioactive water into the Pacific Ocean on Thursday  a controversial step, but a milestone for Japans battle with the growing radioactive water stockpile. In a live video from a control room at the plant, Tokyo Electric Power Company Holdings showed a staff member turn on a seawater pump with a click of a mouse, marking the beginning of the controversial project that is expected to last for decades. Seawater Pump A activated, the main operator said, confirming the release was underway. TEPCO later confirmed that the seawater pump was activated at 1:03 p.m. (0403 GMT), three minutes after the final step began. TEPCO said an additional wastewater release pump was activated 20 minutes after the first. Plant officials said everything was moving smoothly so far. Japanese fisher groups have opposed the plan for fear it will further damage to the reputation of their seafood. Groups in China and South Korea have also raised concern, making it a political and diplomatic issue. But the Japanese government and TEPCO say the water must be released to make room for the plants decommissioning and to prevent accidental leaks. They say the treatment and dilution will make the wastewater safer than international standards and its environmental impact will be negligibly small. But some scientists say long-term impact of the low-dose radioactivity that remains in the water needs attention. The water release begins more than 12 years after the March 2011 nuclear meltdowns, caused by a massive earthquake and tsunami. It marks a milestone for the plants battle with an ever-growing radioactive water stockpile that TEPCO and the government say have hampered the daunting task of removing the fatally toxic melted debris from the reactors. The pump activated Thursday afternoon sent the first batch of the diluted, treated water from a mixing pool to a secondary pool 10 minutes later. It then moves through a connected undersea tunnel to go out 1 kilometer (0.6 miles) off the coast. Officials said the water moves at a walking speed and will take about 30 minutes to exit from the tunnel. The operator checked data and the progress on a set of four monitors that show the water volume, pump conditions and any alerts. TEPCO executive Junichi Matsumoto said Thursdays release was planned start small in order to ensure safety. The wastewater is collected and partly recycled as cooling water after treatment, with the rest stored in around 1,000 tanks, which are already filled to 98 of their 1.37-million-ton capacity. Those tanks, which cover much of the plant complex, must be freed up to build the new facilities needed for the decommissioning process, officials said. Final preparation for the release began Tuesday, when just one ton of treated water was sent from a tank for dilution with 1,200 tons of seawater, and the mixture was kept in the primary pool for two days for final sampling to ensure safety, Matsumoto said. A batch of 460 tons was to be sent to the mixing pool Thursday for the actual discharge. Fukushimas fisheries, tourism and economy  which are still recovering from the disaster  worry the release could be the beginning of a new hardship. Fukushimas current fish catch is only about one-fifth its pre-disaster level, in part due to a decline in the fishing population. China has tightened radiation testing on Japanese products from Fukushima and nine other prefectures, halting exports at customs for weeks, Fisheries Agency officials said. Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said the release is indispensable and and could not be postponed. He noted an experimental removal of a small amount of the melted debris from the No. 2 reactor is set for later this year using a remote-controlled giant robotic arm. In 2021, the Japanese government announced plans to release the treated water to the sea. Then, on Sunday, Kishida made a rushed visit to the plant before meeting with fisheries representatives and pledging to support their livelihoods until the release ends. The hurried timeline raised skepticism that it was made to fit Kishidas busy political schedule in September. But Economy and Industry Ministry officials say they wanted the release to start as early as possible and have good safety records ahead of the fall fishing season. The March 2011 earthquake and tsunami destroyed the plants cooling systems, causing three reactors to melt. Highly contaminated cooling water applied to the damaged reactors has leaked continuously to building basements and mixed with groundwater. TEPCO plans to release 31,200 tons of the treated water by the end of March 2024, which would empty only 10 tanks because of the contaminated production of wastewater at the plant, though the pace will later pick up.

        "title": "Wagner boss Yevgeny Prigozhin presumed dead in a plane crash outside Moscow",
        "date": "August 24, 2023 11:31 am",
        "content": "Mercenary leader Yevgeny Prigozhin, who led a brief armed rebellion against the Russian military earlier this year, was presumed dead Wednesday after a plane crash north of Moscow that killed all 10 people on board. Prigozhin was on the plane, according to Russias civil aviation agency, which cited the airline. The crash immediately raised suspicions since the fate of the founder of the Wagner private military company has been the subject of intense speculation ever since he mounted the mutiny. At the time, President Vladimir Putin denounced the rebellion as treason and a stab in the back and vowed to avenge it. But the charges against Prigozhin were soon dropped. The Wagner chief, whose troops were some of the best fighting forces for Russia in Ukraine, was allowed to retreat to Belarus, while reportedly popping up in Russia from time to time. The crash also comes after Russian media reported that a top general linked to Prigozhin was dismissed from his position as commander of the air force. A plane carrying three crew members and seven passengers that was en route from Moscow to St. Petersburg went down almost 300 kilometers (185 miles) north of the capital, according to officials cited by Russias state news agency Tass. Russias civilian aviation agency, Rosaviatsia, quickly reported that he was on the manifest and later said that, according to the airline, he was indeed on board. Earlier, Vladimir Rogov, a Russia-appointed official in the partially occupied Zaporizhzhia region in Ukraine, said he talked to Wagner commanders who also confirmed that Prigozhin was aboard, as was Dmitry Utkin, whose call sign Wagner became the companys name. I dont know for a fact what happened but Im not surprised, U.S. President Joe Biden said. Keir Giles, a Russia expert with the international affairs think tank Chatham House, had urged caution about reports of Prigozhins death. He said multiple individuals have changed their name to Yevgeniy Prigozhin, as part of his efforts to obfuscate his travels. Flight tracking data reviewed by The Associated Press showed a private jet that Prigozhin had used previously took off from Moscow on Wednesday evening and its transponder signal disappeared minutes later. The signal stopped suddenly while the plane was at altitude and traveling at speed. In an image posted by a pro-Wagner social media account showing burning wreckage, a partial tail number matching a jet previously used by Prigozhin could be seen. Videos shared by the pro-Wagner Telegram channel Grey Zone showed a plane dropping like a stone from a large cloud of smoke, twisting wildly as it fell. Such freefalls can occur when an aircraft sustains severe damage, and a frame-by-frame AP analysis of two videos was consistent with some sort of explosion mid-flight. The images appeared to show the plane was missing a wing. Russias Investigative Committee opened an investigation into the crash on charges of violating air safety rules, as is typical when they open such probes. Interfax, citing emergency officials, reported early Thursday that all 10 bodies had been recovered at the site of the crash and the search operation had ended. Even if confirmed, Prigozhins death is unlikely to have an effect on Russias war in Ukraine, where his forces fought some of the fiercest battles over the past 18 months. His troops pulled back from front-line action after capturing Bakhmut, a city in the eastern Donetsk region, in late May. Bakhmut had been the subject of arguably the bloodiest battles in the entire war, with the Russian forces struggling to seize it for months. After the rebellion, Russian officials said his fighters would only be able to return to Ukraine as part of the regular army. This week, Prigozhin posted his first recruitment video since the mutiny, saying that Wagner is conducting reconnaissance and search activities, and making Russia even greater on all continents, and Africa even more free.  Also this week, Russian media reported, citing anonymous sources, that Gen. Sergei Surovikin was dismissed from his position of the commander of Russias air force. Surovikin, who at one point led Russias operation in Ukraine, hasnt been seen in public since the mutiny, when he recorded a video address urging Prigozhins forces to pull back. As news of the crash was breaking, Putin spoke at an event commemorating the Battle of Kursk, hailing the heroes of Russias war in Ukraine. Tatiana Stanovaya, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center, said on Telegram that no matter what caused the plane crash, everyone will see it as an act of vengeance and retribution by the Kremlin, and the Kremlin wouldnt really stand in the way of that. From Putins point of view, as well as the security forces and the military  Prigozhins death must be a lesson to any potential followers, Stanovaya said in a Telegram post. According to her, after the mutiny, Prigozhin stopped being the authorities partner and could not, under any circumstances, get that status back. He also wasnt forgiven, Stanovaya wrote. Prigozhin was needed for some time after the mutiny to painlessly complete the dismantling of Wagner in Russia. But overall, alive, happy, full-of-strength and full-of-ideas Prigozhin was, definitely, a walking source of threats for the authorities, the embodiment of Putins political humiliation. Stanovaya doesnt expect much public outcry over Prigozhins death. She said those who supported him will be more scared than inspired to protest, while others would see it as a deserved outcome.

        "date": "August 24, 2023 12:20 pm",
        "content": "The newly constructed Polpitiya-Hambantota 220kV transmission line has been connected to the national grid, upon completion of its preliminary work. Meanwhile, the new grid substation in Hambantota was also energized on Thursday (Aug. 24), the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) said. The project was funded by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to develop the Polpitiya-Hambantota 220kV transmission line and Hambantota new grid substation with an investment of USD 55 million. According to the state-owned utility, this 150km-long transmission line runs through 11 Divisional Secretariats from Ambagamuwa to Hambantota and the line capacity is 580MVA. The Hambantota new grid substation has been completed with two power transformers with a total capacity of 500MVA. With this transmission network improvement, the Southern part of the electric grid will be strengthened, thereby increasing the reliability of power supply and power transfer capability to and from the Southern region, the CEB added. Earlier this month, the Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL) managed to pull off the mediation of a resolution to a dispute between the CEB and the landowners in Siripagama area of Ratnapura which revolved around a segment of the transmission line that connects the national grid with the Southern Province, passing through the said plot of land. Private appraisers had initially recommended a compensation of Rs. 41 million for the land used during the construction of a 630-meter section of the transmission line and this amount was later revised to Rs. 9.6 million following the criteria of the Asian Development Fund of the ADB. However, the CEB had only agreed to offer Rs. 1.69 million as compensation. After the PUCSL intervened to resolve the matter, the landowners, the landowners had demonstrated their commitment to contribute to a seamless electricity supply for the public by agreeing to donate the land to the government without any compensation. This paved way for the commencement of the construction of the transmission line. The agreed-upon terms included the construction of the electric cable through the private land with a minimum height requirement of 20m, adhering to regulations pertaining to condition and continuity.",

Sri Lanka is proud of this historic and momentous achievement, Wickremesinghe said in a letter addressed to PM Modi. In a letter addressed to Indian PM Narendra Modi, President Ranil Wickremesinghe extended his heartiest congratulations to the Prime Minister, the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and the people of India, on the remarkable achievement of Chandrayaan-3s successful soft landing on the lunar south pole, and that being the first time in history. The President upheld that Sri Lanka having India as the closest neighbour sharing a robust timeless relationship and with both countries being members of the South Asian family, and observed that, it is with immense pride that the nation is celebrating this historic and momentous achievement, the PMD reported. Sri Lankan leader said PM Modis generous gesture of dedicating this accomplishment to all of mankind will inspire generations to pursue the advancement of scientific and technological progress. He bestowed best wishes for success in Indias endeavours to attain its future vision of exploring other planets in the solar system. Indian spacecraft Chandrayaan-3  which means moon vehicle in Hindi and Sanskrit  made history on Wednesday (Aug. 23) as it successfully landed on the moon, in a mission seen as crucial to lunar exploration and establishing Indias standing as a moon power. Indias mission became the first the land on the South Pole region of the moon. This was Indias second attempt to land a spacecraft on the moon and came less than a week after Russias Luna-25 mission failed. In 2019, ISROs Chandrayaan-2 mission successfully deployed an orbiter but its lander crashed. The Chandrayaan-3 is expected to remain functional for two weeks, running a series of experiments including a spectrometer analysis of the mineral composition of the lunar surface. Rough terrain makes a South Pole landing difficult, and a first landing is historic. The regions ice could supply fuel, oxygen and drinking water for future missions. -with inputs from agencies",

        "content": "A circular focusing on measures to accelerate the fall in market lending rates is due to be issued by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka on Friday (25 Aug). Accordingly, a circular is due to be issued tomorrow focusing on methods to ensure that the lending rates reflect the recent Monetary Policy relaxation, CBSL Governor Dr. Nandalal Weerasinghe explained. He further added that the expectation of at least a 3 reduction in interest rates by December will also be reflected in these methods. Dr. Weerasinghe made these remarks during a press conference held at the Central Bank this afternoon. In late July, the CBSL governor had urged the licensed commercial banks to take immediate measures to adequately reduce lending rates in view of the policy interest rate cuts, stating that Such rigidity of lending rates would be counterproductive in the process of envisaged economic recovery. Dr. Nandalal Weerasinghe, in a letter directed to the Sri Lanka Banks Association (SLBA) chairman, had emphasized that the Central Bank would be compelled to take administrative measures in the event the banking and financial sector fails to take adequate and expeditious adjustments in this regard. Explaining that the central bank recently dropped the policy interest rates by 450 bps on two occasions with a view to enabling the economy to reach its potential while stabilising inflation at mid-single digit levels in the medium term and easing pressures in the financial markets, the governor said it is thus expected that market interest rates  particularly lending rates  will adjust downwards adequately and swiftly. He further noted that such efforts would enable individuals and businesses to re-commence or continue the repayment of credit facilities and improve the sustainability of borrowers which will lead to a positive impact on the real sector resulting in the banking sector performance to improve.",

        "date": "August 24, 2023 03:47 pm",
        "content": "Minister of Education Susil Premajayantha states that a special cabinet paper will be submitted in order to fill the existing graduate teaching vacancies. Accordingly, the relevant cabinet paper will be prepared so as to authorize the provincial councils to fill the vacancies created due to the retirement of teachers and the teachers who have left the service, the Minister said in the parliament today (24). He further expressed that the provincial councils have already been authorized to recruit 5,400 graduate teachers for the subjects of Mathematics, Science and Technology streams. In addition, the minister who pointed out that there are around 32,000 teacher vacancies currently, also mentioned that various obstacles have arisen to fill those vacancies. Meanwhile, the State Minister for Education Aravinda Kumar announced plans for the recruitment of 8,000 teachers for government schools in the near future. He indicated that these recruitments will include 5,500 graduate teachers and 2,500 teachers specializing in second language instruction. These comments were made by the State Minister of Education, during his participation in a press conference at the Presidential Media Centre (PMC) yesterday (23) under the theme Collective Path to a stable country, the Presidents Media Division (PMD) said.",

        "title": "Dutch State Secretary to visit Sri Lanka for ownership transfer of colonial-era treasures",
        "date": "August 24, 2023 04:05 pm",
        "content": "A Dutch cultural delegation is scheduled to visit Sri Lanka from August 27 - 31 to sign the legal document transferring the ownership of the cultural artifacts that will be returned to the island nation later this year. The delegation will be led by Gunay Uslu, the State Secretary for Cultural and Media in the Netherlands. The official delegation will consist of Barbera Wolfensberger, Director General Culture and Media in the Netherlands; Lilian Gonçalves-Ho Kang You, Chairperson of Dutch Colonial Collections Committee; and Dr. Alicia Schrikker, a Member of the Committee. The objects planned to be returned include the famous Lewkes canon, two Gold kastanes (ceremonial swords), a Sinhalese knife, a Silver kastane and two guns. (A 1765 cannon looted from Sri Lanka displayed at the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam, Netherlands) The Embassy of the Kingdom of the Netherlands in Colombo said the visiting State Secretary is expected to meet with the senior officials of the Sri Lankan government to mark this historic moment. The legal transfer of ownership will be signed at the Ministry of Buddhasasana, Religious  Cultural Affairs of Sri Lanka on August 28 (Monday). The delegation will visit a few places with religious and Dutch historic value in Sri Lanka. With regard to the return of cultural artifacts, the embassy said the Netherlands, while acknowledging both the tangible and intangible heritage of Dutch colonial times in Sri Lanka, is critically looking at its own role in history. In 2021 the Dutch government approved the policy for the return of cultural heritage objects that are in the possession of the Dutch State. The indigenous populations of colonial territories were served an injustice through the involuntary loss of objects that formed part of their cultural heritage, says the Dutch government. Therefore Dutch government is keen to help rectify this historic injustice by returning cultural heritage objects to their country of origin and by strengthening international cooperation in this area, the embassy said further. In December 2022, the Dutch government appointed an independent commission, the Advisory Committee on the Return of Cultural Objects from Colonial Context, chaired by Lilian Gonçalves-Ho Kang You, to assess and facilitate the return of colonial objects to their respective countries of origin. At the request of Sri Lanka, this committee decided in July this year to advise to return 6 objects of cultural significance that were wrongfully brought to the Netherlands during the colonial period. In 2021, researchers from both countries studied the provenance (background) of these objects extensively. In 1765, these items were taken as loot by the Dutch from the Kandyan Kingdom during the siege of the Palace. The embassy said the people of the Netherlands feel a moral obligation to return looted or otherwise wrongfully acquired objects to their rightful owners. Righting the wrongs of the past is needed to heal the historic wounds. The return process is expected to form the basis for further cooperation between the two countries and the cultural institutions concerned. The cooperation will mainly be focused on the exchange of technical expertise, knowledge sharing and education.",

        "date": "August 24, 2023 05:04 pm",
        "content": "Agriculture Minister Mahinda Amaraweera has assured that the country has ample stocks of rice that can sustain the upcoming Maha cultivation season. Hence, there is no need for rice imports, the lawmaker told a gathering of experts organized by the Presidents Trade Union Relations Division at the Presidential Secretariat on Wednesday (Aug. 23). The focus of the meeting was on the subject of Modernization of the Agro-Industrial Sector and its Challenges, the PMD said. Owing to the accomplishments of the season and the cautious supply of all three essential fertilizers coupled with financial assistance, we possess ample rice reserves to bridge the gap until the forthcoming harvest of the Maha Season. Despite the current drought conditions leading to the devastation of approximately 75,000 acres, the minister said provinces unaffected by this dry weather spell are experiencing notably high yields. Consequently, there remains no necessity to resort to rice imports from other countries. Speaking on the recent hike in rice prices, Amaraweera said this necessitates effective management. As the Minister of Agriculture, I perceive the rise in paddy prices as a positive development, yet it is imperative to avert any inconvenience to consumers. To this end, it is vital to establish an appropriate framework for regulating paddy and rice prices, Amaraweera said noting that addressing this challenge is pivotal to optimizing harvests from the countrys limited arable land. He also highlighted the success of the previous cultivation season, attributing it to the prompt supply of all essential fertilizer types to farmers, along with financial concessions, and robust yields in regions unaffected by drought further contributing to the seasons prosperity. Further, the minister underscored the importance of transcending political influences in the dissemination of accurate information among farmers has yielded positive outcomes. He said the effective transmission of accurate seed paddy information to farmers stands as a crucial prerequisite for the success of all forthcoming agricultural endeavours. Additionally, imparting knowledge about modern technologies and their associated advantages is of paramount importance. When executed proficiently, these initiatives hold the potential to yield a surplus of rice production from our paddy fields. Addressing the gathering, the agriculture minister elaborated on the agricultural landscape. He also conveyed his perspectives on the imperative of enhancing the agro-industrial domain to meet contemporary challenges.",

        "title": "Georgia school district is banning books, citing sexual content, after firing a teacher",
        "date": "August 24, 2023 05:05 pm",
        "content": "Georgias second-largest school district says that it has removed two books from 20 school libraries, saying the books had highly inappropriate, sexually explicit content. The announcement, sent in an electronic message to parents in some Cobb County schools on Monday, comes days after the Republican-majority school board voted 4-3 along party lines to fire a teacher for reading a book about gender identity to fifth-grade students. Although not new, book removals have surged since 2020, part of a backlash to what kids read and discuss in public schools. Conservatives want to stop children from reading books with themes on sexuality, gender, race and religion that they find objectionable. PEN America, a group promoting freedom of expression, counted 4,000 instances of books banned nationwide from July 2021 to December 2022. Cobb County, with 106,000 students, said Tuesday that 20 libraries had contained Flamer by Mike Curato or Me and Earl and the Dying Girl by Jesse Andrews, or both. Flamer is a graphic novel about a boy who is discovering he is gay and how he is treated at summer camp. Me and Earl and the Dying Girl contains some discussion of sex and a lot of profanity, but is mainly about two high school boys who befriend a girl dying of cancer. Both were among the most challenged books of 2022, according to a list published by the American Library Association. Protecting our students from sexually explicit content isnt controversial, its what our parents expect, John Floresta, the districts chief strategy and accountability officer. Our board and superintendent are clear  any book, video, or lesson which contains sexually explicit content is entirely unacceptable and has no place in our schools. Jeff Hubbard, president of the Cobb County Association of Educators, said media specialists were being questioned about when they had bought the books and why. Such interviews could be a prelude to the librarians being disciplined or fired. The district didnt respond to questions about whether officials intended to take disciplinary action. Theyre scared to death, and one parent complaint could cost them a career, Hubbard said. Nan Brown, an advocacy coordinator for the Georgia Media Library Association, said its important that students be able to see themselves and others in books. She questioned in particular the removal of Flamer, noting Georgia librarians nominated it for a statewide award. No book is perfect for everybody all the time, Brown said. But that book is really important to some children. Hubbard said he fears teachers will feel compelled to censor classroom libraries after the district fired Katie Rinderle. An elementary school teacher, she got into trouble in March for reading the picture book My Shadow Is Purple, by Scott Stuart, after which some parents complained. Rinderle said a board policy prohibiting teaching on controversial issues was so vague that she couldnt know what was barred. The district didnt respond to questions about who asked that the books be removed or if the district intends to remove additional books. In an electronic message, which Hubbard said was sent Monday to parents at all 20 schools, the district stated that With thousands of books purchased over decades, we are making every effort to ensure our library only includes materials that are aligned to Georgia standards, supported by law and CCSD policy, and contain content that is age appropriate for our students. Hubbard said the book removals and Rindereles firing have been a train wreck for morale in Cobb County, which has the states highest-paid teachers. Both Hubbard and Brown questioned whether Cobb County followed its own policies or a new state law laying out how book challenges should be handled. Cobb County, in response to an open records request by The Associated Press in June, said it had no records of challenges filed under the Georgia law, in effect since Jan. 01. The AP filed a request this month seeking records of books Cobb might have removed without a challenge. The district estimated it would cost 2,822 to produce those records. Some other large Georgia school districts provided records without charge. Brown said Cobbs action reminded her of a decision in Forsyth County, another large suburban Atlanta district, to remove eight books in early 2022. After others pushed back, the system put all the books except for one back on shelves. The U.S. Department of Education later warned that Forsyth schools, based on discussions in board meetings, may have created a hostile environment violating federal laws against race and sex discrimination, leading to increased fears and possibly harassment among students.

        "title": "Big Tech braces for EU Digital Services Act regulations",
        "date": "August 24, 2023 05:21 pm",
        "content": "More than a dozen of the world biggest tech companies face unprecedented legal scrutiny, as the European Union sweeping Digital Services Act (DSA) imposes new rules on content moderation, user privacy and transparency. From Friday, a host of internet giants  including Meta Facebook and Instagram platforms, Apple online App Store, and a handful of Google services  will face new obligations in the EU, including preventing harmful content from spreading, banning or limiting certain user-targeting practices, and sharing some internal data with regulators and associated researchers. The EU is seen as the global leader in tech regulation, with more wide-ranging pieces of legislation  such as the Digital Markets Act and the AI Act  on the way. The bloc success in implementing such laws will influence the introduction of similar rules around the world. But researchers have raised questions over whether these companies have done enough to meet lawmakers expectations. For now, the rules only apply to 19 of the largest online platforms, those with more than 45 million users in the EU. From mid-February, however, they will apply to a variety of online platforms, regardless of size. Any firm found in breach of the DSA faces a fine worth up to 6 of its global turnover, and repeat offenders may be banned from operating in Europe altogether. Reuters asked each company designated under the DSA to discuss changes they had made. Most pointed to public blog posts on the matter, declining to comment further, or did not respond at all. Two of the companies singled out for early regulation  e-commerce giant Amazon and German fashion retailer Zalando  are currently challenging their inclusion on the list in court. We can expect that platforms will fight tooth and nail to defend their practices, said Kingsley Hayes, head of data and privacy litigation at law firm Keller Postman. Especially when new compliance rules encroach on their core business models. STRESS TESTS Over the past few months, the European Commission said it had offered to conduct DSA stress tests with the 19 platforms. Such tests assessed whether these platforms could detect, address and mitigate systemic risks, such as disinformation, a Commission spokesperson said. At least five platforms have participated in such tests -- Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, TikTok and Snapchat. In each case, the Commission said more work was needed to prepare for the DSA. Now, just as the rules come into effect, research published on Thursday by nonprofit Eko shows Facebook was still approving online ads containing harmful content. The organization submitted 13 ads containing harmful content for approval, including one inciting violence against immigrants and another calling for the assassination of a prominent Member of the European Parliament (MEP). Eko said Facebook approved eight of the submitted ads within 24 hours and rejected five. Researchers removed the ads before they were published, so no Facebook users saw them. In response to the Eko research, Meta said, This report was based on a very small sample of ads and is not representative of the number of ads we review daily across the world. This year Global Witness, another nonprofit, claimed Facebook, TikTok and Google YouTube had all approved ads inciting violence against the LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender) community in Ireland. Responding to the Global Witness research, both Meta and TikTok said at the time that hate speech had no place on their platforms, and that they regularly review and improve their procedures. Google did not respond to a request for comment. TRICKY BUSINESS While none of the designated companies have said they will disobey the DSA, Amazon and Zalando have disputed their inclusion on the list. In July, Amazon filed a legal challenge with the Luxembourg-based General Court, Europe second highest, arguing that bigger rivals in these countries had not been designated. It has still introduced a number of new features as part of its DSA compliance programme, such as a new channel for users to report incorrect product information. Fashion retailer Zalando launched a similar legal challenge, arguing that because only 31 million monthly active users bought from third-party sellers on its platform, it fell below the 45 million user threshold. It will soon become obvious if any of the designated companies had skirted their legal responsibilities, said Hayes. Ironing these obligations out will be a tricky business for any platform with a large user base. Source - Reuters --Agencies",

        "date": "August 24, 2023 05:52 pm",
        "content": "The President and Chief Executive Officer of the National Gem and Jewellery Authority Viraj de Silva stated that they anticipate generating annual revenue of US 2 billion by the year 2025 through the export of gems, the Presidents Media Division (PMD) reported. The chairman highlighted that during the initial 7 months of this year, they have already amassed a revenue of US 312 million through gem exports. They further project that by the end of this year, the earnings will reach US 500 million. He also focused attention to the implementation of a programme in accordance with President Ranil Wickremesinghes directives, aimed at curbing the illegal export of gems. This illegal export has posed a significant challenge to achieving the US 2 billion target, the PMD said in a statement. Consequently, Viraj de Silva indicated that necessary measures will be promptly taken to facilitate direct gem purchases by foreign buyers through auctions within the country. These insights were shared by Viraj De Silva, the Chairman of the National Gem and Jewellery Authority, during his participation in the 101 Katha programme produced by the Presidential Media Division. Expressing his views further Mr de Silva said; The Gem and Jewellery Authority Act governs a range of regulatory tasks, spanning from authorizing mining permits to overseeing the export of gemstones. Our regulatory responsibilities encompass processes such as auctions, sales and international shipments. All of these endeavours are geared towards benefiting the nation. Furthermore, we undertake both local and international promotional initiatives, with a strong emphasis on maximizing foreign exchange inflow into the country. With six regional offices scattered across the nation, the Gem and Jewellery Authority actively monitors activities through these branches. Notably, gems discovered within mines cannot be sold arbitrarily; rather, they must be presented at public auctions in accordance with the nations legal stipulations. This practice ensures transparency and adherence to the law. From the proceeds of gemstone sales, the government receives a share amounting to 2.5. Recent events have showcased a substantial growth in mining activities, resulting in the sale of a gem worth a remarkable Rs. 400 million. This upsurge in mining efforts has contributed to a notable increase in the revenue generated from gem sales. Stringent conditions are placed on the operation of gem mines. Any engagement in illegal mining activities can lead to the revocation of licenses. Furthermore, the exportation of gemstones is subject to specific protocols. Following the discovery of a gemstone, it must undergo a process of polishing and subsequent auctioning under the auspices of the Gem and Jewellery Authority. Currently, an investigation is underway to identify instances where activities are being conducted without the approval of the Gem and Jewellery Authority. President Ranil Wickremesinghe has also issued directives to delve into this matter, reflecting the seriousness with which these issues are being addressed. Between January and July of this year, the export of gems has generated a substantial income of US 312 million. However, there exists untapped potential for even greater financial gains. In contrast to other sectors, the Gem and Jewellery Authority has achieved an impressive export growth rate of 34. Notably, this growth rate surpasses that of the tea and garment industries, as evidenced by reports from the Central Bank. Gems discovered in this manner are the collective property of the entire nation. It is imperative that the country receives their rightful value. This could prove invaluable in alleviating the current economic challenges. The export of gems has the potential to yield an average annual income of US 2 billion. Sri Lanka should aspire to become a prominent hub for gem trade on the global stage. Our on-going efforts reflect this ambition, with the projected income from the gem industry expected to reach US 500 million by years end. Expanding the number of exporters engaged in these activities is a crucial endeavour. Presently, everyday citizens participate in this industry. We have initiated a program aimed at expanding the gem export process, inviting those interested in the field to join us in this endeavour. Our primary objective is to identify buyers and cultivate new markets. Furthermore, proactive measures have been implemented to prevent irregularities within the Gem and Jewellery Authority. To address the potential for financial improprieties arising from long-term officer tenure, a formal transfer policy has been introduced. Additionally, the integration of accounting software has effectively eliminated any room for financial misconduct. It is also within our institutions responsibility to validate the quality of gold items owned by Sri Lankan citizens. Thus, individuals have the option to visit our office and assess the quality of their gold possessions. The certification bestowed by the Gem and Jewellery Authority significantly enhances the value of ones gold items.",

        "content": "State Minister of Piriven Education, Vijitha Beirugoda has assured that issues pertaining to the pension for Piriven teachers will be resolved soon. Emphasising the need to amend the Pension Act and the Piriven Education Act, Beirugoda stated that the recommendations provided by the Department of Pension, Department of Attorney General, and the Department of Legal Draftsman are currently undergoing the approval process by the Cabinet Ministers. During his participation in a press conference at the Presidential Media Centre (PMC) today (24 Aug) under the theme Collective Path to a stable country, Berugoda underscored the deep-rooted connection between villages and temples, while praising Piriven education, rooted in the Maha Vihara education system, for its historical significance in nurturing learned and mature Maha Sangha, who are considered as the guardians of the nation. There are 822 piriven spanning five main sections across 22 out of the 25 districts of the country. With more than 8,000 staff members, including 7,591 teachers, these institutions serve 40,941 novice priests and 36,990 lay students. Despite the current economic challenges, President Ranil Wickremesinghe has played a significant role in advancing education within the nation. This has enabled the Ministry of Education to actively address issues faced by the Piriven education system. The Piriven system collects 12 of teachers monthly salaries for pension, a practice not applied to other school teachers or government employees. Efforts are underway to rectify this disparity. However, the Ministry of Public Administration has stressed the need to amend the Pension Act and the Piriven Education Act due to significant inconsistencies. Collaboratively, the Ministry of Public Administration and the Ministry of Education are in the process of submitting a joint Cabinet Paper, adhering to the recommendations from relevant departments. Efforts for infrastructural development are also on-going across all districts, supported by Annual budget as well as from the Embassies of the Buddhist Countries and philanthropists from Sri Lanka and other Buddhist countries. Along with that a Piriven Fund has been initiated to strengthen Piriven education. The Ministry has ensured that Piriven institutions receive essential facilities similar to regular government schools and are introduced to a novel Smart Education System. Moreover, the concept of the village and the temple, which may have grown distant, is being addressed through a program called Sil Suwadai  Hela Diviyai with the aim of reuniting these vital components. This initiative is expected to bolster the education system by preserving the tradition of novice monks.",

        "date": "August 24, 2023 10:13 pm",
        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe addressing a special Committee meeting drew parallels to the successful implementation of the Mahaweli Development Project during the 1980s, affirming a similar commitment to expediting the Eastern Development Project. He emphasized the imperative of fostering a conducive environment that reinvigorates the nations economy, stressing on the need to engage Indias assistance for this endeavoUr. Highlighting the strategic importance of the endeavour, President Wickremesinghe underscored the comprehensive vision for Trincomalees transformation into a multifaceted hub encompassing energy, transportation, maritime commerce, naval operations, aviation, industry, and tourism. He underscored the collaborative role of India in realizing this strategic program. These remarks were made during a special meeting presided over by President Wickremesinghe at the Trincomalee Air Force Base today (24). The session prominently addressed the meticulous administration of government and Mahaweli-designated land within the district. The President duly instructed officials to provide him with a comprehensive report encompassing land allocations spanning the period 2019 to 2023. President Wickremesinghe asserted that land stands as the essential factor of the development trajectory. He highlighted the importance of vigilant management for the achievement of desired developmental objectives. In addition, the President provided explicit guidance to cease the competitive establishment of religious sites. He advocated for a consultative approach in future undertakings concerning religious structures within the Trincomalee district. Decisions in this regard he said, should be reached in coordination with the governor, district political leaders, and relevant governmental authorities. President Ranil Wickremesinghe further commented, The convened meeting today was dedicated to deliberating upon the developmental initiatives within the Eastern Province, with particular emphasis on the Trincomalee district. Presently, a comprehensive plan formulated by Surbana Jurong pertains to the Trincomalee districts development, supported by an established agreement between Sri Lanka and India. It is vital that this accord is executed. The development strategy entails a meticulously crafted program aimed at the enhancement of the Kumana coastal stretch extending from Verugalaru to Panama. This expanse is envisioned to be harnessed for the advancement of the tourism sector. Simultaneously, a blueprint is in place for the establishment of modernized agriculture within this vicinity and this model is intended to be extended to other areas within the Eastern Province. The active involvement of both the Mahaweli Authority and the Land Department is envisaged in these pursuits. Anticipating an evolution in Trincomalees fishing, agriculture, and tourism sectors, the strategic goal is to elevate Trincomalee to a prominent commercial centre. Subsequent to this, the trajectory of development is envisaged to extend to Batticaloa and Ampara. The resolution of land-related issues, particularly concerning Mahaweli-designated land, is pivotal for the advancement of these endeavours. Pertinently, the execution of the Trincomalee Development Plan encompasses the acquisition of land in accordance with the 1985 Mahaweli scheme. However, there have been instances of land parcels within the Eastern Province being gazetted without the requisite approval of the Cabinet. Observations have indicated an allocation of land to various religious sites. Consequently, there is a directive to halt the competitive proliferation of such establishments. It is paramount to engage in comprehensive discussions with the provinces political leaders and religious dignitaries to reach judicious decisions in this regard. Recalling the Mahaweli Development Schemes implementation in 1985, certain lands bestowed by the Duke of Edinburgh have been designated as forests by the Ministry of Wildlife. While preserving the forested area at 32 per cent, it is envisaged that remaining lands should be harnessed for the countrys developmental pursuits. In the contemporary global landscape, nations such as Singapore and Dubai have strategically harnessed extensive land resources to propel their developmental pursuits. My recent visit to Singapore highlighted their interest in procuring rice from Sri Lanka. Notably, we had imported rice from them last year, and this year they are seeking rice from us. This underscores the need to establish modernized agricultural practices within our nation, thereby leveraging agricultural products as a means to fortify our global economic presence. The expeditious realization of our development objectives hinges on the prompt execution of the Eastern Development Plan. I hold the expectation that unwavering dedication to this cause will be demonstrated by all stakeholders, including government officials. In attendance at this crucial discourse were distinguished individuals, including Presidents Secretary, Saman Ekanayake, Sagala Ratnayake  Senior Adviser to the President on National Security and Chief of Staff to the President, Senthil Thondaman- Governor of the Eastern Province, Kapila Athukorala  Member of Parliament for the Eastern Province, Air Force Commander, Vice Air Marshal Udeni Rajapaksa, as well as other esteemed public representatives of the province and various provincial government officials.",

        "title": "Donald Trump surrenders at jail in Georgia election case, gets mug shot taken",
        "date": "August 25, 2023 08:42 am",
        "content": "A scowling Donald Trump posed for a mug shot Thursday as he surrendered inside a jail in Atlanta on charges that he illegally schemed to overturn the 2020 election in Georgia, creating a historic and humbling visual underscoring the former presidents escalating legal troubles. The booking photo instantly becomes part of the former presidents legacy as he confronts criminal charges in four American cities while seeking to reclaim the White House. His aides swiftly seized on the image, fundraising off the first mug shot in American history of a former president as representative of the persecution they contend Trump is encountering. His opponents, meanwhile, are likely to use it to remind voters of dangers in electing a president facing dozens of felony charges. Trump was released on 200,000 bond and headed back to the airport for his return flight home to New Jersey, flashing a thumbs-up through the window of his sport utility vehicle as his motorcade left. Unrepentant but subdued after the brief jail visit, he again insisted that he did nothing wrong and called the case accusing him of subverting election results a travesty of justice. If you challenge an election, you should be able to challenge an election, he told reporters on the airport tarmac. Trumps surrender to law enforcement authorities, the fourth time this year, has by now become a familiar election-season routine in a way that belies the unprecedented spectacle of a former president, and current candidate, being booked on criminal charges. But his visit to Atlanta was notably different from the three past surrenders, unfolding at night and requiring him to visit a problem-plagued jail  rather than a courthouse. And unlike in other cities that did not require him to pose for a mug shot, a booking photo of him was taken. It depicts Trump, wearing a navy suit and red tie, angrily scowling at the camera, his brows furrowed as he stares into the lens. Before Trumps plane had crossed North Carolina, his campaign was already using the image to solicit contributions on a fundraising site. And for the first time since Jan. 8, 2021, he made a post on X, the website formerly known as Twitter, issuing a fundraising plea on the platform that prevented him from using his account after he helped spark the violent insurrection at the U.S. Capitol. This mugshot will forever go down in history as a symbol of Americas defiance of tyranny, said a Trump campaign fundraising email. He also called into conservative TV channel Newsmax to talk about what he said had been a very sad day for our country,. His jail visit created a remarkable split-screen visual during a 2024 Republican primary contest in which he remains the leading candidate, swiping the spotlight at least temporarily from his opponents and coming one day after a debate in Milwaukee where eight of his leading rivals sought to exploit Trumps absence by trying to stand out from the pack. Trump landed in Atlanta around 7 p.m. and was driven to jail for the booking process. He offered a wave and thumbs-up as he descended the steps of his private plane. He completed the process in a brisk 20 minutes, providing officials as is customary with his physical measurements: 6 foot 3 inches. 215 pounds. Blond or strawberry hair. And Trump, who for four years in the White House reveled in the title of Mr. President, was given the inmate number of P01135809. The Fulton County prosecution is the fourth criminal case against Trump since March, when he became the first former president in U.S. history to be indicted. Since then, hes faced federal charges in Florida and Washington, and this month he was indicted in Atlanta with 18 others  including his ex-chief of staff, Mark Meadows, and former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani  under a racketeering statute normally associated with gang members and organized crime. District Attorney Fani Willis had given all of the defendants until Friday afternoon to turn themselves in at the main Fulton County jail. Just ahead of his surrender, Trump hired a new lead attorney for the Georgia case. Prominent Atlanta criminal defense attorney Steve Sadow replaced another high-profile criminal defense attorney, Drew Findling, who had represented Trump as recently as Monday when his bond terms were negotiated. But by Thursday Findling was no longer part of the team, according to a person with knowledge of the change who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly. Sadow said in a statement that the president should never have been indicted. He is innocent of all the charges brought against him. Trump has repeatedly denied wrongdoing. He said in a social media post this week that he was being prosecuted for what he described in capital letters as a perfect phone call in which he asked the Republican secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger, to help him find 11,780 votes for him to overturn his loss in the state to Democrat Joe Biden. The Fulton County jail where Trump surrendered has long been a troubled facility. The Justice Department last month opened a civil rights investigation into conditions, citing filthy cells, violence and the death last year of a man whose body was found covered in insects in the main jails psychiatric wing. Three people have died in Fulton County custody in the past month. He did not spend much time there. His attorneys and prosecutors had already agreed to a 200,000 bond, plus conditions that include barring the former president from intimidating co-defendants, witnesses or victims in the case. Charles Shaw, CEO of Foster Bail Bonds in metro Atlanta, said his company put up Trumps 200,000 bond. Shaw said Trump paid his company 10  or 20,000  which is customary for bail bondsmen to charge. Shaw said he doesnt know Trump, but that Trumps Atlanta defense attorneys have a close business relationship with his company. Unlike in other jurisdictions, in Fulton County, arraignments  in which a defendant appears in court for the first time  generally happen after a defendant surrenders at the jail and completes the booking process, not on the same day. That means Trump may have to make another trip to Georgia in the coming weeks though the Fulton County Sheriffs Office has said some arraignments in the case may happen virtually if the judge permits. Or Trumps arraignment could be waived. Source: Associated Press -Agencies",

        "title": "Putin breaks silence over Wagner boss Prigozhins reported death",
        "date": "August 25, 2023 10:13 am",
        "content": "Vladimir Putin has broken his silence over Yevgeny Prigozhins reported death - some 24 hours after the Wagner chiefs private jet crashed. Russias president said the head of the mercenary group was a talented person who made serious mistakes in life. Mr Putin also sent condolences to the families of all 10 people said to be on board the plane that went down north-west of Moscow on Wednesday evening. However, he stopped short of explicitly confirming Prigozhins death. From the moment the plane came down, there has been frenzied speculation about what caused the deadly crash and whether Prigozhin was indeed on board, as stated on the passenger list. At a briefing on Thursday, a Pentagon spokesperson said the US believed the Wagner chief was likely killed in the crash. Villagers near the crash site in the Tver region say they heard a loud bang before seeing a plane falling out of the sky. One of the theories being investigated is whether a bomb was smuggled on board, reports in Russian media suggest. A US official told CBS News, the BBCs US partner, that the most likely cause appeared to be an explosion aboard the aircraft. What caused the explosion was not known, although a bomb was one possibility, the official added. Another theory, raised by a Prigozhin-linked Telegram channel, suggested that the jet had been shot down by Russian anti-aircraft forces. This has not been confirmed, and on Thursday the Pentagon said there was no information to indicate this. Ground staff in Moscows Sheremetyevo airport - where the plane took off heading for St Petersburg - are being questioned, and CCTV footage is being checked. Prigozhin - the leader of Russias Wagner mercenary group - was once known as a Putin loyalist. But after leading a short-lived mutiny in Russia in June, many observers described him as a dead man walking. The Kremlin stayed conspicuously silent after the crash. The following morning, President Putin even addressed the Brics summit in South Africa via video-link - but made no mention of the crash that much of the world was talking about. On Thursday evening, however, that changed. I would like to above all express words of the most sincere condolences to the families of all those who have died, he said in a televised meeting at his Kremlin residence. Initial data, he continued, suggested that Wagner employees were on board. These are people who have made a significant contribution to our common cause of fighting the neo-Nazi regime in Ukraine, Mr Putin said, repeating the Kremlins false narrative that Ukraine is aligned with Nazism. He used this accusation to justify his full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Turning to Prigozhin himself, Mr Putin said he had known him since the early 90s, and described him as a man with a complicated life. The Russian leader also had praise for Prigozhin and his fighters, in particular for their actions in Ukraine. He made serious mistakes in life. But he achieved results both for himself, and for the common good when I asked for it - like in the last few months. Despite speaking about Prigozhin in the past tense and offering his sympathy to the families of the victims, Mr Putin did not confirm the Wagner chiefs death. When Prigozhin and his armed men - including many convicts - launched their insurrection two months ago, Mr Putin described their actions as treachery and a stab in the back of Russia. He vowed to punish the perpetrators, who called off their march on Moscow only about 200km (125 miles) from the capital. However a deal was later reached that saw Wagner fighters given a choice - either join the Russian army or move to neighbouring Belarus, and you will face no punishment. The rollback surprised both ordinary Russians and experts, who were puzzled that the Wagner boss was apparently being allowed to travel freely across Russia and, it seemed, internationally. The Russian defence ministry has not commented. Russian forensic experts are now reported to have started the victims identification, but Mr Putin said DNA tests would take time. According to Russias civil aviation authority, Wagner co-founder Dmitry Utkin and the man who looked after Wagners finances, Valeriy Chekalov were also on the plane. All seven passengers and three crew members on board the plane are believed to have died. Source: BBC -Agencies",

        "date": "August 25, 2023 11:04 am",
        "content": "The Colombo Magistrates Court on Friday (Aug. 25) ordered the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) to arrest the suspects linked to the death of housemaid named R. Rajakumari, who died while in the custody of Welikada Police. Delivering the verdict of the womans post-mortem, Colombo Additional Magistrate Harshana Kekunawala gave the order this morning (Aug. 25). The verdict was delivered after careful examination of evidence and the findings in the post-mortem report submitted by the Judicial Medical Officer. Accordingly, the cause of death was ruled as hemorrhagic shock caused by damage to the deceaseds muscles after being attacked with a blunt weapon or similar force. Thus, the magistrate ordered the CID officers to arrest the suspects responsible for Rajakumaris death and produce them before the court. The magistrate ordered the case to be taken up again on October 27 and ordered the CID to submit a report on the progress of investigations on that day. Rajakumari, 41, a resident of Badulla, was arrested on May 11 based on a complaint made by her employer, famed producer Sudharma Nethicumara, claiming that she had stolen gold jewellery belonging to her. She had later died while in the custody of the Welikada Police, of which her relatives raised suspicions, alleging that she had been subjected to assault. When the case was taken up before Colombo Additional Magistrate Harshana Kekunawala today, the evidence hearing led by the Criminal Investigation Departments Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP) Meryl Ranjan Lamahewa was concluded. During a previous court proceeding, a witness, identified as Mahendran Suresh, had testified that he had seen Rajakumari being assaulted by the officers of Welikada police. He also divulged that two police officers had handcuffed him while he was at the Pettah bus stand and took him to a house at Cotta Road in Borella, where the deceased woman was employed. According to Suresh, both he and Rajakumari were handcuffed together, and at that point, she had been in good health. After bringing them to the Welikada police station, Suresh said two police officers had assaulted both him and Rajakumari, despite her employers pleas to resolve the issue in a non-violent manner. Later, disciplinary action was then taken against seven officers attached to the Welikada Police, with a Sub-Inspector (SI), two Sergeants and a Constable being interdicted while a Constable and two Women Constables were subsequently transferred.",

The statement from Beijing early on Friday provided little details on the talks, only saying that the two leaders had a candid and in-depth exchange of views on current China-India relations and other questions of shared interest. It noted that the talks had been held at Mr. Modis request. The statement said President Xi stressed that improving China-India relations serves the common interests of the two countries and peoples, and is also conducive to peace, stability and development of the world and the region.

Bagalays posting to Australia is important as India has very close ties with Canberra with bipartisan consensus. Santosh Jha, who was a key player in trying to push India-EU FTA, returns to Sri Lanka, which is playing both India and China at its convenience. Reeling in economic crisis like Chinas other ally Pakistan, Sri Lanka is still to respond positively to Indias strategic concerns vis-à-vis China and is playing host to Chinese surveillance ships and ballistic missile tracking ships in deep seaports of Colombo and Hambantota. It is still not clear who will replace Saurabh Kumar as Secretary (East) with the name of Jaideep Mazumdar, Indian Ambassador to Austria being mentioned as front-runner for the key post.

        "title": "Nearly 2 million excess deaths followed Chinas sudden end of COVID curbs - study",
        "date": "August 25, 2023 05:12 pm",
        "content": "Chinas abrupt move to dismantle its strict COVID-19 regime, which unleashed the virus onto its 1.4 billion residents, could have led to nearly 2 million excess deaths in the following two months, a new U.S. study shows. The study by the federally funded Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center in Seattle was taken from a sample of mortality data published by some universities in China and internet searches. It found an estimated 1.87 million excess deaths from all causes occurred among people over 30 years of age between December 2022 and January 2023, and were observed in all provinces in mainland China except Tibet. Chinas decision last December to end the three-year zero-COVID policy, which included mass-testing and stringent and persistent quarantine lockdowns, led to a massive surge in hospitalisations and deaths that health experts say were largely unreported by the government. The study, published on Thursday in JAMA Network Open, said the number of excess deaths far exceeded official Chinese government estimates in January that 60,000 people with COVID-19 had died in hospital since the zero-COVID policy was abandoned a month earlier. In the study, researchers performed statistical analysis using information from published obituaries and data from searches on Baidu, a popular Chinese internet search engine. Our study of excess deaths related to the lifting of the zero-COVID policy in China sets an empirically derived benchmark estimate. These findings are important for understanding how the sudden propagation of COVID-19 across a population may impact population mortality, researchers wrote. Chinas National Health Commission did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the report. Global health experts repeatedly called on China to reveal more data as reports of rising hospitalisations and deaths started to surface, and especially as the threat of new variants became a concern. China stopped reporting official daily death results at the end of 2022. The World Health Organization says there have been 121,628 COVID deaths in China, out of a total global toll of almost 7 million. In a rare move, one Chinese province briefly published data on its website in July showing cremations jumped 70 in the first quarter of this year that was later taken down. In February, Chinas top leaders declared a decisive victory over COVID. But the virus is still making its rounds in the country and on Thursday, Beijing health officials said COVID is still the number one infectious disease in the capital, according to Chinese state media. Officials cited a new Omicron variant, called EG.5 or Eris nicknamed after the Greek Goddess of strife and discord, as the current dominant strain across China. The National Bureau of Disease Control and Prevention said the proportion of the new variant EG.5 increased from 0.6 in April to 71.6 in August, becoming the dominant strain in most provinces in China, the Global Times reported.

        "content": "The Court of Appeal has issued an interim order suspending an Extraordinary Gazette which halted the operations of the Sri Lanka Automobile Sports (SLAS). The interim order was issued on Tuesday (22 Aug), the SLAS said in a press release issued today (25 Aug). Accordingly, as per the relevant interim order, the temporary seven-member committee which was appointed by way of the said gazette is no longer legally valid. Thus, with this order, the previous SLAS council will be back on duty, while SLAS itself will continue to remain as the governing body for motor racing in Sri Lanka. On 09 August, Minister of Sports and Youth Affairs Roshan Ranasinghe issued a gazette suspending the registration of SLAS, while a temporary seven-member committee was also appointed to oversee the functions of the association. Mahesh Gammanpila, a senior public administrative officer, was appointed as Chairman of the said committee while Major General (Retd) Indunil Ranasinghe and Pubudu Wickrama were appointed as Secretary and Treasurer, respectively. Other committee members included Rameesh Mahamur, Nishan Weerasuriya, Champika Amarasekara and Sajad Suhair.

        "title": "President reveals plans to elevate Arugam Bay into high-income tourist hub",
        "date": "August 25, 2023 06:49 pm",
        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe has announced the swift implementation of a comprehensive plan to elevate the Arugam Bay tourist zone into a highly desirable destination for both local and international tourists, with the potential to generate substantial revenue. The President emphasized the importance of meticulous planning in identifying areas that necessitate development, with the intention of executing these initiatives systematically. The President further highlighted the prospect of achieving significant income by promoting water sports such as water skiing, which holds popularity along the Arugam Bay coastline. President Ranil Wickremesinghe conveyed these remarks during a meeting held today (25) with key stakeholders in the tourism industry within the Ampara district. The gathering brought together government officials and industry professionals, aimed at addressing pertinent challenges that have emerged within the tourism sector. The President underscored that global reports predict tourism to contribute 10 of the global gross domestic product by the year 2035. He stressed that Sri Lanka should proactively prepare for this shift and highlighted the tourism sectors potential to directly address the nations financial challenges. President Ranil Wickremesinghe also outlined a two-phase development plan for the tourism industry in the Eastern Province, with the ambitious goal of completing it within the next decade. Furthermore, during his ongoing tour of the Eastern Province, President Ranil Wickremesinghe conducted an inspection of Arugam Bay and Peanut Farm beaches in the Ampara district this morning (25). The President personally assessed the areas shortcomings and engaged in cordial conversations with the tourists present there. Following the site visit, President Wickremesinghe engaged in discussions with the local business community to gain insights into the challenges faced within the tourism sector in the area. This comprehensive engagement reflects the Presidents commitment to actively addressing the needs and potential of the Eastern Provinces tourism industry. In the process of developing the Arugam Bay Coastline into a prominent tourist destination, a proposal was put forth to relocate the existing fishing port to an alternative location, equipped with necessary facilities for fishermen. This proposal was conveyed to the President by Member of Parliament Mr. W.D. Weerasinghe. In response, the President emphasized the urgency of transforming this region into a dedicated tourism area while taking swift action on the proposal. Furthermore, the Presidents attention was drawn to the challenges arising from the absence of permanent property deeds for business premises within the local tourism industry. President Ranil Wickremesinghe stressed the importance of promptly submitting a comprehensive report detailing these issues, with an expectation for viable solutions to be presented. Another key concern addressed was the availability of drinking water for both business establishments and visiting tourists in the area. Recognizing that the construction of the proposed Hada Oya drinking water project might take several more years, President Wickremesinghe directed officials to explore the installation of establishing water treatment plants at existing natural water sources, with assistance from the Navy to address these multifaceted challenges in the pursuit of transforming Arugam Bay as a premier tourist destination while ensuring the well-being of the local community and visiting tourists. President Ranil Wickremesinghe emphasized the following points: Reflecting on the previous year, our nation faced an economic collapse that led us into a state of indebtedness. Thanks to well-executed government initiatives, we managed to avert bankruptcy this year, but the responsibility of repaying these debts remains. Additionally, foreign exchange is pivotal for propelling the countrys progress. Hence, maintaining a favourable trade balance is imperative; otherwise, we risk encountering another economic crisis in a decade due to escalating debt. To counter this potential scenario, we have devised a novel program. Notably, substantial focus has been directed towards the Eastern Province, with a particular emphasis on the Trincomalee districts development. In this endeavour, we have secured support from India for advancing the Trincomalee district. Our plan encompasses harnessing the land portion of the left bank of the Mahaweli zone to facilitate development activities. This includes the establishment of a sizable investment zone spanning approximately a thousand acres. Its crucial to highlight that, concurrent with the tourism industrys advancement, an agricultural modernization scheme and a development project for the fishing industry are being formulated to elevate these industries prospects. Moreover, a primary objective is to enhance the living standards of the Ampara districts people, a region inhabited by economically disadvantaged individuals. This has been a key focus, driving the modernization of both the fishing and agricultural sectors in Ampara. The target of achieving a rice yield of at least 7 to 8 metric tons per hectare is set, with corresponding initiatives in animal husbandry being enacted in the province as well. In the forthcoming decade, a concerted effort is being directed towards elevating the annual tourist influx from 2.5 million to 5 million initially, followed by a subsequent surge to 10 million visitors. Global projections underscore that by 2035, a significant 10 of the global GDP will be attributed to the tourism sector. Hence, nations must take heed of their contribution to this economic trend. In line with this, a robust initiative seeks to attract no less than 10-20 million tourists annually to this region. The formulation of a comprehensive strategy to levy fees of 300 or 500 per day per tourist is in progress, aimed at materializing this goal within the Eastern Province. Presently, the landscape of tourism exhibits distinctive features. A segment of tourists gravitates towards these provinces. Nurturing activities such as water skiing, which holds substantial tourist allure, becomes pivotal. The complete transformation of this entire region into a dedicated tourist hub is a primary objective. Concurrently, the urban and rural development endeavours must continue to advance. It is imperative to distinguish between the advancement of tourism and the enhancement of peoples livelihoods. A pivotal focus is directed towards the enhancement of the Ampara bus stand. Strategic arrangements must be crafted to facilitate tourists multi-day visits to the Ampara district. Furthermore, a holistic approach should be adopted to render the entire country an enticing destination for tourists. Diligent endeavours are underway to bolster revenue from the burgeoning tourism sector. Member of Parliament Mr. W.D. Weerasinghe, Discussing the issue of the fishing pier located at the entrance to Arugam Bay beach, an enduring historical concern has been raised. Its noteworthy that as far back as 1987, the late President Mr. J.R. Jayawardena also deliberated on the potential removal of this structure. However, despite these considerations, the effort to address this matter, unfortunately, did not materialize. Additionally, swift resolutions are sought for the challenges faced by individuals engaged in the tourism sector. In this context, the Honourable President Wickremesinghe convened a comprehensive discussion today involving officials from various institutions, including the Ministry of Environment, Department of Coastal Conservation, Department of Forest Conservation, and Department of Wildlife. We hold confidence in the Presidents expert understanding of these complexities, and we anticipate the provision of appropriate solutions to these issues. Member of Parliament Mr. S.M.M Musharraf, In the current discussion, I wish to emphasize that a comprehensive breakdown of President Wickremesinghes developmental vision for the area is superfluous. His profound understanding of these intricacies has become apparent, particularly following his first-hand exploration of Arugam Bay and Peanut Farm earlier today. As the President continues to lead the nations development agenda, it becomes evident that his stewardship might need to extend over a prolonged period, possibly spanning 10 to 15 years. We steadfastly believe that successful development frequently hinges on the willingness to make difficult choices. The President is now actively implementing these crucial strategies and plans. Member of Parliament Mr A.L.M. Ataullah, Our nation is graced with a wealth of historical heritage and natural magnificence that transcends provincial boundaries. Every region contributes its unique intrinsic value, endowed with distinct resources. Hence, the Eastern Province possesses the potential to significantly bolster the countrys economic foundation. It is essential to acknowledge the profound value of our nation. By crafting solutions for its challenges and crafting policy decisions, we can navigate the path toward exceptional progress. We repose our trust in the Presidents seasoned political intelligence to lead this charge. Preserving antiquities as a shared heritage, encompassing all individuals born within this nation, is paramount. Equally, safeguarding the forest ecosystem necessitates a meticulous, well-devised strategy. The event was attended by Senior Advisor to the President on National Security and Chief of Presidential Staff, Sagala Ratnayaka Eastern Province Governor Senthil Thondaman, and other officials.",

        "title": "Canada considers foreign student cap over housing crisis",
        "date": "August 25, 2023 07:40 pm",
        "content": "This week, Canadian Housing Minister Sean Fraser floated the idea of capping how many students Canada lets in from abroad as a way to help tackle the countrys inflated housing costs. He said it was one of the options that we ought to consider. His remarks come as Prime Minister Justin Trudeau faces growing criticism for failing to solve the housing crisis. The reaction to Mr Frasers remarks was swift, with the idea criticised by universities, as well as the province of Quebec, who says it would reject efforts to limit international students. Canada accepted a record number of international students in 2022 - more than 800,000, a 75 increase from five years ago. On the heels of Mr Frasers remarks, Immigration Minister Marc Miller said Canada would also take a look at its immigration targets to see whether it has an impact on the housing crunch. Canada has promised to welcome 1.5 million new immigrants by 2025 - but questions are growing about how to accept newcomers at that pace if there is nowhere to house them. But experts say limiting new arrivals will do little to address the problem. Just how bad is Canadas housing market? For many in Canada, the struggle to pay their mortgage or rent is a persistent reality. The average home price in Canada was around C750,000 (550,000;435,000) as of August. That represents an increase of 360 from the year 2000, when the average was C163,000. The issue is especially acute in large cities like Toronto, where a six-figure annual income is needed to afford a house. Houses now typically sell for more than C1m in Toronto and Vancouver. Both are often ranked among the worlds top 10 most unaffordable places to live in, according to the Dermographia International Housing Affordability Index, ranking alongside cities like Hong Kong and San Francisco. Rent is also becoming more expensive in Canadas major cities. The average rent for a one-bedroom apartment in Toronto is C2,500 - a 25 increase from last year. In recent years, those living in smaller cities across Canada have begun to feel the crunch, too. It is a long-standing national problem, and one that politicians from all levels of government have repeatedly promised to fix over the last decade. One cause is a housing shortage, as population growth - largely fuelled by immigration - outpaces the number of homes being built. Canada needs to build 5.8 million new homes, including two million rental units, by 2030 to solve the problem, according to the countrys national housing agency. That is about 828,000 new homes a year - more than three times the 260,000 homes built in 2022. Will a cap on international students help? In recent years, the government has tried different measures to address the issue. This includes putting a ban on foreign property ownership as of January in a bid to reduce competitiveness in the market. Paul Kershaw, a public policy professor and founder of a housing think tank, said that while foreign ownership and a growing population play a role in Canadas housing problems, putting the blame solely on those factors is looking for the easy villain. They are easy targets because it lets the rest of us and Canada think were not entangled in this issue, and we are, he said. Prof Kershaw pointed out that current homeowners benefit financially from rising property values, fuelling a culture of inequality around who owns and who doesnt. The real estate industry - including the buying, selling, and renting of units - makes up the largest share of Canadas overall GDP at 13, according to 2020 figures by Statistics Canada. This means the sector is a large driver for economic growth and a lucrative investment opportunity for those able to participate. Prof Kershaw said he believes things are unlikely to change until Canadians begin to view housing as homes first and investment second. Source - BBC - Agencies",

        "date": "August 25, 2023 10:06 pm",
        "content": "The State Minister of Women and Child Affairs Mrs. Geetha Kumarasinghe emphasized that steps will be taken to provide formal training for pre-school teachers in order to boost early childhood development. The state minister also pointed out that the government has focused on providing a salary for pre-school teachers as well. These statements were made by the State Minister of Women and Child Affairs, Mrs. Geetha Kumarasinghe, during her participation in a press conference at the Presidential Media Centre (PMC) today (25) under the theme Collective Path to a stable country. State Minister of Women and Child Affairs Geetha Kumarasinghe further said; The government has paid more attention to the health of the children. Also, efforts are being made to raise the nutritional status of children. The government has already taken steps to launch a special nutrition program for children diagnosed with malnutrition. The government is also working to provide money to low-income families suffering from malnutrition to enable them to get nutritious meals. Arrangements have been made to provide financial assistance to identified families through the divisional secretaries located throughout the island. Running pre-schools should be subject to certain regulations. The initial mental state of children is created by preschools. No one cares much about early childhood. That is why the government has decided to provide formal training to pre-school teachers. As in countries like Japan and Switzerland, the training level of preschool teachers should be brought to a higher level. It is also necessary to send them to such countries and provide them with proper training. When starting a pre-school, it should be done under a legal framework. The pre-school teacher should be a graduate. They require their own specialized training. Some preschools have teaching assistants. Maybe that assistant was someone who had appeared for the regular exam. They have the experience of working with the head teacher for a long time. Therefore, we are negotiating with the Ministry of Education to provide them with good training as well as a salary. The mind of the teacher should be right. It also helps to increase the development of early childhood. Some mothers leave their newborn babies on the streets. In other instances, they are killed. Do not do that. Give them to us. It is difficult to establish new child care centres based on the current economic situation. But attention is being paid to a system of taking care of children by creating separate places in government hospitals. Discussions are underway with the Ministry of Justice and the Ministry of Health in this regard. Violence against women and child abuse in this country has risen to an alarming level. It has been suggested to conduct awareness programs on child abuse at the school level. When a schoolgirl or child is sexually assaulted, she hesitates to tell her parents. Maybe they will prefer to tell it to her best friend whom she trusts more. Therefore, schoolchildren should be consulted by programs on how to deal with this matter. There are loopholes in the law regarding the abuse of women and children. Some women do not want to report such incidents to the police when they get abused. They feel ashamed when they go to present the complaint in public. In that regard, separate cubicles and women police officers have been deployed in every police station. Therefore, special attention and protection should be given to dealing with such women. Also, regarding the victimized women, the media should focus on acting under self-discipline in such a way that no one is prejudiced. The previous program of providing nutritional support for pregnant mothers is being continued. Arrangements have been made to provide nutritional support to mothers registered in government maternity clinics. For this year alone, the government has allocated Rs. 11 million to provide nutritional support to pregnant mothers.",

        "date": "August 26, 2023 07:49 am",
        "content": "The Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) has issued an Order reducing the interest rates on lending products of all licensed commercial banks (LCBs) and licensed specialized banks (LSBs) with effect from August 25 (Friday). Accordingly, the interest rates on pawning facilities, pre-arranged temporary overdrafts, credit card advances, and new and existing Sri Lankan Rupee (LKR)-denominated lending products are also reduced adequately. This was mentioned in the Order issued by the CBSL on the maximum interest rates on LKR-denominated lending products issued on Friday. In the recent past, the CBSL adopted several policy measures such as reduction of policy interest rates and the statutory reserve ratio, thereby facilitating a reduction in market interest rates. Yet, despite the considerable easing of monetary conditions, the CBSL said interest rates on lending products of certain financial institutions continued to remain excessive and are not in line with the current monetary policy stance, posing challenges for individuals and businesses. Accordingly, the CBSLs Monetary Board issued an Order on the interest rates applicable on LKR-denominated lending products of licensed banks, directing them to reduce interest rate on pawning facilities to 18 per annum, pre-arranged temporary overdrafts to 23 per annum and credit card advances to 28 per annum commencing the next billing cycle. The CBSL has directed all licensed banks to reduce the annual nominal interest rates applicable for all new and existing LKR-denominated lending products, excluding credit card facilities mentioned above and any other categories of lending products by at least 250 points by October 31, 2023 and further 100 basis points by December 31, 2023 in comparison to the interest rates that prevailed as at July 31, 2023. However, if the annual nominal interest rate applicable to any LKR-denominated lending products as at August 25, or anytime thereafter is 13.5 or lower, the CBSL said it is not mandatory to give effect to the reduction required in the Order. Further, in the cases where the applicable annual nominal interest rate as at the date of this Order or any time thereafter is 13.5 or less, the licensed banks are not supposed to increase the interest rates of such lending products from the level maintained as at August 25. In addition, all licensed banks are instructed to reduce the penal interest rates charged on all lending products, including credit card facilities already granted, to a level not exceeding 200 basis points per annum, for the amount in excess of an approved limit or in arrears, during the overdue period, with immediate effect.

        "content": "At least 13 people, including seven children, were killed on Friday in a crowd stampede at a stadium in Madagascars capital Antananarivo, according to the Red Cross and a local member of parliament. So far 13 people have been killed and 107 injured, said opposition MP Hanitra Razafimanantsoa on a local radio station. The Red Cross, who were on the scene, added: We dont yet have the final list. Seven minors died. The prime minister of the Indian Ocean nation Christian Ntsay had initially put the toll at 12 dead and some 80 injured. The stampede occurred at the entrance to the Barea stadium where a crowd of around 50,000 spectators had arrived to attend the opening ceremony of the Indian Ocean Island Games. The cause of the tragedy was not immediately known but the Red Cross said the death toll could climb. There were a lot of people at the entrance, which triggered a stampede, Antsa Mirado, a communications manager with the Red Cross, told Agence France-Presse. Madagascar President Andry Rajoelina, who was present at the opening ceremony, called for a minutes silence. A tragic event occurred because there was pushing. There were injuries and deaths at the entrance, he said in a televised speech. Television images broadcast images of dazed and shocked people trying to locate their shoes piled among objects lost in the deadly crush. Other images from inside the stadium, shared on social media, showed the stands packed with spectators. The Indian Ocean Island Games are a multidisciplinary competition being held in Madagascar until September 3. They have been staged every four years in different islands in the southwest Indian Ocean for around 40 years. The previous edition took place in Mauritius.

        "content": "Offshore Wind Road Map for Sri Lanka was launched on Friday (Aug. 25), which provides a strategic analysis of the offshore wind development potential in the country, considering the opportunities and challenges under different offshore wind growth scenarios. It is intended to provide evidence to support the Government of Sri Lanka in establishing policies, regulations, processes, and infrastructure to successfully deploy offshore wind. The roadmap report was initiated by the World Bank Group under its Offshore Wind Development Program. In a post on X (formerly known as Twitter), Power  Energy Minister Kanchana Wijesekera said the roadmap was launched with the financial and technical assistance of the World Bank, International Finance Corporation (IFC), Energy Sector Management Assistance Program (ESMAP) and PROBLUE  World Banks blue economy program. The lawmaker said utilizing Sri Lankas immense potential of offshore wind will be vital in achieving net zero targets, renewable energy targets and energy exports. UK High Commissioner to Sri Lanka and members of the High Commission, Country Heads and representatives of the World Bank, IFC  officials of state institutes participated in the main event at the Power  Energy Ministry. The World Bank, with regard to the rationale for offshore wind in Sri Lanka, says the island nation has good natural conditions for offshore wind and there is already private sector interest in developing projects. Sri Lanka has an opportunity to use this domestic renewable energy resource as part of its transition to net-zero carbon and to help reduce the economic burden from fossil fuel imports. The Sri Lankan government has set a goal to have 70 of its electricity generated by renewable energy sources by 2030, and achieve carbon neutrality in electricity generation by 2050. A currently untapped resource for the country that can help achieve these goals is offshore wind. Offshore Wind Roadmap for Sri Lanka by Adaderana Online on Scribd",

        "date": "August 26, 2023 12:42 pm",
        "content": "The two main suspects in the murder of a man in Dodangoda have been arrested by the Kalutara Division Crimes Unit. A 37-year-old named Dimuth Chamika was found hacked to death inside a house in Dolelanda area of Dodangoda, Kalutara in the early hours of August 14. The father-of-one was had reportedly been murdered while staying at his wifes parents house, due to ongoing repairs at their own residence in Dolelanda. A group of assailants had broken into the house, and attacked the deceased with sharp weapons, leaving him seriously wounded. He was pronounced dead after being admitted to the Nagoda Teaching Hospital in Kalutara. Motive behind the murder was ascertained as a narcotics-related dispute with an ill-famed drug dealer in Matugama. The deceased had been a close associate of the said drug dealer, however, after their relationship began to go south nearly a year ago, Dimuth, along with several others, had attacked the drug dealers associates after breaking into his house. Swinging into action, several police units initiated investigations to apprehend the suspects who were still on the loose. Acting on a tip-off received by the OIC of Kalutara Division Crimes Unit, the two main suspects complicit in the murder were thus arrested. The arrestees, who are residents of Dodangoda, were identified as Buddhika Wijesiri alias Maltiya (38) and Vimukthi Madhusanka alias Kalu Gayan (29). According to the police, the duo has previously been charged with murder, theft, breaking and entering, and possession of illegal weapons. They are reportedly associates of the drug dealer operating in Matugama.",

        "date": "August 26, 2023 01:36 pm",
        "content": "Outgoing Sri Lankan High Commissioner to India, Milinda Moragoda, paying a farewell call on Indian Minister of Road Transport  Highways Nitin Gadkari, has discussed cooperation in promoting alternatives to fossil fuels such as electricity and bio-fuels in the transport sector. Moragoda called on Minister Gadkari on 24 August in New Delhi. The alternatives to fossil fuels were seen as highly cost-effective and environment friendly, suitable to a country like Sri Lanka, the Sri Lankan High Commission in New Delhi said in a statement. The Indian minister spoke on his countrys experience in alternative fuels and expressed his willingness to share the relevant expertise with Sri Lanka. At the outset, High Commissioner Moragoda thanked the Indian Road Transport and Highways Minister for the cooperation that the latter extended to him during his tenure in New Delhi. He also apprised the Minister of the references to connectivity, particularly those that are on road connectivity, in the Indo-Lanka joint document Promoting Connectivity, Catalysing Prosperity: India-Sri Lanka Economic Partnership Vision, which was issued following bilateral talks between the President of Sri Lanka and the Prime Minister of India in July. The two sides discussed ways and means through which the connectivity goals stipulated in the joint Vision document could be materialized. High Commissioner Moragoda invited Minister Gadkari to visit Sri Lanka at a mutually convenient time, which the Minister accepted. The Sri Lanka envoy also presented to Minister Gadkari a stone obtained from the stream flowing besides the Seetha Amman Temple in Seetha Eliya (Ashoka Vatika) in Sri Lanka, which is believed to be the site where Seetha was held captive according to the Ramayana.",

        "title": "Dune: Part Two delayed until 2024 due to ongoing Hollywood strikes",
        "date": "August 26, 2023 02:28 pm",
        "content": "Warner Bros has delayed the planned November release of its big-budget Dune sequel until March 2024. A spokesperson said the movie would not be released whilst the Hollywood actors strike was ongoing because its stars cannot promote the movie. Dune: Part Two, starring Timothee Chalamet and Zendaya, was one of the most anticipated films of 2023. The new release date means the movie is now out of contention for awards season early next year. Dune: Part Two is a sci-fi sequel based on Frank Herberts 1965 novel about the adventures of mythic hero named Paul Atreides. Alongside Chalamet and Zendaya, the franchises also stars Rebecca Ferguson, Josh Brolin and Stellan Skarsgard. The first movie in the franchise was a resounding critical success and with a star studded cast including the additions of Florence Pugh, Austin Butler an Christopher Walken, fans anticipations for Dune: Part Two could not be higher. But Warner Bros have said with the stars currently striking and unavailable to promote the film, it is reluctant to release it as scheduled for fear of missing out on financial gains. Since the strikes began, there have been a number of lacklustre opening weekends for movies because of the promotional ban. Warner Bros superhero movie Blue Beetle opened with 25m (19.8m), a relatively low figure the studio will be eager not to repeat given the large scale investment in Dune. The shift in the Warner Brothers release schedule has also caused a delay to other releases, with the studio also announcing today that its delaying Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire from 15 March to 12 April 2024. With the first Dune movie amassing over 400m (317m) at the box office worldwide, the delay to the second instalment will come as a blow to cinema chains still trying to recover from the Covid pandemic. Hollywood strikes continue The members of the Writers Guild of America have been striking for several months, fighting for a better deal with Hollywoods studios in the streaming age. In July, thousands of Hollywood actors from union SAG-AFTRA joined the strike, appearing at picket lines after last-ditch talks between their union and major studios broke down around a major deadline. The beginning of the strikes saw the cast of Oppenheimer walk out of the movies premiere in solidarity with their industry colleagues. Since then, appearances and interviews with the press have been few and far between, with the pause in production having a knock on effect in the industry. A number of studios have already announced delays to projects amid the ongoing strikes and there is expected to be more to come. Originally slated for release in March 2024, Spider-Man: Beyond the Spider-Verse has been delayed indefinitely by Sony, while Disney has also announced a reshuffle of its upcoming Star Wars, Marvel and Avatar films. Awards season without Dune In 2021 Denis Villeneuves first Dune film received 10 Oscar nominations, eventually walking away with six wins on the night in the technical categories of production design, cinematography, film editing, sound, visual effects and original score. Following the previous success and early buzz around the second instalment, the expectation is the movie would be very competitive those same categories and more. However, the Oscars submission deadline for general categories is 18 November 2023, with preliminary shortlist voting and results announced in December. The voting period will then run from 11-16 January 2024, with the official nominations announcement on 23 January. This leaves Dune: Part Two firmly out of the race and the team behind the film will have to wait until 2025 to compete. The absence of Dune may come as welcome news to other award contenders such as Greta Gerwigs Barbie and Christopher Nolans Oppenheimer, both tipped for accolades next year after their box office successes this summer. With the strikes continuing into the autumn, Dune: Part Two may not be the only contender missing come awards season, as the film industry continues to see and feel the knock on effects.

        "title": "Belarusian leader Lukashenko says he warned Wagner chiefs to watch out",
        "date": "August 26, 2023 04:06 pm",
        "content": "Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko said that he warned Russias Wagner mercenary chiefs Yevgeny Prigozhin and Dmitry Utkin to watch out for possible threats to their lives, and insisted that Wagner fighters would remain in Belarus following the apparent deaths of their leaders in a plane crash. Lukashenko, who helped broker the deal that saw Wagner fighters retreat peacefully to Belarus following their aborted rebellion in June, said at the time that he had persuaded Putin not to wipe out Prigozhin and his mercenary force. Commenting on Prigozhins apparent death in a plane crash in Russia this week, Lukashenko said on Friday that the Wagner boss had twice dismissed concerns raised about possible threats to his life. Lukashenko said that during the mutiny, he had warned Prigozhin that he would die if he continued to march on Moscow, to which he said Prigozhin had answered: To hell with it  I will die. Then, Lukashenko said, when Prigozhin and Utkin, who helped found Wagner and was also listed as a passenger on the plane that crashed, had come to see him, he had warned them both: Lads  you watch out. It was not exactly clear from Lukashenkos warnings, which were reported by Belarusian state news agency BelTA, when that conversation took place with the Wagner leaders. Lukashenko, both an old acquaintance of Prigozhin and a close ally of Russia, said he believed that Putin had nothing to do with the plane crash. I know Putin: He is calculating, very calm, even tardy, Lukashenko said. I cannot imagine that Putin did it, that Putin is to blame. Its just too rough and unprofessional a job, he said. The Kremlin said on Friday that Western suggestions that Prigozhin had been killed on its orders were an absolute lie, while also declining to definitively confirm the Wagner chiefs death, citing the need to wait for test results. Lukashenko also said that Wagner fighters would remain in Belarus. Wager lived, Wagner is living and Wagner will live in Belarus, Lukashenko said. As long as we need this unit, they will live and work with us, he said. Washington, DC-based think tank, the Institute for the Study of War (ISW), said that Lukashenkos comments on Prigozhin and the deal he struck to end the Wagner rebellion in Russia in June, as well as Putins innocence in the Wagner chiefs apparent deaths, were to bolster his image with his domestic audience. Lukashenko has routinely attempted to portray himself as a sovereign leader despite Russias current de facto occupation of the country Belarus, and he likely hopes to prevent his domestic audience from viewing Putins almost certain assassination of Prigozhin as the Kremlins unilateral cancellation of agreements that he Lukashenko had made with Wagner, the ISW said. Lukashenko likely hoped to underscore the initial deal, and Wagners arrival in Belarus as examples of his ability to make high-level security decisions outside of the Kremlins dictates, the ISW added.

        "content": "If the prevailing arid weather continues to prevail, the available water levels in reservoirs will be sufficient only for another 4 weeks, the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) says. According to the state-owned utility, hydroelectricity generation capacity has gone down by 15. The CEB further mentioned that electricity is provided without interruption at present owing to thermal power generation. It is reported that the water capacity of Samanalawewa reservoir has dropped to 1, Castlereagh reservoirs to 21, Maussakelle reservoirs to 35 and Victoria reservoirs to 25. Accordingly, only 300 gigawatt-hours of hydropower can be generated in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, total gross electricity generation from thermal power plants has been increased to 65. In addition, about 11 of electricity generation capacity has been added to the national system through the use of solar and wind power. The Disaster Management Centre (DMC) said the number of people affected by the prevailing extreme dry weather has soared to 291,720. The Northern Province remains the hardest hit by the drought, as 75,607 people from 23,688 families are affected.
