The Bribery Commission had lodged the case before Colombo Magistrates Court against Johnston Fernando, former CWE chairman Eraj Fernando and former CWE Working Director Mohamed Shakeer, for allegedly using 153 employees of Lanka Sathosa in political activities while serving as a minister between 2010 and 2014 and incurring a loss to the tune of Rs 40 million to the government.

        "title": "Catastrophic Italy floods leave 13 dead, force 13,000 from their homes",
        "date": "May 19, 2023 12:43 pm",
        "content": "More than 20 rivers have burst their banks in Italy, leaving 13 people dead and forcing thousands from their homes after six months rainfall fell in a day and a half. More bodies were found on Thursday after almost every river flooded between Bologna and the north-east coast 115km (70 miles) away. Some 280 landslides have taken place. The mayor of Ravenna, a city badly affected by flooding, told the BBC it was the worst disaster in a century. Michele de Pascale described the damage caused by the floods as catastrophic, costing people in his city and the wider region their homes, possessions and for some, their lives. It was a very bad 48 hours. Water and mud took over our whole village, said Roberta Lazzarini, 71. Her home of Botteghino di Zocca, south of Bologna, was hit by a torrent on Wednesday. Streets, houses and gardens were inundated and Roberta said she was still scared. Ive never seen anything like that here. We were stuck and didnt know what to do. I just hope it doesnt happen again. Firefighters helped residents flee their houses, including a 97-year-old woman who had to leave her bedroom in a rubber dinghy. Our community is broken, said Robertas daughter, Ines, who runs the local cafe in the central square. We felt completely cut out, isolated, some of us were truly terrified. Weve had floods before, but it has never been this bad as far as I can remember, said Lamieri, 74, as he removed mud from his basement, where his son stores products to sell at the souvenir shop he runs in central Bologna. The street turned into river. We lost all of our stuff which was stored down here. We estimate thousands of euros in damage. This is one of many villages and towns flooded in the province of Emilia-Romagna, not just from rivers, but overflowing canals too. More evacuations took place west of Ravenna on Thursday and more bodies were found, including a couple in a flat in the village of Russi, which was flooded hours before. Many are warning that Italy needs a national plan to respond to the effects of climate change. Civil Protection Minister Nello Musumeci said tropical conditions had already reached Italy, with 20cm of rain falling in 36 hours, and in some areas up to 50cm. Soils that remain dry for a long time end up becoming cemented, drastically limiting their capacity to absorb water, he said. No regional dams had been built for 40 years, he said, and a new approach to hydraulic engineering engineering was needed. Prime Minister Giorgia Melonis government has called a crisis meeting next Tuesday. The leader of Italys opposition Democratic Party told the BBC the whole political system was to blame for the disaster and politicians had not done enough to address challenges posed by climate change. Elly Schlein, who was formerly vice-president of Emilia-Romagna, said successive governments had consistently failed to address Italys vulnerability to flooding and other extreme water events like droughts. Many factors contribute to flooding, but a warming atmosphere caused by climate change makes extreme rainfall more likely. Already, the world has warmed about 1.1C since the industrial era began, and temperatures will continue to rise unless governments around the world make steep cuts to emissions. Antonio Francesco Rizzuto, a 55-year-old lawyer who lives by the river with his wife, was forced to leave on Tuesday night and is now living at his daughters in a nearby village. It was something no-one was expecting in these proportions, he said. Before we left our house, the water level was getting higher by the minute. When we got back yesterday... our living room was completely submerged. We will have to throw away most of our furniture. Stefano Bonaccini, regional president of the Emilia-Romagna region, said the damage costs ran into billions of euros. Overnight, evacuations were ordered in towns to the west of Ravenna. Residents in Villanova were ordered to seek shelter on upper floors, a day after floodwater cascaded through the historic centre of Lugo. Lugo was flooded again on Thursday, as was Cervi, on the coast. This weekends Emilia-Romagna Grand Prix at Imola was called off because of the risk of the nearby Santerno river flooding. Many of the areas around the track used for parking and watching the race were deluged on Tuesday. As well as the 23 rivers that burst their banks, the Zena stream turned into a raging torrent in Botteghino di Zocca. Lino Lenzi, 80, was standing in what used to be his daughters garden, which was now overflowing with mud, his grandchildrens toys submerged. Ive lived here for 70 years and Ive never seen anything like this, he said, the water is everywhere. The house has belonged to the family for generations and his daughter had just finished renovating it. Inside his kitchen, the water is is up to our ankles. The day before, it was more than 2m (6.5ft) high. Weve had to get rid of the water with everything weve got: buckets, pots and pans. Lino complained the local rivers had not been dredged for years. No-one has showed up to help. Weve received zero help from the government or local authority, Rescue operations have proved difficult because so many roads have been flooded and many towns have gone without electricity. The only help Lino had was from a teenage boy who lives near by. He walked past and saw that we needed help. He helped us move our furniture. Source: BBC -Agencies",

In his petition, the SDIG had called for a court order preventing the hearing of the private complaint filed against him before the Colombo Fort Magistrates Court. The petition was heard before the President of the Court of Appeal Justice Nissanka Bandula Karunaratne and Justice A. Marikkar. Appearing on behalf of the SDIG, Presidents Counsel Romesh de Silva highlighted that the summons issued by the Colombo Fort Magistrates Court ordering his client to appear before the court in relation to the private complaint filed was, in fact, against the law. Meanwhile, Senior State Counsel Shaminda Wickrema, who appeared on behalf of the Colombo Fort Magistrate, named as a respondent in Tennakoons petition, informed the court that a motion has already been filed requesting that his client be given more time to file objections. The Appellate Court bench, however, informed the respondents legal counsel that the said motion has already been rejected. Thus, the further hearing of SDIG Tennakoons petition was thereby adjourned until 22 May.

More than Rs. 17.8 million was recovered, in cash, from the Presidents House after anti-government protesters stormed into the compounds during mass demonstrations. The funds were later handed over to the Fort Police, after which the Colombo Fort Magistrate called for a report on the investigation into the matter owing to certain discrepancies.",

        "content": "The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has unreservedly rejected the recent statement issued by the Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau pertaining to Sri Lankas civil war. On 18 May 2023, Trudeau issued a statement containing outrageous claims of genocide relating to the past conflict in Sri Lanka, to which the island nations Foreign Ministry responded saying such irresponsible statements made by the leader of a nation breeds disharmony in both countries, as opposed to promoting peace. Issuing a statement in this regard, the Ministry urged Canada and its leaders to refrain from making pronouncements from Canada which promote hatred, misinformation and extremist views, and to cease its unhelpful focus on Sri Lanka based on distorted facts. This runs contrary to the Canadian Prime Ministers stated objective of safeguarding human rights across the world, the statement read. Below is the full statement issued by the Sri Lankan Ministry of Foreign Affairs: The Ministry of Foreign Affairs unreservedly rejects the statement issued by the Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on 18 May 2023 containing outrageous claims of genocide relating to the past conflict in Sri Lanka. Such irresponsible and polarizing pronouncements by the leader of a nation breeds disharmony and hatred both in Canada and Sri Lanka, instead of promoting peace and reconciliation. Sri Lanka urges Canada and its leaders to refrain from making pronouncements from Canada which promote hatred, misinformation and extremist views and to cease its unhelpful focus on Sri Lanka based on distorted facts. This runs contrary to the Canadian Prime Ministers stated objective of safeguarding human rights across the world. Sri Lanka vehemently rejects this unsubstantiated narrative of genocide which has been deliberately constructed by politically motivated anti-Sri Lanka elements whose so-called recognition in Canada depends on spreading misinformation and a false narrative of hatred. We urge caution at a time when the world is combatting the dangers of misinformation, including through social media platforms. For over three decades the people of Sri Lanka suffered from the brutal terrorism waged by the LTTE one of the worlds most ruthless terrorist organizations which suppressed the lives and democratic rights of all communities, Tamils, Muslims and Sinhalese in all parts of the country. The LTTE atrocities included assassinations of Sri Lankan and foreign leaders as well as moderate Tamil leaders. The defeat of this terrorist organization brought security and stability to Sri Lanka. The LTTE continues to be proscribed in several democratic countries including Canada. Many Sri Lankan soldiers were killed and disabled in protecting the sovereignty, unity and territorial integrity of the country. Sri Lanka and Canada are linked by a significant community of Canadians of Sri Lankan heritage who maintain a rich and mutually reinforcing relationship between our countries. We urge the Canadian Government and its leaders to leverage this platform to form bonds of friendship and harmony between people and to refrain from polarizing communities in both Canada and overseas. Despite the socio-economic challenges encountered by the country at present, Sri Lanka has made a cautious start in ushering in stability, recovery and furthering reconciliation for all communities and all segments of the people. We deeply appreciate the support we have received from the international community in this effort. Both Sri Lanka and Canada are committed to common democratic values, institutions and traditions and to the promotion of peace and prosperity to improve the lives of fellow citizens. Sri Lanka wishes to engage with Canada, a longstanding bilateral and development partner, in this spirit of mutual respect and calls on Canada to ensure that its pronouncements are not detrimental to Sri Lankas overriding national interest of ensuring the prosperity of our people and future generations.",

He pointed out that it is regrettable that it is still being discussed in 2023, the President said that the program to move the country toward a digital economy should not be delayed at all and that the faster it is done, the more results can be achieved. The President formally inaugurated the Daraz Headquarters by illuminating the digital plaque after traditionally lighting the oil lamp and cutting the ribbon at the entrance to the Daraz Headquarters. He also joined an observation tour of the Daraz Headquarters and engaged in a discussion with its Board of Directors. Speaker Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena, State Minister of Technology Kanaka Herath, Managing Director of Daraz Rakhil Fernando, President Director of International Relations, Mr. Dinouk Colombage, other officials and employees from Daraz Head Office were present on this occasion. Addressing the event, President Ranil Wickremesinghe further said; I must confess that I have followed Daraz on and off on Social Media. However, many Sri Lankans, particularly the youth, will undoubtedly order and use several goods from your portal at least once in this global process. But your presence here and the growth of Daraz in Sri Lanka shows Sri Lankas potential for e-commerce and you all have shown the way. So Alibaba has to be thanked for the work for coming here and for starting Daraz in Sri Lanka. You all must be commended for expanding it so fast, as without you all this would not be possible. We are now in the age of e-commerce, but the initiation of e-commerce in our country has been slow in picking up. Actually this morning the State Minister, the Secretary and myself, together with some of our other officials discussed how we can start and accelerate this process of digitalization and how to pave the way for a digital economy. I requested them to submit a report within a month to go ahead. We have made every effort in digitalisation. I dont think we really need to reinvent the process. Because what takes place in Tamil Nadu, South India would be more than convenient for us if we can use it here. We have another advantage, if we use the same method, not only the 20 million here will be added to us but we will have a bigger scope of another 50 million. I think most of us in Sri Lanka are conversant with Tamil and English, which is making it very easy for us to work further. So lets speak with India to see whether we can get help from Tamil Nadu and use the Tamil Nadu system in Sri Lanka. So that is the first one. Let us press ahead and accelerate digitalisation in Sri Lanka. In fact, we are discussing whether it is necessary to bring in legislation which will not only lay down the format but also put the responsibility on different Government organisations and other selected private organisations. We benchmark it and ensure that they hit the benchmark. If not in the case of Government we may even have to impose some penalties by Law. Thats the only way it can be done. In some instances, its the lethargy that keeps it going, and in some instances it is basically a desire to cover up. I took the example of Revenue Administration Management Information System (RAMIS). RAMIS was discussed when I was the Prime Minister in 1993. We are still discussing it in 2023. So you can just imagine how long it has taken us to get this going. I want it and the Parliament wants it moving before the end of the year. We want to run parallel with the digital economy and green economy. Let us put these together and proceed. Asias green economy is a business. That business is worth  5 trillion. We dont want 5 trillion if we can even settle at a few billion that is more than enough. Let us now go ahead and go in for the complete digital age. Lets not hold back so I hope we will also come up with packages from next year onwards to help you. This is just the beginning and all of you here at Daraz are helping us to build that digital economy. So the digital era is here, and if you have any suggestions, please contact the State Minister.",

Sabry conveyed this when he summoned Canadian High Commissioner Eric Walsh to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Friday (May 19). Minister Sabry stated that this politically motivated statement was divisive and was issued for domestic political consumption in Canada. Sri Lanka vehemently rejects this unsubstantiated allegation of genocide relating to the countrys almost 3 decades of terrorist conflict perpetuated by the LTTE, Sabry to the Canadian envoy. He observed that the inaccurate and provocative allegations in the statement will lead to polarizing Sri Lankans at this particular juncture when the Government is working towards economic stability, peace and reconciliation for all. He emphasized that the arbitrary and erroneous use of genocide on Sri Lanka is driven by a small section of the politically motivated anti-Sri Lanka elements in the Diaspora with a separatist agenda. The Sri Lankan government, as a long-standing bilateral partner, has urged the co-operation of the Canadian Government and encourage a mutually supportive relationship between the two countries, whilst constructively engaging the community of Sri Lankan heritage in Canada to work towards realizing our common objectives of inclusive development and sustainable peace.",

        "date": "May 20, 2023 05:35 pm",
        "content": "Leaders of the Group of Seven (G7) nations on Saturday called for the development and adoption of technical standards to keep artificial intelligence (AI) trustworthy, saying governance of the technology has not kept pace with its growth. While the G7 leaders, meeting in Hiroshima, Japan, recognised that the approaches to achieving the common vision and goal of trustworthy AI may vary, they said in a statement the rules for digital technologies like AI should be in line with our shared democratic values. The agreement came after the European Union, which participates in the G7, inched closer this month to passing legislation to regulate AI technology, potentially the worlds first comprehensive AI law that could form a precedent among the advanced economies. We want AI systems to be accurate, reliable, safe and non-discriminatory, regardless of their origin, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said on Friday. The G7 leaders said they need to immediately take stock of the opportunities and challenges of generative AI, a subset of the technology popularised by the ChatGPT app. OpenAIs ChatGPT pushed Elon Musk and a group of AI experts to raise an alarm in March calling for a six-month pause in developing more powerful systems, citing potential risks to society. A month later, EU lawmakers urged world leaders to find ways to control AI technologies, saying they were developing faster than expected. The United States so far has taken a cautious approach on governing AI, with President Joe Biden last month saying it remained to be seen whether AI is dangerous. Sam Altman, CEO of Microsoft-backed (MSFT.O) OpenAI, told a Senate panel on Tuesday that the U.S. should consider licensing and testing requirements for development of AI models. Japan, this years chair of G7, has been even more accommodative, pledging support for public and industrial adoption of AI while monitoring its risks. Its important to properly deal with both the potentials and risks, Prime Minister Fumio Kishida told the governments AI council last week. The Western nations differing approaches to AI are in contrast to Chinas restrictive policy. Its cyberspace regulator in April unveiled draft measures to align generative AI-powered services with the countrys core socialist values. While acknowledging differences on how AI should be regulated, the G7 leaders agreed on Friday to create a ministerial forum dubbed the Hiroshima AI process to discuss issues around generative AI, such as copyrights and disinformation, by the end of this year. The leaders also urged international organizations such as the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development to consider analysis on the impact of policy developments. The summit followed a G7 digital ministers meeting last month, where its members - the U.S., Japan, Germany, Britain, France, Italy, Canada and the EU - said they should adopt risk-based AI rules. The EU and U.S. are also expected to exchange views on the emerging technologies at the Trade and Technology Council in Sweden on May 30-31. Source: Reuters -Agencies",

        "date": "May 20, 2023 06:24 pm",
        "content": "India will start withdrawing its highest-value currency notes from circulation, the countrys central bank said on Friday, in a move that economists said could boost bank deposits at a time of high credit growth. The withdrawal of 2,000-rupee (USD 24.5) notes - which the finance ministrys top official, T.V Somanathan, said would not cause disruption either in normal life or in the economy - also comes ahead of elections in four large states at the end of the year and a national ballot in spring 2024. Most of Indias political parties are believed to hoard cash in high denomination bills to fund election campaign expenses to get around tough spending limits imposed by the Election Commission. Announcing the withdrawal, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) said evidence showed the denomination was not being commonly used for transactions. The notes will remain legal tender, it added, but people will be asked to deposit and exchange them for smaller denominations by Sept. 30. The stock of banknotes in other denominations continues to be adequate to meet the currency requirement of the public, the RBI added in a statement. The 2,000 rupee note was introduced in 2016 after the Narendra Modi-led government abruptly withdrew 500 and 1000 rupee denominations in an effort to remove forgeries from circulation. There is little evidence that the plan succeeded, but the move did create a systemic shortage of cash by taking away 86 of the economys currency in circulation by value overnight. The government began issuing new 500-rupee notes days later, and added the 2,000 to replenish currency in circulation at a faster pace. However, since then, the central bank has focused on printing notes of 500 rupees and below and has printed no new 2,000-rupee notes in the last four years. Pronab Sen, economist and former chief statistician of India, called the withdrawal of the higher-value note a sensible form of demonetisation. Karthik Srinivasan, Senior Vice President of Financial Sector Ratings at ICRA, said banks deposit accretion rates could improve marginally in the near term. This will ease the pressure on deposit rate hikes and could also result in moderation in short-term interest rates, he added. Indian banks have been reporting double-digit credit growth in recent months, notwithstanding 250 basis points of RBI rate since last May. Banks are raising deposits at a faster pace to meet the growing demand and tightening liquidity. Source: Reuters -Agencies",

The relevant directive was given during a discussion held at the Presidential Secretariat yesterday (19 May) to formulate a policy framework for modernizing the agriculture sector, the Presidents Media Division (PMD) reported. Accordingly, the Head of State instructed the Presidents Secretary to appoint additional secretaries from the Presidents Office, Ministry of Agriculture, and other line ministries, along with officials of equivalent ranks, to serve in the Agricultural Modernization Secretariat. He emphasized the importance of involving the private sector in these activities. Wickremesinghe further highlighted that the armed forces are also contributing to the agricultural modernization program. He instructed officials to publicize the activities of the Agricultural Modernization Secretariat, which should include collaborative efforts between the public and private sectors. These activities will be based on research conducted in key areas such as tea, coconut, rubber, paddy, cinnamon, and fisheries. President Wickremesinghe suggested implementing pilot projects in the respective fields, involving officials from local government institutions and the private sector, with the guidance and technical support of the public sector. The President requested a progress report from the officials on the Agricultural Modernization Secretariat by July. Additionally, he instructed to propose appropriate solutions after submitting requests for required land to the Secretariat. President Wickremesinghe was briefed on the decisions made by the Agriculture Modernization Committee, led by Senior Professor Gamini Senanayake, on agricultural innovation projects. He emphasized the involvement of private sector academics, researchers, experienced officials, and the youth community in implementing these projects. The President stressed the need to modernize all sectors, including plantation industries, fishing, fish production, ornamental flower cultivation, vegetable and fruit production, grain production, milk, and egg production. Officials were instructed to keep the President informed about decisions made by sub-committees, chaired by Ministry Secretaries, involving the business community in relevant fields, as part of the agriculture sector modernization program, aimed at building a developed Sri Lanka by 2048. The discussion was attended by Senior Advisor to the President on National Security and Chief of Presidential Staff Sagala Ratnayake, Senior Advisor to the President on Economic Affairs Dr. R.H.S.

        "content": "Japans Nippon Ishin no Kai Upper House lawmaker Mizuho Umemura was dismissed from a parliamentary committee and party officials apologized after her remarks questioning the March 2021 death of a Sri Lankan woman at an immigration facility ignited a firestorm of criticism. Ratnayake Liyanage Wishma Sandamali, 33, died at Nagoya Regional Immigration Services Bureau after complaining to officials that she was ill and needed medical attention, sparking shock, anger, and calls from within Japan and abroad for reforms over the way detainees are treated. Video clips taken by a security camera in Wishmas room show her repeatedly pleading to immigration officials to be taken to the hospital to no avail. The woman was not eating, although in one video clip she tells officials she would if she could. But without offering proof, Umemura told the Upper House on three occasions that Wishma may have died as a result of a hunger strike, suggesting she had done so in the hope of an early release from the center due to illness. Her remarks caused an uproar, inviting criticism from other ruling and opposition party leaders. Umemura admitted to a judicial affairs committee on Tuesday that it was just speculation. On Thursday, Nippon Ishin Secretary-General Fumitake Fujita announced the party had forced Umemura to resign from the Judicial Affairs Committee and that other disciplinary actions might be taken. The fact that Umemura took up an emotional question based on her assumptions is extremely problematic and inappropriate. The partys executive committee would like to apologize, Fujita said. Immigration officials acknowledged in an August 2021 report that officials lacked an awareness of how serious Wishmas situation was. The head of the Immigration Services Agency apologized, and four officials at the Nagoya center were reprimanded. The family has filed a lawsuit against the government and is seeking 156 million in compensation. Source - The Japan Times -Agencies",

        "content": "Greece says it has recovered hundreds of looted artefacts, including a 2nd-Century bronze statue of Alexander the Great. The trove was recovered after a legal battle with the company of a British antiquities dealer, officials said. Robin Symes had amassed thousands of pieces as part of a network of illegal traders. For years, Greece has been fighting to recover looted artefacts from museums and private collections world-wide. The announcement that 351 objects from Symess collection were being repatriated after a 17-year legal battle was made by Greek Culture Minister Lina Mendoni on Friday. Ms Mendoni did not say if the artefacts were linked to the discovery by Italian and Swiss police in 2016 of a haul of archaeological treasures said to have been stored by Symes at the Geneva freeport in Switzerland. Arguably the most high-profile artworks in the debate about whether museums should return items to their countries of origin are the Parthenon Sculptures. They were removed from the Parthenon temple in Athens in the early 19th Century by the British soldier and diplomat, Lord Elgin. The sculptures were then bought by the British government in 1816 and placed in the British Museum. Talks about their return are said to be advancing. In March, the Vatican returned three fragments of Athens Parthenon temple it had kept for centuries. Source - BBC -Agencies",

Ada Derana reporter said the shooting has taken place during a raid conducted early this morning (21) at an illicit liquor brewery. The 19-year-old was shot in his leg, and a pet Rottweiler dog was shot dead while a group of officers attached to the Gampola Divisional Crimes Unit tried to inspect the house in question. Meanwhile, the residents of the house allege that the police officers had prevented the injured boy from being taken to the hospital.

They kept us inside the house with handcuffs, a relative of the injured boy said.

        "date": "May 21, 2023 12:38 pm",
        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe called on every Sri Lankan to contribute to creating a glorious and prosperous country free of bankruptcy. He mentioned this yesterday (20) while declaring open the Kegalle, Aranayaka Asupini Ella water scheme; the largest water project in the Sabaragamuwa Province. This water scheme was implemented under the financial allocation of Rs. 3,847 million from the Government of Sri Lanka and the loan support of Rs. 18,650 million from the Government of the Netherlands, providing solutions to the drinking water problem in 135 Grama Seva Divisions belonging to Aranayaka, Mawanella and Rambukkana Divisional secretariats in Kegalle district. The construction work of the water scheme commenced in 2018 and the work was done under the supervision of the National Water Supply and Drainage Board under the guidance of the Ministry of Water Supply and Estate Infrastructure Development. A water treatment plant with a capacity of 21,000 cubic meters per day, 07 service reservoirs, a transmission pipe system of 37 km and a distribution pipe system of 120 km have been constructed under this scheme. Under this project, around 169,000 people covering 52,300 families will have clean and safe drinking water facilities, under which 25,200 new water connections will be provided and 27,100 existing water connections will be improved. Unveiling the plaque and declaring open the water scheme to the people, the President also declared opened the water system. He then joined an observation tour of the water scheme premises. Mr. Ranil Wickremesinghe, who further commented, said: In 2018, I came to lay the foundation stone of this water scheme as the Prime Minister. Today, as the President, I consider it a great privilege to come to declare open that water scheme. At that time I came to lay the foundation stone for this water scheme on the request of Mr. Kabir Hashim. I am happy to be able to finish this project. The program started by Minister Kabir Hashim has been carried forward by the next Government and has been completed during the tenure of Minister Jeevan Thondaman. The drinking water requirement of about 200,000 people will be fulfilled by this water scheme which will be started today. I express my thanks to all the employees who have contributed for this water scheme. In the past, after Sri Lanka was declared a bankrupt country, no investors came to the country. Former investors left the country. In such an environment, foreign investors are not interested in providing aid to Sri Lanka. In such a situation, I have taken charge of the country and gone to the IMF to bring the countrys economy to a stable state. Because whether they are Sinhalese or Tamil, people do not wish to live as beggars. They wish to live with dignity. The IMF had imposed tough conditions on us. But we had no other options. Similar conditions were presented earlier in the negotiations with the IMF. There, one previous Government withdrew from transactions with the IMF. But we have gone to the IMF and are taking the program forward with proper management. By the coming month of September, it is possible to successfully complete the debt restructuring program and bring the economy to a stable level. We have submitted the agreement with the IMF to the Parliament and passed it. Today, members of the SLPP have expressed their will and given the necessary support to the economic policy of the United National Party. That support is very important if this country is to recover from the economic crisis. We should all work together and work hard to build a prosperous country out of bankruptcy. Minister of Water Supply and Estate Infrastructure Development Jeevan Thondaman I would like to thank you all for coming here. And I am grateful to the Dutch Government and also the Turkish Government to seeing this through. I am thankful to the contractors who had actually stayed on just like a few of the contractors of the Water Board and completed this project. So I am grateful to them for that. And moreover, I would like to reiterate the Water Boards commitment on keeping up with SDG 6, where we would want to provide clean and safe sanitation for everyone. I would also like to say that Honorable MP Kabir Hashim was instrumental in setting up this project, and were glad hes here. But I would also like to remind him that the President who is on this side is the one who has created the atmosphere to build all of these projects. We have taken the country out of bankruptcy and we have taken this country to a situation where abandoned projects are being restarted. State Minister of Water Supply Sanath Nishantha The current President laid the foundation stone for this water scheme in the year 2018 as the Prime Minister. We are happy that he came today to declare open this water scheme. Although Kegalle district is self-sufficient in water, drinking water has been provided to only 45 of the district. But today, I would like to say that the drinking water needs of about 60 of the people will be fulfilled with the opening of this water project. Drinking water supply in Trincomalee district is as high as 70 as well as in Ampara. I believe that although the protestors work to demolish Government property, they should struggle to gain such big projects. State Minister of Foreign Affairs Tharaka Balasuriya This water scheme will benefit a large number of people. This project started by the previous Government was continuously brought forward by our Government. When such important projects are brought forward, various conspiracies are carried out. Last night, some group set fire to a stock of pipes related to this scheme. Its worth more than 50 million rupees. At a time when the country was unstable, the President took charge of the country and directed the country towards a correct economic policy. Your economic reform program is very important. Also, I suggest to the President that a political reform program is also very necessary. I believe that this country will take a new leap through your new economic and political program. State Minister of Technology Kanaka Herath, This is the first time that the President visited Kegalle district after taking office. It is to nationalize this huge water scheme. This huge water scheme was started when we were in opposition. But it has been continued and the people have got the opportunity to reap its benefits today. There are several tourist attractions in Kegalle district. It is possible to promote the tourist attraction with tourist attractions such as the Elephant Orphanage, Zoo and Kitulgala Rafting. It should be remembered that with the green economy and the digital economy that the President is constantly talking about, there is the potential to take the economy of this country to a new dimension. Bonnie Horbach Ambassador of the Netherlands to Sri Lanka This project came about by pure sense of co-creation and cooperation and between Sri Lankan expertize, Dutch expertize and Turkish expertize. And it was the Sri Lankan knowledge of the locals situation and the local possibilities that allowed Ballast Nedam to put their engineering qualities in and build this amazing project which will allow a large number of people to get uninterrupted water access. A project that costs 81 million Euros. This project was very much also about sharing knowledge and allowing others to benefit from the project as well. And I think co-creation is all about allowing access to equal opportunities. And that is what I think the president is doing at the moment with the reform program, allowing equal opportunities for businesses to come and invest, co-create opportunities to get to co-create solutions for problems that arise in this country. And Im very proud to see Dutch companies and Dutch investors coming in and to work together with Sri Lankan companies; Sri Lankan expertize and to watch a better future and knowledge exchange and allowing the Sri Lankan people to benefit and prosper and in return. State Minister Ranjith Siyambalapitiya, Members of Parliament Kabir Hashim, Rajika Wickramasinghe, Sujith Sanjaya Perera, Udayakantha Gunathilaka, public representatives of Kegalle district and The Ambassador of Turkey to Sri Lanka, Demet Sekercioglu were also present on this occasion. --PMD--",

        "title": "G7 takes stand against Chinas economic coercion",
        "date": "May 21, 2023 06:03 pm",
        "content": "As the G7 leaders sent a strong message to Russia by inviting Volodymyr Zelensky to Hiroshima, another rival was also on their minds - China. British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said China posed the greatest challenge of our age in regards to global security and prosperity, and that it was increasingly authoritarian at home and abroad. And in not one but two statements, the leaders of the worlds richest democracies made clear to Beijing their stance on divisive issues such as the Indo-Pacific and Taiwan. But the most important part of their message centred on what they called economic coercion. Its a tricky balancing act for the G7. Through trade their economies have become inextricably dependent on China, but competition with Beijing has increased and they disagree on many issues including human rights. Now, they worry they are being held hostage. In recent years, Beijing has been unafraid to slap trade sanctions on countries that have displeased them. This includes South Korea, when Seoul installed a US missile defence system, and Australia during a recent period of chilly relations. The European Union was particularly alarmed when China blocked Lithuanian exports after the Baltic country allowed Taiwan to set up a de facto embassy there. So it is unsurprising that the G7 would condemn what they see as a disturbing rise of the weaponisation of economic vulnerabilities. This coercion, they said, seeks to undermine the foreign and domestic policies and positions of G7 members as well as partners around the world. They called for de-risking- a policy that Ms von der Leyen, who is attending the summit, has championed. This is a more moderate version of the US idea of decoupling from China, where they would talk tougher in diplomacy, diversify trade sources, and protect trade and technology. They have also launched a coordination platform to counter the coercion and work with emerging economies. While its still vague on how this would work exactly, were likely to see countries helping each other out by increasing trade or funding to work around any blockages put up by China. The G7 also plans to strengthen supply chains for important goods such as minerals and semiconductors, and beef up digital infrastructure to prevent hacking and stealing of technology. But the biggest stick they plan to wield is multilateral export controls. This means working together to ensure their technologies, particularly those used in military and intelligence, dont end up in the hands of malicious actors. The US is already doing this with its ban on exports of chips and chip technology to China, which Japan and the Netherlands have joined. The G7 is making clear such efforts would not only continue, but ramp up, despite Beijings protestations. They also said they would continue to crack down on the inappropriate transfers of technology shared through research activities. The US and many other countries have been concerned about industrial espionage and have jailed people accused of stealing tech secrets for China. At the same time, the G7 leaders were clear they did not want to sever the cord. Much of their language on economic coercion did not name China, in an apparent diplomatic attempt to not directly point a finger at Beijing. When they did talk about China, they stood their ground in a nuanced way. They sought to placate Beijing, saying their policies were not designed to harm China nor do we seek to thwart Chinas economic progress and development. They were not decoupling or turning inwards. But they also put pressure on the Chinese to cooperate, saying that a growing China that plays by international rules would be of global interest. They also called for candid engagement where they could still express their concerns directly to China, signalling their willingness to keep communication lines open in a tense atmosphere. We wont know how, privately, Chinese leaders and diplomats will take the G7s message. But state media in the past has hit back at the West for trying to have it both ways, by criticising China while also enjoying the fruits of their economic partnership. For now Beijing has chosen to fall back on its usual angry rhetoric for its public response. China had clearly anticipated the G7s statements and in the days leading up to the summit, its state media and embassies put out pieces accusing the US of its own economic coercion and hypocrisy. On Saturday evening, they accused the G7 of smearing and attacking China and lodged a complaint with summit organiser Japan. They also urged the other G7 countries not to become the US accomplice in economic coercion, and called on them to stop ganging up to form exclusive blocs and containing and bludgeoning other countries. It is worth noting that China has also sought to create its own alliances with other countries, and late last week just as the G7 summit kicked off, it hosted a parallel meeting with Central Asian countries. Its still not clear if the G7s plan will work. But it is likely to be welcomed by those who have called for a clear strategy to handle Chinas encroachments. Indo-Pacific and China expert Andrew Small praised the statement as having the feel of a real consensus, noting that it expressed the centre-ground view of the G7. There are still major debates playing out around what de-risking actually means, how far some of the sensitive technology export restrictions should go, and what sort of collective measures need to be taken against economic coercion, said Dr Small, a senior transatlantic fellow with the German Marshall Fund think tank. But there is now a clear and explicit framing around how the economic relationships with China among the advanced industrial economies need to be rebalanced. Source - BBC -Agencies",

        "date": "May 21, 2023 09:20 pm",
        "content": "With Sri Lanka mired in a severe food crisis, support from South Korea is crucial, the South Asian countrys representative for the U.N. World Food Program (WFP) has said. In an interview at WFPs Seoul office Thursday, Abdur Rahim Siddiqui thanked South Korea and noted WFPs meaningful partnership with the country through the Korea International Cooperation Agency (KOICA). Sri Lanka has been the recipient of considerable investment from Korea, with US81 million provided in 2022-2023 to date, Siddiqui said. WFP, too, has engaged in a meaningful partnership with Korea since 2019, and has received US11 million, through KOICA, towards its programs to enhance smallholder farmers resilience to climate change. This support has been instrumental in promoting self-reliance among climate-vulnerable farming communities while shielding them from the full effects of the countrys economic crisis. Siddiqui said nearly 3 in 10 households were noted as food insecure at the height of Sri Lankas economic crisis in 2022. The food crisis has come on the heels of an already vulnerable economy in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. Global food and energy price increases also led to inflation in Sri Lanka, Siddiqui added. He also said significant increases in food and fuel prices over the past year are forcing more than half of Sri Lankan households to adopt negative coping strategies, such as buying cheaper food to deal with reduced incomes. The support of partners like Korea is crucial to Sri Lankas recovery, Siddiqui said. By providing humanitarian actors with adequate resources, Korea can be instrumental in building sustainable solutions, strengthen food systems and help lift people out of the vicious cycle of poverty, food insecurity and malnutrition. Siddiqui was in South Korea to sign an agreement with the Korea Financial Industry Foundation, which will contribute 1 billion won (US754,600) over the next 30 months to the WFP Sri Lanka Home Grown School Feeding project. Through this, WFP supports school meal caterers to grow, produce and rear poultry for eggs in their own home gardens, Siddiqui said. This helps caterers overcome the challenge of rising food prices, while ensuring that children receive fresh, nutritious and diverse meals in school. The project began in March 2020 in two vulnerable regions, Monaragala in southern Sri Lanka and Matale in central Sri Lanka. It has since expanded to six other districts. Source  Yonhap -Agencies",

        "date": "May 22, 2023 10:27 am",
        "content": "The Indian rupee is expected to open weaker against the U.S. dollar after the central bank said it will withdraw the highest value currency note from circulation. Non-deliverable forwards indicate rupee will open at around 82.80-82.84 to the dollar, compared to 82.66 in the previous session. On Friday, the Reserve Bank of India said it will withdraw its highest denomination 2,000-rupee note from circulation. The impact on the rupee from RBIs step will be felt through the drop in forwards, analysts said. The USDINR forward premiums, which are already low, are expected to decline further with rupee money market rates likely to drop significantly on account of excess liquidity that RBIs move will lead to, said Abhiskek Goenka, CEO at FX advisory firm IFA Global. Rupee would come under pressure alongside the fall in the cost of carry (the forward premiums), Goenka said. Conducting sellbuy swaps (on USDINR) would address cash dollar shortage and suck out rupee liquidity and could offer respite. he said. 82.90 has been an important resistance for the pair. It will be interesting to see if the RBI puts a cap here. In contrast to the rupee, other Asian currencies were mostly higher after U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell struck a moderately dovish stance, contrary to market expectations. Powell said on Friday it is still unclear if U.S. interest rates will need to rise further. After Powells speech, market pricing is firmly back to thinking the Fed will pause, Chris Weston, head research at Melbourne-based Pepperstone said in an email. Odds of a rate hike at the June meeting, which had been moving up in recent days in view of the resilient U.S. data, were down back to less than 10. The dollar index was down to 103.02. The Korean won led Asian currencies higher.

        "content": "The Elections Commission says that Minister Mahinda Amaraweera or MP Thilanga Sumathipala holding the post of General Secretary of the United Peoples Freedom Alliance (UPFA) will not be accepted until relevant inquiries are over. In a response letter issued to Minister Amaraweera, the Additional Commissioner of Elections (Legal and Investigation) emphasizes that it has drawn attention to all the facts presented by both parties. Furthermore, the letter mentions that since the issue is currently being heard before courts, the commission will suspend accepting Minister Mahinda Amaraweera or MP Thilanga Sumathipala as the General Secretary of the UPFA until a verdict is delivered by the court. Last year, the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) decided to remove the MPs of the party who have accepted ministerial portfolios in the incumbent government from all their positions in the party. Accordingly, Nimal Siripala de Silva, Mahinda Amaraweera, Lasantha Alagiyawanna, Ranjith Siyambalapitiya, Jagath Pushpakumara and Chamara Sampath Dassanayake were removed from all positions held by them in the party and were also stripped of their SLFP central committee membership. In the meantime, the Central Committee of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) had unanimously decided to appoint MP Thilanga Sumathipala as the General Secretary of the United Peoples Freedom Alliance (UPFA), on November 21, 2022. However, the following day five constituent parties of the UPFA had declared that they did not accept MP Thilanga Sumathipala as the new General Secretary of the political alliance, pointing out that they were not notified regarding the removal of Minister Mahinda Amaraweera, who was the General Secretary of the UPFA, or the appointment of a new General Secretary. Further, they pointed out that the executive council or the allied parties of the alliance must be informed in this regard in accordance with the constitution of the UPFA and its previous precedents. However, a case pertaining to the matter, filed by Minister Mahinda Amaraweera is being heard in the Colombo District Court. The relevant case was filed by Minister Amaraweera naming several respondents, including President of the UPFA Maithripala Sirisena, MPs Dayasiri Jayasekara, Vadivel Suresh, Thilanga Sumathipala and others, challenging the decision to remove him from the post of Secretary General of the UPFA.",

        "date": "May 22, 2023 12:20 pm",
        "content": "In a significant move to address Sri Lankas fuel supply challenges, a contract agreement was signed with Sinopec, a leading international petroleum company. The agreement, signed today (22), marks a crucial step in ensuring a steady and uninterrupted fuel supply for the nation, the Presidents Media Division (PMD) said. The signing ceremony took place at the Presidential Secretariat, with representatives from both Sri Lanka and Sinopec in attendance. Secretary of the Ministry of Power and Energy M.P.D.U.K. Mapa Pathirana and Chen Chengmin, Managing Director of Fuel Production and Marketing Department of Sinopec Company, signed the agreement in front of the President, it added. On the Sri Lanka side, the Secretary of the Ministry of Power and Energy, the Chairman  Managing Director of the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation, and the Chairman of the Ceylon Petroleum Storage Terminals Limited participated. From Sinopec, representatives from Sinopec Fuel Oil Lanka (Private) Limited, Sinopec Fuel Oil Sales Co. Ltd (Peoples Republic of China), and Sinopec Fuel Oil (Singapore) Pte. Ltd. were present to formalize the agreement. In response to the on-going foreign exchange crisis in Sri Lanka, the Ministry of Power and Energy has taken this decisive action to ensure an uninterrupted fuel supply to consumers. With the inability to provide sufficient foreign exchange for fuel shipments, the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) and Lanka Indian Oil Company (LIOC) faced significant challenges, according to the PMD. To tackle this issue, the Ministry explored various strategies and one of them involved inviting Expression of Interests (EOIs) from reputable petroleum companies established in producing countries. The goal was to import, store, distribute, and sell Petroleum Products in predetermined Distribution Dealer operated Networks in Sri Lanka. The Cabinet of Ministers approved this initiative. One of the key requirements for new retail suppliers entering the market was their ability to secure forex requirements without depending on the domestic banking sector. It was mandated that these companies source their own funds for fuel procurement through foreign sources, at least during the initial one-year period of operation. After receiving EOIs, the companies that were shortlisted were invited to submit detailed proposals in response to a Request for Proposal (RFP) document. The Cabinet Appointed Special Committee (CASC) and the Technical Evaluation Committee (TEC) thoroughly scrutinized the proposals and recommended awarding contracts to the following companies, subject to negotiations:  Ms Sinopec Fuel Oil Lanka (Private) Limited, F5, Hambantota Maritime Center, Mirijjawila, Hambantota, Sri Lanka  Ms United Petroleum Pty Ltd, 600 Glenferrie Rd, Hawthorn, Victoria 3122, Australia  Ms RM Parks, 1061 N. Main St, Porterville, CA 93257, USA, in collaboration with Shell PLC The Cabinet of Ministers, considering the recommendations made by the CASC and the Committee Appointed by the Cabinet, granted approval to award the contracts to the selected suppliers. Sinopec, along with its affiliated companies, is set to commence operations in Sri Lanka within 45 days following the issuance of the license. This development brings hope for a more stable and reliable fuel supply, boosting the countrys energy sector and providing assurance to consumers. Minister of Power and Energy Kanchana Wijesekera, State Ministers D.V. Chanaka, Indika Anuruddha, Shehan Semasingha, Presidents Senior Advisor on National Security and Chief of Staff Sagala Ratnayake, Presidents Secretary Saman Ekanayake, Central Bank Governor Dr. Nandalal Weerasinghe, Chinese Ambassador Qi Zhenhong and representatives of Sinopec Oil Lanka Pvt. Ltd, Sinopec China Pvt Ltd and Sinopec Singapore Pvt Ltd were present on this occasion, according to the PMD. The deal with Sinopec-- a state-owned Chinese company --was reached months after the two sides commenced their negotiations and Sri Lanka approved a proposal in March to liberalise the fuel retail marketing in the country with more players from China, Australia and the US. Sri Lankas fuel retail market was a state monopoly under the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) until 2003 when the Indian Oil Company (IOC) was allowed to operate. Negotiations have been completed with Sinopec Fuel Oil Lanka Ltd and its parent company in China and Singapore for a long-term contract on important storage, distribution and sale of petroleum products in the island nation, the statement issued by the presidents office said. In March, the Cabinet of Ministers had granted approval to award licenses to Chinas Sinopec, Australias United Petroleum and RM Parks of the USA, in collaboration with multinational oil and gas company - Shell plc, to enter the fuel retail market in Sri Lanka. Thereby, they are be granted a license to operate for 20 years to import, store, distribute and sell petroleum products in Sri Lanka. In June 2022, the Cabinet of Ministers had green-lighted the proposal to open up Sri Lankas fuel import and retail sales market to companies from oil-producing nations. In October the same year, the Petroleum Products (Special Provisions) Bill, paving the way for new suppliers to enter as importers, distributors and retail operators for petroleum products, was approved by the Ministerial Consultative Committee on Power and Energy. Later on April 26, a team of officials from Sinopec visited Sri Lanka in order to finalise the agreements and commencement of operations for retail fuel sales, and accordingly, the timeline, conditions of the relevant agreement and other concerns were discussed between the team of officials and technical experts from the Chines energy giant and the Minister of Power and Energy, Kanchana Wijesekera. It had been decided that the agreements would be signed in mid-May, and that operation would commence 45 days thereon. Also, the US-based oil company RM Parks Inc. and the British multinational oil and gas company Shell PLC had held discussions with Minister Wijesekera on commencing retail fuel sales in Sri Lanka in the first week of June this year. Wijesekera, joining the political talk show 360 on TV Derana earlier in April, revealed that each company will handle 150 CPC dealer-operated filling stations in the local market. At present, a total of 1,142 filling stations are under the purview of the CPC, however, the corporation fully owns only 234 of them, the minister explained, adding that 450 out of the remaining 908 filling stations owned by private distributors would be allocated to the three foreign oil companies.",

        "title": "Beijing rebukes Japan, Britain over anti-China G7 summit",
        "date": "May 22, 2023 03:01 pm",
        "content": "(Reuters) - State-backed Chinese mouthpiece Global Times called the G7 an anti-China workshop on Monday, a day after Beijing summoned Japans envoy and berated Britain in a fiery response to statements issued at the groups summit in Hiroshima. Group of Seven (G7) declarations issued on Saturday singled out China on issues including Taiwan, nuclear arms, economic coercion and human rights abuses, underscoring the wide-ranging tensions between Beijing and the group of rich countries which includes the United States. The U.S. is pushing hard to weave an anti-China net in the Western world, Global Times said in an editorial on Monday titled G7 has descended into an anti-China workshop. This is not just a matter of brutal interference in Chinas internal affairs and smearing China, but also an undisguised urge for confrontation between the camps. Beijings foreign ministry said it firmly opposed the statement by the G7 - which also includes Japan, Britain, Canada, France, Germany and Italy - and late Sunday said it had summoned Japans ambassador to China in a pointed protest to the summit host. Russia, a close ally of China that was also called out in the G7 statement over its war in Ukraine, said the summit was an incubator for anti-Russian and anti-Chinese hysteria. Separately, Chinas embassy in Britain urged London to stop slandering China, after British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said Beijing represents the worlds greatest challenge to security and prosperity. The main G7 leaders communique mentioned China 20 times, the most in recent years, and up from 14 mentions in 2022. Chinas reaction this time is quite intense, said Wang Jiangyu, a professor at City University of Hong Kong. The G7 mentioned many concerns (over China) in an unprecedented way. China view these issues as its core interests that are entirely its internal affairs which are not for the G7 to wag their tongues about, he said. As well as taking issue with G7 comments on Taiwan, the democratic island China claims as its own, Beijing also accused the U.S. and its allies of double standards over comments about a nuclear build-up and the use of economic leverage. Despite Beijings reaction, U.S. President Joe Biden said he expected a thaw in frosty relations with China very shortly. Some analysts, however, see no sign of any immediate easing of tensions, especially given Beijings rapid and sharp rebuttal. Beijings reaction (especially the early timing of its release) underlines that tensions in the region are already quite high and likely to increase further, said Moritz Rudolf, research scholar and fellow at Yale Universitys Paul Tsai China Center. JAPAN BACKLASH Chinas decision to summon Japans ambassador underlined the intensity of its anger, some analysts said. Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Sun Weidong summoned the ambassador to register protests over hype around China-related issues, the ministry said in a statement. Sun said Japan collaborated with the other countries at the G7 summit to smear and attack China, grossly interfering in Chinas internal affairs, violating the basic principles of international law and the spirit of the four political documents between China and Japan, referring to the China-Japan Joint Statement of 1972. Japans ambassador to China, Hideo Tarumi, said it was natural for the G7 to refer to issues of common concern as it has done in the past and will continue to do so in the future as long as China does not change its behaviour, according to a readout. Wang Yiwei, an international relations professor at the Renmin University in Beijing, described Chinas overall reaction to the G7 communique as restrained but singled out Japan as particularly provocative. He referred to Japans pick for the summit venue Hiroshima, the city flattened by an atomic bomb at the end of World War II, and its push for a joint statement on nuclear disarmament that raised concern about Chinas nuclear arsenal. The main thing thats happening here is Japan, using its position as the rotating chair, to create an anti-China movement, said Wang Yiwei. Among the G7, Tokyo has also voiced some of the strongest concerns about Chinas muscular rhetoric around Taiwan, which sits just off its southern island chain. China has never renounced the use of force to bring Taiwan under its control. Japans Chief Cabinet Secretary Hirokazu Matsuno said on Monday that the countrys policy toward China has been consistent, that it will insist on matters that are needed and urge responsible behaviour, while take steps to address concerns and cooperate on common issues.

        "content": "(Reuters) - Sri Lankas National Consumer Price Index (NCPI) inflation eased to 33.6 year-on-year in April, after a 49.2 rise in March, the statistics department said on Monday. The NCPI captures broader retail price inflation and is released with a lag of 21 days every month. Food prices eased sharply to 27.1 in April from 42.3 in March, while non-food inflation was at 39, the Department of Census and Statistics said in a statement. The data comes as an International Monetary Fund team is in Colombo to evaluate Sri Lankas economy for the first time since the global lender approved a nearly 3 billion bailout in March for Sri Lanka, grappling with its worst financial crisis in seven decades because of economic mismanagement and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Colombo Consumer Price Index, released at the end of each month, dropped to 35.3 in April from 50.3 in March, data from the statistics department showed. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "title": "Sri Lanka eyes Chinese tourism to help ease debt crisis",
        "date": "May 22, 2023 04:55 pm",
        "content": "Sri Lanka is mulling measures to lure back Chinese tourists in a bid to alleviate an unprecedented debt crisis, its tourism minister said, as the South Asian nation tries to stabilize the economy. The country is targeting half a million Chinese tourists in 2024, nearly double its pre-Covid visitor levels, Tourism Minister Harin Fernando said at a press briefing in Beijing on Monday. If each Chinese tourist spent 5,000 that could raise a figure comparable to the recent International Monetary Fund bailout, he said. If you really look at it, tourism can get Sri Lanka out of this mess, the minister added. Sri Lanka clinched a 3 billion bailout loan from the IMF in March after six months of negotiations. It is still trying to reach a debt restructuring agreement that would help the release of the next round of funds. China has been an observer to those talks. Paris Club members account for 4.8 billion, or more than 10 of Sri Lankas external debt, according to IMF data. Thats slightly higher than China, which stands at 4.5 billion, while India is owed 1.8 billion. Palitha Kohona, Sri Lankas ambassador to China, who was also at the event in Beijing, said bilateral debt talks were ongoing. Fernando said hed presented a plan to Sri Lankas government that included free tourist visas for Chinese travelers until November. They can just walk into Sri Lanka with a Chinese passport, he said. The minister also said he was holding talks with Chinese carriers, including China Southern Airlines and Air China, asking them to increase the number of flights to Sri Lanka. This month, carriers are operating 92 flights between the two countries, down from 174 in the same month in 2019, according to flight data provider Cirium. Sri Lanka has battled its worst economic problems since independence in recent years, after protests over soaring inflation, food shortages and lengthy power cuts toppled the government. A series of deadly terror blasts in 2019 also hit tourism arrivals, along with the subsequent Covid pandemic. Before all that, Sri Lanka saw some 266,000 Chinese arrivals in 2018, according to the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority. That fell sharply to 167,863 the following year, according to the authority. The return of Chinese tourists is considered essential to the rebound of global tourism, but outbound travel is still lagging pre-pandemic levels. More than half of Chinese travelers said they hadnt set plans to go abroad this year in a survey published last month. Source  Bloomberg -Agencies",

The motion to remove the PUCSL Chairman is to be taken up for debate in Parliament on May 24 from 10.30 am to 5pm, followed by a vote. The motion is being presented in accordance with Section 7 of the Sri Lanka Public Utilities Commission Act, No. 35 of 2002. Responding to a question from journalists today, the minister said that they will back the Minister of Power and Energy on this matter in his bid to take this country forward and in order to bring in a non-bias person into the commission. He said: Regarding the issue that pertains to the Chairman of the PUCSL, I have already mentioned it earlier and I will mention it again, the honorable minister Kanchana Wijesekera has made tremendous changes to this country in terms of administration and in terms of the structure in which this country has been running, especially with relation to the power and energy sector. And when thats the case, if there seems to be any entity who is politically motivated in order to paint a picture that the government is not going through its changes or we are trying to do something detrimental to this country, when in reality we are just trying to do a course correction, then we dont believe that person should be entertained hereafter. Thought the person was appointed by an independent commission, I highly doubt he has acted independently, Minister Thondaman said. I would like to say that our support is with the Minister on this and in order to bring in a non-bias person into this commission where theyll be able to take forward the governments position in making the Power and Energy Ministry a self-sustaining authority where it is not going to be a burden to this country, he added. As everyone is aware, close to Rs. 300 million have been made in losses, and still the chairman found funding to buy himself a Range Rover. So, I dont understand what the issue exactly is. All Im trying to say is, in Minister Kanchanas bid to take this country forward, the Ceylon Workers Congress will support him unconditionally, the minister stressed.",

        "content": "Sri Lanka has to pay INR 890 million to the Government of India for the support it extended when the New Diamond and X-Press Pearl vessels were ravaged by fire on Sri Lankan waters, the Minister of Justice, Prisons Affairs  Constitutional Reforms says. Joining the 360 political talk show on TV Derana on Monday night (May 22), Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe said India has sought reimbursement in writing to the Sri Lankan government. Speaking further, Rajapakshe said: The Sri Lanka Navy (SLN), Sri Lanka Air Force (SLAF) and, at our request, the Indian Navy worked together to douse the flames ravaging the New Diamond ship and to minimize the environmental damage. For the contribution made by the Indian Navy in this regard, they have sought INR 400 million  approximately LKR 1,400 million. These are not rumours. ... They have asked for INR 490 million for the X-Press Pearl and INR 400 million for the New Diamond. On September 03, 2020, the MT New Diamond was engulfed in flames about 65km off the Sangamankanda Point on the eastern coast of Sri Lanka. An explosion of a boiler in the main engine room had led to this unfortunate turn of events, which resulted in the death of one crew member and a major oil spill. The tanker was transporting 270,000 metric tons of crude oil from the port of Mina Al Ahmadi in Kuwait to the Indian port of Paradip at the time of the incident. It was also reported that 1,700 metric tons of diesel required for the use of the tanker were stored onboard. On May 20, 2021, Sri Lanka witnessed what is considered one of the worst marine environmental disasters after the Singapore-flagged container ship vessel MV X-Press Pearl, only three months after being commissioned, caught fire some 16km off Colombo. At the time of the incident, it was transporting at least 1,500 containers including 25 tonnes of nitric acid, other chemicals and low-density polyethylene pellets. The fire that raged for nearly two weeks resulted in a massive spillage of damaged containers, microplastics, plastic pellets, chemicals and other harmful substances into the sea before the wreckage of the vessel sank on June 02, 2021 while being towed away to deeper waters. It was revealed that the fire had been the result of a reaction of the chemicals being transported on the ship, from which 25 crew members were evacuated safely.",

        "content": "Seven bodies were recovered from a Chinese fishing vessel that capsized in the central Indian Ocean, according to state media on Monday, days after China President Xi Jinping ordered an all-out search to rescue and recover missing crew members. Several countries, including Australia, India, Sri Lanka, Indonesia, the Maldives, and the Philippines, joined in rescue efforts for 39 missing crew members after the Chinese distant-water fishing vessel Lupeng Yuanyu 028 capsized early last Tuesday, state-run CCTV reported. The vessel is owned by Penglai Jinglu Fishery Co Ltd based in Shandong province. The company has yet to release a statement on the incident. Of the 39 people that were originally on board - 17 Chinese crew members, 17 Indonesians and five from the Philippines - it was not immediately clear which crew members were found. Sri Lankan divers found and recovered the remains in the cabin of the ship, CCTV reported according to the Chinese Ministry of Transport. The wrecked vessel continues to slowly drift eastward, CCTV said. According to state media, 13 ships are still in the vicinity of where the boat sank. CCTV footage last week showed high-powered marine radar on ships that were trying to locate the capsized vessel, while crew members were seen using visual equipment to pan sea waters to locate survivors. Last Thursday, the Chinese foreign ministry said President Xi instructed that additional rescue forces be sent and that international maritime search assistance be coordinated. Chinas ambassador to Australia urged Canberra on Thursday to step up its rescue efforts to help locate the missing. Source: Reuters -Agencies",

The injuries are not serious, and the peacekeepers from the UN mission in Mali, known as MINUSMA (UN Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali), are receiving medical treatment, said Stephane Dujarric, the chief spokesman for UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres. The incident occurred on Sunday about 12 km northwest of their camp in Tessalit, in the Kidal region, Dujarric said. When the blast occurred, they were in an armored vehicle providing security for a logistics convoy. About 40 minutes after the incident, a search of the surrounding area discovered a second IED which was successfully detonated, he said. Earlier in the day, the mission had detonated another IED discovered some 23 km northwest of the Tessalit camp. The spokesman said the attack on the peacekeepers was indicative of the continuing violence in Mali. The UN staff union reported earlier this year that the MINUSMA mission was the most deadly of any world body assignment for the ninth year, with 14 personnel killed in 2022.

        "title": "Madeleine McCann: Portuguese Police begin new search for girl missing since 2007",
        "date": "May 23, 2023 12:14 pm",
        "content": "Police investigating the disappearance of Madeleine McCann are to carry out searches at a reservoir in Portugal. A search of the Arade dam will begin on Tuesday, 50km from where the toddler went missing in Praia da Luz in 2007. Christian Brueckner, 45, was made a formal suspect, or an arguido, by Portuguese prosecutors in 2022. The search was requested by German police as the area was visited by Brueckner when Madeleine, then three years old, disappeared. Madeleine, from Rothley, Leicestershire, had been on holiday with her family in Portugals Algarve when she went missing on 3 May 2007. Portuguese police said in a press statement that it is co-ordinating searches in the Algarve over the next few days, with British officers also present. Hans Christian Wolters, German state prosecutor in Braunschweig, told the BBC a short statement of confirmation would be released by the German authorities on Tuesday morning. An area of the reservoirs peninsula just over a mile long was sealed off by police shortly after midday on Monday, Portuguese television network SIC reported. The search is expected to take place on Tuesday and Wednesday, it said. Police have erected blue tents and are closing off roads leading to the man-made dam, while a total of 20 police officers have been assigned to the search. Mr Wolters is treating Brueckner as the main suspect in the McCann case, although he has never been charged over Madeleines disappearance and has denied any involvement. The state prosecutor said a growing amount of evidence had connected Brueckner to the case, including his mobile phone records showing he was in the Praia de Luz area at the time of Madeleines disappearance. Brueckner, a German national, is currently in prison in Germany for the rape of a 72-year-old woman in 2005 in the same area where Madeleine McCann went missing. He was living near the Praia da Luz resort when the McCann family was on holiday, and spent time in the area between 2000 and 2017. It is not the first time the reservoir has been searched as part of the investigation. In 2008, Portuguese lawyer Marcos Aragao Correia paid for specialist divers to check the waterway after he claimed to have been tipped off by criminal contacts that Madeleines body was in the reservoir. The most recent search in Portugal in relation to Madeleines disappearance was in 2014, when British police were given permission to examine scrubland near where she vanished. Earlier this month, Madeleines parents, Kate and Gerry, held a vigil to mark the 16th anniversary of her disappearance. They also marked their daughters 20th birthday in May, vowing to never give up on finding their daughter. Happy birthday Madeleine. Still missing. Still very much missed. Still looking. For as long as it takes, they said in a post on the official Facebook page of the Find Madeleine Campaign. We love you and were waiting for you. Were never going to give up. Source - BBC - Agencies",

The mission discussed recent economic developments and the implementation of the IMF-supported programme, including additional fiscal efforts that will be critical to ensure successful revenue mobilization for Sri Lanka, and the debt restructuring process, not excluding the ongoing discussions with both foreign and domestic creditors. Issuing a statement following their visit, the IMF team said, Achieving timely restructuring agreements with creditors in line with the program targets by the time of the first review is essential to restoring debt sustainability. Keeping up the reform momentum and ensuring timely implementation of program commitments, including to ensure central bank independence, improve governance, and protect the vulnerable, are key for Sri Lanka to emerge from the economic crisis. An IMF mission led by Messrs. Peter Breuer and Masahiro Nozaki conducted a staff visit to Colombo from 11 to 23 May. Accordingly, while recent macroeconomic and financial sector developments were discussed during the meeting, the staff team recognised that following strong policy efforts, the macroeconomic situation in Sri Lanka is showing tentative signs of improvement, with inflation moderating, the exchange rate stabilizing, and the Central Bank rebuilding reserves buffers. Despite these advancements, however, they highlighted that the overall macroeconomic and policy environment remains challenging. We welcome the authorities ongoing efforts in meeting key commitments under the Fundsupported program. Performance under the program will be formally assessed in the context of the first review of the Extended Fund Facility arrangement, which is expected to be undertaken in September 2023, the statement further read. During their visit, the IMF staff team met with President and Minister of Finance Ranil Wickremesinghe, Governor Weerasinghe, Secretary to the Treasury Siriwardana, senior government officials, members of the opposition parties, CSOs, think tanks, trade unions, the private sector, and development partners.

        "date": "May 23, 2023 04:32 pm",
        "content": "A Malaysian comedian has had his Chinese social media account suspended after poking fun at China in one of his shows. Nigel Ng, who goes by the name Uncle Roger, is better known for mocking attempts at Asian cooking by Western chefs. But the 32-year-old is now the latest comedian to feel the consequences of making jokes at the expense of China, amid increasingly intense censorship and rising nationalism. It comes after a Chinese comedian became the subject of a police investigation last week for making a joke about stray dogs. Last Thursday, Ng posted a video clip from an upcoming comedy special in which he pokes fun at Chinese surveillance and Beijings claims of sovereignty over Taiwan. It shows the comedian interacting with someone in the audience who said he was from Guangzhou, a metropolis in Chinas south. Good country, good country, we have to say that now, correct? Ng says. All the phones listening. He then jokes with members of the audience who said theyre from Taiwan, a self-governed island claimed by China, saying Taiwan is not a real country. I hope one day you rejoin the motherland. One China, he said. Following his comments, Ngs Weibo account said on Monday that he was banned from posting for violating relevant laws and regulations. His agency did not respond to a request for comment. Meanwhile, Chinese comedian Li Haoshi is facing prison time as police and government departments investigate him for a joke he made at a performance earlier this month. Beijing police announced last week that they were looking into the star for severely insulting the Peoples Liberation Army. Li, who goes by the stage name HOUSE, joked about stray dogs by riffing on a well-known propaganda slogan used to describe the Chinese military. He said he had adopted two dogs which were very energetic when they chased after squirrels, shooting off like artillery shells after a target. The comedian said that while most dogs were cute, his dogs remind him of the Chinese phrase, Able to win battles, with first-rate style. According to the China Media Project, which studies Chinese media, the phrase was first used around 10 years ago by Chinese leader Xi Jinping to describe planned reforms for the Chinese military. In a statement last week, a government department known as Beijings Comprehensive Team of Law Enforcement on Cultural Market said it had received tips from the public about Lis performance on 13 May. In response, it said it had launched an investigation into the company the comedian is signed with. Chinese police said they would fine the company, Xiao Guo Wenhua, for around 13.3 million yuan (1.6m). The company did not respond to a request for comment. An officer who did not give his name at Beijings police headquarters declined to say whether Li was under detention or arrest, saying the investigation was continuing and the results would be publicised accordingly.

The PUCSL Chairman also raised concerns pertaining to the increasing energy poverty in Sri Lanka, adding that, as per the governments statistics, the number of families currently facing extreme poverty stands at a figure of three million. This group uses between 0 and 60 units of electricity per month. According to new data on electricity consumption, the number of electricity consumers who do not use a single unit per month has increased to 436,000 as of last February. About 600,000 of consumers who used more than 90 units per month fell into the categories of consuming less than 60 units. These data show that energy poverty has increased due to the recent increase in electricity tariffs. This situation should be rectified immediately, he emphasised. Ratnayake further noted that with the upcoming tax revision, the PUCSL aims to give justice to those who were unfairly affected by the baseless tariff revision implemented in February, including those in the domestic sector, religious places and tourist hotels. Commenting in this regard, he explained that the fees in religious places should be reduced in an affordable manner, adding that attention will also be paid to those sectors that help generate foreign exchange. In order to maintain the tourism industry, export industries etc. sustainably, energy costs should be reduced as much as possible, he said.",
