        "content": "India and Sri Lanka are giving a fresh push to the long-pending power grid connectivity between the two countries to trade electricity. Work has started on updating a detailed project report for the connectivity either through overhead line or undersea cable in the sea portion of the connectivity, following a meeting on the proposal last month, said people familiar with the matter. The timeline for a draft detailed project report is September 15, after which it will be discussed between the two sides for finalisation, they said. Sri Lanka will carry out the necessary load flow studies for 2027-28 time frame of its network, considering 500 MW exchange from India through the proposed link, according to the people. India will study the necessary load flow studies on the combined network data based on the inputs from the Sri Lankan side. This is likely to be completed by August 21. The reports will then be discussed with the officials in the joint technical team, comprising members from the Central Electricity Authority, Power Grid Corporation of India Ltd and the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) formed in 2016. The cross-border interconnection plan has been under discussion for nearly two decades now. It was marred by high project cost, making it unviable, according to people aware of the matter.

        "content": "The FBI said its agents shot and killed a Utah man on Wednesday during a raid that a source said targeted the man for allegedly making threats against U.S. President Joe Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris and law enforcement officials. The FBI in Salt Lake City said the shooting occurred early on Wednesday as agents attempted to serve arrest and search warrants at a residence in Provo, south of Salt Lake City. The FBI did not identify the man or say why it was seeking an arrest. The FBI takes all shooting incidents involving our agents or task force members seriously, it said in a statement, adding that the incident was under review. Biden, who was scheduled to visit Utah on Wednesday, was briefed on the FBI raid, a White House official said, referring further questions on the matter to the FBI. A federal complaint shared with Reuters by the U.S. Attorneys Office for Utah named the suspect as Craig Robertson. He posted online in September calling for the assassination of Biden and Harris, the complaint shows. He also allegedly made online threats against Biden ahead of his scheduled Utah visit. The man also made threats against Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg as Bragg led a criminal inquiry into former President Donald Trump, and made threats against U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland, the complaint shows. In one post attached in the complaint, the suspect said he was heading to New York to fulfill my dream of iradicating (eradicating) Bragg. The complaint showed that the suspect faced charges on three counts: interstate threats, threats against the president, and influencing, impeding and retaliating against federal law enforcement officers by threat. The complaint and the raid were reported earlier by ABC News. The Secret Service is aware of the FBI investigation involving an individual in Utah who has exhibited threats towards a protectee, the Secret Service, which provides protection for the president, vice president and their families, said on Wednesday. Political violence in a polarized United States has risen in recent years, with a Reuters report released Wednesday showing it is at its worst since the 1970s. Source: Reuters -Agencies",

        "content": "Finance State Minister Shehan Semasinghe says the recent economic crisis has been a catalyst for the long-ignored reforms that would finally put an end to these economic vulnerabilities. We believe that this provides Sri Lanka with the opportunity to finally fulfill the tremendous potential that has been suppressed for too long. This creates great opportunity from an investment perspective across multiple asset classes. The lawmakers remarks came during the Invest Sri Lanka Investor Forum India in Chennai and Mumbai on Wednesday (Aug. 09). The forum was organized by the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) in association with the Confederation of the Indian Industry (CII) and stockbroker firms. This is a series of forums that promote foreign portfolio investment into the Sri Lankan stock market by showcasing investment opportunities in Sri Lanka. He emphasized that this is an ideal time for investors to position themselves to benefit from investing in Sri Lanka, as the island nation is preparing to embark on a rapid economic recovery followed by sustainable and equitable growth. While addressing this forum, the state minister highlighted Sri Lankas attractiveness from an investment perspective, which has long been apparent but thwarted by persistent macroeconomic imbalances. Speaking further, Semasinghe said, as inflation returns to single-digit levels, locked in by strong institutional and legislative reforms, the expected decline in interest rates creates clear opportunities in both equity and fixed-income markets. At a firm level the decline in interest rates will ease finance costs that have hurt the bottom line for many companies in the recent past, he commented further, adding that lower rates will spur investment in anticipation of economic growth in the coming period.",

        "date": "August 10, 2023 11:11 am",
        "content": "A candidate in Ecuadors forthcoming presidential election has been shot dead at a campaign rally. Fernando Villavicencio, a member of the countrys national assembly, was attacked as he left the event in the northern city of Quito on Wednesday. A member of his campaign team told local media Mr Villavicencio was getting into a car when a man stepped forward and shot him in the head. Current president Guillermo Lasso vowed the crime will not go unpunished. Witnesses said Mr Villavicencio, 59, was shot three times. The suspect was also shot in an exchange of bullets with security and later died from his injuries, the countrys attorney general said on social media. They added that nine people suffered injuries, including a candidate for assembly and two police officers. The first round of the presidential election is scheduled to take place on 20 August. Mr Lasso, who will not be on the ballot, said he was outraged and shocked by the killing, adding: Organised crime has come a long way, but the full weight of the law is going to fall on them. A recent rise in violent crime, fuelled by the growing presence of drug cartels in Ecuador, has been a central issue in this years presidential campaign. Last month, Mr Lasso declared states of emergency and night curfews in three provinces following a number of killings linked to organised crime. As well as security, Mr Villavicencios campaign had focused on tackling corruption, a topic he had covered in an earlier career as a journalist, and reducing environmental destruction. Last week, he said he and his team had been threatened by the leader of a gang linked to drug trafficking. Mr Villavicencio, who was married and had five children, was one of eight candidates in the first round of the election, although not the frontrunner. His killing follows that of Agustín Intriago, mayor of the city of Manta, in July and Omar Menéndez, candidate for mayor in the city of Puerto López, in February. Paying tribute, Mr Villavicencios party, Movimiento Construye, shared a comment he posted to social media in response to calls to suspend the presidential campaign following Mr Intriagos death. Hiding in moments when criminals assassinate citizens and officials is an act of cowardice, he wrote. Former vice president and fellow candidate Otto Sonnenholzner sent his deepest condolences and deep solidarity to Mr Villavicencios family. May God keep him in his glory, he wrote. Our country has gotten out of hand. Frontrunner Luisa Gonzales also shared her solidarity to Mr Villavicencios family, adding: This vile act will not go unpunished. Source  BBC --Agencies",

President of the association Chanaka Dharmawickrema emphasized that the ongoing shortage of radiological technologists has made the provision of these services problematic. Furthermore, he alleged that although the Ministry of Health was informed regarding the matter, they have not taken steps to recruit new officers yet. Over the next few months, CT scanning, MRIs, PET scanning and radiology services at operating rooms, catheterization units at cardiology departments in the government hospital system may collapse. At present, the services are being carried out with a shortage of around 40 of employees, he added. Commenting further, Dharmawickrema said there is a trend of nearly 3-4 radiology technologists emigrating monthly. At present, the radiological services at Eheliyagoda Hospital have completely collapsed. The reason is that the only radiological technologist who worked at the hospital has gone abroad a few months ago, he said.

        "date": "August 10, 2023 12:00 pm",
        "content": "Pakistans parliament was dissolved by President Arif Alvi on Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharifs advice late Wednesday night, the presidents office said, setting the stage for a national election amid political and economic crises. The advice came three days ahead of the parliaments five-year term, which expires on Aug. 12. It will be followed with a caretaker administration to be picked by Sharif and an opposition leader in the outgoing parliament to hold new elections in 90 days. I will tonight advise the president to dissolve the parliament, the premier had earlier told the parliament. He said he would start discussions with the opposition leader on Thursday to pick from candidates recommended from both sides to nominate as caretaker prime minister. The vote, however, could be delayed several months with the election commission set to start redrawing hundreds of constituencies based on a fresh census. Analysts have said any delay in the election could fuel public anger and add to uncertainty in the nuclear-armed nation. The last general election in July 2018 was won by the party of cricketer-turned-politician Imran Khan, who was sworn in days later as prime minister for the first time. Khan has been at the heart of political turmoil since he was ousted as prime minister in a no-confidence vote last year, raising concern about Pakistans stability. He has since been convicted and jailed in a graft case, following which he has been barred from taking part in any election for five years. Khan has accused the powerful military, which has ruled Pakistan intermittently since independence in 1947, of being responsible for his ouster. The military has denied the charge. Khan was replaced by Sharif, who has been grappling with a debilitating economic crisis and historically high inflation levels as the government implemented painful reforms to secure funding from the International Monetary Fund (IMF). In addition to the legal issues that could crop up if the vote is delayed, the side-lining of Khan, the countrys most popular leader according to polls, will cast doubt over the credibility of the elections.

The All-Ceylon Agrarian Federation (ACAF) staged a Satyagraha campaign in late July, urging the government to release water from Samanalawewa reservoir to Udawalawe reservoir. The farmers had vowed not to abandon their cause until their demands were met. The protesting farmers called off the Satyagraha campaign, which entered its 18th consecutive day today, as they have now received adequate amount of water for their croplands. The irrigation authorities began releasing water from Samanalawewa reservoir to Udawalawe reservoir in the early hours of Tuesday (Aug. 08) at a rate of 3.5 million cubic meters per day for three days after the Cabinet of Ministers green-lighted the a proposal seeking to address the matter. The active water capacity of the Udawalawe reservoir, which has a total water capacity of 217,800 acre-feet, had dropped to 956 acre-feet as of Monday morning (Aug 07). This was merely 0.45 of the full water capacity of the water body. Under normal conditions, the Udawalawe reservoir releases at least 32,000 acre-feet of water per day during the farming season. Udawalawe reservoir had released only 934 acre-feet of water to croplands on August 06, with 521 acre-feet of water from the right canal and 413 acre-feet of water from the left canal. After 545 acre-feet of water from Samanalawewa reservoir and Veli Oya was added to the Udawalawe reservoir that day.

        "date": "August 10, 2023 03:34 pm",
        "content": "At least 36 people have died as fast-moving wildfires tear through the Hawaiian island of Maui, officials say. The deaths in the resort city of Lahaina, the islands main tourist destination, came as strong winds from a distant hurricane fanned the flames. The fire there is one of several ongoing blazes that have burnt entire neighbourhoods to the ground. Thousands of people have been forced to evacuate their homes and a state of emergency has been declared. A huge search and rescue operation is under way, with some people still unaccounted for. We barely made it out in time, Kamuela Kawaakoa, who fled to an evacuation shelter on Tuesday with his partner and six-year-old son, told the Associated Press. It was so hard to sit there and just watch my town burn to ashes and not be able to do anything, he said. I was helpless. Five evacuation shelters have been opened on Maui and officials earlier said they were overrun with people. The island is a popular tourist destination and visitors have been urged to stay away. This is not a safe place to be, Hawaii Lt Governor Sylvia Luke told reporters. We have resources that are being taxed. Firefighters are still battling active fires, with helicopters dropping water on the blazes from above. As the firefighting efforts continue, 36 total fatalities have been discovered today amid the active Lahaina fire, the Maui county government said in a statement on Wednesday. Dozens of people have been injured since the fires began burning on Tuesday and hospitals on the island are treating patients for burns and smoke inhalation. Lahaina has been devastated by the fire and video showed the blaze tearing through the beachfront resort city. We just had the worst disaster Ive ever seen. All of Lahaina is burnt to a crisp. Its like an apocalypse, resident Mason Jarvi told Reuters. He showed the news agency images of the citys destroyed and blackened waterfront. Mr Jarvi said he suffered burns after riding through the flames on his bike to save his dog. The fires earlier drove people to jump into the citys harbour to escape the flames and smoke. Fourteen people were rescued after jumping in, officials said. On Wednesday, the strong winds caused by passing Hurricane Dora eased slightly meaning pilots were able to view the full scale of the damage. Images taken from above showed burnt cars littering the streets and smoke rising high above piles of rubble. Its horrifying. Ive flown here 52 years and Ive never seen anything come close to that, helicopter pilot Richard Olsten told the Associated Press. We had tears in our eyes. Climate change increases the risk of the hot, dry weather that is likely to fuel wildfires. The world has already warmed by about 1.2C since the industrial era began and temperatures will keep rising unless governments around the world make steep cuts to emissions. Source: BBC -Agencies",

        "title": "Sri Lanka aims for FTAs with ASEAN countries  President",
        "date": "August 10, 2023 03:54 pm",
        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe revealed that Sri Lankas intention to join the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) is poised to materialize following the conclusion of credit optimization initiatives. Additionally, the President announced plans to initiate negotiations for the establishment of free trade agreements with corresponding ASEAN member countries, the Presidents Media Division (PMD) reported. President Wickremesinghes statement underscores the countrys determination to bolster its economic connectivity within the broader Asian region. The President affirmed his alignment with the future vision of ASEAN for the Indo-Pacific area, pledging full support for the advancement of this strategic perspective, it said. These proposed collaborations highlight Sri Lankas commitment to fostering economic cooperation and trade linkages, which are poised to open new avenues for growth and development. The Presidents statements reaffirm the nations readiness to engage actively in regional economic partnerships to realize its economic ambitions. President Ranil Wickremesinghe made these remarks while addressing the 56th anniversary of the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN), Tuesday (08) at the Embassy of the Republic of Indonesia, Colombo, according to the PMD. The President reflected on Sri Lankas economic history and the decisions that had impacted the nations progress. He acknowledged the efforts of former President J. R. Jayawardena, his father and other influential figures who advocated for opening up the economy and joining ASEAN during its founding years as well as the Shenoy reforms for liberalization of the economy and to ensure the welfare program stayed within the needs. The President remarked that turning down the opportunity to join ASEAN led to a period of socialist economic policies and limited capital formations, hindering the countrys growth potential. The President further explained the circumstance that converted a source of profound regret. He said subsequently, over a span of three years, Sri Lanka transitioned into a socialist economic model, leading to the fragmentation of the capital formations, and has continued to progress in this trajectory. However, we find ourselves not entirely emancipated from the constraints imposed by that economic paradigm. At present, despite being positioned as one of the worlds major economies, poised to potentially ascend to the ranks of the fifth or fourth-largest expanding economies, we now confront the disheartening reality of shaking on the brink of bankruptcy after 55 years of existence. President Ranil Wickremesinghe praised the associations remarkable growth and success as one of the worlds largest economic blocks. The President also expressed regret that Sri Lanka had declined an invitation to join ASEAN in its early years, citing missed opportunities for economic prosperity. However, he highlighted a new policy approach to collaborate closely with ASEAN to enhance Sri Lankas position in the global arena. In light of Sri Lankas recent financial challenges and the need for rejuvenation, President Wickremesinghe expressed a renewed commitment to pursue closer ties with ASEAN. He acknowledged the strong cultural and historical connections between Southeast Asia and Sri Lanka, underscoring the importance of building on these relations to drive economic and political cooperation, it added. Amid the looming threat of bankruptcy, Sri Lanka has embraced the challenge head-on, aiming to move forward with inspiration drawn from proactive problem-solving approaches. This involves looking at the accomplishments of the ASEAN and enhancing collaboration with the organization. This strategic approach is firmly rooted in the governments policies. This approach, championed by the current administration, is expected to resonate with other governments as well. The nations enduring connections with Southeast Asia stand as evidence of its strong regional ties, perhaps only second to its affiliations with India and Maldives. Cultural bonds are exemplified through shared practices like Mahavihara Buddhism in countries such as Myanmar, Thailand, Cambodia, and Laos, and historical links like that between the Srivijaya Empire and Sri Lanka and Anuradhapura further reinforce these ties. Numerous historical interconnections further validate these relationships, including interactions with Malays and historical associations with the Srivijaya Empire. Even shared colonial history, notably during the Dutch Empires reign in places like Batavia (present-day Jakarta, Indonesia), adds another layer of commonality. This collective historical backdrop lays the groundwork for nurturing cultural, economic, and political relations, the PMD said. Consequently, as Sri Lanka faces impending financial challenges, it is actively strengthening its bonds with ASEAN nations. These alliances are poised to facilitate the pursuit of shared interests and the fostering of regional cooperation. In the pursuit of progress, Sri Lanka seeks not only to capitalize on its robust ties with Southeast Asia but also to build upon them for a mutually prosperous future. One of the key aspects of the new policy is the initiation of free trade agreements with ASEAN countries. President Wickremesinghe revealed that Sri Lanka has already forged a crucial trade agreement with Singapore and is actively negotiating with Thailand. The President also announced that Sri Lanka has applied to join the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), recognizing the potential of this vast trade block comprising major economies like China, Japan, and Korea. He emphasized that Sri Lankas economic focus should now turn towards the east, given the rapid development in that region. President Wickremesinghe has urged the Minister of Foreign Affairs to facilitate regular ministerial-level meetings with ASEAN countries to address mutual concerns and discuss the way forward. He stressed the importance of upholding the ASEAN outlook on the Indo-Pacific and supporting Indonesias maritime fulcrum concept. The President emphasized the need for unity and cooperation, especially in the face of challenges like climate change. Recognizing the urgency of the climate crisis, President Wickremesinghe called for joint efforts between ASEAN countries and Sri Lanka to combat climate change and explore the potential of the blue economy. President Ranil Wickremesinghe expressed gratitude for the invitation to the ASEAN anniversary event and reaffirmed Sri Lankas commitment to fostering closer ties with ASEAN and reiterated that collaboration and friendship among nations would be the driving force for shared progress and prosperity in the region. Meanwhile, the Indonesian Ambassador, Dewi Gustina Tobing, highlighted the significance of the ASEAN viewing Sri Lanka as a vital partner for regional cooperation. With a collective population exceeding 670 million, roughly 8.8 of the global populace, ASEAN represents the worlds third-largest market. The Ambassador emphasized the importance of fostering stronger ties between ASEAN and Sri Lanka. The aim is to promote people-to-people connections and create a closer link between the two regions, the PMD mentioned. Ambassador Tobing reiterated ASEANs aspiration for a peaceful, stable, and prosperous Indo-Pacific region. The organization seeks to establish an inclusive regional architecture that ensures the safety and security of all member nations. The envoy expressed ASEANs openness to engaging with countries interested in strengthening their presence in the Indo-Pacific. The organization is committed to collaborating with Sri Lanka to ensure the nation benefits from ASEANs development. Dynamic and multifaceted partnerships are recognized as pivotal in this pursuit. Ambassador Tobing emphasized that shared values, principles, and interests form the bedrock of ASEANs relations with countries worldwide. These include bolstering a rule-based international order to tackle common challenges spanning economic, security, health, environmental, cultural, and climate change aspects, the PMD added. In light of the 57th year of ASEANs existence, the envoy reaffirmed solidarity among member nations to collectively address challenges and create more opportunities for growth. The partnership between ASEAN and Sri Lanka is poised to flourish, evolving positively over the years and decades to come. Speaker Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena, Ministers Bandula Gunawardena, Keheliya Rambukwella, Vidura Wickramanayake, Nasir Ahmed, Jeevan Thondaman, Nalin Fernando, State Minister Taraka Balasuriya and other officials including Malaysian High Commissioner Badli Hisham Adam. , Ambassador of Thailand Poj Harnpol, Ambassador of Vietnam Ho Thi Thanh Truc, Ambassador of Myanmar Mr. U Han Thu, Sagala Ratnayake, Senior Adviser to the President on National Security and Chief of Presidential Staff and many dignitaries including the commanders of the three armed forces attended the event, according to the PMD.",

        "title": "Japan destroyer tests Sri Lanka shipyard with eye on future use - report",
        "date": "August 10, 2023 04:01 pm",
        "content": "Every summer, the Japanese Maritime Self-Defense Force (JMSDF) deploys a fleet of ships across the Indo-Pacific region to conduct joint training, visit ports and invite locals aboard. This year, that engagement deepened. One of the destroyers from the fleet, JS Samidare, has been making port calls that signal a greater commitment to the region. They include maintenance work at a Sri Lankan shipyard, the first time the JMSDF has serviced one of its vessels at an overseas port, and a visit to Indias Andaman and Nicobar Islands, which sit strategically at the mouth of the Malacca Strait. The summer deployments began in 2017 under the late former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. He had unveiled his Free and Open Indo-Pacific policy a year earlier, and the flotilla was a symbol of his new diplomatic vision. This summers moves signal an intent to expand the area and scope of operations for the JMSDF in the key region. The trigger for this deeper engagement? China, which for years has been expanding its engagement in ports that surround India, often described as its String of Pearls strategy. JS Samidare spent five days in Sri Lankas Colombo Dockyard and conducted maintenance work at the end of July. This is the first time for a JMSDF ship to undergo maintenance at an overseas shipyard, a spokesperson for the force told Nikkei Asia. There was nothing wrong with the ship, so I would describe this as maintenance rather than repair. Asked if the plan was to conduct periodic maintenance at the port in Colombo in the future, the spokesperson said, The aim this time was to verify whether Colombo Dockyard a ship maintenance company was fit to service ships. We checked the capabilities and adaptability as well as the management of the shipyard and we will decide future steps based on those assessments. Japanese shipbuilder Onomichi Dockyard took over Colombo Dockyard from a state-owned enterprise in 1993. On Aug. 2, the Samidare sailed to Port Blair Port for a four-day visit. No record can be found for a recent visit to the Andaman and Nicobar Islands by a JMSDF vessel, the spokesperson said. The port sits at one of the worlds most important chokepoints and is considered a key observation site from which to track Chinese submarines moving from the South China Sea to the Indian Ocean. The secretive boats have to surface when passing through the narrow patch of water between Malaysia and Indonesia, offering other navies a rare opportunity to track them. The port call comes after the Japan International Cooperation Agency agreed to provide India with 4.02 billion yen (28 million) for a power supply project in South Andaman, where Port Blair Port is located. The Indian government has, traditionally, carefully guarded against foreign access to military facilities on the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, said Tom Corben, a research fellow at the University of Sydneys United States Studies Centre (USSC). So its a strong signal of trust in Japan that New Delhi is willing to host visits from the JMSDF at Port Blair, and to accept Japanese investment in critical infrastructure that support these facilities. This port call also fits into a pattern of intensifying naval cooperation between the Quad partners in the Indian Ocean, Corben added, pointing to the four-way partnership between the U.S., Japan, India and Australia. In 2020, a U.S. Navy P-8 Poseidon, a long-range anti-submarine warfare and maritime surveillance aircraft, refueled at an Indian base in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands for the first time. Several visits by Australian and Indian patrol aircraft to each others facilities for joint operations took place in the last 18 months, Corben said. In June, a study group at USSC including Corben, published a report titled Bolstering the Quad: The case for a collective approach to maritime security, which called for the four partners to integrate their maritime logistics. The authors proposed that the Quad countries share resources and combine capabilities to be able to seamlessly refuel, resupply and repair ships and aircraft from any of its members, and foster the ability to do so at very short notice.

        "content": "Israeli airline Arkia has announced its plans to launch direct flights between Tel Aviv and Colombo, starting from October 31, foreign media reported. Reportedly, the direct flights are planned to depart Israel on Tuesdays, while flights from Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) in Katunayake take off for Tel Aviv on Wednesdays. Waruna Wilpatha, former ambassador of Sri Lanka to Israel, has told JNS, an Israeli newspaper, that he is pleased to see a project he initiated is coming to fruition. He stressed that it was next to impossible to promote tourism and increase trade between the two countries without direct air connectivity. The former Sri Lankan envoy further stated that he had worked tirelessly to initiate direct flights between Israel and Sri Lanka during the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020 and he was hoping to have them in place by October 2022 during the peak tourist season. Wilpatha, who was the Sri Lankan diplomat in Israel from 2019 until last February, told JNS that approximately 6,000 Sri Lankans live in Israel, with the majority of them working as caregivers for the elderly. Earlier this year, a special discussion regarding the commencement of direct passenger flights from Tel Aviv in Israel to Katunayake was held between the two nations at the Ministry of Ports Shipping  Aviation under the patronage of Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva. Representatives from the civil aviation authorities of Israel and Sri Lanka including Israels Air Transport Division Senior Director were in attendance.

        "date": "August 10, 2023 05:00 pm",
        "content": "Hailing the role of New Delhi in Sri Lankas debt restructuring, Japanese Ambassador to India Hiroshi Suzuki said that Indias issuance of financing assurances to the island nation at the time of its economic crisis was instrumental in accelerating the process of its debt restructuring. Ambassador Suzuki also said that Japan appreciates Indias engagement and forward-looking approach on the issue. He made these remarks at the INDIA-SRI LANKA-JAPAN Trilateral Cooperation Event co-hosted by NatStrat  a not-for-profit centre for research on strategic and security issues, Vivekananda International Foundation (VIF), Pathfinder Foundation and Confederation of Indian Industry (CII). Addressing the event, the Japanese envoy also highlighted the role of India, Japan and Sri Lanka in the Indo-Pacific region. When Prime Minister Kishida visited Delhi and gave an address on the new plan of the free and open Indo-Pacific, he highlighted South Asia as one of the major pillars, one of the priority regions in his new plan. And Japan attaches primary importance to its relations with Sri Lanka and India as indispensable partners in order to realize the vision, said Ambassador Suzuki. Commenting on Sri Lankas debt restructuring process, the Japanese envoy spoke about how Development Finance has been a major challenge for the Indo-Pacific region and Japan attaches importance to transparent and fair developmental assistance. In the Indo-Pacific region, there is a huge demand for development finance. Japan has been taking the position which attaches the highest priority to transparent and fair developmental assistance, and development finance, which abides by international rules and standards. More concretely, Japan has been pushing forward what is called quality infrastructure principles, which were indeed agreed upon by all the leaders of the G20 Presidents, and Prime Ministers when they gathered for the Osaka G20 Summit back in 2019. This high-quality infrastructure principle attaches importance to four major aspects. First is transparency, second is openness, third is economic viability and fourth, but not in least, debt sustainability. So, these are the four key items that Japan feels are important in providing both infrastructure and viable development assistance, he added. The Japanese envoy stated that in terms of debt relief, Japan attaches importance to international rules and status, adding how important it is to treat all creditors the same way. We place the highest priority on transparent and equitable debt restructuring where all creditor entities, creditors countries, and organizations participate. An equitable treatment among all creditors. If one country is favoured over another, then the entire debt restructuring will fall apart. Sri Lankan President has made it public that Sri Lankan govt will never treat any country more favourably than others and Japan highly appreciates the public commitment that President made that crystal clear, he said. Milinda Moragoda, the Sri Lanka High Commissioner also hailed the trilateral cooperation and said that given the amount of investment required, it hence becomes an important aspect. This I would see as the next stage of our Presidents Ranil Wickremesinghe visit to India. As you know the joint economic vision statement that was given between Prime Minister Modi and Wickremesinghe and outlined three key areas. One was connectivity, the second was economic integration and the third was investment. In that context, given the amount of investments that are required, trilateral cooperation becomes also an important aspect of it. So, in that context, Japan, India and Sri Lanka are working together. Japan and Sri Lanka have had a long association and so is India and Sri Lanka, said the Sri Lankan high commissioner. Today I think it symbolises this idea of Japan India and Sri Lanka coming together and to look at possible cooperation in the investments space, High Commissioner Moragoda added. When asked about the Chinese Submarine and its presence in the Indian Ocean region, the Sri Lankan envoy said the incident was some time ago and the Presidents visit focussed on economic integration. The submarine incident was some time ago. It was not a recent issue and at the moment, we are looking forward because the visit by the President was focused on economic cooperation. India supported Sri Lanka when we had a lot of difficulties and now we are looking at the economic recovery phase and how India and Sri Lanka can come together in that context, said High Commissioner Moragoda. -with inputs from agencies",

Deep concerns were raised in the country about the alleged substandard drug imports after an allergic reaction caused by an antibiotic called Ceftriaxone resulted in the death of a 21-year-old girl who was receiving treatment at the Peradeniya Teaching Hospital in July for indigestion issues. She had shown signs of an allergic reaction after being administered the second vial of Ceftriaxone which contained a dose of 1mg. It was reported that the young woman had not shown any signs of an allergic reaction after the first dose was administered. Days later, two other patients who were under medical care at the Kandy National Hospital too had developed allergic reactions to the antibiotic, after which the batch of the antibiotic used in the Kandy National Hospital and Peradeniya Teaching Hospital was withheld.",

        "date": "August 10, 2023 07:02 pm",
        "content": "More than 1 billion debt owed to India by Sri Lanka will undergo restructuring as part of the International Monetary Fund-led debt restructuring programme for the crisis hit South Asian country, Indian media reported on Thursday. The debt is part of the Line of Credit that the Government of India has extended to Sri Lanka over the years for undertaking various projects, primarily related to infrastructure building associated with roads, energy, water, housing projects, among others. India current exposure to Sri Lanka is about 3 billion. IMF is trying to come up with a resolution plan, where there may be some kind of haircut for the (international) lenders. We are not sure what kind of it is there, but we believe it is going to be common across the board, said N. Ramesh, Deputy Managing Director, EXIM Bank of India to ET Infra. Its about more than a billion (dollars), he said on the amount that Sri Lanka has utilized from the several Line of Credit extended by India and which will undergo some form of restructuring. EXIM Banks Policy Business, done on behalf of Government of India, facilitates project exports and supports development priorities in over 60 countries through Line of Credit and constitutes 52 of its loan portfolio. Ramesh outlined that the nature of the restructuring of debt owed to India by Sri Lanka is yet to be firmed up, outlining that much will depend on the final contours decided by the IMF. There are many types of restructuring possibilities out there. A particular lender may be interested in taking a haircut on principal. Lets say he gets back immediately 60 of his principal amount, he is okay with that but he doesnt want to reschedule his loan to a larger period. There can be another lender who instead of a 10-year loan, he is okay with a 15-year loan. So his repayment is stretched there, said Ramesh. ..haircuts can be of different nature. Some people may go in for retaining the principal amount and then go for different kinds of interest. But again, there will be one or two options given as a common modality to be adopted and all the lenders have to follow, he added. Haircut in the financial sector means the amount of cut that a lender takes after the loan to the borrower turns bad and the borrower is not in a position of repaying the entire amount or a percentage of it. In March, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund approved a 48-month extended arrangement under the Extended Fund Facility with an amount of 3 billion to support Sri Lankas economic policies and reforms, which are needed to put the country into a recovery path. According to reports, Sri Lankas current debt owed to foreign lenders including India currently stands at 41.5 billion. The island country defaulted on its international debt obligations in May 2022 after the country faced economic crisis on account of depleted foreign exchange reserves resulting in lack of essential commodities. Ramesh outlined that the focus of India remains on developing transport networks, both in rail and road in the island nation and India remains steadfast in supporting Sri Lanka economically. Its a neighbouring country, strategically important and you cannot be very resolute in your stand also. The Government of India has been very cooperative with respect to Sri Lanka. Even after the debt suspension, there was a 500 million (Line of Credit) given for petroleum products and another 50 million (Line of Credit) for fertilizers. We have been very patient with the money, said Ramesh. In July, the Sri Lankan parliament approved the countrys domestic debt restructuring plan, which will cover about 42 billion of debt and the step is expected to pave the way for the restructuring of debt owed to foreign creditors. Sri Lanka is expected to complete its debt restructuring process by September. Source - ET Infra --Agencies",

Speaking on matters concerning the devolution of powers, the TNA MPs highlighted that power devolution was successfully carried out in India and England, and thus urged that similar procedures be carried out in Sri Lanka as well. Responding to their requests, however, Minister Alles emphasised that albeit the devolution of powers having been successfully carried out in England recently, the social and political cultures of England vary vastly to those in Sri Lanka.

        "date": "August 10, 2023 09:55 pm",
        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe has emphasised the importance of capital, particularly financial and human, for driving growth. He noted that Sri Lankas historical capital formation efforts had been disrupted over the years, leading to current financial struggles. He pointed out that while the country had accumulated capital up to 2019, subsequent events such as the COVID-19 pandemic and economic downturn had led to a decline in financial strength. He drew parallels with other nations, pointing out how capital influx had fuelled their growth, and called for a focus on reorganizing and restructuring the financial system. Addressing the 36th Annual Conference of the Organization of Professional Associations (OPA) of Sri Lanka yesterday (09 Aug) at the Kingsbury Hotel Colombo, he commended the nations collective efforts in navigating through challenging times, comparing the present to the previous year and acknowledging the reversal of gloomy circumstances. He asserted that the country now holds renewed hope and prospects for the future. The Head of State also expressed his gratitude for the invitation and highlighted significant areas that will shape Sri Lankas future trajectory. President Wickremesinghe also underscored the necessity of moving forward with confidence and determination, highlighting the importance of constructive solutions over political distractions, cautioning against the detrimental effects of agitation without viable solutions, and mentioned the vacuum in political leadership that the nation experienced. He emphasised the need for consistent leadership to address pressing issues. However, the President praised those who stepped up to take on responsibilities and contribute to the countrys stabilization. The President also highlighted his acceptance of leadership during the crisis and the subsequent efforts to stabilize Sri Lanka both politically and economically. He acknowledged the cooperation of various parties and individuals in these endeavours, emphasizing the critical role played by those who united for the nations betterment. Turning to economic challenges, the President addressed the issue of domestic debt optimization and the potential sabotage of these efforts. He underscored the dire consequences if such endeavours were to fail, which would severely impact the nations banking sector and economy at large. Addressing the issue of human capital, the President highlighted the significance of education and training. He noted the departure of skilled individuals from the country and expressed concern over the loss of professionals to other nations. He emphasized the urgent need for the establishment of vocational training centres and universities to address the skills gap and meet the demands of a competitive economy. He outlined plans to collaborate with the private sector and institutions to create a robust framework for education and training and stressed the importance of creating an environment that encourages professionals to remain in Sri Lanka. While underscoring the importance of attracting investment, President Wickremesinghe highlighted the need for a competitive economy. He emphasized that Sri Lankas historical capital formation had faltered due to various reasons and underscored the importance of foreign investments and the Colombo financial zone to secure necessary funds. He stressed the role of a streamlined investment procedure and called for the development of a more appealing investment environment to compete with neighbouring countries. President Wickremesinghe also discussed the legislative changes being proposed, including the devolution of powers to provincial councils and streamlined procedures for new universities. He mentioned plans for the establishment of multiple institutions to cater to the evolving demands of various fields. He emphasized the importance of human resource development, especially in universities, and urged the participation of organizations like the OPA to ensure the required human resources for future growth. He emphasized that the key to Sri Lankas future success lies in the strategic management of financial and human capital in driving the countrys economic prosperity, marking them as pivotal factors for the nations future development to foster a thriving and competitive economy.",

        "title": "New mechanism to be introduced to reduce burden of prisons on Treasury",
        "date": "August 10, 2023 10:39 pm",
        "content": "State Minister of Justice and Prison Affairs Anuradha Jayaratne has revealed that discussions are underway pertaining to the establishment of a legal system for maintaining prisons in a way that does not burden the treasury. Accordingly, the Minister of State noted that four private institutions have shown their support for a programme to construct private sector companies in the prisons and employ the prisoners there, the Presidents Media Division (PMD) reported Jayaratne made these remarks during a press conference held at the Presidential Media Centre (PMC) on Thursday (10 Aug), themed Collective Path to a Stable Country. State Minister Anuradha Jayaratne further commented; As of today, the total number inmates in prisons are 28,468. It was also revealed that the number of drug-related offenders has increased rapidly. As per today 50.3 of the total inmates are people who were imprisoned for drug related offences. In some prisons about 65 are detained due to drug related offences. We observe a pattern of offenders being imprisoned for drug-related offenses repeatedly as they return to their regular environments following the completion of the sentence imposed by the court. As a result, attention has now been focused on guiding individuals toward a program that combines skills development and rehabilitation. The development of two centers is being discussed with the Minister of Health, Mr. Keheliya Rambukwella, in order to consolidate rehabilitation and health services for the Western and Southern provinces, which report the most drug-related prisoners. Also, the government incurs a cost of Rs. 3.9 billion on just the food expense of inmates. They are maintained by the society by bearing those expenses. Currently, the prisoners are cultivating 418 acres of land. We have asked for an additional 200 acres to boost that total. In this manner, we are trying to reduce the huge amount of money spent on food. Meanwhile, various people have accused the government of misusing the Prevention of Terrorism Act but only 40 inmates are currently in prison under the Prevention of Terrorism Act. 33 LTTE prisoners who were detained under the PTA have already been released. The lack of room in the prisons, however, is the most significant issue the Prison Department is now dealing with. There are about 29,000 prisoners despite the 13,000 capacity of the current facilities. Attention has also been given to the potential of changing the Bail Act for civil offenders and putting them under house arrest in an effort to alleviate this issue. The report of the committee appointed to look into the matter has now been received. It is therefore intended that the pertinent draft laws will be delivered to the Parliament as soon as feasible. Additionally, suspects may participate in court processes using digital technology (Virtual Courts concept) in any situation where it is not required for them to physically appear in court. Meanwhile, attention has also been focused on a program to establish private sector factories inside prisons and hire inmates. Four institutions have already expressed their agreement for that. The inmates will have the chance to be released into society as working people if the Prison Department and the prisoners can successfully run the factories. It is anticipated that an inmate who works in this capacity will receive Rs. 1400.00 in funding, while their family will receive Rs. 400500. So far 1120 inmates have been rehabilitated under the Amadivi Ridma program. With this, the inmates will be sent home on leave for 7-14 days and it will be considered whether they can be released on the basis of their good behavior. This also hopes to reintegrate them into society as good people. In the meantime, it should be emphasized that even though some accuse that there are spaces for various underworld activities in prisons, there is no chance for that. We have controlled all the spaces for such activities as much as possible. However, it must be said that if the prison officials try to suppress it through various pressures, there is no room for that either. A special security program has been implemented with the support of the Inspector General of Police for the safety of prison officers. Also, in addition to the prison officers, the Special Task Force and a group of non-prison officers deal with security. Bogambara prison has already been handed over to the Urban Development Authority. Also, the commercial value of the land where the Welikada prison is located is over 32 billion rupees. Taking this situation into consideration, 200 acres of land belonging to the Urban Development Authority in Horana has been acquired for the Prison Department. Instructions have been given to call for project reports not exceeding Rs. 18 billion for the construction of a prison in Horana. We hope to complete the project with all modern facilities through an international tender call. The new jail is about four times the size of the existing jail. Apart from this, it is hoped to promote the open-air prison system and introduce the geo-tag system for civil convicts. A discussion has now started on setting up a systematic, legal system that can be submitted to the Parliament to maintain the prisons without burdening the Treasury. It must be said that it is a different process than the story of the elite class being given the opportunity to get prison cells by paying money. Additionally, plans have been made to host a Prisoners Art Exhibition at the Public Library Auditorium in Colombo on September 12 to commemorate the National Prisoners Day. By doing this, we seek to offer value to their skills, even if they are imprisoned for a crime, the Minister said.",

        "content": "Customs authorities in Rotterdam have confiscated more than 8,000 kilograms (17,600 pounds) of cocaine, the largest seizure of the drug in the Netherlands, prosecutors said Thursday. The drugs had an estimated street value of 600 million euros (662 million), the Rotterdam Public Prosecution Service said in a statement. No arrests have been made yet in an investigation following the discovery, which was kept secret because of the ongoing probe. Prosecutors said the drugs, which have been destroyed, were discovered on July 13 hidden in a container of bananas from Ecuador. The announcement came the day after a presidential candidate known for speaking out against drug cartels and corruption in the South American nation was fatally shot at a political rally. The flourishing drug trade in Europe also is fueling violence and corruption on the continent, the European Union agency that monitors drugs and addiction said in its annual report in June. It said record amounts of cocaine are being seized in Europe, with 303 tons confiscated by EU member countries in 2021. Rotterdam and the Belgian port of Antwerp are now the main gateways for Latin American cocaine into the continent, it said. The expansion of the cocaine market has been accompanied by a rise in violence and corruption in the EU, with fierce competition between traffickers leading to a rise in homicides and intimidation. Among the victims in the Netherlands in recent years were a lawyer representing a witness in the trial of an alleged drug gangster and crime reporter Peter R. de Vries, who was a confidant of the witness. Unspecified threats to the heir to the Dutch throne, Princess Amalia, forced her last year to abandon student accommodation in Amsterdam and continue her studies from home. In Ecuador, drug traffickers have begun to use the countrys coastal ports and have unleashed a wave of violence not seen there in decades as rival gangs battle for control. Last month, the mayor of the port city of Manta was shot and killed. On July 26, President Guillermo Lasso declared a state of emergency covering two provinces and the countrys prison system in an effort to stem the violence. Source: Associated Press -Agencies",

        "date": "August 11, 2023 12:18 pm",
        "content": "Russia has successfully launched Luna 25, the countrys first lunar lander in 47 years. The uncrewed spacecraft lifted off from the Vostochny Cosmodrome in Amur Oblast, Russia. Hitching a ride aboard a Soyuz-2 Fregat rocket, Luna 25 took flight at 8:10 a.m. local time Friday, or 7:10 p.m. ET Thursday. Residents of a Russian village were temporarily evacuated Friday morning since there is a one in a million chance that one of Luna 25s rocket stages could fall there, according to Reuters. The spacecraft is expected to first enter an orbit around Earth before transferring to a lunar orbit and ultimately descending to the surface of the moon. Russias last lunar lander, Luna 24, landed on the moon on August 18, 1976. Luna 25 and Indias Chandrayaan-3 mission, which launched in mid-July, are both expected to land at the lunar south pole on August 23, and its a race to see which country will land first, according to Reuters. But Roscomos said the two missions are not expected to cause a problem for each other because their specific landing zones differ, Reuters reported. Luna 25s journey Luna 25, also called the Luna-Glob-Lander, will study the composition of the moons polar soil and the plasma and dust contained in the very thin lunar exosphere, or the moons scant atmosphere, for one year. The four-legged lander includes landing rockets, propellant tanks, solar panels, computers and a robotic arm equipped with a scoop to collect lunar samples, as well as a suite of instruments to study the samples and exosphere, according to NASA. Initially, Roscosmos and the European Space Agency planned to partner on Luna 25, as well as Luna 26, Luna 27 and the ExoMars rover. But that partnership ceased in April 2022 after Russias invasion of Ukraine, and the ESA Council moved to discontinue cooperative activities with Russia. The future of moon exploration Meanwhile, Chandrayaan-3, which includes a lander, rover and propulsion module, lifted off on July 14 and entered lunar orbit last weekend. The mission is Indias second attempt to land at the lunar south pole after Chandrayaan-2 crashed into the moon in September 2019. If successful, the latest mission would make India only the fourth country to achieve the complicated feat, behind the United States, the former Soviet Union and China. Once on the surface, Chandrayaan-3 will spend a couple of weeks conducting a series of scientific experiments to learn more about the moons composition. NASA plans to land a woman and a person of color on the moon for the first time at the lunar south pole in late 2025 during the Artemis III mission. The reason so many missions have been designed to explore this region of the moon is due to its potential resources. Deep, permanently shadowed craters at the lunar south pole may contain ice that could be used for drinking water, oxygen and fuel  a key consideration as agencies like NASA look to sustainably explore the moon for longer periods of time in the future. Were going to see several spacecraft, some perhaps from other nations, that are going to be landing on the south pole in the near future, said NASA Administrator Bill Nelson during a news conference Tuesday. Theres a renewed interest in the moon and of course its there because the potential of water. Were going back to learn to live in a deep space environment for long periods of time, so that we can go to Mars and return safely. When asked about the upcoming Luna 25 launch, Nelson said we wish them well, noting that NASA has had a cooperative relationship with its Russian counterpart dating back to the Soviet era since 1975.

        "title": "Chinas security ministry says alleged Chinese spy for CIA uncovered",
        "date": "August 11, 2023 01:19 pm",
        "content": "China has uncovered a Chinese national suspected of spying for the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), its state security ministry said on Friday, highlighting what it said were the risks and dangers of Chinese citizens being recruited abroad. The Chinese national surnamed Zeng, who had worked for a military industrial group, was recruited by a CIA agent based in Italy, the ministry said in a statement posted on its WeChat channel. Zeng was sent to Italy by the military industrial group for further studies and became acquainted with the CIA agent. Through dinner parties, outings and trips to the opera, the two developed a close relationship, with Zeng gradually becoming psychologically dependent on the CIA agent, the ministry said. After succeeding in shaking Zengs political stance, the CIA agent sought sensitive information about the Chinese military from Zeng, according to the statement. It did not say when the events took place. The statement did not specify Zengs gender but said the person was born in 1971 and the alleged CIA agent was named Seth. The U.S. embassy in Beijing did not respond to a Reuters request for comment. U.S.-Sino relations have soured in recent years over a range of issues including national security. Washington has accused Beijing of espionage and cyberattacks, a charge that China has rejected. China has also declared it is under threat from spies. In the name of national security, China earlier this month called on its citizens to participate in counter-espionage work, following an expansion of its anti-spying law in July, alarming the United States. Zeng was found to have signed an espionage agreement with the U.S. and had received training before returning to China, the ministry said. The alleged agent promised a huge amount of money and immigration to the U.S. for Zengs family in return for the information, the ministry said. After returning to China, Zeng had provided on numerous occasions core intelligence, and had pocketed funds for the efforts, it said. Coercive measures, which normally means detention, have been taken against Zeng, according to the statement. Source - Reuters - Agencies",

        "title": "President unveils ambitious plans for agricultural modernization",
        "date": "August 11, 2023 01:44 pm",
        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe on Thursday (Aug. 10) unveiled an ambitious plan aimed at revolutionizing Sri Lankas agricultural sector. The proposed initiative involves the establishment of an Agricultural Modernization Task Force, which is set to encompass all crops and sectors within the industry, according to Presidents Media Division (PMD). Addressing the critical need for collaboration between the government and the private sector, the task force is expected to pave the way for comprehensive agricultural reforms. The task force will include representatives from respective government departments and selected private sector entities, reflecting the need for a multifaceted approach. PMD says President Wickremesinghes vision extends beyond crop cultivation to encompass animal husbandry in due course. In the pursuit of this ambitious agricultural modernization program, the President has highlighted the critical importance of modernizing the Agricultural Support System as a foundational step. He also underscored the importance of a comprehensive overhaul of the support mechanisms to achieve the envisioned transformation in the agricultural sector. PMD says the Presidents call for modernization extends to various facets of the agricultural support system, including technical expertise, market linkages, and the adoption of advanced technologies. He acknowledged that a re-imagined support system would play a pivotal role in empowering farmers to embrace modern practices and technologies, thereby boosting productivity and sustainability. An integral aspect of this initiative is said to be the incorporation of resources and expertise from the Ministries of Agriculture, Plantations, and Irrigation as well as Mahaweli Authority. This consolidation, combined with the participation of nine provincial councils, seeks to address challenges comprehensively with the assistance of the respective Governors. PMD noted that the involvement of the private sector will further diversify expertise and resources. President Wickremesinghes plan extends beyond governmental agencies, and seeks to integrate universities and research institutions into the modernization endeavour, it added. The Head of State has emphasized the importance of breaking down barriers and forming specialized groups within the task force. The goal is to address specific subjects such as paddy cultivation, Mahaweli development and vegetable production. Expertise from individuals will be instrumental in guiding these efforts. The President has articulated this sweeping agricultural modernization strategy which aimed at transforming Sri Lankas farming sector during an agriculture modernisation meeting held at the Presidential Secretariat on Thursday. Moreover, President Wickremesinghe advocated the diversification of efforts across various sectors within agriculture, urging private sector involvement in fields such as paddy and vegetable cultivation. He proposed tailored collaboration to optimize outcomes and promote growth. In addition, President Wickremesinghe highlighted the need for a revamped paddy purchasing system. He stressed the importance of ensuring value for money and optimal utilization of resources. The President has underscored that the funds expended on paddy purchases and related endeavours could have been redirected to provide essential sustenance to the population. A key focus of the Presidents discussion was on revamping Sri Lankas paddy purchasing system. President Wickremesinghe stressed the importance of prudent resource allocation and optimal utilization of funds. He highlighted potential partnerships with established companies in agriculture and emphasized the need for a unified approach. To ensure successful implementation of the modernization strategy, President Wickremesinghe urged active private sector participation. He underscored the potential for substantial gains in both productivity and sustainability by involving private enterprises. He hinted at potential collaborations with international partners, like Thailand, to bolster the modernization drive and underlines the commitment to sourcing innovative solutions from around the globe. PMD explained that President Wickremesinghes vision emphasizes the need for rapid modernization that not only elevates agricultural productivity but also addresses pressing concerns related to climate change. His call to consider climate change targets in the process of modernization reflects a forward-thinking approach that seeks not only to enhance productivity but also to safeguard the delicate balance of our ecosystem. His vision encapsulates the urgency of addressing climate challenges while concurrently modernizing agricultural practices. In addition, President Wickremesinghe signalled a transformation of the 567 agrarian service centres islandwide into comprehensive farmer service hubs. He proposed the hiring of machinery from these centres to aid smallholder farmers who lack access to modern equipment. President Wickremesinghe underscored the importance of balancing regulations and private sector engagement in this endeavour. Wrapping up his speech, President Wickremesinghe reiterated his commitment to supporting agriculture as a potent avenue for national development. He called for coordinated efforts, innovative strategies and a unified approach to ensure the success of the modernization drive. The Presidents comprehensive vision seeks to pave the way for a vibrant, sustainable and dynamic agricultural sector in Sri Lanka. -PMD",

        "date": "August 11, 2023 03:34 pm",
        "content": "Indias Prime Minister Narendra Modi has defeated a no-confidence vote in the parliament after a three-day debate. His government was not expected to lose the vote as his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and its allies have a majority. Mr Modi criticised the vote as an attempt by opposition parties to defame India. Opposition leaders say the vote was moved to force him to speak on the ethnic clashes in Manipur state. More than 150 people have died and tens of thousands have been displaced in Manipur since May, when clashes broke out between the majority Meitei group and the tribal Kuki minority. Mr Modi publicly addressed the violence weeks later, after a video that showed two women being paraded naked by a mob sparked global outrage. The parliament session, which began on 20 July, has been marked by protests from the opposition which demanded that Mr Modi address the house on the violence in the state. On Thursday, before the no-trust vote, the Opposition walked out of the parliament after Mr Modi failed to mention Manipur over an hour into his speech. Late into his two-hour speech, Mr Modi said the federal and the state government were working together to bring back peace in the troubled state. I also want to tell the people of Manipur that the country is with you, this house is with you. We will join hands and find a solution to this challenge together, he said. He also accused the Opposition of using Manipur for political games. They have no faith in the people of India, in the abilities of India, Mr Modi said. They have tried in vain to break the self-confidence of Indians with this no-confidence vote. This is the second time that Mr Modis government has defeated a no-confidence motion since it came to power in 2014. In 2018, a lawmaker had moved a motion over the issue of granting a special category status to southern Andhra Pradesh state. It was defeated after a 12-hour debate. Source: BBC -Agencies",

        "content": "Issues pertaining to the laying of power cables through a private estate in Siripagama, Ratnapura to connect the Southern Province to the main transmission line of the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) have been resolved, CEB reported. Accordingly, the Artigala family, owners of the tea estate in question, has given their consent without claiming any compensation from CEB or the Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL), CEB General Manager Rohan Seneviratne revealed. Thus, the CEB will be able to complete the necessary work on the electricity transmission route from Polpitiya, Laxapana to Hambantota within six days Seneviratne said. The family has granted permission for the move during the conciliation process which took place today (11 Aug) pursuant to the regulations published by the PUCSL in the Gazette Extraordinary dated 25 January 2015, under Section 53 of the Electricity Act No. 20 of 2009. The matter was referred to the PUCSL on 02 August and was resolved within eight days. Speaking to the media afterward, Seneviratne commended the Artigala family, saying Members of the Artigala family approved this move on behalf of the government and the population in the South, without asking for any compensation. This is something we should all value because the transmission line is going through their private estate. The issue had originated after the land owners initially demanded a compensation of Rs. 48 million following a private estimate and then Rs. 9.6 million pursuant to Asian Development Bank (ADB) criteria, while the CEB had agreed to pay Rs. 1.6 million in compensation for the loss of land to lay a 630-meter power cable which would allow the Southern Province to be connected to CEBs main transmission line.",

By enhancing the Diyagama Mahinda Rajapaksa Sports Complex, the lawmaker said it is intended to construct the Sports University, which is expected to recognize outstanding athletes both locally and at the school level and provide the necessary facilities to advance their abilities. He expressed these views on Friday (Aug. 11) during a press conference themed Collective Path to a Stable Country held at the Presidential Media Centre (PMC). The state minister added that the National Sports Council has been established, putting an end to allegations of political interference in the selection of athletes for international sports competitions. He assured that the new National Sports Council, which would include seasoned athletes and experienced professionals, will contribute to the development of a robust sports culture in the nation. Dissanayaka also vowed to take steps to restart the National Youth Sports Festival and the Thurunu Shakthi program. State Minister Rohana Dissanayaka further commented; The Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports is doing a wide range of work to improve the sporting abilities of the youth of this country to raise them to the national and international level. President Ranil Wickremesinghe is a leader who has high hopes for the youth of this country. His contribution to the nations youth by founding the National Youth Service Council in 1979 deserves to be remembered. The two main institutions under our Ministry are the National Youth Service Council and the National Youth Corps. Every Regional Secretariat of this nation has a youth service officer assigned to them under the National Youth Service Council to handle youth-related issues. The National Youth Corps is a program that has been put in place to enhance the talents of young people in this country who have left school between the ages of 18 and 29 in order to create a perfect youth generation with abilities. They are also given knowledge of various languages including Korean and Japanese. Also, in the recent past, various issues have arisen due to political interference in the selection of athletes for international competitions. Therefore, it must be said that the step taken to appoint the National Sports Council is a very important one. The National Sports Council consists of veteran athletes like Arjuna Ranatunga and Susanthika Jayasinghe, who are experienced sports personalities who have an understanding of the countrys sports. It has paved the opportunity to make relevant selections through appropriate levels in getting athletes to participate in international competitions. Therefore, today no one can make accusations about political interference in these affairs. 66 of the 72 sports federations in this country are currently in operation. In every sports federation in this country, another rival team is always vying for control. I request such teams to give the opportunity to the teams that can play and support the development of sports in this country.",

        "content": "Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in his speech in the Parliament during the No-Confidence debate on August 10, mentioned the island of Katchatheevu. Hitting out at Rahul Gandhi for his now-expunged Bharat Mata remarks, PM Modi said it was the Indira Gandhi government that gave away Katchatheevu to Sri Lanka in 1974. Katchatheevu is an island between Tamil Nadu and Sri Lanka. Somebody gave it to another country. It happened under the leadership of Indira Gandhi, he said. Wasnt that part of Maa Bharati there? he quipped. Today a part of Sri Lanka, Katchatheevu remains a hot-button political issue in Tamil Nadu, for politicians across the aisle. Just recently, ahead of Sri Lankan President Ranil Wickremesinghes visit to New Delhi, Tamil Nadu Chief Minister MK Stalin wrote to PM Modi requesting him to retrieve the island. The transfer of Katchatheevu to Sri Lanka, by the Union government, without the state governments consent, has deprived Tamil Nadu fishermens rights and adversely impacted their livelihoods, Stalins letter said. Where is the island of Katchatheevu? Katchatheevu is a 285-acre uninhabited speck in the Palk Strait, between India and Sri Lanka. It is no more than 1.6 km in length and slightly over 300m wide at its broadest point. It lies northeast of Rameswaram, about 33km from the Indian coast. It is about 62km southwest of Jaffna, at the northern tip of Sri Lanka, and 24km away from the inhabited Delft Island, belonging to Sri Lanka. The only structure on the island is an early 20th-century Catholic shrine  St. Anthonys Church. During an annual festival, Christian priests from both India and Sri Lanka conduct the service, with devotees from both India and Sri Lanka making the pilgrimage. This year, 2,500 Indians made the journey to Katchatheevu from Rameswaram for the festival. Katchatheevu is not suited for permanent settlement as there is no source of drinking water on the island. What is the islands history? The island is relatively new in the geological timescale, being the product of a 14-century volcanic eruption. In the early medieval period, it was controlled by the Jaffna kingdom of Sri Lanka. In the 17th century, control passed to the Ramnad zamindari based out of Ramanathapuram, about 55km northwest of Rameswaram. It became part of the Madras Presidency during the British Raj. But in 1921, both India and Sri Lanka, at the time British colonies, claimed Katchatheevu in order to determine fishing boundaries. A survey marked Katchatheevu in Sri Lanka, but a British delegation from India challenged this, citing ownership of the island by the Ramnad kingdom. This dispute was not settled until 1974. What is the agreement now? In 1974, Indira Gandhi made attempts to settle the maritime border between India and Sri Lanka, once and for all. As a part of this settlement, known as the Indo-Sri Lankan Maritime Agreement, Indira Gandhi ceded Katchatheevu to Sri Lanka. At the time, she thought the island had little strategic value and that ceasing Indias claim over the island would deepen its ties with its southern neighbour. Moreover, as per the agreement, Indian fishermen were still allowed to access Katchatheevu hitherto. Unfortunately, the issue of fishing rights was not ironed out by the agreement. Sri Lanka interpreted Indian fishermens right to access Katchatheevu to be limited to rest, drying nets and for visit to the Catholic shrine without a visa. Another agreement in 1976, during the period of Emergency in India, barred either country from fishing in the others Exclusive Economic Zone. Again, Katchatheevu lay right at the edge of the EEZs of either country, retaining a degree of uncertainty with regard to fishing rights. How did the Sri Lankan Civil War impact Katchatheevu? However, between 1983 and 2009, the border dispute remained on the back burner as a bloody civil war raged in Sri Lanka. With the Sri Lankan naval forces preoccupied with their task of cutting off supply lines of the LTTE based out of Jaffna, incursions by Indian fishermen well into Sri Lankan waters were commonplace. Bigger Indian trawlers were especially resented as they would not only tend to overfish but also damage Sri Lankan fishing nets and boats. In 2009, the war with the LTTE ended, and things dramatically changed. Colombo beefed up its maritime defences, and turned its focus to Indian fishermen. Facing a depletion of marine resources on the Indian side, they would frequently enter Sri Lankan waters as they had been doing for years, but finally began facing consequences. To date, the Sri Lankan navy routinely arrests Indian fishermen and there have been many allegations of custodial torture and death. The demand for Katchatheevu is revived each time such an incident happens. What is Tamil Nadus position on Katchatheevu? Katchatheevu was given away to Sri Lanka without consulting the Tamil Nadu state assembly. At the time itself, there were vehement protests against Indira Gandhis move, citing the historical control of the Ramnad Zamindari over the island and the traditional fishing rights of Indian Tamil fishermen. In 1991, in the aftermath of Indias disastrous intervention in the Sri Lankan Civil War, the Tamil Nadu Assembly again sought retrieval of Katchatheevu and restoration of fishing rights of Tamil fishermen. Since then, Katchatheevu has perennially come up in Tamil politics. In 2008, then AIADMK supremo, the late J. Jayalalitha, filed a petition in court saying Katchatheevu could not be ceded to another country without a constitutional amendment. The petition argued the 1974 agreement had affected traditional fishing rights and livelihoods of Indian fishermen. After becoming chief minister in 2011, she moved a resolution in the State Assembly and, in 2012, went to the Supreme Court asking her petition be expedited in the wake of increasing arrests of Indian fishermen by Sri Lanka. However, the Union governments position on Katchatheevu has largely remained unchanged. It has argued that since the island had always been under dispute, no territory belonging to India was ceded nor sovereignty relinquished. While the BJP, especially the partys Tamil Nadu unit, has been vocal in its demand for retrieving Katchatheevu for India, even the Narendra Modi government has done little to actually act on Tamil politicians demands  there is little it can do. As then-Attorney General Mukul Rohtagi had told the Supreme Court in 2014: Katchatheevu went to Sri Lanka by an agreement in 1974 How can it be taken back today? If you want Katchatheevu back, you will have to go to war to get it back. Source: Indian Express",

        "date": "August 12, 2023 08:03 am",
        "content": "The death toll from the Maui wildfires rose 67 on Friday as search teams combed through the smoldering ruins of Lahaina and Hawaiian officials sought determine to how the inferno spread so rapidly through the historic resort town with little warning. The fires became the deadliest natural disaster in the states history, surpassing that of a tsunami that killed 61 people on the Big Island of Hawaii in 1960, a year after Hawaii joined the United States. Officials have warned that search teams with cadaver dogs could still find more dead from the fire that torched 1,000 buildings and left thousands homeless, likely requiring many years and billions of dollars to rebuild. Three days after the disaster, it remained unclear whether some residents had received any warning before the fire engulfed their homes. The island includes emergency sirens intended to warn of natural disasters and other threats, but they did not appear to have sounded during the fire. I authorized a comprehensive review this morning to make sure that we know exactly what happened and when, Hawaii Governor Josh Green told CNN, referring the warning sirens. Officials have not offered a detailed picture of precisely what notifications were sent out, and whether they were done via text message, email or phone calls. Green described multiple, simultaneous challenges, with telecommunications down and firefighters concentrating on other major wildfires when the greatest threat to Lahaina arose. In any event, he said, We will do all that we can to find out how to protect our people more going forward. Maui County Fire Chief Bradford Ventura said at a Thursday press conference that the fires speed made it nearly impossible for frontline responders to communicate with the emergency management officials who would typically provide real-time evacuation orders. They were basically self-evacuating with fairly little notice, he said, referring to residents of the neighborhood where the fire initially struck. County Mayor Richard Bissen told NBCs Today show on Friday that he did not know whether sirens went off but said the fire moved extraordinarily quickly. I think this was an impossible situation, he said. The disaster began unfolding just after midnight on Tuesday when a brush fire was reported in the town of Kula, roughly 35 miles (56 km) from Lahaina. About five hours later that morning, power was knocked out in Lahaina, according to residents. In updates posted on Facebook that morning, Maui County said the Kula fire had consumed hundreds of acres of pastureland, but that a small three-acre (1.2-hecatre) brush fire that cropped up in Lahaina had been contained. By that afternoon, however, the situation had turned more dire. At around 3:30 p.m., according to the countys updates, the Lahaina fire suddenly flared up. Some residents began evacuating while people, including hotel guests, on the towns west side were instructed to shelter in place. In the ensuing hours, the county posted a series of evacuation orders on Facebook as the fire spread through the town. Some witnesses said they had little advance notice, describing their terror when the blaze consumed Lahaina in what seemed a matter of minutes. Several people were forced to leap into the Pacific Ocean to save themselves. The Lahaina evacuation was complicated by its coastal location next to hills, meaning there were only two ways out, at best, said Andrew Rumbach, a specialist in climate and communities at the Urban Institute in Washington. This is the nightmare scenario, said Rumbach, a former urban planning professor at the University of Hawaii. A fast-moving fire in a densely populated place with difficult communications, and not a lot of good options in terms of evacuations. County officials began allowing Lahaina residents back to their homes on Friday, even though much of Mauis western side remained without power and water. But the long traffic jam on the Kuihelani Highway crawled to a halt after an accident killed a pedestrian and led officials to close the highway in both directions. Volunteers formed human chains on Friday afternoon at Maalaea Harbor to transfer infant formula, diapers, clothes, fuel and other supplies onto boats. Boat captains planned to sail around to the fire-affected areas and bring the supplies to the beach on jetskis, seconded from the areas tourism industry, as the waters were choppy and docks had been damaged by the fires. The Maui blazes are the latest wildfires that have struck this summer around the globe. Fires forced tens of thousands of people in Greece, Spain, Portugal and other parts of Europe to evacuate, while in western Canada smoke from a series of severe fires blanketed a vast swath of the U.S. Midwest and East Coast.

The committee, chaired by the Director of the Medical Research Institute (MRI) Dr. Dedunu Dias, consisted of six members including Prof. Jeewandara. Deep concerns were raised in the country about the alleged substandard drug imports after an allergic reaction caused by an antibiotic called Ceftriaxone resulted in the death of a 21-year-old girl who was receiving treatment at the Peradeniya Teaching Hospital in July for indigestion issues. She had shown signs of an allergic reaction after being administered the second vial of Ceftriaxone which contained a dose of 1mg. It was reported that the young woman had not shown any signs of an allergic reaction after the first dose was administered. Days later, two other patients who were under medical care at the Kandy National Hospital too had developed allergic reactions to the antibiotic, after which the batch of the antibiotic used in the Kandy National Hospital and Peradeniya Teaching Hospital was withheld.",

        "date": "August 12, 2023 10:43 pm",
        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe has agreed to establish a Task Force to address the multifaceted challenges faced by Sri Lankas plantation communities, and to use the Indian grant of Rs. 3 billion towards bettering their livelihoods. Taking to Twitter, Minister of Water Supply and Estate Infrastructure Development Jeevan Thondaman revealed that this was decided at a meeting with the Head of State held at the Presidential Secretariat on Friday (11 Aug). In a significant step towards advancing the well-being of plantation communities, President Ranil Wickremesinghe and I, concluded a pivotal meeting at the Presidential Secretariat yesterday. This meeting underscored our shared commitment to address pressing issued and introduced transformative solution to plantation communities, he said. Accordingly, several matters of concern, including the utilization of the Indian grant, land ownership and wage disparities were discussed. Speaking on the utilisation of the Indian grant of Rs. 3 billion, Thondaman stated that it was agreed between him and the President that the money be used to catalyse substantive and sustainable changes within plantation communities. Meanwhile, pertaining to the land-related issues faced by the plantation communities, the Minister revealed that swift action will be taken to ensure rightful ownership and security for homeowners, while a transparent mechanism for land ownership is set to be introduced in a bid to reinforce property rights for plantation communities. With a pragmatic understanding of last years inflation crisis, I am embarking on pursuing a wage hike for estate workers. The Rs. 1000 daily wage is grossly inadequate and pushes plantation workers deeper into poverty. We will also commence crafting a new revenue-sharing model that strikes a balance between workers livelihoods and the sustainability of companies. Collaborative prosperity is our objective, Thondaman said with regards to the wage disparities, adding that the pending EPF and ETF payments owed by the government to estate workers will also be resolved. Furthermore, in a bid to enhance the level of education provided to students of the upcountry regions, both the Minister and President Wickremesinghe have agreed to resolve the matter with new teaching appointments and tailored training programmes. Meanwhile, Minister Thondaman also proposed that another meeting be convened, with all upcountry MPs from all parties and communities to address issues faced by the plantation community, on account of the fact that all upcountry MPs belonging to the Opposition had skipped yesterdays meeting to attend another event.",

        "title": "Death toll from Maui fires hits at least 80, damages at billions of dollars",
        "date": "August 13, 2023 07:54 am",
        "content": "(Reuters) - The scale of the Maui wildfires destruction came into sharper focus on Saturday, as officials warned the death toll of 80 would likely rise and search teams with cadaver dogs sifted through the charred ruins of Lahaina looking for more victims. The cost to rebuild the historic resort town was estimated at 5.5 billion, according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), after the fast-moving flames consumed more than 1,000 buildings and leveled almost the entire town. Officials vowed to examine the states emergency notification systems after some residents questioned whether more could have been done to warn people before the fire overtook their homes. Some were forced to wade into the Pacific Ocean to escape. Sirens stationed around the island - intended to warn of impending natural disasters - never sounded, and widespread power and cellular outages hampered other forms of alerts. The states attorney general, Anne Lopez, said she was launching a review of the decision-making both before and during the fire, while Governor Josh Green told CNN he had authorized a review of the emergency response. Local officials have described a nightmarish confluence of factors, including communications network failures, powerful wind gusts from an offshore hurricane and a separate wildfire dozens of miles away, that made it nearly impossible to coordinate in real time with the emergency management agencies that would typically issue warnings and evacuation orders. The death toll made the inferno, which erupted on Tuesday, Hawaiis worst natural disaster in history, surpassing a tsunami that killed 61 people in 1960, a year after Hawaii became a U.S. state. Touring Lahaina on Saturday, Green said the number of dead would undoubtedly rise. Our focus now is to reunite people where we can, and to get them housing and get them health care, and then turn to rebuilding, he said. RAPID ADVANCE Authorities began allowing residents back into west Maui on Friday, although the fire zone in Lahaina remained barricaded. Officials warned there could be toxic fumes from smoldering areas and said search operations were continuing. Its going to be sad to get down there, said Za Dacruz, 33, as he waited on Friday in a traffic jam to try to return to Lahaina. Were just looking for everyone to be alive, to be safe - thats all were trying to do. And the rest? Well go from there. Hundreds of people were still missing, though a precise count was not clear. At a family assistance center in Kahului, June Lacuesta said he was trying to locate nine relatives who had not been heard from since Tuesday. When I see Lahaina town itself, I cannot describe the feelings I get, said Lacuesta, who was headed to a church shelter next to continue his search. The disaster began just after midnight on Tuesday when a brush fire was reported in the town of Kula, roughly 35 miles (56 km) from Lahaina. About five hours later, power was knocked out in Lahaina. In updates posted on Facebook that morning, Maui County said a three-acre (1.2-hectare) brush fire cropped up in Lahaina around 6:30 a.m. but had been contained by 10 a.m. Subsequent updates were focused on the Kula fire, which had burned hundreds of acres and forced some local evacuations. But at around 3:30 p.m., according to the countys updates, the Lahaina fire flared up. Some residents began evacuating while people, including hotel guests, on the towns west side were instructed to shelter in place. In the ensuing hours, the county posted a series of evacuation orders on Facebook, though it was not clear whether residents were receiving them as people frantically fled the fast-advancing flames. Some witnesses said they had little warning, describing their terror as the blaze destroyed the town around them in what seemed to be a matter of minutes. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "date": "August 13, 2023 09:43 am",
        "content": "Minister of Agriculture Mahinda Amaraweera has raised concerns over the disparity in the distribution of water for cultivation, stating that although it has been five days since water from the Samanalawewa Reservoir was released to the Udawalawe Reservoir, certain farmlands are yet to receive any water. Speaking further in this regard, the Minister said that he intends to bring to the Cabinets attention the severe crop damage in the Angunakolapelessa area, on account of the lack of water. Meanwhile, Amaraweera also revealed that President Ranil Wickremesinghe intends to implement a programme which would allow for all reservoirs to be controlled from one place. On 08 August, authorities commenced releasing water from the Samanalawewa reservoir to the Udawalawe reservoir for agricultural purposes. According to State Minister of Power  Energy D.V. Chanaka, water is being released at a rate of 3.5 million cubic meters per day for three days. The active water capacity of the Udawalawe reservoir, which has a total water capacity of 217,800 acre-feet, had dropped to 956 acre-feet as of Monday morning (Aug 07). This is merely 0.45 of the full water capacity of the water body. Under normal conditions, the Udawalawe reservoir releases at least 32,000 acre-feet of water daily during the farming season. However, the water body had released only 934 acre-feet of water to croplands on Sunday (Aug 06), with 521 acre-feet of water from the right canal and 413 acre-feet of water from the left canal. According to the Mahaweli Authority, a total of 545 acre-feet of water from Samanalawewa reservoir and Veli Oya was added to the Udawalawe reservoir on Sunday. Internal sources of the Mahaweli Authority revealed that at least 800 acres of paddy fields and 100 hectares of additional crops were lost as a result of the insufficient amounts of water provided from the Udawalawe reservoir to croplands.",

        "date": "August 13, 2023 10:47 am",
        "content": "At least four people were killed and three others injured in a house explosion Saturday in Plum, a suburb of Pittsburgh. The explosion destroyed three structures and damaged at least a dozen others, authorities said. An eighth person remains missing. A little before 10:30 a.m. Eastern time Saturday, 911 dispatchers received a call that multiple houses were on fire due to an explosion. Responding officers and firefighters arrived to find people trapped under the debris, Allegheny County officials reported. Four people were later confirmed dead in the incident, Allegheny County officials reported on social media. Three others were hospitalized, two in stable condition and one in critical condition. An eighth person remains unaccounted for, county officials said. County spokesperson Amie Downs said emergency responders reported people trapped under debris after one house apparently exploded and two others were engulfed in flames. Crews from at least 18 fire departments were working to douse the flames with the help of water tankers from Allegheny and Westmoreland counties. Officials told reporters at the scene that they dont know exactly who was home and who may have had visitors at the time of the explosion, so they cant give an exact number of people unaccounted for. The name of the person killed will be released by the county medical examiners office. The cause of the explosion is under investigation. Plum and county law enforcement, as well as the county fire marshals office, are investigating, and the state public utilities commission and local utilities were also at the scene. More than 20 firefighters were evaluated, many for heat exhaustion. George Emanuele, who lives three houses down from the home that exploded, told the Tribune-Review that he and a neighbor went to the home before the fire got out of control, where they found a man laying in the backyard and dragged him away from the scene. Rafal Kolankowski, who lives a few houses down, told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette that the explosion broke the windows in his house and knocked him and his wife to the ground. After recovering and checking on his son, he went outside where he said a woman told him another woman had been upstairs and a man was in the basement. The other woman later emerged covered in white ash, but the individual in the basement had not yet exited, he said. Its just tragic, I mean, it looks like a war zone  it looks like a bomb hit our neighborhood and its just unfortunate, Kolankowski said. I was just with some of the neighbors yesterday, right, and now this happens. Jeremy Rogers, who lives two doors down, told the paper he had been out shopping when he got an alert about a problem at his house and saw all sorts of stuff flying around. His family was able to get out safely, and he was allowed to go in quickly to rescue his dog. However, he wasnt able to get the familys three cats and hopes they are all right.

        "date": "August 13, 2023 07:22 pm",
        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe underscored the imperative to fortify the nations economy, ensuring that forthcoming generations are spared from enduring the unfortunate period that both the country and its people have weathered in the past two years. These remarks were made during his participation in the 150th Anniversary celebration of St. Thomas College in Matale today (13 Aug). President Wickremesinghe highlighted that resolving the countrys economic challenges goes beyond the success of the debt optimization programme, and emphasised the need to promptly initiate an economy-building strategy guided by sound decisions. He cautioned that failure to proactively adopt a new program would inevitably result in the country facing another economic hurdle within a decade. The President expressed his vision of propelling the country forward through comprehensive modernization. To achieve this, he announced the establishment of the Technology Promotion Council and the Digital Transformation Commission, aimed at accelerating the nations digital evolution. In an unprecedented event, President Wickremesinghe visited St. Thomas College in Matale, unveiling a commemorative plaque that marked the institutions 150th Anniversary. He also graciously posed for a group photograph with the Alumni Association. During the same occasion, the President also conferred certificates upon students who secured the top position in the district during the general education certificate examination. Following is the speech delivered by President Ranil Wickremesinghe at this event; It has been a century and a half since the inception of St. Thomas College in Matale. During its establishment, the country relied on a plantation-based economy with a significant focus on coffee cultivation. However, within a few years, the coffee industry collapsed, causing a severe economic downturn and depriving the government of its revenue stream. The economy struggled until the introduction of tea and rubber cultivation, which revitalized the nations financial standing. As the 150th Anniversary of St. Thomas College in Matale is commemorated today, the country finds itself grappling with an ongoing economic crisis. The previous years economic turmoil left deep impacts on the nations economic, social, and political landscapes. During that period, the prospect of recovery seemed bleak. A poignant example of this was the lack of volunteers to assume the role of Prime Minister after Mr. Mahinda Rajapaksas resignation. Typically, such vacancies are eagerly pursued, but in this case, no one stepped forward. Taking up the mantle of the presidency, I assumed responsibility, formed a cabinet, and embarked on finding both short-term and long-term solutions to address the economic crisis. Through decisive actions, we managed to eliminate the prevalent queues that had become emblematic of the nations struggles. The outcomes of our governments decisions in September, January, and April of the previous year have been embraced positively by the populace. As this year draws to a close, we hold the belief that our nation can overcome bankruptcy by successfully executing the credit appreciation program. Achieving this necessitates stringent control over public expenditures and a shift toward a more productive economy. We have already begun implementing these measures. However, it is essential to recognize that while our current endeavours may alleviate the bankrupt label unless further steps are taken promptly, we risk facing the same fate within a decade. Consequently, the governments course must be charted anew, underpinned by a revamped system. Sound financial discipline should guide our governance approach, extracting maximal benefits from each government institution. Initiatives to trim superfluous expenses within ministries are in the pipeline. Moreover, an inventory of government-owned land, buildings, and vehicles is being compiled under the Prime Ministers Secretarys leadership, with expectations of its completion by year-end. The proposed measures for domestic debt optimization have been successfully passed in the Parliament, despite attempts to hinder the process through legal channels. The EPF has introduced a draft law aimed at providing a 9 interest rate to all members, and this initiative is currently in progress. Consequently, there are no grounds to impede the advancement of this program. As stipulated in Article 04 of the Constitution, financial authority rests with the Parliament, thereby vesting it with the responsibility and competence to execute these actions. All legal cases related to this matter have been dismissed by the Supreme Court. Upon the completion of the debt optimization endeavour, our focus should shift to the effective implementation of the subsequent economic program. Presently, there is a significant exodus of individuals from our nation. The departure of skilled experts and professionals has created a substantial void that cannot be easily filled. It is essential to reaffirm our commitment to establishing a robust economic foundation conducive to the well-being of all citizens. Challenges confront our country today, primarily driven by insufficient government revenue and a trade imbalance skewed towards higher import costs relative to exports. A reliance on daily credit is not a sustainable solution. Once the debt consolidation process concludes, the same question emerges anew. We must proactively address this concern by bolstering our Gross Domestic Product (GDP) at a rapid pace, as an increased GDP directly translates to heightened national income. Parallelly, we must intensify our efforts in the realm of exports. A comprehensive strategy for this endeavour should be formulated within the next decade. In the current landscape, conventional political slogans have lost their relevance, even within both ruling and opposition parties. Instead, it is imperative to assess the countrys challenges and forge ahead with practical solutions. If the proposed solutions fail to gain traction, alternatives should be presented to address the issues at hand. To propel the nations economic development, an annual influx of at least one billion dollars in foreign exchange is essential. The initial step toward achieving this goal involves augmenting foreign exchange inflows from existing sectors. Our primary income sources are foreign employment and export earnings. Unfortunately, the economic situation in countries like Europe and America, particularly affecting the garment industry, has shown regression. Consequently, we shouldnt anticipate substantial revenue from these sectors this year. Thus, our attention must pivot to tourism. Accordingly, we have devised comprehensive plans to significantly enhance our countrys tourism sector throughout this year and the following year. Additionally, there is a pressing need to double our export revenue. To achieve this, attracting investors and providing them with the requisite facilities is essential. New initiatives such as the development of the port city have been set in motion. Furthermore, advancing rapidly over the next decade with technologies like artificial intelligence is paramount; our success or failure hinges on our ability to maintain this momentum. In line with these objectives, plans are underway to establish several government and private universities. A subsidized loan program for students entering these institutions is also on the horizon. Our aim is to annually produce a minimum of 10,000 engineers and 7,500 doctors from Sri Lankan universities. The demand for IT expertise is also substantial, necessitating consistent efforts to meet these requirements. Our aspiration is to construct a prosperous future for generations to come. It is our collective responsibility to fortify the economy to prevent a recurrence of last years adversities. The government has undertaken numerous novel measures in pursuit of this goal. However, anticipated outcomes from the Board of Investment and the Export Board have fallen short. To address this, we have established an economic commission tasked with centralizing relevant powers. This will streamline the investment approval process, eliminating the need to navigate various ministries for clearance, and consolidating all procedures in one location. Drawing inspiration from Mr. J.R. Jayawardenas establishment of the Greater Colombo Economic Commission in 1978, we also aim to create a dedicated board to provide the necessary infrastructure for investments. In tandem, we aspire to double the annual influx of tourists to our country from 2.5 million to 5 million. The Matale district possesses immense potential to contribute significantly to the burgeoning tourism industry. Within the next two months, we intend to unveil an agricultural modernization program. Our current agricultural output, whether in terms of rice or other crops, falls short. It is imperative to promote the cultivation of these products. Furthermore, we are in the process of establishing a Technology Promotion Council with the aim of acquiring the necessary technical expertise for our nation. Concurrently, a Digital Transformation Commission will be formed to propel digitization across the country. Envisioning comprehensive modernization across all sectors, our objective is to shape a developed Sri Lanka by the year 2048. The event was attended by a multitude of individuals, including Education Minister Dr. Susil Premajayantha, Prime Ministers Secretary Anura Dissanayake, Central Province Governor Lalith Y. Gamage, Ministry of Education Secretary Nihal Ranasinghe, former judge and Chairman of the Human Rights Commission M.P.B. Dehideniya, Professor Chaminda Ratnayake, Vice Chancellor of NSBM Green University, General Shavendra Silva, Chief of Staff of the Tri forces, Kaushalya Navaratne, President of the Sri Lanka Bar Association Dhammika Hewawasam, Principal of St. Thomas College in Matale, and a substantial gathering of faculty members, parents, and alumni. --PMD",

        "content": "Iraqs telecoms ministry said it will lift a ban on the Telegram messaging app on Sunday, which was imposed earlier this week, citing security concerns and data leaks of official state institutions and citizens. The app is widely used in Iraq for messaging but also as a source of news and for sharing content. Some channels contain large amounts of personal data including the names, addresses and family ties of Iraqis. The ministry said in a statement the decision to lift the ban came after the company that owns the platform responded to the requirements of the security authorities that called on the company to disclose the entities that leaked citizens data. The company also expressed its full readiness to communicate with the relevant authorities..., the statement added. In response to Reuters request for comment a member of Telegrams press team said that posting private data without consent is forbidden by Telegrams terms of service and such content is routinely removed by our moderators. We can confirm that our moderators took down several channels sharing personal data. However, we can also confirm that no private user data was requested from Telegram and that none has been shared. Last week the ministry said that the company did not respond to its request to close down platforms that leak data of the official state institutions and the personal data of citizens.
