        "date": "September 13, 2023 03:22 pm",
        "content": "Presidents Secretary Saman Ekanayake, in a letter addressed to all Secretaries to the Ministries, Provincial Chief Secretaries, District Secretaries and Divisional Secretaries, has emphasized the critical importance of enhancing communication and collaboration between government officials and political authorities at both district and divisional levels. The letter highlights concerns regarding the existing gap in effective coordination between government and semi-government institutions, District Development Committees and Divisional Development Committees. This disconnect has posed significant challenges, obstructing the successful execution of vital development projects, the Presidents Media Division (PMD) reported. Furthermore, Mr. Ekanayakes letter draws attention to the persistent complaints filed by Chairpersons of District Development Committees and Divisional Development Committees with President Ranil Wickremesinghe. These complaints have raised issues related to the obstacles faced in development work, arising from insufficient coordination between political authorities and government officials, it added. As a resolution to these ongoing challenges, the letter urges that future development plans, devised by government and semi-government institutions, incorporate the active involvement and cooperation of District Development Committees and Divisional Development Committees. This approach aims to ensure that these committees are well-informed and actively engaged in the decision-making processes concerning development activities. Mr. Ekanayakes communication reflects the governments commitment to streamlining development initiatives, boosting efficiency and ensuring the successful execution of essential projects across Sri Lanka, according to the PMD.",

Speaking to the media in this regard on Wednesday (13 Sep.), Sirisena claimed that although he was accused of several allegations in relation to the terror attacks over the last four years, the British television channels documentary shed a different light on those who should be held responsible for the attacks. We too, are raising our voices, and call for an international probe into the attacks, as proposed by the United Nations. I was judged with regards to this matter for four years, and court orders were given too. But when you look at the Channel 4 (documentary) it is clear that what actually took place is something completely different to what was perceived, he said in this regard.",

Meanwhile, the department has also notified these engine drivers that in the event of their failure to report for duty, they will be considered to have vacated their posts, adding that the relevant letters would be sent out in due course. The locomotive operating engineers have been on strike since midnight on Monday (Sept. 11) over several key demands including the amendments to the recruitment process and promotions. Commuters were afflicted yesterday as more than 100 train journeys were cancelled after locomotive operating engineers withdrew from duties. The trains that were up and running yesterday were crammed with passengers and desperate commuters also resorted to train surfing due to overcrowding. Many others were left stranded at railway stations. Meanwhile, President Ranil Wickremesinghe issued a gazette notification last evening (12) declaring the public transport services for passengers or goods and the provision and maintenance of facilities for transport services by railway lines as essential services with immediate effect under the Essential Public Service Act.

        "date": "September 13, 2023 05:09 pm",
        "content": "President Vladimir Putin said Russia would help North Korea launch satellites and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un said Moscow had his full backing in its sacred fight with the West as they met on Wednesday at a cosmodrome in Russias Far East. They would discuss all issues, Putin said when asked if the two leaders would talk about getting supplies from the North to replenish Moscows dwindling stock of weapons and ammunition at the summit at the Vostochny Cosmodrome space station. Thats why we came here, Putin said when reporters asked whether Russia would help Kim build satellites. The leader of the DPRK shows great interest in rocket engineering; they are also trying to develop space. DPRK is short for the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea, North Koreas formal name. At the opening of the meeting with Putin at the gleaming new space station, Kim said it was North Koreas unwavering position to further develop its traditional friendship and ties with Russia. I find it an honour that the president has prepared an opportunity to meet at a special environment at the launch station which is the heart of your position as a space superpower and given us a deep understanding of the way forward, Kim said. Kim also told Putin the Kremlin chief had his full backing in the sacred fight Moscow is waging against the hegemonic forces. We will always support the decisions of President Putin and the Russian leadership... and we will be together in the fight against imperialism, Kim told Putin, speaking via an interpreter. The summit between the leaders of the two countries, which have become increasingly isolated internationally, is being watched closely by Washington and allies, who suspect they could agree to trade arms and defence technology. U.S. and South Korean officials have expressed concern that Kim would provide weapons and ammunition to Russia, which has expended vast stocks in more than 18 months of war in Ukraine. Moscow and Pyongyang have denied such intentions. The choice to meet at Vostochny Cosmodrome - a symbol of Russias ambitions as a space power - was notable, as North Korea twice failed to launch reconnaissance satellites in the past four months. I am glad to see you, Putin said earlier as he welcomed Kim at Vostochny Cosmodrome, a modern space launch facility in the Amur region of Russias Far East. This is our new cosmodrome. Kim has made it a top priority to launch a spy satellite, while pushing his nuclear-armed country to step up the development of ballistic missiles, drones and attack submarines. Ahead of his meeting with Putin, Kim signed the visitor book in Korean: The glory to Russia, which gave birth to the first space conquerors, will be immortal. Television footage showed Putin giving Kim a tour of the facility including the building where the Angara, Russias new space launch rocket, is assembled. The 42.7-metre booster launches payloads into low Earth orbit. BALLISTIC MISSILES LAUNCHED IN KIMS ABSENCE Shortly before the summit, North Korea launched two short-range ballistic missiles from an area near the capital, Pyongyang, into the sea off its east coast. It was the first such launch by the North while Kim was abroad, analysts said, demonstrating an increased level of delegation and more refined control systems for the countrys nuclear and missile programmes. Kim had made just seven trips abroad in his 12 years in power, all in 2018 and 2019. He also briefly stepped across the inter-Korean border twice. After the summit, Putin and Kim had lunch on crab dumplings, sturgeon and beef with Russian wine, where Kim proposed a toast to Putins health and said he was confident the Russian army and people would triumph against evil. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the two countries cooperate in sensitive areas, including military cooperation but it is not targeted at other countries and they should not be concerned about Russias ties with North Korea. Kim arrived in Russia by private train on Tuesday with top defence industry and military aides and said his visit highlighted the strategic importance of the two countries ties, the Norths state news agency KCNA reported on Wednesday. The make-up of Kims delegation, with the notable presence of Munitions Industry Department Director Jo Chun Ryong, suggested an agenda heavy on defence industry cooperation, analysts said. Kim could offer artillery rounds from North Koreas large stockpile, which could replenish Russias capabilities in the short term, but questions about the ammunitions quality may limit the overall impact, military analysts said. South Korea and the United States have warned such a deal would violate U.N. Security Council resolutions, which Russia as a permanent member of the council voted to approve. North Korea is one of the few countries to have openly supported Russia over the Ukraine conflict, and Putin pledged last week to expand bilateral ties in all respects in a planned way by pooling efforts.

        "content": "The Sectoral Oversight Committee on Energy and Transport has held a discussion focusing on the recruitment of students of the Ceylon-German Technical Training Institute to address the shortage of technicians in the Sri Lanka Transport Board (SLTB), during a special meeting which took place recently. Officials representing the Ministry of Transport, Sri Lanka Transport Board, Ministry of Education and the Ceylon-German Technical Training Institute (CGTTI) were present before this committee which met recently, Chaired by MP Nalaka Bandara Kottegoda, the Parliamentary Communications Department said in a statement.

It was discussed that although 600 students were recruited for the full-time course because there is a good reception in the field regarding the Ceylon-German Technical Training Institute, there is a concern of them turning to other job opportunities. Furthermore, attention was paid to the shortage of trainers and the deficiencies in the facilities in providing training to the students, the statement mentioned. However, the Committee Chair instructed to take a quick decision in consultation with the relevant ministries and institutions to provide the necessary training to meet the needs of the technicians of the Sri Lanka Transport Board.

        "date": "September 13, 2023 06:20 pm",
        "content": "Mexicos Congress saw an official event where two alien corpses were unveiled in Mexico City. The official unveiling of the two alleged alien corpses was carried out by ufologist Jaime Maussan. The two small corpses were displayed for all observers. Organisers claimed that the small mummified specimen were a thousand years old and had been retrieved from Cusco, Peru. Maussan told members of the Mexican government that UFO specimen were studied at the Autonomous National University of Mexico, where scientists, he stated were able to draw DNA evidence using radiocarbon dating. He was quoted saying by Marca.com: These specimen are not part of our terrestrial evolution... These arent beings that were found after a UFO wreckage. They were found in diatom (algae) mines, and were later fossilized. Maussan also said that they were able to draw DNA evidence using radiocarbon dating and 30 of the specimens DNA was unknown. Experts, also testified under oath that one of the bodies had eggs inside and also had implants made of rare metals like Osmium. Jaime Maussan is a journalist, TV personality, and UFOlogist who was involved in the analysis of 5 mummies discovered in Nazca, Peru in 2017. The mummies were crouched humanoid figures with three fingers on their hands and feet, and dubbed aliens, a theory that was debunked. According to a report in Snopes.com, the discovery was hokum and the mummified corpse was believed to be that of a child. The report adds: The previous discovery of mummies with elongated skulls in Peru, like that shown in the Gaia video, has prompted similar wild speculation about alien species. But anthropologists have explained that elongated skulls are the result of an ancient practice of artificial cranial deformation, in which young children had their heads bound in cloth, rope, or even wooden boards, possibly as part of a religious ritual. The Nazca Mummy UFO Theory was also debunked by several other researchers. In fact, according to a report in LiveScience.com, the hands and feet seen on the mummy couldve been manipulated by forgers, with white coating added afterwards to hide the manipulations. In fact, a dozen Peruvian mummy researchers wrote a letter condemning the practice, saying it has violated numerous national and international norms. Source - The Hindustan Times - Agencies",

        "date": "September 13, 2023 08:14 pm",
        "content": "At least 56 people are known to have died and dozens were injured in a huge fire in an apartment block in Vietnams capital Hanoi. Some 37 people were injured in the fire, police said, adding that 39 victims have been identified. The fire, which broke out during the night, has been extinguished but rescue operations are continuing. Authorities in fast-growing Hanoi say many newly-built apartments do not meet fire safety regulations. The citys population has quadrupled to 5.25 million in the past 20 years. The cause of the fire is being investigated but witnesses said it started in the parking floor of the building, which was packed with motorbikes. Residents described hearing a loud bang at around 23:00 local time on Tuesday (16:00 GMT), and then seeing black smoke rising through the building. One family said they had to escape by smashing the metal railings blocking their window, and putting a ladder across to a neighbouring building. I heard a lot of shouts for help. We could not help them much, Hoa, a woman who lives nearby, told the AFP news agency. The apartment is so closed with no escape route, impossible for the victims to get out. Another witness saw a little boy thrown from a high floor to help him escape the flames, AFP reports. The smoke was everywhere. I dont know whether he survived or not although people used a mattress to catch him, she said. Fifteen fire engines were sent to assist but could not get close to the burning apartment block because the alley it was in was too narrow. The blaze highlights the challenges of managing fire safety in the regions fast-growing and poorly regulated cities. A year ago, 33 people died in a fire at a karaoke club in southern Vietnam where windows were bricked up, blocking escape. There have been many similar tragedies in other South East Asian countries like Thailand, where regulations were found afterwards either to be inadequate, or in many cases simply not enforced.

        "date": "September 14, 2023 08:31 am",
        "content": "The first review of the International Monetary Funds Extended Fund Facility (EFF) for Sri Lanka is slated to commence today (Sept. 14). This review is a significant milestone towards securing the second tranche of and enhancing confidence in the island nations economic recovery, Finance State Minister Shehan Semasinghe, in a post on X (formerly Twitter). Successful completion of the first IMF review puts Sri Lanka in a strong position for economic recovery and sets a promising pathway for growth in 2024, he added. A delegation of the Washington-based global lender will arrive in Colombo today for the review which is scheduled to go on until September 27. Sri Lanka, grappling with its worst financial crisis in more than seven decades after its foreign exchange reserves depleted to record lows, managed to secure a bailout package of nearly USD 3 billion in March 2023, after reaching a Staff-Level Agreement in September 2022. The IMFs executive board approved a 48-month arrangement of SDR 2.286 billion (approximately USD 3 billion) supported by the EFF program to help Sri Lanka ride out its economic crisis. It aims to restore Sri Lankas macroeconomic stability and debt sustainability, mitigating the economic impact on the poor and vulnerable, safeguarding financial sector stability, and strengthening governance and growth potential. This EFF program allows Sri Lanka to access financing of up to USD 7 billion from the international financial institutions (IFIs) and multilateral organizations. Under the IMF program, Sri Lanka has set a target of restructuring its debt for the next 10 years and reducing its debt-to-GDP ratio from the current 120 to about 95 by 2032. However, Sri Lanka still needs to complete talks with key bilateral creditors, including Japan, China and India, before it can take the next step to restructure its debt. The first review will take into consideration the programs performance until end-June and if approved by both the staff and the executive board, it would allow a disbursement of nearly USD 338 million. Receipt of the first tranche of the EFF which amounted to USD 333 million immediately followed the IMF executive boards approval of the bailout package in March. An IMF delegation visited the island nation in May 2023 and said keeping up the economic reform momentum and ensuring timely implementation of the IMF-supported programs commitments are key for Sri Lanka to emerge from the economic crisis. The IMF officials also said the overall macroeconomic and policy environment remains challenging despite the macroeconomic situation in Sri Lanka showing tentative signs of improvement following strong policy efforts, with inflation moderating, the exchange rate stabilizing, and the Central Bank rebuilding reserves buffers. -with inputs from agencies",

In June 2023, the Civil Aviation Authority said SriLankan Airlines and Fits Air have sought permission to hire foreign pilots, noting that both airlines are facing a serious shortage of pilots. A large number of Sri Lankan aviation industry experts and pilots have left the country in the past few months to join foreign airlines that offer much higher salaries, according to the CAA. The Airline Pilots Guild of Sri Lanka recently said SriLankan Airlines requires at least 330 pilots to function at full capacity for the designated flights. However, more than 70 pilots have resigned from the airline since 2022 with many more resignations pending and this has resulted in a complete depletion of pilots, the Pilots Guild said further.",

Lawmakers are seeking ways to mitigate dangers of the emerging technology, which has boomed in investment and consumer popularity since the release of OpenAIs ChatGPT chatbot. Musk said there was need for a regulator to ensure the safe use of AI. Its important for us to have a referee, Musk told reporters, comparing it to sports. The billionaire, who also owns the social media platform X, added that a regulator would ensure that companies take actions that are safe and in the interest of the general public. Musk said the meeting was a service to humanity and said it may go down in history as very important to the future of civilization. Musk confirmed he had called AI a double-edged sword during the forum. Zuckerberg said Congress should engage with AI to support innovation and safeguards. This is an emerging technology, there are important equities to balance here, and the government is ultimately responsible for that. He added it was better that the standard is set by American companies that can work with our government to shape these models on important issues. More than 60 senators took part. Lawmakers said there was universal agreement about the need for government regulation of AI. We are beginning to really deal with one of the most significant issues facing the next generation and we got a great start on it today, Democratic Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, who organized the forum, told reporters after the meetings. We have a long way to go. Republican Senator Todd Young, a co-host of the forum, said he believes the Senate is getting to the point where I think committees of jurisdiction will be ready to begin their process of considering legislation. But Republican Senator Mike Rounds cautioned it would take time for Congress to act. Are we ready to go out and write legislation? Absolutely not, Rounds said. Were not there. Lawmakers want safeguards against potentially dangerous deep fakes such as bogus videos, election interference and attacks on critical infrastructure. Other attendees included Nvidia (NVDA.O) CEO Jensen Huang, Microsoft (MSFT.O) CEO Satya Nadella, IBM (IBM.N) CEO Arvind Krishna, former Microsoft CEO Bill Gates and AFL-CIO labor federation President Liz Shuler. Schumer emphasized the need for regulation ahead of the 2024 U.S. general election, particularly around deep fakes. A lot of things that have to be done, but that one has a quicker timetable maybe than some of the others, he said. In March, Musk and a group of AI experts and executives called for a six-month pause in developing systems more powerful than OpenAIs GPT-4, citing potential risks to society. Regulators globally have been scrambling to draw up rules governing the use of generative AI, which can create text and generate images whose artificial origins are virtually undetectable. On Tuesday, Adobe (ADBE.O), IBM, Nvidia and five other companies said they had signed President Joe Bidens voluntary AI commitments requiring steps such as watermarking AI-generated content. The commitments, announced in July, are aimed at ensuring AIs power is not used for destructive purposes. Google, OpenAI and Microsoft signed on in July. The White House has also been working on an AI executive order. Source - Reuters - Agencies",

        "date": "September 14, 2023 05:23 pm",
        "content": "Up to 20,000 people are now feared dead after a torrent of water ripped through eastern Libya  a devastating toll that could largely have been avoided, global officials said Thursday. As rescuers in the ruined city of Derna searched underwater and under rubble, fears grew that rotting bodies could lead to a deadly outbreak of disease in the wake of this weeks floods. A precise tally of the rising number of people killed is incredibly difficult given the level of destruction and chaotic political situation in the region, with bodies still washing up on the shore and burials being held in mass graves. Death toll could still soar A deluge of rainfall from Mediterranean storm Daniel caused two dams to collapse, sending waves more than 20 feet high through the heart of Derna, a port city in the countrys east. Its mayor has said that the death toll could more than double as search teams and survivors find more bodies in the ruins. The situation is very large and surprising for the city of Derna. We were not able to confront it with our capabilities that preceded the storm and the torrent, said Mayor Abdel Moneim Al-Ghaithi. Previous estimates from aid agencies and government officials put the number of deaths at 8,000, with 10,000 people missing. Even if the capabilities were great and advanced, the scene we saw could not be confronted by us, he told Sky News Arabia on Wednesday night. He said the death toll could ultimately exceed 20,000  around a fifth of the citys population  based on estimates of those living in areas that were swept away. Most of the deaths could have been avoided if authorities had better warning systems in place, the United Nations weather and climate agency said Thursday. They could have issued the warnings and the emergency management forces would have been able to carry out the evacuation of the people, and we could have avoided most of the human casualties, Petteri Taalas, head of the World Meteorological Organization, told reporters in Geneva according to the AFP news agency. The WMO said this week that it issued warnings 72 hours before the dams collapsed, including contacting the Libyan authorities and making statements to the media. This led to a state of emergency being declared in the North African country. A humanitarian disaster is also unfolding for survivors. Fears are rising of waterborne disease affecting the area, especially with rotting bodies still washing ashore. Access to clean water, sanitation and hygiene facilities will be required to prevent a further crisis within a crisis, Elie Abouaoun, country director for Libya at the International Rescue Committee, said in a statement Wednesday. Around 30,000 people from Derna are displaced, according to the International Organization for Migration, a U.N. agency. Satellite imagery has shown the sheer scale of destruction wrought by the floods. A government official estimated Wednesday that 25 of the city was completely destroyed or washed away. Rescue teams from neighboring Egypt and Tunisia have arrived, alongside crews from the United Arab Emirates and Turkey. Othman Abduljaleel, the eastern Libyan governments health minister, said divers were searching seawater off the coast of Derna. In accordance with Islamic tradition, in which bodies are buried as soon as possible, more than 3,000 have already been placed in mass graves, he said. The hope of finding survivors has all but faded as a colossal clean-up and recovery operation begins. The Tripoli Public Services Company began clearing away rubble in Dernas previously densely populated center on Wednesday in an operation running 24 hours a day, the state-run Libyan News Agency reported. Its staff are divided into three teams: one to remove rubble that may have trapped victims, one to pump out stagnant standing water and one to re-open paths by removing fallen buildings and cars swept away by the flood. The enormous task of providing immediate aid and then rebuilding Derna is complicated by the legacies of a decade of civil conflict, which has left two rival governments ruling eastern and western Libya. Derna is controlled by the Libyan National Army, run by Field Marshall Khalifa Hifter and based in the eastern city of Tobruk. The rest of the country is run by the Government of National Unity based in the capital, Tripoli, in the west. This split has hampered reconstructions efforts for years  though aid workers say both sides are now talking to each other. Both governments have reached out to the international community requesting services and help, Tauhid Pasha, of the International Organization for Migration, told BBC Radio on Wednesday night. The Government of National Unity has extended its support to us and its request on behalf of the entire country and they are also coordinating with the government in the east, he said.

        "date": "September 14, 2023 07:07 pm",
        "content": "Minister of Agriculture Mahinda Amaraweera has assured that egg and chicken prices will likely decrease next year and remain stable thereafter. Additionally, he confirmed that there will be no need for egg imports from next year. Speaking at a news conference held at the Presidential Media Centre (PMC) this afternoon (14 Sep.), themed Collective Path to a Stable Country, the Minister highlighted that Sri Lankas poultry and egg production industry, despite being self-sufficient, experienced a decline due to reduced animal feed production caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and the economic crisis. Currently, the entire poultry and egg production for the nation is handled by the private sector, with the total chicken population across all farms exceeding 3,420,000, he said. Its worth noting that most of these chickens are expected to start laying eggs by December and industrialists anticipate a significant increase in egg production in the country after that period. We also gave these industrialists the opportunity to import maize for the production of feed required for the poultry industry. Customers will also benefit from it in the future. The Mid-term Livestock Development Program allocated Rs. 37 million to enhance livestock services in the Northern Province, Minister Amaraweera further said, adding that the Small and Medium Scale Poultry Development Project, which focuses on producing one-day-old country chicken chicks, boosting egg production in rural areas and improving nutrition, received funding of Rs. 48 million. Prior to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and the economic crisis, the countrys annual chicken meat production stood at 230,000 metric tons, resulting in a per capita chicken meat consumption of 11 kg per year. However, recent economic challenges and the impact of COVID-19 have caused a 30 reduction in local chicken meat production. Industrialists are optimistic that the production of chicken meat in the country can rebound to pre-crisis levels by the end of this year, thanks to the significant addition of broiler chickens to farms. Consequently, it is expected that the prices of chicken and eggs will continue to decrease. The Ministry of Agriculture has prioritized livestock development in the country and has initiated various programs to support this effort. These measures include promoting small and medium-scale farms, stimulating production, encouraging meat and egg exports, importing high-quality calves, developing and preserving grasslands and boosting animal feed production. Currently, Sri Lankas daily egg requirement stands at 7 million eggs. However, egg production has decreased by 50 following the COVID-19 pandemic and the economic crisis. The main factors contributing to the decline in egg and chicken meat production include a decrease in animal feed production, a shortage of foreign exchange for importing animal feed and reduced local maize production. Nevertheless, there is currently an upward trend in chicken meat and egg production in the poultry industry. Recent data shows that approximately 6 million eggs are being supplied daily, leaving a current shortage of around 1 million eggs per day. However, it is anticipated that this deficit can be addressed over the next three months. To achieve self-sufficiency in milk production, both short and long-term plans have been devised. A five-year plan known as the National Dairy Policy, spanning from 2023 to 2028 has been formulated to work towards this goal. Its worth noting that in 2021, Sri Lanka imported a total of 82,087 metric tons of milk and milk-related products, indicating a reliance on imports to meet domestic demand. Also, 1670 beneficiaries will be provided facilities for the cultivation and conservation of grass and fodder as activities to increase productivity through the management of small and medium scale dairy farms and 6 fodder and fodder processing centres will be set up. We also hope to improve 09 breeding farms belonging to the Provincial Animal Production and Health Department as well as to improve private breeding farm centres. The National Artificial Insemination Service has produced and distributed 40,000 heifers to the cattle population and 164,836 cow sperms per year. Under this project implemented with the Board of Investment, 12,000 high-quality milk cows will be deployed in the field and the annual production will be 75 million litres of milk. A large-scale animal production farm was started at the Polonnaruwa Farm belonging to the National Livestock Development Board. The amount spent for it is around Rs. 250 million.",

        "date": "September 14, 2023 08:21 pm",
        "content": "The Colombo Port City Economic Commission has revealed that the food stalls established at the Colombo Port City will be removed by March 2027. Responding to the Committee on Public Finances (COPF) concerns pertaining to the legality of the establishment of such food stalls whilst the Colombo Port City was designed mainly targeting foreign investments, members representing the Commission explained that such stalls fall under leisure activities and will therefore be removed by March 2027. The discussion pertaining to the matter was held in parliament on Tuesday (12 Sep,), under the chairmanship of MP Harsha de Silva. During the meeting, the Committee took into consideration the Regulations under the Colombo Port City Economic Commission Act, No. 11 of 2021, due to be presented before the parliament on 19 September. The COPF further inquired the legal grounds on which the Commission decided to permit the establishment of such food stalls, and on what grounds will they be removed by 2027. The Committee further questioned as to whether the Attorney General has been consulted in this regard. The Colombo Port City Economic Commission and the Attorney Generals Department were subsequently instructed to present all relevant information in this regard before the COPF as soon as possible. The Committee further inquired regarding the revenue received by the Government by the ongoing activities at the port city, and instructed the officials to submit all details with regard to this for a better understanding prior to granting approval for the Regulations. Furthermore, given that the Port City is being constructed as a separate land mass under a Smart City concept, the Committee questioned the Colombo Port City Economic Commission members present whether smart city concepts such as waste water management, renewable energy, proper sewerage mechanisms have been included. The Committee was of the view that issues experienced in other areas of the country pertaining to improper sewerage and waste water management should be avoided when developing the port city. It was also disclosed that government institutions such as the Road Development Authority, Urban Development Authority and the National Water Supply and Drainage Board (NWSDB) has spent a considerable amount of money to facilitate the construction and development of the Port City. Emphasising that this was all taxpayers money, the Committee questioned the Commission as to the benefits taxpayers reap from the establishment. Accordingly, the Committee on Public Finance instructed the Members of the Commission to submit a breakdown of the government expenses for the Port City and infrastructure and also to provide details of the streams of revenue. State Minister Dr. (Mrs.) Seetha Arambepola, Members of Parliament Chandima Weerakkodi, Nimal Lanza, Dr. Major Pradeep Undugoda, Premnath C. Dolawatte, Madhura Withanage and U.K Sumith Udukumbura, were present at this Committee meeting held.",

The World Heritage Committee ... has made the decision not to inscribe Venice and its Lagoon on the World Heritage List in Danger, UNESCO, the U.N. cultural agency, said in a statement as the committee met in Riyadh. Italian Culture Minister Gennaro Sangiuliano said adding Venice to the list would have been an undue move not based on objective facts. Venice, therefore, is not in danger, he said in a statement. Venice, known for its canals and cultural sites, has long been threatened by floods and mass tourism. Sangiuliano said UNESCO had positively assessed Italian attempts to address these issues via the MOSE anti-flooding system and by the recent approval of an entry fee for tourists, kicking in next year. However, UNESCO said more work was needed to protect the fragile lagoon city. The Committee reiterated its concerns regarding the important issues that remain to be addressed for the proper conservation of the site, including those linked to mass tourism, development projects and climate change, it said.

        "date": "September 15, 2023 10:26 am",
        "content": "Fitch Ratings has downgraded Sri Lankas Long-Term Local-Currency (LTLFC) Issuer Default Rating (IDR) to RD (Restricted Default) from C. The ratings on its local-currency bonds tendered in the domestic debt exchange have been downgraded to D from C while its other four local-currency bonds not tendered in the domestic debt exchange have been affirmed at C. The Long-Term Foreign-Currency (LTFC) IDR has been affirmed at RD, and the ratings on Sri Lankas foreign-currency bonds have been affirmed at D. All issue ratings have subsequently been withdrawn. The global credit rating agency typically does not assign Outlooks to sovereigns with a rating of CCC or below. Fitch has withdrawn the issue ratings of Sri Lankas foreign and local-currency bonds as these are no longer considered to be relevant to the agencys coverage. Key Rating Drivers Distressed Debt Exchange: The downgrade of Sri Lankas LTLC IDR reflects the partial completion of an exchange of Sri Lankas T-bonds on 14 September as part of a broader domestic debt optimisation (DDO) launched in July 2023. The DDO also includes conversion of T-bills held by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) into treasury bonds (T-bonds), which has not yet been completed. In Fitchs view, the exchange of T-bonds constitutes a distressed debt exchange (DDE) under the agencys criteria, given that the maturity extension of the tendered bonds represents a material reduction in terms versus the original contractual terms, and given that the exchange is needed to avoid a traditional payment default. Reduction in Terms: Eligible bonds for which tenders were received and accepted have been exchanged into 12 new instruments of equal size and the same aggregate principal amount, maturing between 2027 and 2038. Accepted tenders reached about 37 of the outstanding principal amount of eligible bonds outstanding as of 28 June 2023. Accepted tenders were predominantly by superannuation funds, which will face higher tax rates on income from T-bonds if they did not meet a participation threshold. Local-Currency Debt Service Continuing: Fitch believes that Sri Lanka has continued to service the T-bonds throughout the DDO process, and that T-bonds not tendered in the exchange will continue to be serviced as per their original terms, including but not limited to the entirety of the 12 series of T-bonds (out of 61 eligible series) for which no valid tenders were received. Four of these 12 series were rated by Fitch and were affirmed at C prior to withdrawal. Local-Currency Restructuring Incomplete: Under Fitchs rating criteria, the LTLC IDR will remain in RD until the debt exchange is completed in its entirety. Fitch deems the process incomplete, as the exchange of T-bills held by CBSL is still pending. Fitch regards the T-bills as public debt securities, and they are also held by private investors. Foreign-Currency IDR in Default: The sovereign remains in default on foreign-currency obligations and has initiated a debt restructuring with official and private external creditors. The Ministry of Finance had issued a statement on 12 April 2022 that it had suspended normal debt servicing of several categories of external debt, including bonds issued in international capital markets, foreign currency-denominated loans and credit facilities with commercial banks and institutional lenders. ESG - Governance: Sri Lanka has an ESG Relevance Score of 5 for Political Stability and Rights as well as for the Rule of Law, Institutional and Regulatory Quality and Control of Corruption. These scores reflect the high weight that the World Bank Governance Indicators (WBGI) have in our proprietary Sovereign Rating Model (SRM). Sri Lanka has a medium WBGI ranking in the 45th percentile, reflecting a recent record of peaceful political transitions, a moderate level of rights for participation in the political process, moderate institutional capacity, established rule of law and a moderate level of corruption. ESG - Creditor Rights: Sri Lanka has an ESG Relevance Score of 5 for Creditor Rights, as willingness to service and repay debt is highly relevant to the rating and is a key rating driver with a high weight. The affirmation of Sri Lankas LTFC IDR at RD and downgrade of LTLC IDR to RD reflect a default event. Rating Sensitivities Factors that Could, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating ActionDowngrade - The Long-Term IDRs are at the lowest level, and cannot be downgraded further - The Short-Term Local-Currency IDR will be downgraded to RD on the completion of the exchange of T-bills Factors that Could, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating ActionUpgrade - Following completion of the debt exchange with CBSL, Fitch will assign Sri Lankas LTLC IDR based on a forward-looking assessment of its willingness and capacity to honour its local-currency debt - For the LTFC IDR, completion of the foreign-currency commercial debt restructuring that Fitch judges to have normalised relationship with private-sector creditors may result in an upgrade Sovereign Rating Model (Srm) and Qualitative Overlay (QO) In accordance with the rating criteria for ratings in the CCC range and below, Fitchs sovereign rating committee has not used the SRM and QO to explain the ratings, which are instead guided by the agencys rating definitions. Fitchs SRM is the agencys proprietary multiple regression rating model that employs 18 variables based on three-year centred averages, including one year of forecasts, to produce a score equivalent to a LTFC IDR. Fitchs QO is a forward-looking qualitative framework designed to allow for adjustment to the SRM output to assign the LTFC IDR, reflecting factors within our criteria that are not fully quantifiable andor not fully reflected in the SRM. Country Ceiling The Country Ceiling for Sri Lanka is B-. For sovereigns rated CCC or below, Fitch assumes a starting point of CCC for determining the Country Ceiling. Fitchs Country Ceiling Model produced a starting point uplift of zero notches. Fitchs rating committee applied a 1 notch qualitative adjustment to this, under the balance of payments restrictions pillar, reflecting that the private sector has not been prevented or significantly impeded from converting local currency into foreign currency and transferring the proceeds to non-resident creditors to service debt payments. Fitch does not assign Country Ceilings below CCC, and only assigns a Country Ceiling of CCC in the event that transfer and convertibility risk has materialised and is affecting the vast majority of economic sectors and asset classes. References for Substantially Material Source Cited as Key Driver of Rating The principal sources of information used in the analysis are described in the Applicable Criteria. ESG Considerations Sri Lanka has an ESG Relevance Score of 5 for Political Stability and Rights as WBGI have the highest weight in Fitchs SRM and are highly relevant to the rating and a key rating driver with a high weight. As Sri Lanka has a percentile rank below 50, for the respective governance indicator, this has a negative impact on the credit profile. Sri Lanka has an ESG Relevance Score of 5 for Rule of Law, Institutional  Regulatory Quality and Control of Corruption as WBGI have the highest weight in Fitchs SRM and are therefore highly relevant to the rating and are a key rating driver with a high weight. As Sri Lanka has a percentile rank below 50 for the respective governance indicators, this has a negative impact on the credit profile. Sri Lanka has an ESG Relevance Score of 4 for Human Rights and Political Freedoms, as the Voice and Accountability pillar of the WBGI is relevant to the rating and a rating driver. As Sri Lanka has a percentile rank below 50 for the respective governance indicator, this has a negative impact on the credit profile. Sri Lanka has an ESG Relevance Score of 5 for Creditor Rights as willingness to service and repay debt is highly relevant to the rating and is a key rating driver with a high weight. Sri Lankas LTFC  LTLC IDRs are RD as the sovereign is in default on its foreign- and local-currency debt obligations. The highest level of ESG credit relevance is a score of 3, unless otherwise disclosed in this section. A score of 3 means ESG issues are credit-neutral or have only a minimal credit impact on the entity, either due to their nature or the way in which they are being managed by the entity. Fitchs ESG Relevance Scores are not inputs in the rating process; they are an observation on the relevance and materiality of ESG factors in the rating decision. --Fitch Ratings",

The directives were issued to the Criminal Investigations Department (CID) and other respondents named in the petition filed by the ill-famed criminal figure. The petition was taken up before Appeals Court president Nissanka Bandula Karunaratne and Justice Chamath Morais this morning (Sept. 15). Accordingly, Harak Kata is not to be transferred to another location without notifying the Appeals Court, Fort Magistrates Court and the Attorney General, until the petition hearing concludes. The petition had been put forward by Harak Kata through his attorneys seeking a court order preventing the law enforcement authorities from further extending the detention order issued on him. The next petition heating is fixed for September 25. The Appeals Courts orders came after reports of Harak Kata being rushed to the Colombo National Hospital after suffering a heart attack. Meanwhile, probes are underway into the notorious criminals recent failed attempt to escape from the custody of the CID. The investigators have revealed that CCTV footage of his escape attempt could not be secured as the surveillance cameras set up at the CID premises had been out of order for over a year. On September 10, Harak Kata had attempted to flee the custody of the CID, allegedly with the assistance of a Police Constable, who is believed to have fled Sri Lanka soon after the incident. In March 2023, Harak Kata was deported from Madagascar, along with Salindu Malshika alias Kudu Salindu after Malagasy defence officials informed the Sri Lankan Foreign Ministry of the arrest of the criminal duo. He has been under detention orders ever since.",

        "date": "September 15, 2023 01:01 pm",
        "content": "A city watchdog agency is investigating after a body-worn camera captured one Seattle Police Department union leader joking with another following the death of a woman who was struck and killed by a police cruiser as she was crossing a street. Daniel Auderer, who is the vice president of the Seattle Police Officers Guild, responded to the Jan. 23 crash scene where another officer, Kevin Dave, struck and killed Jaahnavi Kandula, 23, in a crosswalk. Dave was driving 74 mph (119 kmh) on the way to an overdose call, and Auderer, a drug recognition expert, was assigned to evaluate whether Dave was impaired, The Seattle Times reported. Afterward, Auderer left his body-worn camera on as he called guild President Mike Solan to report what happened. In a recording released by the police department Monday, Auderer laughs and suggests that Kandulas life had limited value and the city should just write a check. Eleven thousand dollars. She was 26 anyway, Auderer said, inaccurately stating Kandulas age. She had limited value. The recording did not capture Solans remarks. Neither Auderer nor Solan responded to emails from The Associated Press seeking comment. However, a conservative talk radio host on KTTH-AM, Jason Rantz, reported that he had obtained a written statement Auderer provided to the citys Office of Police Accountability. In it, Auderer said that Solan had lamented the death and that his own comments were intended to mimic how the citys attorneys might try to minimize liability for it. I intended the comment as a mockery of lawyers, Auderer wrote, according to KTTH. I laughed at the ridiculousness of how these incidents are litigated and the ridiculousness of how I watched these incidents play out as two parties bargain over a tragedy. The station reported that Auderer acknowledged in the statement that anyone listening to his side of the conversation alone would rightfully believe I was being insensitive to the loss of human life. The comment was not made with malice or a hard heart, he said, but quite the opposite. The case before the Office of Police Accountability was designated as classified. The Associated Press could not immediately verify the details of Auderers statement. The station said Auderer reported himself to the accountability office after realizing his comments had been recorded, because he realized their publicity could harm community trust in the Seattle Police Department. In a written statement on its online blotter, the department said the video was identified in the routine course of business by a department employee, who, concerned about the nature of statements heard on that video, appropriately escalated their concerns through their chain of command. The office of Chief Adrian Diaz referred the matter to the accountability office, the statement said. It was not immediately clear if both Auderer and the chiefs office had reported the matter to the office, or when Auderer might have done so. Gino Betts Jr., the director of the Office of Police Accountability, told The Seattle Times the investigation began after a police department attorney emailed the office in early August. Kandula was working toward graduating in December with a masters degree in information systems from the Seattle campus of Northeastern University. After her death, her uncle, Ashok Mandula, of Houston, arranged to send her body to her mother in India. The family has nothing to say, he told The Seattle Times. Except I wonder if these mens daughters or granddaughters have value. A life is a life. The King County Prosecuting Attorneys Office is conducting a criminal review of the crash. The controversy over Auderers remarks comes as a federal judge this month ended most federal oversight of the police department under a 2012 consent decree that was meant to address concerns about the use of force, community trust and other issues. Another Seattle police oversight organization, the Community Police Commission, called the audio heartbreaking and shockingly insensitive. The people of Seattle deserve better from a police department that is charged with fostering trust with the community and ensuring public safety, the commissions members said in a joint statement.

The relevant order was issued by Colombo Chief Magistrate Prasanna Alwis, when Senanayake was presented before the court this morning (15 Sep.). Senanayake was arrested on 06 September, after he reportedly surrendered to the Special Investigations Unit of the Sports Ministry, over match-fixing allegations. An overseas travel ban was imposed on the former national player, on orders of the Colombo Magistrates Court, on 14 August, a day after the Attorney Generals Department instructed the Ministry of Sports and Youth Affairs to file criminal charges against Senanayake for alleged match-fixing, as sufficient evidence has been gathered to support the charges. The 38-year-old had allegedly approached two cricketers participating in the first edition of the Lanka Premier League (LPL) in 2020 via phone calls from Dubai, instigating them to fix matches during the tournament. The Lanka Premier League was held from November 27 to December 17, 2020 in Hambantota, Sri Lanka. In 2020, a media report had alleged that the 38-year-old had contacted two cricketers participating in the first edition of the Lanka Premier League (LPL) in 2020 instigating them into corrupt practices in the inaugural LPL tournament, through phone calls made from Dubai. The former Sri Lanka off-spinner however had refuted the allegations while claiming that they were attempts to defame and slander him.

        "title": "US Presidents son Hunter Biden indicted on federal gun charges",
        "date": "September 15, 2023 02:56 pm",
        "content": "President Joe Bidens son, Hunter, has been criminally charged with three counts of lying when buying a firearm, after a proposed plea deal collapsed. The indictment marks the first time the child of a sitting president has been criminally prosecuted. A planned plea bargain to resolve gun and tax-related charges he faced abruptly fell apart in July. All three counts relate to Mr Biden, 53, allegedly lying on forms while buying a gun when he was a drug user. Prosecutors allege he falsely claimed that he was not an unlawful user of and addicted to any stimulant narcotic drug when he purchased a Colt Cobra Special revolver at a Delaware gun store in October 2018. At the time, Mr Biden was a heavy user of crack cocaine. Under US federal laws, it is a crime to lie on such documentation, or possess a firearm while a drug user. If convicted, he faces a maximum penalty of 25 years in prison, the justice department said in a statement. Actual sentences for federal crimes are usually less than the maximum possible penalties. It is still unclear when and where Mr Bidens initial court appearance will take place. Mr Bidens attorney, Abbe Lowell, suggested the charges had been influenced by Republicans improper and partisan interference in this process. He said his client did not violate the law and that his brief possession of an unloaded gun was never a threat to public safety. But a prosecutor, with all the power imaginable, bending to political pressure presents a grave threat to our system of justice, said Mr Lowell. Cornell Law School professor Randy Zellin told the BBC he believes that Mr Biden is unlikely to serve any time in prison and a plea agreement is likely. Its a nonsense case, he said. Nobody got hurt. Its a victimless crime. Hes never been in trouble before. Is this really how we want to waste judicial resources? In June, a two-part agreement was reached between prosecutors and Mr Bidens legal team, which later collapsed. Under the terms of that agreement, he would have been charged with two misdemeanour counts for failing to pay his taxes on time in 2017 and 2018. He would also have been forced to admit to illegal possession of a firearm and agree to drug treatment and monitoring to avoid a felony charge and potential imprisonment. But US District Court Judge Maryellen Noreika said she could not rubber stamp the agreement, adding that the proposed resolution of the gun-related offence was unusual. Thursdays charges are the first brought by justice department special counsel Davis Weiss, who was appointed by Attorney General Merrick Garland in August. Mr Weiss office had previously said he was seeking to indict Mr Biden by 29 September. The younger Mr Bidens legal woes have become a political lightning rod as his father seeks re-election, although he has never held a position in the White House or his fathers administration. Earlier this week, Republicans in the US House of Representatives announced an impeachment inquiry into President Biden. Among the accusations being levelled against the elder Mr Biden are that he lied about his involvement in his sons business dealings while serving as vice-president from 2009-17. Two tax investigators also claimed the justice department stymied the investigation into Hunter Bidens tax return. The department has denied the claims. On X, the platform formerly known as Twitter, House Oversight Committee chairman James Comer - the man leading the indictment inquiry - said the charges against Hunter Biden were a very small start. But unless US Attorney Weiss investigates everyone involved in the fraud schemes and influence peddling, it will be clear President Bidens DOJ is protecting Hunter Biden and the big guy.

        "title": "President appoints committee to probe Channel 4s allegations on Easter attacks",
        "date": "September 15, 2023 04:00 pm",
        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe has appointed a three-member committee to investigate the allegations in the documentary aired by British television network Channel 4 on the 2019 Easter Sunday terror attacks in Sri Lanka. The committee, chaired by retired Supreme Court Justice S.I. Imam, consists of retired Air Force Commander A.C.M. Jayalath Weerakkody and Presidents Counsel Harsha A.J. Soza PC. On September 06, Channel 4 aired a controversial documentary containing startling accusations relating to the bombings on Easter Sunday (April 21) in 2019 which targeted several Catholic churches and luxury hotels in Sri Lanka. The carnage claimed the lives of more than 260 people and left hundreds of others wounded. Channel 4s new Dispatches investigation titled Sri Lankas Easter Bombings is a nearly 50-minute-long videos with serious, yet straightforward allegations about the attacks. It was based on the testimonies of high-placed whistleblowers who alleged that senior governmental officials were complicit in this heinous act. The main whistleblower Hanzeer Azad Maulana was a spokesman for LTTEs breakaway group Tamil Makkal Viduthalai Pullikal (TMVP) led by current State Minister of Rural Road Development Sivanesathurai Chandrakanthan alias Pillayan. According to the documentary, Maulana, who has sought asylum overseas after facing fraud charges here, has witnessed a meeting in Puttalam in 2018, between the suicide bombers and a top Sri Lankan intelligence officer prior to the Easter Sunday attacks. Claiming that he had, on the directives of Pillayan, arranged the said meeting between then-army intelligence chief Major General Suresh Sallay and the National Thowheed Jamaath (NTJ) members including its leader Zahran Hashim, Maulana said the plot to create insecurity in the country to pave way for former president Gotabaya Rajapaksa to win the presidential election later in 2019 was hatched over 2-3 years. The documentary, which recapped the countrys political situation, also gave a lengthy commentary on former presidents Mahinda Rajapaksa and Gotabaya Rajapaksas time in power and their attempts to return to power after election defeats. Recalling the 2009 disappearance of journalist Lasantha Wickrematunga who was a prominent critic of the then-government, the Dispatches investigation video claimed that Mahinda Rajapaksas administration had formed a clandestine death squad called the Tripoli Platoon with the support of Pillayans group to crack down on anti-government media persons. It had interviewed former senior CID officer Nishantha Silva who was investigating the disappearance of Wickrematunga. He claimed that he found phone record evidence putting Tripoli Platoon members at the scene and that Gotabaya Rajapaksa had direct monitoring of this death squad. The documentary also presented testimonies from His Eminence Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith, journalist Frederica Jansz who was a witness in the White Flag case, the brother of journalist Lasantha Wickrematunga, former commissioner of Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka (HRCSL) Ambika Satkunanathan and former diplomat Sarath Kongahage. However, Kongahage later accused the British television network of distorting his comments from the interview. Calling a media briefing on September 12, the former ambassador said Channel 4 had used his remarks out of context. Meanwhile, former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa also hit out at the documentary, deeming it an anti-Rajapaksa tirade aimed at blackening the Rajapaksa legacy from 2005 onwards and is a tissue of lies just like the previous films broadcast by the same channel. The Defence Ministry and Major General Sallay went on to categorically deny the claims that the latter was complicit in orchestrating the bombings. A statement from the ministry stressed that the terrorists involved in the suicide attacks had never been on the governments payroll, and vowed to unequivocally hold Channel 4 accountable for any unforeseen actions or repercussions stemming from their unfounded, malevolent and poorly substantiated claims in the video. However, opposition members including Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa and Malcolm Cardinal Ranjith have called for an independent, transparent and broad international investigation into the alleged plot behind the Easter Sunday carnage.",

        "date": "September 15, 2023 06:59 pm",
        "content": "The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) on Thursday released a new report on what it calls the unidentified anomalous phenomenon (UAP), better known to the public as unidentified flying objects, or UFOs. In response to a recommendation by an independent study team for NASA to play a more prominent role in understanding UFOs, the US space agency announced that it is appointing a director of UAP research. During the press conference, NASA officials were also asked questions about the UFO hearing in Mexicos Congress that featured the presentation of alleged remains of non-human beings. David Spergel, the former head of Princeton Universitys astrophysics department and chair of the UAP report, said he did not know the nature of the samples but urged transparency. This is something that I have only seen on Twitter. When you have unusual things, you want to make the data public, Mr Spergel said. We dont know the nature of those samples, he said. If you have something strange, make samples available to the scientific community, he told the Mexican government. Alien Bodies presented in Mexican Congress Mexican journalist and long-time UFO enthusiast Jaime Maussan showed politicians at the hearing on Tuesday two tiny bodies displayed in cases, with three fingers on each hand and elongated heads. He said in the presentation that the specimens were recovered near Perus ancient Nazca Lines and had been carbon-dated by Mexicos National Autonomous University (UNAM) and concluded to be about 1,000 years old. Maussan claimed they were not related to any species on Earth. I think there is a clear demonstration that we are dealing with non-human specimens that are not related to any other species in our world and that all possibilities are open for any scientific institution... to investigate it, Maussan said. We are not alone, he added. The images from the congressional hearing -- featuring purported alien bodies -- have now gone viral on social media platforms. Source - NDTV - Agencies",

        "content": "The new Central Bank Act, aimed at bolstering the banks independence, accountability and price stability in the country, comes into effect today (15 Sep.), Acting Minister of Finance Ranjith Siyambalapitiya said. Accordingly, the Acting Minister explained that as per the new Act, the Central Bank of Sri Lankas (CBSL) ability to print money will be limited, as opposed to their manners of printing money, rather excessively, in the recent past. He emphasised that such money printing would be allowed only under special circumstances, such as a concern of national security or a global health crisis, adding that only an amount not exceeding 5 of the value of the issued Treasury Bills can be printed. Siyamabalapitiya further explained that the CBSL will now be required to work towards achieving the set inflation target, and in the event it fails to do so, it will be required to explain why. Meanwhile, with regards to appointments to the General Board of Governors of CBSL, Siyambalapitiya emphasised that the Treasury Secretary will no longer be involved in this process. He added that the qualifications required for such appointments have also been listed in the new CBSL Act, while all such appointments will require approval from the Constitutional Council.",

        "content": "Minister of Labour and Foreign Employment Manusha Nanayakkara has assured that the existing 9 employee benefit related to the Employees Provident Fund (EPF) will remain unchanged. As a government, we have secured approval from both parliament and the Cabinet and we have made the decision to extend the 9 return for another four years. This means that individuals will continue to receive an annual benefit of 9 on their savings, without any additional 14 or 30 taxes, Nanayakkara said noting that it is important to clarify some misconceptions on this matter. The lawmaker also emphasized that taxation is not levied on the funds held by members of the EPF, instead, it is imposed as a percentage of 14 on the profits generated from the funds investments. Minister Nanayakkara made these remarks during his participation in a press conference held today (Sept. 15) at the Presidential Media Centre, on the theme of Collective Path to a Stable Country. Disregarding the statements that superannuation funds EPF and ETF (Employee Trust Fund) are in danger as largely rhetorical and lacking a substantial plan, the lawmaker noted that the Central Bank, as the custodian of the EPF, is an independent institution and will not be negatively affected. It is important to emphasize that decisions regarding the Fund will not be made through the Ministry of Labour. Speaking further, he said the government is planning to implement a digital data system at the beginning of 2024, which will strengthen the countrys migrant labour policy. Additionally, we have completed the groundwork for digitalizing all data systems in the Labour Department and are actively working towards introducing an E-salary system.",

        "title": "Migrant crisis overwhelms Italian island Lampedusa with arrival of nearly 7,000 people",
        "date": "September 15, 2023 11:57 pm",
        "content": "Lampedusa has seen an influx of migrants with 7,000 people arriving in two days, prompting its mayor and the United Nations refugee agency to warn the Italian island is becoming overwhelmed. The island  whose population is under 7,000  has long been a first port of call for people crossing from north Africa and has been a flashpoint in Europes migration crisis. Mayor Filippo Mannino on Thursday said the migrant crisis had reached a point of no return. In the past 48 hours, around 7,000 people have arrived on my island, an island that has always welcomed and saved in its arms, Mannino told Italys RTL 102.5 radio. Now we have reached a point of no return where the role played by this small rock in the middle of the Mediterranean has been put into crisis by the dramatic nature of this phenomenon. The figure was also confirmed to CNN by the countrys interior ministry. The UN refugee agencys (UNHCR) Representative for Italy, the Holy See and San Marino, Chiara Cardoletti, said Friday the situation on Lampedusa is critical, and moving people off the island is an absolute priority. Cardoletti said that urgent action was underway to bring the island back to normality and that authorities had transferred around 5,000 people off the island in the last 28 hours. Many of the latest people to arrive have fled political instability in Tunisia. In previous years, most came from Libya and had been rescued by NGO charity vessels and Italian rescuers rather than reaching the island, according to the International Organization for Migration (IOM). The group now fears numbers will rise even further following the catastrophic floods in Libya. On Wednesday, Germany said it informed Italy of its decision to postpone until further notice its intake of migrants under a European voluntary solidarity plan, according to the countrys interior ministry. That program oversees the relocation of asylum-seekers for a year and is aimed at easing pressure on EU borders. Separately, Frances Interior Minister Gerard Darmanin said earlier this week that due to the destabilization of Libya and Tunisia, which has accelerated, more migrants were arriving at the French and Italian border. Many of those arriving in Lampedusa, and who are transferred to the Italian mainland, try to cross the Ventimiglia border into the French seaside town of Menton. Darmanin who was speaking from Menton on Tuesday, said we have a 100 increase in flows on the Italian border, which obviously affects the Alpes-Maritimes department as well as all the departments in the Alps, announcing very significant reinforcements to tackle the situation at the border and fight illegal immigration. I look at our German friends, they have four times as many asylum applications as we do, which is proof that when you put a lot of resources at the border you also limit attractiveness of our country, Darmanin said. A large proportion of the people who cross the Italian border here want to go to Great Britain, which is also an incentive to negotiate with our British friends and in particular develop a European treaty between the European Union and Great Britain, he added. Rosario Valastro, president of Red Cross Italy, whose facility on Lampedusa hosts thousands despite being built for 500 people, said he was expecting some relief after this weeks surge. Activity continues incessantly at the Lampedusa hotspot where 3,800 people are present this morning, the Red Cross said in a statement Friday. The over 130 operators and volunteers of the Italian Red Cross are doing beyond the impossible to ensure basic necessities. Yesterday, 5,000 lunch meals and 5,000 dinner meals were produced. We are tested but operational, Valastro said. For us, people come before anything else, he added. As of September 14, 125,928 people had arrived in Italy, according to the Interior Ministry, a number thats in line with those from 2016, when migrant numbers surged in the wake of the Syrian war. However, Flavio Di Giacomo, from IOM, said the number of arrivals in Lampedusa now was much higher than before. A lack of Libyan Coast Guard presence due to the floods, and the high number of migrants in Libya (a transit country for migration to Europe) kept in detention centers who are now desperate to leave, could also affect arrivals in the coming weeks. This week, Italys Minister of Infrastructure Matteo Salvini called the arrivals an act of war during a press conference with Italys Foreign Press Association. He suggested the arrivals were being orchestrated and said the government would stop at nothing to curtail the arrivals, applauding Italian PM Giorgia Melonis attempts to negotiate with Tunisia. In July, Meloni, along with EU chief Ursula Von der Leyen, traveled to Tunisia with a promise of investment funds as an incentive to stop the boats, including 105 million euros (111 million) dedicated to stop smugglers, but the EU this week largely stalled the plan in Brussels. Meloni, under pressure from within her own coalition on migrant numbers, has not commented directly on Lampedusa, but told RAI on Thursday that relocation was not the issue  stopping the arrivals was.

        "title": "Sri Lanka financial institution ratings not affected by sovereign downgrade: Fitch",
        "date": "September 16, 2023 12:43 am",
        "content": "Sri Lanka bank ratings are unaffected by the downgrade of Sri Lankas Long-Term Local-Currency Issuer Default Rating to RD from C, says Fitch Ratings. On 14 September 2023, the global credit rating agency downgraded the sovereigns Long-Term Local-Currency Issuer Default Rating following the completion of an exchange of treasury bonds for longer-dated ones, which forms a part of the broader domestic debt optimisation program. The exchange of treasury bills held by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) has yet to be completed. In a statement, Fitch said: We do not believe the completion of the first phase of the restructuring of the sovereigns local-currency obligations is likely to trigger a loss of depositor confidence in the banking system, leading to a widespread default within the financial system, including for non-bank financial institutions (NBFIs). As such, we expect the banks to continue to service their local-currency obligations, given their better funding and liquidity profiles relative to that of the sovereign. Fitch says it continues to maintain the Rating Watch Negative (RWN) on Sri Lanka banks and NBFIs ratings to reflect the potential for deterioration in their creditworthiness relative to other entities on the Sri Lankan national ratings scale. This reflects near-term downside risks to credit profiles from spill-over effects from the remainder of the sovereigns debt restructuring, while access to wholesale foreign-currency funding remains constrained. Further clarity around the sovereign debt restructuring process, particularly on the foreign-currency debt, that points to a reduction in stresses that have affected the banking sector in the past several quarters, would result in a resolution of the RWN with affirmation of the bank ratings. While the local banks have been spared from the rupee debt restructuring, we believe that the broader economic conditions remain challenging as reflected in the expected contraction of the economy and high volatility of economic variables. This may still place downward pressure on individual credit profiles, particularly for NBFIs, which tend to be more exposed to cyclically sensitive segments. We believe that the re-assessment of the sovereign credit profile following the completion of the debt exchange with CBSL will influence the ratings of the banks and NBFIs, given the high interconnectedness. While the domestic debt optimisation programme is nearing completion, uncertainties prevail over the completion of the foreign-currency sovereign debt restructuring. Any doubts over this could weigh on the banking sector with spillover effects to the NBFIs, given the banks exposure to defaulted foreign-currency sovereign bonds, albeit they make up a small share of sector assets (3.6 of assets at end-1H23). --Fitch Ratings",

        "date": "September 16, 2023 07:59 am",
        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe delivered a compelling address at the Summit of the Heads of State and Government of the G77  China in Havana, Cuba yesterday (15). In his speech, President Wickremesinghe emphasized the crucial role of science, technology and innovation in overcoming the current development challenges faced by developing nations worldwide, the Presidents Media Division reported. President Wickremesinghe began by commending Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel Bermudez for convening the Group of 77 plus China (G77China) Summit in Havana and acknowledging Cubas historic role as a champion for the concerns and aspirations of developing nations within various multilateral forums. He noted the unprecedented challenges confronting the global South, including the pandemic, climate change, food, fertilizer and energy crises, which threaten the achievement of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and exacerbate the global debt crisis. President Wickremesinghe then delved into the historical perspective of technological development, highlighting how Europes advancements in the 15th century, such as gunpowder, cannons and ocean-going ships, enabled it to conquer other parts of the world, resulting in the technological divide seen today. He underscored that a new technological divide is emerging in the 21st century, necessitating the adoption of digitalization and new technologies, such as Big Data, IoT, AI, Blockchain, Biotechnology and Genome Sequencing, to bridge the gap. He emphasised the importance of an educated manpower well equipped with knowledge and technological know-how essential for the smooth flow of the needed transformations which will lubricate the development and catching up process in developing nations. The President outlined his governments initiatives, including the evaluation of underperforming Science and Technology Research Institutes and the establishment of a Technology and Innovation Council and a Digital Transformation Agency. Additionally, Sri Lanka plans to create four new universities specializing in new technologies, with one being the result of technological cooperation between India and Sri Lanka. The International Climate University will be the 05th. Addressing the digital divide, President Wickremesinghe cited challenges such as limited access to costly technology, insufficient digital skills and infrastructure, cultural and institutional barriers and financing constraints. He called for effective cooperation mechanisms within the G77 and China, including the revitalization of the Consortium of Science  Technology  Innovation for the South (COSTIS) and the commitment of member countries to earmark 1 of their GDP for RD over a decade. President Wickremesinghe stressed the importance of collaboration between governments and the private sector and proposed creating technological platforms in fields like digitalization, health, medication, AI and renewable energy including green hydrogen, inspired by the European Unions Technology  Innovation Platforms. The brain drain from the South to the North and the resulting loss of educated manpower is another threat to the development of Science Technology and Innovation of the South, President Wickremesinghe said, adding that China, India, Japan and South Korea have developed Science Technology and Innovation by nurturing their manpower. Therefore, we must ask for compensation from the North for the loss of our manpower, he added. He also urged increased South-South cooperation and proposed a scheme akin to the Colombo Plan to enhance collaboration, exchange best practices and develop policies that harness the transformational potential of science, technology and innovation. In conclusion, President Wickremesinghe reaffirmed Sri Lankas commitment to supporting the new Havana Declaration and called for the collective voice of G77 and China to be heard in international fora. The Presidents address underscored the significance of science, technology and innovation in shaping the future of developing nations, making it a pivotal moment at the G77 and China Summit.

        "date": "September 16, 2023 02:21 pm",
        "content": "Major historical sites in two Ukrainian cities are in danger of destruction due to the war with Russia, the UNs heritage body Unseco has said. They include the iconic Saint Sophia Cathedral in the capital, Kyiv, and the medieval buildings of the citys Kyiv-Pechersk Lavra monastery site. The historic centre in the city of Lviv has also been placed on Unescos List of World Heritage in Danger. It said the conditions to fully protect the sites could not be met. Faced with the risk of direct attack, these sites are also vulnerable to the shockwaves caused by the bombing of the two cities, the group said its World Heritage Committee had concluded. It added that the inclusion of the sites on the list was a reminder to UN member states about their responsibility to contribute to their protection and would open the door to further financial and technical aid. Russia has assured the UN that its armed forces are taking necessary precautions to prevent damage, though this is disputed by Ukraine. The latest additions to the danger list come after the Ukrainian port city of Odesa was added in January - nearly a year after Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Odesa has come under heavy bombardment by Russia in recent months following the collapse of a deal allowing Ukraine to export its grain to the world through the Black Sea. Russias bombing of Ukraine has sometimes drawn criticism from Unesco. In July, the organisation condemned the bombing on a building just outside Lvivs historic old town. The city was founded in the Middle Ages and has maintained much of its architectural and cultural heritage as an administrative, religious and commercial centre from the 13th to the 20th centuries. It was added to the World Heritage List in 1998. The Saint Sophia Cathedral, meanwhile, was built in the 11th century and was designed to rival the Hagia Sophia in modern-day Turkey, which was then part of Constantinople. It is one of the few surviving buildings from that age. Kyiv-Pechersk Lavra, otherwise known as Kyivs Monastery of the Caves, was founded at around the same time as the cathedral. It is the oldest monastic complex of the Rus people, who lived in eastern Europe during the Middle Ages, and became a prominent spiritual and cultural centre. There are currently more than 50 properties on Unescos danger list. Other sites at risk include the Old City of Jerusalem, Viennas historic centre and the tropical rainforest on the Indonesian island of Sumatra. Source  BBC --Agencies",

        "date": "September 16, 2023 06:54 pm",
        "content": "United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Friday praised efforts to support the Global South in the international arena as he opened a summit of the G77 group of developing nations and China with host Cuba. The focus is the scientific and technological divide between rich and poor countries and its impact on development. Guterres said greater international equality was essential to building the consensus needed to tackle climate change and inequality. The world is failing developing nations, he said, expressing the hope that the meeting would strengthen participants clout on a wide range of issues. He echoed climate advocates who have long urged developed nations, including top greenhouse gas polluters such as the United States, to pay to mitigate climate change and lessen the weight of foreign debt. Battered by extreme weather, the pandemic, international tensions and economic difficulties, developing countries are pressing for fair treatment from developed nations regarding international finance to sharing technology. This year Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel heads up the G77, the UNs largest organization. He cited statistics showing 84 million children are at risk of being out of school by 2023 and over 660 million people are without electricity, adding these disparities now include the internet and advances in digital technology. Science, technology and innovation have reached the unimaginable, he said, that in conditions of greater equality and justice could insure more dignified and comfortable lives for the population of almost the entire planet, Diaz-Canel said. He added that science and technology play a transcendental role in promoting productivity, efficiency, creating added value, humanizing working conditions, promoting well-being and guaranteeing development, he said. In a marathon day of speeches, Colombias president Gustavo Petro told the forum we are killing each other in reference to the war in Ukraine. I would ask the G77 that we also address this issue of war, to overcome it, not because we have to take sides between Russia or Ukraine, said Petro, among the few representatives present who mentioned the Ukraine war. What is the difference between the war between Russia and Ukraine, and that between Israel and Palestine? Colombias president said. The G77, which was initially launched in 1964 with 77 nations, now has 134 members. China maintains that it is not a G77 member, despite being listed as one by the bloc, but Beijing says it has supported the groups legitimate claims and maintained cooperative relations. While more than 90 delegations are participating in the summit, which ends on Saturday, only a few dozen are led by heads of state. Source - Reuters --Agencies",

        "date": "September 16, 2023 07:19 pm",
        "content": "Apple has agreed to install updates for the iPhone 12 in France after French regulators ordered the company to stop selling the model because it emits electromagnetic radiation levels that exceed European Union standards. The company, which just unveiled its newest generation of iPhones, insists the 12 model is safe and the phones have been certified in countries around the world since its introduction in 2020. It says the problem raised by the French government agency that manages wireless communications frequencies is related to a specific testing protocol. The French agency said the iPhone 12 recently failed one of two types of tests for electromagnetic waves capable of being absorbed by the body. On Tuesday, Frances government ordered a halt to sales of the iPhone 12 and told Apple to issue a software update to address the problem or face a recall. Apple said in a statement Friday that it will issue a software update for users in France to accommodate the protocol used by French regulators. It did not elaborate. The French ban could have extended to all 27 EU countries after three months if Apple had refused to issue updates and if no other government objected, European Commission spokesperson Sonya Gospodinova said Thursday. Frances digital affairs minister said the iPhone 12s radiation levels are still much lower than what scientific studies consider potentially harmful to users, and the radiation agency acknowledged that its tests dont reflect typical phone use. Cellphones have been labeled as possible carcinogens by the World Health Organizations cancer research arm, putting them in the same category as coffee, diesel fumes and the pesticide DDT. The radiation produced by cellphones cannot directly damage DNA and is different from stronger types of radiation like X-rays or ultraviolet light. Experts have recommended that people concerned about their cellphone radiation exposure use earphones or switch to texting. Source  The Associated Press --Agencies",

        "content": "The Sri Lankan economy has contracted by 3.1 in the second quarter of this year against the value reported in the same quarter in the previous year, according to data released by the Department of Census and Statistics (DCS). Outlining the background of the analysis the Department of Census and Statistics stated that, in the second quarter of year 2023, the pressure on short-term and long-term investments caused by high interest rates in the economy remained effective. Furthermore, the Department pointed out that high input costs have led to the deterioration of international competitiveness in terms of exports and as a result, it has led to a decrease in export volumes. Along with those developments, the consumption pattern of the general public was limited to consuming mainly consumer goods due to the pressure exerted through the reduction in real income. Further, as an aggregate, expectations of domestic producers on the economy were at a lower level and continued to grow slowly. A key driver of those expectations was the uncertain situation related to exchange rates, it added. Moreover, the high input costs have led to the deterioration of international competitiveness in terms of exports and as a result, a decrease in export volumes was also noted by the Department of Census and Statistics. According to the report, the Agricultural sector of the economy contributed by 10.4 while the Industrial and Services sectors contributed their share to the GDP at current prices by 27 and 56.8 respectively. The Taxes fewer subsidies on products component contributed 5.8 to the GDP in the second quarter of the year 2023, according to the relevant department. The department further highlighted that during this quarter, agricultural activities have expanded by 3.6 while Industrial and Services activities have contracted by 11.5 and 0.8 respectively.",

Foreigners Regional Registration Officer P Ve Arunshakthikumar, Bureau of Immigration, Ministry of Home Affairs of India stated this in his counter affidavit filed on Thursday, in response to a petition filed by S Nalini, one of the seven convicts ordered to be released by the Supreme Court last year. She had sought a direction to the authorities to release her husband Sriharan alias Murugan from the Special Camp (Foreigners Detention Centre), Tiruchirapally, to enable him to live with her in the city.

        "content": "Fishermen in Rameswaram went on a strike on Saturday demanding the release of eight Rameswaram fishers arrested by the Sri Lankan authorities. All the 800 odd fishing vessels were moored at the fishing jetty and fishermen did not collect the fishing tokens. The Sri Lankan navy on Wednesday night detained 17 fishermen -- eight Rameswaram fishermen and nine fishers from Pudukkottai district -- on charges of poaching in the territorial waters of the island nation. The Sri Lanka navy seized the three fishing boats from them. The fishermen were produced before a Lankan court in Jaffna and lodged in prison after the court remanded them in judicial custody till September 27. Condemning the repeated arrests of fishermen by the Sri Lankan navy, the fishermen associations called for a strike on Saturday. The state government and the Centre should expedite diplomatic measures to release our fishermen and the fishing vessels confiscated by Sri Lanka, said fishermen leader P Jesuraja from Rameswaram. Sri Lanka navy has seized 17 trawlers and apprehended 110 Indian fishermen so far in 2023. While the Lankan courts usually release the fishermen on conditional bail that they should never return to Sri Lanka for fishing, the fishing crafts are not returned to the boat owners.

        "date": "September 16, 2023 10:27 pm",
        "content": "Senior Adviser to the President on National Security and Chief of the Presidential Staff Sagala Ratnayake, revealing a significant government decision said that the government has resolved to undertake a comprehensive restructuring of the government institutions entrusted with environmental responsibilities. Furthermore, Mr. Ratnayaka highlighted that a committee will be established to bolster environmental protection laws and facilitate the restructuring efforts, the Presidents Media Division (PMD) reported. Mr. Ratnayaka, also disclosed that President Ranil Wickremesinghe intends to establish a dedicated task force focused on preventing environmental pollution and safeguarding the environment. This task force will be responsible for formulating, implementing and monitoring environmental protection initiatives. Senior Adviser to the President on National Security and Chief of the Presidential Staff Sagala Ratnayaka made these remarks during his participation in a beach cleaning program held at the Beach Plaza in the Port City on the occasion of the International Coastal Clean-up Day (ICCD) and the commencement of Marine Resources Conservation Week. These events will encompass cleanliness drives, awareness campaigns and seabed cleaning activities at 66 locations, targeting identified beaches and lagoon areas spanning all 14 coastal districts across the island. The program, initiated by the Marine Environment Protection Authority, commenced at the Beach Plaza in the Port City. Sagala Ratnayaka actively participated in the beach cleaning activities, the PMD said. During his address at the subsequent ceremony, he shared the following remarks: This program has been initiated in commemoration of International Coastal Cleanliness Day and Marine Resources Conservation Week. The coastal, reservoir, canal and riverine environments hold immense significance for our nation. Being an island nation, we rely heavily on water resources. Simultaneously, as a country dependent on tourism, the preservation of a pristine environment is paramount to attract tourists consistently. Such initiatives play a pivotal role in instigating proactive change in our citizens, heightening environmental awareness and especially educating our children about the importance of environmental preservation. I extend my gratitude to all those involved in organizing this program. Historically, our discourse primarily revolved around these matters. Consequently, the implementation of such hands-on programs becomes increasingly vital. Numerous institutions, including the Maritime Environment Protection Authority, Coastal Conservation Department and local government bodies, are actively involved in managing environmental concerns. Notably, the Navy, while not primarily responsible, provides valuable support in these efforts. Additionally, there are designated tourism zones governed by the Sri Lanka Tourism Board. In recognition of the need for more effective environmental governance, we have made the decision to restructure these government agencies with environmental responsibilities. To oversee this restructuring, a dedicated committee will be appointed. Moreover, the aim is to fortify existing environmental laws following the reorganization process. In tandem with these initiatives, President Ranil Wickremesinghe intends to establish a task force. This task forces mandate will encompass the development, execution and supervision of activities aimed at addressing environmental concerns. Through these comprehensive programs, we aspire to enhance public awareness and implement sustainable measures to mitigate environmental pollution. The environment holds immense significance for the present and future generations. Failing to safeguard it could result in dire consequences for the generations to come. Furthermore, the sustainability of Sri Lankas economy can be ensured only through the protection of our environment. It is crucial to acknowledge that the responsibility for environmental preservation cannot rest solely with the government. Every individual also bears a significant responsibility in this endeavour and it is imperative to implement a comprehensive awareness program to inform the public about their role in safeguarding the environment. Therefore, we are committed to fulfilling this responsibility effectively. It is essential to execute these activities meticulously, minimizing any shortcomings. The program undertaken today is of paramount importance and it is commendable to see the integration of art and technology into these efforts. I extend my gratitude to all the agencies, departments and security forces involved in this initiative. The event was attended by notable figures including Navy Commander Vice Admiral Priyantha Perera, Chairman of the Maritime Environment Protection Authority Lawyer Asela B Rekawa, General Manager Jagath Gunasekara, other board members, as well as Port City Private Companys environmental consultant W.A.D.D.
