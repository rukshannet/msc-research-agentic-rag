        "date": "November 22, 2023 07:01 am",
        "content": "UPDATE: Israel and Hamas have reached an agreement enabling the release of some hostages captured by the Palestinian militant group during its Oct. 7 attack on the country, Israeli media Axios and Haaretz reported Tuesday, citing those familiar with the deal. The deal will see Hamas release 30 children, eight mothers and 12 other women, according to the media reports. There will be a temporary cease-fire. Israel is expected to release about 150 Palestinians, mostly women and children. Israel will also allow 300 aid trucks to enter Gaza per day during the pause in fighting in the Palestinian enclave. Haaretz added that all branches of Israels security services support the deal. A source told the publication that Hamas may release foreign nationals at the same time in accordance with other deals struck with separate countries. Qatar and the U.S. have been reportedly working for weeks with both sides on a potential agreement behind the scenes. (CNN)  Israels cabinet has approved a deal that would see the release of at least 50 hostages  women and children  from Gaza, according to an Israeli government statement, in what is expected to result in the first sustained pause in fighting and major de-escalatory step since Israels war with Hamas began. The freeing of the hostages will come in exchange for a four-day truce in Israels air and ground campaign in Gaza, the statement said. It made no mention of the release of Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails, though it is understood this is also a key part of the deal. The deal was approved by the Israeli cabinet by a significant majority, the government source told CNN. A more detailed statement will be sent to families of the hostages later today, the statement added. There are 239 hostages being held captive in Gaza, including foreign nationals from 26 countries, according to figures from the Israeli military. The mass abductions took place during on October 7, when Hamas militants struck across the border in coordinated attacks killing around 1,200 people  the largest such attack on Israel since the countrys founding in 1948. Many of the hostages were seized at gunpoint during Hamas rampage of violence though border communities near the Gaza Strip and the nearby Nova music festival. Israel responded to the attacks by imposing a blockade on Gaza that cut off supplies of food, water, medicines and fuel, and launched a relentless air and ground assault that has plunged the enclave into a dire humanitarian crisis. More than 12,000 people have died in Gaza since October 7, according to the Hamas-run governments press office. Just a handful of hostages have been released prior to the deal. On October 20, two Americans  Judith Tai Raanan and her 17-year-old daughter Natalie Raanan  were freed on humanitarian grounds following negotiations between Qatar and Hamas. Soon after, two Israeli women, Nurit Cooper and Yocheved Lifshitz, were also released. Lifshitz said she went through hell, describing being snatched from her home and driven off on a motorbike before being taken to a network of tunnels. Source: CNN --Agencies",

        "content": "The agreement reached between Sri Lanka and the Export-Import Bank of China (Exim Bank) is a positive step forward in the island nations debt restructuring process, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) says. Commenting on the matter, IMFs Senior Mission Chief Peter Breuer said the global lender stands ready to move forward with the first program review as soon as financing assurances from all official creditors are in place. Meanwhile, State Minister Ranjith Siyambalapitiya said on Tuesday (Nov.21) that the Executive Committee of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) is scheduled to deliberate on the release of the second tranche of the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) to Sri Lanka on December 06. On October 11, the Ministry of Finance, Economic Stabilization  National Policies announced that Sri Lanka has reached an agreement on the key principles and indicative terms of a debt treatment with the Exim Bank of China. The ministry also mentioned that the agreement in principle covers approximately USD 4.2 billion of outstanding debt. The indicative terms agreed are expected to provide the necessary fiscal space for Sri Lanka to implement its ambitious reform agenda. Sri Lankan authorities had expressed hopes that this landmark achievement would provide an anchor to their ongoing engagement with the Official Creditor Committee and commercial creditors, including the bondholders. Later in October, the IMF team and Sri Lankan authorities reached a staff-level agreement on economic policies to conclude the first review of the 48-month Extended Fund Facility (EFF)-supported program. Accordingly, Sri Lanka will have access to SDR 254 million (approximately USD 330 million) in financing once IMF Management and Executive Board approve the review. Sri Lankan government is hopeful that this second tranche of the IMF loan is expected to be received in December this year. The first tranche of the loan came through in March 2023, soon after the IMFs Executive Board approved a USD 2.9 billion bailout package for Sri Lanka.",

        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe is currently delivering a special statement in parliament in respect of several matters including the countrys economy, the ongoing debate on 2024 Budget and the Sri Lankan cricket ordeal. The address of the Head of State comes a day after the parliament passed the Second Reading of 2024 Budget by a majority of 45 votes and the International Cricket Council (ICC) confirmed the terms of the suspension of Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC). After hearing representation from SLC, the ICC Board, which met in Ahmedabad on Tuesday (Nov.21), decided that Sri Lanka could continue to compete internationally both in bilateral cricket and ICC events after being suspended recently. On November 10, the ICC suspended the Sri Lankan cricket governing body for breaching its obligations as a member in particular the requirement to manage its affairs autonomously and without government interference. At its board meeting on Tuesday, the ICC has, however, decided to control funding to SLC. Additionally, the ICC Board confirmed that Sri Lanka would no longer host the U19 Mens Cricket World Cup 2024, which will now be held in South Africa in January. As the cricket ordeal continued to snowball, President Wickremesinghe, on November 06, established a Cabinet sub-committee to look into the gazette notification issued by Sports Minister Roshan Ranasinghe appointing an Interim Committee for SLC and suspending the existing cricket governing body. Spearheaded by Minister Ali Sabry, the sub-committee comprises Ministers Tiran Alles, Manusha Nanayakkara and Kanchana Wijesekera. The sports ministers seven-member Interim Committee for SLC was chaired by World Cup-winning former Sri Lanka captain Arjuna Ranatunga. However, as the President had not been notified of the sports ministers move beforehand. Thus, the ministerial sub-committee was appointed to look into the matter, with the consent of the Sports Minister and the President. Just a day after the interim committee was formed, the Appeals Court delivered a 14-day stay order preventing the operations of the panel, after considering a writ petition filed by SLC president Shammi Silva. This paved way for the ousted president to return to the cricket board. Later, the sports minister challenged the stay order through a motion filed before the Appeals Court. Thus far, three judges including the Appeals Court president, Justice Nissanka Bandula Karunaratne have recused themselves from the consideration of the motion. Meanwhile, SLC president and the sports minister are engaged in a blame game over the plight of the sport in the country. Shammi Silva has accused Minister Ranasinghe of political interference while the latter continues to vehemently reject the allegations. The lawmaker claims that the cricket bodys head is guilty of serious misconduct.",

        "date": "November 22, 2023 12:26 pm",
        "content": "Sam Altman will return as CEO of OpenAI, the startup said early Wednesday morning on X, formerly known as Twitter. The move follows immense pressure from employees and investors on the board that ousted him less than a week ago. Former Salesforce co-CEO Bret Taylor and former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers will join OpenAIs board, the Microsoft-backed startup said, with Taylor holding the chair position. Adam DAngelo, co-founder and CEO of question-and-answer startup Quora, will remain on the board. We are collaborating to figure out the details. Thank you so much for your patience through this, OpenAI said in the X post. On Monday, hundreds of employees, including co-founder and board member Ilya Sutskever, signed a letter saying that, if the board didnt resign and bring Altman back, the overwhelming majority would move to work with him at Microsoft. Satya Nadella, Microsofts CEO, said a post on X on Monday that Altman and his co-founder Greg Brockman would join Microsoft to form a new AI lab. That followed an announcement late Sunday that OpenAI had hired ex-Twitch CEO Emmett Shear as Altmans interim replacement. Originally, the board had said OpenAI technology chief Mira Murati would assume that role, but she soon joined the parade of employees calling for Altmans return. with the new board and w satyas support, im looking forward to returning to openai, and building on our strong partnership with msft, Altman wrote in a post of his own on X. Nadella applauded changes OpenAI has made to its board in his X post. We believe this is a first essential step on a path to more stable, well-informed, and effective governance, Nadella wrote. Sam, Greg, and I have talked and agreed they have a key role to play along with the OAI leadership team in ensuring OAI continues to thrive and build on its mission. We look forward to building on our strong partnership and delivering the value of this next generation of AI to our customers and partners. The rapid reinstatement of Altman began to look like a possibility on Saturday as news surfaced that a group of prominent investors, including Microsoft, Tiger Global, Thrive Capital and Sequoia Capital were working to reverse the boards decision from a day earlier. None of those firms had board seats, and they were caught unaware by the decision. In a post on X late Saturday night, Altman wrote, i love the openai team so much. Brockman, who quit the company after the board removed him as chairman alongside the ouster of Altman, reposted the comment with a heart symbol. Other OpenAI employees did the same. OpenAI, which was reportedly in talks as recently as last month to sell employee shares to investors at an 86 billion valuation, emerged as the hottest startup on the planet this year after releasing its ChatGPT chatbot in late 2022. ChatGPT allows users to input simple text queries and retrieve smart and creative answers that can lead to more in-depth conversations. Altman had been leading the company since 2019 and was serving as both the top executive of a high-flying company and the public face of artificial intelligence research and product development. Unlike most Silicon Valley startups, OpenAI wasnt structured like a typical corporation with large chunks of equity controlled by the founders. Rather, it was part of a nonprofit that was started in 2015. The board oversees the nonprofit, which acts as the overall governing body for all OpenAI activities, according to Fridays blog post. Sutskever and Brockman were both part of OpenAIs founding team. Original investors included Altman, LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman and Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who reportedly committed 1 billion to the project. Returning to OpenAI  getting back to coding tonight, Brockman wrote in an early Wednesday X post. Immediately after OpenAIs board announced Altmans firing, prominent Silicon Valley investors and founders loudly voiced their concerns and even compared the move to Apples decision 38 years ago to fire Steve Jobs. In 1997, Jobs would return and eventually lead Apple to create the iPhone and become the most valuable company in the U.S. What happened at OpenAI today is a Board coup that we have not seen the likes of since 1985 when the then-Apple board pushed out Steve Jobs, longtime startup investor Ron Conway said in an X post. It is shocking; it is irresponsible; and it does not do right by Sam  Greg or all the builders in OpenAI. Former Google CEO Eric Schmidt called Altman a hero of mine, who built a company that changed our collective world forever. Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky described Altman as one of the best founders of his generation. And venture capitalist Vinod Khosla said he is a once in a generation CEO. Nadella, who made a surprise appearance earlier this month at OpenAIs developer conference, was reportedly surprised and upset by the announcement. His company has invested billions of dollars in OpenAI and is a close technology partner, hosting hefty GPT workloads on its Azure cloud infrastructure. This was the pathway that maximized safety alongside doing right by all stakeholders involved, Shear said in an early Wednesday X post. Im glad to have been a part of the solution.

        "content": "A magnitude 6.7 earthquake struck northern Vanuatu on Wednesday, the United States Geological Survey said, with authorities warning that small tsunami waves had been picked up by ocean monitoring equipment. The quake had a depth of 22 kilometres (14 miles), hitting about 300 km north of the capital Port Vila at around 3:37 pm (0447 GMT). Centred near a sparsely populated cluster of islands, the USGS said there was a low likelihood of casualties and damage from the tremor. The Pacific Tsunami Warning Centre said people living in coastal Vanuatu areas near the quakes epicentre should be observant and exercise normal caution. Otherwise no action is required, the centre said. Vanuatus Meteorology and Geohazards Department warned residents in the northern provinces of Penama, Torba, Malampa and Sanma to take precautionary measures such as moving from the coast to higher ground. A hotel receptionist in Port Olry, some 98 km from the epicentre, told AFP she felt a little earthquake and saw the ground shaking but was not aware of any damage. Earthquakes are common in Vanuatu, a low-lying archipelago of 320,000 people that straddles the seismic Ring of Fire. The Ring of Fire is an arc of intense tectonic activity that stretches through Southeast Asia and across the Pacific basin.

        "content": "A dedicated allocation of Rs. 10 billion has been reserved for potential future elections, State Minister for Plantations, Enterprise Reforms and Finance, Ranjith Siyambalapitiya says. This provision, while not explicitly outlined in the budget proposals, has been included in the estimates, the lawmaker told addressing a press briefing held at the Presidential Media Centre (PMC) on Tuesday (21), under the theme One Way to a Stable Country. The state minister has conveyed that the Executive Committee of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) is scheduled to deliberate on the release of the second tranche of the extended credit facility to Sri Lanka on December 06. Speaking further, Siyambalapitiya highlighted the challenges faced in formulating this years budget. He underscored that in 2023, the governments revenue experienced a 16 decline from the targeted amount, a circumstance attributable to the prevailing negative economic conditions. Addressing the inherent limitations faced during the budget preparation, he acknowledged the constraints in pursuing objectives such as maintaining a robust primary account. State Minister Siyambalapitiya further made the following remarks: Moreover, in addressing the budget deficit, when expenditures surpassed income, resorting to borrowing became necessary. However, the forthcoming year presents a constrained borrowing environment, with limited space available. Previously, local borrowing was facilitated through various accessible means, but with the implementation of the new Central Bank Act, borrowing has been subject to restrictions. The government now has the authority to borrow only in response to sudden announcements by the Central Bank. Despite accusations labelling this years budget as an election-oriented one, it is crucial to recognize the imperative of responding to the challenges faced by a society under considerable strain. In such a context, it becomes obligatory to address the needs of those significantly impacted by economic adversity. We have allocated Rs. 10 billion for upcoming elections, although this provision was not formally presented in the budget proposals but has been factored into the estimates. Furthermore, it is essential to recognize that no nation has advanced without a sustainable stream of tax and government revenues. When we assumed these responsibilities, the tax structure was predominantly comprised of 80 indirect taxes and 20 direct taxes. Over time, we have strategically reduced the indirect tax rate, bringing the direct tax rate closer to 30. Additionally, the State Financial Management Responsibilities Act No. 03 of 2003 mandates maintaining the budget deficit at 5, a target that, in practice, has proven challenging. Over the last two decades, this target was achieved only in 2016 and 2017. Sustaining this requires a rigorous approach involving substantial expenditure reductions and revenue generation. Notably, public welfare expenditure, which stood at 65 billion, is projected to rise to 209 billion this year. Efforts are underway to implement practical reforms, including amendments to certain laws, to align legislation with operational realities. Activating dormant tax revenues is also a priority in our pursuit of fiscal sustainability. Moreover, there is a potential to elevate the state income ratio from its current 8.3 to 10.1 by the end of this year, and following the implementation of the 2024 budget, this ratio could further rise to 12.3 by the close of that year. Regardless of the political party in power, sustaining a nation necessitates the continual growth of state revenue. In a remarkably short period, we successfully alleviated the frustrations associated with the historical instability of the state. Concurrently, efforts are underway to enforce the Anti-Corruption Act, aligning with the commitments made under the agreement with the International Monetary Fund. Furthermore, plans are in place to conclude the electronic tax information gathering program and the Revenue Administration Management Information System 2.0 (RAMIS 2.0) project by the years end. The upcoming weeks are deemed pivotal for Sri Lankas economic trajectory. On December 6, the Executive Committee of the International Monetary Fund is set to convene and deliberate on the release of the second instalment of the extended credit facility. Furthermore, discussions and finalization of the proposal for the restructuring of bilateral debt are scheduled. --PMD",

        "date": "November 22, 2023 01:40 pm",
        "content": "A former Sri Lanka Army sniper has been arrested by the Criminal Investigation Department (CID), over his suspected involvement in the plot to help notorious underworld figure Harak Kata to escape from the custody of the CID. The 33-year-old suspect, a former Commando Sniper, was arrested by officers of the Criminal Investigations Department (CID) at Godagama in Matara, and has been handed over to the Terrorist Investigation Division (TID) for further investigations. On 10 September, Nadun Chinthaka, alias Harak Kata, who was being interrogated by eight CID officers, had reportedly laced the officers teas with poison during his questioning, with the help of a Police Constable, who is still evading arrest. The police officer in question, named Munipalage Ravindu Sandeepa Gunasekara, remains at large since 10 September. During the questioning, Harak Kata had allegedly requested to go to the washroom and was escorted out of the interrogation room with his accomplice  the police constable, and another sub-inspector attached to the Police Special Task Force (STF), assigned for the suspects protection. Although his handcuffs were removed at that point, the underworld kingpin had then walked out of the washroom acting as if he was still cuffed and had then attempted to snatch the STF officers firearm leading to a scuffle. A group of other CID officers were quick to arrive at the scene, upon hearing the commotion and managed to detain Harak Kata in their custody. Amidst the altercation, the constable in question had reportedly fled the CID premises and remains in hiding to date while certain reports have claimed that he is presumed to have fled the country. On 18 September, the mother and brother-in-law of the police constable in question were arrested. The police also obtained a 90-day detention order to interrogate them. Meanwhile, another Constable was arrested on 30 September on suspicion of his involvement in notorious underworld figure Harak Katas escape bid.",

        "title": "President addresses cricket crisis, voices concerns over criticizing judges inside parliament",
        "date": "November 22, 2023 02:08 pm",
        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe says Sri Lankan cricket crisis should be resolved by bringing in relevant laws to select the most suitable persons for the administration of the sport. Delivering a special statement in parliament earlier today (Nov.21), the Head of State refuted the claims alleging that he is protecting Shammi Silva, the President of Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) and other higher-ups in the cricket governing body. Saying that the countrys cricket ordeal is a longstanding issue, Wickremesinghe attributed the downfall of the sport to the power struggle between two groups. The President said he asked the Sports Minister not to get involved in a legal battle with the cricket administration, as it could lead to a ban from the International Cricket Council (ICC) and cause a setback in the countrys tourism. Speaking with regard to the backlash from certain individuals against the court judgments in respect of the cases filed over the cricket issue, Wickremesinghe slammed the Members of Parliament for criticizing the judges inside the parliament and said it is a concerning trend. We should let the judiciary perform its duties, and we should do ours. He also emphasized that the MPs should comply with the Standing Orders of the parliament, before unnecessarily criticizing the conduct of judges during the sittings. Commenting on the ICCs concerns about the unnecessary involvement of the government in Sri Lankan cricket, Wickremesinghe said accusations of political interference cannot be dismissed after the parliamentary members got together to bring forth a resolution against the SLC. Expressing his views further in this regard President Wickremesinghe said; To begin, I want to express my joy over the successful passage of the budgets second reading last night (21st). My sincere gratitude goes to the one hundred and twenty MPs who supported it, providing us with the strength to move forward. I extend my appreciation even to the 77 individuals who voted against us, as their dissent highlights the diversity of opinions within this House. MP Lakshman Kiriella suggested that the court can now hold rulers accountablean idea I initiated. I urge you not to oppose me, as our collective efforts have fortified democracy. Therefore, I kindly request your support, at least for this budgetary proposal. Regarding the former president, who is a lawyer handling his legal matters, I emphasize our commitment to democracy. If he is innocent, he will be acquitteda testament to the democratic principles we have instilled in our country. I am planning to conduct both presidential and parliamentary elections next year, followed by provincial councils and local government elections the following year. In response to a recent question from the leader of the opposition, I want to highlight that I have received a report indicating that the Attorney General has filed a case against ABC Enterprises, Thyagaraja Vinayamoorthy, M.P.D.U.K. Mapa Pathirana, and 24 others. The case has been filed to address the alleged violation of the petitioners human rights in connection to the awarding of the dry food and bread supply tender to ABC Enterprises for the Trincomalee prison in 2023 and 2024. The petitioner seeks compensation of Rs. 2.5 million. I can inquire with the Attorney General to provide the specific information required for this matter. The report I received indicates a violation of a fundamental right, emphasizing insufficient evidence for a criminal case during that period. It suggests adherence to separate rules. It is crucial to address this issue, particularly concerning the matter of Public Trust. The report implies that the former president did not take necessary actions, necessitating a comprehensive analysis of events following that period. In our tradition, when the leader of the opposition is invited to form a government and has the majority, they usually proceed. However, our opposition leader did not follow this tradition, constituting a breach of public trust. The premiership I assumed that day was not granted by the Rajapaksas; but several MPs approached me, and I accepted the responsibility to restore the country. I sought everyones support based on public trust. While undertaking this responsibility, my residence was set ablaze, and the parliament was raided. Despite calls for my resignation, I stated that I would step down if anyone with a majority emerged. During the siege of the parliament, when the army commander arrived, party leaders fled. Ultimately, I instructed the army commander to take any necessary measures to safeguard the parliament. A thorough examination of these events will reveal who is responsible and who is not. I emphasize the need to avoid unnecessary delays, but if there is a desire to proceed, lets thoroughly investigate the entire situation. Speaking about cricket, I want to address accusations of protecting individuals. The cricket issue has been a long-standing challenge, with its decline attributed to a struggle between two groups. To address this, we consistently advocated for the enactment of a law and the selection of the right team based on that law. To facilitate this, we utilized the Chitrasiri report as a foundation for the proposed law. On a specific occasion, I cautioned the minister against handling a case in a way that could lead to consequences such as losing the International Cricket Council (ICC) membership, forfeiting matches, and deterring tourists. During cabinet discussions, the minister sought legal representation, and we, including the former president and the Attorney General, urged the Attorney General to represent him. Subsequently, the case concluded, and I plan to request a report from the minister to understand the details. While unsure of the courts verdict, I believe that in cases with disputes, decisions should be sought from the court. Regarding the current situation, I conversed with the ICC, and they expressed concerns about political interference, emphasizing the need for a law rather than defending individuals. Currently facing two charges, one pertains to the dissolution of the Cricket Board by this council, which awaits a legal verdict. The other alleges parliamentary involvement, as the opposition swiftly approved the decision when the minister announced it. I emphasize the presence of politics in this matter. Acknowledging mistakes, our representative, Mr. Nimal Siripala de Silva, apologized to the judges, recognizing our wrongdoing. Despite the judges rebuke, blaming them was unwarranted. The temporary order could have been addressed the next day if necessary. Its a common occurrence, and accusing the judges individually is unjustified. Importantly, the Chief Justice, not I, selected and appointed Rajakaruna as the President of the Court of Appeal. However, this cannot be permitted. Launching attacks under the guise of parliamentary privileges is unacceptable. There is no privilege in this context. According to the standing orders, the proposal did not receive approval. Each branch of government has its own distinct responsibilitiesthe court performs its functions, and so does the council. I consistently emphasize that Article 04 of the Constitution should remain inviolable. I have refrained from blaming judges directly. While we can critique judgments, accusing a judge should be done following standing orders; otherwise, claims of privileges are unwarranted. Placing the council in such a situation is unprecedented and regrettable. In the past, we took action against Neville Samarakoon. Initially, we invoked standing orders to discuss his actions. Mr. Rakava, who collaborated with us in the United National Party in the 70s, was endorsed by President Premadasa to stand for a vote and later served as the vice-chairman of this council. It is perplexing why we are attacking someone President Premadasa trusted and someone I appointed as an ambassador to Vietnam. I know him personally, and I doubt his involvement in questionable activities. It saddens me to witness criticism against him and his son, considering their past association with us. On a particular day, these individuals visited the presidents House, and we took a photograph. If anyone in this House desires a copy, I am willing to provide it; its not an issue for me. Lets refrain from such actions. My focus is on adhering to standing orders. Engaging in conflicts with the judiciary is not the solution. Its essential to recognize that the Legislative Council is distinct from Parliament; it is a part of the executive. Their role involves supporting the president in appointments, assessing the suitability of names, and making suggestions. Any activity can be subject to a fundamental rights case. This aspect should be kept in mind. We introduced the Anti-Corruption Commission Act, and Ive been awaiting the names of the Commissioners for three months now. Despite our discussions on combating corruption, the appointment of the Commission members is delayed due to concerns raised by a few individuals. We sought the advice of the Attorney General, emphasizing that even if there is a minor issue, they should send the names for appointments. I am willing to face any legal challenges, and if we were truly committed to eradicating corruption, we could have proceeded with these appointments. The delay in this process hampers the effective functioning of the legislative assembly. To address this issue, I propose the establishment of a selection committee to discuss the way forward. The current situation has created a backlog in the courts, and I suggest the Prime Minister initiate discussions to form a selection committee to determine future procedures. Moreover, the primary purpose of this assembly is to pass laws. We often commence work late, and people do not pay us to merely perform; they expect us to pass legislation. Therefore, I recommend discussing with the cabinet the introduction of a new amendment, suggesting that we shift to the main agenda after the first hour. Many new laws are anticipated next year, and further delays are impractical. Considering that MPs will need to return to their constituencies for development work next year, it is crucial not to get stuck here. Therefore, my suggestion is to prioritize the main legislative work after the first hour. I wanted to clarify these points, and if the opposition wishes to provide additional insights on this matter, it can be appropriately addressed.",

        "date": "November 22, 2023 02:52 pm",
        "content": "The government of Japan has provided grant assistance amounting to LKR 770 million to support Sri Lankas fisheries sector and the field of meteorology. Accordingly, a grant assistance adding up to JPY 160 million (approximately LKR 335 million) has been committed to the Project for the Establishment of Doppler Weather Radar Network in Sri Lanka. In 2017, the Japanese government had granted more than LKR 3.4 billion through JICA for the same project. The purpose of this grant was to mitigate effectively the disasters caused by hazardous meteorological phenomena through the improvement of weather forecasts and information disseminated by the Department of Meteorology. Now, as a supplementary grant assistance of about LKR 335 million has been earmarked for the provision of Very Small Aperture Terminal (VSAT) which is an essential part for securing reliable data communication especially in severe disaster situations where extreme rains, lightning, landslides etc. can disrupt conventional communication. This grant assistance is expected to be a great patronage to strengthen resilience and adaptive capacity to response of the Meteorology Department to natural disasters. Additionally, the Japanese government, under its Economic and Social Development Program, has allocated a grant assistance of JPY 200 million (approximately LKR 435 million) for providing supportive equipment for the fisheries industry in Sri Lanka. The objective of this grant aid to develop cold chain facilities and equip the fisheries sector with modern electronic equipment and, thereby realizing high value-added marine products and contributing to the upgrading the living standard of the fishermen in Northern and Eastern provinces of Sri Lanka. Under this Grant assistance, ice making machines, digital platform scales, sets of fishing net, refrigerator truck and prefabricated refrigeratorsfreezers are to be provided. This grant assistance is expected to be a great patronage to reduce the constraints that exist in the value chain and increase the competitiveness, by promoting private sector investments in the fisheries industry. Exchange of Note pertaining to the aforementioned grants were signed by Treasury Secretary Mahinda Siriwardana and Ambassador of Japan to Sri Lanka Mizukoshi Hideaki, with the participation of Douglas Devananda, Fisheries Minister; Shehan Semasinghe, State Minister for Finance; and Yamada Tetsuya, Chief Representative of JICAs office in Sri Lanka.",

        "date": "November 22, 2023 03:52 pm",
        "content": "The case filed pertaining to the Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) Interim Committee is due to be taken up for further consideration before the Court of Appeal on 23 November. On 16 November, the Court of Appeal issued an order that the relevant case be taken up before a new panel of judges after Judge Neil Iddawela recused himself from the case. The case was subsequently forwarded to the President of the Court of Appeal, Judge Nissanka Bandula Karunaratne, in order to name a new panel of Judges. Thus, the case was slated to be heard before an Appellate Court bench comprising of Judges Sobhitha Rajakaruna and D. N. Samarkoon, as per a decision made by the President of the Court of Appeal. So far, three Judges, including the Appeals Court President and Judge Neil Iddawela, have recused themselves from the hearing of the relevant case. On 07 November, the Court of Appeal issued a 14-day stay order, preventing the operation of the seven-member Interim Committee appointed SLC and the relevant gazette notification issued by Sports Minister Roshan Ranasinghe in this regard. The relevant order was issued by a two-member judge bench consisting of Appeals Court President Nissanka Bandula Karunaratne and Justice Vikum Kaluarachchi, upon consideration of a writ petition filed by the Chairman of SLC Shammi Silva. Accordingly, the court has issued three stay orders in total pertaining to the matter: the first to prevent the gazette issued by the Sports Minister appointing the interim committee for the SLC, the second to prevent the committee members chaired by Arjuna Ranatunga from acting in their respective positions and the third to prevent the respondents including the Sports Minister from interfering the activities of the petitioner and the other officials of cricket board. Subsequently, on 13 November, Sports Minister Roshan Ranasinghe filed a motion requesting the lifting of the stay order issued by the Court of Appeal preventing the operation of the 7-member Interim Committee appointed by him for the SLC and the relevant gazette notification published in this regard. The motion including the objections related to the relevant stay order, has been filed before the Appeals Court through Attorney-at-Law G.G. Arulpragasam. A seven-member Interim Committee was appointed by Sports Minister Roshan Ranasinghe on 06 November, chaired by World Cup-winning former Sri Lanka captain Arjuna Ranatunga. The interim committee consists of the following members: S. I. Imam, Retired Supreme Court Judge; Rohini Marasinghe, Retired Supreme Court Judge; Irangani Perera, Retired High Court Judge; Arjuna Ranatunga (Chairman); Upali Dharmadasa; Rakitha Rajapakshe, Attorney-at-Law; and Hisham Jamaldeen.",

Speaking at a special press briefing held this afternoon (23 Nov.), Silva clarified that albeit the suspension, Sri Lanka retains the right to host bilateral cricket tournaments and is also allowed to play both bilateral and ICC tournaments. Silva also mentioned that payments for Sri Lanka contract players will continue as usual while the suspension is in place. At an earlier press briefing, the SLC President warned that in the event the ICC does not lift the ongoing suspension against the countrys membership, the country stands to lose USD 50 million. Addressing todays press briefing, however, Silva stated that consequent to ICCs suspension, Sri Lanka stands at a loss of about Rs. 100 million. On 10 November, the ICC suspended SLCs membership with immediate effect, on account of the governing body having been in serious breach of its obligations as a Member, in particular, the requirement to manage its affairs autonomously and ensure that there is no government interference in the governance, regulation andor administration of cricket in Sri Lanka.",

        "content": "Minister of Transport and Highways Bandula Gunawardena has slammed the token strike launched by the expressway employees this morning (Nov.22) as a deliberate attempt at incurring a loss to the government. This is not a trade union action, but a subversive move, the lawmaker said addressing the parliamentary session earlier today. The All-Island Expressway Workers Union resorted to a token strike at 7 a.m. today by calling in sick. The trade union action is based on 3 key issues: the alleged attempts by the Finance Ministry and Road Development Authority (RDA) to privatize the countrys expressway network, delayed payments for unused sick leave for the year 2022 and the delayed approval for the System for Optimized Recruitment (SOR) which deferred the grade-to-grade promotions of all employees. Gunawardena claimed that employees on strike have taken the ticketing machines with them, in a bid to disrupt the expressway operations. Resorting to such moves against the backdrop of an economic crisis is a serious crime, he said, while commending the efforts of the security forces to keep expressway operation uninterrupted amidst the trade union action. Soon after the expressway employees launched their token strike, tri-forces and police personnel were dispatched to ensure the security and issue tickets.",

Israels Ambassador to the Vatican Raphael Schutz said he did not want to refer directly to what the pope had said but added: There is a simple distinction, one side is murdering, raping, and does not care about those on their own side. The other side is engaged in a war of self-defence. Schutz was speaking at a news conference with Israeli families who had met the pope. Most said they were not aware of the popes comments because they happened after the meeting. Palestinian families were to hold a news conference later on Wednesday. During the general audience, a group of Palestinians in the crowd held up pictures of bodies wrapped in white cloth and a placard saying the Nakba continues. Nakba is the Arab word for catastrophe and refers to the displacement and dispossession of Palestinians in the 1948 war that surrounded Israels founding. The meetings and the popes comments came hours after Israel and Hamas agreed to a ceasefire in Gaza for at least four days to allow in aid and release at least 50 hostages captured by militants in exchange for at least 150 Palestinians jailed in Israel. Israel has placed Gaza under siege and relentless bombardment since Hamas militants attacked southern Israeli towns on Oct. 7, killing 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking around 240 hostages, according to Israeli tallies. Since then, more than 14,000 Gazans have been killed, about 40 of them children, according to medical officials in the Hamas-ruled territory, figures deemed reliable by the United Nations.

        "date": "November 22, 2023 10:48 pm",
        "content": "Minister of Foreign Affairs Presidents Counsel Ali Sabry has emphasised the imperative need for a comprehensive, long-term targeted program as the primary solution to address the economic crisis facing the country. Minister Ali Sabry underscored the complexity of the economic challenges and stressed that short-term fixes would not suffice, highlighting the necessity for strategic planning and sustained efforts to achieve economic stability. The Minister also noted the imperative of trapping tax evaders in the tax net to ensure the countrys continued status as a welfare state. In this regard, a program is slated for implementation this year to enhance tax compliance. The Minister made these remarks during a press briefing held at the Presidential Media Centre (PMC) today (22 Nov.), under the theme One Way to a Stable Country. Minister Ali Sabry provided an overview of positive economic progress. Notable achievements include a substantial reduction in inflation from 70 to -2.5 and a 100 increase in tourist arrivals. These indicators, according to the Minister, affirm that the country is moving in the right direction economically. The Minister stressed that as politicians, they have the authority to make diverse decisions. Nonetheless, it is the citizens of this country who must shoulder the resulting burdens. To propel the nation beyond its current challenges, it must attract new investments and foster job creation. It is imperative to integrate the creative youth community into the job market. It is noteworthy that this years budget has been formulated with these objectives in mind, particularly with a forward-looking perspective. Furthermore, the 2024 budget is designed to set the country on a course toward a new economic paradigm. Additionally, Minister Ali Sabry highlighted substantial funds have been allocated for digitization, the modernization of agriculture, and education. In the execution of these initiatives, it is imperative to steer clear of bureaucratic obstacles and promote collaborative efforts. Key decisions include granting rights to individuals in flats and rented houses, as well as providing land rights to farmers. Emphasizing fiscal responsibility, Minister Ali Sabry noted that 70 of this years budget has been earmarked for loan instalments and interest payments. He drew attention to Sri Lankas position as the 8th country with the lowest taxes globally, emphasizing the need to focus on bringing tax evaders into the system. Among the countries above us are Haiti, Somalia, Sudan, Iran, Venezuela and Nigeria. To address this, the focus should be on identifying and apprehending those attempting to evade taxes, with an emphasis on restoring transparency. The implementation of a dedicated program for this purpose is planned to commence this year. These measures are essential not only to ensure free education, healthcare and other facilities at an elevated standard but also to alleviate the burdens on the people. It is crucial to recognize that there are no quick fixes for the economic crisis in the country. A viable way forward involves the implementation of a comprehensive, long-term targeted program.",

        "date": "November 22, 2023 11:14 pm",
        "content": "A temporary truce between Hamas and Israel will begin at 10am on Thursday, a senior Hamas official said on Wednesday. The majority of the 50 hostages to be released from Gaza hold foreign citizenship, Musa Abu Mazrouq told Al Jazeera. He said the hostages were being held in Palestinian homes, rather than prisons. Israeli Foreign Minister Eli Cohen said earlier on Wednesday he expected the first hostages to be released on Thursday. The process to begin recovering the hostages will begin first thing tomorrow morning, Mr Cohen told Israels army radio on Wednesday afternoon, but would not comment on exact timing. Israeli ministers have been briefed that the deal will be implemented tomorrow, the countrys media reported. Hamas was expected to give names of the first 10 hostages to be released late on Wednesday, Israels Kan public broadcaster reported, saying the deal will allow the release of 30 children, 12 mothers and eight elderly women. Israel, in turn, is expected to inform Hamas which prisoners will be released each day. After six hours of deliberation, the Israeli cabinet voted to accept a four-day temporary pause in a deal with Hamas after mounting pressure from hostages families protesting across Israel in recent weeks. The Israeli government said the deal included the release of 50 hostages held in Gaza. At least 50 hostages  women and children  will be released over four days, during which a pause in the fighting will be held, the government said. The release of every additional 10 hostages will result in one additional day in the pause. Israels statement made no mention of Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails being released though according to the government of Qatar, who helped to negotiate the deal, the hostages will be released in exchange for a number of Palestinian women and children detained in Israeli prisons. Qatar said the start time of the temporary pause in fighting would be announced within 24 hours. As part of the deal, Israel will allow a larger number of humanitarian convoys and relief aid, including fuel designated for humanitarian needs into the Gaza Strip. After the announcement of the agreement, the Israeli government released a statement on its future intentions for the conflict. The Israeli government is committed to bringing all the abductees home, the statement said. It added: The Israeli government, the military and the security forces will continue the war to return all the abductees, complete the elimination of Hamas and ensure that Gaza does not renew any threat to the state of Israel. Qatars Foreign Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman welcomed the agreement on X. We thank our partners who contributed to reaching the humanitarian pause agreement in Gaza, particularly the US and Egypt, he said. US President Joe Biden also welcomed the agreement. I am extraordinarily gratified that some of these brave souls, who have endured weeks of captivity and an unspeakable ordeal, will be reunited with their families once this deal is fully implemented, he said. Todays deal should bring home additional American hostages, and I will not stop until they are all released. Hostage release to take place in five stages Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahus office has devised a process for the hostages to be released and transferred to the countrys authorities, Channel 12 reported on Tuesday. First, Hamas will hand over the hostages to the Red Cross and they will be transferred to representatives from the Israeli military. Authorities will then conduct medical checks on the hostages before taking them to medical centres across Israel to be reunited with their families. The fourth stage will include medical and defence authorities working together to determine whether any of the hostages can be debriefed. Those hostages will then undergo a debriefing with security officials. Six hospitals in Israel are ready to receive people freed as part of the hostage deal. They will be cared for in designated compounds, separate from other patients and the media. Once released, the hostages will be received at Sheba Medical Centre in Tel Hashomer, Shamir Medical Centre, Wolfson, Soroka and Ichilov hospitals, and the Schneider Childrens Medical Centre. Mr Netanyahu said the agreement included access for the Red Cross to those who would remain hostage in Gaza and that they would have access to any medicine they needed. Israel-Gaza conflict moves to a new standpoint If successful, this will mark the largest release of hostages since Hamas militants conducted a deadly assault on Israeli soil more than a month ago, killing about 1,200 people and abducting about 240. The attack has fuelled Israels retaliatory bombardment and ground incursion of the Gaza Strip. If it holds, the ceasefire will be the longest period in the war without fighting between Israeli forces and militants. Israels military has engaged in ground operations and an aerial bombardment since the October 7 attack, resulting in at least 14,000 deaths, according to local tallies. It is reported that hostages include Israelis and citizens from other countries. Four hostages have been released since the day of the attack, two Americans and two Israelis. The International Committee of the Red Cross has assisted in the release of the hostages. Source - The National - With input from agencies",

        "date": "November 23, 2023 10:24 am",
        "content": "A speeding car crashed in flames on the bridge linking New York state and Ontario at Niagara Falls on Wednesday, killing two people in the vehicle and sparking a security scare that closed four U.S.-Canadian border crossings. Hours later, federal and state authorities said investigators had found no evidence of an act of terrorism, though circumstances surrounding the crash on the Rainbow Bridge remained murky, leaving it to be determined whether it was accidental or intentional. At this time, there is no indication of a terrorist attack or threat to the public, New York Governor Kathy Hochul told reporters on Wednesday evening. Her comments were echoed by federal and local law enforcement officials at a separate news conference. The FBI said in a statement it had concluded its investigation. A search of the scene revealed no explosive materials, and no terrorism nexus was identified, the FBI said in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter. Video of the crash caught on security camera and posted to X by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agency showed the car traveling from the U.S. side at high speed, then hitting an object and flying into the air before crashing to the ground and exploding in flames. The driver and a passenger perished in the wreck, and a CBP officer suffered minor injuries. He was treated at a hospital and released, an agency official said later. Authorities did not identify the two people killed. CNN reported the driver was a 56-year-old man who was traveling in a Bentley automobile with his wife to attend a concert by the rock group KISS. A performance of the band scheduled for Wednesday in Toronto as part of the groups farewell tour was canceled after one of its members, Paul Stanley, came down with flu. The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said on its website the Buffalo Niagara International Airport had closed, but Hochul said there were no interruptions. Heightened Alert The crash unfolded at a time of heightened security concerns around the world stemming from the conflict in the Middle East and at the peak of U.S. holiday travel on the eve of Thanksgiving celebrations. The Rainbow Bridge and all three other border crossings along the Niagara River between western New York and the Canadian province of Ontario - the Peace Bridge, the Lewiston-Queenston Bridge and the Whirlpool Bridge - were shut for several hours as a precaution. Other international crossings remained open on heightened alert status, the governor said. Security measures were escalated at other airports and railways managed by the Niagara-Frontier Transit Authority, as well as at various locations around New York City, officials said. The three bridges that were not involved were reopened early Wednesday evening, but the Rainbow crossing remained closed during the investigation and as officials assessed the crossings safety. Hochul said the car that crashed sailed over an 8-foot-tall fence before landing in a fireball that incinerated the vehicle, leaving little but the engine visibly intact and scattering debris over more than a dozen security booths on the bridge. Witness Mike Guenther told Buffalo television station WGRZ-TV that he was walking near the bridge with his wife when the car, traveling at high speed, struck a fence at the crossing and was catapulted into the air before exploding. He was flying, over 100 miles an hour, said Guenther, who was visiting from Kitchener, Ontario. He said the vehicle, which he described as a luxury sedan, was fish-tailing out of control before it crashed. It was a ball of fire, 30 or 40 feet high, never seen anything like it, said Guenther.

        "title": "President Ranil insists Jay Shah doesnt run Sri Lankan cricket",
        "date": "November 23, 2023 10:46 am",
        "content": "Former Sri Lanka captain Arjuna Ranatungas comments on BCCI secretary Jay Shah running Sri Lankan cricket has caused a major storm across the cricketing world, especially in cricket-mad India which happens to be a superpower of the sport. The comments have caused uproar to the point that Sri Lanka President Ranil Wickremesinghe himself offered an apology In an exclusive conversation with Firstposts Palki Sharma, President Wickremesinghe revealed that he has since had a conversation with Shah on the matter. No, Jay Shah doesnt run Sri Lankan cricket. They think that Jay Shah is supporting the cricket board. But I spoke to Jay Shah and felt sorry that his name had been dragged in and apologized. He said, My position is, whoever is the legal body, I will back. If this lot is the legal body I will back them. If the other lot is the legal body, I will back them. If theres a third group thats the legal body, I will back them. Thats not decided by me, thats decided by ICC, Wickremesinghe said. Ranatunga had made the comments a day after the ICCs suspension of Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC), the richest sporting body in the crisis-stricken island nation, due to political interference. Because of the connection between SLC officials and Jay Shah, they (the BCCI) are under the impression that they can trample and control SLC. Jay Shah is running Sri Lanka Cricket. SLC is being ruined because of pressure from Jay Shah. One man in India is ruining Sri Lankan cricket. He is only powerful because of his father, who is Indias home minister, Ranatunga, who led Sri Lanka to their only ICC World Cup triumph in 1996, was quoted as saying by Sri Lankan media. The unrest in Sri Lankan cricket began after its 302-run mauling at the hands of India in Mumbais Wankhede Stadium. The manner in which the Kusal Mendis-led side had been outplayed, getting bowled out for 55, led to Sri Lanka sports minister Roshan Ranasinghe sacking the entire SLC board shortly after and naming an interim committee with Ranatunga as the head. Sri Lankas Court of Appeals, however, stayed Ranasinghes decision and allowed the Shammi Silva-led board to continue with their daily functioning. It is widely believed that the SLC itself had approached ICC to recommend its suspension due to government interference. The Sri Lankan parliament has unanimously passed a resolution moved by chief opposition leader Sajith Premadasa calling for the entire board to resign. The ICC confirmed its suspension of SLC following its meeting in Ahmedabad on Tuesday, and consequently shifted the 2024 U-19 World Cup out of the country and to South Africa. Reacting to the ICCs decision, President Wickremesinghe added he knew the countrys board was going to get suspended. The opposition has said that the Board of Control has written to the ICC and has said to suspend Sri Lanka. The leader of the opposition gave me a set of letters, I havent looked at it. But ICC was going to suspend Sri Lanka, I knew that. We were trying to save the U-19 matches, we were going to have tourism, but that didnt work out so we lost on all that. I am waiting to see the outcome or the decision of the courts in regard to the interim committee. Once that is done, well have to start talking with the ICC to ensure that Sri Lanka can host matches again. As far as the cricket board is concerned, there is a committee of ministers that are going to it, which will recommend legislation. Theyve spoken to the board members as well as to the interim committee members, but I want to bring legislation which will take away the power of the minister to intervene and interfere in politics, Wickremesinghe added.

When asked about his meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi last year, Wickremesinghe said, I have known Narendra Modi since he was a Chief Minister. Our vision was a step forward. We talked about trade and investment. He also highlighted Indias help when the country underwent an economic crisis last year. In May, India extended a 1bn credit line for Sri Lanka by a year. The credit line is part of the 4bn in emergency assistance extended by India. Talking about the upcoming general election in India, the Sri Lankan president said, Lets see what the state elections say. BJP has the advantage, it is a single party led by a single leader. Sri Lanka must live with what happens in New Delhi. Commenting on the current economy in Sri Lanka, Wickremesinghe said, We are not out of the woods yet but will come out. We still have to balance the budget and trade and increase our revenues. I hope things will get better in 2024-2025. We cant go on in traditional mode and need a new economy.

The state minister says the decision to hold him accountable for the entire incident while allowing Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa and SJB MP Nalin Bandara to go unpunished is a violation of his parliamentary privileges. The Parliamentarian was suspended from parliament for a period of two weeks on Wednesday (22 Nov.), consequent to his unruly behavior inside the Chambers on 21 November.

        "title": "No Gaza hostage release before Friday, Israel and US say",
        "date": "November 23, 2023 01:15 pm",
        "content": "(Reuters) - The release of hostages under a temporary truce between Israel and Palestinian Hamas militants will not happen before Friday, Israels national security adviser and the U.S. said, dashing hopes of relatives that some would be freed on Thursday. Israel and Hamas agreed early on Wednesday to a ceasefire in Gaza for at least four days, to let in humanitarian aid and free at least 50 hostages held by militants in the enclave in exchange for at least 150 Palestinians jailed in Israel. The starting time of the truce and release of hostages captured by Hamas during its Oct. 7 attack on Israel has yet to be officially announced. An Egyptian security source said mediators had sought a start time of 10 a.m. (0800 GMT) on Thursday. Speaking on Thursday morning, Qatars foreign ministry spokesperson Majid bin Mohammed Al Ansari said an announcement on the beginning of the truce could come in the next few hours. Qatar has been mediating in the negotiations on the truce. The negotiations on the release of our hostages are advancing and continuing constantly, Israeli National Security Adviser Tzachi Hanegbi said in a statement released by the prime ministers office. The start of the release will take place according to the original agreement between the sides, and not before Friday, it said. White House spokesperson Adrienne Watson said final logistical details for the release were being worked out. That is on track and we are hopeful that implementation will begin on Friday morning, Watson said. But there was no let-up in the fighting early on Thursday, reports said. Palestinian media said Israeli aircraft and artillery struck Gazas southern city of Khan Younis in at least two waves and 15 people were killed. Attacks were also reported in several other parts of Gaza, including the Jabalia and Nuseirat camps. Israel said its forces carried out aerial strikes on over 300 Hamas targets over the past day. Reuters was unable to independently verify the reports. In Israel, sirens warning of incoming rocket fire from Gaza blared in communities near the border with the enclave, the military said. There were no reports of damage or injuries. Israels public broadcaster Kan, citing an unidentified Israeli official, reported there was a 24-hour delay in the truce because the agreement was not signed by Hamas and mediator Qatar. The official said they were optimistic the agreement would be carried out when it was signed. No one said there would be a release tomorrow except the media ... We had to make it clear that no release is planned before Friday, because of the uncertainty that hostages families are facing, Kan quoted a source in Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahus office as saying. Israeli media, citing anonymous officials, reported the pause in fighting with Hamas also would not start before Friday. Israels Ynet news website reported that Israel had not yet received the names of the hostages slated for release by Hamas. Since the Hamas attack on southern Israel that surprised the government and shocked Israelis, five hostages have been recovered alive. Israel says 1,200 people were killed, mostly civilians and about 240 hostages of different nationalities taken hostage by Islamist gunmen. In retaliation, Israel has subjected Hamas-ruled Gaza to a siege and relentless bombardment. More than 14,000 Gazans have been killed, around 40 of them children, according to medical officials in the territory. NEED TO KNOW THEY ARE ALIVE Netanyahu made no mention of a potential delay in implementation of the agreement during a press conference late on Wednesday. Hanegbis statement was released about an hour after the press conference. We need to know they are alive, if theyre okay. Its the minimum, said Gilad Korngold, who said he drew just a measure of comfort from the deal between Israel and Hamas and was among those who was still awaiting word of relatives. Seven of his family members, including his 3-year-old granddaughter, were taken hostage. I want everybody back. But I think - and its a very tough decision - but I think the children and women must be (first). They are most fragile...they need to get out. The U.S. also hoped that aid would begin reaching Gaza in large volumes within the next few days, White House national security spokesperson John Kirby said. The 50 hostages would be released over four days at a rate of at least 10 daily, Netanyahus office said. The truce could be extended day by day so long as an additional 10 hostages were freed each day, it said. Israels justice ministry published a list of 300 names of Palestinian prisoners who could be freed. Hamas said the initial 50 hostages would be released in exchange for 150 Palestinian women and children imprisoned in Israel. Hundreds of trucks of humanitarian, medical and fuel supplies would enter Gaza, while Israel would halt all air sorties over southern Gaza and maintain a daily six-hour daytime no-fly window in the north, Hamas said. The truce agreement, the first in a nearly seven-week-long war, was reached after mediation by Qatar and seen by governments around the world as potentially easing the suffering of civilians in the Gaza Strip. Gaza is the most dangerous place in the world to be a child, Catherine Russell, head of the United Nations childrens agency UNICEF, told the U.N. Security Council on Wednesday. More than 5,300 Palestinian children had reportedly been killed since Oct. 7, Russell said. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "date": "November 23, 2023 01:23 pm",
        "content": "The Court of Appeal on Thursday (23 Nov.) decided to once again postpone the further hearing of the case filed pertaining to the Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) Interim Committee. Accordingly, the case is due to be taken up for further hearing before the Appellate Court on 24 November, marking the third consecutive time that the relevant hearing has been postponed to the next day. On 16 November, the Court of Appeal issued an order that the relevant case be taken up before a new panel of judges after Judge Neil Iddawela recused himself from the case. The case was subsequently forwarded to the President of the Court of Appeal, Judge Nissanka Bandula Karunaratne, in order to name a new panel of Judges. Thus, the case was slated to be heard before an Appellate Court bench comprising of Judges Sobhitha Rajakaruna and D. N. Samarkoon, as per a decision made by the President of the Court of Appeal. So far, three Judges, including the Appeals Court President and Judge Neil Iddawela, have recused themselves from the hearing of the relevant case. On 07 November, the Court of Appeal issued a 14-day stay order, preventing the operation of the seven-member Interim Committee appointed SLC and the relevant gazette notification issued by Sports Minister Roshan Ranasinghe in this regard. The relevant order was issued by a two-member judge bench consisting of Appeals Court President Nissanka Bandula Karunaratne and Justice Vikum Kaluarachchi, upon consideration of a writ petition filed by the Chairman of SLC Shammi Silva. Accordingly, the court has issued three stay orders in total pertaining to the matter: the first to prevent the gazette issued by the Sports Minister appointing the interim committee for the SLC, the second to prevent the committee members chaired by Arjuna Ranatunga from acting in their respective positions and the third to prevent the respondents including the Sports Minister from interfering the activities of the petitioner and the other officials of cricket board. Subsequently, on 13 November, Sports Minister Roshan Ranasinghe filed a motion requesting the lifting of the stay order issued by the Court of Appeal preventing the operation of the 7-member Interim Committee appointed by him for the SLC and the relevant gazette notification published in this regard. The motion including the objections related to the relevant stay order, has been filed before the Appeals Court through Attorney-at-Law G.G. Arulpragasam. A seven-member Interim Committee was appointed by Sports Minister Roshan Ranasinghe on 06 November, chaired by World Cup-winning former Sri Lanka captain Arjuna Ranatunga. The interim committee consists of the following members: S. I. Imam, Retired Supreme Court Judge; Rohini Marasinghe, Retired Supreme Court Judge; Irangani Perera, Retired High Court Judge; Arjuna Ranatunga (Chairman); Upali Dharmadasa; Rakitha Rajapakshe, Attorney-at-Law; and Hisham Jamaldeen.",

        "title": "Binance sees 956 million in outflows after Zhao steps down to settle US probe",
        "date": "November 23, 2023 01:27 pm",
        "content": "(Reuters) - Investors pulled about 956 million from crypto exchange Binance over the past 24 hours, market data showed, after its chief, Changpeng Zhao, stepped down and faced prison time after pleading guilty on Tuesday to settle a years-long U.S. illicit finance probe. The deal, in which Binance will pay 4.3 billion to U.S. authorities, raises questions over the future of the worlds largest crypto exchange and marks another blow for an industry beset by scandals. Zhao has been replaced by Richard Teng, a senior Binance executive who joined in 2021, the company said. It remained unclear on Wednesday how much jail time, if any, Zhao would ultimately serve, and how much influence he - as Binances founder and major shareholder - could continue to exert on Binance under the terms of the settlement. Some analysts also noted that the deal was unlikely to end the exchanges U.S. legal woes, with Securities and Exchange Commission charges alleging Binance broke U.S. securities laws still unresolved. Binance is not entirely out of the woods. The ongoing civil lawsuit with the SEC remains a concern for the exchange, which (is) likely to result in further fines, wrote Robert Le, a crypto analyst at data firm PitchBook. Data from crypto analytics platform Nansen, which does not include bitcoin flows, signaled some investors had been rattled by the news, pulling 956 million from the exchange. Still, the outflows were small relative to the more than 65 billion of assets that remain on Binance, Nansen said. As it strived for market dominance, Binance shunned key checks Zhao believed would turn customers off, authorities said. It failed to report more than 100,000 suspicious transactions, including with organizations the U.S. described as terrorist groups such as Palestinian militant group Hamas, and never reported transactions with websites dedicated to selling child sexual abuse materials. Binance did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but said on Tuesday it had worked hard to make Binance safer and even more secure. Lawyers for Zhao did not respond to requests for comment on Wednesday. On Tuesday, he conceded I made mistakes, and I must take responsibility. PRISON TIME While authorities have probed Zhao and Binance since at least 2018, Zhaos exit marks a dramatic development for one of the most powerful figures in the crypto industry. Zhao, who resides in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), entered his plea in a Seattle court on Tuesday. He faces a maximum prison sentence of 18 months under federal guidelines and has agreed not to appeal any sentence up to that length. Prosecutors will take a position on how much jail time to seek closer to Zhaos Feb. 23 sentencing hearing in Seattle, a Justice Department spokesperson said on Wednesday. But we do reserve the right to seek a sentence above the guidelines. Zhao paid a 175 million bail bond, with another 15 million held in a trust account, a court filing showed. He has agreed to return to the United States 14 days before sentencing. Reuters could not immediately ascertain his whereabouts on Wednesday. At Tuesdays hearing, Zhaos lawyers said he would remain in the Seattle area through Monday evening, and would be able to then return to the UAE, provided the district judge did not object to his agreement with the government, another DOJ spokesperson said. Later on Wednesday, federal prosecutors urged a federal judge to block Zhao from leaving the continental United States prior to his February sentencing, saying in a court filing that Zhao posed a serious flight risk despite his bail conditions. There is no combination of conditions sufficient to protect against the risk of flight and ensure Zhaos return for sentencing, the prosecutors said. Some legal experts said they did not expect Zhao to spend more than a year in prison, maybe less, citing Arthur Hayes, former chief of crypto exchange BitMEX, who likewise pleaded guilty to anti-money laundering violations. Hayes was ultimately sentenced to six months of house arrest in 2022, even though the government sought prison time. Other senior BitMEX executives charged did not serve time. However, FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried could spend decades in prison after being found guilty this month of defrauding customers of his now-bankrupt crypto exchange. Based on the alleged facts, prosecutors likely could have charged Zhao with more serious crimes carrying heavier sentences, but had to weigh that against the probability that he would have stayed abroad to avoid capture, legal experts said. To get the CEO to plead guilty should not be scoffed at, said Daniel Silva, a partner at law firm Buchalter and former federal prosecutor. The settlement also bars Zhao from any present or future involvement in operating or managing Binance, which he founded in 2017 and has maintained a tight grip on since. He remains a major shareholder and said on Tuesday he will be available to the team to consult as needed, consistent with the deal. This could give him a hook on which to exercise control  through the usual corporate governance channels (e.g., shareholder voting, Yesha Yadav, a law professor at Vanderbilt University, wrote in an email to Reuters. At the same time, I imagine that the Binance will be looking to be very careful. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "title": "WHO asks China for more data on outbreak of respiratory illnesses in north",
        "date": "November 23, 2023 01:52 pm",
        "content": "Northern China has reported an increase in influenza-like illness since mid-October when compared to the same period in the previous three years, the WHO said. WHO has made an official request to China for detailed information on an increase in respiratory illnesses and reported clusters of pneumonia in children, the UN health body said in a statement on Wednesday. Chinas National Health Commission told reporters last week that the respiratory illness spike was due to the lifting of Covid-19 restrictions and the circulation of known pathogens, namely influenza and common bacterial infections that affect children, including mycoplasma pneumonia. The Chinese capital of Beijing, located in the north of the country, is currently experiencing a cold snap, with temperatures expected to plummet to well below zero by Friday, state media said. Temperatures plummeted as the city entered a high incidence season of respiratory infectious diseases, Wang Quanyi, deputy director and chief epidemiological expert at the Beijing Center for Disease Control and Prevention, told state media on Wednesday. Beijing is currently showing a trend of multiple pathogens coexisting, he added. Due to the season At Beijings Capital Institute of Pediatrics Childrens Hospital on Thursday, AFP journalists saw crowds of parents and children dressed in winter clothes. A parent surnamed Zhang accompanied her coughing nine-year-old son and said he had fallen ill with pneumonia. There are really a lot of children who have caught it recently, she said. Li Meiling, 42, had brought her eight-year-old daughter, who was suffering from mycoplasma pneumonia -- a pathogen that can cause sore throats, fatigue and fever. Its true that a lot of children her age are ill with this at the moment, she told AFP. But she said she was not particularly worried about the WHO announcement. Its winter, so its normal that there are more cases of respiratory illnesses. Its due to the season. On November 21, media and public disease surveillance system ProMED reported clusters of undiagnosed pneumonia in children in northern China. The WHO said it was unclear if ProMEDs report was related to the authorities press conference and that it was seeking clarification. The agency has also requested additional information on recent trends in the circulation of known pathogens, including influenza, SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that gives rise to Covid-19), RSV affecting infants and Mycoplasma pneumoniae, as well as on the degree of overcrowding in the health system, the statement added. In the meantime, it urged people to take preventative measures, including getting vaccinated, keeping distance from sick people and wearing masks. The WHO gave no indication of Chinas response to the request for more information. And Chinas foreign ministry did not respond to a request for comment from AFP on Thursday. Calls for transparency Over the course of the Covid-19 pandemic, the WHO repeatedly criticised Chinese authorities for their lack of transparency and cooperation. More than three years after cases were first detected in Wuhan, heated debate still rages around the origins of Covid-19. Scientists are divided between two main theories of the cause: an escape from a laboratory in the city where such viruses were being studied and an intermediate animal that infected people at a local market. Earlier this year, WHO experts said they were sure that Beijing had far more data that could shed light on the origins of Covid, and called it a moral imperative for the information to be shared. A team of specialists led by the WHO and accompanied by Chinese colleagues investigated China in early 2021, but there has not been a team able to return since and WHO officials have repeatedly asked for additional data. WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has stressed that getting to the bottom of the mystery could help avert future pandemics. Source - France24 - Agencies",

        "date": "November 23, 2023 04:04 pm",
        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe says there was no evidence indicating that the Chinese research vessels that had docked in Sri Lanka were spy ships. We asked for evidence, and there was none. These were civilian ships. In an exclusive interview with the Indian news agency Firstpost, the Sri Lankan leader said the island nation would not allow spy ships to make port calls here. Responding to a question on the arrival of two Chinese research vessels in Sri Lanka amidst the concerns raised by India and the United States, Wickremesinghe emphasized that Sri Lanka always welcomes both research and military vessels, not only from China but also from other countries as well. He pointed out that only the arrivals of Chinese vessels make headlines, despite Sri Lanka often allowing the entry of vessels from other countries as well. When asked if he thinks Sri Lanka is caught in the great power battle between China and India, Wickremesinghe assured that the island nation would not do anything that would compromise the national security of its neighbour. Commenting on the progress of the debt restructuring process, the President said China, despite being the biggest bilateral creditor, opted to negotiate with Sri Lanka separately because it was not satisfied with the terms of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank. They feel that they should have a bigger role to play in the IMF. So they decided to opt out of it. It is making life more difficult for all of us who are in debt. He mentioned that it was not easy to negotiate the terms of Sri Lankas debt restructuring in international geopolitics. In response to a question about Indias efforts to bring all creditors of Sri Lanka to one platform and Chinas refusal to join it, Wickremesinghe said dealing with two groups for debt restructuring was not easy, adding that the outcome would nonetheless be the same. On October 11, the Sri Lankan government said it had reached an agreement on the key principles and indicative terms of a debt treatment with the Export-Import (Exim) Bank of China, noting that the agreement in principle covers approximately USD 4.2 billion of outstanding debt. Wickremesinghe told Firstpost that the terms of the Colombo-Beijing debt deal have been shared with other creditors. When asked about the countrys economic recovery, the President said Sri Lanka got through although the past year has been challenging. We are not out of the woods yet but will come out. He said Sri Lanka still has to balance the budget and trade and increase its revenues. He expressed hopes that things would get better in 2024-2025. Wickremesinghe is confident that there would not be any problems in unlocking the remainder of the IMFs bailout package as Sri Lanka has fulfilled the global lenders benchmarks. Responding to a question on the upcoming presidential election, which he earlier said would definitely be held in 2024, Wickremesinghe said his priority is to get the economy in shape. Thereafter, I can decide what I want to do.",

        "content": "Thailand and Sri Lanka plan to conclude negotiations for a bilateral free trade agreement (FTA) by the end of this year, with the pact scheduled for signature in early February 2024, says the chief of trade negotiations of Thailand. Chotima lemsawasdikul, director-general of the Thailands Trade Negotiations Department, said Thai and Sri Lankan officials are slated to meet Nov 27-29 this year for the eighth round of FTA talks, with Thailand hosting the discussions, the Bangkok Post reported. The negotiations aim to reach a substantial conclusion, with another round of talks in December hosted by Sri Lanka, she said. Ms Chotima said a final round of negotiations hosted by Sri Lanka is slated for January, aligning with the goal set earlier for a FTA signing on Feb 3, 2024, coinciding with the anniversary of Sri Lankas independence. The FTA signing is likely to take place in Sri Lanka, she said. Despite Sri Lankas relatively small size and population of only 22 million, studies by the department found the country holds an important geographic position in the Indian Ocean, making it a hub for maritime transport, the report said. The island also possesses an abundance of natural resources, such as precious minerals and seafood. A Thailand-Sri Lanka FTA is projected to expand Thailands economy by 0.02, equivalent to US80 million. This includes the expansion of investments and the value of Thai exports to Sri Lanka, the Bangkok Post reports. Products that could benefit from the pact include automobiles and auto components, machinery, electrical appliances, metals, sugar and plastics, according to the department. Industries in which Thailand could expand its investments in Sri Lanka include processed foods, beverages, textiles, garments and jewellery. Two-way trade between Thailand and Sri Lanka amounted to 358 million in 2022, down 16.5 from 2021. Thailand exported goods worth 271 million to Sri Lanka and imported goods valued at 86.9 million. In the first nine months of this year, two-way trade between Thailand and Sri Lanka tallied 285 million, up 1.79 year-on-year, with exports from Thailand worth roughly 188 million, a decrease of 12.4, according to the Bangkok Post. Sri Lanka and Thailand first considered establishing an FTA in 2016 when Somkid Jatusripitak, then deputy prime minister of Thailand, made an official visit to the island nation. The countries signed a memorandum of understanding on technical cooperation, a letter of intent on cooperation in the area of small and medium-sized enterprise development, and a joint programme on tourism for the period 2016-18. The Thai cabinet approved the negotiation framework for the PTA talks with Sri Lanka on May 8, 2018. The framework covers trade in goods, services, investment and comprehensive economic cooperation.

        "title": "OpenAI board that fired Sam Altman sacked",
        "date": "November 23, 2023 06:08 pm",
        "content": "Sam Altmans shock return as chief executive of OpenAI late Tuesday -- days after being sacked -- caps a chaotic period that highlighted deep tensions at the heart of the Artificial Intelligence community. The board that fired Altman from his role as CEO of the ChatGPT creator has been almost entirely replaced following a rebellion by employees, cementing his position at the helm of the firm. The sole survivor in the boardroom in the new Altman era is Adam DAngelo, the CEO of question-and-answer site Quora. He will be joined by ex-Salesforce co-CEO Bret Taylor and by former US Treasury Secretary and president of Harvard University, Larry Summers. In Summers, Altman will find a seasoned economist and well-known figure in Washington, who has spoken of both the dangers and opportunities of ChatGPT for the cognitive classes. ChatGPT is gonna replace what doctors do, hearing symptoms and making diagnoses, before it changes what nurses do, Summers told Bloomberg News earlier this year. Neither Altman nor OpenAI co-founder Greg Brockman -- who quit as company president following Altmans sacking -- will return to the board, which could soon have as many as six additional members, the Wall Street Journal reported. I love openai, and everything ive done over the past few days has been in service of keeping this team and its mission together, Altman wrote in a social media post late Tuesday on X, formerly Twitter. - Disputes over departure - The five-day saga began on Friday, when Altman was abruptly sacked by the board for reasons that are still unclear. The board said in a statement that it had sacked Altman because he was not consistently candid in his communications with the board, without elaborating further. It strongly resisted attempts to bring him back, cycling through two new chief executives over the weekend, before three of its four remaining members were sacked on Tuesday to pave the way for Altmans dramatic return. Some media outlets reported that there had been concerns that OpenAI was moving quickly away from its stated mission of building safe and beneficial artificial general intelligence for the benefit of humanity, for commercial gain. However, OpenAIs interim CEO Emmett Shear, said in a social media post that he had been assured The board did not remove Sam over any specific disagreement on safety, without elaborating on why Altman had been sacked. - Fears over AI governance - Altmans return reaffirms his position as a leader in the rapidly-evolving field of generative-AI. But the agreement also highlights the growing power that Microsoft now wields over the future of OpenAI. During his five days in the wilderness, Altman briefly took up a position at the tech giant, which has poured billions of dollars into OpenAI and helped launch ChatGPT, whose success sparked a multi-billion-dollar global race in AI research and development. In an X post confirming his return, Altman cited satyas support, in his decision to return to OpenAI, a reference to Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella. Im looking forward to returning to openai, and building on our strong partnership with msft, Altman added, an apparent reference to Microsoft. While OpenAIs ChatGPT is the most widely known large language model -- or LLM -- many of the other big tech firms, including Google and Facebook parent Meta, have invested heavily in the powerful AI technology -- raising concerns about its governance. Earlier this month, Western governments and tech companies agreed to a new safety testing regime to allay concerns at the pace at which AI is growing, and at the lack of global safeguards in place to control it. The UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres told the conference in London that the world was playing catch-up in efforts to regulate AI, which had possible long-term negative consequences on everything from jobs to culture.

        "date": "November 23, 2023 10:04 pm",
        "content": "In a significant and forward-looking speech at the 25th Presidential Awards of the Export Development Board (EDB), held today at the Bandaranaike Memorial International Conference Hall (BMICH), President Ranil Wickremesinghe outlined a comprehensive plan to revitalize Sri Lankas agricultural sector for export, acknowledging past challenges and missed opportunities. The President also underscored the importance of modernizing agricultural practices and enhancing research capabilities. He revealed plans to restructure and modernize existing agricultural research institutes, culminating in the establishment of the Agro-Technology University of Sri Lanka. This institution aims to support extension services and further innovation in the sector. Reflecting on historical setbacks in the agricultural sector due to land reforms in 1972, President Wickremesinghe emphasized their adverse impact on agricultural exports. The President cited missed opportunities to focus on exports during key periods, such as the 60s, early 70s and post-war periods, attributing these lapses to internal conflicts and policy choices. The President expressed regret for not capitalizing on the countrys inherent strengths in agriculture, which other successful nations like Singapore had recognized. Acknowledging the past neglect of agriculture due to various constraints, he emphasized the need to reposition the sector as a key player in the nations export strategy. The President outlined a multi-pronged approach to agricultural development, targeting both small and large-scale farmers. He stressed the importance of providing financial support for smallholders to embrace agro-technology, aiming to enhance productivity. Additionally, plans were revealed to grant freehold status to individuals holding land development permits, fostering a sense of ownership and incentivizing further development. In a bid to create opportunities for large-scale agriculture, President Wickremesinghe announced the allocation of previously undeveloped areas, including portions of the Mahaweli scheme and lands owned by government plantation corporations, for agricultural purposes. This strategic move is expected to bring approximately 300,000 acres of land under cultivation within the next few years, requiring significant capital investment. To ensure the success of these initiatives, President Wickremesinghe emphasized the need for extension services, collaboration with the private sector and the establishment of an agro-technology university. He outlined plans to review the performance of regional plantation companies and shift towards contract farming in the tea and rubber sectors. Turning to broader economic challenges, President Wickremesinghe acknowledged the countrys lack of growth and opportunities over the past two years. He attributed these issues to a historical imbalance in the trade and emphasized the critical need to address the budget deficit and balance of trade and highlighted the urgency of increasing exports. The President elaborated on measures to improve the countrys fiscal situation and the availability of funds for small and medium industries affected by the economic crisis. In a global context, President Wickremesinghe acknowledged the challenges posed by international competitors such as China, Vietnam, Thailand and Malaysia in the export-oriented industries. Despite this, he stressed the urgency of the current export drive, emphasizing the need to secure the countrys future and prevent further brain drain. The President highlighted the importance of attracting investments, both foreign and domestic, to drive innovation and expand export markets. He announced financial support for small and medium industries, underlining the governments commitment to preserving and strengthening the supply chain. President Wickremesinghe reiterated Sri Lankas historical strength as an exporter of agricultural goods. He urged a return to these roots, emphasizing the potential for value-added exports in tea, rubber and coconut. The President encouraged stakeholders to explore new areas of exports, inviting investments and partnerships to ensure the sustained growth of the countrys export-driven economy. Concluding his address, President Ranil Wickremesinghe positioned the revival of Sri Lankas agricultural exports as a requirement for the nations economic turnaround. By combining support for smallholders, large-scale agricultural initiatives and strategic planning for export diversification, the President set forth a comprehensive vision aimed at harnessing Sri Lankas rich agricultural legacy for a prosperous future. The ambitious plans outlined by President Ranil Wickremesinghe signal a pivotal moment for Sri Lankas agricultural sector, offering a roadmap for economic revitalization and a renewed focus on export-driven growth. President Ranil Wickremesinghe conferred the Presidential Awards to recognize the exceptional contributions of Sri Lankan exporters to the export sector and overall economic advancement. In addition to the awards ceremony, President Ranil Wickremesinghe presided over the launch of the Sri Lanka Export Brand, the online application https:pea.edb.gov.lk dedicated to Presidential Export Awards.

        "date": "November 23, 2023 10:33 pm",
        "content": "Minister of Labour and Foreign Employment, Manusha Nanayakkara, has revealed that the Ministry has received over 10,000 applications to work on Israeli farms. Supermarket manager Laknath Dias says the economic crisis in his native Sri Lanka is too much for him to bear. He is getting ready to fly to Israel in December to work as a farmhand for nearly 10 times the pay, despite the war with Hamas. Dias is among 20,000 workers that Sri Lanka, desperate for dollars and remittances, plans to send to Israel starting early next month to work in the farm and construction sectors, a Sri Lankan minister told Reuters on Thursday. Israels farms, most of which are in the centre and south of the country, traditionally rely on thousands of Thai and Palestinian workers to till the land and bring in the crops. But many Thais fled Israel after the Hamas assault on Oct. 7, while the Palestinians have largely been banned from the workforce, forcing farms to send out an SOS for workers during the harvest. Dias, 39, said he has experience living through conflict. We lived during a war in Sri Lanka, he said, referring to Sri Lankas civil war against Tamil separatists between 1983 and 2009. I have worked in Colombo where there were suicide bombs going off at one point and even in conflict areas in the east around 2005. So I think we can manage. We are familiar with working on a farm so Im confident we can face anything. He says his monthly salary of 72,000 rupees (219) is not enough to sustain his family of five because of the high cost of living. Dias expects to make about 700,000 rupees as a farmhand in Israel, where he plans to work for five years. Sri Lankas labour and foreign employment minister, Manusha Nanayakkara, said they had received more than 10,000 applications to work on Israeli farms and workers security would be considered. We are also looking at sending another 10,000 workers for the construction sector next. Israel launched its war in Gaza after gunmen from Hamas burst across the border fence, killing 1,200 people and seizing about 240 hostages, according to Israeli tallies. Since then, more than 14,000 Gazans have been killed by Israeli bombardment, according to health authorities in the Hamas-ruled territory. The Sri Lankan workers will join some 9,000 compatriots already in Israel, working in farming and care for the elderly. Sri Lanka, an island of 22 million, saw its economy contract 7.8 last year during the countrys worst economic crisis in more than seven decades, pushing 2.5 million people into poverty, according to the World Bank. It has seen a steep increase in the number of people migrating since the crisis, with about 312,000 leaving in 2022 and 268,000 this year, government data shows. They have gone to countries including Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Britain, Canada and New Zealand. Source - Hindustan Times - Agencies",

        "content": "The 18th meeting of the Committee on Ways and Means was held in Parliament on Wednesday (22 Nov.) under the Chairmanship of Patali Champika Ranawaka. The discussion held was in connection with the implementation of the appeal process of the Aswasuma benefit program and obtaining the Grama Niladhari officials for the implementation of its second phase. Representative officials of the Welfare Benefit Board, Director Generals of Institutions and Grama Niladhari officials Trade Unions, Sri Lanka United Grama Niladhari officials Association, All Ceylon Independent Grama Niladhari officials Association, Graduate Grama Niladhari officials Association, Government Grama Niladhari officials Association, Sri Lanka Administrative Grama Niladhari officials Association, All Ceylon Administrative Grama Niladhari officials Association, Sri Lanka United Grama Niladhari officials Association were called before this Committee meeting held.

        "title": "Central Bank further relaxes its monetary policy stance",
        "date": "November 24, 2023 07:57 am",
        "content": "The Monetary Policy Board of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) has decided to further reduce the Standing Deposit Facility Rate (SDFR) and the Standing Lending Facility Rate (SLFR) of the Central Bank by 100 basis points (bps) to 9.00 and 10.00, respectively. At its meeting on Thursday (Nov.23), the Board arrived at this decision following a careful analysis of the current and expected developments in the domestic and global economy, with the aim of achieving and maintaining inflation at the targeted level of 5 over the medium term, while enabling the economy to reach and stabilise at the potential level. The Board took note of possible upside risks to inflation projections in the near term due to supply-side factors stemming from the expected developments domestically and globally. However, the Board viewed that such near-term risks would not materially change the medium-term inflation outlook, as inflation expectations of the public remain anchored and economic activity is projected to remain below par in the near to medium term. Further, the Board viewed that with this reduction of policy interest rates, along with the monetary policy measures carried out since June 2023, sufficient monetary easing has been effected in order to stabilise inflation over the medium term. Hence, the Board underscored the need for a swift and full pass-through of monetary easing measures to market interest rates, particularly lending rates, by the financial institutions, thereby accelerating the normalisation of market interest rates in the period ahead. In its press release, the CBSL mentioned that headline inflation continues to remain low, reflecting subdued demand conditions. Headline inflation, as measured by the year-on-year change in the Colombo Consumer Price Index (CCPI, 2021100), was recorded at 1.5 in October 2023, as opposed to 1.3 in September 2023. Food inflation continued to be negative (year-on-year) for the fourth consecutive month in October 2023. Meanwhile, the National Consumer Price Index (NCPI, 2021100)-based headline inflation (year-on-year) was recorded at 1.0 in October 2023, compared to 0.8 in September 2023. Both CCPI and NCPI based core inflation (year-on-year), which reflects underlying demand pressures in the economy, moderated further in October 2023, reflecting the subdued demand pressures in the economy. A one-off upward movement in inflation is expected in the near term, driven mainly by the changes to the Value Added Tax (VAT) proposed by the government effective January 2024. The spillover effects of tax measures and other developments are likely to be muted due to subdued underlying demand pressures; hence, this rise in inflation is expected to be transitory. Accordingly, headline inflation over the medium term is expected to converge towards the targeted level of 5, supported by appropriate policy measures. The CBSL said market interest rates are expected to normalise in the period ahead. Market interest rates continued to adjust downwards, and most benchmark interest rates have declined significantly. Meanwhile, the yields on government securities are also adjusting downwards with falling risk premia. The reduction of policy interest rates by 100 bps in this monetary policy review is expected to create further space for market interest rates to adjust downward and normalise in the period ahead. Reflecting the transmission of the relaxed monetary policy stance, outstanding credit to the private sector by the banking sector expanded on a monthly basis in September as well as in October 2023 based on provisional data. With the moderation of market lending interest rates, credit to the private sector is expected to increase further in the period ahead, thereby supporting the envisaged rebound of domestic economic activity.",

The top-order T20 batter was arrested and charged with four counts of sexual assault in November 2022 after the woman reported the matter to Bondi police. The court was told the woman had told Mr Gunathilaka that she would only agree to sex if he wore a condom, which he grumbled about but ultimately agreed to. Notes from the womans first police interview indicate she told officers the condom was taken off against her will, allegations Mr Gunathilaka denied. During that interview, Justice Huggett said the woman failed to include critical evidence she later provided to police in a statement some six months later. Ultimately, police only proceeded to trial on a single charge, that of stealthing, with charges relating to the roughness of the sex being dropped. The deficiencies in the prosecution case of stealthing, remembering that the prosecution case was not one of rough or aggressive sexual intercourse, were apparent, Justice Huggett said. They were not the result of the factual findings made at trial  Nor were the deficiencies related simply to the credibility of the complainant (the woman). There were so many inherent issues and difficulties with the prosecution case that should have been obvious to the prosecution at the outset. Justice Huggett ordered that a certificate be issued to Mr Gunathilaka so that he may be awarded costs. Its understood he has since returned home. Police had submitted that in deciding to prosecute Mr Gunathilaka they could not have predicted what factual findings would be made at trial. Source: The Australian",

        "content": "The Colombo District Court today (Nov.24) dismissed a petition filed by State Minister Diana Gamage, seeking an interim injunction against Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa and Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) general secretary Ranjith Madduma Bandara. In her petition, Gamage had sought an interim order preventing Sajith Premadasa from functioning as the SJBs leader and Ranjith Madduma Bandara as the partys general secretary, alleging that the two politicians are not suitable to hold their respective positions in the main opposition. The petitioner had pointed out that, pursuant to the SJBs constitution, a member of another political party cannot hold membership in the SJB. She said there are pending court cases filed by Sajith Premadasa and Ranjith Madduma Bandara with regard to their membership in the United National Party (UNP). As such, Gamage has sought an interim order ruling that it is unlawful for the duo to hold their respective positions in the SJB as they are still members of the UNP. During todays proceedings, Colombo District Judge Sandun Withana ordered the petitioner and the respondents to submit their responses on February 12, 2024. After taking into consideration the submissions presented today, the judge determined that the petitioner has refrained from disclosing certain details in her complaint. Accordingly, the judge refused to deliver an interim injunction against the SJB leader and general secretary.",

Accordingly, the case is now fixed to be taken up for further consideration before the Appeals Court on November 27, making this the fourth consecutive time the matter was deferred. The petition, filed by SLC President Shammi Silva, was called before the Appeals Court bench comprising Justices Sobhitha Rajakaruna and D.N. Samarakoon this morning. This judge bench was named by Appeals Court president, Justice Nissanka Bandula Karunaratne after the previous bench recused themselves. Thus far, three Judges, including Justice Neil Iddawela, have withdrawn themselves from the consideration of the petition. On November 06, a seven-member Interim Committee was appointed by Sports Minister Roshan Ranasinghe, chaired by World Cup-winning former Sri Lanka captain Arjuna Ranatunga. It consisted of S. I. Imam, Retired Supreme Court Judge; Rohini Marasinghe, Retired Supreme Court Judge; Irangani Perera, Retired High Court Judge; Arjuna Ranatunga (Chairman); Upali Dharmadasa; Rakitha Rajapakshe, Attorney-at-Law; and Hisham Jamaldeen. The following day, the Appeals Court issued a 14-day stay order on the Interim Committee. The relevant order was issued by a two-member judge bench consisting of Appeals Court President Nissanka Bandula Karunaratne and Justice Vikum Kaluarachchi, upon consideration of the writ application filed by the SLC President challenging the Sports Ministers move. Later, on November 13, Minister Ranasinghe filed a motion requesting the lifting of the stay order.",

        "title": "Israel-Hamas war: Four-day truce begins, setting stage for release of dozens of hostages",
        "date": "November 24, 2023 11:42 am",
        "content": "A four-day truce in the Israel-Hamas war took effect early Friday, setting the stage for the exchange of dozens of hostages held by militants in Gaza in return for Palestinians imprisoned by Israel. The halt in fighting promised some relief for Gazas 2.3 million people, who have endured weeks of Israeli bombardment, as well as families in Israel fearful for the fate of loved ones taken captive during Hamas Oct. 7 attack that triggered the war. The cease-fire kicked off at 7 a.m. local time (0500 GMT) and is to last at least four days. During this period, Gazas ruling Hamas group pledged to free at least 50 of the about 240 hostages it and other militants took on Oct. 7. Hamas said Israel would free 150 Palestinian prisoners. Both sides will release women and children first. Israel said the truce would be extended an extra day for every additional 10 hostages freed. The truce-for-hostages deal was reached in weeks of intense indirect negotiations, with Qatar, the United States and Egypt serving as mediators. If it holds, it would mark the first significant break in fighting since Israel declared war on Hamas seven weeks ago. The agreement raised hopes of eventually winding down the war, which has leveled vast swaths of Gaza, fueled a surge of violence in the occupied West Bank and stirred fears of a wider conflagration across the Middle East. Israel has pushed back against such speculation, saying it was determined to resume its massive offensive once the truce ends. A first group of 13 women and children held by Hamas will be freed Friday afternoon, according to Majed al-Ansari, the spokesman of the Qatari foreign ministry. Three Palestinian prisoners, also women and minors, are to be released for every freed hostage. Israels Justice Ministry published a list of 300 prisoners eligible to be released, mainly teenagers detained over the past year for rock-throwing and other minor offenses. The return of hostages could lift spirits in Israel, where their plight has gripped the country. Families of the hostages have staged mass demonstrations to pressure the government to bring them home. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahus office said it notified the families of hostages listed for release Friday. Increased aid for Palestinians will start to enter Gaza as soon as possible, al-Ansari said Thursday. The hope is that the momentum from this deal will lead to an end to this violence, he told reporters. Hamas said 200 trucks a day will enter Gaza carrying aid. Qatar said the aid will include fuel, but has given no details on quantities. Israel cut off all imports at the start of the war, except for a trickle of food, water and medical supplies allowed in from Egypt. The lack of fuel has caused a territory-wide blackout, leaving homes and hospitals reliant on faltering generators. Separately, the Israeli military dropped leaflets over southern Gaza, warning hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians who sought refuge there not to try to return to their homes in the northern half of the territory, the focus of Israels ground offensive. Israel has said it would block attempts to return. The war erupted when several thousand Hamas militants stormed into southern Israel, killing at least 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking scores of hostages, including babies, women and older adults, as well as soldiers. Hamas is expected to demand a large number of high-profile prisoners in return for soldiers. The Israeli bombardment, now in its seventh week, has killed more than 13,300 Palestinians, according to the Health Ministry in Hamas-ruled Gaza, which resumed its detailed count of casualties in Gaza from the war. The ministry had stopped publishing casualty counts since Nov. 11, saying it had lost the ability to do so because of the health systems collapse in the north. The new numbers were not fully broken down, but women and minors have consistently made up around two-thirds of the dead. The figures do not include updated numbers from hospitals in the north. The ministry says some 6,000 people have been reported missing, feared buried under rubble. The ministry does not differentiate between civilians and militants in its death tolls. Israel says it has killed thousands of Hamas fighters, without presenting evidence for its count. Israeli airstrikes continued in the final hours ahead of the truce. On Thursday afternoon, a strike leveled a residential building in the Nuseirat refugee camp in central Gaza. At least 12 people were killed, according to officials at nearby Al-Aqsa Hospital. One resident, Hosni Moharib, said his wife and several children were killed and other relatives remained buried under the rubble. It exploded on the house, striking the babies and young children. Everyone in the house, they are all dead, he said, bursting into tears. Netanyahu vowed to continue the war after the truce expires to destroy Hamas military capabilities, end its 16-year rule in Gaza and return all the estimated 240 captives held in Gaza by Hamas and other groups. We will continue it until we achieve all our goals, Netanyahu said, adding that he had delivered the same message in a phone call to U.S. President Joe Biden. Washington has provided extensive military and diplomatic support to Israel since the start of the war. Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant was quoted as telling troops Thursday that their respite will be short and that the war would resume with intensity for at least two more months. In Gazas city of Khan Younis, Palestinians welcomed the respite of the upcoming cease-fire but said four days would do little to relieve the humanitarian disaster caused by the war. God willing, it becomes a total cease-fire, said Jihan Qanan. People have had houses brought down on their heads, theyve been expelled ... Theres no homes, no money, no possessions. The whole world is wrecked. Source - AP News - Agencies",

        "content": "Hamas fighters released 24 hostages on Nov 24, during the first day of the wars first truce, including Israeli women and children and Thai farm workers, after guns fell silent across the Gaza Strip for the first time in seven weeks. The hostages were transferred out of Gaza and handed over to Egyptian authorities at the Rafah border crossing, accompanied by eight staff members of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) in a four-car convoy, the ICRC said. Qatar, which acted as mediator for the truce deal, said 13 Israelis had been released, some with dual nationalities, plus 10 Thais and a Filipino. Thirty-nine Palestinian women and children were released from Israeli jails in return for the 13 Israelis, Qatar said. The deep pain that family members separated from their loved ones feel is indescribable. We are relieved that some will be reunited after long agony, said Mr Fabrizio Carboni, the ICRCs regional director for the Near and Middle East. Israel released the names of the Israeli hostages, who included four children accompanied by four family members, and five other elderly women. The released hostages underwent an initial medical assessment inside Israeli territory. They will continue to be accompanied by IDF soldiers as they make their way to Israeli hospitals, where they will be reunited with their families, the military said. Doctors would perform a full physical examination of every hostage, and they would be able to video-call family members in a conversation monitored by professionals, said Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant earlier. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a recorded video message: We have just completed the return of the first batch of our hostages. Children, their mothers and other women. Each and every one of them is a world in itself. But I stress to you, the families, and to you, citizens of Israel: We are committed to returning all our hostages. Under the terms of the four-day Israel-Hamas truce, 50 women and children hostages are to be released over four days, in return for 150 Palestinian women and children among thousands of detainees in Israeli jails. Israel says the truce could be extended if more hostages are released at a rate of 10 per day. The first 13 released on Nov 24 were to be exchanged for 24 Palestinian women and 15 teenagers. A source briefed on the negotiations said the release of the Thai workers, who were all men, was unrelated to the truce negotiations and followed a separate track of talks with Hamas mediated by Egypt and Qatar. Thai and Filipino farmworkers employed in southern Israel were among around 240 hostages dragged back to Gaza by gunmen when Hamas fighters launched a killing spree on Oct 7. Thai Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin said in a social media post that 12 Thai workers had been freed, two more than the figure given by the Qataris. No reason for the discrepancy was given. The authorities in Tel Aviv are now gearing up for the complex task of helping those returning home from a nearly seven-week hostage ordeal that may have left them deeply traumatised. Hamas militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct 7, killing about 1,200 people, most of them civilians, according to an Israeli count, and seizing about 240 hostages. Israel has vowed to crush Hamas in response and unleashed a withering military campaign that Gazas Hamas government says has killed nearly 15,000 people in the coastal territory. We hope the picture will be beautiful at the end of the day, Mr Ziv Agmon, legal adviser to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, told reporters, saying Israel would follow the agreement but could not speak for Hamas. With a terrorist organisation like Hamas, everything that happens in the coming days is a miracle, he said. Journalists saw Israeli tanks moving away from Gaza at the northern end as the truce began at 7am (1pm in Singapore) on Nov 24, and aid trucks rolling in from Egypt at the southern end. There was no sound of Israeli air force activity above northern Gaza, nor any of the contrails typically left by Palestinian rocket fire. Hamas confirmed on its Telegram channel that all hostilities from its forces would cease. But the groups spokesman Abu Ubaida for Hamas armed wing later referred to this temporary truce in a video message that called for an escalation of the confrontation with (Israel) on all resistance fronts, including the Israeli-occupied West Bank, where violence has surged since the Gaza war erupted almost seven weeks ago. The Israeli military also said fighting would resume soon. This will be a short pause, at the conclusion of which the war (and) fighting will continue with great might and will generate pressure for the return of more hostages, Israeli Defence Minister Mr Gallant said. Life has changed dramatically This is very important... because we dont know what they know. Many have family members who are not alive anymore. There are children with parents that were murdered, siblings who were also murdered, said Mr Agmon, the adviser to Mr Netanyahu. The released hostages would then be flown to five major hospitals and medical facilities around Israel, where they would be physically reunited with their loved ones. Experts said it was crucial that they be slowly and gently reintroduced to reality. The biggest risk is to usher them into their previous life without doing it slowly and gently because its overwhelming and some of them will shut down completely, Dr Rony Berger, a senior clinical psychologist and expert on coping with the trauma of a terror attack or major disaster. The first thing was to protect them from the carnival of their homecoming, he said. They were probably isolated so bringing them into all this stimulation is very hard, he said, explaining they would be taken to a secluded place with very few family members. Life has changed dramatically. It will take time for them to reconnect to their life before, he said, adding that many would also learn that one or both parents had been killed, or other close relatives. Obviously, you dont tell a three-year-old in the same way (as an older child) but they may ask and you have to tell them something. And if hes six years old, you have to tell him. So mourning will be part of that, he said. Fighting raged on in the hours leading up to the truce, with officials inside Gaza saying a hospital was among the targets bombed. The Indonesian Hospital was reeling under relentless bombing, operating without light and filled with bedridden old people and children too weak to be moved, Gaza health officials said. Al-Jazeera quoted Director Mounir El Barsh of the Gaza Health Ministry as saying a patient  a wounded woman  was killed, and three others injured. With the truce holding on so far, aid is again flowing to Gaza. Hamas-affiliated Shehab news agency reported that fuel trucks were entering the Rafah crossing once the truce was under way. By mid-morning, 60 trucks carrying aid had crossed from Egypt at the Rafah border point. Two of the first trucks to enter sported banners that said: Together for Humanity. Another said: For our brothers in Gaza. Egypt said 130,000 litres of diesel and four trucks of gas will be delivered daily to Gaza when the truce starts, and that 200 trucks of aid will enter Gaza daily. Source: AFPReuters -Agencies",

        "content": "The Sri Lankan government and the European Union (EU) have signed a financing agreement to promote a circular economy and sustainable consumption and production in the food sector. The grant of EUR 15 million from the EU aims to increase food availability for vulnerable people through more efficient distribution channelsmechanisms of food, avoiding food waste andor convert food waste into much needed farming inputs like organic fertilizer, animal feed, etc. Sri Lanka face numerous challenges, from resource scarcity to effective protection of environmental and other resources. Within these challenges, however, lies an opportunity to adopt a circular economy model that can transform the development of new technologies, business models, and entrepreneurship and innovation, that foster a thriving economy, said Moreno Carmen, Ambassador of the European Union to Sri Lanka and the Maldives. Promoting circular economy practices is vital for the country to mitigate the risk of crises in the future and to establish food security and sustainability. The European Union is pleased to support Sri Lankas improve the food surpluswaste recovery system and food producers, Carmen said further. The EU grant Promoting a Circular Economy in the Food Sector amounts to EUR 15 million. Following the signature of the agreement, the EU will proceed to contract implementing partners for the delivery of the support. The action is aligned with the Paris Agreement, the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and more particularly the external dimension of EU policies under the EU Green Deal and more directly to SDG 12 on responsible consumption and production. It will also contribute to Sri Lankas commitments under the 2021 updated National Determined Contributions (NDCs) and the implementation of the National Policy on Sustainable Consumption and Production.

        "date": "November 24, 2023 11:51 pm",
        "content": "Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) has issued a clarification about composition of the composition of the national squad that took part in the 2023 ICC Mens Cricket World Cup held in India. In its statement, the islands cricket governing body said Sports Ministry did not approve the names of Wanindu Hasaranga and Dushmantha Chameera, despite the SLCs intention to send the duo the World Cup. The SLC also mentioned that it had plans to get Hasaranga and Chameera to play at some point in the tournament after they recover from injuries, but to no avail, as the Sports Ministry did not give its nod to send the two players without medical clearance. Sri Lanka Cricket wishes to reiterate that Wanindu Hasaranga and Dushmantha Chameera were included in the 15-member squad selected by the Sri Lanka Cricket Selectors to take part in the ICC Mens Cricket World Cup 2023. The national selection committee had selected the initial squad, which both Hasaranga and Chameera were part of, during a selection meeting held on September 05 at the SLC headquarters, the statement read further. This was done despite the fact that both players were still recovering from injuries. Following the selection meeting, on the same day, SLC said it sent the squad seeking approval of the National Sports Selection Committee, which comes under the Ministry of Sports  Youth Affairs. According to the cricket body, the Sports Ministry, in response, had sent a letter to SLC on September 26, seeking medical clearance to approve the inclusion of Wanindu Hasaranga, Dushmantha Chameera and Dilshan Madushanka. Finally, Sri Lanka Cricket, despite its intention to send Hasaranga and Chameera to the World Cup with the plan to play them at some point in the tournament after the duo recover from injuries, did not succeed, as the Sports Ministry did not approve the sending of the two players without medical clearance. (Letter sent to National Sports Selection Committee by SLC on September 5, 2023): (Letter sent by Sports Ministry, seeking medical clearance for Hasaranga and Chameera): In a separate statement, the SLC accused the Sports Ministry of misleading the public by providing confusing details as to how it spent the grant of Rs. 289 million provided by cricket governing body to the National Sports Fund. In a statement published on Friday (Nov.24), SLC emphasized that a comparison between a document it has obtained from the Sports Ministry under the Right to Information (RTI) Act and the media release issued by the ministry informing how the funds were spent, shows glaring differences. In the Sports Ministrys media release on November 13, it has provided details of 47 items on how the SLCs grant of Rs. 289 million had been spent, the statement read further. However, a document obtained by the SLC on November 23 under the Right to Information Act shows the ministry has spent money on 67 activities instead of the 47 mentioned in the media release. Meanwhile, an assessment between the Sports Ministrys media release and the document received by the SLC shows disparities in the figures of 33 items, the cricket body elaborated. On that account, SLC has earnestly requested the Sports Ministry to provide clarity on these differences, as transparency and accountability in such spending are vital ingredients of good governance.

        "title": "Israel releases 39 Palestinian prisoners in exchange for hostages",
        "date": "November 24, 2023 11:59 pm",
        "content": "A total of 39 Palestinian detainees have been released from Israeli prisons in exchange for a group of hostages held by Hamas. The deal - mediated by Qatar - includes a four-day pause in the fighting. They are accused of a range of offences, from throwing stones to attempted murder. Some were convicted while others were awaiting trial. The group of 24 women and 15 teenage boys was released across the Beituniya checkpoint in the occupied West Bank. They will then be allowed to return home, according to Israels prison service. The detainees were chosen from a list of 300 women and minors compiled by Israel. Less than a quarter of those on the list have been convicted - the vast majority are being held on remand while awaiting trial. Most of those listed are teenage boys - 40 of them under the age of 18. There is also one teenage girl and 32 women. Earlier, the road by Beituniya checkpoint, near Ramallah, was sharp with the smell of tear gas. Groups of Palestinian men and boys faced the Israeli army lining up on the road ahead. The army fired rubber bullets and tear gas towards the crowd, to push them back. Some of the young people gathered threw stones and tear gas canisters back towards the troops. Its a sign of hope for Palestinians and Israelis that the ceasefire will continue and the killing will stop, Mohammed Khatib, who was in the crowd, told the BBC. Upon the prisoners release, the bus that transported them inched its way through a sea of jubilant Palestinian supporters. Through the windows, some of the prisoners could be seen dancing, one wrapped in a Palestinian flag. Outside, mobile phones were raised to the glass amid ululations and shouts of welcome and God is great. A few in the crowd waved Hamas flags, but others spoke of Palestinian unity, a small moment of victory in the midst of a gruelling war. For Israel, the released prisoners are a security threat; for the Palestinians gathered here to greet them, they are victims of Israels occupation - and their release is a symbol. Thirteen Israeli hostages were released by Hamas under the truce deal. It was confirmed on Friday that they had arrived back in Israel. The Thai prime minister says that a group of Thai nationals held hostage by Hamas in Gaza were also released - separate from the Qatar-mediated truce deal. Israel and Hamas reached a deal earlier this week to release 50 of the hostages held in Gaza during four-day pause in fighting. The agreement should see a total of 150 Palestinians held in Israeli jails released and a significant increase in humanitarian aid allowed into Gaza. Some 60 lorries carrying medical supplies, fuel and food entered from Egypt on Friday. Hamas took more than 200 hostages during a cross-border attack on southern Israel on 7 October in which 1,200 people were killed. Human rights organisations say the number of Palestinians held without charge in Israeli jails has shot up since the 7 October attacks. There are now thought to be more than 6,000 Palestinians held by Israel on security grounds - many still awaiting trial. Almost every Palestinian family in the West Bank is thought to have had a relative detained by Israel at some point in the past - often in jails inside Israel, making it difficult or impossible for their relatives to visit.

        "title": "Sri Lanka to amend National Hydrology Act to boost revenue through electronic navigation charts",
        "date": "November 25, 2023 09:25 am",
        "content": "Plans are afoot to amend the National Hydrology Act, paving the way for the creation of Electronic Navigation Charts (ENCs) that could generate an estimated 200 million annually from ships traversing near Sri Lankan waters, Defence State Minister Premitha Bandara Tennakoon says. He made these remarks while addressing a press briefing held under the theme Collective Path to a Stable Country, at the Presidential Media Centre (PMC) on Friday (Nov.24). The state minister pointed out that the existing nautical charts are managed by the British Hydrographical Office according to an agreement with the NARA Institute. Therefore, steps will be taken to hand over the responsibility of creating ENC to the Navy in the future. Tennakoon said he was appointed to the position by President Ranil Wickremesinghe during a challenging period when national security and the rule of law had collapsed in the country. At that time, people were tired of queuing for fuel and gas. Under the right leadership of President Ranil Wickremesinghe, it has been possible to bring the countrys situation to a much better level than it was then. Commending the Presidents leadership, Tennakoon spoke of the improvements made in national security and the economy. He stressed the continual importance of ensuring national security, citing lessons learned from the Easter Sunday attacks, emphasizing the obligation of the army to safeguard citizens regardless of race, religion, or caste. The role of ensuring national security cannot be dismissed by simply stating that there is no war in a country. As a nation, we understood this lesson vividly during the Easter Sunday attack. A countrys army exists to ensure the security of the entire nation, obligated to safeguard every citizen regardless of race, religion, or caste. The budget of the Ministry of Defence has been passed in Parliament. In any country around the world, a significant allocation of funds is made for the security of the nation. However, some politicians are misleading the people by claiming that the amount allocated for our countrys national security is excessive. Its important to note that the funds allocated to the Ministry of Defence are not solely for the maintenance of the three armed forces; there are 23 institutions under the Ministry of Defence. Addressing budget allocations, Tennakoon clarified that out of the total of Rs. 423 billion allocated this year, only Rs. 169 billion were designated for the armed forces, while the remaining funds supported disaster management, meteorological departments, and various institutions under the Ministry of Defence. He highlighted the diverse roles of these institutions, including educational establishments like the National Cadet Corps, Civil Defence Department, and Kotelawala Defence University. Approximately 200,000 patients receive treatment in the outpatient department of Kotelawala Defence University Hospital each year, where military personnel also play a crucial role. Its essential to recognize that military personnel not only serve in defense but also take the lead during times of national disasters. Consequently, its important for everyone to understand that the funds allocated to the Ministry of Defence are not exclusively for the army. Notable allocations in the budget include Rs. 2.5 million for a task force to prevent human trafficking and efforts by the Navy to intercept drugs valued at Rs. 33,917 million. The state minister outlined plans to revitalize the National Hydrological Office to capitalize on the approximately 45,000 ships passing near Sri Lanka annually. The creation of ENCs is essential to harness income potential from this maritime traffic. Unfortunately, the institutions entrusted with this responsibility have neglected their duties since 1983, resulting in the current nautical charts being over a hundred years old. In line with the recommendations of the International Hydrographical Office, the use of printed nautical charts is set to be completely phased out by the year 2026. Consequently, the transition to electronic navigation maps is imperative. At present, the NARA Institute has entered into an agreement with the British Hydrographical Office for the creation of nautical maps covering the ocean region belonging to Sri Lanka. Hence, the time has arrived for Sri Lanka to establish itself as a nation capable of creating nautical maps. To achieve this goal, the President has introduced a new bill to Parliament, aiming to empower the hydrological office by amending the existing legislation. Once the Act is passed, the responsibility for creating electronic navigational maps will be transferred to the Navy. In the interim, the country has incurred substantial financial losses, amounting to billions of rupees in revenue. The indirect losses, particularly from insurance surcharges, have been even more significant. Fortunately, owing to the Presidents judicious decisions, the Navy has willingly accepted this responsibility. It is estimated that this initiative could yield approximately 200 million per year, with the potential for even higher indirect income. In 2024, steps will be taken with the support of a World Bank loan to modernize and enhance the accuracy of forecasts in the Department of Meteorology (Weather Intelligence). Many countries generate income through high technology, and recognizing this, efforts are underway to issue precise weather forecasts by leveraging advanced technical equipment and providing comprehensive training to officials. Simultaneously, through the National Building Research Institute, there is an initiative to legislate a Building Code for the future. Without such a code, there is a risk of issues arising from buildings constructed without proper standards. The National Building Research Institute has been entrusted with this responsibility, and there is a directive to complete the preparation by the year 2024. This effort aims to establish a certain standard and responsibility for the buildings constructed in the country.",

        "date": "November 25, 2023 10:00 am",
        "content": "Derek Chauvin, the former Minneapolis police officer convicted of murdering George Floyd, was stabbed by another inmate and seriously injured Friday at a federal prison in Arizona, a person familiar with the matter told The Associated Press. The attack happened at the Federal Correctional Institution, Tucson, a medium-security prison that has been plagued by security lapses and staffing shortages. The person was not authorized to publicly discuss details of the attack and spoke to the AP on the condition of anonymity. The Bureau of Prisons confirmed that an incarcerated person was assaulted at FCI Tucson at around 12:30 p.m. local time Friday. In a statement, the agency said responding employees contained the incident and performed life-saving measures before the inmate, who it did not name, was taken to a hospital for further treatment and evaluation. No employees were injured and the FBI was notified, the Bureau of Prisons said. Visiting at the facility, which has about 380 inmates, has been suspended. Messages seeking comment were left with Chauvins lawyers and the FBI. Chauvins stabbing is the second high-profile attack on a federal prisoner in the last five months. In July, disgraced sports doctor Larry Nassar was stabbed by a fellow inmate at a federal penitentiary in Florida. It is also the second major incident at the Tucson federal prison in a little over a year. In November 2022, an inmate at the facilitys low-security prison camp pulled out a gun and attempted to shoot a visitor in the head. The weapon, which the inmate shouldnt have had, misfired and no one was hurt. Chauvin, 47, was sent to FCI Tucson from a maximum-security Minnesota state prison in August 2022 to simultaneously serve a 21-year federal sentence for violating Floyds civil rights and a 22½-year state sentence for second-degree murder. Chauvins lawyer, Eric Nelson, had advocated for keeping him out of general population and away from other inmates, anticipating hed be a target. In Minnesota, Chauvin was mainly kept in solitary confinement largely for his own protection, Nelson wrote in court papers last year. Last week, the U.S. Supreme Court rejected Chauvins appeal of his murder conviction. Separately, Chauvin is making a longshot bid to overturn his federal guilty plea, claiming new evidence shows he didnt cause Floyds death. Floyd, who was Black, died on May 25, 2020, after Chauvin, who is white, pressed a knee on his neck for 9½ minutes on the street outside a convenience store where Floyd was suspected of trying to pass a counterfeit 20 bill. Bystander video captured Floyds fading cries of I cant breathe. His death touched off protests worldwide, some of which turned violent, and forced a national reckoning with police brutality and racism. Three other former officers who were at the scene received lesser state and federal sentences for their roles in Floyds death. Chauvins stabbing comes as the federal Bureau of Prisons has faced increased scrutiny in recent years following wealthy financier Jeffrey Epsteins jail suicide in 2019. Its another example of the agencys inability to keep even its highest profile prisoners safe after Nassars stabbing and Unabomber Ted Kaczynskis suicide at a federal medical center in June. An ongoing AP investigation has uncovered deep, previously unreported flaws within the Bureau of Prisons, the Justice Departments largest law enforcement agency with more than 30,000 employees, 158,000 inmates and an annual budget of about 8 billion. AP reporting has revealed rampant sexual abuse and other criminal conduct by staff, dozens of escapes, chronic violence, deaths and severe staffing shortages that have hampered responses to emergencies, including inmate assaults and suicides. Bureau of Prisons Director Colette Peters was brought in last year to reform the crisis-plagued agency. She vowed to change archaic hiring practices and bring new transparency, while emphasizing that the agencys mission is to make good neighbors, not good inmates. Testifying before the Senate Judiciary Committee in September, Peters touted steps shed taken to overhaul problematic prisons and beef up internal affairs investigations. This month, she told a House Judiciary subcommittee that hiring had improved and that new hires were outpacing retirements and other departures. But Peters has also irritated lawmakers who said she reneged on her promise to be candid and open with them. In September, senators scolded her for forcing them to wait more than a year for answers to written questions and for claiming that she couldnt answer basic questions about agency operations, like how many correctional officers are on staff.

        "content": "Presidents Counsel Saliya Pieris has refuted President Ranil Wickremesinghe that he had ambitions to become the Prime Minister prior to May 09, 2022. In a post on his Facebook account, the former president of the Bar Association of Sri Lanka (BASL) said the Head of State had falsely claimed this during the parliamentary session on Friday (Nov.24). Unfortunately, Mr. Wickremesinghe utters these lies under cover of immunity in Parliament where he cannot be replied to, Pieris said. Wickremesinghes remarks came in response to the allegations levelled at him by Tamil National Alliance MP M.A. Sumanthiran that he took over the PM post under former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa after violating a proposition made by the BASL. Refuting Sumanthirans claims, Wickremesinghe said he had neither met with the BASL members, nor signed any document compiled by the association. He also claimed that the BASL was under the impression that Saliya Pieris, PC would be given the premiership, adding that the May 09 protests changed the course of events. Meanwhile, Pieris said the BASLs proposals made in May 2022 were never about individuals, noting that these proposals were made after careful thought by its Executive Committee and approved by the Bar Council. He emphasized that the legal community had made these proposals with the intention of proposing a solution for Sri Lankas political and governance crisis with the interests of Sri Lanka and its people in mind. I am compelled to say that unlike politicians of his ilk, I have never placed personal ambitions above the needs of the country. I have never sacrificed my principles for personal gain or for the greed of office.",

        "title": "Only 31 out of 179 foreign investment projects efficacious: Parliamentary Committee",
        "date": "November 25, 2023 01:02 pm",
        "content": "The Sectoral Oversight Committee (SOC) on National Economic and Physical Plans has instructed the Department of Project Management and Monitoring to submit a progress report without delay as it was disclosed that only 31 out of 179 foreign investment projects are efficacious. The performance report of the Project Management and Monitoring Department was taken up for consideration at the SOC meeting on November 21, chaired by MP Mahindananda Aluthgamage. While it was disclosed that approximately Rs. 2.6 trillion had been received for Foreign Investment Projects from foreign-funded institutions, the SOC emphasized that it is very regrettable that the foreign loans and grants obtained for the countrys capital expenditure through such projects were not properly implemented to achieve the desired results through the related projects. The SOC pointed out that the expected objectives are not being achieved through these projects. It said the foreign debt of the country is increasing rapidly, attributing the reason to the weakness of the relevant ministries and their operating institutions as well as the project monitoring units established for the implementation of these projects. Accordingly, the committee instructed the officials present to submit a report in this regard within one month. It also approved the performance report of the Project Management and Monitoring Department. Following the said discussions, 4 performance reports including the performance report of the Project Management and Monitoring Department and 3 annual reports were considered in the SOC on National Economy and Physical Planning. Accordingly, the 2022 Performance Report of Department of Public Finance, the 2022 Performance Report of the Department of National Planning, the 2020 Annual Report of the Ceylon Industrial Development Board, the 2020 Annual Report of the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Fund, 2021 Performance Report of Local Loans and Development Fund, 2022 Performance Report of Ministry of Plantation Industry were considered at the SOC meeting.",

        "title": "Squid Game The Challenge: Players want compensation over injuries",
        "date": "November 25, 2023 01:40 pm",
        "content": "Contestants on Netflixs Squid Game: The Challenge are seeking compensation for injuries they allegedly suffered on the show, their lawyers said. Express Solicitors is representing two players who it says suffered injuries such as hypothermia and nerve damage. Players competed for a 4.56m (3.63m) prize on the spin-off show, based on the hit South Korean drama Squid Game. A show spokesperson said in a statement: We take the welfare of our contestants extremely seriously. Studio Lambert, the company who co-produced the show for Netflix, has been contacted for comment. Express Solicitors claimed the unnamed contestants suffered the injuries when they had to stay motionless for hours in cold temperatures while filming. Daniel Slade, CEO of the UK firm, said: Contestants thought they were taking part in something fun and those injured did not expect to suffer as they did. Now they have been left with injuries after spending time being stuck in painful stress positions in cold temperatures. We have a case where someone complains of hypothermia. One had his hands turn purple from the cold. The law firm said it has sent letters of claim to Studio Lambert outlining their clients alleged injuries it says were a result of poor health and safety standards on set. A letter of claim is a step before legal action - putting a person or organisation on notice court proceedings may be brought against them. The Green Light, Red Light game sees players run to a line while a 13.7ft (4.2m) doll sings and faces the wall. But players must stand still once the doll rotates its neck to face players. Those caught moving were eliminated using an automated video system with several adjudicators picking out players that moved. Stephen Lambert, CEO of Studio Lambert, previously said players who got across the line quickly took two hours to finish the game, but slower players took four or five hours. Everybody had been told it was going to be arduous, he said in press materials for the show. Contestant Lorenzo Nobilio told BBC News last week it took him seven hours to finish the game. In January Netflix said three people received medical treatment during filming, but claims of serious injury are untrue. Other contestants complained about the cold conditions in a report by Hollywood trade publication Variety. The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) confirmed it contacted the programmes producers after concerns were raised with them, but said it decided to take no further action and stressed to them the importance of planning properly for any risks in future filming. A spokesperson for Squid Game: The Challenge said: No lawsuit has been filed by any of the Squid Game contestants. We take the welfare of our contestants extremely seriously. The game was filmed at Cardington Studios in Bedford. Last week Mr Lambert told BBC News it took player welfare terribly seriously. He said: Everybody was warned that it was going to be cold, we took all the necessary steps to prepare them for that. Yes, a few anonymous people were unhappy about the fact they had been eliminated and it had been a cold, quite long experience. But it was no worse than many unscripted shows... when youre giving away a huge prize it is always going to be to clear to us it was going to be a tough show to take part in.
