        "title": "Russia closes airport in Dagestan after hundreds storm flight arriving from Tel Aviv",
        "date": "October 30, 2023 04:21 pm",
        "content": "Hundreds of people stormed into the main airport in Russias Dagestan region and onto the landing field Sunday, chanting antisemitic slogans and seeking passengers arriving on a flight from Tel Aviv, Israel, Russian news agencies and social media reported. Russian news reports said the crowd surrounded the airliner, which belonged to Russian carrier Red Wings. Authorities closed the airport in Makhachkala, the capital of the predominantly Muslim region, and police converged on the facility. Dagestans Ministry of Health said more than 20 people were injured, with two in critical condition. It said the injured included police officers and civilians. Video on social media showed some in the crowd waving Palestinian flags and others trying to overturn a police car. Antisemitic slogans can be heard being shouted and some in the crowd examined the passports of arriving passengers, apparently in an attempt to identify those who were Israeli. In a statement Sunday night, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahus office said Israel expects the Russian law enforcement authorities to protect the safety of all Israeli citizens and Jews wherever they may be and to act resolutely against the rioters and against the wild incitement directed against Jews and Israelis. Netanyahus office added that the Israeli ambassador to Russia was working with Russia to keep Israelis and Jews safe. The Ministry of Internal Affairs for Russias North Caucasian Federal District, where Dagestan is located, said that CCTV footage would be used to establish the identities of those who stormed the airport and that those involved would be brought to justice. While voicing support for Palestinians in Gaza, the regional Dagestani government appealed to citizens to remain calm and not take part in such protests. We urge residents of the republic to treat the current situation in the world with understanding. Federal authorities and international organizations are making every effort to bring about a ceasefire against Gaza civilians  we urge residents of the republic not to succumb to the provocations of destructive groups and not to create panic in society, the Dagestani government wrote on Telegram. The Supreme Mufti of Dagestan, Sheikh Akhmad Afandi, called on residents to stop the unrest at the airport. You are mistaken. This issue cannot be resolved in this way. We understand and perceive your indignation very painfully.  We will solve this issue differently. Not with rallies, but appropriately. Maximum patience and calm for you, he said in a video published to Telegram. Dagestan Gov. Sergei Melikov promised consequences for anyone who took part in the violence. The actions of those who gathered at the Makhachkala airport today are a gross violation of the law!  (W)hat happened at our airport is outrageous and should receive an appropriate assessment from law enforcement agencies! And this will definitely be done! he wrote on Telegram. He called the protests a knife in the backs of those who gave their lives for the security of the Motherland, referring to the 1999 war in Dagestan and troops currently fighting in Ukraine. Russias civilian aviation agency, Rosaviatsia, later reported that the airfield had been cleared, but that the airport would remain closed to incoming aircraft until Nov. 6.

The purpose of their visit was to assess the progress of the Climate Smart Irrigated Agriculture Project (CSIAP), the Presidents Media Division (PMD) said in a statement. Ms. Anna Bjerde made her first visit to the country in response to a request made by President Ranil Wickremesinghe during his special meeting with the President of the World Bank, Mr. Ajay Banga. This meeting occurred during President Wickremesinghes visit to the USA to attend the UN Summit. During their discussion, President Wickremesinghe requested Mr. Bangas assistance in advancing Sri Lankas climate-friendly sustainable agriculture initiative. Ms. Bjerdes visit to Sri Lanka serves as a confirmation of the World Banks support for this initiative, the PMD said. The CSIAP has undertaken an ambitious initiative to establish a comprehensive Farmer Training School known as Deshaguna Suhuru Govi Puhunu Pasala in Mannakkulama Village, Thirappane, situated in the Anuradhapura District. This Farmer Training School will play a pivotal role in training and equipping farmers with hands-on experience in Climate Smart Agriculture (CSA) practices and cutting-edge agricultural technologies. This visit by Ms. Anna Bjerde and Martin Raiser, the Vice President for the South Asia Region and a delegation from the World Bank, Asia Development Bank, JICA and USAID underscores the World Banks and other partners commitment to supporting initiatives that aim to improve the agricultural sector and enhance climate resilience in Sri Lankas dry zone. Following her visit to the Climate Smart Farmer Training School (FTS) in Thirappane, Ms. Anna Bjerde and the delegation of officials visited the Ambul Banana Cluster in Rajanganaya. This project supports smallholder farmer clusters in the project districts to produce high value agricultural products in order to improve the farmer household income significantly as well as to increase the export earnings of the country, the statement added. Expressing her views at the event, Ms. Anna Bjerde, Managing Director for Operations of the World Bank, addressed the significance of a school for farmers in the region, focusing on climate-smart agriculture. She highlighted the changing weather patterns caused by climate change and how this school is equipping farmers with techniques to enhance productivity and resilience in crop production. Ms. Bjerde also mentioned three major benefits of this project: the transition to renewable energy, particularly solar power; increased and stable livelihoods, enabling children to access education, including higher education; and diversified and sustainable crop yields, ensuring better nutrition. She expressed pride in the World Banks support for this project and emphasized the need for more initiatives like this to address the challenges posed by climate change, both through mitigation and adaptation efforts. She hoped that the project could be sustained building on the lessons and experiences demonstrating the positive impact on changing lives and livelihoods of farmer communities. Farmers who had undergone training in Climate Smart Irrigated Agriculture at the Farmer Training School received certificates during this event. Among those who attended the event were the Minister of Agriculture and Plantation Industries Mahinda Amaraweera, State Minister of Finance Shehan Semasinghe, Former Minister Duminda Dissanayake, Mr. Martin Raiser, Vice President  South Asia Region, World Bank, Mr Takafumi Kadono  Country Director, ADB, Ms Chiyo Kanda  Country Manager for Maldives and Sri Lanka, World Bank, Ms Anjali Kaur  Deputy Assistant Administrator, USAID, Mr. Faris Hadad  Zervos  Country Director for Nepal, Maldives and Sri Lanka, World Bank, Ms Sachiko Imoto  Senior Vice President, JICA and officials from the Ministry of Agriculture, according to the PMD.",

As such, VAT will be raised from 15 to 18 with effect from January 01, 2024. Additionally, the VAT will be imposed on certain goods and services on which the tax is not yet applicable. Further, some of the new tax proposals will also be implemented with effect from January 01, 2024, to enable the realization of tax revenue and primary balance targets as agreed with the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The decision was taken after observing that the tax collection targets agreed with the IMF are yet to be accomplished. The government mentioned that state tax revenue of the first 09 months of 2023 has gone up by 51 compared to the year 2022 after various tax-based increases and developmental tax policy proposals were implemented from June 2022 for the state financial stability based on the income, with the objective of ensuring loan sustainability. Public revenue increased to 1.7 trillion rupees (5.19 billion) in the first nine months when compared to last year but this amount is barely sufficient to pay public sector salaries, meet welfare payments and other recurrent expenditure, Gunawardana, who is the cabinet spokesman, told reporters. We know the public is struggling, so even though we are very reluctant to we have no choice but to increase taxes, he said.

        "title": "Israel military says soldier captured by Hamas freed in Gaza",
        "date": "October 31, 2023 12:58 pm",
        "content": "Israeli ground forces pushed deeper into Gaza on Monday, advancing in tanks and other armored vehicles on the territorys main city and freeing a soldier held captive by Hamas militants. The Israeli prime minister rejected calls for a cease-fire as airstrikes landed near hospitals where thousands of Palestinians are sheltering beside the wounded. The military said a soldier captured during Hamas brutal Oct. 7 incursion was rescued in Gaza  the first rescue since the weekslong war began. Military officials provided few details but said in a statement that Pvt. Ori Megidish, 19, was doing well and had met with her family. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu welcomed her home, saying the achievement by Israels security forces illustrates our commitment to free all the hostages. He also rejected calls for a cease-fire to facilitate the release of captives or end the war, which he has said will be long and difficult. Calls for a cease-fire are calls for Israel to surrender to Hamas, he told a news conference. That will not happen. Netanyahu, who faces mounting anger over Israels failure to prevent the worst surprise attack on the country in a half century, also said he had no plans to resign. Hamas and other militant groups are believed to be holding some 240 captives, including men, women and children. Netanyahu has faced increasing pressure to secure their release even as Israel acts to crush Hamas and end its 16-year rule over the territory. Hamas, which has released four hostages, has said it would let the others go in return for thousands of Palestinian prisoners held by Israel, including many implicated in deadly attacks on Israelis. Israel has dismissed the offer, and Netanyahu said the ground invasion creates the possibility of getting the hostages out, adding that Hamas will only do it under pressure. Hamas released a short video Monday purporting to show three other female captives. One delivers a brief statement  likely under duress  criticizing Israels response to the hostage crisis. It was not clear when the Hamas video was made. The Associated Press usually refrains from reporting details of hostage videos because they show individuals speaking under duress and are often used for propaganda purposes. Amos Aloni, whose daughter Danielle appeared in the video, told reporters that he and his wife were shocked to see her on TV but felt relief from her being alive and seeing her. The U.S. is providing weapons shipments on an almost daily basis to Israel, Pentagon deputy press secretary Sabrina Singh told reporters. Despite the rising number of civilian casualties, we are not putting any limits on how Israel uses weapons, Singh said. That is really up to the Israeli Defense Force. The Israeli military has been vague about its operations inside Gaza, including the location and number of troops. Israel has declared a new phase in the war but stopped short of declaring an all-out ground invasion. Larger ground operations have been launched both north and east of Gaza City. Israel says many of Hamas forces and much of its militant infrastructure, including hundreds of kilometers (miles) of tunnels, are in Gaza City, which before the war was home to over 650,000 people, a population comparable to that of Washington, D.C. Though Israel ordered Palestinians to leave the north, where Gaza City is located, and move south, hundreds of thousands remain, in part because Israel has also bombarded targets in so-called safe zones. Around 117,000 displaced people hoping for safety are staying in hospitals in northern Gaza, alongside thousands of patients and staff, according to U.N. figures. The U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, known as UNRWA, says nearly 672,000 Palestinians are sheltering in its schools and other facilities, which have reached four times their capacity. UNRWA head Philippe Lazzarini accused Israel of collective punishment of the Palestinians, and of forcing their displacement from northern Gaza to the south, where they are still not safe. The death toll among Palestinians passed 8,300, mostly women and children, the Gaza Health Ministry said Monday. The figure is without precedent in decades of Israeli-Palestinian violence. More than 1.4 million people in Gaza have fled their homes. Over 1,400 people have died on the Israeli side, mainly civilians killed during Hamas initial attack, also an unprecedented figure. Lazzarini said 64 of the agencys staff were killed in the past three weeks, the latest just hours before he addressed an emergency U.N. Security Council meeting, when an agency security official was killed with his wife and eight children. Most Palestinians in Gaza feel trapped in a war they have nothing to do with, he said. Video circulating on social media showed an Israeli tank and bulldozer in central Gaza blocking the territorys main north-south highway. The video, taken by a local journalist, shows a car approaching an earth barrier across the road. The car stops and turns around. As it heads away, a tank appears to open fire, and an explosion engulfs the car. The journalist, in another car, races away in terror, screaming, Go back! Go back! at approaching vehicles. The Gaza Health Ministry later said three people were killed in the car that was hit. Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, an Israeli military spokesman, declined to comment on where Israeli forces are deployed, but said additional forces had entered Gaza and operations would continue to expand and intensify. The military said troops have killed dozens of militants who attacked from inside buildings and tunnels. It said that in the last few days, it had struck more than 600 militant targets, including weapons depots and anti-tank missile launching positions. Palestinian militants have continued firing rockets into Israel, including toward its commercial hub, Tel Aviv. Hamas said its fighters clashed with Israeli troops who entered from the northwest. It was not possible to independently confirm battlefield claims made by either side. Meanwhile, crowded hospitals in northern Gaza came under growing threat. Gazas Health Ministry shared video footage that appeared to show an explosion and a column of smoke near the Turkish-Palestinian Friendship Hospital for cancer patients. The hospital director, Dr. Sobhi Skaik, said it had sustained damage in a strike that endangered patients. All 10 hospitals operating in northern Gaza have received evacuation orders, the U.N.s office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs said. Staff have refused to leave, saying evacuation would mean death for patients on ventilators. Strikes hit within 50 meters (yards) of Al Quds Hospital after it received two calls from Israeli authorities on Sunday ordering it to evacuate, the Palestinian Red Crescent rescue service said. Some windows were blown out, and rooms were covered in debris. It said 14,000 people are sheltering there. Israel says it targets Hamas fighters and infrastructure and that the militants operate among civilians, putting them in danger. Beyond the fighting, conditions for civilians in Gaza are continually deteriorating. With no central power for weeks and little fuel, hospitals are struggling to keep emergency generators running to operate incubators and other life-saving equipment. UNRWA has been trying to keep water pumps and bakeries running. On Sunday, the largest convoy of humanitarian aid yet  33 trucks  entered the territory from Egypt, and another 26 entered Monday. Relief workers say the amount is still far less than what is needed for the population of 2.3 million people. The fighting has raised concerns that the violence could spread across the region. Israel and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah have engaged in daily skirmishes along Israels northern border. In the occupied West Bank, Israel carried out airstrikes Monday against militants clashing with its forces in the Jenin refugee camp. Hamas said four of its fighters were killed there. As of Sunday, Israeli forces and settlers have killed 123 Palestinians, including 33 minors, in the West Bank, half of them during search-and-arrest operations, the U.N. said.

        "content": "The five-member experts committee comprising Judicial Medical Officers appointed to uncover the actual cause of death of the renowned businessman Dinesh Schaffter has submitted its report on the post-mortems to the Colombo Additional Magistrates Court, Ada Derana reporter said. Accordingly, the court is slated to announce its determination on the cause of the businessmans death tomorrow (Nov. 01), according to the reporter. The five-member experts committee comprising Judicial Medical Officers appointed to uncover the actual cause of death of renowned businessman Dinesh Schaffter, has submitted its report on the post-mortems to the Colombo Additional Magistrates Court, Ada Derana reporter said. Accordingly, the court is slated to announce its determination on the cause of the businessmans death tomorrow (Nov. 01), according to the reporter. However, the relatives of the deceased businessman have requested the court to allow their attorneys to present facts regarding the post-mortem examination report, following the report being submitted. Additional Magistrate Rajindra Jayasuriya, who rejected the request, pointed out that the only thing that takes place in the post-mortem examination is to uncover the actual reason that caused the death of a person, and that there is no provision available in the law that allows an external party to present facts regarding the matter. Thus, the Additional Magistrate ordered the Criminal Investigations Department (CID) to take measures to hand over the remains of the late businessman, which are currently placed in the Karapitiya Teaching Hospital to his family members. She also ordered to provide necessary facilities for the burial of the remains at the Jawatte Cemetery, as per the previous court orders. Furthermore, the Additional Magistrate expressed her gratitude to the members of the experts committee for assisting in the relevant investigation.",

        "date": "October 31, 2023 01:49 pm",
        "content": "The court has imposed overseas travel bans on the owner of the company, which allegedly used forged documents to import substandard medicines, and two other higher government officials who were involved in this fraudulent activity. The relevant order has been issued by the Maligakanda Magistrates Court in consideration of the facts presented by the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) through a motion that the concerned suspects were preparing to flee the country. Accordingly, overseas travel bans were imposed on the company owner named Sugath Janaka Fernando alias Aruna Deepthi, Chief Executive Officer of the National Medicines Regulatory Authority (NMRA) Dr. Vijith Gunasekara and Director (Supplies Division) of the Ministry of Health Dr. Kapila Wickramanayake this manner. Earlier this month, the NMRA had said a batch of human intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), imported to Sri Lanka from India in violation of the due procedure, was suspended from use. In a media release, NMRA chairman Prof. S. D. Jayaratne had said forged documents were found to have been submitted for Customs clearance when importing the drug which later failed the quality tests. The product, manufactured by Livealth Biopharma Pvt Ltd. India, was imported by a local medicine supplier called Isolez Biotech Pharma AG (Pvt) Ltd. It was reported that funds amounting to Rs. 130 million were misappropriated as a result of this unlawful importation of 22,500 vials of IVIG. The NMRA had said the situation came to light following reports of allergic reactions after the drug was administered to several patients under treatment at the Colombo National Hospital and the Matale District Hospital on August 22 and September 16, respectively. Meanwhile, the sub-committee appointed by the Committee on Public Accounts (COPA) has instructed the University of Moratuwa to carry out a formal study of the Ministry of Healths information management system and to submit a report.",

        "date": "October 31, 2023 02:56 pm",
        "content": "Two people have been injured in a shooting at a hospital in the central Japanese city of Toda, local media report. The suspect, possibly in his 40s or 50s, fled on a motorcycle and is currently at large. Meanwhile, at least one person has been taken hostage inside a post office in neighbouring Warabi, the city said. It is as yet unclear if the two incidents are connected. Japanese media has aired footage of a man carrying a gun and standing at the entrance of a post office near the Toda Chuo General Hospital where the two people were shot. The two injured people have been identified as an doctor and an elderly patient. The post office mentioned by Warabi authorities is about 2.5 km (1.5 mi) from the Toda Chuo General Hospital. Footage also showed police and ambulances surrounding the area. Police said someone reported a gun being fired in the hospital at around 13:00 local time (06:00 GMT). The hostage situation in Warabi was reported around 14:15. Tokyo police have displaced officers from a special investigations team that handles hostage situations to the scene, according to Japanese broadcaster NHK. Authorities also asked people living within a 300m radius of the Warabi post office to leave the area, according to local media. Buildings nearby have also been placed on lockdown. Shootings are rare in Japan. The country has strict gun ownership rules, and only allows civilians to own hunting rifles and airguns. Owners must undergo a strict exam and mental health tests.

        "title": "Scientists from China, Sri Lanka conduct joint marine scientific research onboard Chinese vessel",
        "date": "October 31, 2023 03:52 pm",
        "content": "Scientists from China and Sri Lanka are conducting a joint marine scientific activities on board a Chinese research vessel, a senior official said Tuesday, amid concerns voiced by India and the US. The Chinese ship, Shi Yan 6 arrived at the Colombo port last week. According to sources, Sri Lanka was delaying granting permission for the arrival of the vessel due to concerns raised by India. However, there is no official confirmation of the same. Clearance was granted to carry out marine scientific research on 30 and 31 October, a spokesman for the Colombo Foreign Ministry said. The vessel is currently located off the western waters, he said. Scientists from the National Aquatic Research Agency (NARA), personnel from the Navy and the University of Ruhuna were given clearance to go on board, he added. Director General of NARA Dr Kamal Tennakoon said the vessel is engaged in research activities in the seas off Bentara in Colombo. The Chinese geophysical scientific research vessel commenced research operations in the Sea of Sri Lanka on Monday. Described as a ResearchSurvey Vessel with a carrying capacity of 1,115 DWT, the vessel is reported to be 5.3 metres in length overall 90.6 metres and width 17 metres. It is said to be Chinas first scientific research vessel focusing on geophysical exploration. NARA said samples of different seawater levels will also be tested. Four NARA officials joined the research activities while two Navy officers also joined the research team. The ship was expected to bring back the Sri Lankan personnel on board to Colombo off the western waters tomorrow at the conclusion of the activities, the spokesman said. The vessel had applied to do a joint survey of Sri Lankas marine borders, officials said. However, the research would now be limited to western waters. In August, permission was sought by the Chinese research vessel to conduct marine research activities in October. The arrival of Shi Yan 6 followed President Ranil Wickremesinghes visit to China last week. Last month, the US expressed concern to Sri Lanka about the scheduled visit of the Chinese research ship to the island nation. US Under Secretary Victoria Nuland, who met Sri Lankan Foreign Minister Ali Sabry in New York on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly session, had reportedly raised concerns about the visit of SHI YAN 6. China dispatches its researchsurveillance vessels to Sri Lanka on a regular basis. India has been raising concerns over the visits of Chinese vessels to Lanka. The Government of India raised concern over the visit of the Chinese Peoples Liberation Army Navy warship HAI YANG 24 in mid-August. On a similar visit by a Chinese satellite tracking ship in early 2022, the Indians protested strongly. However, after a considerable delay, Sri Lanka allowed the ship to dock at the southern port of Hambantota, a port in Sri Lankas south under a 99-year lease to the Chinese company that built it after Colombo was unable to service a 1.4 billion loan taken for the project. In August last year, a similar visit by the Chinese ballistic missile and satellite tracking ship, Yuan Wang 5, which arrived in the southern Sri Lankan port of Hambantota elicited strong reactions from India. Cash-strapped Sri Lanka considers both India and China equally important partners in its task to restructure its external debt. China is one of the top lenders to Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka owes USD 7.1 billion to bilateral creditors, including USD 3 billion to China. The island nation was hit by an unprecedented financial crisis in 2022, the worst since its independence from Britain in 1948, due to a severe paucity of foreign exchange reserves.

        "content": "At the second high-level roundtable discussion on Crisis to Recovery today (Oct. 31), both developmental partners and the private sector have expressed overwhelming commitment and confidence in the Sri Lankan governments current reform efforts. Todays roundtable has provided an open and candid forum between the government of Sri Lanka, the developmental partners and the private sector to share key updates and recommendations to sustain the momentum of the nations reform efforts, the Presidents Media Division (PMD) said. Marking a significant momentum of the economic recovery and stabilization, the second high-level roundtable discussion on Crisis to Recovery was held this morning in Colombo. This event follows the previous session in December 2022 and provides a forum to discuss the progress of the governments reform programs aimed at addressing key economic and structural issues. The event also focuses on transitioning from crisis recovery to a sustainable growth path, challenges and opportunities for attracting investment, promoting private capital mobilization, creating jobs, and maintaining commitments by the government and participating partners towards Sri Lankas greener, resilient, and inclusive development, the PMD added. The session was opened by President Ranil Wickremesinghe, representing the Sri Lankan government. He has delivered an address on the growth and strategic directions for Sri Lanka as it moves from recovery to a sustainable growth path.

During the previous session in December 2022, representatives from the World Bank, ADB, IMF and AIIB had emphasized that a coordinated assistance program, supported by the multilateral financial institutions, is required for Sri Lanka to recover from the economic crisis currently facing the country. The Sri Lankan economy has shown initial signs of stabilization, with moderating inflation, easing foreign exchange liquidity pressures, and some progress on debt restructuring, including the approval of the domestic debt restructuring strategy. Under the Sri Lankan governments reform program, underpinned by the IMF Extended Fund Facility (EFF) and supported by other development partners, cornerstone legislation is being developed, and structural reforms are being implemented to restore stability and regain access to international financial markets. However, the path to recovery remains narrow, with limited fiscal and external buffers, the PMD said further.",

        "date": "October 31, 2023 11:54 pm",
        "content": "Sri Lanka is set to award a multi-billion dollar oil refinery project to a Chinese state-owned company after a rival bidder pulled out, the energy minister said Tuesday. Kanchana Wijesekera said the government would shortly enter into an investment agreement with Sinopec to build the refinery next to the Chinese-run port at the southern town of Hambantota. There were only two bidders shortlisted and Vitol pulled out. That leaves only Sinopec and we will finalise an agreement with them in a couple of weeks, Wijesekera told reporters in Colombo. Sri Lanka had originally awarded the project, which has an estimated cost of 3.85 billion, to an Indian family-owned company based in Singapore in 2019. After Silver Park International failed to start construction, the government terminated the agreement in August, repossessing 1,200 acres (485 hectares) of land allocated for the refinery. The nearby Hambantota deep sea port was controversially leased to a Chinese state-owned firm in 2017 for 99 years after Sri Lanka was unable to service a 1.4 billion loan taken for the project. Sri Lanka defaulted on its 46 billion external debt last year in an unprecedented economic crisis partly blamed on Chinese loans used to build several white-elephant infrastructure projects between 2005 and 2015. China owns 52 percent of Sri Lankas bilateral debt, and Beijings approval is crucial for any efforts by Colombo to restructure its outstanding loans. Source: AFP -Agencies",

On Monday, a court had imposed overseas travel bans on the owner of the company, which is accused of using forged documents to import the substandard medicines, and two other high-ranking government officials who were allegedly involved in this fraudulent activity. The relevant order was issued by the Maligakanda Magistrates Court after considering the facts presented by the CID through a motion, claiming that the concerned suspects were preparing to flee the country. Accordingly, overseas travel bans were imposed on the companys owner Sugath Janaka Fernando, also known as Aruna Deepthi, Chief Executive Officer of the National Medicines Regulatory Authority (NMRA) Dr. Vijith Gunasekara and Director (Supplies Division) of the Ministry of Health Dr. Kapila Wickramanayake. Earlier this month, the NMRA had said a batch of human intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), imported to Sri Lanka from India in violation of the due procedure, was suspended from usage. In a media release, NMRA chairman Prof. S. D. Jayaratne had said forged documents were found to have been submitted for Customs clearance when importing the drug which had later failed the quality tests. The product, said to have been manufactured by Livealth Biopharma Pvt Ltd. India, was imported by a local medicine supplier called Isolez Biotech Pharma AG (Pvt) Ltd. It was reported that funds amounting to Rs. 130 million were misappropriated as a result of this unlawful importation of 22,500 vials of IVIG. The NMRA had said the situation came to light following reports of allergic reactions after the drug was administered to several patients under treatment at the Colombo National Hospital and the Matale District Hospital on August 22 and September 16, respectively. Meanwhile, the sub-committee appointed by the Committee on Public Accounts (COPA) has instructed the University of Moratuwa to carry out a formal study of the Ministry of Healths information management system and to submit a report.",

        "date": "November 1, 2023 08:53 am",
        "content": "The government is now calling for bids for the divestiture of the debt-ridden national carrier SriLankan Airlines, Minister of Ports, Shipping  Aviation says. As such, Invitations to Tenders (ITTs) have been published using local and foreign media and websites, according to Minister Nimal Siripala De Silva. The divestiture is planned to be completed through a two-stage competitive bidding process; RFQ (Request for Qualification) and RFP (Request for Proposals for the Proposed Transaction). In its notice calling for RFQs, the Finance Ministry noted that the Sri Lankan government is currently in the process of restructuring andor removing its debts or liabilities which are on the latest financial statements of the airlines. The bidders can submit prequalification applications between 9 a.m. and 2 p.m. on December 05, and prequalified bidders will be selected on December 19. Last month, Minister De Silva, joining Ada Deranas State of the Nation program, addressed the reports alleging that the government is planning to sell off the national carrier by the end of 2024. Denying the claims, the Aviation Minister reiterated that the government intends to retain 51 of SriLankan Airlines shares and divest the remaining 49. He had mentioned that running the national carrier as a joint venture is the solution as SriLankan is in debt. The airlines total debt amounts to USD 1.2 billion. Sri Lanka is looking to cut down the losses incurred by state-owned enterprises under a USD 2.9 billion Extended Fund Facility (EFF) from the International Monetary Fund (IMF). In late October, the island nation secured a staff-level agreement on economic policies to conclude the first review of its 48-month EFF-supported program. The countrys economy is also seeing a gradual recovery from the crisis last year stemmed from record low reserves, sky-rocketing inflation and currency depreciation. Key highlights about SriLankan Airlines:  Founded in 1979, SriLankan Airlines operates with a fleet of 24 Airbus A320 and A330 aircraft and has a route network of 126 destinations in 61 countries.  Before the COVID-19 pandemic, SriLankan Airlines carried around 5 million passengers and 100,000 tons of cargo annually, with 15,000 flights per year.  The network of international destinations served by SriLankan Airlines has expanded from 37 destinations in 2019 to 39 in 2023. It has extensive landing rights in many Indian cities, with Male, Chennai, London, and Singapore being the largest destinations served, contributing to a combined 25 of the airlines seats.  The Air Services Agreement between Sri Lanka and India is highly liberal, allowing SriLankan Airlines-designated carriers unrestricted frequencies to the majority of Indian cities, including metros, along with fifth freedom traffic rights connecting SAARC countries.  Holder of IATA Operational Safety Audit (IOSA) certification, SriLankan Airlines is a predominantly foreign-exchange-earning business, expected to generate USD 1.1 billion in revenue from airline operations in 20232024  Holder of IATA Safety Audit for Ground Operations (ISAGO) certification, SriLankan Airlines is the sole ground handling operator at Colombo airport, expected to generate USD 60m in revenue in 202324  SriLankan Airlines subsidiary Srilankan Catering is the exclusive provider of catering services in Sri Lanka, expecting to generate over USD 40m in revenue in 202324",

Notably, the Presidential Secretariat was the first edifice catalogued in this decennial census. A remarkable feature of this years census is the fusion of modern technology with conventional paper documents for data collection. The deployment of tablet computers, Internet connectivity and geospatial technologies is a standout feature. The Presidents Media Division (PMD) said Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI), is being employed here for the first time. The listing phase, which is currently in progress, will be followed by the enumeration phase in 2024, according to the Department of Census and Statistics. The Population and Housing Census entails a comprehensive tally of all individuals and existing residences within a country over a specific timeframe. The process ensures that no person or dwelling is omitted or counted twice, the department emphasized. Population and Housing Census is the main source of official data for obtaining population and housing information down to the Grama Niladhari Division level. For this years census, around 16,000 enumerators were recruited, all of whom are government sector employees. Training of officers involved in the listing stage has already been started at the Divisional Secretariat office. Sri Lankas Population and Housing Census is conducted every ten years and is overseen by the Department of Census and Statistics. The previous census took place in 2012. Interestingly, the inaugural legally mandated census in Sri Lanka transpired on March 27, 1871, marking a pioneering scientific endeavour among South Asian nations. The Population and Housing Census is a vital source of data for shaping national policies, and public administration and understanding demographics, ethnic distribution and other social characteristics. The census encompasses housing information at the villages official division level. This comprehensive undertaking includes assigning a unique number to every building and obtaining GPS coordinates for each structure. Additionally, it results in digitized maps at the villages official division level.",

        "date": "November 1, 2023 12:47 pm",
        "content": "North Korea is poised to close as many as a dozen embassies including in Spain, Hong Kong, and multiple countries in Africa, according to media reports and analysts, in a move that could see nearly 25 percent of Pyongyangs missions close worldwide. North Koreas recent closing of its diplomatic missions was a sign that the reclusive country is struggling to make money overseas because of international sanctions, South Koreas unification ministry said on Tuesday. On Monday, North Korean state media outlet KCNA said the countrys ambassadors paid farewell visits to Angolan and Ugandan leaders last week, and local media in both African countries reported the shutdown of the Norths embassies there. Both Angola and Uganda have forged friendly ties with North Korea since the 1970s, maintaining military cooperation and providing rare sources of foreign currency such as statue-building projects. The embassy closings set the stage for what could be one of the countrys biggest foreign policy shakeups in decades, with implications for diplomatic engagement, humanitarian work in the isolated country, as well as the ability to generate illicit revenue, wrote Chad OCarroll, founder of the North Korea-focused website NK Pro. More than a dozen missions may close, likely because of international sanctions, a trend of Pyongyangs disengaging globally and the probable weakening of the North Korean economy, he said in a report on Wednesday. Seouls unification ministry, which handles inter-Korean affairs, said the pullout reflected the impact of international sanctions aimed at curbing funding for the Norths nuclear and missile programs. They appear to be withdrawing as their foreign currency earning business has stumbled due to the international communitys strengthening of sanctions, making it difficult to maintain the embassies any longer, the ministry said in a statement. This can be a sign of North Koreas difficult economic situation, where it is difficult to maintain even minimal diplomatic relations with traditionally friendly countries. North Korea has formal relations with 159 countries, but had 53 diplomatic missions overseas, including three consulates and three representative offices, until it pulled out of Angola and Uganda, according to the ministry. North Korea will also shut down its embassy in Spain, with its mission in Italy handling affairs in the neighbouring country, South Koreas Yonhap news agency reported. Correspondence with the Spanish Communist Party released on the partys website showed the North Korean embassy announcing the closing in a letter dated Oct. 26. The Norths embassy in Madrid was in the spotlight after members of a group seeking the overthrow of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un staged a break-in in 2019, during which they bound and gagged staff before driving off with computers and other devices. Pyongyang denounced the incident as a grave breach of sovereignty and terrorist attack, and accused the United States of not investigating the group thoroughly and refusing to extradite its leader.

        "content": "The Colombo Magistrates Court today (Nov. 01) determined that the death of renowned businessman Dinesh Schaffter was occurred as a result of an external pressure applied on his neck and the facial area. Accordingly, the magistrate who ruled that a crime had been committed through this incident, ordered the Director of the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) to arrest the relevant suspects and produce them before the courts. The five-member experts committee comprising Judicial Medical Officers appointed to uncover the actual cause of death of the late businessman Schaffter submitted its report on the post-mortems to the Colombo Additional Magistrates Court on Tuesday (Oct. 31). However, the relatives of the deceased businessman have requested the court to allow their attorneys to present facts regarding the post-mortem examination report, following the submission of the report. Additional Magistrate Rajindra Jayasuriya, who rejected the request, pointed out that the only thing that takes place in the post-mortem examination is to uncover the actual reason that caused the death of a person, and that there is no provision available in the law that allows an external party to present facts regarding the matter. Thus, the Additional Magistrate ordered the Criminal Investigations Department (CID) to take measures to hand over the remains of the late businessman, which are currently placed at the Karapitiya Teaching Hospital, to his family members. She also ordered to provide necessary facilities for the burial of the remains at the Jawatte Cemetery, as per the previous court orders. Director of the Janashakthi PLC Group, Dinesh Schaffter, was found tied up in his car at the General Cemetery in Borella on 15 December 2022 and died a day later while receiving treatment at the ICU of the National Hospital in Colombo.",

        "content": "The owner of the company, which allegedly used forged documents to import a batch of substandard human intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), has been remanded until November 15. The accused known as Aruna Deepthi, who was arrested by the Criminal Investigations Department (CID), was produced before Maligakanda Magistrates Court earlier today. On Monday, the court imposed overseas travel bans on the owner of the company, which is accused of using forged documents to import a batch of vials of substandard immunoglobulin, and two other high-ranking government officials who were allegedly involved in this fraudulent activity. Accordingly, Sugath Janaka Fernando, also known as Aruna Deepthi, Chief Executive Officer of the National Medicines Regulatory Authority (NMRA) Dr. Vijith Gunasekara and Director (Supplies Division) of the Ministry of Health Dr. Kapila Wickramanayake were barred from flying out of the country. Earlier this month, the National Medicines Regulatory Authority (NMRA) said that forged documents were found to have been submitted for Customs clearance when importing the drug which later failed the quality tests. The product, which was said to have been manufactured by Livealth Biopharma Pvt Ltd. India, was imported by a local medicine supplier called Isolez Biotech Pharma AG (Pvt) Ltd. However, the India-based manufacturer has denied having to do anything with this fraudulent activity and has communicated to the NMRA that it has neither manufactured, supplied nor exported these products to any party. It was found that funds amounting to Rs. 130 million were misappropriated through the unlawful importation of 22,500 vials of IVIG. The local medicines regulator recently said the situation came to light following reports of allergic reactions after the drug was administered to several patients being treated at the Colombo National Hospital and the Matale District Hospital on August 22 and September 16, respectively.",

        "date": "November 1, 2023 05:05 pm",
        "content": "Elon Musk has warned that artificial intelligence (AI), if programmed by people in the environmental movement, may lead to the extinction of humanity. Appearing on comedian Joe Rogans podcast on Tuesday, he said some people would use the tech to protect the planet by ending human life. He was speaking ahead of the UKs AI safety summit, now underway, where he is due to meet the UK Prime Minister. Many experts consider such warnings overblown. Nick Clegg, the president of global affairs at Meta and former deputy prime minister - who is also attending the summit - said there was a danger of focusing too much on what AI might look like in the future and ignoring problems in the here and now. People shouldnt let speculative, sometimes somewhat futuristic predictions crowd out more immediate challenges, he said. Mr Musk said his comments were born out of fears the environmental movement had gone too far. If you start thinking that humans are bad, then the natural conclusion is humans should die out, he said. If AI gets programmed by the extinctionists, its utility function will be the extinction of humanity they wont even think its bad. Mr Musk is due to speak to UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak on his platform X later on Thursday. AI is too important While few people share Mr Musks interpretation of the threat AI poses, many agree it has potential dangers. Speaking ahead of the summit, Demis Hassabis, the co-founder of Google Deepmind, one of the UKs biggest AI firms, said the move fast and break things mantra associated with Silicon Valley should be avoided. It has been extremely successful in building massive companies and providing us with lots of great services and applications, Mr Hassabis said. But AI is too important. Theres a lot of work that needs to be done to ensure that we understand AI systems and we know how to deploy them in safe and responsible ways. He identified potential risks including the risk of AI generating misinformation and deepfakes and the deliberate misuse of the tech by bad actors. Safety summit Over the next two days, around 100 world leaders, tech bosses, academics and AI researchers are gathering at the UKs Bletchley Park campus, once home to the codebreakers who helped secure victory during World War Two. They will take part in discussions about how best to maximise the benefits of artificial intelligence - such as discovering new medicines and being put to work on potential climate change solutions - while minimising the risks. The summit will focus on extreme threats posed by so-called frontier AI, the most advanced forms of the tech which Mr Hassabis described as the tip of the spear. The summits priorities include the threat of bio-terrorism and cyber attacks. International delegates include US Vice President Kamala Harris and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. China is also sending a representative. There has been some criticism that the guest list is dominated by US giants including ChatGPT creator OpenAI, Anthropic, Microsoft, Google and Amazon - as well as Tesla and X (formerly Twitter) owner Elon Musk. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak will livestream a conversation with Mr Musk on X on Thursday evening. Others have questioned whether announcements earlier this week from both the US and the G7 specifically about AI safety had overshadowed the event - but Mr Hassabis said the UK could still play an important role in shaping discussions. Kind of sci-fi Aidan Gomez, the founder of Cohere, has come to the UK from Toronto for the summit. His firm was valued at 2bn in May 2023. He said he believed there were more immediate threats than the doomsday Terminator scenario which he described as kind of sci-fi. In my personal opinion, I wish we would focus more near-term where theres concrete policy work to be done, he said. The technology is not ready to, for instance, prescribe drugs to patients, where an error could cost a human life. We really need to preserve human presence and oversight of these systems... we need regulation to help us steer and guide the acceptable use of this technology. Source: BBC --Agencies",

        "content": "The World Banks Managing Director for Operations, Anna Bjerde, concluded her four-day visit to Sri Lanka today (01), encouraging the Government of Sri Lanka to stay the course on reforms for recovery and sustainable growth. She also underscored the World Banks continuous commitment to investing in people, strengthening human capital, and creating jobs. Bjerde met with Sri Lankas President Ranil Wickremesinghe, cabinet ministers, representatives of opposition parties, civil society, private sector, development partners, and World Bank project beneficiaries. She participated in a roundtable hosted by the President with key ministers, private sector representatives, and development partnersincluding members of the MDB platform, which includes Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs) and bilateral development partners. The platform enables member institutions to coordinate their engagement with Sri Lanka. The roundtable focused on Sri Lankas progress on structural reforms, mobilizing private capital for development, supporting job creation, human capital development, and regional cooperation. As Sri Lanka recovers from a series of unprecedented shocks with devastating impacts, it is crucial to stay the course on sound and timely reforms in order to stabilize the economy while fostering economic growth that can attract investment, generate jobs, protect the poorest and most vulnerable, and build resilience to future crises. But equally important is the need to strengthen governance, citizen engagement, and social cohesion, a must for inclusive growth, said Bjerde. Her trip included visits to World Bank-supported projects in the Northern and North Central Provinces related to agriculture, health, climate change, private sector development, and financial inclusion for women. During my visit, I heard about the challenges Sri Lankans face. Skilled professionals are leaving the country, farmers are struggling to cope with a changing climate, and entrepreneurs are constrained by a lack of investment and access to credit. But I also saw huge opportunities to scale up climate-smart agriculture, harness renewable energy, boost entrepreneurship, promote competitiveness and regional connectivity, added Bjerde. The World Bank will continue to support Sri Lanka on its journey to recovery, connecting farmers to markets, strengthening access to healthcare, boosting innovation, pursuing transformation through infrastructure investments, and creating quality jobs for women and youth. The World Bank has been a partner to Sri Lanka for more than 70 years, providing financial and knowledge support to the country. At the onset of the economic crisis in May 2022, the World Bank moved fast to help protect the people of Sri Lankaparticularly the poor and vulnerablefrom the worst impacts by repurposing funds from the existing portfolio. In addition, the World Bank was one of the earliest responders to the crisis and initiated a coordination platform with the Asian Development Bank and the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank to align emergency assistance to help sustain basic services and commodities.",

        "date": "November 1, 2023 09:27 pm",
        "content": "Sagala Ratnayaka, the Senior Adviser on National Security and Chief of Presidential Staff to President Ranil Wickremesinghe, announced that the President will swiftly establish a high-level committee dedicated to the prevention and management of road accidents and their associated fatalities and disabilities. Mr. Sagala Ratnayaka made this declaration during his speech at the Safe Roads  Safe Children International Road Safety Conference-2023, which took place at the Galle Face Hotel in Colombo today (01). This conference was organized by the Expert Committee for Road Accident Prevention of the Sri Lanka Medical Association (SLMA) and primarily aimed to mitigate avoidable child fatalities and lifelong disabilities resulting from road accidents. The discussions at the conference covered various aspects such as education, healthcare, transportation and law enforcement in relation to road safety. Prof. Samath Dharmaratne, Chairman of the Expert Committee to Prevent Road Accidents, highlighted a troubling global statistic, revealing that a road accident leads to a fatality every 42 seconds worldwide. However, he also pointed out that high-income countries have relatively lower rates of disability and death due to road accidents compared to other nations. Additionally, Prof. Dharmaratne emphasized that in 2023, 115 children have tragically lost their lives as a result of road accidents in Sri Lanka. He noted that young individuals between the ages of 15 and 44, who form the workforce critical for the countrys development, are often the victims of these accidents, either losing their lives or facing disabilities. He further revealed that, on average, approximately 3,000 individuals lose their lives in road accidents in Sri Lanka each year and this concerning trend appears to be on the rise. Prof. Samath Dharmaratne underscored the alarming prospect that, in comparison to future accidents, the numbers of fatalities and individuals suffering from disabilities resulting from road accidents will surge by thousands, leading to substantial economic losses for the country. Given this dire situation, Prof. Dharmaratne stressed the urgent need for the establishment of a high-level committee dedicated to the prevention and management of road accidents and their related consequences. Mr. Sagala Ratnayaka, in his additional comments, shared that when initially invited to participate in the event, they were discussing the formation of a committee aimed at preventing and controlling road accidents, along with the associated deaths and disabilities. However, the event drew their attention to the necessity of a high-level committee headed by the Presidents Office or personally appointed by the President for this purpose. He acknowledged several critical issues, starting with the problem of reckless driving. Moreover, certain vehicles, such as three-wheelers commonly used in the country, fail to meet adequate safety standards. Mr. Ratnayaka recognized that an outright ban on three-wheelers is not feasible overnight, given the significant impact on the livelihoods of many and the transportation needs of the public. Therefore, he emphasized the need for a comprehensive plan to gradually enhance the safety of three-wheelers until the countrys economy reaches a more developed stage. The condition of the road infrastructure also received attention. Sri Lanka lacks an extensive road network and even its main roads often suffer from perilous conditions. The Southern Expressway, for instance, is susceptible to flooding during heavy rains. Mr. Ratnayaka proposed the creation of designated parking lanes to address problems related to vehicle issues or driver fatigue, offering a safe space for drivers to resolve these concerns. Furthermore, he recognized issues in the enforcement of law and order on the roads, including problems stemming from inadequate staffing and insufficient equipment and technology. However, Mr. Ratnayaka emphasized that waiting for a complete resolution of these issues would only exacerbate the problems. Instead, he advocated for the development of short-term, medium-term, and long-term plans to address road safety comprehensively, acknowledging that the committee tasked with this endeavour would need to consider numerous complex issues. Finally, he mentioned the Presidents appointment of a committee to formulate a policy on vehicle imports. This committee would evaluate whether the country should adopt an open policy on vehicle imports or implement a system similar to Singapore, where a fixed number of permits are issued each year for vehicle imports. Additionally, to ensure a sustainable balance in the number of vehicles on the road, theres a need to consider exporting a certain quantity of vehicles from the country. Moreover, its essential to explore the adoption of electric vehicles as an eco-friendly alternative to traditional diesel or petrol vehicles. This consideration should encompass factors like the future economic landscape and the state of the road infrastructure. The issue of road accidents also holds significant importance in this context. Consequently, the committee will engage in discussions with various stakeholders to formulate relevant plans. Mr. Ratnayaka further said, The scope of work is extensive and I firmly believe that now is the opportune moment to address these concerns. As a result, President Ranil Wickremesinghe will expeditiously establish a high-level committee dedicated to preventing and managing road accidents, along with their associated fatalities and disabilities. I should note that we have facilitated a meeting between the Sri Lanka Medical Associations (SLMA) Road Accident Prevention Expert Committee and the President to further delve into this matter. I extend my gratitude to all individuals who have tirelessly contributed to this cause. Minister of Education Susil Premajayanth, Minister of State for Transport Lasantha Alagiyawanna, Chairman of the National Drug Regulatory Authority Dr. Ananda Wijewickrama, Chairman of the Sri Lanka Medical Association Mr. Vinya Ariyaratne, and representatives from various fields, including Health, Information Technology, Engineering, Transport, as well as the three armed forces and the Sri Lanka Police.

        "title": "Yemens Houthi rebels claim attacks on Israel, drawing their main sponsor Iran closer to Hamas war",
        "date": "November 1, 2023 10:31 pm",
        "content": "Yemens Houthi rebels for the first time Tuesday claimed missile and drone attacks targeting Israel, drawing their main sponsor Iran closer into the ongoing Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip and further raising the risks of a regional conflict erupting. The Houthis had been suspected of an attack earlier this month targeting Israel by sending missiles and drones over the crucial shipping lane of the Red Sea, an assault that saw the U.S. Navy shoot down the projectiles. This time on Tuesday, however, Israel said its own fighter jets and its new Arrow missile defense system shot down two salvos of incoming fire hours apart as it approached the countrys key Red Sea shipping port of Eilat. The Houthis, who have held Yemens capital, Sanaa, since 2014 as part of that countrys ruinous war, claimed three attacks on Israel in a later military statement, without elaborating on the timeframe of the operations and whether Tuesdays salvos represented one or two attacks. Beyond the attack that saw the U.S. shoot down missiles, there had been a mysterious explosion Thursday that hit the Egyptian resort town of Taba, near the border with Israel. The blast, which Egyptian authorities have not explained, wounded six people. Our armed forces launched a large batch of ballistic missiles and a large number of drones at various targets of the Israeli enemy, Houthi military spokesman Brig. Gen. Yahya Saree said in a televised statement. The Yemeni Armed Forces confirm that this operation is the third operation in support of our oppressed brothers in Palestine and confirm that we will continue to carry out more qualitative strikes with missiles and drones until the Israeli aggression stops. For Israel, Tuesdays attack marked an incredibly rare reported in-combat use of the Arrow missile defense system, which intercepts long-range ballistic missiles with a warhead designed to destroy targets while they are in space, according to the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies. All aerial threats were intercepted outside of Israeli territory, the Israeli military said. No infiltrations were identified into Israeli territory. However, the missile fire sparked a rare air raid siren alarm to go off in Eilat, some 250 kilometers (155 miles) south of Jerusalem, sending people fleeing into shelters. Saree did not identify the specific weapons used in the attack. However, the use of the arrow suggests it was a ballistic missile. The Houthis have a variant of its Burkan ballistic missile, modeled after a type of an Iranian missile, believed to be able to reach over 1,000 kilometers (620 miles) to strike near Eilat. The incoming fire comes as the troop-and-aircraft-carrying USS Bataan and other elements of its strike group are likely in the Red Sea now, along with other U.S. vessels. Air Force Brig. Gen. Pat Ryder, the Pentagons press secretary, acknowledged the Houthi fire targeting Israel, suggesting the rebels had missiles able to reach some 2,000 kilometers (1,240 miles). This is something we will continue to monitor, Ryder said. We want to prevent a broader regional conflict. Saudi Arabia also did not respond to questions. The kingdom saw four of its soldiers killed in its southern Jazan province in recent days in fighting with the Houthis, according to a report Tuesday by Bloomberg citing anonymous sources. Thats even as Saudi Arabia has tried for months to reach a peace deal with the Houthis after a yearslong deadlock war against them. The Houthis declaration further drew Iran into the conflict. Tehran has long sponsored both the Houthis and Hamas, as well as the Lebanese Shiite militia group Hezbollah, which continues to trade deadly cross-border fire with the Israelis. U.S. troops also have been targeted in drone attacks on bases in Iraq and Syria claimed by Iranian-allied militia groups since the war started. The Houthis follow the Shiite Zaydi faith, a branch of Shiite Islam that is almost exclusively found in Yemen. The rebels slogan has long been: God is the greatest; death to America; death to Israel; curse the Jews; victory to Islam. But now they have the hard power to back it, said Thomas Juneau, a professor at the University of Ottawa who has studied Yemen for years. It was just a matter of time before they would be able to do this, Juneau said, noting the rebels steadily advancing missile program that came with Iranian assistance. The fact that theres another front directly to the south raises the risk that Israel (air defenses) can be overwhelmed and then it can be that much more worrying if Hezbollah, Hamas and others launch massive missile barrages. Iran has long denied arming the Houthis even as it has been transferring rifles, rocket-propelled grenades, missiles and other weaponry to the Yemeni militia using sea routes. Independent experts, Western nations and United Nations experts have traced components seized aboard other detained vessels back to Iran. The reason for that likely is a U.N. arms embargo that has prohibited weapons transfers to the Houthis since 2014. There also has been at least one attack that the Houthis claimed where suspicion later fell fully on Iran. In 2019, cruise missiles and drones successfully penetrated Saudi Arabia and struck the heart of its oil industry in Abqaiq. That attack temporarily halved the kingdoms production and spiked global energy prices by the biggest percentage since the 1991 Gulf War. While the Houthis claimed the Abqaiq attack, the U.S., Saudi Arabia and analysts blamed Iran. U.N. experts similarly said it was unlikely the Houthis carried out the assault, though Tehran denied being involved. Irans mission to the U.N. warned in a statement to The Associated Press that allied militias like the Houthis could expand their operations against Israel. The warnings from Iran regarding the initial days of the Gaza civilian casualties highlighted a concern: if these atrocities were not halted, they could incite public outrage and exhaust the patience of the resistance movements, the Iranian mission said. These concerns can be averted and the responsibility lies squarely in the hands of the American administration to halt the transgressions perpetuated by the Israeli regime.

        "content": "Indias Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Wednesday (Nov. 01), embarked on a three-day official visit to Sri Lanka. In Kandy, she called on two Buddhist leaders: Chief Prelate of Asgiriya, Most Ven. Warakagoda Sri Gnanarathana Thero, and Chief Prelate of Malwatte, Most Ven. Thibbatuwawe Sri Siddhartha Sumangala Thero. FM Smt. nsitharaman discussed the continued tradition of strong historical and cultural ties between India and Sri Lanka. Most Venerable Warakagoda Sri Gnanarathana acknowledged the cordial relations between the two countries and expressed gratitude for the support from India during the times of economic hardship in Sri Lanka, the Indian Finance Ministry said in a post on X. Sri Lanka was struggling to come out of the financial crisis hit last year, the worst since its independence from Britain in 1948, due to a severe paucity of foreign exchange reserves. As the country struggled and locked in the throes of the crisis, India extended multi-pronged assistance of about 4 billion to it last year through multiple credit lines and currency support, in line with Indias Neighbourhood First policy. During the meeting with the Chief Prelate of Asgiriya and Malwatte, Minister Sitharaman emphasised the continued tradition of friendly relations between India and Sri Lanka. Most Ven. Warakagoda Sri Gnanarathana thanked Sitharaman and India for the assistance for the solar project and indicated that it is a timely and supportive step towards their energy needs. Earlier in the day, she was received by Sri Lankas Minister of Water Supply, Estate Infrastructure Development, Jeevan Thondaman. As part of her official trip, the finance minister will also be present at the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) for solar electrification of religious places in Sri Lanka on Thursday in the presence of Sri Lanka President Ranil Wickremesinghe. For this project, India will allocate 82.40 crore out of the Government of India grant assistance of 107.47 crore earmarked for the promotion of Buddhist ties. On her trip, FM Sitharaman will also give a keynote address at NAAM 200 which marks the 200th anniversary of the arrival of Indian-origin Tamils in Sri Lanka. She will also inaugurate branches of the State Bank of India (SBI) at Trincomalee and Jaffna. While in Sri Lanka, she will also visit Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) oil tank farms in Jaffna, the cultural centre and the Jaffna Public Library. Source: CNBC TV18",

        "content": "The group of 17 Sri Lankans who are trapped in the Gaza Strip amidst the Israel-Hamas conflict have been permitted to leave the war-torn Palestinian enclave and enter Egypt via the Rafah border crossing. Embassy of Sri Lanka in Tel Aviv has communicated this to the Foreign Employment Bureau (SLBFE). On that account, 15 of these Sri Lankans are expected to reach Egypt this afternoon, SLBFE media spokesman Gamini Senarath said joining a special media briefing this morning (Nov. 02). The remaining two are most likely to stay behind in Palestine, he added. Speaking further, Mr. Senarath said the Sri Lankan Embassy in Israel and the Representative Office of Sri Lanka in Palestine are working in tandem to facilitate the safe evacuation of Sri Lankans trapped in Gaza. Injured Palestinians and foreign nationals began arriving in Egypt from Gaza for the first time on Wednesday (Nov. 01) since the Israel-Hamas war started to escalate in early October. According to foreign media, more than 360 foreign nationals on an initial list of over 500, who were trapped in the besieged Gaza, have now entered Egypt through the Rafah border crossing under a Qatar-mediated deal. Passport holders from Australia, Austria, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Finland, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Jordan, the United Kingdom and the United States were evacuated, Reuters reported. Rafah border crossing would reopen today so that more foreigners could exit, Gaza officials have said. Some 7,500 foreign passport holders would leave Gaza over about two weeks, a diplomatic source was quoted as saying. The SLBFE spokesman, citing the Sri Lankan Ambassador to Israel Nimal Bandara, also mentioned that the Sri Lankan man, who remains missing since the surprise attack launched by Hamas earlier this month, is suspected to be among the hostages held by the Islamic militant group. The 48-year-old father of two named Sujith Yatawara Bandara was reported missing after October 07, the day Hamas militants stormed from the blockaded Gaza Strip into nearby Israeli towns to launch an unprecedented attack. The SLBFE spokesman said expeditious measures are being taken to facilitate the immediate release of Bandara.",

        "content": "In a significant development that marks a milestone in Sri Lankas economic and technological journey, the 12th Round of Economic and Technology Cooperation Agreement (ETCA) negotiations between Sri Lanka and India took place from the 30th of October to the 1st of November 2023 in Colombo. Sri Lankas vision has always been to integrate with the largest economies in Asia and East Asia, emphasizing export diversification while maintaining and nurturing existing major export markets. The ultimate goal is to connect with key players through the global value chain to boost the countrys economy and improve the living standards of its people, the Presidents Media Division (PMD) reported. According to the PMD, the discussions during this round of negotiations hold immense promise, with the visit of President Ranil Wickremesinghe on the 29th of July 2023 having set the stage for a renewed commitment to the ETCA, which had been on hold since 2018. Both the Heads of States, representing Sri Lanka and India, agreed to comprehensively enhance bilateral trade and investments, especially in new and priority areas. A delegation of 19 Indian officials, led by Shri Anant Swarup, Chief Negotiator and the Joint Secretary of the Department of Commerce, Ministry of Commerce and Industry of India, visited Sri Lanka. They engaged in extensive discussions on this comprehensive Agreement. Representing Sri Lanka in these crucial negotiations was the National Trade Negotiating Committee (NTNC), headed by Mr. K.J. Weerasinghe, the Chief Negotiator from the Presidential Secretariat. The Sri Lankan Negotiation Team included representatives from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Trade, Commerce and Food Security, Ministry of Industries, Department of Trade  Investment Policy, Attorney Generals Department, Department of Commerce, Department of Agriculture, Central Bank of Sri Lanka and Board of Investment, among others. The discussions during the 12th Round covered a wide range of topics, including Goods, Services, Rules of Origin, Trade remedies, Customs Procedures and Trade Facilitation, Technical Barriers to Trade, Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures and Legal and Institutional Affairs. Additionally, a special session was dedicated to addressing implementation-related issues of the existing India-Sri Lanka Free Trade Agreement (ISFTA). This resumption of ETCA negotiations represents a significant step towards strengthening the economic partnership between Sri Lanka and India. It underlines the commitment of both nations to foster collaboration in various sectors, ultimately benefiting their economies and the well-being of their citizens. As the talks progress, it is anticipated that this agreement will open up new avenues for trade and investment, bringing prosperity to both nations in the ever-evolving global landscape.",

        "content": "An earthquake slightly damaged houses and other buildings in southeastern Indonesia early Thursday, causing some panic but no apparent casualties. The quake was strongly felt in several cities and villages and caused some to panic, said Daryono, who heads the Earthquake and Tsunami Center at Indonesias Meteorology, Climatology and Geophysical Agency. It was based on land and had no risk of a tsunami. The quake has caused light damages in several buildings and houses, wrote Daryono, who goes by a single name, on the social media platform X. Video circulating on social media showed residents in Kupang, the provinces capital and largest city, reacting as houses and buildings swayed just after dawn. Some witnesses said ceilings at the governors and mayors offices were damaged. The U.S. Geological Survey measured the strength at 6.1 magnitude and said the quake occurred 36 kilometers (22 miles) below the surface. The epicenter was 21 kilometers (13 miles) north-northeast of Kupang on the western side of Timor Island. The Indonesian agency measured its strength at 6.3 magnitude. Variations in early measurements of quakes are common. Indonesia is a seismically active archipelago of 270 million people where earthquakes, volcanic eruptions and tsunamis frequently occur. A magnitude 5.6 earthquake last year killed at least 602 people in West Javas Cianjur city. It was the deadliest in Indonesia since a 2018 quake and tsunami in Sulawesi killed more than 4,300 people. In 2004, an extremely powerful Indian Ocean quake set off a tsunami that killed more than 230,000 people in a dozen countries, most of them in Indonesias Aceh province.

As such, former President Maithripala Sirisena, former Defence Secretary Hemasiri Fernando, former Inspector-General of Police (IGP) Pujith Jayasundara and former chief of State Intelligence Service (SIS) Nilantha Jayawardena were instructed to declare their assets and liabilities. The Supreme Court bench gave the order after taking into account the fact that the four respondents failed to pay the total amount of compensation they were required to. Additionally, the judge bench called for a comprehensive report from the Attorney General on the disciplinary action taken against ex-SIS chief Jayawardena before December 30, 2023. On January 12, 2023, the Supreme Court found that former President Sirisena, former Defence Secretary Hemasiri Fernando, former IGP Pujith Jayasundara, former National Intelligence Chief Sisira Mendis and former SIS chief Nilantha Jayawardena had violated the fundamental rights of the people by failing to take action to prevent the Easter Sunday bombings despite receiving sufficient intelligence information. Thus, in its verdict, the judge bench had ordered Sirisena to pay Rs. 100 million in compensation to the petitioners from his personal money, while Pujith Jayasundara and Nilantha Jayawardena were each ordered to pay Rs. 75 million. In addition, Hemasiri Fernando and Sisira Mendis were ordered to pay Rs. 50 million and Rs. 10 million, respectively. The relevant order was delivered by a seven-member Supreme Court Judge bench, with regard to the 12 petitions filed by various parties stating that their fundamental rights were violated by negligence and failure to prevent the coordinated terrorist attacks on April 21, 2019. In July 2023, it was reported that the former president had paid a sum of Rs. 15 million ahead of the deadline, while Hemasiri Fernando, Pujith Jayasundara and Sisira Mendis had paid Rs. 1 million, Rs. 1,725,588 and Rs. 5 million, respectively. Sirisena had also filed a motion requesting that he be allowed to pay the remaining sum in 10 installments of Rs. 8.5 million between June 30, 2024 and June 20, 2033. In the motion filed through his lawyers, Sirisena had explained that he receives a pension of Rs. 97,500 as the former President, along with a sum of Rs. 54,285 for his services as a Member of Parliament. Thus, the former president requested that he be granted a period of 9 years to pay the remainder of the Rs. 100 million.",

        "content": "Sri Lanka players took the field wearing black armbands during the national anthem ceremony of the World Cup 2023 clash against India on November 2. Late Percy Abeysekera, fondly known as Uncle Percy, was a familiar name in the Sri Lankan cricketing circuit. A cricket superfan for over 40 years, he passed away on October 30, aged 87. He shot to fame when Sri Lanka became the world champions for the first time in the 1996 World Cup. The visuals of him marching around the stadium in Lahore with his countrys flag held high to celebrate the victory remain afresh. To pay homage to the departed ardent supporter, the Sri Lankan cricketers decided to don black armbands throughout the match against the hosts in Wankhede, Mumbai. Abeysekera was an integral part of the game of cricket in Sri Lanka and did play a pivotal role from beyond the boundary line to support and motivate the players, SLC tweeted. His towering legacy spans across Sri Lankas pre- and post-test eras, and his name will remain etched forever among cricket lovers. His love for the game didnt go unnoticed as he was admired by cricketers across the globe. In the 1980s, Martin Crowe presented one of his Player of the Match trophies to recognise Uncle Percys passion for the game. Rohit Sharma, who visited Uncle Percy recently during Asia Cup 2023, was deeply saddened by the loss and hailed him as the No.1 supporter. Its a sad loss, you know, sad loss to the cricketing fraternity because in my eyes, he was the No. 1 supporter of cricket at that point in time. Obviously, there have been so many fans now, but the first ever fan, cricket fan I saw was him. So yeah, its a sad moment for all of us, Rohit lamented. Earlier, India against England paid a similar tribute to the late legendary cricketer Bishan Singh Bedi. --With agencies inputs--",

In this context, 300 successful entrepreneurs were recognized and awarded in various categories, including platinum, gold, silver and bronze awards, out of a pool of over 4,000 industrial entrepreneurs who had applied to compete in 21 major industrial sectors and 61 sub-industrial sectors, the PMD said. Expressing his views further President Ranil Wickremesinghe said; As I observed the award recipients today, it brought back memories of the challenges we faced last year. At that time, there were numerous uncertainties about the sustainability of our industries. The absence of electricity and the difficulty in obtaining bank loans had led to the closure of thousands of businesses. Today, its truly remarkable to see a substantial number of individuals reinvigorating their industries and achieving success. Small and medium-scale industries have made a swift comeback in a relatively short period. However, some issues remain unresolved, particularly concerning bank loans and market access. Our foremost priority is to address these concerns. In the upcoming budget, we aim to introduce measures that provide bank loan concessions to support small and medium-scale industries. This program is progressing steadily. We have devised comprehensive strategies to revitalize our nations economy, engaging in discussions with both the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and our creditors. Our primary focus always revolves around our capacity to repay the loans weve taken. To achieve this, we must consistently increase our income year after year. Gaining the trust of private creditors and multilateral creditors is imperative to reassure them of our commitment to loan repayment. This commitment must be ingrained in our actions. A substantial portion of next years budget will be allocated to debt repayment and interest. Failure to meet these obligations could push us back into the old, precarious situation. Therefore, safeguarding our currency and fulfilling our loan obligations is of paramount importance. In the past, when there was a budget shortfall, the solution was to instruct the central bank to print more money. However, this approach is no longer legally permissible and obtaining loans from banks has also become a challenge. These restrictions stem from the informal financial practices of the past. To ensure our financial stability in the coming year, we must significantly boost our income. We have set specific revenue targets that we must work diligently to achieve. Its crucial for the countrys progress and to prevent bankruptcy in the near future. As a result of these financial constraints, we had to make the difficult decision to raise the VAT to 18 yesterday. This step aligns us with the practices of countries like India and Pakistan. Such decisions are never easy for any government. However, failing to take these measures would cast a shadow on everyones future. Therefore, making the right choices becomes imperative. These decisions are necessary for the well-being of the country, even if they draw criticism from the public. Both my cabinet and I have willingly shouldered the responsibility of rebuilding our nation, which had faced economic collapse. We made a deliberate choice not to revert to a state of dependency. Instead, we are committed to moving forward with our own strengths. Regrettably, during a cabinet meeting held last Sunday evening, we had to make this tough decision. While some may point fingers, failing to act would risk returning to the dire circumstances of the previous year. At the start of this year, our economic growth rate was a negative 0.7. Today, it has improved to 0.5, with further progress expected next year. This leaves us with a fundamental choice of whether to advance or regress. This is the essence of leadership  the willingness to make difficult decisions and transparently convey the true state of affairs to the people. Through this decision, we can generate much-needed revenue to support small and medium-scale industries by repaying loans to banks. Without this step, these industries would face collapse, which puts industrialists in a challenging position. Thus, these difficult decisions must be made for the betterment of the country, even if they invite criticism. Our focus should remain on the nations well-being. Regardless, let us embark on this journey with the resolute decision to rebuild our nation. This program offers us the opportunity to transform our country into a prosperous one, no longer dependent on external support. I hold strong belief in the promising future of this nation. We are in negotiations with international financial institutions, including the World Bank and while the path may be challenging today, I am confident that we will reap positive results in the next two or three years. Looking ahead to 2024, I extend my best wishes to all, expressing our shared aspiration to bolster the nations economy further. The event also featured addresses from Minister of Industry and Health, Dr. Ramesh Pathirana, as well as Ministers of State, Prasanna Ranaweera and Chamara Sampath Dasanayake. Notable figures in attendance included Secretary of the Ministry of Industry, Ms Thilaka Jayasundara, Secretary to the Prime Minister, Anura Dissanayake, Chairman of the Ceylon Industrial Development Board, Dr. Saranga Alahapperuma, and various Ministerial Secretaries, heads of government institutions, prominent industrial entrepreneurs and distinguished guests, according to the PMD.",

        "content": "Toxic haze blanketed New Delhi on Thursday, raising fears of another public health emergency in the Indian capital, as government agencies warned that pollution levels could worsen over the next few days despite efforts to reduce them. Air Quality Index (AQI) stood at 415 on a scale of 500 in the capitals Anand Vihar area on Thursday, indicating severe levels of pollution that can affect healthy people and those with existing ailments. AQI between 0-50 is considered healthy. The dip in air quality in the region during the winter months is often accompanied by a spike in respiratory illnesses, spurring school and factory closings. The New Delhi government has announced a ban on the entry of diesel buses and said construction activities will be halted if the situation persists. With AQI levels above 400, New Delhi and Pakistans Lahore on Thursday topped a real-time list of the worlds most polluted cities compiled by Swiss group IQAir. Indias Mumbai also features among the worlds 15 most polluted cities. The worsening air quality has cast a shadow over the cricket World Cup as fans flock to stadiums across Indian cities. AQI in Mumbai hovered around the 200 mark ahead of Thursdays match between India and Sri Lanka. The city is expected to welcome large crowds as it hosts the semifinal of the tournament on Nov. 15. Indias cricket board (BCCI) this week announced a ban on firework displays during the remaining matches of the tournament as a measure to combat pollution. Players have expressed concern about the toxic air, with Englands Joe Root complaining of breathing difficulties during a game and Indias Rohit Sharma urging change for future generations.

        "title": "Political violence in Bangladesh casts dark shadow over upcoming elections",
        "date": "November 2, 2023 04:00 pm",
        "content": "Weeks of mounting political tension have erupted into protests and bloodshed in Bangladesh, leaving the country on edge ahead of general elections due in January. Several senior opposition leaders were arrested last Sunday, a day after a massive rally against the government turned violent, resulting in the deaths of at least two opposition supporters. The rejuvenated main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) has intensified protests calling on Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina to resign. The BNP and its allies want a neutral interim government ahead of the general elections, arguing that free and fair polls are not possible under Ms Hasina. The government led by her Awami League has rejected this demand. The BNP rally in the capital Dhaka attracted tens of thousands of people - one of the biggest gatherings seen there in a decade. But things soon turned violent. Police fired rubber bullets and tear gas while opposition supporters threw stones and bricks. Some roads in the capital were strewn with exploded sound grenades, tear gas shells and broken glass. Both sides accuse each other of starting the violence. The opposition supporters attacked police, journalists, hospitals, ambulances and the houses of the chief justice and other judges, creating chaos, Foreign Minister AK Abdul Momen told the BBC. The BNP said it was the other way round. It was a peaceful and non-violent rally, but the government was baffled by the massive turn out. So, they decided to disrupt the meeting, senior party leader Amir Khasru Mahmud Chowdhury told the BBC. The rally was attacked from two sides. It resembled a war zone. So, we had to stop our public meeting midway. The governing Awami League rejects accusations that their supporters provoked opposition activists taking part in the rally. A three-day nationwide blockade called by the BNP to protest against the police action began on Tuesday. Protesters have set fire to buses and clashed with security forces in several places. Police fired tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse them. Two opposition activists were killed in clashes with police on Tuesday. Most vehicles have stayed off the roads fearing violence. Political unrest is not uncommon in Bangladesh. Over the years parties have taken to the streets to press their demands, resulting in shutdowns, violence and loss of life. But in recent years the political divide has been widening and the bitterness growing, with the Awami League midway through a second decade in office and seeking a fourth straight five-year term. The two main parties are in no mood to compromise and the chances of dialogue ahead of the vote appear slim. Battling Begums The arrested BNP leaders include secretary-general Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir who has led the party since its leader, former prime minister Khaleda Zia, was arrested and jailed in a corruption case five years ago. Shes now 78 and under effective house arrest. Ms Hasina, 76, and Ms Zia, who have dominated Bangladesh politics for more than three decades, are heirs to political dynasties. Both are bitter rivals - locally described as the battling Begums. Begum refers to a Muslim woman of high rank. Ms Hasina came to power for a second time in January 2009 and since then her party has won two more elections, although there have been accusations of widespread vote-rigging. The political unrest ahead of the election is happening at a time when the country is facing economic hardship, with most voters struggling to cope with the escalating cost of living, especially rising food prices. Inflation was around 9.6 in September. The countrys foreign exchange reserves have also dropped from a record 48bn (39.49bn) in August 2021 to around 20bn now - not enough for even three months of imports. Bangladesh was forced to reach out to the International Monetary Fund earlier this year for assistance. Although big opposition rallies in Bangladesh are not unusual, analysts say they are attracting particularly large crowds due to widespread discontent over rising food costs. The economy is on the brink of a disaster and people are suffering. Thats why hundreds of thousands of people are joining our rallies despite attempts by the Awami League to stop them by cancelling transport, carrying out arrests and intimidation, Mr Chowdhury told the BBC. But Ms Hasina, the daughter of the countrys founding father Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, points to the sustained economic growth of the country over the past 15 years under her rule. Clampdown on dissent The arrest of Mr Alamgir, along with hundreds of opposition supporters, after the rally has triggered criticism from rights groups. The intensified crackdown on opposition party leaders and protesters over the weekend signals an attempt at a complete clampdown of dissent in Bangladesh ahead of the general elections in January, Amnesty International said. The Office of the UN Human Rights Commissioner urged the government to show restraint and ensure that human rights were fully upheld for all Bangladeshis. The government has already been accused of carrying out human rights violations on a large scale. The BNP alleges that hundreds of its supporters have become victims of enforced disappearances and extra-judicial killings carried out by the security forces, some of whom have been sanctioned by the US for their actions. The Bangladeshi government has flatly denied charges of abuses and killings - but it also severely restricts visits to foreign journalists who want to investigate these allegations. Definitely, there is a climate of fear, especially while expressing dissent on any kind of digital forum because the government uses the draconian Digital Security Act DSA to imprison people, Shireen Huq, a prominent womens rights activist, told the BBC. Rights groups say the act has been used to silence critics and stifle free expression. They say more than a thousand court cases have been filed against journalists, politicians and activists since it was enacted in 2018. Following widespread opposition, including from the UN, the government recently replaced the DSA with a new Cyber Security Act. But activists say the new law still retains repressive measures. Ms Huq says she has no confidence the government will conduct a free and fair poll in January. The opposition alleges the same, which is why it is demanding a return to installing a neutral caretaker administration ahead of the vote - a safeguard abolished by parliament in 2011. Foreign Minister Momen rejects such calls. There is no history in any country that the sitting government will step down and allow some non-elected people to run the government. We believe in democracy, therefore that type of demand is not acceptable, he told the BBC. The BNP has threatened to boycott the January poll if their demand is not met. This tactic hasnt worked in their favour in the past however. The partys refusal to take part in the December 2014 election helped the Awami League win another landslide. With hardening positions, Bangladeshis are staring at the possibility of protracted political unrest and possibly more street violence. Source: BBC -Agencies",

The said group of Sri Lankans returned to Sri Lanka on October 27, the Sri Lankan Embassy in Amman says. These Sri Lankans had entered Jordan on July 22 on visittourist visas with the anticipation of finding job opportunities. Subsequently, they were arrested by the North Amman police station and detained in correction centers following a decision made by the North Amman Court on October 12. The issue of migrant workers arriving on visittourist visas and overstaying or attempting to cross international borders illegally has been a recurring trend in the past, the Sri Lankan Embassy in Jordanian capital pointed out, adding that since January 2023, it has been actively involved in facilitating the deportation of approximately 120 stranded Sri Lankans, with the support extended by the Jordan authorities. The Embassy said its officials have visited the correction centers to ensure the welfare and safety during their stay. The stranded Sri Lankans have been provided essential humanitarian support including medical assistance and access to necessities by the Jordanian authorities. The Embassy strongly advised Sri Lankans not to arrive in Jordan on visittourist visas without a confirmed job opportunity and required visa. Many male and female Sri Lankans continue to fall prey to human smuggling and are subsequently subjected to deportation after being held in correction centers. It also requested all Sri Lankans to seek overseas job opportunities legally and to register with the Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment (SLBFE) before their departure.",

        "date": "November 2, 2023 08:15 pm",
        "content": "State Minister for Provincial Councils and Local Government, Janaka Wakkambura, announced that a project under the Ministry of Provincial Councils and Local Government will allocate Rs. 09 billion to support the health and education sectors across all nine provinces. Additionally, he informed that 8,400 non-permanent employees working in local government agencies under the Provincial Councils will transition to permanent government service pending cabinet approval. These remarks were made by State Minister Janaka Wakkambura during a press conference at the Presidential Media Centre today (02), held under the theme Collective path to a stable country. Expressing his views further State Minister Janaka Wakkumbura said; The use of GIS and GPS Mapping technology enables us to capture the coordinates of all the roads within local government jurisdictions, facilitating the creation of a comprehensive road inventory in accordance with the Local Government Act of 1987No. This system has already been successfully implemented in the North Western Province. A Cabinet paper was submitted and approved on the 09th of October marking a significant step towards extending this method to cover all provinces. Remarkably, we have managed to accomplish road mapping that eluded completion for 36 years, within a relatively brief span of one and a half years. Notably, the North Central and Northern Provinces have made substantial progress in identifying roads and mapping their coordinates. We have set a target to complete this work in these two provinces by the 31st of December this year. Subsequently, a timeline will be established for the remaining six provinces, along with training initiatives to achieve our goals in 2024. In addition to our mapping efforts, we are actively engaged in a project supported by the World Bank through our ministry. This project allocates Rs. 09 billion to enhance the health and education sectors across all nine provinces. Out of this amount, Rs. 4,500 million will be dedicated to improving healthcare services. By the end of June next year, we aim to address the health-related issues in the respective provinces. Furthermore, we are committed to providing another Rs. 4,500 million to address deficiencies in schools across these provinces. This project is slated to commence in January and is expected to be completed within a six-month timeframe. Additionally, we have a plan to transition 8,400 non-permanent employees currently working in local government agencies under the provincial councils into permanent government service once the cabinet grants approval. These dedicated individuals have served for approximately 15 years. With a vacancy of 10,000 positions within the provincial councils, over 6,000 have already been designated as multi-purpose workers. By the 10th of this month, we are actively working to fill the remaining vacancies with multi-purpose development officers.

        "date": "November 2, 2023 10:21 pm",
        "content": "The United States on Thursday imposed sweeping new measures against Moscow over the war in Ukraine, targeting Russias future energy capabilities, sanctions evasion and a suicide drone that has been a menace to Ukrainian troops and equipment, among others, in sanctions on hundreds of people and entities. The latest measures target a major entity involved in the development, operation and ownership of a massive project in Siberia known as Arctic-2 LNG, the State Department said in a statement. The project expected to ship chilled natural gas, known as liquefied natural gas to global markets. Washington also targeted the KUB-BLA and Lancet suicide drones being used by the Russian military in Ukraine, designating a network it accused of procuring items in support of their production as well as the creator and designer of the drones. The Biden administration on Thursday added a dozen Russian companies to a trade blacklist for supporting Russias military with drones that could be used to aid in Moscows invasion of Ukraine, the Commerce Department said in a statement. The U.S. also cracked down on sanctions evasion in the United Arab Emirates, Turkey and China, as the Treasury Department said companies based in the countries continue to send high priority dual-use goods to Russia, including components Moscow relies on for its weapons systems. Seven Russia-based banks and dozens of industrial firms were also hit with sanctions by the Treasury Department, including Gazpromneft Catalytic Systems LLC, which Treasury said manufactures chemical agents for advanced oil refining in Russia.",
