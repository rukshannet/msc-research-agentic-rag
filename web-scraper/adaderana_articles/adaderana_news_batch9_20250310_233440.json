        "title": "Alec Baldwin charged with involuntary manslaughter in film set shooting",
        "date": "February 1, 2023 02:03 pm",
        "content": "Alec Baldwin was on the phone during firearms training for a movie where he fatally shot a cinematographer on set, prosecutors said, as they charged him with involuntary manslaughter. Santa Fes District Attorneys Office accused the actor of many instances of extremely reckless acts. Halyna Hutchins died on the set of Rust in New Mexico after Mr Baldwin allegedly fired a prop gun. The films armourer has also been charged with involuntary manslaughter. The documents released on Tuesday detailing the charges - first announced on 19 January - portray a chaotic set with a reckless approach to gun safety. Mr Baldwin was distracted talking to family members on his mobile phone during training on how to operate the prop gun, Robert Shilling, a special investigator for the district attorneys office, wrote in a statement of probable cause filed with the manslaughter charges. If Mr Baldwin had performed mandatory safety checks with armourer Hannah Gutierrez-Reed and not pointed the gun at Hutchins, the tragedy would not have occurred, Mr Shilling argued. This reckless deviation from known standards and practice and protocol directly caused the fatal shooting, he said. Baldwin knew the first rule of gun safety is never point a gun at someone you dont intend on shooting, Mr Shilling added. The charging document outlines at least a dozen acts or omissions of recklessness leading up to the shooting, including:  Not using a replica firearm for an unscheduled rehearsal  Letting the armourer leave the set against protocol  Deviating from the practice of only receiving the gun from the armourer  Not dealing with safety complaints on set  Not performing required safety checks with the armourer, who was hired without adequate certification Lawyers for Mr Baldwin and Ms Gutierrez-Reed have said they intend to fight the charges in court. If found guilty, Mr Baldwin and Ms Gutierrez-Reed could face up to 18 months in prison and a 5,000 (4,050) fine. They will be tried by a jury, according to prosecutors. Ms Hutchins died in hospital after she was shot in the chest by a prop gun allegedly fired by Mr Baldwin during a rehearsal at Bonanza Creek Ranch near Santa Fe. Mr Baldwin has previously denied responsibility for the shooting. He argued in media interviews that he did not pull the trigger on the gun and that it had just gone off, prosecutors alleged. But photos and videos from the Rust shooting depict Mr Baldwin practising drawing and firing the weapon with his finger inside the trigger guard and on the trigger multiple times, prosecutors said. In addition, officials with the FBI found the gun could not be fired without pulling the trigger, according to a report the agency sent to the Santa Fe County Sherriffs Office. The 30 Rock actor has filed a lawsuit against Ms Gutierrez-Reed and other people involved with the film, alleging they failed to check the gun carefully. Ms Gutierrez-Reed has said she had checked that the rounds she loaded in the prop gun were dummies before it was handed to the films assistant director Dave Halls, who then handed it to Mr Baldwin and told him it was an unloaded gun. An initial investigation into the incident found there was a degree of neglect, and producers were fined more than 136,000 by the New Mexico Environment Department for failing to enforce safety protocols. Mr Halls has entered a guilty plea to a misdemeanour charge of negligent use of a deadly weapon, prosecutors said. He will spend six months serving probation. A lawyer for Ms Gutierrez-Reed said she will fight these charges and blamed Mr Halls for not letting her know that a real gun was to be used in the moment when the fatal shooting occurred. Hannah asked Halls if they could use a plastic gun for the rehearsal scene and he said no, wanting a real gun, her lawyer, Todd Bullion, said in a statement. Hannah asked to be called back into the church if Baldwin was going to use the gun at all and Halls failed to do that. A representative for Mr Baldwin declined to comment to the BBC on Tuesday.

The relevant petition was filed by CTUs General Secretary, Joseph Stalin, with the Secretary to the Ministry of Power and Energy, the Chairman of the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB), Chairman of the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) and the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka being named amongst the respondents. The petitioners claimed that although a settlement was reached between the relevant parties before the HRCSL that an uninterrupted supply of power will be provided during the period in which the 2022 GCE Advanced Level examination is being held, the aforementioned parties failed to abide by the settlement, which, in turn, resulted to the violation of the basic fundamental rights of those students sitting for the exam. The petition further stated that the implementation of such power cuts have also caused a great disadvantage to the students. Thus, in their petition, CTU called for an order to be issued against the respondents, preventing the implementation of power cuts during the period in which any national exams are being held. They also requested the Supreme Court that an investigation be conducted into this matter. Meanwhile, the HRCSL too, filed a case of Contempt of Court against the Secretary to the Ministry of Power and Energy, CEB Chairman and the Chairman of CPC, on account that they failed to abide by the agreement reached pertaining to the uninterrupted supply of electricity during the 2022 GCE Advanced Level examination, which commenced on 23 January, and is expected to go on until 17 February. Issuing a statement, the commission stated that in the aforesaid circumstances in particular the Chairman of the CEB is guilty of the offence of contempt under the provisions of the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka Act No. 21 of 1996. The Commission alleges that by notwithstanding the settlement arrived by the above parties to provide uninterrupted electricity for the AL students during the period of the examination, the CEB willfully and maliciously disregarded the settlement and continued with the power cuts.",

        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe emphasized that although lives lost during the war cannot be regained, the income lost during the economic war could be regained. The President also pointed out that the stability of political and territorial integrity of a country is the best factor to win over the economic war. President Ranil Wickremesinghe made this statement while addressing the ceremony held today (01) at the Presidential Palace in Kandy to present the distinguished service awards Vishishta Seva Vibhushana to 77 senior officers of the Tri-Forces (Army, Navy, Air Force). The award ceremony was organized in conjunction with the 75th Independence Day celebrations, the Presidents Media Division said. The Vishishta Seva Vibhushana is a unique award and is awarded only to officers of the rank of Lieutenant Colonel and above in the Army and officers holding similar ranks in the Navy and Air Force who have served at least 25 years of continuous service and holds an unblemished a service record. In relation to the years 2019, 2020, 2021, 53 Army officers, 17 Navy officers and 7 Air Force officers were awarded medals during todays ceremony. The President also presented the 75th Independence Anniversary Commemorative Medals to 20 Tri-Forces personnel. Expressing his views at the ceremony, President Ranil Wickremesinghe said, Today we have awarded the Vishishta Seva Vibhushana awards to those who deserve this Medal. Also, these service awards were given on the occasion of the 75th Independence Anniversary. I congratulate all the recipients of these medals today. I also extend my appreciation for your service. This event is the first event to be held to mark the 75th Anniversary of Sri Lankas Independence. There is a reason to hold this event for the armed forces. National leaders of the past, led by the Hon. D.S. Senanayake gained freedom for our country. Today, some act as though the country automatically gained independence. Freedom was not gained automatically. There were 2 countries that supported the Allies in Asia during World War II. One was China and the other was Sri Lanka. But, only Sri Lanka had a legislature which was elected by franchise. After appreciating the support given for the Second World War by the former leader of the council Mr. D.B. Jayathilika and afterwards Hon. D.S. Senanayake, the British Prime Minister Mr. Winston Churchill said that Sri Lanka would be given freedom after the war on one condition, that India were given freedom first. That is how we got this freedom. During World War II, the Council of State decided to support the allied countries. In addition, Sri Lankan officials volunteered to support World War II. Mr.D.S. Senanayake appreciated the release and formed three armed forces from those troops. If we supported the Second World War and gained independence, we should also honour the service of our three armed forces during this anniversary celebration. For the safety of the nation, members of our security forces gave their lives in battle. Our Army was founded during a world war. It protected democracy over the world. The second war was to preserve Sri Lankas unity and territorial integrity. Our armed forces sacrificed their lives for that. We should keep in mind this outstanding contribution performed by our armed forces as we commemorate the nations independence as a republic. Therefore, I made the decision to host the first ceremonial event in connection with the 75th Independence Day for the Armed Forces. Our three armed forces are now not only in Sri Lanka they serve as a UN peacekeepers as well. In the future, we intend to increase the number of recruits for this peacekeeping force. We commemorated our 50th anniversary of independence while the nation was at war. We are commemorating our 75th Independence Day at a time when there is another conflict. It is not a battle in which we individually take a weapon and engage in combat. A significant economic battle is currently underway. The countrys economy has now totally collapsed. Our nations economic freedom will vanish if we dont rebuild that economy and rescue ourselves from this debt trap. If the economic freedom of the country is lost, political freedom is of no use. We cannot surrender to the economic powers of the world today. Building this economy should therefore be our priority. Make means for the people to live, and revive their lost sources of income. I am aware of the fact that many people are facing difficulties today. Some government employees are facing a situation where nothing of their salaries is spared after settling their loan installments and taxes. We all bear this pressure and we will be able to get rid of this pressure. I met the U.S. Under-Secretary for Political Affairs, Victoria Nuland today. She further expressed the US Governments support for the ongoing recovery efforts in our country. Hence we have been expressed support by many countries. I believe that during the next two to three months, we would be able to complete this debt restructuring process. The dialogues with India and China have reached the final stage. When we reach the agreement for debt restructuring from the International Monetary Fund, it would be accepted by the rest of the world. I believe that we would have a better economic situation by the end of this year. At the same time, we would get an opportunity to provide some relief to all government employees. We must drive this program forward and we are not in a position to get out of it. If we are on the right path, we have to be strategic and only then victory could be achieved. There is only one difference between terrorist war and economic war. Lives were lost those days during the terrorist war. Today we have lost the income. Thats the only difference. We cannot give a new life to those who lost but the lost income can be recovered. As a government, we are all committed to reviving it under this program. I believe that we can move forward reviving the economic freedom along with the political freedom back then we won while protecting the territorial integrity.

The Mahaweli Authority of Sri Lanka today stated that they are no longer able to release adequate volumes of water from reservoirs for the uninterrupted supply of electricity. Accordingly, the Deputy Director General of the Mahaweli Authority explained that although heavy rains were expected in the Mahaweli river basins both yesterday (31 Jan.) and today, these rains are currently moving towards the Northern Province, thus, they are unable to provide sufficient volumes of water for the uninterrupted supply of electricity as they did for the last two days. Thus, only those volumes of water required for the usual generation of electricity, with the scheduled power cuts in effect, can be supplied. Adequate water to generate power without any interruptions was released on 30 and 31 January, following a request made in this regard by the Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL), owing to which, no power cuts were imposed during the aforementioned days.",

This was discussed at length during a meeting between the Ambassador of France to Sri Lanka, Jean-François Pactet and Public Security Minister Tiran Alles on Wednesday (Feb. 01). Reiterating the support of France to boost the bilateral relations between the two nations, Pactet said France stands determined to disrupt the operations of traffickers. Taking to Twitter, Pactet said the meeting helped identify new opportunities to broaden Sri Lanka-French partnership. The meeting took place days after 38 Sri Lankans were repatriated by the authorities of the Réunion Island of France on January 25 after an illegal migration attempt via sea routes was foiled on January 14. The smugglers, identified as residents of Kalpitiya and Kandy, are believed to have charged sums ranging from Rs. 400,000 to Rs. 1 million per person, Sri Lanka Navy reported. Meanwhile, another group of illegal migrants, which comprised 46 Sri Lankans, were repatriated by French authorities on January 13 after an unsuccessful illegal migration attempt.

Kananathan said Sri Lanka, a country in South Asia, was committed to supporting the Kenyan government in its quest of creating jobs for citizens in a bid of solving the challenge of unemployment in the country. Our brothers and sisters from Sri Lanka have done an amazing job setting up factories in the Export Processing Zone (EPZ). Sri Lanka companies have employed 20, 000 Kenyans at the zone and they are expanding, Kananathan said. He spoke when he officiated the launching of the one million tree planting exercise initiative at EPZ, Athi River in Machakos County on February 1. The convoy said 100,000 trees will be planted in the zone, while 900, 000 others will be planted in the Karura forest. The trees were donated to the Kenyan government by three Sri Lankan companies located in the zone. The three companies are the first ones in EPZ to take the challenge given by President William Ruto to plant trees so as to improve the environment. So, we must commend and thank them for the initiative that they have taken, Kananathan said. They have started today with 100,000 trees and they are giving out a further 900, 000 trees to be planted in Karura forest, he said. Kananathan said the initiative was in line with the Kenyan presidents nationwide campaign to plant 15 billion trees by the end of 2032. So, we want to support the Sri Lankan community in Kenya. We want to support this initiative to make EPZ green and increase forest cover, Kananathan said. He said the Sri Lankan investors at the zone had pledged to donate the trees in one to two weeks time. Kananathan said the good business environment at EPZ had attracted Sri Lanka investors to Kenya. He said there was good infrastructure development and a young, skilled and highly educated Kenyan workforce that investors from Sri Lanka find beneficial to their investments at EPZ and generally in the country. The envoy said Sri Lanka was also collaborating with the Kenyan government to improve the coffee industry. He said they were committed to improving the quality and quantity of coffee that was being exported from Kenya to the global market. This he said was intended to improve the countrys economy and the livelihoods of the coffee farmers. EPZA Board Chairman Ben Oluoch Olunya lauded Sri Lanka for its investors continuous support to help the Kenyan government find jobs for the unemployed populace. Olunya affirmed that more than 40,000 Kenyans had been employed by investors from Sri Lanka across the country. He said EPZ had a population of over 70,000 employees currently. There are investors from other parts of the world who have invested at the EPZ, Olunya said. He said the EPZ program was good and one of the presidents key cornerstones in the countrys development and employment. Source: The Star",

The case was called before the Supreme Court judge bench comprising Preethi Padman Surasena, Yasantha Kodagoda and Shiran Gunaratne this morning. The rights group had filed a contempt case against the Power  Energy Ministrys secretary, CEB chairman and the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) chairman, over their failure to abide by the agreement reached at a recent meeting to provide an uninterrupted supply of power while the Advanced Level examination is taking place from January 23 to February 17. During todays court proceedings, the legal counsels representing the CEB requested the judge bench to fix the case for support tomorrow, stating that they require more time to consult their client. However, Justice Kodagoda raised concerns about deferring the case, noting that it is a matter of urgency. Accordingly, the defence counsels were allowed to briefly consult their client before the case was called before the judge bench again this afternoon. Lodging the case, the HRCSL had stated that the CEB chairman is guilty of the offence of contempt under the provisions of the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka Act No. 21 of 1996. The HRCSL alleged that notwithstanding the settlement arrived by the above parties to provide uninterrupted electricity for the AL exam candidates during the period of the examination, the CEB willfully and maliciously disregarded the settlement and continued with the power cuts.

        "date": "February 2, 2023 01:05 pm",
        "content": "The Chief Prelates of the Three Chapters have accused President Ranil Wickremesinghe of confusing the country following his statement on the implementation of the 13th Amendment. In a letter addressed to the Head of State today (02 Feb.), the religious leaders deemed the 13th Amendment as a piece of legislation that gives rise to serious concerns pertaining to the countrys national security, territorial integrity and its independence. They further noted that by implementing the 13th Amendment, police and land powers too, will be devolved to Provincial Councils, and thus asserted that the Amendment should not be enforced at all. Last month, President Wickremesinghe expressed the Cabinets willingness pertaining to the full implementation of the 13th Amendment. Accordingly, he stated that the 13th Amendment will be implemented, in full, unless it is decided by the Party Leaders as to whether or not the Amendment should be abolished. Attached below is the relevant letter received by Wickremesinghe from the Chief Prelates;",

        "title": "UK hit by biggest strike action in more than a decade",
        "date": "February 2, 2023 01:55 pm",
        "content": "Tens of thousands of school teachers, university staff and lecturers, train drivers, and civil servants are among the workers walking out as part of Wednesdays nationwide strike in the UK. Such widespread strike action has not taken place since a previous pay dispute back in 2011 when more than a million workers walked out. The National Education Union says around 300,000 teachers across England alone are striking as they have experienced at least 23 real-term pay cuts since 2010. Like many others in different sectors, teachers are also demanding an increase above the soaring double-digit inflation rate in the country. While a majority of schools are either fully or partially closed, travel is also disrupted with workers setting up picket lines and rallies. Around 100,000 civil servants from 124 public departments have also joined the strike. Major travel disruptions across UK, queues at airports Workers of 15 train companies are also staging a walkout on Wednesday, which will be followed by another strike on Friday. The industrial action has been organized by the Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen (ASLEF) union, which represents 96 of train drivers in England, Scotland, and Wales. Border Force operations are also affected, with delays reported for international arrivals at all UK air and maritime ports, as well as at UK border controls in France. Wednesdays strike is the second walkout by the Border Force staff after the Christmas season when military personnel was called in to take over their duties. The Public and Commercial Services Union (PCS) also announced that 1,000 staff will be staging walkouts from Feb. 17 to Feb. 20 across ports located in northern France: Dover, Calais, Coquelles, and Dunkirk. In a statement, PCS General Secretary Mark Serwotka said the planned strikes will impact people returning from holidays, but said the blame  lies firmly at the feet of ministers who are refusing to put any money on the table. Anti-strike bill protests across UK The Trades Union Congress (TUC), which represents all the unions in the country, has announced rallies across the UK for Wednesday. Most of those who are on strike was expected to join nationwide demonstrations where workers protest against the governments anti-strike legislation that was passed in the lower house of parliament on Tuesday. The bill imposes restrictions on industrial actions in certain sectors, as the government says it supports the right to strike but also wants to take into account the interests of the public. Members of the opposition who object to minimum safety levels, well, theyll need to explain to their constituents why it is that if you have a heart attack, a stroke, or life-threatening illness on a strike day there are no minimum safety standards in place, British Business Secretary Grant Shapps said while defending the new legislation, which looks into six key sectors including health, education, fire, rescue, transport, border security, and nuclear decommissioning. TUC General Secretary Paul Nowak says the legislation will prolong disputes and poison industrial relations, leading to more frequent strikes. Refusing to work on the day of a strike could result in a worker to be sacked, according to the new law. Thats undemocratic, unworkable, and almost certainly illegal, Nowak said. Fire Brigades Union General Secretary Matt Wrack called the bill a shameful attack on democratic rights. This is an attack on all workers, including key workers, who kept our public services going during the pandemic. Its an attack on Britains COVID heroes and on all workers. We need a mass movement of resistance to this authoritarian attack, he said.",

        "content": "Indias central bank has asked local banks for details of their exposure to the Adani group of companies, government and banking sources said on Thursday. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The sources declined to be identified because they were not authorised to speak to the media. Shares in Adani group of companies plunged on Thursday after the conglomerate, led by tycoon Gautam Adani, shelved a 2.5 billion share sale amid a turbulent market, citing the need to insulate investors from potential losses. Information being sought by the RBI includes details of collateral being used to back loans and any indirect exposure banks may have, one of the sources said. The Indian banking sectors direct exposure to the Adani group was just 0.6, Societe Generale said in a report on Wednesday. It said markets are overpricing the risk to Indian lenders of their exposure to the Adani Group and that a selloff in banking shares seemed overdone. Source - Reuters -Agencies",

This year, the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) has announced the theme for World Wetlands Day as Its Time for Wetlands Restoration, which highlights the urgent need to prioritize wetland restoration. Meanwhile, the Director of Protected Area Management of the Department of Wildlife Conservation Manjula Amararatne said that several programs have been organized across Sri Lanka coinciding with World Wetlands Day. He pointed out that several programs have been launched by the Wildlife Conservation Department together with the Forest Conservation Department, in order to protect and restore mangroves, which are an especially important wetland ecosystem. The Wildlife Conservation Department is currently restoring an area that has been degraded due to shrimp farming in the Anawilundawa sanctuary in a very scientific manner, he added. World Wetlands Day also marks the date of the adoption of Convention on Wetlands on February 02, 1971, in the Iranian city of Ramsar. Nearly 90 of the worlds wetlands have been degraded since the 1700s, and the wetlands are being lost three times faster than forests, the UNEP noted, issuing a statement with regard to World Wetlands Day 2023. Yet, wetlands are critically important ecosystems that contribute to biodiversity, climate mitigation and adaptation, freshwater availability, world economies, and more, it added. It is urgent that we raise national and global awareness about wetlands in order to reverse their rapid loss and encourage actions to conserve and restore them, according to the UNEP. However, the UNEP also highlighted that World Wetlands Day is the ideal time to increase peoples understanding of these critically important ecosystems, adding that Wetlands ecological services contribute 47.4 trillion annually to human health, happiness, and security.",

        "content": "(Reuters) - The Paris Club of creditor nations is ready to provide financing assurances to Sri Lanka, a key step needed to unlock a 2.9 billion International Monetary Fund bailout, two sources with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters. The group of bilateral lenders is set to soon announce its support to the crisis-hit nation on a debt overhaul, said one of the people, who asked not to be named because talks are private. Sri Lanka entered into a staff level agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) last September, but needs financing assurances from key bilateral lenders before the funds executive board approves the programme. China and India, both not permanent Paris Club members, are top bilateral lenders to the crisis-hit country. India previously committed to help ease the debt burden of neighbour Sri Lanka as part of the IMF programme, while Chinas Eximbank offered a two-year moratorium in a letter sent to the island nation in January. While the IMF has not yet provided any guidance on where the lender stands regarding Chinas assurances to Sri Lanka, a U.S. official visiting Colombo said on Wednesday that Beijing has not done enough. What China has offered so far is not enough. We need to see credible and specific assurances that they will meet the IMF standard of debt relief, U.S. Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs Victoria Nuland told reporters.

        "date": "February 2, 2023 06:04 pm",
        "content": "A member of the US Senate Intelligence Committee is calling on Apple and Google to remove TikTok from their app stores over concerns about national security, in the latest indication of mounting scrutiny on the short-form video app from members of Congress. In a letter sent to the two tech giants on Thursday, Colorado Democratic Sen. Michael Bennet calls TikTok an unacceptable threat to the national security of the United States and cites the same concerns that have prompted the federal government and more than half of US states to restrict TikTok from official devices and networks. Writing to Apple CEO Tim Cook and Google CEO Sundar Pichai, Bennet highlighted fears that China could use its national security laws to force TikTok or its parent, ByteDance, to hand over the personal information of the apps US users. The laws in question, Bennet wrote, require organizations in the country to cooperate with state intelligence work and to allow the government to access company resources. ByteDances founder is Chinese and the company has offices in China. TikTok has also disclosed to European users that their data may be accessed by employees based in China. China could potentially try to shape what US users see on the app, Bennet warned, with possible implications for foreign policy and democracy. We should accept the very real possibility that China could compel TikTok, via ByteDance, to use its influence to advance Chinese government interests, Bennet wrote, for example, by tweaking its algorithm to present Americans content to undermine U.S. democratic institutions or muffle criticisms of Chinas handling of Hong Kong, Taiwan or ethnic minorities. Apple, Google and TikTok didnt immediately respond to a request for comment. TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew is expected to testify before a House committee in March to discuss the companys data security practices. There is no evidence that the type of spying or manipulation US officials fear has actually occurred, but security experts have warned that it is a possibility. TikTok has denied that it would ever hand over US user data to the Chinese government. It has increasingly moved to wall off its US operations from the rest of its business, technologically and organizationally  part of what the company has described as a good-faith effort to address the national security concerns. TikTok has also spent years negotiating a potential national security deal with the US government that would seek to resolve some of the concerns, but the talks have been mired by delays, leading to frustration among some members of Congress. In recent months, multiple US lawmakers have introduced bills that would ban TikTok from all US devices, including personal ones. Some other US officials have also called on Apple and Google to voluntarily remove TikTok from their app stores. Last year, Brendan Carr, a commissioner at the Federal Communications Commission, wrote a letter to the companies urging them to de-list TikTok. The FCC does not regulate app stores, but Carr has said that his agencys experience dealing with Chinese telecom companies has informed his views on the matter. The FCC has moved to block Chinese firms including Huawei and ZTE from the US market, over fears that their wireless networking equipment could be used to collect information on US communications. Although the leading members of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Virginia Democrat Mark Warner and Florida Republican Marco Rubio, have also been outspoken critics of TikTok, the two lawmakers had not been invited to co-sign Bennets letter before it was sent, according to a spokesperson for Bennet. Rubio is an author of one of the bills seeking to ban TikTok from the United States, while Warner has said he would prefer to see a bill that targets a broader category of worrisome apps, rather than a single app such as TikTok. - CNN - Agencies",

        "title": "IMF rejects Pakistans debt-management strategy, calls it unrealistic",
        "date": "February 2, 2023 11:10 pm",
        "content": "The visiting IMF review mission has rejected Pakistans revised Circular Debt Management Plan (CDMP) and asked the government to raise the electricity tariff by PKR 12.50 per unit in order to restrict the additional subsidy at PKR 335 billion for the current fiscal year. The IMF has termed the revised CDMP as unrealistic, which is based on certain wrong assumptions. So the government will have to bring more changes in its policy prescription to restrict the losses of the cash-bleeding power sector. The IMF and Ministry of Finance will work out a gap on the fiscal front after which different additional taxation measures will be finalised through the upcoming mini-budget. The revised CDMP envisages an increase in the monster of circular debt to the tune of PKR 952 billion for the current fiscal year against an earlier projection of PKR 1,526 billion. The Pakistani government shared its revised CDMP with the IMF high-ups on Wednesday, which shows the government required an additional subsidy of PKR 675 billion despite raising the power tariff in the range of Rs7 per unit through quarterly tariff adjustment in the first two quarters of 2023 and PKR 1.64 for the third quarter from June to August. The IMF has opposed the certain basis of the revised CDMP and asks the government to raise the tariff in the range of PKR 11 to PKR 12.50 per unit, so that the requirement of additional subsidy could be reduced to half from its existing levels of PKR 675 billion for the current fiscal year, said the top official sources. The IMF also raised questions on how the government calculated its additional subsidy requirement figure of PKR 675 billion for the current fiscal year. The government has understated the exchange rate for calculating the revised CDMP, so with the existing rate the plan would be changed. The revised CDMP seeks to restrict losses of DISCOs to 16.27 percent on average during the current fiscal year. The government envisaged the target to recover Fuel Price Adjustment (FPA) charges deferred last summer to fetch PKR 20 billion into the kitty against estimates of PKR 65 billion made on the eve of the last summer. The markup saving due to IPPs stock payment will bring PKR 11 billion. The GST and other taxes on a collection basis will help recover PKR 18 billion in the current fiscal year. The circular debt is estimated to hover around PKR 2,113 billion till the end of FY2023, including the amount parked in the Power Holding Limited (PHL), PKR 765 billion and PKR 1,248 billion payables to power producers and PKR 100 billion to fuel suppliers. On the fiscal front, the government shared its plan for unveiling a mini-budget through Presidential Ordinance. The FBR has proposed Flood Levy from 1 to 3 percent, imposing another levy to deduct 65pc to 70pc tax from lofty profits earned by the banking sector through exchange rate manipulation and hiking rates of certain withholding taxes. The IMF has discussed the possibility of providing an adjuster for flood expenditure but asked the government to take the decision on qualitative taxation measures to bring the primary deficit to make it surplus at a level of 0.2 percent of GDP equivalent to PKR 153 billion for the current financial year. Talking to journalists, Minister of State for Finance Aisha Ghaus Pasha said that the cost of power generation was on the higher side while the recovery was less, so the bottom point was crystal clear that the country now could not afford subsidy. She said the government would not put the burden on common consumers as much as possible but the elite and affluent class would have to contribute by paying the full cost of electricity generation. She said the Power Division presented its plan to tackle the circular debt. Pakistan and the IMF will continue technical-level of talks in the next couple of days and then afterwards the policy levels will be held to finalise the Memorandum of Financial and Economic Policies (MEFP) document next week, she concluded.

        "date": "February 3, 2023 08:59 am",
        "content": "UNICEF says its revised Humanitarian Needs and Priorities (HNP) plan has estimated that 7 million people in Sri Lanka are in need of humanitarian assistance due to the economic crisis. In its latest situation report on Sri Lankas economic crisis (for the period from January 01, 2022, to December 31, 2022), UNICEF noted that essential services for children such as health, nutrition, and education have been severely impacted by shortages of medicine, food insecurity, lack of fuel and long power cuts. In June 2022, UN agencies had estimated that 1.7 million out of the 22 million population in the country required help. Later in November 2022, this figure doubled to 3.4 million. Since June last year, the UN team in Sri Lanka and NGOs have used the HNP to respond to the Sri Lankan governments request for more support to alleviate the impact of the countrys debt and food crisis, and shortages of medicines. Generous contributions from bilateral, public and private donors have helped the humanitarian community reach over one million of the countrys most vulnerable with cash, food, school meals, medicine, protection, and livelihood support. According to the report, UNICEF has reached over 1.3 million people, including 750,000 children with humanitarian assistance in 2022 through humanitarian interventions during this period. Through UNICEF interventions, over 800,000 people in urban areas have access to safe drinking water, 285,403 children in rural and estate areas were provided with educational materials, and 205,000 adolescents benefitted from mental health and psychosocial support services in communities and in schools. UNICEF piloted humanitarian cash transfers reached 3,010 mothers with young children for three months in Colombo municipal area in 2022, which is being further scaled up to reach 110,000 motherscaregivers in 2023. The UNICEF says it had appealed for USD 25 million to provide timely life-saving humanitarian services to nearly 2.8 million people, including 1.7 million children affected by the crisis situation. Of the USD 25 million funding ask, UNICEF has received USD 34 million, the UN agency said highlighting the uneven distribution of funding received. Some sectors, notably education and child protection, remain significantly underfunded, while others (nutrition and social protection) have received triple the ask. This situation highlights the need for fresh funding into 2023, particularly for the underfunded sectors. On June 10, 2022, aligned with the UN inter-agency HNP appeal for Sri Lanka, the UNICEF Sri Lanka Country Office launched its Humanitarian Action for Children (HAC), receiving generous contributions from bilateral, public and private donors such as Japan, Australia, New Zealand, Norway, Canada, Switzerland, USAID, the Central Emergency Response Fund, UNICEF USA, Foreign Commonwealth and Development Office (UK) and Global Thematic Humanitarian Funds. The UNICEF report says the need for continued funding to sustain prevailing humanitarian needs post-HNP is critical although the HNP expired in December 2022.

        "content": "The Sri Lankabhimanya Award, deemed the most prestigious lifetime award in the country, was conferred on Parliamentarian Deshabandu Karu Jayasuriya by President Ranil Wickremesinghe a short while ago (03 Feb.). The former Speaker received the award at a Ceremony of Investiture held at the Presidents House in Colombo this morning, the Presidents Media Division (PMD) reported. The decision to award the accolade was announced in a special gazette notification published on 24 January. Sri Lankabhimanya is the highest civil honour of Sri Lanka awarded by the President on behalf of the government. It is bestowed upon those who have rendered exceptionally outstanding and most distinguished service to the nation. Only five Sri Lankans can hold this honor at the same time, which means that if five recipients of the award are alive, the award cannot be given to a sixth person. However, the award can also be given posthumously. Addressing the ceremony, Karu Jayasuriya said that what should be done at this point of time is not the struggle of racism, but to work to create national harmony. He also requested all parties and opposition parties to join hands to ensure that the next generation would be handed over a glorious country having rectified the shortcomings that have occurred over the past 75 years. Jayasuriya pointed out that at no time in his political career had he criticized or offended anyone and said that he had never engaged in any illegal activities. He said that as a result of an effort to create a new political culture, on the advice of the Ven. Omalpe Sobitha Thera, he had dedicated his political career for justice and fairness and this National Award is a tribute to the policies he followed. Jayasuriya recalled that he entered politics on the invitation of the current President Ranil Wickremesinghe after he became the leader of the United National Party and said that he is happy to work in close contact with the people. He also stated that during his tenure as the Mayor, he was able to create a new culture in the Colombo Municipal Council and its success was even recognized internationally. Jayasuriya, who served as the Speaker of Parliament from 2015-2020, has also held a number of cabinet ministerial portfolios since he embarked on his active political career in 1995 representing the UNP. Prior to commencing his political career, Jayasuriya served in the Ceylon Army Volunteer Force from 1965-1972.

        "date": "February 3, 2023 12:21 pm",
        "content": "China has hit back at the remarks made by US Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs, Victoria Nuland that the terms extended by China to Sri Lanka to unlock IMF debt relief remain insufficient. In response to a question raised at a regular press conference on Thursday (Feb. 02), Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said the US Under Secretarys comments do not reflect the truth. During her recent official visit to Sri Lanka, Nuland told reporters in Colombo that Chinas offer on their financial assurances for Sri Lanka is not enough, adding that the IMF needs to see credible and specific assurance that matches the global lenders standard on debt restructuring prior to moving forward with an agreement. Sri Lanka is currently awaiting board approval from the IMF pertaining to the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) of USD 2.9 billion. Speaking further during the press conference, the Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson went on to note that the Export-Import Bank of China has already provided Sri Lanka with a letter to express support for its debt sustainability. Sri Lanka has responded positively and thanked China for that. She called on the United States to show some sincerity and actually do something to help Sri Lanka weather through the current difficulties rather than jabbing fingers at Chinas close cooperation with Sri Lanka. As a friendly neighbour and true friend, China has been closely following the difficulties and challenges facing Sri Lanka and providing assistance for the islands economic and social development to the best of Chinas capabilities, Mao continued. In response to a question on any ongoing conversation or talk between China and the IMF where the global lender has confirmed that Chinas assurances are credible and enough for the Fund to disburse the debt relief financial support, the spokesperson said China supports it financial institutions in having consultations with Sri Lanka to seek a proper settlement to its China-related debt issue. We also stand ready to work with relevant countries and international financial institutions to play a positive role in easing Sri Lankas debt burden.",

Accordingly, Mohan Samaranayake and PUCSLs deputy chairman Udeni Wickramasinghe have stepped down from their positions with immediate effect. Wickramasinghe vacated his position, citing personal reasons. Meanwhile, Samaranayake, in his resignation letter, said the work environment and the work style of the electricity sector regulator have become highly unprofessional, unpleasant and intolerable. The situation has degenerated to such an extent that on January 20, 2023 when a special meeting of the Commission was held, a group of thugs was organized and allowed inside the Commissions premises who directly threatened me with physical assault and destruction of property. This act of hooliganism was justified by insinuation by Chairman, PUCSL at the National Council meeting held in Parliament on January 24, 2023 with the participation of members of the Commission. His justification of threats against me indicates that I run the risk of being threatened and even assaulted in future, he continued. Samaranayake accused the PUCSL chairman Janaka Ratnakayake of violating Section 9(5) of the PUCSL Act and continuing to make decisions and statements purported to be that of the Commission without the concurrence of the rest of the members thereby making other members redundant. He also stressed that he has been humiliated and painted villain before the society. Failure on the part of the government authorities to counter legal and other arguments against the proposed electricity tariff hike with irrefutable facts, which leaves people in the quandary, Samaranayake added.",

        "content": "China today (Feb. 03) confirmed that its Export-Import Bank is offering Sri Lanka a two-year moratorium on loan repayments. Addressing a regular press conference, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said the EXIM Bank, as the official bilateral creditor, has provided a financing support document to Sri Lankas Ministry of Finance, Economic Stabilization and National Policies. According to Mao Ning, the EXIM Bank will provide Sri Lanka with an extension on the debt service due in 2022 and 2023, which will help relieve the islands short-term debt repayment pressure. This means that Sri Lanka will not have to repay the principal and interest due of the Banks loans during the above-mentioned period, she added. Speaking further the ministerial spokesperson, who stated that Chinas EXIM Bank is willing to have friendly consultation with Sri Lanka regarding medium- and long-term debt treatment in this window period, also noted that the Bank would make best efforts to contribute to the debt sustainability of the island nation. In the said document, the EXIM Bank has also reiterated its support for Sri Lanka in its loan application to the IMF. In the meantime, the Bank will continuously call on commercial creditors (including the International Sovereign Bondholders) to provide debt treatment in an equally comparable manner, and encourage multilateral creditors to do their utmost to make corresponding contributions, Mao Ning said further. Further, she recalled the assistance provided by China, as a friendly neighbor and true friend, for Sri Lankas economic and social development to the best of its capabilities. The financing support document is aimed at combining an immediate contingency measure and medium- and long-term debt treatment to rapidly, effectively and truly resolve Sri Lankas debt issue. As far as I have learned, China is the first official bilateral creditor to have taken the initiative to announce debt extension to Sri Lanka. This speaks to Chinas sincerity and action to support Sri Lankas effort to achieve debt sustainability. The Chinese official went on to call on all other creditors of Sri Lanka, especially multilateral creditors, to take synchronized, similar steps and give effective, strong support to Sri Lanka to help the country emerge from its default status at an early date and eventually work out an arrangement for Sri Lanka to achieve medium- and long-term debt sustainability. China also urged the IMF to take into full consideration the urgency of the situation in Sri Lanka and provide loan support as soon as possible to relieve the countrys liquidity strain. Mao Ning affirmed that going forward, China would continue to support relevant financial institutions in actively working out the debt treatment. We will work with relevant countries and international financial institutions to jointly play a positive role in helping Sri Lanka navigate the situation, ease its debt burden and achieve sustainable development.",

        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe has urged all the nations in the world which are undergoing difficulties to be united in seeking solutions. Addressing the African Envoys meeting held at the Presidential Secretariat this morning (Feb. 03), President Wickremesinghe explained the new phase of Sri Lankas foreign policy, adding that Sri Lanka and Africa have been there for each other during times of trouble, the Presidents Media Division (PMD) reported. Sri Lanka also shares a commonality with many African States in respect of its legal system, the PMD said. Sri Lanka also maintains significant economic ties with the African region, though there is scope for further growth. Investment, tourism, and migration flows have also grown in recent decades, though the African Continent remains small in terms of total flows to Sri Lanka, it added. Foreign Diplomats of the African Continent has commended President Wickremesinghes efforts in maintaining peace in the country and his commitment to reconnecting and strengthening relations with the African continent, according to the PMD. The Diplomats said that they focused on further strengthening the bilateral relationship by aiming at economic cooperation and investment, expanding tourism in Sri Lanka, and granting South African assistance, guidance, and counselling in setting up a credible truth-seeking mechanism to achieve a lasting reconciliation amongst communities. They also look forward to air and maritime connectivity to enhance the relationship with Sri Lanka and ensure continuous engagement. Speaking further the President has mentioned that 75 years ago Sri Lanka gained independence and worked together with India, Pakistan and Burma to ensure the countries that had gained independence during that period were able to make their voices heard. The end result was the Colombo Power Conference attended by these four powers and Indonesia. It was then decided to call the Afro-Asia Conference, the PMD added. The none-aligned movement gave the African countries a chance to demonstrate that they too have a voice in the affairs of the World. During the 1980s, the power structures of the world began changing with the collapse of the Soviet Union. Meanwhile, the focus was mainly on Sri Lanka as a result of the war and even after the war, the focus was still on the country due to issues regarding the economy and efforts on reconciliation. That phase is now coming to an end. President Wickremesinghe appreciated the African countries for all the support given to Sri Lanka in Geneva. Now as we see a genuine shift of power from West to East and to Asia and then Africa, that shift of power must continue. As we see that East Asia along with China is emerging, South Asia together with India and Africa will also follow towards the latter part of this century. So we must keep this relationship strengthened to ensure we have a bigger voice. There are two issues, one is the Ukraine situation which we are refusing to get involved in and the other one is the situation that is building up in Taiwan. What is happening in the world today is one-sided. Especially in the case of Africa, it needs to get more resources and develop a stronger voice. Sri Lanka supports Africa in this measure. Next is climate change. While billions are being given to the Ukraine war, very much is being pledged for Climate change. So we have to make our voice heard when we go to the UAE and we have to ensure that there is no compromise. My personal view is it should be a take or leave the situation. In these areas, Sri Lankas policy now is to look at the Western Indian Ocean and towards Africa. Sri Lanka has relations with the Middle East, but Africa is what Sri Lanka has to engage in politically, economically, culturally and with some of the other countries, sports-wise. Especially, Sri Lanka needs to open political dialogue with the African Continent. There are Sri Lankan companies that are willing to invest in Africa and we are encouraging them to connect with African countries. Africa will be important with Trans-African highways. It makes sense for all of us to work together. Therefore, whatever Sri Lanka can do to help, we will, the President added. --PMD--",

Read the full text of President Wickremesinghes message for the 75th Independence Day below: Our 75th Anniversary of Independence from colonial rule is being observed during an extremely critical and challenging time in the country. It is, indeed, a decisive moment. However it presents an opportunity for us not only to review our strengths and gains as a nation but also to rectify our errors and failures. Since 1948, we have, as a nation, undergone many tests and travails  from riots, insurgencies and war to natural disasters. These experiences have left us with a sense of inculcated resilience that has made us revive better when faced with adversity. Therefore, I am confident that even at this juncture we will pool our energies as the daughters and sons of one mother to rise up from the current economic abyss and build back stronger. There is a new economic and social reform agenda before the country with the objectives focusing first on recovery and then on renewed development. It is imperative for us to unite in its implementation so that we can emerge with a high level of economic prosperity. I pledge today to make the extremely difficult though vital decisions to achieve this goal with courage and determination. I anticipate the confidence and support of you, the people of our country, in this endeavour. I also take the opportunity to thank you, the Sri Lankan expatriate community, for your contribution towards the development of our motherland despite your distance. I would like to invite you to join us in securing a bright future for the younger generation of Sri Lankans who are at the vanguard of economic and social development. Your faith and investment in the unique and creative ideas of our talented youth who lack capital could give considerable hope and be of immense benefit to our country in this crisis. On this historic anniversary, let us all resolve to meet the challenges of this year with further patience and fortitude. I extend warm felicitations to you, Sri Lankans, here and aboard.",

The communication from President Biden was handed over to President Wickremesinghe by the US Under-Secretary for Political Affairs Victoria Nuland when she called on President Wickremesinghe on Wednesday (Feb. 01) at the Presidential Secretariat. Meanwhile, US Ambassador to Sri Lanka, Julie Chung also extended wishes for the 75th Independence anniversary.

        "content": "Prime Minister Dinesh Gunawardena has urged all citizens of Sri Lanka to work together towards the transformation and development of the country. In his wish for Sri Lankas 75th Independence Anniversary, Gunawardena stated that As proud citizens of this country, it is our responsibility to sincerely perform our duty to work together and transform the growth and development of our country. Keeping the sacrifices of our ancestors to win freedom in mind, we should take an oath to carve a better future for our motherland, the Premier said, adding that it is not only the freedom of the people of Sri Lanka being celebrated today, but also that it is a tribute to the ones who fought for it, to the ones who held a vision for our country, and to the ones who sacrificed themselves for the same. The great rebellions of Uva-Wellassa in 1818 and Matale in 1848 resulted in untold sacrifices and miseries and in the last century a nonviolent freedom struggle took place. The galaxy of leaders from Anagarika Dharmapala, D B Jayathilake, F R and D S Senanayake, Henry Pedris, T B Jayah, Ponnambalam Ramanathan, N M Perera, Phillip Gunawardena, S A Wickremesinghe to many other carried forward the independence movement towards its success. We must also pay our homage to the valiant members of armed forces who made similar sacrifices to sustain and safeguard the hard-won freedom from extremists and separatists during the last 75 years, he said. Speaking on the island nations ongoing economic crises, Gunawardena noted that the government has taken a series of actions to ensure the recovery of the economy, adding that our ardent desire is to overcome challenges and build an economically sound progressive nation. Meanwhile, Speaker of Parliament Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena also extended his wishes for the diamond jubilee of Sri Lankas independence. There is no better opportunity than this to make a mark on the world map as one country, an undivided Sri Lankan nation, a community that appreciates each others differences, he said, adding that however, to be united as a country and put our name before the world, we have to present many more significant innovations to the world. It is not wrong to say that such changes apply to the Sri Lankan state and society in which we live. He noted, however, that despite these celebrations, it must not be forgotten that Sri Lanka still has a multitude of challenges to be won. I do not think it is a good practice to defame the country without fulfilling our duty by overcoming various challenges as senior Sri Lankans of the country. The way in which our heroes of the past came to face imperialism strongly standing strong until February 04, 1948, let us dedicate this day for a sustainable future and eternal freedom. That is the message that we who are celebrating the Diamond Jubilee of an independent Sri Lanka should understand thoroughly, the Speaker concluded. Speaking on the occasion of Sri Lankas 75th independence, Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa urged all persons to stand together, not in a display of vanity or pride, but in a testament to our unwavering commitment to creating a brighter future for all Sri Lankans. While facing our challenges, let us remain steadfast in our belief that we can and will overcome them, he said in this regard. In an uplifting message on Twitter, Premadasa emphasised that this event be used as an opportunity to reignite the flames of hope, be a beacon of inspiration for one another and come together to create a legacy that will endure for generations, adding that the hardships faced by the people of Sri Lanka and sacrifices made by those who came before us must also be remembered on this occasion.",

The Secretary to PM Dinesh Gunawardena has given instructions to issue a gazette notification regarding the name of the locality, which has been known as Slave Island up until now, replacing it with Kompagngna Veediya in Sinhala, Tamil and English. Mr. Anura Dissanayake has directed the Secretary to the Ministry of Public Administration, Home Affairs, Local Government and Provincial Councils; Postmaster General; and the Commissioner of Colombo Municipal Council regarding this decision, which coincides with the 75th anniversary of Independence. Accordingly, road signs, postal usage, road signs, postal usage and voter registers associated with Kompagngna Veediya, Colombo 02 will be renamed as Kompagngna Veediya in the main three languages in the country The decision has been taken on the advice of PM Gunawardena since the nomenclature of Slave Island used during the colonial period signifies a different meaning. The name Slave Island was coined during the period of British colonial rule and was a reference to the usage of the island under Portuguese rule as a holding area for African slaves, most of them from the Swahili coast and Portuguese East Africa.",
