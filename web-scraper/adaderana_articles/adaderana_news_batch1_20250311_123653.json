        "date": "March 3, 2025 02:10 pm",
        "content": "Britains privacy watchdog, the Information Commissioners Office, on Monday launched an investigation into how TikTok, Reddit and online image sharing website Imgur safeguard childrens privacy. Social media companies use complex algorithms to prioritise content and keep users engaged. However, the fact that they amplify similar content can lead to children being influenced by increasing amounts of harmful material. The watchdog said it is probing how Chinese company ByteDances short-form video-sharing platform TikTok uses 1317-year-olds personal information to suggest content in their feed. Social media and discussion platform Reddit, and Imgur are being investigated over how they assess the age of child users, it said. If we find there is sufficient evidence that any of these companies have broken the law, we will put this to them and obtain their representations before reaching a final conclusion, the Information Commissioners Office said in a statement. In 2023, the ICO fined TikTok 12.7 million pounds (16 million) for breaching data protection law by using the personal data of children aged under 13 without parental consent. Reddit has been working closely with the ICO and intends to comply with all relevant regulations in the countries in which it operates, a spokesperson from the company told Reuters in an email. Most of our users are adults, but we have plans to roll out changes this year that address updates to UK regulations around age assurance, the Reddit spokesperson said. ByteDance, TikTok and Imgur did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. Britain has passed legislation that set tougher rules for social media platforms, including a mandate for them to prevent children from accessing harmful and age-inappropriate content by enforcing age limits and age-checking measures. Social media platforms including Facebook, Instagram and TikTok are required to tame their algorithms to filter out or downgrade harmful material to help protect children under proposed British measures published last year.

        "date": "March 3, 2025 04:45 pm",
        "content": "A Fundamental Rights (FR) petition has been filed before the Supreme Court, requesting a formal program to minimize elephant collisions with trains and a ruling that government authorities have violated fundamental human rights by failing to take appropriate action. The petition was submitted by a group of environmentalists, including the Centre for Environmental Justice, naming several officials as respondents, including the Director General of Wildlife, the General Manager of Railways, the Minister of Transport, the Minister of Environment, the Inspector General of Police (IGP), the Secretary of Defense, and the Attorney General (AG). The petitioners highlight an increasing trend in elephant collisions with trains. According to the petition, the countrys wild elephant population has declined from 5,879 in the 2011 census to 3,130 in the most recent survey and noted that official records indicate at least 151 elephants have died due to train collisions over the past 13 years. The petitioners allege that approximately 40 percent of these fatalities involved elephants between the ages of 30 and 40, which has negatively impacted the elephants population growth. Furthermore, the petition identifies the highest number of accidents on the railway line between Welikanda and Punani, where 23 elephant collisions were reported in 2022. Other frequently affected routes include Ambanpola and Galgamuwa, Gal Oya and Hingurakgoda, and Manampitiya and Welikanda, it said. Meanwhile, the petitioners argue that these statistics underscore the urgent need for a structured program to reduce elephant-train collisions. They request the Supreme Court to declare that government authorities have violated fundamental human rights by failing to prevent such incidents. Additionally, they seek an order directing the respondents to conduct forensic investigations into past collisions, implement speed limits for trains in high-risk areas, and introduce regulations under the Fauna and Flora Protection Ordinance to mitigate elephant-train collisions.",

This was discussed when the Committee met in Parliament recently under the chairmanship of the Minister of Agriculture, Livestock, Lands and Irrigation, K.D. Lal Kantha. Deputy Minister of Agriculture and Livestock Namal Karunaratne said that it is planned to release water for paddy fields after March 15 with the expectation of commencing cultivation of a larger area of land during the Yala season. The Deputy Minister further stated that all paddy fields will be cultivated by the end of April, the Parliamentary Communications Department said in a statement. The Members also drew the attention of the Committee to the existing issues related to the reclamation of paddy lands. While briefing the programme Eka Mitata Govi Bimata, the committee chairperson emphasized that this is not a programme for cultivating barren paddy fields. He further stated that crops that can be cultivated in each area should be identified on a scientific basis and those crops can be cultivated with the approval of the Agricultural Commissioner of the relevant area, the statement mentioned. The committee also discussed the maize stocks required by the country. Officials informed the committee that 275,000 metric tons of maize had been imported for animal feed between 2024 and January 31, 2025. The chairperson mentioned that the import of maize was halted after January 31, 2025. However, he also noted that while the annual maize requirement is 600,000 metric tons, the countrys maize production is insufficient to meet this demand. As a result, the chairperson stated that maize imports would need to resume in the future. Additionally, the committee highlighted the importance of providing opportunities for small and medium-scale entrepreneurs if maize imports are resumed. Furthermore, a plan has been developed to expand the area dedicated to maize cultivation in the country to 20,000 hectares, it added. Attention was also drawn to the issues existing in the countrys irrigation systems and the measures to be taken to resolve them. The committee chairperson, said that special attention will be paid to the irrigation issues existing in the Northern and Eastern provinces. Meanwhile, the annual report of the Colombo Commercial Fertilizers Limited for the year 20212022, the annual report of the National Institute of Post Harvest Management for the year 2022, the annual report of the National Livestock Development Board for the year 2019, the annual report of the Central Engineering Consultancy Bureau for the year 2023 and the annual performance report of the Department of Animal Production and Health for the year 2023, the annual performance report of the Ministry of Irrigation for the year 2023, the annual performance report of the Irrigation Department for the year 2023 and the performance report of the Department of Agrarian Development for the year 2019 were presented to the Committee for consideration.

        "date": "March 3, 2025 09:49 pm",
        "content": "Britain said on Monday there were several possible proposals on the table for a possible Ukraine ceasefire, after France floated a proposal for a month-long initial truce that could pave the way for peace talks. European countries, led by Britain and France, are looking at options for a peace proposal including Ukraine after last weeks Oval Office rupture between U.S. President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy. There are clearly a number of options on the table, Prime Minister Keir Starmers spokesman said. Im just not getting into a running commentary on the options. White House national security adviser Mike Waltz, when asked about the weekend activities of Europe rallying around Zelenskiy, told reporters: So, we welcome Europe stepping up for Europe, but they have to also invest in the capabilities to do so. France, Britain and potentially other European countries have offered to send troops to Ukraine in the event of a ceasefire, but say they would want support from the U.S., a proposal referred to as a backstop. Zelenskiy says a ceasefire must come with explicit security guarantees from the West to ensure Russia, which invaded Ukraine three years ago and holds about 20 of its territory, does not attack again. Trump has refused to give any such guarantees. Starmer hosted a summit of European leaders in London on Sunday and said European leaders had agreed to draw up a Ukraine peace plan to present to the United States. In an interview given on his way to the summit, French President Emmanuel Macron raised the possibility of a one-month ceasefire, although so far there has been no public endorsement from other allies. Such a truce on air, sea and energy infrastructure would allow us to determine whether Russian President Vladimir Putin is acting in good faith when he commits to a truce, French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot said of Macrons proposal. And thats when real peace negotiations could start. European ground troops would only be deployed to Ukraine in a second phase, Macron said in the interview published in Le Figaro. Zelenskiy, asked if he was aware of the plan mentioned by Macron, told reporters in London: Im aware of everything. European countries are adjusting to what some leaders describe as the biggest policy reversal since World War Two from Washington, especially after Fridays bust-up when Zelenskiy left the White House abruptly after a dressing down in front of cameras by Trump and Vice President JD Vance.

        "content": "Sri Lanka has reiterated the rejection of Resolutions 461, 511, and 571 and the external evidence gathering mechanism on Sri Lanka passed by the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) during the 58th Session of the council as the country concerned following the Oral Update on Sri Lanka by the High Commissioner for Human Rights. Furthermore, Sri Lanka has stated that the country remains steadfast in the belief that national ownership with gradual reforms, is the only practical way forward to transformative change. The island nation further expressed regret on the continuing inconsistent application of human rights principles through the work of the Council. This has resulted in the erosion of trust in the human rights architecture making countries less likely to respect the noble purposes for which the Human Rights Council was created, Ambassador and Permanent Representative of Sri Lanka to the United Nations in Geneva Himalee Subashini Arunatilaka has said. Sri Lanka has consistently spoken out against country specific resolutions that do not have the concurrence of the country concerned. We have reiterated our rejection of Resolutions 461, 511, and 571 and the external evidence gathering mechanism on Sri Lanka that has been set up using these divisive and intrusive resolutions, she added. Sri Lanka has also stated that the external evidence gathering mechanism on Sri Lanka within the OHCHR is an unprecedented and ad hoc expansion of the Councils mandate, and contradicts its founding principles of impartiality, objectivity and non-selectivity noting that no sovereign state can accept the superimposition of an external mechanism that runs contrary to its Constitution and which pre-judges the commitment of its domestic legal processes. Furthermore, serious concerns have been raised by a number of countries on the budgetary implications of this external mechanism, particularly at a time the UN is undergoing severe budgetary constraints, Arunatilaka highlighted. As reaffirmed at previous sessions, the Government of Sri Lanka is determined to deal with human rights challenges including reconciliation through domestic processes, she emphasized, adding that Sri Lanka will also continue its constructive engagement with the Human Rights Council and regular human rights instruments in a spirit of cooperation and constructive dialogue, as was done most recently when Sri Lanka actively and constructively engaged with the CEDAW committee for the review of our 9th periodic report. Additionally, Sri Lanka also reiterated its commitment to multilateral cooperation in pursuit of peace, prosperity, and sustainability along with the promotion and protection of all human rights. In the meantime, Sri Lanka has assured that the government has prioritized economic growth which will take place in a manner that is inclusive, where all citizens have enhanced economic opportunities allowing the resultant benefits to be reaped fairly by all strata of society. The rule of law, transparency, accountability and reconciliation will prevail in order to ensure sustained economic growth and social well-being of the people, Arunatilaka expressed. She has further pointed out that the government has committed to: - protect democracy and human rights of all citizens including addressing past issues - ensure the related domestic processes to be credible and independent within the Constitutional framework. - And, to examine carefully and expand the work of the proposed truth and reconciliation commission, to investigate acts of violence caused by racism and religious extremism Economic priorities of the Government include eradicating rural poverty, implementing the Clean Sri Lanka initiative to promote social, environmental, and ethical revival, and establishing a robust digital economy to foster innovation and sustainable growth. The Government is committed to ensuring assistance to all citizens affected by the conflict in consonance with its pledge to achieve sustainable peace, reconciliation and development in the conflict affected areas of the country, she added.",

        "title": "Pope Francis suffers new breathing crises, Vatican says",
        "date": "March 4, 2025 06:56 am",
        "content": "Pope Francis suffered two new acute respiratory crises Monday and was put back on noninvasive mechanical ventilation, in another setback to his battle to fight pneumonia, the Vatican said. Doctors extracted copious amounts of mucus from his lungs during two bronchoscopies, in which a camera-tipped tube was sent down into his airways with a sucker at the tip to suction out fluid. The Vatican said the mucus was his bodys reaction to the original pneumonia infection and not a new infection, given laboratory tests dont indicate any new bacteria. Francis remained alert, oriented and cooperated with medical personnel. The prognosis remained guarded. Doctors didnt say if he remained in stable condition, though they referred to the crises in the past tense, suggesting they were over. The crises were a new setback in what has become a more than two-week battle by the 88-year-old pope, who has chronic lung disease and had part of one lung removed, to overcome a complex respiratory infection. Dr. John Coleman, a pulmonary critical care doctor at Northwestern Medicine in Chicago, said the episodes were more concerning than the last one on Friday, in which Francis had a coughing fit, inhaled some vomit that needed to be extracted and then was put on the noninvasive mechanical ventilation for a day and then didnt need it anymore. The use of bronchoscopies reflects a worrying level of mucus and phlegm in the lungs, Coleman said. The fact that they had to go in there and remove it manually is concerning, because it means that he is not clearing the secretions on his own, he said. Hes taking little steps forward and then steps back, said Coleman, who is not involved in Francis care. In a late update, the Vatican said the episodes were caused by a significant accumulation of mucus in his lungs and bronchial spasms. Copious secretions, were extracted during the bronchoscopies and the pope was put back on noninvasive mechanical ventilation, a mask that covers his nose and mouth and pumps oxygen into the lungs, the Vatican said. Francis, who is not physically active, uses a wheelchair and is overweight, had been undergoing respiratory physiotherapy to try to improve his lung function. But the accumulation of the secretions in his lungs was a sign that he doesnt have the muscle tone to cough vigorously enough to expel the fluid. The Vatican hasnt released any photos or videos of Francis since before he entered the hospital on Feb. 14 with a complex lung infection. This has become the longest absence of his 12-year papacy. The Vatican has defended Francis decision to recover in peace and out of the public eye. But on Monday one of Francis closest friends at the Vatican, Archbishop Vincenzo Paglia, urged him to let his voice be heard, saying the world needs to hear it. We need men like him who are truly universal and not only one-sided, Paglia said, speaking after a press conference to launch the annual assembly of his Pontifical Academy for Life, the Vaticans bioethics academy, which has as this years theme The End of the World? Francis wrote a message to the assembly in which he lamented that international organizations are increasingly ineffective to combat the threats facing the world and are being undermined by short-sighted attitudes concerned with protecting particular and national interests. It was dated Feb. 26 and signed from Gemelli Polyclinic. Doctors often use noninvasive ventilation to stave off an intubation, or the use of invasive mechanical ventilation. Francis has not been intubated during this hospitalization. Its not clear if he has provided any advance directives about the limits of his care if he declines or loses consciousness. Catholic teaching holds that life must be defended from conception until natural death. It insists that chronically ill patients, including those in vegetative states, must receive ordinary care such as hydration and nutrition, but extraordinary or disproportionate care can be suspended if it is no longer beneficial or is only prolonging a precarious and painful life. Francis articulated that to a meeting of Paglias bioethics body in 2017, saying there was no obligation to have recourse in all circumstances to every possible remedy. He added: It thus makes possible a decision that is morally qualified as withdrawal of overzealous treatment. Paglia, whose office helps articulate the Catholic Churchs position on end-of-life care, said Francis is like any other Catholic and would follow church teaching if it came to that. Today the pope is giving us an extraordinary teaching on fragility, he added. Today the pope, not through words but with his body, is reminding all of us, we elderly people to begin with, that we are all fragile and therefore we need to take care of each other. Francis 17-night hospitalization is by no means reaching the papal record that was set during St. John Paul IIs numerous lengthy hospitalizations over a quarter century. The longest single hospitalization occurred in 1981, when John Paul spent 55 days in Gemelli for a minor operation and then a long infection that followed. Source: AP --Agencies",

        "content": "International Monetary Funds (IMF) Senior Mission Chief for Sri Lanka Peter Breuer commended Sri Lankas economic recovery in the recent years, and stated that as economic opportunities return to Sri Lanka, income will be increased and poverty will be reduced making it more attractive for the people to remain in Sri Lanka, not leave or emigrate. Speaking during the Press Conference on the IMF Executive Boards completion of the third review of Sri Lankas Extended Fund Facility (EFF) program, the IMF Senior Mission Chief stated that Sri Lankas reserves have increased significantly so far under the EFF program. They have reached about half of the program objectives already which is very impressive, Breuer expressed. Commenting further, he said: I think its quite clear that things really have turned around significantly in Sri Lanka. When I first got to Sri Lanka in June 2022 everybody was on a line somewhere to get fuel, to get cooking gas, get food or medication. Economic activity was very subdued. I think in real terms Sri Lanka lost around 10 of its economic activity as a result of this crisis. Since then in the short amount of time that the program has been there, basically since 2023, it has already recovered 40 of the income it has lost in the preceding 5 years. In a short amount of time Sri Lanka has already a very significant recovery  the most recent growth number was 5.5. So I think the things are turning around significantly in Sri Lanka and that will have an impact on the indicators that we care about such as poverty. As economic opportunities return to Sri Lanka, income will be increased and poverty will be reduced. Also, it will be more attractive to remain in Sri Lanka not leave or emigrate. Those who have emigrated will find opportunities back in Sri Lanka, Breuer signed off.",

The report commended Sri Lankas peaceful elections and the smooth transition of power last year and has reviewed the actions of the incumbent government. We recognise that the new Sri Lankan Government has only been in place for four months, and we encourage Sri Lanka to use the opportunity that this transition represents to address the challenges it faces, the report added. Furthermore, it stated: We appreciate the Governments commitment to making meaningful progress on reconciliation and the initial steps taken, including returning land, lifting roadblocks, and allowing communities in the North and East to commemorate the past and to memorialise their loved ones. Additionally, the Sri Lanka Core Group report welcome commitments to implement devolution in accordance with the constitution and to make progress on governance reforms.

We reaffirm our willingness to work with the Government to ensure that any future transitional justice mechanisms are independent, inclusive, meaningful, and meet the expectations of affected communities.

        "content": "Sri Lanka should avoid tax exemptions and focus on passing a national budget that is in line with parameters set by the International Monetary Fund to continue with a 2.9 billion program from the international lender, an IMF official said on Tuesday. Sri Lanka mounted a remarkable recovery from a deep financial crisis triggered by a record shortfall of dollars three years ago, the global lender said after approving a fourth tranche of 334 million under a Extended Fund Facility (EFF) program. However, the South Asian island nation must now boost tax compliance, improve targeting of social welfare, and smoothen capital spending to support better management of public finances, Peter Breuer, IMFs senior mission chief for Sri Lanka told reporters in an online briefing. The IMF also backed restoring cost-recovery electricity pricing to bolster finances of the island nations power monopoly after Sri Lanka reduced tariffs by 20 in January. At the next tariff setting it is important to ensure that tariffs are once again set to recover the cost, Breuer said. Another important issue for the next review will of course be that the budget that is finally passed this month is consistent with the parameters so this is something we will be watching very carefully. Additionally, he said it is crucial that Sri Lanka finalises bilateral agreements with official creditors including Japan, India and China after Colombo secured a preliminary agreement on a 10 billion debt rework last June. The IMF finalised the third review after Sri Lankas new president Anura Kumara Dissanayake rolled out his first full-year budget last month, which included committing to a primary surplus target of 2.3 of GDP for 2025 set under the IMF program. The IMF bailout secured in March 2023 helped stabilise financial and business conditions after Sri Lankas economy contracted by 7.3 at the depth of its financial crisis and by 2.3 in 2023. Sri Lankas economy is projected to have grown by 4.5 last year with growth forecast at 3 in 2025, according to latest IMF data. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

Elaborating on the tax structure, the Deputy Minister said, Individuals who export digital services receive a special advantage. The first Rs. 150,000 of their Rs. 500,000 income is exempt from tax. The next Rs. 83,000 is taxed at 6, while the remainder is taxed at 15. Thus, they receive a special benefit. To avail of this advantage, they must prove that their income was earned through exporting services when submitting their tax returns. This is why they are required to submit them through banks. Whether some individuals are evading taxes under this guise is a separate issue, but otherwise, this is not an unfair tax, he added.",

        "date": "March 4, 2025 01:47 pm",
        "content": "President Donald Trump is ordering a pause on shipments of US military aid to Ukraine after his heated Oval Office argument with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky last week, a White House official told CNN Monday. The halt in aid, which came after Trump held a series of meetings with top national security officials at the White House, could have dire effect on Ukraines war-fighting abilities, officials and analysts said. It will remain in place until Trump determines Zelensky has made a commitment to seeking peace talks, one official said, essentially forcing Ukraine to a negotiating table by threatening further losses on the battlefield. The president has been clear that he is focused on peace. We need our partners to be committed to that goal as well. We are pausing and reviewing our aid to ensure that it is contributing to a solution, the White House official said. After more than a week of open hostility between Washington and Kyiv, Mondays pause was the most material sign of how far the relationship has deteriorated since Trump took office. In recent weeks, Trump has echoed Russian President Vladimir Putins talking points, falsely claiming Ukraine started the war and accusing Zelensky of being a dictator, but his decision to halt the delivery of military aid is a move that could have real consequences for the balance of the conflict and strengthen Putins hand. The pause will apply to all military equipment not yet inside Ukraine, officials said, and amounts to a direct response to what Trump views as Zelenskys bad behavior last week. Ukraine could likely sustain its current fighting pace for several weeks  perhaps until the start of the summer  before a US pause would begin to have a major effect, Western officials said in the wake of the decision. The Biden administration rushed shipments of weapons to Ukraine in its waning days, providing the country with large stockpiles of advanced weapons. It is those sophisticated weapons  including the long-range ATACMS missiles  that have allowed Ukraine to strike deep into Russian territory, a strategy that could suffer if those weapons remain paused. While European nations may be able to replace US shipments of artillery, supplemented by Ukraines own growing defense industry, the most advanced weapons used by Kyiv come from the United States. Impact could be crippling The impact is going to be big. I would call it crippling, said Mark Cancian, a senior adviser with the Center for Strategic and International Studies who has closely followed the war. Cancian estimated that Ukraine would feel the impacts of the pause in aid within two to four months, as aid from European countries helps Kyiv remain in the fight for now. Thats why they dont fall off a cliff, but when your supplies get cut in half, eventually that shows up on the front lines, Cancian said. Their front lines would continue to buckle and eventually they would break and Ukraine would have to accept an adverse  even catastrophic  peace settlement. But Cancian warned the Trump administration has more forms of aid to Ukraine that can be paused or canceled altogether, including intelligence sharing and the training of Ukrainian forces. There might be a way out of this, but its going to be extremely humiliating for Zelensky, Cancian said. The White House made the decision to pause military aid to Ukraine for now as officials seek an acknowledgement from Zelensky about the breakdown in relations following Fridays blowup in the Oval Office. According to several officials, Trump and his senior aides are seeking an acknowledgement from Zelensky  potentially in the form of a public apology  before moving ahead with a deal on Ukraines rare earth minerals, which had been close to agreement before Fridays meeting, or a discussion on continuing foreign aid. The decision to halt the aid was made later on Monday, one person said, and is part of a pressure strategy on Ukraine. Secretary of State Marco Rubio publicly called for Zelensky to apologize for Friday in an interview on CNN. The halt puts Trump even more clearly at odds with the United States traditional European allies like Britain and France, who made clear their support for Zelensky at a summit in London on Sunday. There is a capability gap that Europe cannot fill alone, one US official said. A European official called the Trump administrations decision to pause military aid to Ukraine petty and wrong. The official said it will immediately deepen distrust in the US government among the Ukrainian people. The official also predicted it will cause unnecessary civilian casualties, as Ukraine will not be able to defend against Russian air attacks after they run out of air defense missiles. Im beyond disappointed, the official told CNN. Since the start of the war, the Biden administration announced 74 separate packages of military aid pulled directly from US inventories, allowing the critical munitions and supplies to flow quickly to Ukraine. The largest of these packages was nearly 3 billion, though most were far smaller. Zelensky has repeatedly thanked the US for the weapons on social media, as well as in calls and meetings with American officials. The pause comes one day after a defense official told CNN that military aid to Ukraine announced by the Biden administration was still flowing. Those shipments included critical munitions such as anti-tank weapons, thousands of artillery rounds, and rockets. Those shipments were expected to continue for several weeks, but the decision from the Trump administration freezes the aid that was en route. DoD is also providing other capabilities, such as armored vehicles, as soon as required repairs are completed, the defense official said on Sunday. The US had set up facilities in Poland to repair Western equipment damaged on the battlefield before sending it back to the Ukrainian military. There are also multiple longer-term contracts between arms manufacturers and the US to send weapons systems and air defense systems to Ukraine. Mixed reaction from Republicans Republicans in Congress, where the party holds majorities in both chambers, have been split on continuing aid to Ukraine amid its three-year war with Russia. Earlier Monday, Sen. Markwayne Mullin, a Trump ally, said he thought the US obligation to Ukraine only goes so far, saying, the American taxpayers are tired of funding this war, and theres no end in sight. I dont believe that any of us sitting here believes that Ukraine can win this war, and the president is saying, Lets bring an end to it, the Oklahoma Republican continued, adding that if Zelensky wants the US to continue negotiating peace, then we will. However, he warned if Zelensky doesnt want to negotiate peace, then its not our job to make the taxpayers continue to fund an endless war. GOP Sen. Susan Collins, however, denounced the pause on Monday night, arguing that the US needs to continue backing its ally. This is a critical time for Ukraine. And I managed the Ukraine supplemental last year that provided additional help to Ukraine, and I do not think we should be pausing our efforts. Its the Ukrainians who are shedding blood, the Maine Republican said. Collins acknowledged that Congress may not be able to do anything to ensure Ukraine continues to receive aid from the US. A lot of it is linked to the presidents drawdown authority, she noted, pointing to accusations during former President Joe Bidens term that he had slow walked aid. Unfortunately, weve seen this movie before, and I remain convinced that its not only in Ukraines interest but our interest to back Ukraine because Putin is not going to stop there, she said. House Foreign Affairs Chair Republican Rep. Brian Mast told CNN he knew it was an option for the Trump administration to pause all US military aid to Ukraine. I think people can assume that everything is on the table with Ukraine right now, he said. Source: CNN --Agencies",

This order was issued when the relevant petition was taken up before a three-member Supreme Court judge bench comprising Justices Gamini Amarasekara, Kumuduni Wickremesinghe and Sobhitha Rajakaruna today (04). On March 01, 2024, the then Additional Secretary to the Ministry of Health Saman Ratnayake was arrested by the CID over the controversial procurement of substandard human intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) vials. Prior to the apprehension of Ratnayake, several arrests had been made in connection with the drug procurement scam including the former Minister of Health Keheliya Rambukwella, former Health Ministry Secretary Janaka Chandragupta, the Director of the Health Ministrys Medical Supplies Division (MSD) and three other officials of the same division, as well as the owner of the company, which is said to have imported the batch of substandard Immunoglobulin vials by forging documents. In October 2023, the National Medicines Regulatory Authority (NMRA) revealed that forged documents were found to have been submitted for Customs clearance to procure a batch of vials containing human immunoglobulin, an antibody produced by blood plasma cells, which later failed the quality tests. The product, which was said to have been manufactured by Livealth Biopharma Pvt Ltd. India, was imported by a local medicine supplier called Isolez Biotech Pharma AG (Pvt) Ltd. However, the India-based manufacturer has denied having a hand in this fraudulent activity and communicated to the NMRA that it has neither manufactured, supplied nor exported these products to any party. Reportedly, funds to the tune of Rs. 144 million have been misappropriated through the unlawful procurement of 22,500 vials of IVIG.",

        "date": "March 4, 2025 04:56 pm",
        "content": "One of the worlds most prolific blood donors - whose plasma saved the lives of more than two million babies - has died. James Harrison died in his sleep at a nursing home in New South Wales, Australia on 17 February, his family said on Monday. He was 88. Known in Australia as the man with the golden arm, Harrisons blood contained a rare antibody, Anti-D, which is used to make medication given to pregnant mothers whose blood is at risk of attacking their unborn babies. The Australian Red Cross Blood Service who paid tribute to Harrison, said he had pledged to become a donor after receiving transfusions while undergoing a major chest surgery when he was 14. He started donating his blood plasma when he was 18 and continued doing so every two weeks until he was 81. In 2005, he had the world record for most blood plasma donated - a title he held until 2022 when he was overtaken by a man in the US. Harrisons daughter, Tracey Mellowship, said her father was very proud to have saved so many lives, without any cost or pain. He always said it does not hurt, and the life you save could be your own, she said. Mellowship and two of Harrisons grandchildren are also recipients of anti-D immunisations. It made James happy to hear about the many families like ours, who existed because of his kindness, she said. Anti-D jabs protect unborn babies from a deadly blood disorder called haemolytic disease of the foetus and newborn, or HDFN. The condition occurs at pregnancy when the mothers red blood cells are incompatible with that of their growing baby. The mothers immune system then sees the babys blood cells as a threat and produces antibodies to attack them. This can seriously harm the baby, causing severe anaemia, heart failure, or even death. Before anti-D interventions were developed in the mid-1960s, one in two babies diagnosed with HDFN died. It is unclear how Harrisons blood came to be so rich in anti-D, but some reports said it had to do with the massive blood transfusion he received at 14. There are fewer than 200 anti-D donors in Australia, but they help an estimated 45,000 mothers and their babies every year, according to the Australian Red Cross Blood Service, also known as Lifeblood. Lifeblood has been working with Australias Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research to grow anti-D antibodies in the lab by replicating blood and immune cells from Harrison and other donors. Researchers involved hope lab-made anti-D can one day be used to help pregnant women worldwide. Creating a new therapy has long been a holy grail, Lifebloods research director David Irving said. He noted the scarcity of donors committed to regular donation, who are able to produce antibodies in sufficient quality and quantity. Source: BBC --Agencies",

        "title": "Trump and TSMC announce 100 billion plan to build five new US factories",
        "date": "March 4, 2025 05:57 pm",
        "content": "Taiwan semiconductor company TSMC plans to make a fresh 100 billion investment in the United States that involves building five additional chip facilities there in coming years, its CEO announced with President Donald Trump on Monday. Taiwans dominant position as a maker of chips used in technology from cellphones and cars to fighter jets has sparked concerns of over-reliance on the island, especially as China ramps up pressure to assert its sovereignty claims. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co, the worlds largest contract chipmaker and a leading supplier to major U.S. hardware manufacturers, unveiled the plan as Chief Executive C.C. Wei met Trump at the White House. We must be able to build the chips and semiconductors that we need right here, Trump said. Its a matter of national security for us. TSMC said the expansion included plans for three new chip fabrication plants, two advanced packaging facilities and a major research and development centre. The outlay of 100 billion to boost domestic production and make the United States less reliant on semiconductors made in Asia, follows news last April that TSMC aims to expand planned U.S. investment by 25 billion to 65 billion and add a third Arizona factory by 2030. TSMC did not give a timeframe for any of its new investments, apart from saying the effort would add 40,000 construction jobs over the next four years. Construction on its first Arizona plant was plagued by delays, with the company eventually starting chip production in 2024 at a higher cost than at its facilities in Taiwan. The companys Taiwan-listed shares fell 2 on Tuesday. Higher costs are definitely a concern for TSMC, said Andrew Tsai, chairman of Taiwan consulting firm Capital Investment Management Corp. As a key manufacturing partner to Nvidia , Qualcomm and Advanced Micro Devices , TSMC is central to the U.S. chip industry, and bringing more of its production to U.S. soil would solve a major supply chain risk for those firms. The Taiwan company could also play a central role in saving rival Intel. Trump administration officials met Wei in New York this year about taking a majority stake in a joint venture in Intels factory unit, as part of a deal for several chip firms to take a stake in the venture, a source familiar with the matter said. Intel did not respond to questions about the meetings. For Trump, the announcement helps show voters he is fulfilling his campaign pledge to do more to bolster domestic industries and create jobs. It is the latest in a string of such developments. In February, Apple said it would invest 500 billion in the next four years, although much of that was routine spending. Emirati billionaire Hussain Sajwani and SoftBank have also promised multi-billion dollar investments in the United States. On Monday, TSMC said it looked forward to discussing our shared vision for innovation and growth in the semiconductor industry, as well as exploring ways to bolster the technology sector along with our customers. Taiwans cabinet said on Tuesday it would review the investment in line with its laws, which require government approval for any large overseas investment by a Taiwan company, but that it viewed overseas investments that would raise Taiwans overall competitiveness positively. In addition, Taiwans presidential office said its review would also consider the interests of the investors and Taiwan. This ensures that while TSMC expands its investment in the U.S., the most advanced processes will remain in Taiwan, said Karen Kuo, a spokesperson for the Presidential Office. TSMC did not say what technology it would use in those facilities. Last year the company agreed to produce the worlds most advanced 2-nanometer technology at its second Arizona factory, expected to begin production in 2028. TSMC also agreed to use its most advanced chip making technology, called A16, in Arizona. Chips Act The first Trump administration brought TSMC to Arizona in 2019 and introduced legislation that later became the CHIPS and Science Act, passed in 2022 under President Joe Biden to provide 52.7 billion in subsidies for American semiconductor production and research. Last year, the U.S. commerce department finalised a 6.6-billion government subsidy for TSMC to produce semiconductors in Phoenix, Arizona, while the 100 billion unveiled on Monday would be eligible for a 25 manufacturing investment tax credit under the 2022 law. Under Biden, the commerce department convinced all five leading-edge global semiconductor firms to locate factories in the United States in the effort to tackle national security risks from imported chips. China claims Taiwan as its territory, but the democratically elected government in Taipei rejects Beijings sovereignty claims. On Monday, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said TSMC and other companies were investing in the United States as they sought to avoid Trumps new tariffs. Lutnick told lawmakers in January that the Biden-era program was an excellent down payment to rebuild the sector, but he has declined to commit to grants approved under Biden, saying he wanted to read them and analyze them and understand them. Last month, a TSMC spokesperson said the company had received 1.5 billion in CHIPS Act money before the new administration came in, according to the terms of its agreement.

        "title": "Clifford Chance committed to advising Sri Lanka through final stages of debt restructuring",
        "date": "March 4, 2025 09:36 pm",
        "content": "As the IMF Executive Board recently approved Sri Lankas Third Review of its IMF-supported program, Clifford Chance says it remains committed to advising Sri Lanka through the final stages of its debt restructuring process in 2025. Clifford Chance, alongside financial advisor Lazard, has successfully advised the Government of Sri Lanka on its sovereign bond exchange offer, marking a pivotal moment in the countrys multi-year debt restructuring process. This marks the final step in a comprehensive effort to restore Sri Lankas debt sustainability following a moratorium in April 2022. The sovereign bond exchange offer, one of the most complex in recent years, introduced several innovations to sovereign debt restructuring. Notably, the offer included the issuance of macro-linked bonds and governance-linked bonds. Clifford Chance says it played a key role in advising on the legal structuring and drafting of these innovative financial instruments. The successful execution of this exchange offer and the final distribution of new bonds on February 27, 2025, brought the long-awaited debt restructuring process to its conclusion. This transaction adds to Clifford Chances robust track record of advising on complex sovereign debt restructurings, the firm said. Deborah Zandstra, the Clifford Chance partner leading the mandate, expressed her gratitude for the opportunity to work with Sri Lanka throughout the restructuring process. It has been a privilege to advise and support Sri Lanka over the past two and a half years. We are thankful for the trust placed in us and for the collaborative approach we shared with Sri Lankan authorities, the IMF country team, and the Paris Club Secretariat. The core team working on the sovereign bond exchange offer included partners Jon Zonis and Deborah Zandstra, along with senior associates James Kelton and Sophie Wilkinson. Additional support was provided by partners Avrohom Gelber and associates Paula Ferreira, Agata Radajczyk, David Rondon, and Gil Shauly across Clifford Chances global network. Clifford Chance has also been instrumental in advising Sri Lanka on the broader debt restructuring process, including domestic debt restructuring and negotiations with official bilateral creditors such as the Export-Import Bank of China. The firm has worked closely with the IMF and the Official Creditor Committee in the Paris Club to navigate complex negotiations with Sri Lankas commercial creditors, including China Development Bank. Clifford Chances expertise in managing complex sovereign debt restructurings has been instrumental in Sri Lankas financial recovery. The firms leadership in guiding the bond exchange offer and broader debt negotiations was crucial to the successful execution of the deal, marking a significant milestone in Sri Lankas efforts to restore debt sustainability. This successful restructuring, culminating in the final bond distribution, reinforces Clifford Chances position as a global leader in financial advisory services.

        "date": "March 4, 2025 09:42 pm",
        "content": "Prime Minister Dr. Harini Amarasuriya stated that the qualitative change required for a new society should begin within ourselves and that the government has planned to develop cooperatives suited to the modern world while strengthening the rural economy. The Prime Minister made this statement while addressing the members of the Womens Forum held at the Sunanda Theatre, Aranayake, according to Prime Ministers Media Division. Speaking further, Prime Minister Dr. Harini Amarasuriya said: We have come to the right place with our long-standing efforts. Now, we must guide the country on the right path. We have started to build a nation where everyone can live happily and prosperously. This requires us to make the necessary changes and correct past mistakes. However, this transformation cannot be achieved by the government alone. Government officials, religious leaders, and citizens must step forward. We must work collectively towards our shared goal. Women have united to rewrite the political history of this country in 2024. To continue shaping the future of Sri Lanka, women must come forward and take on leadership roles. The Clean Sri Lanka program initiated by the government is not solely focused on environmental cleanliness. It also aims to clean and transform our mindset and behavior. A spiritual and attitudinal change is necessary. Change must begin with individualsfrom their homes, villages, and workplaces. Women play a crucial role in this journey of national transformation. Today, we observe the opposition in Parliament behaving as they are more Marxist than us, acting as if they have studied Lenin more than we have. This years budget has been designed with economic democracy at its core, ensuring benefits for all. The public and private sectors, cooperatives, and citizens must all contribute to economic management. Public servants basic salaries had not increased for years, but this years budget has addressed this issue. The public service must be transformed to provide efficient services to the people, making it an attractive sector. The salaries of teachers and principals have been placed among the highest salary grades currently available in Sri Lanka. To improve education and provide quality learning opportunities for children, teachers must be empowered both in knowledge and spirit. These efforts are aimed at enhancing the quality of public service institutions. The era when political favoritism was a prerequisite for getting things done has ended. Today, government officials no longer receive phone calls from politicians regarding administrative matters. The government has initiated a program to integrate women into the economy, gradually removing barriers to their participation. We are working towards creating a safe society where women can contribute to economic activities while managing their household responsibilities. To support this, we are developing pre-schools, daycare centers, and health services. Opportunities must be created for those engaged in agriculture to acquire technical training and modern knowledge efficiently. This will strengthen the rural economy. The government firmly believes that quality education is the key to national transformation. Accordingly, new education reforms will be introduced from 2026. A significant allocation has been made in this years budget for the development of teacher training and the necessary infrastructure to support these reforms. A large gathering, including the Maha Sangha, Minister of Environment Dhammika Patabedi, Member of Parliament Nanda Bandara, and other peoples representatives and women from the Aranayake area, attended the event, the statement added.",

        "date": "March 4, 2025 10:22 pm",
        "content": "Fishermen of Rameswaram on Tuesday ended their eight-day long strike, a day after Chief Minister M K Stalin hiked the financial aid to fishermen whose boats were impounded in Sri Lanka and assistance for families of fishermen languishing in the island nations jail. The fishermen also called off their indefinite fast, which they had begun on March 1. Announcing the decision to media persons, fishermen leader and convenor V P Jesu Raja said the decision to call off the stir was taken at a meeting of various association representatives. A resolution adopted at the meeting thanked Mr Stalin for hiking the financial aid for owners of impounded boats from Rs 6 lakh to Rs 8 lakh and daily assistance for family members of arrested fishermen from Rs 350 to Rs 500. The fishermen thanked the Chief Minister for instructed MPs from Tamil Nadu to draw the attention of the Ministry of External Affairs and brief officials about the situation and ensure that the jailed fishermen and their boats were released safely. The members said in view of the efforts taken by the government and the assurance from the Chief Minister that the issue would be taken up with the Union government, the fishermen resolved to drop the indefinite strike as a mark of respect and a message that they were ready to cooperate with the governments. The fishermen associations appealed to the Union government to help them have a dialogue with the fishermen leaders of the Northern Province in Sri Lanka. We will explain our problems and let them also share their difficulties.... Mr Jesu Raja said and urged the Centre to take it up with the highest levels in the Sri Lankan government for safe release of the fishermen and their trawlers. The members said a permanent solution should also be devised and give a relief to the fishermen, who have been traditionally fishing in the Palk Straits. In the event of any negative response from the governments, the meeting resolved to indulge in a rail roko agitation on March 21 and also if needed, block the Pamban Rail Bridge inauguration. Though there were division in the views of the members in seeking compensation, they were unanimous in continuing their stir such as rail block agitation and among others. As the Katchatheevu festival at the St. Antonys Church is scheduled to take place on March 14 and 15, the fishermen associations decided to take the next course of action after the event. But, they said that the rail roko agitation would happen in the event of non-compliance of their demands by the governments. According to Mr Jesu Raja, the fishermen may venture into the sea from Saturday (March 8). They had stayed away from normal fishing activities since February 24, he said.

        "date": "March 5, 2025 06:57 am",
        "content": "Volodymyr Zelensky said he was ready to work under Donald Trumps strong leadership to achieve a lasting peace days after their explosive Oval Office meeting. The Ukrainian president described the White House showdown as regrettable in a lengthy social media post in the wake of the US announcing a pause in military aid to Kyiv. Zelensky said it was time to make things right, after Trump had accused him of not being ready to come to the negotiating table. The Ukrainian leader also outlined the first stages of how the war could be ended. We are ready to work fast to end the war, and the first stages could be the release of prisoners and truce in the sky  ban on missiles, long-ranged drones, bombs on energy and other civilian infrastructure  and truce in the sea immediately, if Russia will do the same, he wrote. Then we want to move very fast through all next stages and to work with the US to agree a strong final deal. In his social media post, Zelensky said Fridays meeting did not go the way it was supposed to be, adding: It is regrettable that it happened this way, he wrote. It is time to make things right. We would like future co-operation and communication to be constructive. He also reiterated that Ukraine was ready to sign a minerals deal with the US, after the failure to do so at the Washington meeting. Ukraine woke to the news on Tuesday that the US was pausing and reviewing its military aid to the country after a breakdown in diplomacy last week. In his post, Zelensky offered an overt declaration of gratitude for the help the US has so far given to his country. We do really value how much America has done to help Ukraine maintain its sovereignty and independence, he wrote. And we remember the moment when things changed when President Trump provided Ukraine with Javelins. We are grateful for this, he added, referring to the US anti-tank missile system sold to Ukraine during Trumps first administration. During Fridays meeting in the Oval Office, Vice-President JD Vance accused Zelensky of being ungrateful for the military support the US had provided. Have you said thank you once this entire meeting? Vance said, before Trump told Zelensky he was not being very thankful. Zelensky defended himself in the meeting, and began an interview with Fox News in the hours afterwards, saying: Im very thankful to Americans for all your support. The Oval Office meeting between Zelensky and US officials last week was due to conclude with the two parties signing a deal that would grant the US access to rare earth minerals in Ukraine. After the clash, which saw Trump accuse Zelensky of gambling with World War III, the Ukrainian delegation left without signing the deal  Trump told Zelensky come back when youre ready for peace. Trump is due to deliver an address to Congress later on Tuesday, during which the Reuters news agency reports he plans to announce a minerals deal between US and Ukraine has been signed. A number of Ukraines allies have commented on the latest from the Ukrainian president, including UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, who welcomed Zelenskys steadfast commitment to securing peace. It is vital that all parties worked towards a lasting and secure peace for Ukraine as soon as possible, a statement from No 10 said. Likewise, French President Emmanuel Macron praised Zelenskys willingness to re-engage in dialogue with Trump, the Elysee Palace said. Days before his meeting with Zelensky, the US President had met with Macron, who travelled to Washington with a warning to Trump: You cant be weak in the face of Putin. While European leaders rallied behind Zelensky following the clash, Natos secretary general advised the Ukrainian leader to find a way to restore his relationship with Trump. Speaking to the BBC the following day, Mark Rutte said he had told him we have to respect what Trump has done for Ukraine so far. Zelenskys statement falls short of an apology to Trump, which those in the US presidents camp had called for. In Moscow, Vladimir Putins team earlier welcomed the USs pause to military aid as likely to be the best contribution to peace. If the US stops, or pauses these supplies, this will probably be the best contribution to the cause of peace, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told the BBCs Steve Rosenberg. Trump himself has not commented on the pause to aid, nor Zelenskys response, however he did earlier berate the Ukrainian leader following his meetings with European allies at the weekend. A Sunday summit - hosted by the UK prime minister - was intended as a show of support for Ukraine. After the meeting, Zelensky said a deal to end the war between Ukraine and Russia was still very, very far away. Trump described this as the worst statement that could have been made by Zelensky, in a post on his Truth Social platform. It is what I was saying, this guy doesnt want there to be peace as long as he has Americas backing, the president wrote. Source: BBC --Agencies",

        "content": "Two suicide bombings breached a wall at a military base in northwestern Pakistan before other attackers stormed the compound and were repelled in violence that killed at least 12 people and wounded 30 others, according to officials and a local hospital. A group affiliated with the Pakistani Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack in Bannu, in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, and said that dozens of members of Pakistani security forces were killed. The military didnt immediately confirm any casualties, but Bannu District Hospital said that at least a dozen people were dead. The two suicide bombers blew themselves up near the wall of the sprawling military area, a security official said on condition of anonymity, because he wasnt authorized to speak with reporters. After a breach in the wall, five to six more attackers attempted to enter the cantonment, but were eliminated, the security official said. The attack happened after sunset, when people would have been breaking their fast during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. Jaish Al-Fursan claimed responsibility for the attack, the third militant assault in Pakistan since Ramadan started Sunday. In a statement, the group said the source of the blasts were explosive-laden vehicles. Plumes of gray smoke rose into the air and gunshots continued after the two explosions, police officer Zahid Khan said. Four of those killed were children, hospital officials said. The victims lived close to the scene of the blasts. A spokesman for Bannu District Hospital, Muhammad Noman, said that the evening blasts badly damaged homes and other buildings. The roofs and walls collapsed and thats why we are receiving casualties, he said. Hospital director Dr. Ahmed Faraz Khan said: So far we have received 42 victims, 12 dead and 30 injured. A few of them are critical, but most are stable. All doctors, particularly surgeons and paramedical staff, have been called for duty as a medical emergency has been imposed. The blasts caused the roof of a nearby mosque to collapse while a number of worshippers were inside, rescue workers and provincial government spokesman Muhammad Ali Saif said. Rescue workers trying to free people from underneath the rubble said that they had retrieved the body of the mosques imam. Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif condemned the attack and expressed his grief over the loss of life. The chief minister of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Ali Amin Gandapur, ordered an inquiry. Militants have targeted Bannu several times. Last November, a suicide car bomb killed 12 troops and wounded several others at a security post. In July, a suicide bomber detonated his explosives-laden vehicle and other militants opened fire near the outer wall of the military facility. Source: AP --Agencies",

        "content": "Mount Lavinia Additional Magistrate Hemali Halpandeniya has assigned further investigations into the mysterious death of a journalists husband to the Criminal Investigation Department (CID). Accordingly, notice has been issued to the Director of the CID to appear before the court on March 18. The deceased has been identified as Agosthinuge Samarajeewa, a 60-year-old resident of Waidya Road in Dehiwala. It is reported that after his wife noticed her husband had not returned home after work on January 1, she went looking for him and later found him in critical condition with bruises at the Colombo South Teaching Hospital the following day, January 2. The injured person, who was in critical condition, succumbed to his injuries on the morning of January 3. Meanwhile, on the day of the incident, a former Air Force officer, who is the husband of a lawyer, had informed the 119 Police Emergency Hotline that a person was found lying in the garden of a house on Hill Street in Dehiwala, which is owned by his wife. Attorney-at-Law Geethma Fernando, presenting evidence on behalf of the aggrieved party, stated in court that that fact that the Dehiwala Police officers who arrived at the scene at around 11 p.m. to inspect the injured man had proceeded to wash him and changed his clothes instead of taking steps to hospitalize him immediately. The attorney also claimed that Dehiwala Police had not conducted a proper investigation into the incident. However, Dehiwala Police stated before the court that statements have been recorded from the homeowner and residents related to the incident. Accordingly, after considering the facts presented, the Additional Magistrate has entrusted the CID with conducting further investigations into the death, as the autopsy report identified the cause of death as assault with a blunt weapon, and as it would not be possible to expect the Dehiwala Police to conduct a fair investigation into the case. The case is scheduled to be heard again on March 18.",

        "content": "Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is likely to travel to Sri Lanka in April. The visit, according to Sri Lankan sources, is still firming up and could happen around 5th April, with focus on a range of issues, including connectivity and economic ties. The invitation for this visit was extended by Sri Lankan President Anura Kumara Dissanayake during his two-day trip to New Delhi in mid-December 2024. That was President Dissanayakes first overseas visit after being elected in September 2024. During the visit, the Indian government announced the conversion of 20 million in payments for seven completed Line of Credit projects into grants, easing Sri Lankas debt burden. The announcement builds on Delhis support to Colombo, worth 4 billion during the 2022 economic crisis the country faced. The Sri Lankan president assured that Sri Lanka would not allow its territory to be used in any manner detrimental to Indian interests, key remarks amid Indias concern over growing Chinese engagements in the Indian Ocean region. This will not be PM Modis first visit to Sri Lanka. He has previously visited the island nation multiple times, including in 2015, 2017, 2019 during his earlier terms. The 2015 visit, first bilateral trip by an Indian prime minister in several years, saw major announcements to firm up ties and a visit to Tamil-dominated Jaffna province. In May 2017, he was the chief guest for the first-ever International Vesak Day hosted by Sri Lanka. In 2019, Modi made a brief stopover in Sri Lanka following the Easter terror attacks, becoming the first world leader to visit after the tragedy, signalling solidarity with Sri Lanka during a time of crisis. Ties have several pillars including connectivity. On the connectivity front, a new ferry route between Indias Rameshwaram and Sri Lankas Talaimanner is being discussed. Another proposal that is on the table is a multi product petroleum pipeline that links Nagapattinam to Trincomalee, with Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) playing a key role. India is assisting Sri Lanka in adopting UPI for digital transactions, following its launch in February 2024 alongside Mauritius, something that enhances cross-border payments, especially for Indian tourists and businesses in Sri Lanka.

Following questioning by the CID this morning (05), she was arrested and is scheduled to be produced before the Kaduwela Magistrates Court later today. On February 14, the Attorney General filed indictments in the Colombo High Court against Yoshitha Rajapaksa and Daisy Forest Wickremesinghe under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act. The charges relate to their failure to disclose the source of funds used to acquire lands and properties in Sirimalwatta Uyana, Ratmalana, and Dehiwala, valued at over Rs. 8 billion in total, between 2012 and 2015. Yoshitha Rajapaksa, who was recently arrested in connection with this case, was released on bail by the Colombo Magistrates Court. Meanwhile, on February 11, the Kaduwela Magistrates Court imposed an overseas travel ban on Daisy Forest over the ongoing investigation. According to Sri Lanka Police, under the instructions from the Attorney General, Daisy Forest was named as a suspect in the money laundering case linked to a Rs. 59 million joint account held by Yoshitha Rajapaksa and Daisy Forest, for which Rajapaksa failed to provide a reasonable explanation regarding the source of earnings.",

        "content": "Minister of Trade Wasantha Samarasinghe says that substandard coconut oil, which is unsuitable for consumption, is available in the market. Responding to a question posed by Samagi Jana Balavegaya (SJB) MP Chaminda Wijesiri in Parliament today (05), the Minister confirmed that this has been identified in market sample testing conducted by the Consumer Affairs Authority (CAA). Commenting further on this matter, Samarasinghe added, The CAA has identified through market sample testing that substandard coconut oil, which is unfit for consumption, is available in the market. The Minister also highlighted that local producers are manufacturing and distributing substandard coconut oil in the market without proper understanding on the quality. He further pointed out that some producers intentionally create and release substandard products to the market with the aim of minimizing production costs and obtaining higher profits. Responding to a question raised by MP Wijesiri regarding the measures being taken by the government to prevent such substandard coconut oil from entering the market, Minister Samarasinghe added, This is another racket taking place in our country. They bring in both virgin (coconut oil) and the raw (coconut oil). The Minister also noted that the government has identified companies involved in these rackets, some of which only exist for 11 months and shut own before having to prepare year-end accounts. Minister Samarasinghe further stated that legal action will be taken against those involved in such operations, and they have already identified those responsible for bringing in coconut oil into Sri Lanka through customs.",

        "content": "The overseas travel ban imposed on Pastor Jerome Fernando has been lifted by court. The order was issued when the case filed against Fernando was taken up before the Colombo Fort Magistrates Court today (05). The court had previously imposed a foreign travel ban on Pastor Jerome Fernando in connection with the case filed against him for allegedly making derogatory statements about other religions. The controversial pastor was arrested on December 01, 2023 after a video of one of his sermons, containing alleged derogatory statements regarding other religions, went viral on social media. After months of controversy over his remarks, Fernando returned to the island on November 29, 2024. Pastor Jerome had initially provided a statement to the CID on November 30, 2024 for around eight hours. This was after the Court of Appeal issued an interim order on November 17, directing the CID not to arrest him upon his arrival in Sri Lanka. The order also mandated Pastor Fernando to record a statement with the CIDs Cyber Crime Investigation Division within 48 hours of his return. The Colombo Fort Magistrates Court granted bail to the self-styled prophet Jerome Fernando on January 03, 2024. Despite being granted bail, the court imposed travel restrictions on Pastor Jerome, prohibiting him from leaving the country, and the strict condition that he refrain from making any such statements in the future that could disturb religious harmony.",

        "title": "Trump vows to press ahead on reshaping America in speech to Congress",
        "date": "March 5, 2025 03:16 pm",
        "content": "US President Donald Trump vowed Tuesday to keep up his campaign of swift and unrelenting action in reorienting the nations economy, immigration and foreign policy in an unyielding address before Congress that left Democratic legislators to register their dissent with stone faces, placards calling out lies, and one legislators ejection. Trumps prime-time speech was the latest marker in his takeover of the nations capital, where the Republican-led House and Senate have done little to restrain the president as he and his allies work to slash the size of the federal government and remake Americas place in the world. The presidents address, clocking in at a record 99 minutes, added up to a defiant sales pitch for the policies that Trump promised during his campaign and leaned into during his first weeks back in office. Trump pledged to keep delivering sweeping change to rescue the nation from what he described as destruction and mistakes left by his predecessor. He seldom addressed his comments directly to the American people, who are trying to keep up with the recent upheaval, while repeatedly needling the Democratic lawmakers seated before him. Michigan Sen. Elissa Slotkin, who delivered the Democratic response following Trumps speech, allowed that America wants change, but theres a responsible way to make change and a reckless way, and we can make that change without forgetting who we are as a country and as a democracy. Emboldened after overcoming impeachments in his first term, outlasting criminal prosecutions in between his two administrations and getting a tight grip on the GOP-led Congress, Trump has embarked on a mission to dismantle parts of the federal government, remake the relationship with Americas allies and slap on tariffs that have sparked a North American trade war. It has been nothing but swift and unrelenting action, Trump said of his opening weeks in office. The people elected me to do the job, and I am doing it. Trump, who has billionaire adviser Elon Musk orchestrating his efforts to slash the size and scope of the federal government, said he is working to reclaim democracy from this unaccountable bureaucracy and threatened federal workers anew with firings if they resist his agenda. Musk, who was seated in the House gallery, received a pair of standing ovations from Republicans in the chamber, as Trump exaggerated and shared false claims about alleged government abuse uncovered by the Tesla and SpaceX founder and his team of disrupters. Trump repeated false claims that tens of millions of dead people over 100 years old are receiving Social Security payments, prompting some Democrats to shout, Not true! and Those are lies! Trump spoke at a critical juncture in his presidency, as voters who returned him to the White House on his promise to fix inflation are instead finding economic chaos. All the gains the SP 500 have made since Election Day are now gone, while consumer sentiment surveys show the public sees inflation as worsening. Trump seemed prepared to double down on his trade policies, which experts have warned will raise prices for consumers. Whatever they tariff us, we tariff them. Whatever they tax us, we tax them, Trump said. At the same time, he tried to ease concerns about the resulting price increases, saying, Therell be a little disturbance, but were okay with that. It wont be much. Trump said one of his very highest priorities was to rescue the economy and offer relief to working families. He promised to organize the federal government to lower costs on eggs and energy, blaming his Democratic predecessor Joe Biden for the situation and offering scant details of his own plans. Trump also called for the extension of his first-term tax cuts and additional federal funding for his border crackdown, including for his promised efforts at mass deportation of people in the U.S. illegally. He celebrated his crackdown on migration, saying, It turns all we really needed was a new president. Speaking about his promised tax cuts, Trump seemed to goad Democrats, saying: Im sure youre going to vote for those tax cuts. Because otherwise I dont believe the people will ever vote you into office. The backdrop was the new economic uncertainty unleashed after the president opened the day by placing stiff tariffs on imports from the countrys neighbors and closest trading partners. A 25 tax on goods from Canada and Mexico went into effect early Tuesday  ostensibly to secure greater cooperation to tackle fentanyl trafficking and illegal immigration  triggering immediate retaliation and sparking fears of a wider trade war. Trump also raised tariffs on goods from China to 20. Republicans were boisterous as Trump stepped to the lectern in the House, chanting USA! USA! as the president basked in the cheers. The GOP lawmakers were jubilant, having won a trifecta of the White House, Senate and House in the elections. However, they face the challenging task of delivering on Trumps agenda as well as avoiding a government shutdown later this month. Across the aisle, out-of-power Democrats set the tone early, with most remaining seated without applauding or making eye contact with Trump as he was introduced in the chamber. After several interruptions, House Speaker Mike Johnson jumped in and called for decorum to be restored in the chamber as Republicans shouted USA to drown out the cries from the other side of the aisle. Johnson then ordered Texas Rep. Al Green removed from the chamber. Its worth it to let people know that there are some people who are going to stand up to Trump, Green told reporters after being thrown out of the chamber. Other Democrats held up signs criticizing like Save Medicaid and Protect Veterans during Trumps remarks, seeking to drive public awareness to elements of Trumps agenda they believed might offer them a pathway back to the majority. Some Democrats chose to highlight the impact of Trumps actions by inviting fired federal workers as guests, including a disabled veteran from Arizona, a health worker from Maryland and a forestry employee who worked on wildfire prevention in California. Trump also used his speech to address his proposals for fostering peace in Ukraine and the Middle East, where he has unceremoniously upended the policies of the Biden administration in a matter of just weeks. On Monday, Trump ordered a freeze to U.S. military assistance to Ukraine, ending years of staunch American support for the country in fending off Russias invasion. Trump recited a letter he received earlier Tuesday from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, saying that the wartime president wants to come back to the table after a explosive Oval Office meeting last week broke down negotiations for a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine. Weve had serious discussions with Russia and have received strong signals that they are ready for peace, Trump said. Wouldnt that be beautiful? He also announced the arrest of a suspect in the 2021 suicide bombing at the Kabul airport that killed U.S. troops during the withdrawal from Afghanistan. Trumps 1 hour and 39 minute speech was the longest annual address a president has ever delivered to Congress, breaking Bill Clintons record of 1 hour and 28 minutes. Watching from the gallery with first lady Melania Trump were guests including 15-year-old Elliston Berry, of Aledo, Texas, who was the victim of an explicit deepfake image sent to classmates. Other White House guests included relatives of Corey Comperatore, the former Pennsylvania fire chief who was killed as he protected his family during an assassination attempt on Trump last summer. Republican lawmakers cheered the conclusion of Trumps address with chants that echoed his words after he was struck in the ear by a bullet: Fight! Fight! Fight! Source: AP --Agencies",

        "title": "Trump issues last warning to Hamas to release all remaining hostages held in Gaza",
        "date": "March 6, 2025 06:36 am",
        "content": "President Donald Trump on Wednesday issued what he called a last warning to Hamas to release all remaining hostages held in Gaza, directing a sharply worded message after the White House confirmed that he had recently dispatched an envoy for unprecedented direct talks with the militant group. Trump, in a statement on his Truth Social platform soon after meeting at the White House with eight former hostages, added that he was sending Israel everything it needs to finish the job. Release all of the Hostages now, not later, and immediately return all of the dead bodies of the people you murdered, or it is OVER for you, Trump said. Only sick and twisted people keep bodies, and you are sick and twisted! The pointed language from Trump came after the White House said Wednesday that U.S. officials have engaged in ongoing talks and discussions with Hamas officials, stepping away from a long-held U.S. policy of not directly engaging in the militant group. Confirmation of the talks in the Qatari capital of Doha come as the Israel-Hamas ceasefire remains in the balance. Its the first known direct engagement between the U.S. and Hamas since the State Department designated the group a foreign terrorist organization in 1997. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt declined to provide detail on the the substance of talks, but said President Donald Trump has authorized his envoys to talk to anyone. Egyptian and Qatari intermediaries have served as mediators with Hamas for the U.S. and Israel since the group launched its Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel that sparked the war. Look, dialogue and talking to people around the world to do whats in the best interest of the American people is something that the president ... believes is a good-faith effort to do whats right for the American people, she said. Leavitt added that Israel has been consulted about the direct engagement with Hamas officials, and noted that there are American lives at stake. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahus office offered a terse acknowledgement of the U.S.-Hamas talks. Israel has expressed to the United States its position regarding direct talks with Hamas, the prime ministers office said. Israeli officials say about 24 living hostages  including Edan Alexander, an American citizen  as well as the bodies of at least 35 others are believed to still be held in Gaza. Adam Boehler, Trumps nominee to be special envoy for hostage affairs, led the direct talks with Hamas. Boehler, founder and CEO of Rubicon Founders, a healthcare investment firm, was a lead negotiator on the Abraham Accords team during Trumps first term that strove to win broader recognition of Israel in the Arab world. The talks, which took place last month, focused mainly on the release of American hostages, and a potential end of the war without Hamas in power in Gaza, according to a Hamas official who was not authorized to comment publicly and spoke on the condition of anonymity. The official added that no progress was made but the step itself is promising and more talks are expected. Egyptian and Qatari mediators helped arrange the talks. The direct engagement comes as continuation of the Israel-Hamas ceasefire remains uncertain. Trump has signaled that he has no intentions of pushing Netanyahu away from a return to combat if Hamas doesnt agree to terms of a new ceasefire proposal, which the Israelis have billed as being drafted by U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff. The new plan would require Hamas to release half its remaining hostages  the militant groups main bargaining chip  in exchange for a ceasefire extension and a promise to negotiate a lasting truce. Israel made no mention of releasing more Palestinian prisoners, a key component of the first phase. Trump on Wednesday welcomed eight former hostages  Iair Horn, Omer Shem Tov, Eli Sharabi, Keith Siegel, Aviva Siegel, Naama Levy, Doron Steinbrecher and Noa Argamani  to the White House. The President listened intently to their heartbreaking stories, Leavitt said. The hostages thanked President Trump for his steadfast efforts to bring all of the hostages home. The talks between U.S. and Hamas officials were first reported earlier Wednesday by the news site Axios. Leavitt, the White House press secretary, is one of three administration officials who face a lawsuit from The Associated Press on First- and Fifth-Amendment grounds. The AP says the three are punishing the news agency for editorial decisions they oppose. The White House says the AP is not following an executive order to refer to the Gulf of Mexico as the Gulf of America. Source: AP --Agencies",

        "title": "Hollywood actor writes off 1m of debt for 900 people",
        "date": "March 6, 2025 07:06 am",
        "content": "Hollywood actor Michael Sheen has written off 1m-worth of peoples debts, using 100,000 of his own money. Sheen started a debt acquisition company to help 900 people in south Wales. It has been documented in a new Channel 4 show called Michael Sheens Secret Million Pound Giveaway, due to air next week - five months after the closure of Port Talbots last blast furnace, which marked the end of traditional steelmaking in south Wales. The show aims to reveal how some banks and finance companies profit from societys most vulnerable. Sheen said he did not have 100,000 to throw around and therefore wanted the project to be effective. Despite initial doubts, an encounter with a woman in a Port Talbot cafe who shared the story of steelworkers in tears losing their jobs, convinced him to keep going. It comes two months after Sheen announced he was funding a new theatre company to fill the gap left by the folding of National Theatre Wales. In 2021, Sheen declared himself a not-for-profit actor, pledging to use all the money he earns for good causes. The 56-year-old, who has starred in films such as FrostNixon and The Damned United, also sold his houses to make sure the 2019 Homeless World Cup went ahead in Cardiff. Appearing on the One Show on Tuesday, the actor explained how exactly the system of debts work. It sees peoples debts get put into a bundle, with a debt-buying company then able to buy those bundles at a lower price. Despite the money being owed by people remaining the same, the companies that own the debt can then sell them for less and less money. Sheen said he was able to set up a debt acquisition company with 100,000 of his own money to buy 1m worth of debt because it had come down in value. Although the system was bizarre and he initially had no idea how it worked, Sheen said it seemed like a good thing to do. The company was not set up in Sheens name and he had to be at arms length from it. He did not know the identity of peoples debts he paid off, he only knew where they lived and the kind of debt it was. Sheen added: I would never know who they are - I still dont know who they are. During the making of the documentary, the process became far more complicated than he anticipated. I thought I would only work on this for a few weeks or a month or something, and it turned into two years, because we had to do it secretly, he said. Sheen added that setting up the company took so long that at a one point he felt like he wasnt going to be able to keep doing it. His mindset changed after filming in a cafe in his hometown of Port Talbot as the local steelworks prepared to close. The woman who worked at the cafe we were filming in told me the story of the men sitting on every table in tears, who were losing their jobs, he said. And I just thought - then, it really hits home, I just thought anything I can do to help. The hour-long documentary will air on Channel 4 on Monday 10 March - five months after the last remaining blast furnace was closed in Port Talbot - which brought an end to the traditional method of steelmaking in south Wales. As a result, Tata Steel announced that 2,800 jobs were going to be cut which created uncertainty and stress for many families. Currently, Sheen confirmed that he has helped 900 people with their debts across south Wales. He added that due to the stigma around discussing money, some people might not even realise their debts have been paid off, and therefore he urged people to check their accounts.

        "title": "Tiny island nation sells citizenship to save itself from rising seas",
        "date": "March 6, 2025 09:29 am",
        "content": "Citizenship of Nauru, an island nation spanning just 8 square miles in the southwest Pacific Ocean, can be yours for 105,000. The tiny, low-lying island has launched a golden passport initiative with the aim of raising money to fund climate action. Nauru faces an existential threat from rising sea levels, storm surges and coastal erosion as the planet warms. But the worlds third smallest country lacks the resources to protect itself from a climate crisis disproportionately driven by wealthy countries. The government says selling citizenship will help raise the funds needed for a plan to move 90 of the islands around 12,500-strong population onto higher ground and build an entirely new community. Golden passports are not new but they are controversial; history is littered with examples of them being exploited for criminal actions. Yet as developing countries struggle to get the money they need to deal with escalating climate impacts  a funding gap likely to be exacerbated by the US withdrawal from global climate action  they are being forced to find new ways to raise cash. While the world debates climate action, we must take proactive steps to secure our nations future, Naurus President David Adeang told CNN. The passports will cost a minimum of 105,000, but will be prohibited for people with certain criminal histories. A Nauru passport offers visa-free access to 89 countries including the United Kingdom, Hong Kong, Singapore and the United Arab Emirates. Few of these new passport holders are likely to ever even visit remote Nauru, but citizenship allows people to lead global lives, said Kirstin Surak, associate professor of political sociology at the London School of Economics and the author of The Golden Passport: Global Mobility for Millionaires. This can be particularly useful for those with more restrictive passports, she told CNN. For Nauru, this program is being pitched as a chance to secure the future of the island, which has a difficult, dark history. Nauru was strip mined for phosphate from the early 1900s. For nearly a century, the landscape was gouged by miners, leaving the center of the island a near barren landscape of jagged rocks. It has left around 80 of the island uninhabitable, meaning most people now live clustered along the coastlines, exposed to sea level rise, which has been increasing here at a faster rate than global average. Once the phosphate ran out, Nauru looked for new revenue sources. Since the early 2000s, it has served as an offshore detention site for refugees and migrants attempting to settle in Australia  a program scaled back after detainee deaths. Now, the island is at the center of a controversial plan to mine the deep sea for materials for the green transition. Nauru was even in the sights of now-disgraced cryptocurrency entrepreneur Sam Bankman-Fried, who floated a plan to buy the island and build a bunker to survive an apocalypse, according to 2023 filings in a lawsuit against him. For the people who live there, however, Nauru feels anything but future-proofed. A lot of people residing on the coast have already lost land  some have had their entire houses engulfed by king tides and they have lost everything, Tyrone Deiye, a Nauruan national and a researcher at Monash Business School in Australia, said in a statement. Selling citizenship has the potential to make an absolutely enormous economic impact for micro-states like Nauru, LSEs Surak said. Nauru expects to make around 5.6 million from the program in its first year, eventually scaling that to around 42 million a year. It will be built up gradually as we assess for any unintended consequences or negative impact, said Edward Clark, CEO of Nauru Economic and Climate Resilience Citizenship Program. Ultimately they hope the program will make up 19 of total government revenue. The success of the program will depend on how revenues are channeled into the country, and what they are used to do, Surak said. That means vetting and transparency on where the funds go, and preventing people who would otherwise be prohibited from being granted passports from paying officials off the books to get one, she added. An earlier program to sell citizenship in the mid-1990s was mired in scandal, including the 2003 arrest in Malaysia of two alleged Al Qaida terrorists carrying Nauru passports. The government says the programs vetting will be stringent and exclude those from countries designated as high risk by the United Nations, including Russia and North Korea. Partnerships with international organizations including the World Bank will provide expertise and oversight, said President Adeang. Nauru is not the first country to look to fund climate action by selling passports. The Caribbean nation of Dominica, which has been selling citizenship since 1993, recently said it was using some of the proceeds to fund its commitment to be the worlds first climate resilient country by 2030. It may be a route other countries consider as the burden of dealing with the costs of climate change far outweigh their economic resources, all while international climate funding appears to be drying up. Nauru highlights the opportunities for climate vulnerable countries to become testing grounds for climate innovation, Clark said. Source: CNN --Agencies",

        "content": "The National Cancer Control Programme (NCCP) has reported a rise in colon and rectal cancer patients, commonly known as colorectal cancer (CRC), among both adults and children in Sri Lanka. Speaking at a press conference held at the Health Promotion Bureau, Deputy Director of the NCCP, Dr. Shreeni Alahapperuma, attributed this increase to unhealthy habits and a lack of an active lifestyle. If we look back 10 years, the data on colorectal cancer (CRC) in Sri Lanka and around the world was very low. But now, it has reached third place globally, as well as in Sri Lanka. However, there are ways to prevent colorectal cancer. The main causes are poor dietary habits, lack of physical activity, and aging, Dr. Alahapperuma stated. She further explained that while aging itself does not directly cause the disease, the accumulation of risk factors over time makes it more prevalent among older individuals. In Sri Lanka, approximately 1,500 men and 1,500 women are diagnosed with colorectal cancer each year, she added.",

        "content": "The Chinese government has outlined its major economic goals and policy directions for 2025 in a work report submitted Wednesday to the national legislature for deliberation. China has set its economic growth target at around 5 percent and an annual increase in the consumer price index of around 2 percent in 2025. The country will issue a total of 1.3 trillion yuan (about 182 billion U.S. dollars) in ultra-long special treasury bonds, marking an increase of 300 billion yuan from last year. Chinas new government debt will total 11.86 trillion yuan in 2025, up by 2.9 trillion yuan compared to the previous year, which will facilitate a significantly higher level of fiscal spending, according to the work report. Additionally, China plans to issue 4.4 trillion yuan in local government special-purpose bonds in 2025, reflecting an increase of 500 billion yuan from last year. To further stimulate the economy, China will implement monetary policy adjustments, including cutting required reserve ratios and interest rates when appropriate. The government will also issue 500 billion yuan in special treasury bonds to support large state-owned commercial banks in replenishing capital. Structural monetary policy instruments will be refined and expanded to provide stronger support for the real estate sector and the stock market. China will launch special initiatives to boost consumption, including the issuance of 300 billion yuan in ultra-long special treasury bonds to support consumer goods trade-in programs. The country aims to advance integrated and clustered development of strategic emerging industries while fostering new and future industries. Furthermore, it will deepen comprehensive reforms in investment and financing within the capital market, encouraging the entry of long- and medium-term capital. The report emphasizes Chinas commitment to promoting the well-regulated development of the platform economy, leveraging its role in driving innovation, expanding consumption, and stabilizing employment. It also highlights support for the growth of unicorn and gazelle companies in 2025. To ensure financial security, China will enhance contingency plans to effectively manage external shocks, safeguarding the stability of its financial system. The report underscores the governments efforts to encourage private investment, guiding more capital toward major infrastructure and public welfare projects. China has set the surveyed urban unemployment rate at around 5.5 percent for 2025, which is necessary for providing more support to stabilize employment, the report stated. Source: ECNS --Agencies",

        "title": "Archaeologists uncovered a cache of 1.5 million-year-old bone tools",
        "date": "March 6, 2025 09:50 am",
        "content": "Archaeologists have uncovered a collection of bone tools in northern Tanzania that were shaped by ancient human ancestors 1.5 million years ago, making them the oldest known bone tools by about 1 million years, according to new research. Researchers have unearthed stone tools that date back to at least 3.3 million years ago, but before this discovery, the oldest known bone tools were found at European sites believed to be 250,000 to 500,000 years old. The 27 fragments of limb bones, most from hippopotamuses and elephants, show evidence of having been sharpened and shaped, likely with the aid of stone pieces. Some of the bones reach up to nearly 15 inches (38 centimeters) long. The bone tools, which all appear to have been systematically produced in the same style as one another, were found in Tanzanias Olduvai Gorge. The site is also where archaeologists have previously unearthed artifacts related to some of the first stone tools crafted by early hominins, or human ancestors who walked upright. The new findings, presented in a study published Wednesday in the journal Nature, suggest that our ancient human relatives applied the same techniques they used to make stone tools to specific bones they selected from large mammals. Researchers believe the tools are evidence that hominins long ago were capable of abstract reasoning, or the ability to think critically by identifying patterns and making connections. This expansion of technological potential indicates advances in the cognitive abilities and mental structures of these hominins, who knew how to incorporate technical innovations by adapting their knowledge of stone work to the manipulation of bone remains, said lead study author Dr. Ignacio de la Torre, scientist at the Spanish National Research Councils Institute of History and codirector of the Olduvai Gorge Archaeology Project, in a statement. Windows into human evolution Olduvai Gorge is in East Africa, which is home to some of the earliest evidence of both tool production and use among early human ancestors. It is part of a UNESCO World Heritage site often referred to as the Cradle of Humankind and is renowned for its unparalleled contribution to our understanding of early human evolution, said study coauthor Jackson Njau, associate professor in the department of Earth and atmospheric sciences at Indiana University. As a Tanzanian native, Ive been captivated since my high school days by the groundbreaking discoveries made at renowned Olduvai Gorge site in northern Tanzania, Njau said. The iconic work of the famous archaeologists Drs. Louis and Mary Leakey, which discovered early human fossils  and the worlds first human stone tools ignited my fascination and fueled the dreams of countless young students, myself included, who aspired to follow in their footsteps. The site has a timeline spanning 2 million to 20,000 years ago, and researchers have uncovered the remains of ancient human ancestors such as Homo habilis, Homo erectus and prehistoric Homo sapiens, or modern humans, he said. The archaeological record also includes cultural advancements and the evolution of toolmaking, Njau added. During the Oldowan age, a time period named for stone artifacts found in the gorge, ancient humans used tools created by striking one rock against another to chip off flakes, a process that resulted in a basic shape. These simple tools were made between 2.7 million and 1.5 million years ago. The hand ax emerged during a shift in early human innovation about 1.7 million years ago in a time called the Acheulean age that lasted until about 150,000 years ago. The large and heavy, pointed almond-shaped stones required complex technical ability called knapping, or chipping away small flakes to create sharp edges, for their production, de la Torre said. Ancient craftsmanship on display The Olduvai Gorge bone tools were first spotted in 2018 during excavations carried out between 2015 and 2022. Researchers narrowed in on a specific gully in the gorge after first finding hominin teeth on the surface during a field survey between 2010 and 2011, which Njao helped lead with Robert Blumenschine, professor emeritus of evolutionary anthropology at Rutgers University in New Jersey. Elephant bones resulted in the largest tools, ranging from 8.6 to 15 inches (22 to 38 centimeters) long and 3.1 inches to 6 inches (8 to 15 centimeters) wide, while the hippo bones made for slightly smaller tools spanning from 7 to 12 inches (18 to 30 centimeters) long and 2.3 to 3.1 inches (6 to 8 centimeters) wide. The same knapping techniques were applied to bones made exclusively from the dense, strong long bones of large animals. The tools, mainly made from bones freshly collected from carcasses, shed new light on the almost unknown world of early hominin bone technology, the study authors said. The tools show evidence that their creators carefully worked the bones, chipping off flakes to create useful shapes, said study coauthor Dr. Renata Peters, associate professor at the University College Londons Institute of Archaeology, in a statement. We were excited to find these bone tools from such an early timeframe. It means that human ancestors were capable of transferring skills from stone to bone, a level of complex cognition that we havent seen elsewhere for another million years. The bones add new evidence that early hominin cultures were experiencing a technological transition about 1.5 million years ago, de la Torre said. Prior to our discovery, the technological transition from the Oldowan to the Acheulean was limited to the study of stone tools, de la Torre said. This discovery leads us to assume that early humans significantly expanded their technological options, which until then were limited to the production of stone tools and now allowed new raw materials to be incorporated into the repertoire of potential artifacts. An advanced comprehension of toolmaking and the ability to apply it to different materials suggests that ancient human ancestors had greater cognitive abilities than previously believed, the researchers said. New mysteries emerge Previous discoveries of bone tools have occurred in isolated instances across Europe and Asia, but the 27 bones found at Olduvai Gorge seem to imply mass production, the study authors said. While the bone tool kits found later in Europe, dated to 400,000 years ago, are much more refined, the Olduvai Gorge tools were more effective for heavy-duty tasks, Njau said. While there is no direct evidence to show how the tools were used, the researchers said they believe hominins employed them to strip down animal carcasses for food and to produce new tools. The researchers also dont know which specific human ancestor species made the tools because no hominin remains were found with the bones. But previous research conducted at the site has suggested that Homo erectus and the hominin species Paranthropus boisei lived in the region. Human ancestors were likely inspired to make tools from bone due the abundance of animal carcasses available across the landscape, especially during seasonal migrations, Njau said, while rocks may have been harder to come by depending on where the hominins lived. But bone tools are scarcer in the archaeological record because organic material such as bone can break down more easily, he said. Dr. Briana Pobiner, paleoanthropologist and research scientist in the Human Origins Program at the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History, said the study underscores the importance that tools made from materials other than stone had for our ancestors  and how these artifacts can be essentially archaeologically invisible. Pobiner was not involved in the study. That there is a collection of 27 bone tools, and not just one or a few, suggests that hominins 1.5 million years ago (at least in this one place) were able to successfully transfer their knowledge of how to knap stone to knapping bone, Pobiner said. To me, this signals that toolmaking was becoming an increasingly important part of our ancestors lives. And once again, we should be looking in museum collections for more evidence of hominin behavior  in this case, bone tool manufacture  earlier than we might have previously expected.

        "date": "March 6, 2025 09:58 am",
        "content": "Intel won the dismissal of a shareholder lawsuit accusing the chipmaker of fraudulently concealing problems in its foundry business, leading to job cuts and a dividend suspension that wiped out more than 32 billion of market value in one day. In a decision made public on Tuesday, U.S. District Judge Trina Thompson in San Francisco rejected claims that Intel took too long to reveal a 7 billion fiscal 2023 operating loss linked to its business of making chips for outside customers. Intel did not disclose the loss until last April, when it made changes to how it reported financial results. But the judge said shareholders incorrectly attributed the 7 billion loss to the Intel Foundry Services business unit, and were not misled into believing the units reported results included results for the entire Internal Foundry Model. Thompson also said statements last March by former Chief Executive Patrick Gelsinger that Intel was enjoying significant traction and growing demand for our foundry offering were not misleading because they concerned specific customers rather than overall revenue, which was falling. Lawyers for the shareholders did not immediately respond on Wednesday to a request for comment. Intel declined to comment. Thompson said the plaintiffs may file an amended complaint. The lawsuit accused Intel of inflating its stock price from January 25 to August 1, 2024, when Intel posted a 1.61 billion quarterly loss and said it would more than 15,000 people and suspend its dividend to help save 10 billion in 2025. Intels share price fell 26 the next day, resulting in the 32 billion loss of market value. The Santa Clara, California-based company has struggled to fend off competition from rival chipmakers and benefit from growth in artificial intelligence. Its rivals include Nvidia , Advanced Micro Devices , Samsung Electronics and Taiwans TSMC . Intel ousted Gelsinger in December. The case is In re Intel Corp Securities Litigation, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, No. 24-02683. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "date": "March 6, 2025 12:52 pm",
        "content": "The Attorney General has informed the Court of Appeal that a program will be formulated to reduce air pollution in Jaffna. Appearing on behalf of the Attorney General, the Deputy Solicitor General made this announcement when a petition filed by Dr. Uma Sugi Nadarajah, a resident of Jaffna, seeking an order be issued to the Minister of Environment and other respondents to formulate a necessary program to reduce the rising air pollution in the Jaffna peninsula, was taken up today (March 6). This petition was taken up before the two-member judge bench, comprising Acting President of the Court of Appeal Mohamed Lafar Tahir, and Justice Sarath Dissanayake. The Court of Appeal had previously ordered the Central Environmental Authority (CEA) to conduct a month-long survey on air quality in the Jaffna peninsula and submit a report. In accordance with that order, the relevant survey report was submitted to the court through the Attorney General. Appearing for the petitioner, Attorney-at-Law Ravindranath Dabare, stated in the court that, upon examining the survey report, it was revealed that the air in the Jaffna peninsula contained harmful components that exceeded the standard levels. The Deputy Solicitor General stated that the government plans to implement a program to reduce air pollution across the island, including in the Jaffna peninsula. The Deputy Solicitor General informed the court that a large expenditure would be required for this, and that plans have been made to obtain funds from foreign institutions and organizations to carry out the project. Accordingly, the court ordered the parties to report on the progress of these proceedings in the future. Later, the petition was ordered to be recalled on July 5. The petitioner claims that the air quality in the Jaffna peninsula has declined due to various harmful substances being discharged into the peninsula, as well as harmful components coming from neighboring countries such as India. The petition also points out that, despite complaints submitted to the responsible authorities, no necessary measures have been implemented to restore air quality to normal levels. Therefore, the petitioner has also requested the Court of Appeal to issue an order to the relevant authorities to formulate a program to reduce air pollution in the Jaffna peninsula.",

        "title": "I am sending Israel everything it needs to finish the job in Gaza, Trump warns Hamas",
        "date": "March 6, 2025 02:22 pm",
        "content": "President Donald Trump has put out another dire threat to Hamas, after the White House confirmed direct talks with the group as part an of an effort to finally secure the release of hostages and bodies of the deceased. Shalom Hamas means Hello and Goodbye - You can choose. Release all of the Hostages now, not later, and immediately return all of the dead bodies of the people you murdered, or it is OVER for you, Trump wrote on his Truth Social site. Only sick and twisted people keep bodies, and you are sick and twisted! I am sending Israel everything it needs to finish the job, not a single Hamas member will be safe if you dont do as I say. I have just met with your former Hostages whose lives you have destroyed. This is your last warning! Trump also told leadership of the terror group to leave Gaza now ... while you still have a chance. He added: Also, to the People of Gaza: A beautiful Future awaits, but not if you hold Hostages. If you do, you are DEAD! Make a SMART decision. RELEASE THE HOSTAGES NOW, OR THERE WILL BE HELL TO PAY LATER! Trump issued similar warnings last month, saying there would be all hell to pay if the group, which the U.S. government classified as a terrorist organization, did not send home hostages. Trumps angry threat came hours after a report that the administration was conducting secret talks with Hamas in an effort to release American hostages seized during the bloody October 7 terror attack on Israel. The White House said U.S. hostage affairs envoy Adam Boehler had the authority to talk directly with Hamas, despite longstanding policy against negotiating with designated terrorist organizations. The two sides met in Doha, where prior cease fire and hostage talks had occurred, gut not directly between the parties. U.S. and Israeli negotiators had negotiated instead through third party Arab leaders. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt confirmed those talks when asked about them. First of all, the special envoy who engaged in this negotiation does have the authority to talk to anyone. Israel was consulted on this matter, Leavitt said. And look  dialog and talking to people around the world to do whats in the best interest of the American people, is something that the American people. She wouldnt answer directly when asked if the talks also related to Trumps stated plan to rebuild and take over Gaza in a plan critics have called Gaza-lago. These are ongoing talks and discussions. Im not going to detail them here, that are American lines at stake. On February 11, Trump warned all hell is going to break loose if the group did not release all remaining hostages that week. In response, a Hamas spokesman lashed out at the US President and said there was no place for the language of threats. Sami Abu Zuhri, a senior spokesperson for the terror group known for its tight stranglehold over the Gaza Strip, boldly claimed Trumps comments did nothing but make negotiations for the end of the war harder. The language of threats has no value and further complicates matters, Zuhri remarked. He added that Trump needed to remember that there is an agreement that must be respected by both parties and this is the only way to return the prisoners. A few days later, Hamas released American-Israeli Sagui Dekel-Chen, 36 and two other hostages. Edan Alexander of Tenafly, New Jersey, is thought to be the last living American hostage, in an ordeal that has extended beyond 500 days. He appeared in a Hamas propaganda video in November 2024. Israel says four other American hostages died in captivity. Israel says 24 living hostages remain, along with the bodies of 35 others. The threats come days after Secretary of State Marco Rubio invoked emergency authority to send an additional 4 billion in security assistance to Israel. Trump also met with hostages released from captivity on Wednesday. Today, President Trump took time to meet with eight of the released hostages from Gaza, Leavitt said. The President listened intently to their heartbreaking stories. The hostages thanked President Trump for his steadfast efforts to bring all of the hostages home. They were Iair Horn, Omer Shem Tov, Eli Sharabi, Keith Siegel, Aviva Siegel, Naama Levy, Doron Steinbrecher, and Noa Argamani. This comes after Trump promoted a controversial vision for what his Riviera of the Middle East plan for the Gaza Strip could look like when the war between Israel and Hamas has ended. The President laid out an extraordinary plan at a press conference with Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu in February, stating: The US will take over the Gaza Strip, and we will do a job with it too. Trumps proposal was met with global criticism by both lawmakers and analysts who fear the plan would forcibly displace Gazas population of two million, while US critics wondered if the Presidents vision would plunge the nation into the potentially bloody role of occupying power. Aaron David Miller, a Middle East expert who advised secretaries of state across multiple administrations of both parties, said the immediate reaction among global lawmakers and leaders across the region was one of revulsion. But on February 25, Trump seemed to further promote the plan by posting a 35-second video to his Truth Social account that began with the question: Gaza 2025: Whats Next? It is unclear who created the video. The AI-generated video - in a series of bold, gaudy images - shows a Trump hotel, a giant golden statue of Trump, and a child holding a Trump balloon among resplendent beach-front resort complexes. First Buddy Elon Musk is seen tossing around cash to visitors and children, while Trump dances with a belly dancer and drinks cocktails with Netanyahu. The video has created uproar online with X users quickly branding it as absolutely horrifying and filth on a world stage, while others argued that it is time for people to start taking Trumps plan for Gaza more seriously. The White House responded to the criticism in a statement to DailyMail.com: As President Trump has said, Gaza in its current state is unhabitable for any human being. President Trump is a visionary, and his plan to have the United States involved in Gazas rebuilding will allow for Palestinians to resettle in new, beautiful communities while improving conditions in the region for generations to come.
