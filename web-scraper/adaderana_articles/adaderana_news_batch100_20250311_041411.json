        "title": "Integrating modern technology, including AI, crucial for health sector advancement: President",
        "date": "March 23, 2024 05:58 pm",
        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe, raising concerns about the brain drain of medical professionals, said that approximately 30 - 40 out of every 100 doctors or nurses trained in the country opt to leave, a circumstance which he deemed unfavourable for the nation. Speaking about this concerning trend in the healthcare sector of Sri Lanka, the Head of State stressed that it is incumbent upon all individuals to enhance healthcare services within the nation, which boasts some of the worlds highest standards in medical care, and to actively contribute to the countrys economic prosperity. Wickremesinghe made these remarks while attending the inauguration ceremony of the accident and emergency care unit of Point Pedro Base Hospital. This facility was constructed as part of the Government of the Netherlands Development Related Infrastructure Investment Vehicle (DRIVE), relief loan scheme and officially vested in the public on Friday (March 22). The DRIVE is a subsidy programme established by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Netherlands to support public infrastructure projects in developing countries which contribute to the countrys advancement. The President stated that he has instructed Sir John Kotelawala Defence University to augment its recruitment efforts to fulfil the requirements in the medical and nursing fields. Additionally, he underscored the importance of enhancing facilities to support the training programs in these areas. Meanwhile, Wickremesinghe noted that for the Faculty of Medicine, National School of Business Management (NSBM) Green University has been granted authorization to operate a teaching hospital, while Lyceum Campus has expressed interest in this endeavour as well. Furthermore, the President emphasized the importance of integrating modern technology, including Artificial Intelligence (AI), into the healthcare sector of the country to ensure the upkeep of contemporary medical systems. The President expressed gratitude to the Government of the Netherlands for extending this facility to the communities of Jaffna and Point Pedro. A sum of LKR 4 billion has been allocated through the Government of the Netherlands DRIVE Concessional Loan Scheme for the enhancement of Point Pedro Base Hospitals infrastructure including Accident  Emergency unit (AE), Preliminary Care Unit (PCU), Radiology Development (X-Ray, Ultrasound Scanner and CT Scanner), Intensive Care Unit (ICU), Operation Theatres, Neonatal ICU, Premature Baby Care Unit (PBCU), Surgical Ward, Maternity Ward, Central Sterile Supply Division (CSSD)Dialysis Unit and Laboratory. This funding has facilitated the advancement of modern healthcare facilities within the hospital premises. Following the unveiling of the memorial plaque and the inauguration of the emergency unit, the President embarked on an inspection tour and engaged in amicable discussions with the hospital personnel. Moreover, the President extended tokens of appreciation to Sri Lankas Dutch Ambassador Bonnie Horbach and Managing Director of VAMED Paul de Bruin. Additionally, a commemorative gift was bestowed upon President Wickremesinghe. Addressing the gathering, Health State Minister Dr. Sitha Arambepola highlighted the significance of the development initiatives at Point Pedro Base Hospital, considering it a notable milestone in advancing healthcare services within the Northern Province. She expressed gratitude to the Government of the Netherlands and the Netherlands Embassy in Sri Lanka for their invaluable support and financial assistance extended under the DRIVE project. Governor of the Northern Province, P.S.M Charles emphasized the importance of utilizing the modern healthcare facilities at Point Pedro Base Hospital efficiently and effectively for the advancement of healthcare services across the nation. Furthermore, the governor urged the health authorities of both the Provincial Government and Central Government of the Northern Province to collaborate closely to maximize the utilization of this hospital for the welfare of the public. Bonnie Horbach, Ambassador of the Kingdom of the Netherlands to Sri Lanka, emphasized that fostering equal rights for all Sri Lankans is integral to the reconciliation process, beginning with fundamental rights like access to healthcare and safety. Approximately six years ago, VAMED entered into an agreement with the Ministry of Health to develop four hospitals in the Northern Province. The estimated total construction value for these four hospitals is 16 million Euros, with a decision made to provide a grant of 25 of that amount, which is 4 million Euros, Mrs. Horbach stated. She observed that due to the challenges and economic crisis brought about by the COVID pandemic, the Government of the Netherlands opted to raise the percentage of grants from the total development cost to 35. This increase demonstrates the Government of the Netherlands dedication to improving healthcare services in the Northern Province of Sri Lanka. Minister Douglas Devananda, State Ministers Angajan Ramanathan and Kader Masthan, Member of Parliament Dharlingam Siddharthan, former State Minister Vijayakala Maheswaran, Senior Adviser to the President on National Security and Chief of the Presidential Staff Sagala Ratnayaka, Secretary to the President Saman Ekanayake, hospital staff, and various others were also present at this gathering. Meanwhile, the inauguration of the Farm to Gate web application, developed on the directives of Northern Province Governor to boost business opportunities also took place at Palali Air Force Base, spearheaded by President Ranil Wickremesinghe, on Friday. The Farm to Gate platform aims to empower farmers and small and medium enterprises across the country by providing access to broader markets, ensuring fair prices and benefits for their produce, and establishing direct connections between small-scale producers and consumers. This initiative is designed to eliminate the influence of intermediaries and strengthen the economic independence of farmers, gardeners, and small-scale entrepreneurs. --PMD",

        "content": "The Bill gazetted on 09 February 2024 by the government in order to amend Chapter 19 of the Penal Code regarding the age of a girl to have sexual relations of her own interest, will be withdrawn, says Minister of Justice, Prison Affairs and Constitutional Reform Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe. According to the amendments made to the Penal Code in 1995, even if a victim under 16 years of age has sexual relations of their own free will, it is considered rape. However, the proposed amendment to the Penal Code by the Justice Minister sought to lower the age of sexual consent to 14 years. Nevertheless, speaking to the media following an event held in Colombo today (23), Rajapakshe stated that he has informed the Attorney General that the draft would not be proceeded with and that it would be withdrawn from the Parliament. Several individuals have approached me requesting the suspension of the passing of this Bill. I have conveyed to them that further discussions must ensue, the Minister said. When the draft Bill was challenged before the Supreme Court, I informed the Attorney General that we would not proceed with it. Instead, discussions will be held with the concerned parties, and a decision will be made following these discussions. For the time being, it will be withdrawn from Parliament, he added.",

Furthermore, the statement mentions that this decision was communicated to the Committee on Public Finance (COPF) on 16th March 2024, prior to and independent of the recommendations made by COPF.

        "title": "Moscow massacre: Putin says gunmen tried to escape to Ukraine, death toll above 130",
        "date": "March 23, 2024 10:09 pm",
        "content": "Russian authorities arrested the four men suspected of carrying out the attack on a suburban Moscow concert hall that killed at least 133 people and believe they were headed to Ukraine, President Vladimir Putin said Saturday during an address to the nation. Kyiv, meanwhile, strongly denied any involvement in Fridays attack on the Crocus City Hall music venue in Krasnogorsk, which the Islamic State groups affiliate in Afghanistan claimed responsibility for in a statement posted in social media channels linked to the group. Kyiv accused Putin and other Russian politicians of falsely linking Ukraine to the assault in order to stoke fervor in Russias war in Ukraine, which recently entered its third year. A U.S. intelligence official told The Associated Press that U.S. agencies had confirmed that IS was responsible for the assault and had previously warned Moscow that an attack could be imminent. Putin said authorities have detained a total of 11 people in the attack, which also injured scores of concertgoers and left the venue a smoldering ruin. He called it a bloody, barbaric terrorist act and said Russian authorities captured the four suspected gunmen as they were trying to escape to Ukraine through a window prepared for them on the Ukrainian side of the border. Putin also said that additional security measures have been imposed throughout Russia, and he declared Sunday a day of mourning. The attack, the deadliest in Russia in years, is a major embarrassment to the Russian leader and happened just days after he cemented his grip on the country for another six years in a vote that followed the harshest crackdown on dissent since the Soviet times. Some commentators on Russian social media questioned how authorities, who have relentlessly suppressed any opposition activities and muzzled independent media, failed to prevent the attack despite the U.S. warnings. The attack came two weeks after the U.S. embassy in Moscow issued a notice urging Americans to avoid crowded places in view of imminent plans by extremists to target large Moscow gatherings, including concerts. The warning was repeated by several other Western embassies. Investigators on Saturday were combing through the charred wreckage of the hall for more victims, and authorities said the death toll could still rise. Hundreds of people stood in line in Moscow early Saturday to donate blood and plasma, Russias health ministry said. We faced not just a thoroughly and cynically prepared terror attack, but a well-prepared and organized mass murder of peaceful innocent people, Putin said. His claim that the attackers tried to flee to Ukraine followed comments by Russian lawmakers who pointed the finger at Ukraine immediately after the attack. But Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, denied any involvement. Ukraine has never resorted to the use of terrorist methods, he posted on X. Everything in this war will be decided only on the battlefield. Ukraines foreign ministry accused Moscow of using the attack to try to stoke fervor for its war efforts. We consider such accusations to be a planned provocation by the Kremlin to further fuel anti-Ukrainian hysteria in Russian society, create conditions for increased mobilization of Russian citizens to participate in the criminal aggression against our country and discredit Ukraine in the eyes of the international community, the ministry said in a statement. Images shared by Russian state media Saturday showed emergency vehicles still gathered outside the ruins of Crocus City Hall, which could hold more than 6,000 people and has hosted many big events, including the 2013 Miss Universe beauty pageant that featured Donald Trump and others. On Friday, crowds had gathered for a concert by the Russian rock band Picnic. Videos posted online showed gunmen in the venue shooting civilians at point-blank range. Russian news reports cited authorities and witnesses as saying the attackers threw explosive devices that started the fire, which eventually consumed the building and caused its roof to collapse. Dave Primov, who survived the attack, described the chaos to the AP as concertgoers rushed to leave the building: People began to panic, started to run and collided with each other. Some fell down and others trampled on them. Messages of outrage, shock and support for the victims and their families have streamed in from around the world. On Friday, the U.N. Security Council condemned the heinous and cowardly terrorist attack and underlined the need for the perpetrators to be held accountable. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres also condemned the terrorist attack in the strongest possible terms, his spokesman said. IS, which lost much of its ground after Russias military action in Syria, has long targeted Russia. In a statement posted by the groups Aamaq news agency, ISs Afghanistan affiliate said it had attacked a large gathering of Christians in Krasnogorsk. In October 2015, a bomb planted by IS downed a Russian passenger plane over Sinai, killing all 224 people on board, most of them Russian vacation-goers returning from Egypt. The group, which operates mainly in Syria and Iraq but also in Afghanistan and Africa, also has claimed several attacks in Russias volatile Caucasus and other regions in the past years. It recruited fighters from Russia and other parts of the former Soviet Union. On March 7, just hours before the U.S. embassy warned about imminent attacks, Russias top security agency said it had thwarted an attack on a synagogue in Moscow by an IS cell, killing several of its members in the Kaluga region near the Russian capital. A few days before that, Russian authorities said six alleged IS members were killed in a shootout in Ingushetia, in Russias Caucasus region. A U.S. intelligence official told the AP that American intelligence agencies had gathered information in recent weeks that the IS branch was planning an attack in Moscow, and that U.S. officials had privately shared the intelligence earlier this month with Russian officials. Another U.S. official said the IS branch in Afghanistan had long targeted Russia and reiterated that no Ukrainians were involved in the attack. Both officials were briefed on the matter but werent authorized to publicly discuss the intelligence information and spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity. Just three days before the attack, Putin had publicly denounced the Western warnings of a potential terrorist attack as an attempt to intimidate Russians. All that resembles open blackmail and an attempt to frighten and destabilize our society, he said at a meeting with top security officials. Source: Associated Press -Agencies",

        "date": "March 24, 2024 09:15 am",
        "content": "India has extended its ban on onion exports indefinitely - a surprise move that comes ahead of a general election and is set to exacerbate high prices in some overseas markets. Imposed by India - the worlds biggest exporter of the vegetable - in December, the ban was due to expire on March 31. Traders had anticipated it would be lifted as local prices have more than halved since the export restrictions were implemented and this seasons crop is yielding fresh supplies. However, the government issued an order late on Friday that the ban will remain in place until further notice. The extension is surprising and completely unnecessary, considering the falling prices with rising supplies from the new season crop, said an executive at a Mumbai-based export firm, who declined to be identified. Onion prices in some wholesale markets in Maharashtra, the biggest onion-producing state, have fallen to 1,200 rupees (14) per 100 kg from 4,500 rupees in December, the executive said. Prime Minister Narendra Modi is seeking a record-equalling third straight term in upcoming elections that will be held over almost seven weeks from April 19. Countries such as Bangladesh, Malaysia, Nepal and the United Arab Emirates rely on imports from India to fill domestic gaps in onion supply and many of those nations have struggled with high prices since the ban. Indias move is allowing rival exporters to quote much higher prices since buyers have no choice, said another executive at an export company based in Mumbai. Traders estimate that India, which has shorter shipment times than rivals such as China or Egypt for many markets, accounts for more than half of all onion imports by Asian countries. India exported a record 2.5 million metric tons of onions in the financial year that ended on March 31, 2023. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "title": "New reforms vital for countrys economic recovery - President",
        "date": "March 24, 2024 10:44 am",
        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe emphasized the necessity of a new economic reform program for the countrys economic recovery. He urged collective support from all citizens to prevent the next generation from inheriting the hardships of past economic crises, the Presidents Media Division (PMD) said. The President reminisced about inheriting a country others were reluctant to lead, highlighting that while some focused on their political aspirations, his concerns were committed towards the welfare of the nations future. President Ranil Wickremesinghe made these remarks while participating in a friendly discussion organized by the United Youth Union on the theme Future of our Youth. The event took place yesterday (23) in Polonnaruwa. During the Conversation with the President meeting, President Ranil Wickremesinghe engaged in discussions with the youth, focusing on the future and vision of the country. The President addressed various issues raised by the youth and provided solutions during the session. During the event, President Ranil Wickramasinghe asserted that the populace would reap the rewards of the governments on-going economic reform endeavours within a few years. He stressed the importance of the nations youth determining the trajectory towards a brighter future for both themselves and the country. Addressing the youth, the President emphasized: I assumed leadership of a country in decline, one that other political leaders were reluctant to govern. Contemplating the consequences had I not stepped in, I recognized the stakes were high. While some feared the impact on their political careers, I considered the dire prospect of the countrys demise if immediate action wasnt taken. My sole challenge was my solitary presence in Parliament. However, around December, I engaged in discussions with the Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank (WB). Subsequently, I briefed the former President on these discussions and urged him to implement the proposed program. In the previous election, the United National Party declared the countrys financial deficit, emphasizing the urgent need to secure at least US 03 billion. Despite our efforts, this candid disclosure did not resonate with voters. However, the accuracy of this statement became evident in 2021. Assuming leadership amidst such dire circumstances, I pondered the repercussions had I not stepped in. The nations economy teetered on the brink of collapse, necessitating immediate action. We diligently pursued support from the IMF to revive the ailing economy. Successfully concluding negotiations with the IMF, we are now poised to engage with the countries from which we have borrowed, seeking further assistance to stabilize our financial footing. Following these discussions, our countrys development initiatives will receive renewed support from these nations. However, it is crucial to acknowledge that this alone does not address all our challenges. Persistently operating as an import-dependent economy, where imports surpass exports annually necessitates borrowing to bridge this gap. Without rectifying this structural imbalance our economy risks collapsing again within the next decade. It is incumbent upon each of us to prevent the transmission of this economic crisis to the next generation. I firmly believe that this responsibility rests upon all our shoulders, necessitating our full dedication. Urgent economic restructuring is imperative, transitioning from an import-dependent to an export-driven economy. This requires comprehensive economic development across urban and rural areas alike, coupled with stringent budgetary controls. By implementing these governmental reforms, we can envisage a shift to an export-oriented economy by 2035, paving the way for sustained economic growth thereafter. Furthermore, the government aims to double the annual tourist arrivals to Sri Lanka from 2.5 million to 5 million. Efforts will also be made to attract high-spending tourists to the country. Additionally, we are dedicated to rural development through an agricultural modernization initiative. This initiative aims to facilitate agricultural exports by enhancing rural infrastructure. We are introducing new crop varieties and collaborating with the Thai government to explore Durian cultivation opportunities. By increasing crop productivity, we envisage substantial improvements in the rural economy. With abundant solar and wind resources in our country, transitioning to wind and solar energy production could yield tenfold the required energy, with surplus electricity exportable to India. Moreover, a thousand-acre investment zone in Trincomalee is underway, supported by India. Plans also include the development of the Mahaweli A and B zones to establish modern agricultural practices. Efforts have been underway to establish new investment zones in Bingiriya and the North, with the requisite land already earmarked for this purpose. These initiatives are slated for implementation within the next five years. I am undertaking all these endeavours for the betterment of your future. It should be emphasized that these efforts are ultimately for the benefit and prosperity of your children. Additionally, efforts have been directed towards the development of the Higurakgoda area, with funding allocated this year for the construction of Higurakgoda Airport. This initiative will expand air services to the province. Furthermore, the historic town of Polonnaruwa can be made accessible to tourists both day and night. By integrating cultural elements with modern dances and songs, we have the potential to organize diverse tourism programs. It is imperative that we advance with these initiatives. Henceforth, it is imperative for the youth to chart the course for the nations future. You hold the reins to your destiny. Within our political landscape, there exists a faction advocating quick fixes akin to oil medicine. However, the issues confronting our nation cannot be remedied with such temporary solutions. Therefore, I urge you to exercise caution and foresight as you navigate towards the future. The questions posed by the youth and the responses provided by President Ranil Wickremesinghe are outlined below: Q: We have a significant expanse of paddy fields within the Lankapura Gramaseva Division, with some of these fields under the jurisdiction of the Wildlife Department. We kindly request your consideration to allocate these fields once again for cultivation purposes. A: As per the 1985 map, there are lands designated under the purview of the Department of Wildlife, as well as lands allotted to villages. We seek to thoroughly review this information and proceed with necessary actions accordingly. Q: As youth, we hold great admiration for you. In our region, there is potential to generate revenue in dollars. We believe that showcasing the wild elephants that frequent our villages could attract foreign visitors and enable us to earn foreign currency. Therefore, we request your support in providing us with training opportunities, enabling us to contribute to the countrys revenue while securing our own income. A: Tourism in our country is currently making significant strides forward. Furthermore, a committee has been tasked with the promotion of tourism. Therefore, I would like to assure you that solutions will be forthcoming in the near future Q: We reside in a remote village located in the Welikanda area. We kindly appeal to you to allocate land for us to engage in cultivation activities utilizing modern technology as part of the governments agricultural modernization project. A: In 1977, the Welikanda area was predominantly covered by dense forest. Today, Welikanda and Maduru Oya have evolved into highly conducive provinces for agriculture. We have devised plans to introduce modern agricultural practices to the village under the Agricultural Modernization Project. Additionally, we have initiated a program to distribute free land deeds to the residents, with the aim of completing it within two months, granting legal land rights to 02 million people. Furthermore, we aspire to boost the tourism industry in this area and encourage agricultural cultivation as part of the agricultural modernization program. Q: Dimbulagala holds a distinctive position within the tourism industry. I recommend that special attention be directed towards its development. A: With the assistance of the International Monetary Fund program, there is now an opportunity to execute the countrys development initiatives. Consequently, the government has prioritized the promotion of tourism and is aiming to boost tourist arrivals. Additionally, efforts are underway to elevate tourism revenue to LKR 5.5 million. It is noteworthy that the government is concentrating on the development of all regions as potential tourist attractions. Q: President, I am a law student. In 1989, Janatha Vimukti Peramuna (JVP) killed six members of my family in a single day and looted property worth LKR 08 million. Their bodies were not even allowed to be buried in the cemetery. We still live in fear due to the remnants of JVP. As a member of the affected family, I have been unfairly deprived of my shop on the main street owned by the Higurakgoda Provincial Council as an act of political revenge, hindering my ability to conduct business. For three decades, many young individuals like me have endured such political reprisals, depriving us of rightful opportunities. I am curious if you have any plans to address this issue. A: We are prepared to address your concerns. Best wishes with your studies. The event was attended by Senior Advisor to the President on National Security and Chief of Presidential Staff Sagala Ratnayaka, former Deputy Minister Chandrasiri Suriyarachchi, SLPP Organizer of Minneriya Jagath Samarawickrama, Chairman of the United Youth Advisory Board Sudath Chandrasekera, its Director General Prasad Asanka Ratnayake, National Organizer Vijith Anuradha, and a significant number of youth representing the Polonnaruwa district. --PMD--",

        "title": "Putin vows to punish those behind Russia concert massacre",
        "date": "March 24, 2024 12:02 pm",
        "content": "Russia said on Saturday it had arrested all four gunmen suspected of carrying out a shooting massacre in a concert hall near Moscow, and President Vladimir Putin pledged to track down and punish those behind the attack. Militant Islamist group Islamic State claimed responsibility for Fridays rampage, but there were indications that Russia was pursuing a Ukrainian link, despite emphatic denials from Ukrainian officials that Kyiv had anything to do with it. Moscow regional Governor Andrei Vorobyov said 133 bodies had been recovered from the rubble in 24 hours and doctors were fighting for the lives of 107 people. State TV editor Margarita Simonyan, without citing a source, had earlier given a toll of 143. In a televised address, Putin said 11 people had been detained, including the four gunmen. They tried to hide and moved towards Ukraine, where, according to preliminary data, a window was prepared for them on the Ukrainian side to cross the state border, he said. Russias FSB security service said the gunmen had contacts in Ukraine and were captured near the border. It said they were being transferred to Moscow. Neither Putin nor the FSB publicly presented any proof of a link with Ukraine, with which Russia has been waging war since Moscow invaded 25 months ago. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said it was typical of Putin and other thugs to seek to divert blame. Ukrainian military intelligence spokesperson Andriy Yusov told Reuters: Ukraine was of course not involved in this terror attack. Ukraine is defending its sovereignty from Russian invaders, liberating its own territory and is fighting with the occupiers army and military targets, not civilians. Islamic State has a strong motivation to strike Russia, which intervened against it in Syrias civil war in 2015, and security analysts said the IS claim seemed plausible as it fit the pattern of past attacks. PUTIN ADDRESS Putin cast the enemy as international terrorism and said he was ready to work with any state that wanted to defeat it. All the perpetrators, organisers and those who ordered this crime will be justly and inevitably punished. Whoever they are, whoever is guiding them, Putin said. We will identify and punish everyone who stands behind the terrorists, who prepared this atrocity, this strike against Russia, against our people. A senior Russian lawmaker, Andrei Kartapolov, said that if Ukraine was involved, then Russia must deliver a worthy, clear and concrete reply on the battlefield. Western nations, including the United States whose ties with Moscow have been fraught since its invasion of Ukraine, condemned the attack and expressed sympathy for the Russian people affected. Arab powers and many former Soviet republics also expressed shock and sent their condolences. The White House said the U.S. government shared information with Russia early this month about a planned attack in Moscow, and issued a public advisory to Americans in Russia on March 7. It said Islamic State bore sole responsibility for the attack. There was no Ukrainian involvement whatsoever, U.S. National Security Council spokesperson Adrienne Watson said on Saturday. But Russias ambassador to the United States, Anatoly Antonov, said early on Sunday the U.S. had not shared any specific information with the embassy before the shooting. No specific information, nothing was given to us, Antonov said, according to Russias TASS state news agency. He said there has also been no contact after the attack. Verified footage showed camouflage-clad gunmen opening fire with automatic weapons in the Crocus City Hall near Moscow. Video showed people taking their seats, then rushing for the exits as repeated gunfire echoed above screams. Investigators said some died from gunshot wounds and others in a huge fire that broke out in the complex. Reports said the gunmen lit the blaze using petrol from canisters they carried in rucksacks. People fled in panic. Baza, a news outlet with good contacts in Russian security and law enforcement, said 28 bodies were found in a toilet and 14 on a staircase. Many mothers were found embracing their children, it said. Russian lawmaker Alexander Khinshtein said the attackers fled in a Renault vehicle that was spotted by police in Bryansk region, about 340 km (210 miles) southwest of Moscow on Friday night. He said a car chase ensued after they disobeyed orders to stop. Khinshtein said a pistol, a magazine for an assault rifle, and passports from Tajikistan were found in the car. Tajikistan is a mainly Muslim Central Asian state that used to be part of the Soviet Union. BBC News Russian Service quoted an unnamed source familiar with the security response as saying one attacker was killed in the concert hall, and another in the car in Bryansk. The BBC said it had a copy of that dead mans passport, who it said was a 30-year-old citizen of Tajikistan. SUSPECT INTERROGATED TV editor Simonyan published a video showing one of the suspects, a young, bearded man, being interrogated aggressively by a roadside, replying in heavily accented Russian to a series of barked questions. He said he had flown from Turkey on March 4 and had received instructions from unknown people via Telegram to carry out the attack in exchange for money. The man was trembling throughout the questioning. He was initially shown lying on his stomach with his hands bound behind his back, his chin resting on the boot of a figure in camouflage uniform. Later he was hauled up onto his knees. Another man with cuts and bruises to his face was shown being questioned via an interpreter while sitting on a bench with bound hands and feet. The Kremlin said Putin had held conversations with the leaders of Belarus, Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan in which all sides affirmed their willingness to work together to fight terrorism. GUNFIRE AND SCREAMS Long lines formed in Moscow on Saturday for people to donate blood. Health officials said more than 120 people were wounded. Russia tightened security at airports, transport hubs and across the capital, and big public events were cancelled across the country. Islamic State, which once sought control over swathes of Iraq and Syria, claimed responsibility for the attack, the groups Amaq agency said on Telegram. Islamic State said its fighters attacked on the outskirts of Moscow, killing and wounding hundreds and causing great destruction to the place before they withdrew to their bases safely. The statement gave no further detail. On Saturday it released a photograph of what it said were the four attackers, as well as what it said was footage of the attack. The roughly 90-second video showed a close-up view of one of the gunmen opening fire on several victims as he entered what appears to be the concert hall. A U.S. official said the United States had intelligence confirming Islamic States claim of responsibility for the shooting. The official, speaking on condition of anonymity said Washington had warned Moscow appropriately in recent weeks of the possibility of an attack. Fridays attack, about 20 km (12 miles) from the Kremlin, happened two weeks after the U.S. embassy in Russia warned that extremists had imminent plans for an attack in Moscow. Hours before the embassy warning, the FSB said it had foiled an attack on a Moscow synagogue by Islamic States affiliate in Afghanistan, known as ISIS-Khorasan or ISIS-K, which seeks a caliphate across Afghanistan, Pakistan, Turkmenistan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and Iran. Putin changed the course of the Syrian civil war by intervening in 2015, supporting President Bashar al-Assad against the opposition and Islamic State. ISIS-K has been fixated on Russia for the past two years, frequently criticizing Putin in its propaganda, said Colin Clarke of the Soufan Center, a New York-based research group. The broader Islamic State group has claimed deadly attacks across the Middle East, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iran, Europe, the Philippines and Sri Lanka. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

He will leave for the island nation on March 29 and is expected to stay there for four to five days. He will also establish a permanent setup of the temple administration. According to senior TTD officials, a Sri Lanka-based Trust had approached the Union government through the Government of Sri Lanka, seeking help in the construction of a massive Hindu temple of Lord Venkateswara in their country. The TTD was apprised of the matter. Subsequently, the Temple Trust approved the construction of the temple in Colombo in a step towards disseminating Hindu dharma. Dharma Reddy was scheduled to leave for Sri Lanka on March 2, but it was postponed to March 26 and later to March 29, due to some administrative reasons. End of the financial year is often hectic for the Srivari Trust. According to TTD sources, once the site for the proposed temple is finalised and designs are prepared, the idols for the main temple and sub-temples will be provided by the TTD. They will be sculpted at the TTD-run Sri Venkateswara College of Traditional Sculpture and Architecture in Tirupati. The Trust will also provide temple motifs and other paraphernalia associated with the temples structure, administration, and rituals. Focus will reportedly be on creating an administrative set up for the proposed temple in the island country on the lines of the Srivari Temple Trust in Tirumala.

Tennakoon made these remarks while addressing the media concerning the recent controversial comments made by former President Maithripala Sirisena regarding the Easter Sunday attacks. However, he emphasized that since a trial is already underway regarding the Easter Sunday bomb attacks in the courts, the police will inform the Attorney General and the courts once a statement is recorded from the former President, in order to proceed with further legal action. Public Security Minister Tiran Alles instructed me yesterday to initiate an investigation regarding the statement made by Mr. Maithripala Sirisena. Accordingly, I informed the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) to launch an immediate investigation into the matter. The CID has already notified Mr. Maithripala to appear before the CID to make a statement. He will appear before the CID within the next 48 hours accordingly. Further legal proceedings will be carried out based on the statement he makes. Furthermore, the IGP expressed that the requests made by several individuals to arrest the former President based on his statement, which are being circulated through the media are baseless. He also asserted that if such a situation arises after investigations are carried out regarding the information to be revealed by the former President, the police can then proceed with his arrest. Lets look at this positively. If he has acquired any valuable information later on regarding the culprits, we have to investigate the matter, but not to arrest the person providing the information, Tennakoon added.",

        "date": "March 24, 2024 10:17 pm",
        "content": "Russia struck critical infrastructure in Ukraines western region of Lviv with missiles early on Sunday, Kyiv said, in a major airstrike that saw one Russian cruise missile briefly fly into Polish airspace according to Warsaw. Moscow launched 57 missiles and drones in the attack that also targeted the capital Kyiv, two days after the largest aerial bombardment of Ukraines energy system in more than two years of full-scale war, Kyiv said. There were two preliminary hits on the same critical infrastructure facility that the occupiers targeted at night, Lvivs regional governor Maksym Kozytskyi wrote on the Telegram messaging app. The strike used Kinzhal hypersonic missiles, which are harder to shoot down, he added, without identifying the facility. The energy ministry said equipment caught fire when a critical energy facility in the Lviv region was attacked, causing it to lose power. It was unclear if they were talking about the same facility. Air defences destroyed 18 of 29 inbound missiles and 25 of 28 attack drones, the air force said. There were almost no details about what had been damaged, but the targeting of critical infrastructure could indicate Russia is trying to keep up pressure on the energy system after its strikes caused widespread blackouts on Friday. The energy ministry said Ukraine, which has been exporting power in recent weeks, had sharply increased imports of electricity and stopped exports on Sunday after attacks on the energy system. Several explosions rang out in Kyiv in the early hours as air defences destroyed about a dozen missiles over the capital and its vicinity, said Serhiy Popko, head of Kyivs military administration. There was only minor damage from the attack, he said. Small groups of people huddled for safety underground in a central Kyiv metro station in the early hours, some of them sleeping on camping mats. Moscow has been pounding Ukraine for days in attacks portrayed by Moscow as revenge for Ukrainian attacks that were conducted during Russias presidential election. The wreckage of a downed Kh-55 cruise missile was found in a Kyiv park, officials said. For the third pre-dawn morning this week, all of Ukraine is under an air alert and has been advised to seek shelter, U.S. Ambassador Bridget Brink posted on X. Russias defence ministry did not immediately reply to a request for comment. POLISH AIRSPACE Polands armed forces said a Russian cruise missile launched at the region of Lviv had violated Polands airspace. The object entered Polish space near the town of Oserdow (Lublin Voivodeship) and stayed there for 39 seconds, it said on the social media platform X. During the entire flight, it was observed by military radar systems. Polands army spokesperson, Jacek Goryszewski, told reporters that the missile travelled about 2 km (1.2 miles) into Polish airspace before returning to Ukraine. There was no immediate comment from Russia. Warsaw said it would demand an explanation from Moscow. Polish Defence Minister Wladyslaw Kosiniak-Kamysz said Warsaw would continue to support Ukraine both militarily and on the humanitarian side. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "date": "March 25, 2024 07:54 am",
        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe outlined his intention to spearhead thorough deliberations concerning healthcare service advancements, emphasizing the incorporation of modern technology to enhance medical facilities. He highlighted the governments commitment to empowering individuals for the betterment of society, emphasizing the crucial role of healthcare. The President encouraged input from Medical Officers to shape a new healthcare framework and expressed readiness to revisit for additional discussions on leadership and government engagement. President Ranil Wickramasinghe emphasized this during a meeting held with the Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA). The GMOA hosted a one-day workshop on Leadership and Skills Development on Saturday (23) at the Sudu Araliya Hotel in Polonnaruwa. While attending a nearby official event, the President received an urgent invitation from the association and briefly visited the workshop venue. In response to the invitation, the President promptly joined the members of the Government Medical Officers Association for a friendly discussion, the Presidents Media Division (PMD) reported. Addressing members of the GMOA, President Ranil Wickremesinghe delved into the historical backdrop of the countrys free healthcare system, tracing its origins to colonial and post-colonial eras. Expressing concern over its compatibility with advancing medical technology and evolving needs, he stressed the imperative of strategic foresight, suggesting that present decisions would significantly shape the healthcare landscape for the next decade and beyond. He underscored the nexus between economic prosperity and the allocation of resources to pivotal sectors such as education, healthcare, and housing. Despite the framework of an open market economy, the President identified healthcare as a paramount priority, particularly in light of the challenges posed by technological advancements. He questioned the readiness of hospitals to embrace innovations like Artificial Intelligence and adapt to changing paradigms.

The CID summoned the former President in order to record a statement over the controversial statement he recently made on the Easter Sunday attacks, after Minister of Public Security Tiran Alles had instructed the IGP to carry out an investigation into Sirisenas remarks. On Friday (22), former President Maithripala Sirisena had stirred controversy when he claimed he was aware of the true masterminds of the 2019 Easter Sunday terror attacks and that he was prepared to disclose the information to the judiciary if inquired from him or if an order is issued regarding the matter. Speaking to the media in Kandy, Sirisena had claimed that he is ready to disclose the relevant information and that at the same time, it is the responsibility of the judges to keep the information strictly confidential. The comments sparked controversy in the political arena with some accusing the former President of allegedly willfully concealing crucial information about the heinous bombings that claimed the lives of more than 250 people. Amidst the controversy, however former President Sirisena had later claimed that his statement was based on certain information he had received three weeks ago. However, addressing the media concerning the matter, IGP Deshabandu Tennakoon yesterday stated that the procedure does not entail the immediate arrest of individuals willing to provide information regarding the perpetrators of the Easter Sunday bomb attacks and instead the focus should be on investigating the information provided to apprehend the suspects. However, he emphasized that since a trial is already underway regarding the Easter Sunday bomb attacks in the courts, the police will inform the Attorney General and the courts once a statement is recorded from the former President, in order to proceed with further legal action. Former President Maithripala Sirisena had informed the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) yesterday that he will appear before the CID within today (March 25) to make a statement over his comments.",

        "date": "March 25, 2024 02:55 pm",
        "content": "Nissan Motor said on Monday it would launch 30 new models over the next three years and aim to raise its global sales by 1 million vehicles while cutting costs to improve profitability. Announcing an update to its medium-term business plan, Japans third-largest automaker by sales said it would target an operating profit margin of over 6 by end of the financial year to March 2027 and total shareholder returns of more than 30. Nissan was a pioneer in electric vehicles with its all-battery-powered Leaf but its EV efforts have been eclipsed by the likes of U.S. rival Tesla and Chinese leader BYD, including in the worlds biggest car market, China. Nissan expects all-battery powered cars to make up about a fifth of its global sales by then and those running on its hybrid power system to account for another fifth, while those with only an internal combustion engine would comprise the remaining 60. The Japanese automaker now aims to have electrified vehicles, which include hybrids, make up 60 of global sales by the end of the decade, up from a goal of 55 released in February 2023. Faced with cut-throat competition, Nissan and domestic rival Honda Motor, this month said they would consider a strategic partnership to collaborate on key components for EVs and other areas. Of the 30 new models, 16 would be electrified, including eight all-battery powered vehicles and four plug-in hybrids, it said. Nissan plans to reduce the cost of the next generation of EVs by 30 to make them comparable to internal combustion engine models by 2030. In the U.S. and Canada, Nissan expects to launch seven new models and to revamp 78 of its passenger vehicle line-up for the Nissan brand as well as launching e-power and plug-in hybrid models. The automaker also plans to roll out eight new-energy vehicles in the Chinese market, four of which will be Nissan brand models, and six new models in Europe. It is also aiming to launch by the end of its financial year to March 2029 a new electric 3-row SUV that will come with a 50 reduction in quick charging time and 50 higher energy density compared to the Ariya model. Nissan will explore new partnerships in the U.S. and Japan and continue to leverage its long-standing alliance with Renault and Mitsubishi Motors, in Europe and other regions such as India and Latin America, it said. Sources said this month that Nissan was in advanced talks to invest in EV maker Fisker, so that it could utilise its truck platform. Nissans aim to boost annual sales and increase its operating profit margin would lay the groundwork for a later phase of its plan aimed at enabling a transition to EVs and realising long-term profitable growth, it said.

This order was issued by Colombo High Court judge Sujeewa Nissanka, when the relevant petition was taken up for consideration today (25). The attorneys representing Rambukwella, who is in remand custody in connection with the substandard human intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) procurement, submitted the revision bail application to the Colombo High Court on March 15 after the Maligakanda Magistrates Court had rejected bail for the former Health Minister, the former health secretary and 4 other accused in the case. Furthermore, the magistrate had ordered them to be remanded in custody until the conclusion of the case under the provisions of the Public Property Act and fixed the case to be recalled on March 28. In his bail application, filed through his legal counsels, Rambukwella claimed that the Maligakanda Magistrates decision to reject bail for him was unlawful. He also sought the High Court to release him on bail subjected to any condition. Eight individuals including former Health Minister Keheliya Rambukwella, former Health Ministry Secretary Janaka Chandragupta and Additional Secretary of the Health Ministry Dr. Saman Ratnayake currently remain under remand custody following their arrest in connection with the case. The Criminal Investigation Department (CID) had arrested Rambukwella on February 02 in connection with the procurement of substandard human intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), when he arrived there, complying with a court order. He had been grilled for nearly 10 hours before being arrested. The arrest came hot on the heels of pressure from civil society activists and health sector trade unionists, who called for the immediate apprehension of the lawmaker. On February 29, Rambukwellas attorneys also filed a Fundamental Rights (FR) petition challenging his arrest by the CID and demanding Rs. 100 million in compensation.",

Following the presidents directive, breakfast will be served between 7:30 am and 8:30 am, aligning with expert recommendations on optimal nutrition timing. Under the banner of Healthy Active Generation, the 2024 school meal program seeks to address nutritional deficiencies among students, enhance daily attendance rates, instill healthy eating and lifestyle habits, elevate academic performance, and promote local culinary traditions. This years school feeding program benefits 1.6 million students, encompassing primary grade pupils from 9,134 government schools as well as schools with fewer than 100 students. The government has earmarked a budget of Rs. 16.6 billion, allocated directly to the nine provincial councils, with additional sponsorship from organizations such as the World Food Program and the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). Local suppliers supply the necessary food for this nutritional initiative, contributing to the growth of the countrys manufacturing economy by generating new jobs directly and indirectly. A transparent financial oversight mechanism is in place to ensure accountability and reporting for all aspects of the school meal program. The Ministry of Education, specifically its Health and Nutrition Branch, has been tasked with overseeing and monitoring the programs management activities since its inception, ensuring continuous vigilance over its implementation. Principal Mrs. Priyangika Wijesinghe extended her gratitude to President Ranil Wickremesinghe by presenting a souvenir in recognition of his participation in the event. President Ranil Wickremesinghe, addressing the event, elaborated: Today marks the commencement of the school meal program, a pivotal step in fulfilling one of the governments key objectives. Recognizing that education encompasses not only academic knowledge and examination performance but also nutritional well-being, this initiative mirrors global practices adopted by numerous nations. Malnutrition poses a significant challenge within our borders, transcending income disparities addressed by the expanded Aswasuma program. However, the root causes extend beyond financial limitations, affecting students of all backgrounds. Many commence their school day before dawn, foregoing breakfast and often lunch, underscoring the universal necessity for school-provided meals. As we strive to modernize our education system, our focus extends beyond the immediate horizon, envisioning an educational framework suited not just for 2024 but also for 2030. Initiatives are underway to equip teachers with modern educational techniques and instill students with essential technological proficiency, including the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into every school curriculum. To support this endeavour, the establishment of AI societies within schools and the enactment of legislation to establish a National AI Centre are underway, with substantial government funding allocated for research and educational endeavours. Embracing the imperative of technological literacy, efforts to overhaul the education and examination systems are underway, accompanied by programs aimed at enhancing English language proficiency among students. These multifaceted initiatives underscore our commitment to equipping the youth with the knowledge and skills necessary for success in an increasingly digital and interconnected world. Minister of Education Dr. Susil Premajayantha: Previously, the food program primarily targeted students in remote provinces, but as of this year, it extends to providing nutritious meals to first through fifth-grade students. President Ranil Wickremesinghe, in his capacity as Minister of Finance, has earmarked Rs. 16.6 billion for this initiative, supplemented by aid from the United Nations Food Program. Consequently, all 1.7 million primary grade students now receive a nourishing morning meal, with instructions issued to ensure adherence to nutritional standards. By satisfying their hunger before lessons begin, children are better positioned to engage in educational activities, potentially enhancing their cognitive well-being. While textbooks and uniforms were distributed promptly last month, the commencement of the nutritious meal program today has received minimal media coverage. I urge media organizations, known for spotlighting issues of malnutrition, to also disseminate information about this vital nutritional intervention, thus ensuring wider public awareness. Secretary to the Ministry of Education Ms Wasantha Perera: Aligned with the Presidents initiative for transformative educational reform, the implementation of the food program commences today, aiming to enhance childrens nutritional well-being. Under the auspices of the Ministry of Education, our efforts are directed towards cultivating a generation of students prepared for the future through progressive educational reforms. The objective is to foster a knowledgeable society equipped with an education system tailored to the demands of the contemporary world. Present at this momentous occasion were Western Province Governor Marshal of the Air Force Roshan Gunathilake, State Ministers Mr. Vijitha Berugoda and Mr. Arvind Kumar, alongside officials from the Ministry of Education, teaching staff, and parents. --PMD",

        "date": "March 25, 2024 10:33 pm",
        "content": "The Committee on Public Accounts (COPA) has instructed the officials of the Ministry of Finance to immediately report the matter of the importation of 102 spoiled fish containers into the country to the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) as it appears to be a criminal matter. Furthermore, high officials of the Criminal Investigation Department who were present at the Committee meeting held were informed to expedite the investigation in this regard. This was notified when the Committee on Public Accounts met recently under the Chairmanship of MP Lasantha Alagiyawanna to examine the facts disclosed by the audit inquiry regarding the entry of a ship which sailed from Seychelles to Thailand with spoiled fish containers, was let into the country from the port of Colombo. A ship carrying 102 containers of fish (over 2700 mt) from Seychelles to Thailand has suffered a technical fault near Sri Lanka. It was also disclosed that the fish had been spoiled due to the ships power failure. Accordingly, the Auditor-General W.P.C. Wickramaratne stated that the ship has arrived at the port of Colombo on 13.01.2022 and instead of leaving following the ships repair and many issues have arisen due to the intake of these containers to Sri Lanka. In the event of an emergency, though certain facilities are provided at the nearest port, the Auditor-General pointed out that the decision to unload this stock of fish in Sri Lanka despite the fact that the Customs Ordinance states the importation of rotten, odorous, disease-causing small fish, grains and other things unfit for consumption are prohibited is deeply concerning. As it is against the existing law of the land to unload spoiled fish in Sri Lanka, it was disclosed that the containers were landed in Sri Lanka by obtaining a new CUSDEC permit using a buyer as an importer to Sri Lanka on the recommendations of a committee consisting of senior Customs officials appointed by the Customs. The fact that it is a fraud to showcasing non imported containers as imports was also discussed here. Furthermore, the Auditor-General pointed out that the date of the invoice presented as an import is marked as 10.12.2021 which is a date prior to 13.01.2022 which is the date the ship arrived at the port. The Auditor-General emphasized that it is thus problematic. However, the Import and Export Control General stated that according to the report of the Customs Committee, on the recommendations of the Central Environment Authority, the relevant agency applied for the import of this fish for the production of organic fertilizer and the relevant permission was obtained according to the Import and Export Control Act. It was disclosed that 4 of the 102 containers were destroyed, 43 of the remaining 98 were used to produce fertilizer, 40 were re-exported and 15 were still remaining in the country. It was also discussed that during a physical inspection conducted in July 2023, it was observed that the remaining 15 containers were oozing with and odour of rotten fish. It was also discussed that the re-export of such fish containers taken into the country stating it is for the purpose of making organic fertilizers is also problematic. Moreover, the Auditor-General stated that the main business of the company that obtained this stock of fish to make fertilizer is canned salmon production which is concerning. However, the customs officials who were present stated that it is two distinct businesses and therefore, the officials testify to the fact that these fish were not used to make canned salmon. The Committee Chair stated that although there is no issue in assisting a ship when it is in distress, it is clear that in this context, it is not the case. He pointed out that bringing a stock of rotten fish that no one wants to buy into the country is a serious situation and a threat to the environment and lives. Lasantha Alagiyawanna further stated that there is a doubt as to whether these fish have been used for human consumption and that there are many issues observed in this entire process. Moreover, the Chair pointed out that though it was recommended to the Department of Import and Export Control during the COPA held on 23.01.2024 to appoint a committee consisting of all relevant institutions in relation to this incident for the purpose of conducting a field tour and report how much fertilizer has been produced, it was disclosed that the said committee was appointed after receiving the summoning letters for this meeting. The Chair of the Committee expressed his strong displeasure in this regard. Furthermore, the Chair state that it appears that the customs officials have been working with great interest to get the containers into Sri Lanka and thus, the same interest should be there for other activities as well. State Ministers Mohan Priyadarshana De Silva, Diana Gamage, Chamara Sampath Dasanayake, Members of Parliament Tissa Attanayake, Isuru Dodangoda, (Dr.) (Ms.) Harini Amarasuriya, officials representing the Ministry of Environment, Ministry of Finance, Department of Import and Export Control, Sri Lanka Customs, Sri Lanka Police, Criminal Investigation Department and Auditor Generals Department were present at this Committee meeting held.",

        "date": "March 26, 2024 07:44 am",
        "content": "UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - The United Nations Security Council on Monday demanded an immediate ceasefire between Israel and Palestinian militants Hamas and the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages after the United States abstained from the vote. The remaining 14 council members voted for the resolution, which was proposed by the 10 elected members of the body. Washington had been averse to the word ceasefire earlier in the nearly six-month-old war in the Gaza Strip and had used its veto power to shield U.S. ally Israel as it retaliated against Hamas for an Oct. 7 attack that Israel says killed 1,200 people. But amid growing global pressure for a truce in the war that has killed more than 32,000 Palestinians, the U.S. abstained from the vote on Monday to allow the Security Council to demand an immediate ceasefire for the month of Muslim fasting month of Ramadan, which ends in two weeks. It also demands the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages. Israel says Hamas took 253 hostages during its Oct. 7 attack. The Security Council resolution also emphasizes the urgent need to expand the flow of humanitarian assistance to and reinforce the protection of civilians in the entire Gaza Strip and reiterates its demand for the lifting of all barriers to the provision of humanitarian assistance at scale. Israeli army radio reported shortly before the council meeting started that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu would cancel a planned delegation to Washington if the U.S. did not veto the resolution. The U.S. has vetoed three draft council resolutions on the war in Gaza. It has also previously abstained twice, allowing the council to adopt resolutions that aimed to boost aid to Gaza and called for extended pauses in fighting. Russia and China have also vetoed two U.S. drafted resolutions on the conflict - in October and on Friday. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "date": "March 26, 2024 07:51 am",
        "content": "The Monetary Policy Board of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) has decided to reduce the Standing Deposit Facility Rate (SDFR) and the Standing Lending Facility Rate (SLFR) of the Central Bank by 50 basis points (bps) to 8.50 per cent and 9.50 per cent, respectively. The Board said it arrived at this decision at its meeting held on 25 March 2024 following a comprehensive assessment of current and expected domestic and international economic developments, to maintain inflation at the targeted level of 5 per cent over the medium term, while enabling the economy to reach its potential. In arriving at this decision, the Board took note of, among others, subdued aggregate demand conditions, the lesser-than-expected impact of the recent changes to the tax structure on inflation, favourable near-term inflation dynamics due to the recent adjustment to electricity tariffs, well-anchored inflation expectations, the absence of excessive external sector pressures and the need to continue the downward trajectory in market interest rates. The Board observed that the possible upside risks to inflation in the near term would not materially change the medium-term inflation outlook, as economic activity is projected to remain below par for an extended period, the statement said. The Monetary Policy Board underscored the need for a swift and full passthrough of monetary easing measures to market interest rates, particularly lending rates, by the financial institutions, thereby accelerating the normalisation of market interest rates in the period ahead. The Board also noted the improvements in domestic money market activity alongside the improvement in liquidity conditions and decided to remove the remaining restrictions on the usage of the Standing Deposit Facility (SDF) of the Central Bank with effect from 01 April 2024. This would further support market-based transmission of monetary policy adjustments, it said. The Monetary Policy Board stressed the need for all financial institutions to take swift measures to reduce market lending interest rates to ensure that the benefits of the series of monetary policy easing measures are adequately passed on to businesses and households.",

During the QA session of the special media briefing convened at the CBSL to present the second Monetary Policy Review of 2024, the Governor spoke of his duty towards his employees as the head of the institution. Speaking further, he commented that the Central Banks duty towards the country includes implementation of the monetary policy, and maintaining the stability of the banking system under the CBSL Act, adding that as the head of the institution, I have a separate duty towards my staff members. Responding to media queries, Dr. Weerasinghe underscored that it is the responsibility of institutions, both public and private, to look after their employees, within their legal framework and capacity, at times like these. He also went on to ask if an institution should wait until the economic crisis is over to provide some relief to its employees. How long should the Central Bank wait to increase the salaries? Speaking about the substantial amount of salary increase given to the CBSL employees that raised eyebrows, the governor went on to explain that the central bank is allowed to increase salaries once every three years. Commenting on the banks accountability to parliament, the Governor said the senior management and professionals of CBSL made a collective decision to consider a revision to their increased salaries. In response to a question on the suspension of Parate Law, Dr. Weerasinghe said the move is not good for credit supply and will make it difficult for small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to obtain loans. He explained that the commercial banks would be more cautious and show reluctance to lend money if they were faced with restrictions when recovering the money they have lent. That is why our position has been that the debt recovery process should be improved further without suspending the Parate Law. However, the government has taken a decision to suspend the Parate executions for 6 months he said further, expressing hopes that this would not have a significant impact.",

Traffic is being redirected, and it remains uncertain if there were any injuries.pic.twitter.com6q5smwGLWD Global Times (globaltimesnews) March 26, 2024 Baltimores Key Bridge has collapsed after it was hit by a container ship, sending cars that were crossing at the time plunging into the waters of the Patapsco River. At least seven people are believed to be in the water and rescue efforts are ongoing at the site of the collapse, according to the Baltimore Fire Department. Multiple videos shared on social media showed a large cargo ship ramming into one of the bridges support pillars, causing it to come crashing down into the river. A large portion of the Francis Scott Key Bridge is now under water, as flight tracking website FlightRadar24 showed the Maryland State Police circling the site of the crash in a helicopter. Kevin Cartwright, director of communications for the fire department, said the city was dealing with a developing mass casualty incident. The 911 calls relating to the incident began from around 1.30am, he said, as members of the public said a vessel travelling out of Baltimores port had struck a column on the bridge. Multiple vehicles, including one the size of a tractor-trailer, were on the bridge at the time of strike. Our focus right now is trying to rescue and recover these people, Mr Cartwright said, adding that its too early to know how many people are affected. There are some cargo or retainers hanging from the bridge, he said, creating unsafe and unstable conditions. Emergency responders are operating cautiously. This is a dire emergency, he added. The 47-year-old Key Bridge collapsed due to a ship strike incident and has been closed to traffic, the Maryland Transportation Authority said on X in a statement. All lanes closed both directions for incident on I-695 Key Bridge. Traffic is being detoured, it said. The container ship involved appears to be a Singapore-flagged vessel named Dali, live maritime data showed on Tuesday. It had departed the port in Baltimore at around 1 a.m. and was headed for the Sri Lankan capital Colombo, where it was due to arrive in late April. Baltimore mayor Brandon M Scott said emergency personnel were on the scene and rescue efforts underway. Im aware of and en route to the incident at the Key Bridge.

Li said China and Sri Lanka are strategic partners of cooperation characterized by sincere mutual assistance and enduring friendship spanning generations. The two countries have always respected each other and enjoyed equality and reciprocal cooperation since the establishment of diplomatic relations 67 years ago, he added. China is ready to work with Sri Lanka to implement the important consensus reached by the two heads of state during their talks last year, carry forward the tradition of friendship, consolidate political mutual trust, and expand bilateral cooperation in various fields to promote common development, Li noted. China supports Sri Lankas efforts to realize national unity and stability as well as independent economic development, Li said, adding that China is willing to push forward the implementation of major projects under the framework of the Belt and Road Initiative and deepen bilateral cooperation in trade, agriculture and marine research. He called on the two sides to explore cooperation potential in clean energy and telecommunication while strengthening exchanges and cooperation in culture, tourism and education. China encourages more companies to invest in Sri Lanka and is willing to increase imports of Sri Lankan quality products, Li said, expressing the hope that Sri Lanka could provide a good business environment for Chinese companies. Gunawardena thanked China for providing long-term support to Sri Lankas efforts to safeguard national sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity, and helping the country realize economic and social development and cope with the COVID-19 pandemic and financial crisis. Hailing the Belt and Road Initiative and global initiatives proposed by China, he said that Sri Lanka has always adhered to the one-China principle and will continue to firmly pursue policies to strengthen friendly cooperation with China.

        "date": "March 26, 2024 08:33 pm",
        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe on Tuesday (March 26) said it is necessary to maintain law and order in the country, while highlighting the crucial steps taken to safeguard state properties, including the parliament, the prime ministers office and the presidents office from violence orchestrated under the guise of a struggle. Despite criticisms labelling these actions as human rights violations, the President asserted that such measures were imperative for preventing economic instability. Stressing the importance of maintaining law and order, particularly in the aftermath of challenging times, President Wickremesinghe underscored the collective responsibility of all parties in upholding societal order. These sentiments were expressed during a meeting convened at the Presidential Secretariat, where university lecturers gathered to discuss the nations current economic program. President Wickremesinghe also revealed ongoing government efforts to implement a new education system, with a dedicated committee, chaired by the Prime Ministers Secretary, tasked with this initiative. He highlighted the governments focus on revamping school education by alleviating the burden of examinations and underscored ongoing transformations within the university sector. The President announced plans to implement these initiatives under a new parliamentary session following the upcoming elections. Emphasizing the need for collective support to ensure the success of these programs, he outlined the goal of achieving an advanced education system in the country by 2035. President Wickremesinghe stressed the importance of fostering a conducive atmosphere within the university system for the effective implementation of these reforms. He suggested that universities themselves should determine whether to retain internal administration or pursue changes to cultivate a renewed environment. Reflecting on recent protests during his attendance at the Kelaniya University inauguration, the President reaffirmed his commitment to fulfilling his responsibilities. University professors contributed insights on various educational reforms, highlighting the role of academia in knowledge creation, dissemination, and meeting national needs. Discussions centred on establishing universities as independent educational entities, providing tailored courses with technology catering to contemporary student requirements, and fostering conducive learning environments for local and international students alike. Additionally, the importance of fully restructuring the university system and turning it into institutions that contribute widely to economic development was also discussed. Below are some of the questions raised by the university lecturers and the responses given by President Ranil Wickremesinghe: Question: There is a growing global trend towards prioritizing entrepreneurship education. Should our country also consider making entrepreneurship education compulsory? Answer: The government is actively addressing practical changes within the university curricula, with the establishment of several committees tasked with this endeavour. University educators carry a significant responsibility in this regard. Question: Ensuring adherence to national laws within university education is essential. How can this be effectively implemented? Answer: This task transcends government efforts alone; it necessitates collective action. Regrettably, theres a concerning silence from some quarters, largely stemming from systemic issues dating back to the 1980s. We mustnt revert to past shortcomings but urgently develop a new education framework suited to our evolving nation, requiring broad support. Moreover, university life shouldnt solely focus on enrolment and graduation; fostering debate is equally vital. While political discussions were once commonplace on campuses, this atmosphere is now scarce. Restoring this discourse is imperative. --PMD",

        "content": "The High Commission of India, in partnership with Sri Lankas Ministry of Technology organised a conference on Digital Public Infrastructure today in Colombo on Tuesday (March 26). The conference, through its three sessions and breakout meetings explored the transformative potential of DPI for enabling service delivery, empowering communities by fostering inclusivity and enriching the economy by driving innovation. The three sessions included an Opening Plenary with the keynote address delivered by President Ranil Wickremesinghe, wherein he applauded the conference for being timely. Underlining DPI as a vital enabler for the digitisation of the Sri Lankan economy, the president emphasised the need for collaboration with India in this domain, highlighting the potential of fast-tracking growth by adapting Indias successful strategies domestically. Indias digital transformation and the significance of DPI and India Stack was elaborated upon by Santosh Jha, the High Commissioner of India to Sri Lanka in his welcome remarks and by Dr. Pramod Varma, the Co-Chair of Indias Centre for Digital Public Infrastructure (CDPI) in his presentation during the Opening Plenary. The other two sessions saw discussions amongst experts from India, Sri Lanka and the region, on the themes of Accelerating Digital Sri Lanka and Unlocking the Digital Stack respectively. The former focused on roadmap for adoption of DPI in Sri Lanka and the resultant acceleration towards e-governance across the board, with the opening remarks by Kanaka Herath, State Minister of Technology. The latter went beyond foundational DPI to discuss use cases marrying technology, markets and governance with a special focus on the positive externalities in the startups domain. This session was opened by MP Dr. Harsha de Silva. The conference was particularly enriched with several breakout meetings between visiting experts from India and their Sri Lankan counterparts as well as other stakeholders. A key highlight of these was an interaction of the visiting senior officials from Government of Indias Ministries handling Digital India and Startup India programmes with Senior Officials who are leading the six Working Groups of Government of Sri Lanka on Digital Economy. Futuristic linkages were also initiated in the startup and IT industries domain on the sidelines of the conference. Later into the day, Startup Indias team held a capacity building workshop for startups in Sri Lanka, including sessions by Indian experts on the art of pitching and effective marketing. The Chief of IIT Chennais Incubator Parvartak interacted with key startup incubators in Sri Lanka. Chairman NASSCOM called on President Wickremesinghe. The Indian High Commission says the conference is another step in the series of initiatives being undertaken to implement the Vision Document adopted by Prime Minister of India and President of Sri Lanka during the latters visit to India in July 2023 to promote connectivity, including in the digital domain. Indias ongoing grant assistance for establishing the Sri Lanka Unique Digital Identity (SL-UDI) Project is a key building block for the digital transformation of Sri Lanka aided by DPI. The various engagements on Tuesday emphasised the immense potential to leverage Indias DPI in accordance with Sri Lankas requirements and priorities towards effective and efficient delivery of citizen-centric services to the people of Sri Lanka.",

        "date": "March 26, 2024 11:57 pm",
        "content": "The year 2024 is already seeing a turnaround for private equity deals with Sri Lanka expecting deals amounting up to USD 250 million, says the Hong Kong-based merchant banking firm MCM Partners. Speaking to Bloomberg Markets Asia on Monday (March 25), Managing Director of MCM Partners Jahnavi Bhagwati explained as to why she sees a turnaround for private equity deals in 2024 as opposed to a sluggish 2023. According to her, countries like India and Sri Lanka, which is a turnaround story, are going to present opportunities in the private space this year after the Bank of Japan raised interest rates in March, ending the countrys historic era of negative interest rates in a move that marked a historic shift in monetary policy. Bhagwati mentioned that the stock markets in the region are already seeing a pickup as inflation has been curbed, adding that investment activity will spur when rate cuts kick in. Noting that a flurry of more activity is observed in private market space in 2024 compared to last year, the MCM Partners Managing Director acknowledged that 2023 was a very difficult year, except for Japan, throughout which the rest of the market suffered. But we are seeing a turnaround now in terms of investor interest, in terms of people wanting to look for opportunities. Speaking further, she said, I myself have been asked in Sri Lanka for different investment opportunities. As you know the IMF has made almost USD 3 billion of commitments in terms of a loan. But there are some points that they Sri Lanka needs to adhere to for the provisions of that loan. Therefore, Sri Lanka has several huge assets which are being divested, and a lot of institutional players and investors are looking to come in which will also spur activity there. When asked about the sizes of these equity deals, Bhagwati said Sri Lanka is expecting deals of about USD 250 million whereas Bangladesh is anticipating a potential deal amounting to USD 1 billion. Meanwhile, in India, the deal sizes are small, ranging between USD 10 million - 20 million and up to half a billion, she added.",

Made possible by the generous donation worth Rs. 2.5 billion from the M. H. Omar Foundation, this state-of-the-art facility stands as a beacon of hope for those battling liver ailments, marking a pinnacle of healthcare excellence and philanthropy.

The M. H. Omar Foundations remarkable donation of Rs. 2.5 billion for the construction of this specialized liver disease treatment centre marks the most significant contribution by a Sri Lanka entrepreneur to its healthcare and education services. Mr. M. H. Omar, the founder of the renowned Brandix Group in Sri Lanka, has spearheaded this philanthropic endeavour. The presence of a young girl who had undergone successful liver surgery at the hospital was particularly significant, as she warmly welcomed the President upon his arrival at the North Colombo Teaching Hospital. During the ceremony, the President unveiled the plaque and inaugurated the M. H. Omar Liver Care Centre, taking a first-hand observation tour on its facilities. Additionally, he took a moment to leave a note in the commemorative book of special guests, expressing gratitude for the transformative impact of the facility on the healthcare landscape of Sri Lanka. Speaking at the ceremony, President Ranil Wickremesinghe expressed his profound appreciation for the exceptional donation made by the Omar family and the significant contribution they have made to the countrys economy through the Brandix Company. Highlighting Sri Lankas current status as the premier destination for liver transplant surgeries in the region, President Wickremesinghe extended his gratitude for the esteemed reputation bestowed upon the country by healthcare professionals. He also took the opportunity to explain the audience about the governments ambitious program for transformative change in the health sector. These remarks underscored the Presidents recognition of the pivotal role played by both philanthropy and healthcare advancements in shaping Sri Lankas future. Addressing the gathering, Minister of Health and Industry Dr. Ramesh Pathirana highlighted Sri Lankas commendable position in terms of infant and maternal mortality rates, showcasing the nations resilience during challenging times such as the COVID-19 pandemic and economic crises. Expressing gratitude, Minister Pathirana acknowledged the significant contribution of Mr. M. H.

        "date": "March 27, 2024 08:51 am",
        "content": "A suicide bomber rammed a vehicle into a convoy of Chinese engineers working on a dam project in northwest Pakistan on Tuesday, killing six people, police said, the third major attack on Chinese interests in the South Asian country in a week. The first two attacks targeted a Pakistan naval air base and a strategic port used by China in the southwest province of Balochistan where Beijing is investing billions in infrastructure projects. The engineers were en route from Islamabad to their camp at the dam construction site in Dasu in the province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, regional police chief Mohammad Ali Gandapur said. Five Chinese nationals and their Pakistani driver were killed in the attack, Gandapur told Reuters. Dasu is the site of a major dam and the area has been attacked in the past. A blast on a bus killed 13 people, including nine Chinese nationals, in 2021. Chinese engineers have been working on a number of projects in Pakistan with Beijing investing over 65 billion in infrastructure works as part of the China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) under Beijings wider Belt and Road initiative. No one claimed responsibility for Tuesdays attack; there also had been no claim for the 2021 attack. Pakistan is home to twin insurgencies - one by Islamists and the other by ethnic militants seeking secession. While Chinese interests are primarily targeted by the ethnic militants seeking to push Beijing out of mineral-rich Balochistan, they generally operate in the countrys south and southwest - far from the site of Tuesdays attack. Islamists mostly operate in Pakistans northwest, the area where the convoy was attacked. Khyber Pakhtunkhwa police have reached the spot and started relief operations. A separate police source told Reuters the convoy was carrying staff of the construction firm China Gezhouba Group Company (CGGC) working on the Dasu hydropower project - the same company targeted in 2021. Construction work ceased for months after that attack. Chinas embassy in Pakistan demanded investigations into the attack. The Chinese embassy and consulates in Pakistan have immediately launched emergency work, demanding that the Pakistani side conduct a thorough investigation into the attack, severely punish the perpetrators, and take practical and effective measures to protect the safety of Chinese citizens, the embassy said in statement. The embassy on Wednesday also warned Chinese citizens to stay abreast of the situation and strengthen security measures. It said China will work more resolutely with Pakistan to do its utmost to maintain the security of Chinese personnel, projects and institutions in Pakistan. FOREIGN ELEMENTS Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif is expected to visit Beijing next week, according to a source in the Prime Ministers Office, his first since taking office following February elections. On Tuesday afternoon after the attack, Sharif went to the Chinese embassy to offer condolences to victims families and the Chinese government, the embassy said on Wednesday. A Pakistani military statement said the three attacks in the last week were aimed at destabilising the internal security situation, accusing foreign elements of aiding and abetting such incidents in Pakistan. It said strategic projects and sensitive sites vital to Pakistans economic progress were being targeted in an effort to sabotage it and sow discord between Pakistan and its allies, most notably China. Pakistans Indian Ocean port of Gwadar, on the route to key Gulf shipping lanes, is managed by China, while nearby naval air base Siddique is used to support security and development work, spearheaded by Beijing, in Balochistan. Both were attacked in recent days by Baloch separatists. Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar condemned Tuesdays attack and said Pakistan would continue to fight back against militants. Pakistans foreign office said the life and safety of Chinese nationals in Pakistan was of paramount importance. Pakistan will continue to work with our Chinese brothers in ensuring the safety and security of Chinese nationals, projects and institutions in Pakistan, it said in a statement.

        "date": "March 27, 2024 09:57 am",
        "content": "A cargo ship lost power and rammed into a major bridge in Baltimore, USA early Tuesday, destroying the span in a matter of seconds and plunging it into the river in a terrifying collapse that could disrupt a vital shipping port for months. Six people were missing and presumed dead, and the search for them was suspended until Wednesday morning. The ships crew issued a mayday call moments before the crash took down the Francis Scott Key Bridge, enabling authorities to limit vehicle traffic on the span, Marylands governor said. As the vessel neared the bridge, puffs of black smoke could be seen as the lights flickered on and off. It struck one of the bridges supports, causing the structure to collapse like a toy, and a section of the span came to rest on the bow. With the ship barreling toward the bridge at a very, very rapid speed, authorities had just enough time to stop cars from coming over the bridge, Maryland Gov. Wes Moore said. These people are heroes, Moore said. They saved lives last night. In the evening, Col. Roland L. Butler Jr., superintendent for Maryland State Police, announced that the search and rescue mission was transitioning to one of search and recovery. He also said the search was being put on pause and divers would return to the site at 6 a.m. Wednesday, when challenging overnight conditions were expected to improve. No bodies have been recovered, Butler said. The crash happened in the middle of the night, long before the busy morning commute on the bridge that stretches 1.6 miles (2.6 kilometers) and was used by 12 million vehicles last year. The six missing people were part of a construction crew filling potholes on the bridge, said Paul Wiedefeld, the states transportation secretary. Guatemalas consulate in Maryland said in a statement that two of the missing were citizens of the Central American nation. It did not provide their names but said consular officials were in contact with authorities and assisting the families. Honduras Deputy Foreign Affairs Minister Antonio García told The Associated Press that a Honduran citizen, Maynor Yassir Suazo Sandoval, was missing. He said he had been in contact with Suazos family. And the Washington Consulate of Mexico said via the social media platform X that citizens of that nation were also among the missing. It did not say how many. A senior executive at the company that employed the workers also said, in the afternoon, that the workers were presumed dead given the waters depth and how much time had passed. Jeffrey Pritzker, executive vice president of Brawner Builders, said the crew was working in the middle of the bridge when it came down. This was so completely unforeseen, Pritzker said. We dont know what else to say. We take such great pride in safety, and we have cones and signs and lights and barriers and flaggers. Jesus Campos, who has worked on the bridge for Brawner Builders and knows members of the crew, said he was told they were on a break and some were sitting in their trucks. I know that a month ago, I was there, and I know what it feels like when the trailers pass, Campos said. Imagine knowing that is falling. It is so hard. One would not know what to do. Father Ako Walker, a Roman Catholic priest at Sacred Heart of Jesus, said he spent time with the families of the missing workers as they waited for news of their loved ones. You can see the pain etched on their faces, Walker said. Rescuers pulled two people out of the water, one of whom was treated at a hospital and discharged hours later. Multiple vehicles also went into the river, although authorities did not believe anyone was inside. It looked like something out of an action movie, Baltimore Mayor Brandon Scott said, calling it an unthinkable tragedy. A police dispatcher put out a call just before the collapse saying a ship had lost its steering and asked officers to stop all traffic on the bridge, according to Maryland Transportation Authority first responder radio traffic obtained from the Broadcastify.com archive. One officer who stopped traffic radioed that he was going to drive onto the bridge to alert the construction crew. But seconds later, a frantic officer said: The whole bridge just fell down. Start, start whoever, everybody ... the whole bridge just collapsed. On a separate radio channel for maintenance and construction workers, someone said officers were stopping traffic because a ship had lost steering. There was no follow-up order to evacuate, and 30 seconds later the bridge fell and the channel went silent. From 1960 to 2015, there were 35 major bridge collapses worldwide due to ship or barge collisions, according to the World Association for Waterborne Transport Infrastructure. Tuesdays collapse is sure to create a logistical nightmare along the East Coast for months, if not years, shutting down ship traffic at the Port of Baltimore, a major hub. The loss of the bridge will also snarl cargo and commuter traffic. Losing this bridge will devastate the entire area, as well as the entire East Coast, state Sen. Johnny Ray Salling said. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said at a news conference that it was too soon to estimate how long it will take to clear the channel, which is about 50 feet (15 meters) deep. I do not know of a bridge that has been constructed to withstand a direct impact from a vessel of this size, he said. The Dali, which was headed from Baltimore to Colombo, Sri Lanka and flying under a Singapore flag, is about 985 feet (300 meters) long and about 157 feet (48 meters) wide, according to data from Marine Traffic. Synergy Marine Group, which manages the ship, confirmed that it hit a pillar of the bridge at about 1:30 a.m. while in control of one or more pilots, who are local specialists who help guide vessels safely into and out of ports. The ship is owned by Grace Ocean Private Ltd. Synergy said all crew members and the two pilots on board were accounted for, and there were no reports of any injuries. The ship was moving at 8 knots, roughly 9 mph (14.8 kph), the governor said. Inspectors found a problem with the Dalis machinery in June, but a more recent examination did not identify any deficiencies, according to the shipping information system Equasis. Danish shipping giant Maersk said it had chartered the vessel. Jagged remnants of the bridge could be seen jutting up from the water in the aftermath of the collapse. The on-ramp ended abruptly where the span once began. Donald Heinbuch, a retired chief with Baltimores fire department, said he was startled awake by a deep rumbling that shook his house for several seconds and felt like an earthquake. He drove to the rivers edge and couldnt believe what he saw. The ship was there, and the bridge was in the water, like it was blown up, he said. The bridge spans the Patapsco River at the entrance to the busy harbor, which leads to the Chesapeake Bay and Atlantic Ocean. Opened in 1977, the bridge is named for the writer of The Star-Spangled Banner. Wiedefeld said all vessel traffic into and out of the port would be suspended until further notice, though the facility was still open to trucks. President Joe Biden said he planned to travel to Baltimore and intends for the federal government to pick up the entire cost of rebuilding. This is going to take some time, Biden said. Last year the Port of Baltimore handled a record 52.3 million tons of foreign cargo worth 80 billion, according to the state. The head of a supply chain management company said Americans should expect shortages of goods from the collapses effect on ocean container shipping and East Coast trucking. Its not just the port of Baltimore thats going to be impacted, said Ryan Petersen, CEO of Flexport. The collapse, though, is not likely to hurt worldwide trade because Baltimore is not a major port for container vessels. its facilities are more important when it comes to goods such as farm equipment and autos, said Judah Levine, head of research for global freight booking platform Freightos.

        "title": "South Asias largest maternity hospital declared open in Karapitiya",
        "date": "March 27, 2024 10:50 am",
        "content": "The German-Sri Lanka Friendship New Womens Hospital in Karapitiya Galle, hailed as the largest maternity hospital in South Asia, was inaugurated by President Ranil Wickremesinghe today (27). The six-storey hospital claims 640 beds, 6 operating theatres, emergency treatment units, intensive care units, laboratories, infant intensive care units, special paediatric units, and state-of-the-art medical facilities. Additionally, it features water purification and recycling unit. The German government has contributed EUR 25 million (LKR 3570 million) to this project, in addition to providing medical equipment. Initially, 800 perches were allocated for the hospitals construction, but later, two additional plots of land were acquired, increasing the total area of the hospital to nearly one thousand perches. Former Chancellor of Germany, Helmut Kohl, made this significant donation towards the construction of a new maternity hospital in Sri Lanka. This gesture came after witnessing the devastation caused by the tsunami to Mahmodara Hospital Galle, the largest maternity hospital in the southern province, during his vacation in December 2004 at a tourist hotel in Talpe, Habaraduwa. Following the inauguration of the new hospital, plans are underway to relocate the Mahmodara Maternity Hospital from its current location. During the inauguration, President Wickremesinghe also visited the newly opened maternity hospital to inspect its facilities, including the state-of-the-art surgery rooms. The Head of State also expressed gratitude by presenting a memento to the German Ambassador to Sri Lanka, Dr. Felix Neumann, in appreciation of the generous donation received from the German government. Addressing the event, the President commented: Previously, our medical professionals battled against diseases like malaria. However, with the rise in the elderly population and the emergence of various health issues, the complexities in the healthcare sector have escalated. Hence, it is imperative to adapt and transform our healthcare services to meet these evolving challenges effectively. Furthermore, the education system in our nation necessitates a significant overhaul. Historically, the allocation of capital funds for education and healthcare has been limited. During that period, these sectors did not receive sufficient financial support, primarily due to the substantial allocation of funds towards wartime efforts. Additionally, a considerable portion of our budget has been directed towards servicing hefty loans and paying off interest. During my tenure as the Minister of Education from 1980 to 1989, efforts were made to increase funding for education. However, various circumstances hindered our ability to allocate more resources to this sector subsequently. Moving forward, it is imperative that we prioritize increased investment in education for the betterment of our nation. Due to extensive borrowing last season, a staggering 50 of our income is now allocated towards debt and interest payments. Although over 7 trillion was earmarked for this years budget, a significant portion, totalling 3.9 trillion, must be directed towards debt repayment. Of this amount, one-third is dedicated to loan settlement, while the remaining two-thirds are allocated for interest payments. Additionally, approximately 1.2 trillion is allocated for salaries. After accounting for recurring expenses, there is very little remaining for essential activities such as irrigation. As a nation, we cannot sustain this current situation. Recognizing this urgency, the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank (WB), and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) have advised us to initiate immediate restructuring measures. Our first step towards achieving economic stability involves generating the necessary funds for this years expenditure domestically. Printing money or seeking funds from state banks are not viable options at this time. Therefore, we must focus on earning the required income internally to progress forward. Implementing tax hikes was the sole viable option, despite facing widespread criticism. However, this measure eliminated the need to print money for the budget for the first time. We acknowledge the hardships endured by all, yet the tax increase spared us from budgetary loans. The impact is evident nationwide today. The rupee, once valued at 370 against the dollar, has now strengthened to 300. This trend is anticipated to continue, further bolstering the rupees value in the future. The decrease in inflation has facilitated a reduction in interest rates, which in turn is expected to stimulate business growth. As the business sector flourishes, so does the nations development. Despite the challenges faced, today the country reaps the benefits of the implemented measures. Additionally, efforts were made to augment salaries in the public sector and furthermore, we endeavoured to triple the number of Aswesuma beneficiaries and expand the scope of coverage. Corresponding initiatives were also undertaken to boost salaries in the private sector. By adhering to this program, the loan repayment burden is anticipated to diminish gradually over the next two years, freeing up resources for national development endeavours. The future holds no promise without innovation in education and healthcare. Our strides in the 1930s and 80s were fuelled by advancements in these sectors. Presently, the robustness of our healthcare system, both locally and even in the United Kingdom is a testament to our medical services. Hence, I affirm that by securing adequate funding for healthcare and education, we will foster rapid progress in these domains.",

        "date": "March 27, 2024 11:44 am",
        "content": "The two luxury houses in Dehiwala and Beruwala, seized under the Terrorism Prevention Act (PTA) after the 2019 Easter Sunday bombings, had been used for terrorism-related activities of Al-Qaeda and National Thowheed Jamaath (NTJ), the Attorney General informed the Supreme Court on Tuesday (26). This was communicated when two fundamental rights (FR) petitions filed by the owners of the two houses were called before Supreme Court Justices Preethi Padman Surasena, Shiran Gunaratna and Mahinda Samayawardhana on Tuesday (27). After taking into account the submissions made by Senior State Counsel Shaminda Wickreme on behalf of the prosecution, the judge bench ordered that the two petitions, put forward challenging the decision to seize the establishments in question, be revoked. The petitions had been filed by Mohamed Hayatullah and Mohamed Hasim, naming the Attorney General, the IGP, the Terrorism Investigation Division (TID) officers and several others as its respondents. During Tuesdays court proceedings, the prosecution, citing the findings of police investigations, revealed that the owners of the two houses have had contacts with Lukman Thalib, an individual with links to terror activities, adding that the establishments had also been used by Al-Qaeda and National Thowheed Jamaath members for their terrorism-related activities. The Senior State Counsel also disclosed that the relevant houses had been used to conduct classes related to extremist activities. Noting that the Presidents orders calling for the seizure of the two houses was based on sufficient evidence, the prosecution argued that the fundamental rights of the house owners have not been violated by the move. As such, he requested the judge bench to revoke the two petitions. However, the petitioning parties went on to vehemently reject all accusations, while emphasizing that it was unlawful to confiscate the property under the PTA. Appearing on behalf of the petitioners, Presidents Counsel Faisz Mustapha challenged the prosecutions submissions, stating that the investigators had not uncovered such information. Following a lengthy trial, the three-member judge bench ordered that the petitions be revoked without taking them up for hearing.",

        "content": "Sri Lankas President Ranil Wickremesinghe has expressed admiration for Indias digital achievements, citing it as a model worth emulating. Speaking at a conference on Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI) in Colombo, President Wickremesinghe emphasised the need for collaboration with India, highlighting the potential to save years in development by adopting Indias digital strategies. In implementing it, we needed help, and the best place we could get was India. I spoke with PM Modi when I was in India last year, and as part of our integration, we said, we would like to go with India, you have done so much, stated President Wickremesinghe, underlining the significance of seeking guidance from Indias experience. Acknowledging Indias historical contribution, he added, Another reason I took India, is it is the country that discovered zero. Where would the world be had India not discovered zero. Wickremesinghe expressed his intention to mirror Indias digital advancements, tailored to suit Sri Lankas needs. Let us piggyback your experience. It will save us a few years, maybe 4-5 years in development, he affirmed. President Wickremesinghe outlined his vision for Sri Lankas digital future, emphasising the importance of digital public infrastructure. We want to go ahead, I want to implement, I hope we have the support. We have to make the change, we have to join the 21st century. Just as India has done, we have to go ahead and do the same, he declared. Highlighting specific initiatives, Wickremesinghe mentioned the introduction of Artificial Intelligence in schools and the establishment of an institutional framework for a digital economy. He also expressed gratitude for Indias assistance in the opening of an IIT branch in Sri Lanka, which will be the third foreign campus of IIT after Tanzania and the UAE. Indian High Commissioner to Sri Lanka, Santosh Jha, underscored the collaborative efforts between the two nations in advancing digital infrastructure. He referenced to Indias support to the Sri Lanka Unique Digital Identity Project (SL-UDI), akin to Indias Aadhaar, as a symbol of this partnership. Both leaders agreed to leverage Indias DPI in accordance with Sri Lankas requirements and priorities, towards efficient delivery of citizen-centric services, explained Jha. Jha further emphasised Indias commitment to supporting Sri Lankas digital transformation, noting the inclusion of DPI in bilateral joint statements and vision documents.

        "content": "The petition filed seeking legal action against the former chief of the State Intelligence Service (SIS) Nilantha Jayawardena with respect to the 2019 Easter Sunday terror attacks has been fixed for consideration by the Court of Appeal on May 28. It was taken up before a two-member judge bench consisting of Sobhitha Rajakaruna and Dhammika Ganepola on Wednesday morning (27). The petition was filed by the Centre for Society and Religion (CSR), its director Rev. Fr. Jude Vernon Rohan Silva and a victim of Easter attacks named Devage Surach Nilanga, naming the Inspector-Genral of Police (IGP), SDIG Nilantha Jayawardena and the Attorney General as its respondents. The writ application was put forward requesting that an order be issued to the IGP and other respondents directing them to take legal action against the former SIS chief, over his failure to prevent the coordinated bombings five years ago, despite receiving intelligence information. The petitioners alleged that the respondents have yet to take legal action against Jayawardena, despite sufficient evidence supporting the fact that he failed to prevent the attacks. As such, they have requested the Appeals Court to deliver an order instructing the respondents to implement the recommendations of the Presidential Commission of Inquiry (PCoI) on Easter Sunday attacks. The petitioners also have sought a writ order calling for the arrest of Jayawardena under the Criminal Law and subsequent legal action against him.",

        "date": "March 27, 2024 02:13 pm",
        "content": "Indias Tamil Nadu government informed Madras High Court on Tuesday that Sri Lankan deputy high commission has issued temporary travel documents to three convicts in the Rajiv Gandhi assassination case - Sriharan alias Murugan, Robert Payas and Jayakumar. They will be deported to Sri Lanka within a week or once the deportation orders are issued by Foreigners Regional Registration Office (FRRO), additional public prosecutor R Muniyapparaj informed a division bench of Justices R. Sureshkumar and K. Kumaresh Babu. The submissions were made in response to a plea by Murugan seeking direction to the authorities of foreigners camp at Trichy to issue him a photo identity certificate. However, recording the submissions, the bench said: At this stage, the question of issuing any separate identity card as sought for in this writ petition does not arise. We feel that no order is required to be passed in this writ petition as per the prayer sought for herein to give a direction to the authorities to issue an identity card to the petitioner. Disposing of Murugans petition, the HC bench said the travel document issued by Sri Lankan high commission to the petitioner itself is a valid document, based on which he can get the deportation order from FRRO, Chennai, and thereafter can travel back to his home country. The latest round of litigation initiated by Murugan pertains to his bid to seek asylum in the United Kingdom and to reunite with his daughter Mehara, who is a UK citizen and has completed her medical physics degree there. Ever since Supreme Court set them free on Nov 11, 2022, the four freed convicts were taken to a special campus in Tiruchiprison premises as they are Lankan nationals. After the death of Santhan on Feb 28, Murugan moved HC for travel documents from Sri Lankan deputy high commission in Chennai. As per court orders, the trio was escorted to deputy commission on March 13. Now that necessary travel documents have been issued, it is to be seen if they will be deported to Sri Lanka as informed by state govt, or they will move court again to avoid being sent to Lanka. Murugan has already made it clear that he faced threat to his life in Sri Lanka and that he would seek asylum in the UK and would strive to be allowed to leave for the UK from India itself. He has already applied for a UK visa with his wife Nalini, who is an Indian citizen. While she has already attended the visa interview and is awaiting a decision by the UK, Murugan could not attend the interview as he lacked the travel papers. Source: The Times of India",

        "date": "March 27, 2024 07:39 pm",
        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe, during an inspection tour, visited the John de Silva Memorial Theatre and the long-delayed National Art Gallery. Despite construction commencing in 2011, both projects remain incomplete, the Presidents Media Division reported. President Wickremesinghe instructed officials to expedite the opening of the National Art Gallery before the years end, emphasizing the need for consensus among artists and architects. He also pledged government support for financial allocations. Additionally, he highlighted the demand for high-standard, affordable theatres in Colombo, questioning if such facilities could be provided following the completion of the John de Silva Theatre. President Ranil Wickremesinghe stressed the importance of consulting dramatists before making final decisions on construction and maintenance projects. He directed the Ministry Secretary to explore options for reviving the Lumbini Theatre and the Nawarangahala to support the theatre and also instructed the Ministry Secretary to take steps to construct a drama theatre in Colombos Sudarshi Premises. Emphasizing the need to establish a national cultural zone encompassing the Nelum Pokuna, Kalabhavana, John de Silva Memorial Theatre, Museum, and related areas, the President instructed the Ministry of Cultural Affairs to prepare a comprehensive report on this initiative. Additionally, he urged officials to enhance Sri Lankas museum system to international standard and tasked them with identifying a suitable country for mentorship in this regard.

        "title": "UNP chairman refutes oppositions allegations of election delay",
        "date": "March 27, 2024 10:04 pm",
        "content": "United National Party (UNP) chairman, MP Wajira Abeywardena has vehemently refuted the claims made by the opposition about the possible delay of the forthcoming elections. He stressed that the election amendment bills recently tabled in parliament will not impact the prearranged schedule of the elections, which he said are set to duly take place in compliance with constitutional regulations. Abeywardena alleged that opposition factions lacking clear slogans are resorting to misleading tactics by spreading false propaganda about the intention of the government to postpone elections. The parliamentarian highlighted that the group led by the President possesses the resilience to confront the upcoming elections with vigour. Addressing a press briefing titled Collective Path to a Stable Country held at the Presidential Media Centre today (27), MP Abeywardena further commented: The country did not face bankruptcy due to incidents occurring in one two days. This situation has been evolving over a significant timeframe, marked by a prolonged war that required the allocation of national funds for purchasing weapons, thus sustaining the conflict for three decades. Consequently, the economy suffered a severe downturn due to this protracted period of warfare. Furthermore, a substantial financial loss amounting to trillions of dollars was incurred in 1971. The terrible situation in 1987 and 1988 resulted in significant loss of lives and severe economic repercussions. Victims included monks, police officers, members of other security forces, politicians, and individuals from various sectors. Professor Stanley Wijesundara from Colombo University was also among those who lost their lives. During that period, the nation mourned the loss of numerous journalists, religious figures, and highly skilled estate superintendents. It was amidst this backdrop that President Ranil Wickremesinghe advocated for a unified effort. He stressed the importance of setting aside differences and rallying together to promote national policies. Still, they are implementing within the parliament. The President has highlighted this policy in the decrees presented. Notably, some of the most robust financial control bills in Asia have been approved and enacted by the parliament, aiming to curb corruption and irregularities effectively. The legal framework now encompasses regulations concerning monetary transactions, ensuring fair treatment where no one can be labelled unfairly. It is important to note that our goal is to enforce the law consistently and without bias. Furthermore, the President is preparing to introduce additional special decrees to Parliament concerning the management of the countrys economy. Following Sri Lankas financial crisis, President Ranil Wickremesinghe announced a halt to money printing. However, measures were reluctantly taken to boost the countrys tax revenue. Despite facing numerous challenges, we remained committed to providing relief to the people. Insurance benefits were raised to Rs. 15,000, and government employee salaries were increased by Rs. 10, 000. Additionally, the Urumaya program was initiated to grant freehold deeds to two million individuals in the country. President Ranil Wickremesinghe has undertaken significant initiatives within a brief timeframe. Traditionally, presidents have served six or twelve-year terms in this nation. Yet, none have exhibited the level of action and achievement as the current president, particularly considering the challenges of managing a financially distressed country. Given these accomplishments, there is widespread support for endorsing him for the presidency in the upcoming election. Furthermore, it is crucial to strategize on how to leverage his capabilities in the future. Any deviation from this course could lead to a return to the era of shortages in fuel and gas cylinders. Hence, caution and meticulous planning are paramount. Certain groups within the nation are disrupting the prevailing political landscape and inciting divisive politics. To steer Sri Lanka towards freedom from domestic and foreign influences and elevate it to a prominent position in Asia, the Sri Lankan populace must act thoughtfully in this regard. As per the constitutional stipulations, the presidential election must be conducted before October 17, and a general election should also follow suit in compliance with the constitution. Regarding the election amendments, they are not proposed with the intention of postponing elections. The claim is made that opposition groups lack clear slogans, leading to their reluctance to hold elections. There is no necessity to delay elections, especially as efforts are underway to address the countrys financial challenges, which has left opposition groups without clear platforms. Over the past three years, the public has been deprived of the opportunity to celebrate the New Year. However, President Ranil Wickremesinghe has successfully fostered an environment conducive to New Year celebrations this time around. His efforts in bolstering the countrys economy have earned him the gratitude of the entire populace. --PMD",

        "date": "March 27, 2024 11:31 pm",
        "content": "Authorities have announced the largest cocaine shipment seizure of the year in the Caribbean Sea off Colombia after military ships and planes chased down a speedboat holding almost four tons of the drug. In a joint operation between the Colombian Navy, the Colombian Air Force and the Joint Interagency Task Force of the United States Southern Command, authorities seized the cocaine  said to be worth more than 113 million  from the vessel near San Andrés Isla, according to the Colombian Navy. The navy released dramatic aerial video of the chase, during which it said the crew of the suspicious vessel began evasive actions, throwing packages into the water. After a chase that spanned several miles, the boat  which was covering its cargo in a blue tarp  was finally intercepted, the officials said. Three Colombians, one Honduran and one Venezuelan who had been on board the speedboat were detained, and subsequent testing confirmed that the boat had been carrying 3,355 kilograms of cocaine weighing, or about 3.7 tons of the drug. Navy video showed officers offloading and arranging hundreds of packages of the seized cocaine, which officials said amounted to more than eight million doses that would not reach the streets of different countries, thus avoiding the impact on public health. The drugs, boat and five suspects were turned over to the Attorney Generals Office, the navy said. The Colombia-U.S. operation in the Caribbean Sea came just days after officials announced that a British warship and an American patrol aircraft had chased down a speedboat as its crew tried to flee and dump another cargo of drugs into the water near the U.S. Virgin Islands. About three tons of cocaine and other drugs were seized, the U.K.s Ministry of Defense said. Drug busts off the shores of Colombia are also common. Just last month, authorities on a search-and-rescue mission for two missing fishermen off Colombias Pacific coast instead found a semi-submersible vessel loaded with more than four tons of cocaine, officials said. The so-called narco sub was intercepted during a joint operation by the Colombian and Ecuadorian navies and the Colombian Air Force, the Colombian Navy said. Colombia produces about 60 of the cocaine found in the world. Source: CBS News -Agencies",
