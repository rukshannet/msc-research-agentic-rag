        "title": "US soldier detained in North Korea after willfully crossing border",
        "date": "July 19, 2023 08:59 am",
        "content": "The US Army has identified a soldier who crossed the demarcation line into North Korea as Pvt. Travis King, a cavalry scout who joined the military in January 2021. King was set to be administratively separated from the US Army after facing disciplinary action for assault, an Army official tells CNN. King had been on a Joint Security Area (JSA) tour as a civilian when he crossed into North Korea. US Forces Korea spokesperson Col. Isaac Taylor said on Tuesday that a US soldier willfully and without authorization crossed the line during a JSA tour. We believe he is currently in Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea custody and are working with our Korean Peoples Army counterparts to resolve this incident, Taylor said in a statement. There was no indication that King was trying to defect, a separate US official said. King had spent 50 days in a detention facility in South Korea after facing disciplinary action for assault, according to two US officials. He was held in a designated detention facility under the Status of Forces Agreement with South Korea, the officials said, which is an agreement that defines how US service members, their family members, and other Defense Department personnel are treated and processed in a foreign country, including its justice system. According to a summary of the agreement from US Forces Korea, pre-trial confinement can be at a US facility, but post-trial confinement is in a South Korean prison. It is unclear where King was held for his detention. Following the detention, King was set to be administratively separated from the US Army. One of the officials told CNN that he was being escorted to the airport to return to the US, but because the escorts could not go through customs with him, he was able to leave the airport afterwards. At the time of his rotation in South Korea, King was assigned to the 6th Squadron, 1st Cavalry Regiment, 1st Brigade Combat Team, 1st Armored Division out of Fort Bliss, Texas, according to Army spokesperson Bryce Dubee. Currently, King is administratively attached to 1st Battalion, 12th Infantry Regiment, 2nd Brigade Combat Team, 4th Infantry Division, Dubee said. King has no deployments on his record. His military awards include routine decorations provided to soldiers with his rank and experience  the National Defense Service Medal, the Korean Defense Service Medal, and the Overseas Service Ribbon. Before King was identified, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin confirmed that a US soldier had willfully crossed into North Korea, saying he was absolutely foremost concerned about the soldiers welfare. Were closely monitoring and investigating the situation, and working to notify the soldiers next of kin, and engaging to address this incident, Austin said at a press conference on Tuesday. State Department spokesperson Matt Miller said Tuesday that the department had not reached out to the North Koreans or any other governments, including China, and that the department was in the lead on the issue. We will stay in close coordination with them over the next hours, and if there are steps that would be useful for the State Department to take, we of course will not hesitate to take those, Miller said. The prospect of a US soldier being held in North Korean military custody comes at a time of fraught diplomacy and rising military tensions on the Korean Peninsula. A U.S. National on a JSA orientation tour crossed, without authorization, the Military Demarcation Line into the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea (DPRK). We believe he is currently in DPRK custody and are working with our KPA counterparts to resolve this incident, the UNC said. A US official told CNN the soldier appeared to cross the line into voluntarily. US officials say they are waiting to confirm his identity until his next of kin is notified. The Joint Security Area is the most recognizable part of the wider Demilitarized Zone between South and North Korea, and tours of the area are open to the public and organized by the United Nations Command. The JSA has been disarmed since 2018 after an inter-Korean military agreement, so both the UNC and North Korean soldiers at the area are unarmed. Neither the UN command soldiers or the North Korean soldiers are allowed to cross the military demarcation line separating North and South. The broader demilitarized zone (DMZ) is the buffer, 2.5 miles wide and 160 miles long, that separates North and South Korea. It has become one of the most heavily fortified borders in the world, ringed by miles of barbed wire and landmines and patrolled by soldiers from both sides for decades. But the Joint Security Area is a slightly different beast. While there are a series of checkpoints that must be passed to get to the JSA, crossing the Military Demarcation Line that is the actual border between North and South Korea does not require passing any physical barrier. There is only a small raised line on the ground that marks the border, and stepping across it requires only one step, as former US President Donald Trump did when he met North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in the JSA in 2019. During a JSA tour, participants are kept about 20 yards or so from the line Trump stepped across. Though there are guards on the South Korean side of the border during the tours, no guards were seen on the North Korean side when CNN took a press tour of the JSA last year. Frozen History The DMZ is a monument to the moment history was frozen at the end of the Korean War, which took place from 1950 and 1953. Under a deal between the belligerents  North Korea and China on one side, the collection of western allies on the other known as the United Nations Command  the Korean peninsula was roughly cut in half and a buffer zone created between the two. That deal was signed at the village of Panmunjom which became the JSA  the one area along the DMZ where the two sides could meet for negotiations and prisoner swaps. US soldiers are stationed on the South Korean side of the JSA because they were part of the original United Nations Command. Over the decades the JSA has seen sporadic bouts of violence between the two sides, including in 1976 when two US soldiers were bludgeoned to death by North Korean counterparts as they tried to trim a tree on the border. The JSA has also seen a string of successful and unsuccessful defection attempts from both sides over the decades. Rising Tensions Under leader Kim Jong Un, North Korea has been ramping up tests of potentially nuclear capable intercontinental ballistic missiles, something South Korea and its treaty ally the United States are keen to push back on. The same day the US national crossed the border, another moment of intense historic and strategic symbolism was taking place at the South Korean port of Busan  for the first time since the early 1980s a nuclear capable US submarine was making a port call. That visit came as Kurt Campbell, coordinator for the Indo-Pacific at the US National Security Council, was at the inaugural meeting in Seoul of the Nuclear Consultative Group (NCG). The NCG is a joint US and South Korean panel set up by the countries leaders at a summit in Washington in April. During that summit, US President Joe Biden and South Korean counterpart Yoon Suk Yeol unveiled a Washington Declaration that included a set of measures aimed at making Pyongyang think twice about launching an attack on its southern neighbor.

        "date": "July 19, 2023 09:45 am",
        "content": "The outpatient department of Lady Ridgeway Hospital for Children (LRH) in Colombo has launched a 24-hour token strike from 8.00 a.m. today (July 19). Speaking on the matter, the spokesperson of the Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) Dr. Chamil Wijesinghe mentioned that the strike was initiated in protest of the unacceptable and unprofessional conduct of a female specialist doctor at the hospital, which had remained a long-standing issue. Dr. Wijesinghe said the hospitals director has failed to resolve the matter by taking action against the specialist doctor in question despite the repeated complaints made by other medical officers against her. This compelled the association to bring the matter to the attention of Director-General of Health Services (DGHS) Dr. Asela Gunawardena, however, he too has failed to fulfill his promise to resolve the issue within seven days although three weeks have already passed, the GMOA spokesperson continued. Accordingly, a 24-hour token strike was initiated by the hospitals outpatient department, however, emergency treatments will be carried on regardless of the trade union action, the GMOA spokesperson said further. Speaking to Ada Derana, LHR Director Dr. G. Wijesuriya said he was not officially informed of the token strike taking place today. I am aware of it the token strike. But I was not informed. The hospital chief admitted that the conduct of the specialist doctor has remained an issue for some time as she is known for her rude attitude. He, however, noted that the doctors on strike do not work under the said specialist doctor. Steps have been taken to stop admitting patients to the ward, where the said specialist doctor is attached to. There is nothing else I can do beyond that. In any case, I have no authority to remove or transfer a doctor appointed by the Public Service Commission.",

        "title": "President urges Tamil MPs to decide on optimal solution for North  East issues",
        "date": "July 19, 2023 11:13 am",
        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe says he has already put forth a comprehensive proposal to address the problems faced by the people in the North and East, noting that it is up to the Tamil parliamentarians to decide whether it should be taken forward. This was mentioned during a discussion with Tamil parliamentarians representing the North and East on Tuesday (July 18), the Presidents Media Division (PMD) said. Wickremesinghe expressed his genuine intention to resolve the issues faced by the Tamil people without any political motivations. He elaborated on various bills and plans concerning the functioning of provincial councils, the Office of National Unity and Reconciliation, the Truth-Finding Mechanism, the Office of Missing Persons, and the development of the Northern and Eastern provinces. Furthermore, the president highlighted the governments development initiatives for the Northern and Eastern provinces, including projects focused on renewable energy, water supply, infrastructure development, investment promotion zones, and the tourism industry. Ultimately, the president underscored that the full enforcement of the 13th Amendment can only be achieved if all party leaders in the parliament agree to a comprehensive devolution of powers. The Presidents proposal and discussions centered around multiple measures to address the challenges faced by the people in the North and East regions. The president, reiterating his unwavering dedication to upholding justice for the people of the North and East, emphasized that any further actions taken for their benefit must receive the full support of parliament through discussion and consensus. Regarding the 13th Amendment to the Constitution, Wickremesinghe informed that extensive discussions had taken place on the proposals. While it was possible to grant all powers outlined in the proposal, except for police powers, he said the inclusion of police powers would require the agreement of all party leaders representing the parliament. The president also noted that a two-thirds majority in parliament was necessary for such decisions. Wickremesinghe discussed various bills concerning the functioning of Provincial Councils after the initial devolution of powers. These bills encompassed the appointment of Regional Secretaries, education, vocational training, higher education, agricultural innovations, industries, and tourism. The president assured that these bills would be presented to parliament. Under the 13th Amendment of the Constitution, the president emphasized the importance of legally announcing the transfer of decision-making powers on specific subjects to the central government. Regarding reconciliation efforts, the president revealed that the draft for the Office of National Unity and Reconciliation had been referred to the Attorney General for constitutional review and would soon be presented to parliament. Additionally, the National Action Plan on Reconciliation, drafted by the Office of National Unity and Reconciliation (ONUR), would be submitted to the Cabinet in the near future. In terms of the Truth-Finding Mechanism, the Head of State mentioned that the Interim Secretariat had been established with the appointment of the Director General. Applications for key staff required to facilitate the drafting of guidelines would be invited, and formal mechanisms would commence after relevant laws were enacted. Addressing concerns raised by Tamil party leaders, the president clarified that the government had not discussed or prepared for the merger of the Northern and Eastern provinces. He also stated that the government was reluctant to involve foreign judges in the administration of justice in the North and East but would consider obtaining reports from foreign observers, following existing systems in South and East Asian countries. The president engaged in extensive discussions about the Anti-Terrorism Bill and the activities of the Office of Missing Persons. Out of the 21,374 complaints received by the Office of Investigation of Missing Persons, investigations into 3,462 complaints have been completed thus far. Ongoing investigations are underway for the remaining complaints. In response to the Tamil MPs concerns that the complaints received by the Office of Investigation of Missing Persons did not provide complete information about missing persons, the president requested that detailed information be submitted for forwarding to the Interim Secretariat for the Truth-Finding Mechanism. The Head of State emphasized that the forthcoming anti-corruption law would undergo amendments by the parliamentary committee on July 19, taking into consideration the proposed amendments by the Supreme Court. Wickremesinghe provided clarifications regarding the governments ongoing development program for the northern and eastern provinces. He elaborated on the initiative to attract investment opportunities in the production of green hydrogen and ammonia as renewable energy projects in the North and East. The president further outlined the project aimed at enhancing the appeal of the Colombo port city through green hydrogen. One of the key objectives of the Northern Development Plan is to harness the regions renewable energy potential through the production of green hydrogen and ammonia. This strategy aims to attract investments and transform the port of Colombo and Pooneryn into a hub for the renewable energy economy. The president expressed his belief that this approach would lead to substantial growth in the sector. Additionally, the Water to the North project includes various developments such as the Poonekery Tank, River for Jaffna (bringing fresh water to Jaffna Lagoon and increasing the water capacity of the Iranamadu Tank), the Small Tanks renewal program, the development of KKS Harbour, the development of Vauniya and Palaly Airports, the Ferry Service connecting the Northern Province and South India, the establishment of Investment Promotion Zones in KKS, Paranthan, and Mankulam, tourism promotion in the North, and the enhancement of Jaffna as a university town. The president informed the East and North Tamil MPs about plans for the development of tourist attractions in Jaffna and Mannar, a tourist boating project around Mannar Fort and Kankesanthurai Island, the promotion of coconut cultivation in the Wanni district, and projects aimed at developing Jaffna as a university city. These initiatives are part of the governments efforts to boost the tourism industry in the Northern Province and create economic opportunities for the region. --PMD",

        "date": "July 19, 2023 11:27 am",
        "content": "Disgraced English language tutor Sakvithi Ranasinghe and his wife, who were accused of operating an unauthorized financial institution and misusing its deposits worth over Rs. 164 million obtained from the public, have pleaded guilty to the financial fraud charges. The revised charge sheet submitted by the Attorney General was read out when the couple was produced before Colombo High Court Judge Aditya Patabendi this morning (July 19). Accordingly, the accused pleaded guilty to the revised fraud charges levelled against them. The duo also agreed to pay off the sum of Rs. 164,185,000, which they had misused by swindling the depositors, in 20 monthly instalments of Rs. 5 million each. The defence attorneys told the high court judge that the first instalment would be settled today. The Attorney General had submitted a revised charge sheet against Sakvithi Ranasinghe and his wife who had misappropriated an amount to the tune of Rs. 164,185,000 by misusing the funds of the depositors of his illegal financial company S.R. Property Sharing Investment (Pvt) Ltd between January 01, 2006 and September 03, 2008. Ranasinghe started off as an English language tutor, and after gaining popularity he set up a financial institution that offered higher interest rates for depositors to invest their money. He is also said to have been involved in real estate business through his other company Sakvithi Constructions, which he used to buy and sell properties using forged deeds. The scam was busted by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka in September 2008 after looking into a multitude of complaints filed by the victims. Ranasinghe then fled to Chennai, India shortly after his scam came under the spotlight. However, upon his return to the island, the Mirihana Police arrested the scammer and his wife in August 2010. In 2022, the Colombo High Court handed Ranasinghe a 22-year rigorous imprisonment suspended for five years after the accused pleaded guilty to 11 charges laid against him. The accused was fined Rs. 25,000 for each charge. Meanwhile, his wife, who pleaded guilty to one of the charges levelled in this case, was given a two-year prison sentence suspended for five years. She was fined Rs. 25,000.",

Speaking at an event held in Colombo on Tuesday (18 July), Faris highlighted the importance of maintaining the ongoing programme, and the need for the people of the country to be informed in this regard. The journeys been travelled quite a bit, we a long way to go, but also theres been good progress, he said. He further noted that while Sri Lanka is currently in the phase of economic recovery, there still lie a few difficult decisions that need to be made on the path ahead. Some of have been made, but its now the time to do it, and do it right, so we dont have to do it again, Faris said with regard to the said difficult decisions. He also noted that Sri Lanka requires deep governance reforms that would address certain core issues in order to prevent another crisis from occurring. Highlighting the need for transformation of economic governance, Faris said, What happened in Sri Lanka was not a result of one to two years, one cycle to two cycles, this was years and years of build-up of policies that were not conducive to Sri Lankas strengths. The World Bank Country Director also revealed that a new four-year strategy was recently approved by the Banks Board of Directors last week, while USD 700 million was also approved for the island for the year 2023, with USD 500 million being given towards budget support and reforms, and USD 200 million going towards social protection systems. We expect to extend more resources this year to help in the financial sector, but thats a very good step, and thats based on some of the key reforms that have already been taken, he said in this regard. Speaking in regard to the recently approved Domestic Debt Optimisation (DDO) strategy, Faris urged that the process would happen as soon as possible, explaining that prolonging the process is only likely to further increase the risk.",

The Bill which was presented before the House on 06 July, was passed in Parliament this morning without a vote. The Bill was presented before the Parliament, with amendments, today, for the Committee Stage. Amendments proposed by the Minister and certain amendments proposed the opposition incorporated during the Committee Stage of the Bill today. The Second Reading debate of this Bill, which was presented to the Parliament on 27th April 2023 by the Minister of Justice, Prisons Affairs and Constitutional Reforms Dr. Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe, was held on 21st June and 6th July. The Bill was surrounded by much controversy, however, as several parties, including Transparency International Sri Lanka (TISL), had highlighted key concerns within the clauses of the Bill, stating that certain provision of the Bill in question are unconstitutional. Filing a petition in this regard, TISL challenged 37 clauses of the Anti-Corruption Bill in total, including clauses 28(3), 161 and 119, stating that they were disproportionate and could have a chilling effect on whistleblowing, the right to information and the freedom of expression, and could affect the concepts of transparency and accountability. Meanwhile, the Women Parliamentarians Caucus (WPC) also submitted proposals to amend the Anti-Corruption Bill. The Supreme Court had also determined that certain clauses of the Bill were inconsistent with the Constitution and therefore should be tabled after amendments. Delivering the Supreme Court determination, however, Speaker Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena stated that the said inconsistencies cease, if the amendments, as set out in the determination of the Supreme Court, are made to the Bill. The Additional Solicitor General also informed the Supreme Court that amendments to clauses 8 (3), 136, 141, 142 and 156 of the Bill, as set out in the determination, would be made in a bid to address several concerns raised by the petitioners. The determination of the Supreme Court was then printed in the Hansard report of the parliamentary proceedings on 06 June.",

        "date": "July 19, 2023 02:38 pm",
        "content": "The Tamil National Alliance (TNA) on Tuesday categorically rejected Sri Lankan President Ranil Wickremesinghes offer to implement the 13th Amendment sans police powers, terming his proposal for development and power devolution another hollow promise. The 13th Amendment is an over 30-year old Sri Lankan legislation on the devolution of power from Colombo to the nine provinces, but has never been fully implemented. If the government is not willing to implement what is already in our Constitution, it is a revelation of the lack of political will to go beyond the 13th Amendment, and meaningfully devolve power, TNA spokesman M.A. Sumanthiran told The Hindu, following a meeting convened by Mr. Wickremesinghe with Tamil political parties. We categorically rejected the Presidents proposal, the Jaffna MP said. The meeting and the Presidents position on the 13th Amendment assume significance ahead of Mr. Wickremesinghes scheduled visit to India on July 21. India has consistently underscored full implementation of the legislation, which was enacted after the Indo-Lanka Accord of 1987. It remains the only legislative guarantee of some power devolution, following the Sri Lankan Tamils historic demand for the right to self-determination. However, the 13th Amendment seeks to devolve power to all nine provinces, incuding seven that have Sinhala-majority populations. Successive governments in Colombo have refused to part with land and police powers in the provinces. Meanwhile, the military is visibly present in the Tamil-majority north and east till date, 14 years after the civil war ended. Looking ahead At Tuesdays meeting, President Wickremesinghe shared an elaborate dossier with the Tamil leadership, outlining his governments plans in regard to truth-seeking mechanisms, reconciliation, accountability, development, and power devolution. Developmental plans listed included several projects promised in the past, such as upgrading the Palaly Airport and Kankesanturai Harbour in Jaffna, and the much-discussed, still-pending plan to establish ferry connectivity between south India and northern Sri Lanka. No police powers A small section in the 16-page dossier that dealt with devolution said that the 13th Amendment would be implemented with the exception of police powers. Further, it listed out Bills to be presented to Parliament, on various administrative matters, and to empower provincial councils to set up universities, modernise agriculture, and promote tourism. Some of the subjects and functions devolved to the Provincial Councils are still administered under the Central Government. Legislation may be required to ensure that such subjects come under the purview of the provincial councils, read the document shared by the Presidential Media Division. Hollow promises TNA MPs who attended the meeting termed the promises familiar and hollow, while pointing out that Sri Lankas provincial councils have been defunct for five years now, with no sign of provincial elections. All nine provinces in Sri Lanka are under the rule of their respective Governors, who represent the President at the provincial level, after the terms of the Councils expired in 2018 and 2019. In addition to the TNA  which is the largest parliamentary grouping of Tamil parties in Sri Lanka with 10 seats in the 225-member House  legislators from other Opposition and government-aligned parties participated in the meeting as well. Meanwhile, leaders across the Tamil nationalist spectrum and civil society members have sent separate letters to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, drawing attention to the enduring concerns of the Tamil people ahead of Mr. Wickremesinghes visit. In a recent letter handed over to the Indian Consulate in Jaffna, the Tamil National Peoples Front, which holds two seats in Parliament, contended that the 13th Amendment, under a unitary constitution, was not even a starting point to devolution. They urged Mr. Modi to push for a federal solution instead. Crisis of confidence TNA leader and veteran Tamil politician R. Sampanthan, in a letter to Mr. Modi dated July 17, said that the many failed promises of Sri Lankan leaders, including to India and the international community, had led to a crisis of confidence. In total disregard of the pious promises and repeated assurances on its part, the Sri Lankan State has not only failed to fulfil its commitments, but has also attempted to abort the implementation of the 13th Amendment to the Constitution by resisting brazenly the continuous demands for the devolution of land and police powers and by misappropriating powers already enjoyed by the provinces by legislative manipulations, the 90-year-old leader noted in his letter. He urged the Indian PM to prevail upon the President of Sri Lanka when he visits New Delhi to fulfil the commitments made to India with regard to sharing powers of governance with the Tamil People of the North-East in Sri Lanka, without any further delay.

        "content": "The police have arrested three individuals on suspicion of their complicity in the shooting incident in which a 62-year-old was killed early this morning (July 19). The victim died on the spot after being gunned down at his residence in the area of Kokgalla in Amabalantota. Speaking on the matter, police spokesperson SSP Nihal Thalduwa confirmed that the deceased did not have any criminal record. However, an individual accused of being involved in illegal cattle slaughtering had been living in his house. This person had not been home at the time of the incident. Meanwhile, the victims son is believed to have been targeted by the gunmen, whose motive remains unclear. A personal dispute is suspected to be the main reason, the police spokesperson said. The perpetrators had arrived at the victims house shortly after midnight and had been looking through one of the windows. A small girl who was inside the house at the time had shouted in fear upon seeing them, prompting the victim to come out of the house and check. At that moment, the gunmen had opened fire on him before fleeing the scene. Two of the arrestees, aged 28 and 35, were residents of the same area. The other suspect, 32, is reportedly a resident of Gannoruwa. According to the police spokesperson, the gunmen have used two locally-manufactured firearms and have fired three shots at the victim.",

The medical officers at the LRH launched a 24-hour strike at 8.00 a.m. this morning (July 19) in protest of the conduct of a female specialist doctor at the hospital. Deeming the conduct of the specialist doctor unprofessional and unacceptable, the GMOA sought immediate solutions for the longstanding issue. Earlier, Dr. Wijesinghe said the hospitals director had failed to resolve the matter and take any action against the specialist doctor in question despite the repeated complaints made against her. This compelled the association to bring the matter to the attention of Director-General of Health Services (DGHS) Dr. Asela Gunawardena, however, he too has failed to fulfill his promise to resolve the issue within seven days although three weeks have already passed, the GMOA spokesperson had said further. The token strike was, however, called off after the Health Ministrys secretary promised in writing to probe the matter and to fulfil the requests made by the government medical officers.",

        "date": "July 19, 2023 04:17 pm",
        "content": "A special discussion pertaining to the issues that have arisen concerning the electricity bill sent to the Sri Dalada Maligawa in Kandy during the Esala Perahera season, will reportedly be held today (July 18) at Sri Dalada Maligawa premises. The Diyawadana Nilame (chief custodian) of Sri Dalada Maligawa, Basnayake Nilames of the Four Dewala, the Kandy District Secretary and several other representatives are scheduled to take part in this discussion, as per sources. The Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) had sent an estimated electricity bill of over Rs. 10 million to Sri Dalada Maligawa in Kandy, for the duration of the Esala Maha Perahera. Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa on Sunday (July 16) hit out at the government for the hefty electricity bill sent to Sri Dalada Maligawa, deploring the move as unprincipled and rude, adding that this unprecedented act is atrocious and a disgrace to Buddhism and the entire Buddhist community. However, when inquired by Ada Derana regarding the matter, the Diyawadana Nilame (chief custodian) of Sri Dalada Maligawa, Pradeep Nilanga Dela explained that the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) has been sending an estimated bill every year right before the Esala Perahera, adding that it is a usual procedure. He explained that before the commencement of the annual Esala Perahera, the estimated bill sent by the CEB is usually discussed with the Four Dewala and the Kandy Municipal Council before the payment is made. In previous years, the relevant payments were made after the conclusion of Esala Perahera, however, this year, the CEB has requested Sri Dalada Maligawa to make the payment before the commencement of the procession. The Diyawadana Nilame also said they have no issue with the CEB making such a request. Meanwhile, the first Kumbal Perahera of the annual Esala Perahera is scheduled to parade the streets on August 21 while the final Randoli Perahera is planned for August 30.",

        "date": "July 19, 2023 04:17 pm",
        "content": "Thailands constitutional court has suspended leading prime ministerial candidate and winner of Mays nationwide elections Pita Limjaroenrat from being a lawmaker, the latest setback for his hugely popular progressive opposition party following nearly a decade of turbulent military-backed rule. The temporary suspension follows a complaint filed by the Election Commission against the Move Forward Party leader accusing him of violating election laws for allegedly holding shares in a media company. Pita has denied he broke election rules and previously accused the Election Commission of rushing the case to court. Move Forward Party had pledged deep structural reforms to how the Southeast Asian country of more than 70 million people is run: changes to the military, the economy, the decentralization of power and even reforms to the previously untouchable monarchy. The May election, which saw a record turnout, delivered a powerful rebuke to the military-backed establishment that has ruled Thailand since 2014, when then-army chief Prayut Chan-o-cha seized power in a coup. The courts decision will likely add fuel to the fire of Move Forwards young support base, with the potential for mass street protests. The partys platform for change proved enormously popular with the party winning by far the largest share of seats. A group of opposition parties then formed a coalition aimed at forming a majority government and put forward Pita as a prime minister candidate. Pita, a 42-year-old Harvard alumnus, called the coalition the voice of hope and the voice of change and said all parties had agreed to support him as the next prime minister of Thailand. Establishments head start Last week Pita failed to secure enough parliamentary votes to become prime minister in a political system that was created by the previous junta and heavily favors the royalist, conservative establishment that has long held the levers of power in Thailand. In Thailand, a party or coalition needs to win a majority of 375 seats in both lower and upper houses of parliament  currently 749 seats  to elect a prime minister and form a government. But the conservative establishment has a head start. The unelected 250-member Senate was appointed by the military under a post-coup constitution and has previously voted for a pro-military candidate. Pita received just 324 votes out of the 376 needed for a majority and the kingdom is still without a prime minister as the political jostling continues. The court ruling now threatens his status as a lawmaker. Thailands powerful conservative establishment  a nexus of the military, monarchy and influential elites  has a history of blocking fundamental changes to the status quo. Over the last two decades, Thailands Constitutional Court has repeatedly ruled in favor of the establishment, dissolving several parties that had challenged the political elite. The military also has a long track record of toppling democratically elected governments and seizing power during moments of instability. Thailand has witnessed a dozen successful coups since 1932, including two in the past 17 years. Source: CNN -Agencies",

Detectives carried out the search at a home in Henderson, a suburb of Las Vegas where Shakur was gunned down in September 1996. Las Vegas Metropolitan police did not provide further details of the search, citing the ongoing investigation into his murder. Shakur was 25 when he was killed. No arrests have been made and no suspects are currently in custody. The home that was searched is less than 20 miles (32km) from the Las Vegas strip where Shakur was shot in a drive-by shooting. LVMPD can confirm a search warrant was served in Henderson, Nevada on July 17, 2023, as part of the ongoing Tupac Shakur homicide investigation, a Las Vegas police statement said. We will have no further comment at this time. Las Vegas Police Lt Jason Johansson told the Las Vegas Review Journal that detectives were working on the cold case once more. Its a case thats gone unsolved and hopefully one day we can change that, he told the newspaper. Shakur, whose stage name was stylised as 2Pac, released his debut album in 1991 and went on to enjoy chart success with hits including California Love, All Eyez on Me, Changes and I Aint Mad at Cha. He died on 13 September 1996, a week after he was shot four times in his car while waiting at a red light. Shakur, who sold more than 75 million records worldwide, was inducted into the Rock  Roll Hall of Fame in 2017. Source - BBC - Agencies",

        "date": "July 19, 2023 04:39 pm",
        "content": "Nissan and Renault will make an announcement in the coming days on their restructured alliance and have finalised the deal, three people familiar with the matter said, capping 10 months of sometimes tense negotiations. The automakers announced a framework agreement in February and had aimed to finalise negotiations as early as March. Under the framework, the Japanese automaker would take as much as 15 of Renaults new electric vehicle unit, Ampere, while Renault would reduce its 43 stake in Nissan. That timeline was extended when senior Nissan executives and some directors challenged detailed provisions of deal, citing the need to better protect Nissans intellectual property, Reuters has reported. The delay complicated Nissans drive to put its decades-long relationship with Renault onto a more equal footing. Nissan executives sought to rebalance the alliance built by former Chairman Carlos Ghosn after his ouster sent the automaker into turmoil. Nissan has been working to establish a lower threshold for its pledged strategic investment in the Renault unit that would be below the 15 maximum it announced in February, two of the people said. While the size of the investment ultimately hinges on the value of Ampere, Nissan is likely to take less than 10, one of them said. All of the people declined to be identified because the information is not public. Nissan and Renault are engaged in constructive and ongoing negotiations. We will make a statement in due course when the agreements are concluded, the Japanese company said in a statement. Renault declined to comment. The French automaker has said it expects to list Ampere in an initial public offering in the first half of 2024. Sources have said the unit could be valued at up to 10 billion euros (11.2 billion). IP CONCERNS Renault wants to attract more investors to Ampere, given the massive investment required for connected cars. Nissan and Renaults junior partner, Mitsubishi Motors, has also indicated it may invest in the company. U.S. chip giant Qualcomm has already said it will invest. Discussions have focused on how to deal with future IP - including technology that may not yet exist, one of the people said. A Mitsubishi spokesperson said it was still considering investing in Ampere but that nothing had been decided. Talks have also been delayed as Nissans board has been forced to deal with a claim that Chief Executive Makoto Uchida carried out surveillance of his then-deputy, Ashwani Gupta, after Gupta voiced opposition to some terms of the new partnership with Renault, Reuters has reported. Gupta, who had been chief operating officer and was widely seen as a candidate to become Nissans CEO, left Nissan in June. The board has not heard the final report on the surveillance claim, according to the three people. By closing out the restructured Renault deal, Nissan executives have the opportunity to pivot to other challenges, including a medium-term strategy update and a change in approach to China, where Nissans sales, and those of other global automakers, are in decline.

        "date": "July 19, 2023 04:56 pm",
        "content": "The Sri Lankan government and World Bank, European Union (EU) and Agence Française de Développement (AFD) have recently signed financing agreements to help strengthen Sri Lankas management of public finances. In a statement, the World Bank said the grant of EUR 9.8 million for Public Finance Management aims to support improving economic governance, transparency, and accountability in how public finances are spent. Weak management of public finances contributed to Sri Lankas economic crisis, so it is crucial to strengthen core public finance institutions and systems to shore up the economic recovery and get the country on a sustainable growth path, said Chiyo Kanda, World Bank Country Manager for Maldives, and Sri Lanka. This project will leverage technology to develop and scale up the governments nascent e-procurement system (e-GP) and enhance the institutional capacity of the National Audit Office of Sri Lanka, both important steps towards enhancing efficiency and transparency in public procurement and external audits, Kanda said further. Pointing out that the public sector is the largest purchaser of goods, works, and non-consulting services in Sri Lankas domestic market, the World Bank noted that the procurement of these goods and services is often delayed due to cumbersome and outdated procedures and processes, limited understanding of market approaches, and lack of capacity and empowerment of procurement decision-makers. In the absence of digitized procurement tools and an efficient e-procurement system, Sri Lanka misses out on opportunities to leverage economies of scale and to monitor the efficiency and timeliness of procurement, said Denis Chaibi, Ambassador of the European Union to Sri Lanka and the Maldives. Chaibi also stressed on the importance of a strong and modernized public finance management system for the country to mitigate the risk of crises in the future and to establish accountability and public trust in the system. The European Unionthrough the World Bankis pleased to support institutional capacity and transparency in Sri Lankas procurement and audit, which will improve economic governance and aid Sri Lankas recovery. World Banks statement said the project aims to strengthen the overall accountability framework by improving the performance of the National Audit Office of Sri Lanka in terms of stronger governance, greater accountability, and enhanced institutional capacity in areas relating to audit planning, quality assurance, staff capacity, engagement of citizens in the audit process, as well as in specialized audits such as procurement and environment audits. The project is aligned with the new World Bank Group Country Partnership Framework (CPF) FY24-FY27 for Sri Lanka. The CPF focuses on restoring economic stability and building a stronger foundation for green, resilient, and inclusive development. The projects focus on supporting economic governance and institutional strengthening is aligned with the CPFs goals and will support the Government of Sri Lankas governance reforms, the statement read further.",

        "content": "A two-phase mega campaign starting in early August and the promotion of hot air ballooning over pristine nature are among the key steps being taken by Sri Lanka to woo tourists from India and other nations in a bid to revive tourism in the cash-strapped country. Describing his country a resilient nation and a land of opportunities, Sri Lankas Minister of Tourism and Lands Harin Fernando urged more Indians to travel and explore the Pearl of the Indian Ocean as a 365-day destination that offers everything from adventure to beaches and scuba diving to cultural heritage in one capsule. According to data shared by the Sri Lanka Tourism Promotion Bureau (SLTPB), the country is targeting about 1.55 million foreign tourists arrivals by the end of this year, with a forecast of the figures rising to 2.5 million by 2024 and an aim of 4 million tourists by 2030. Chalaka Gajabahu, the chairman of SLTPB, said that as the island nations lay the roadmap for recovery and rejuvenation of the tourism sector, India is, and will for a long time, remain our number one market. India is a country with over a billion people and one of the strongest middle-class populations in the world. Definitely, one of Sri Lankas key markets, followed by China, which is a very similar market, he said. Sri Lanka earlier in July played host to the 67th annual convention of the TAAI (Travel Agents Association of India) with President Ranil Wickremesinghe being the chief guest at its opening ceremony in Colombo. Wickremesinghe will travel to India on an official visit from July 20-21 to further advance and consolidate the long-standing bilateral relations between the two countries. Fernando, at a dinner reception held on the second day of the TAAI convention here, told a gathering of nearly 600 delegates, India hamare dil ke paas hai (India is close to our heart). India and Sri Lanka, we are connected in more ways than one. Sethusamudram is a good example, he added. We both have shared history and heritage going back to thousands of years. We look alike, have similar food, dance...a long way, we can go together. Thank you for supporting Sri Lanka, its your home away from home, the tourism minister said. He shared that the last good year for Sri Lanka in terms of tourism was in 2018 when it saw the arrival of 2.3 million foreign tourists. In 2022, international tourist arrival figures stood at 719,978 -- a 270.2 per cent increase compared to the 194,495 tourists who visited in 2021, according to the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority (SLTDA). We have achieved about 600,000 by June 30 this year in terms of the arrival of tourists. Our last years figure was about 7,20,000. So, we are almost achieving our target in just six months, and our target is 1.55 million (for 2023), but we are confident that we can reach there, its a bit of an ambitious figure, Gajabahu, the SLTPB chairman, had said in an interaction during the convention. The 2018 figure was the highest, 2.3 million, so imagine if we can get to 2 million, its a massive recovery, he added. In terms of recovery for tourism, it is very clear, without a proper campaign one cant take the vision forward. So, a little bit that was done earlier, starting with India, then China, then in London, followed by Germany, Middle East, where travel roadshows were done, and the numbers are coming in, the SLTPB chairman said. The other key markets for Sri Lanka include France, Australia, Scandinavian nations, Russia, Japan and South Korea. We are going to look at these key 9-10 markets, India being number one. There will be a two-month campaign starting in early August or late July, to rejuvenate and revive Sri Lanka (tourism). It will be 100 per cent through PR and social media with a 360-degree approach, Gajabahu said. In phase one, the focus will be on informing travellers that Sri Lanka is safe and ready to welcome visitors, a step that will also seek to nullify the negative publicity, officials said. After 15 years, we are going to come up with our first 360-degree campaign. Not a category-target campaign, but a full force campaign.. targeting 12 key markets, India is going to be our biggest market, and our biggest budget will be spent on India, followed by China, Gajabahu added. In September and October, we are going to come up with thematic campaigns, which is about what Sri Lanka is, and what it stands for. A lot of people still think we are just sun and sea. We are an island. We are all in one capsule, minus the snow, the SLTPB chairman said. Phase two will involve inspiring global campaigns on three pillars -- compact, diversity and authenticity. Gajabahu cited the example of the Incredible India campaign of Indias Ministry of Tourism, which was formed two decades ago, saying, first, the need is to create a mother brand of Sri Lanka. Incredible India, is a DNA, and not just a tagline, and what a successful brand it is, he said. So, that is our task, to create the blueprint, so it wont change, he asserted, adding that governments change, chairman changes, minister changes, but the brand should stay. So, wait till August, you will see the campaign come out, and the main campaign in September and October, an excited Gajabahu said. Fernando said that as part of the efforts to revive tourism in the cash-strapped nation, a number of new projects were on the anvil. In October, we are launching Sri Lanka as a diving destination. There are more than 148 shipwrecks around Sri Lanka. We are starting a skydiving school. We are starting ballooning, we have already four hot air balloons, and we are going to promote it, you can go to Yalla, and have an aerial view of the wild, so there is so much of high-end tourism that can be done, he said. In his address, he also added that yacht parks will be starting from places like Galle and Colombo. He spoke about chartered flights and an ITC hotel coming up soon in Colombo. Fernando said the Galle Literary Festival is coming up that will take place some days before the Jaipur Literature Festival, and Sri Lanka is expecting to attract those foreigners too who will visit India for the Jaipur Literary Festival. The debt-ridden nation is facing its worst economic crisis since independence from the British in 1948, due to a shortage of foreign exchange reserves. The tourism sector is the main source of foreign exchange earnings for cash-strapped Sri Lanka. However, the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 severely crippled the tourism sector and was one of the major reasons for Sri Lankas economic travails apart from the 2019 Easter bombings that had already impacted inbound tourism in Sri Lanka. The island nation is now making comprehensive efforts to recover from the crisis and rebuild the economy, the SLTPB said, asserting that it was ready to conquer any challenge and conquer the crisis. Cricket legend and the brand ambassador of Sri Lanka Tourism, Sanath Jayasuriya, in an interview with PTI earlier this month had said that to forge the way ahead in the field of tourism, it will take a good mix of both pinch-hitting and long-haul innings. Both Fernando and Gajabahu cited cricket analogy to express their optimism on the road to recovery and said, the Asia Cup matches starting in September will draw in tourists too. Nine matches of the Asia Cup will be played in Sri Lanka, including two India vs Pak matches. Its a great opportunity to promote our destinations, Gajabahu said. Fernando said that Sri Lanka is promoting tourism but with its own sense of identity. We are not Singapore, we are not Bangkok, we are not Malaysia, we are not Vietnam, we are Sri Lanka. We have our own identity, and we like to play hard, the Sri Lankan tourism minister said. Source  PTI -Agencies",

He said that the policy decisions should be taken without delay for the upliftment of the low-income people and pointed out that the country had to face many economic problems in the past due to the failure to take proper policy decisions, the Presidents Media Division reported (PMD). Ratnayaka expressed these views during the discussion held at the Presidential Secretariat yesterday (18) regarding the active participation of government officials in the Aswesuma social welfare benefit program, the PMD said. The progress of the Aswesuma social welfare benefit payment program so far was reviewed and Ratnayaka instructed the officials to provide those benefits to everyone registered for kidney, disabled and elderly allowances. Ratnayaka explained the need to formalize the identification of beneficiaries in the implementation of the Aswesuma Social Welfare Program, which was introduced to replace the Samurdhi Development Program for low-income families, and sought the support of Samurdhi Development Officers, according to the PMD. It was discussed at length about expediting the work of identifying the deserving persons by settling the appeals and objections received so far for the Aswesuma program with the participation of Samurdhi Development Officers who had left this program. Ratnayaka also pointed out the importance of advancing this program in a timely manner using modern technology, it added. Minister of State for Finance Shehan Semasinghe, Minister of State for Social Empowerment Anupa Pasqual, Governor of the North Western Province Lakshman Yapa Abeywardena, Director General of Samurdhi Development R.P.B.

        "content": "A new policy will be formulated to address the ongoing elephant-human conflict Minister of Wildlife and Forest Resources Conservation Pavithradevi Wanniarachchi says. The lawmaker said she hopes to address the issue with a program with short-, medium- and long-term goals. By incorporating the previous efforts carried out to manage the conflict human-elephant conflict, it is required to establish a permanent strategy for this, Wanniarachchi pointed out, adding that the new policy would be turned into a law subsequently. The lawmaker is confident that by doing so, the human-elephant conflict can be permanently resolved. Speaking further, Wanniarachchi said the habitats and paths of wild elephants are occupied by people for various development activities, noting that the population of the country is growing day by day. She added that 80 of the land in the country is owned by the government while 20 is owned by the public. Some have accepted that the elephant fence is a solution to prevent wild elephants from invading villages. Given the current financial situation of the country, it will take some time to complete these activities. The minister also spoke of the prompt steps taken by the Wildlife Department to treat Agbo the elephant immediately after learning of its injuries. Even now, doctors are continuing to treat the elephant. So far, no financial or medical problems have arisen related to the treatment of the elephant. As a result, nobody should raise an issue involving the Agbo elephant. I should mention here that the government is making every effort to preserve the elephants life. The minister expressed these views on Wednesday (July 19) during a press conference themed Collective Path to a Stable Country held at the Presidential Media Centre (PMC).",

        "date": "July 20, 2023 09:24 am",
        "content": "Merrill J. Fernando  the founder and former CEO of Sri Lankas largest and most global tea brand Dilmah Tea  passed away on Thursday (July 20). The iconic businessperson was aged 93 at the time of his demise. Born in 1930 in Negombo, Fernando received his primary education from Maris Stella College and his secondary education from St. Josephs College in Colombo. In 1954, at a time when the islands tea trade was still under the control of the British, Fernando began working as a tea assistant with Arthur Frederick Jones and his son Dennis Jones at AF Jones  Co. Fernando was amongst the first group of Ceylonese to be permitted to learn tea tasting. Four years later, Fernando was appointed the companys Managing Director. However, in 1962, he stepped down from AF Jones  Co. and started Ceylon Tea Services Company. Later that year, he established Merrill J. Fernando Company and exported bulk tea to Russia, USA, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Libya, Egypt and Saudi Arabia. In 1982, Fernando established Ceylon Tea Services Ltd., floated as a public company on the request of the government to support a fledgling Colombo Stock Exchange. Three years later, in 1985, Sri Lankas first valued added Ceylon tea brand Dilma was launched with Australia-based Mauri Foods. Dilmah Tasting and Packing Factory was awarded ISO 9002 Certification in 1994. Reaffirming his commitment to the companys philosophy Business is a Matter of Human Services, Fernando in 2003 established the MJF Charitable Foundation through which thousands of children, young women and men, impoverished adults, farmers, and war widows received help. The MJF Charitable Foundation undertook its first major relief effort, with the Small Entrepreneur Programme benefiting survivors of the 2004 tsunami disaster. The project has gone on to empower over 2,000 start-up businesses. In 2015, the renowned teamaker was named an Honouree of the Oslo Business for Peace Award, chosen by a committee of Nobel laureates for ethical and sustainable business. A year later, he was named Global Businessman at the Sri Lankan of the Year Awards and was honoured with FIRST Award for Responsible Capitalism for improving the lives of underprivileged children and deprived communities. Staying true to his pledge made in 2014, Fernando also turned Dilmah into a carbon-neutral facility in 2017. The same year, he was recognized by Business Today in the Passionate 2017 list of Sri Lankans. In 2018, the Dilmah Tea founder was honoured by World Chefs with Lifetime Achievement Award. He was also honoured by the International Chamber of Commerce in Sri Lanka as one of the three Most Admired Leaders and Dilmah as one of Sri Lankas Most Admired Companies. In 2019, Fernando was bestowed with the Deshamanaya title at the recent National Honours Ceremony presided by former President Maithripala Sirisena. Later that year, he was capped as a Doctor of Science by Massey University in New Zealand.",

        "date": "July 20, 2023 10:07 am",
        "content": "The nine-member Sri Lankan delegation led by the Attorney General has held fruitful talks with the lawyers representing the ship-owner interests of fire-ravaged freight ship MV X-Press Pearl and the vessels insurers earlier this week, the Presidents Media Division (PMD) says. During the course of these discussions held on July 18 and 19 in Singapore, the two sides have addressed the key aspects of the incident and its aftermath. The meeting was convened in response to a request made by the lawyers on behalf of their clients following the Sri Lankan governments claims action filed in Singapore back in April. A key focus of the talks was to assess the outstanding interim claims put forth by Sri Lankas Marine Environment Protection Authority (MEPA) and the Ministry of Fisheries, the PMD says. In response to their concerns, the Sri Lankan delegation received assurance from the ship-owner interests insurers that the assessment of these claims would be conducted promptly and efficiently. Furthermore, the Attorney General, representing the Sri Lankan government, emphasized the urgency of concluding the ongoing wreck decommissioning and debris recovery works within Sri Lankan waters. In response to this plea, the insurers of the ship owner responded positively, indicating their cooperation in addressing this issue. Notably, the ship-owner interests also expressed their willingness to consider the claims made by the Sri Lankan government concerning the damage caused to the marine environment. They have shown openness to further discussions with the Government of Sri Lanka in the near future. The PMD clarified that these discussions would have no bearing on the ongoing legal proceedings initiated in Singapore by the Sri Lankan government, which are already underway. The PMD also said these talks mark a significant step in resolving the aftermath of the X-Press Pearl Incident and indicate a cooperative approach by all parties involved. As the assessment of outstanding claims and environmental damage claims progresses, both the Sri Lankan government and the ship-owner interests hope to reach a fair resolution that takes into account the environmental impact and the interests of all stakeholders. The Singapore-flagged X-Press Pearl vessel was gutted in a fire nearly 16km off the coast of Colombo on May 20, 2021. Fire aboard a freight ship was found to be the result of a reaction of the chemicals being transported on the ship, from which 25 crew members were evacuated safely. At the time of the incident, it was transporting at least 1,500 containers including 25 tonnes of nitric acid, other chemicals and low-density polyethylene pellets. The fire that raged for nearly two weeks resulted in a massive spillage of damaged containers, microplastics, plastic pellets, chemicals and other harmful substances into the sea before the wreckage of the vessel sank on June 02, 2021, while being towed away to deeper waters. This is known as Sri Lankas worst maritime disaster to date.",

        "date": "July 20, 2023 10:27 am",
        "content": "Hundreds of protesters stormed the Swedish embassy in central Baghdad in the early hours of Thursday morning, scaling its walls and setting it on fire in protest against the expected burning of a Koran in Sweden. All Baghdad embassy staff were safe, the Swedish foreign ministry press office said in a statement, condemning the attack and highlighting the need for Iraqi authorities to protect diplomatic missions. Thursdays demonstration was called by supporters of Shiite cleric Muqtada Sadr to protest the second planned Koran burning in Sweden in weeks, according to posts in a popular Telegram group linked the influential cleric and other pro-Sadr media. Sadr, one of Iraqs most powerful figures, commands hundreds of thousands of followers whom he has at times called to the streets, including last summer when they occupied Baghdads heavily-fortified Green Zone and engaged in deadly clashes. Swedish news agency TT reported on Wednesday that Swedish police granted an application for a public meeting outside the Iraqi embassy in Stockholm on Thursday. The application says the applicant seeks to burn the Koran and the Iraqi flag, TT reported. A series of videos posted to the Telegram group, One Baghdad, showed people gathering around the embassy around 1 a.m. on Thursday (2200 GMT on Wednesday) chanting pro-Sadr slogans and storming the embassy complex around an hour later. Yes, yes to the Koran, protesters chanted. Videos later showed smoke rising from a building in the embassy complex and protesters standing on its roof. Reuters could not independently verify the authenticity of the videos. KORAN PROTESTS Iraqs foreign ministry also condemned the incident and said in a statement the Iraqi government had instructed security forces to carry out a swift investigation, identify perpetrators and hold them to account. By dawn on Thursday, security forces had deployed inside the embassy and smoke rose from the building as fire-fighters extinguished stubborn embers, according to Reuters witnesses. Most protesters had withdrawn, with a few dozen milling around outside the embassy. Late last month, Sadr called for protests against Sweden and the expulsion of the Swedish ambassador after the Koran burning in Stockholm by an Iraqi man. Swedish police charged the man with agitation against an ethnic or national group. In a newspaper interview, he described himself as an Iraqi refugee seeking to ban the Koran, the central religious text of Islam, believed by Muslims to be a revelation from God. Two major protests took place outside of the Swedish embassy in Baghdad in the aftermath of that Koran burning, with protesters breaching the embassy grounds on one occasion. The governments of several Muslim countries, including Iraq, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates, Jordan and Morocco issued protests about the incident, with Iraq seeking the mans extradition to face trial in the country. The United States also condemned it, but added that Swedens issuing of the permit supported freedom of expression and was not an endorsement of the action. Source  Reuters -Agencies",

        "content": "A shooting has left two people dead in the centre of Auckland, New Zealand, hours before the city is due to open the Fifa Womens World Cup. Six other people, including police officers, were injured and the gunman is also dead after the incident at 07:22 (19:22 GMT) on a construction site in the central business district. PM Chris Hipkins said the attack was not being seen as an act of terrorism. The tournament would go ahead as planned, he confirmed. While no political or ideological motive for the attack had been identified, police had neutralised the threat and the public could be assured that there was no ongoing risk, the prime minister said. He added that the gunman had been armed with a pump-action shotgun when he arrived at a construction site on Queen Street on Friday morning. Mr Hipkins thanked the brave men and women of the New Zealand police who ran into the gunfire, straight into harms way, in order to save the lives of others. These kinds of situations move fast and the actions of those who risk their lives to save others are nothing short of heroic. According to Auckland Mayor Wayne Brown, all Fifa personnel and football teams are safe and have been accounted for. Earlier, he had warned people to stay home and avoid travelling into the city. I cant remember anything like this ever happening in our beautiful city. This mornings events have been tragic and distressing for all Aucklanders, as this is not something that we are used to, Mr Brown wrote on Twitter. Fifa expressed its deepest condolences to the victims families and said it was in communication with New Zealand authorities. The participating teams in close proximity to this incident are being supported in relation to any impact that may have taken place, it said. The opening match is to be held between New Zealand and Norway in the citys Eden Park. Sport Minister Grant Robertson said there would be extra police in the area to provide reassurance. The ninth Womens World Cup is being co-hosted by New Zealand and Australia. Police said they heard reports of a person discharging a firearm inside the construction site, and the gunman moved through the building and continued to fire. The man then went into a lift shaft and police attempted to engage with him. Further shots were fired by the man and he was found dead a short time later, police said. Following the shooting there was a large armed police presence in the central business district not far from the waterfront and the fan park. Tatjana Haenni, chief sporting director for National Womens Soccer league USA, is staying close to where the shooting happened. She told BBC News she had woken up to sounds of police cars arriving and was told to stay inside. So far we feel safe, she said. Source - BBC - Agencies",

The land collapsed in the middle of the night in the remote mountain hamlet of Irshalwadi, in the western state of Maharashtra, about 60 km (37 miles) from Mumbai, officials said. Ten bodies had been recovered and more than 80 people had been rescued. It was estimated that at least 225 people lived in the hamlet, the states deputy chief minister, Devendra Fadnavis, told the state assembly. More than 100 of them were feared trapped in the debris. Rescue workers are having to trek in with their equipment for almost two hours to reach the landslide, some accompanied by sniffer dogs. They then have to labour in heavy rain and fog, occassionally dodging big boulders tumbling down the slope, in their search for survivors nearly 12 hours after the disaster, a Reuters witness and media reported. The debris at some of the places is 10 to 29 feet deep, S B Singh, an official with the National Disaster Response Force, told the Indian Express newspaper. It is difficult to bring in heavy machinery to this place. It is a 2.8 km trek to reach the spot and we have to remove the debris manually which is likely to take a lot of time. A landslide in a nearby village killed more than 80 people two years ago. Some pockets of the district, dotted with old forts and laced with trekking trails, received as much as 400 mm rain in the last 24 hours, according to the weather department. More rain was expected on Thursday but not as heavy, a weather department official said, and a red alert had been issued for the coast of Maharashtra and Gujarat state to the north, which has also been battered by rain this week. The rain has closed schools, flooded roads and disrupted transport in both Maharashtra and Gujarat. Flash floods, landslides, and accidents caused by heavy rain have killed more than 100 people in India since the onset of the monsoon season on June 1, mostly in the north which has seen 41 more rain than normal, the India Meteorological Department said. This week, the Yamuna river reached the compound walls of the Taj Mahal for the first time in 45 years, submerging several historical monuments and gardens surrounding the 17th century, white-marble mausoleum. In New Delhi, jammed flood gates and a broken drainage regulator let water from Yamuna flow into the city last week, inundating several areas including around the historic Red Fort, and Rajghat - a memorial dedicated to Mahatma Gandhi.

        "content": "The Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) has moved a no-confidence motion against Health Minister Keheliya Rambukwella today (20), over what it said was the irresponsible import of substandard medicines and surgical equipment which led to a weakened health sector and even deaths. The SJB alleges that the government continued to bring in the relevant substandard drugs outside of the procurement and registration process considering it to be a state of emergency, and that the move resulted in several deaths at major hospitals across the country. Taking the matter into consideration, the main opposition commenced collecting signatures for the relevant no-confidence motion to be presented to parliament against the Health Minister. The motion has reportedly been signed by a group of MPs including Ranjith Madduma Bandara, Lakshman Kiriella, Rajitha Senaratne and Kumara Welgama today. Commenting further on the matter, the opposition leader, emphasizing that the healthcare sector of a country signifies the lives of people, said the deterioration of healthcare sector adversely affects the lives of people. However, speaking during TV Deranas 360 programme on Monday (17), Health Minister Keheliya Rambukwella assured that he will not step down from his position solely due to the demands of a few people. He further assured that he does not intend to trivialize the matter at hand, and is instead ready to face those who are trying to attack the free healthcare system.",

        "date": "July 20, 2023 03:49 pm",
        "content": "Ahead of Sri Lankan president Ranil Wickremesinghes visit to New Delhi, Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M.K. Stalin has written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, asking him to raise two broad issues  the retrieval of Katchatheevu and the aspirations of the Tamil-speaking people in the neighbouring Island. A copy of the letter was shared with the media. Meanwhile, DMK MPs have requested the Union Ministry for External Affairs to arrange for a meeting with the Sri Lankan president during his visit to the national capital, sources said. Mr. Wickremesinghes visit to India on July 21, is to be his first visit since he assumed his current responsibilities last year. In his letter, Mr. Stalin recalled the history behind ceding the Katchatheevu islet to Sri Lanka in 1974, without the State governments consent, and contended that it has deprived T.N. fishermen of their rights and adversely impacted their livelihoods. He also underlined resolutions adopted in the T.N. Assembly towards the retrieval of Katchatheevu, emphasising the strong position of T.N. in this regard. Our fishermen face highly restricted access to traditional fishing grounds, increased harassment by the Sri Lankan Navy, and arrests by the Sri Lankan Navy on trespassing charges. Restoring the right to fish in the traditional fishing grounds of Palk Bay has always been among the top priorities of the Government of Tamil Nadu, Mr. Stalin said and urged the Union government to initiate diplomatic efforts to revisit the agreement transferring the islet. Pointing out the demands of the Tamil Nadu government and the DMK for upholding the rights and aspirations of the Tamils in Sri Lanka since 1956, Mr. Stalin contended: It is imperative to protect the social, political, cultural and economic rights of the Tamils in Lanka so that they can lead dignified lives as equal citizens of Lanka. For this purpose, there must be adequate and meaningful devolution of powers to the provinces, which fulfils the genuine and unresolved aspirations of the Tamils in the island nation. Highlighting the frequent harassment and apprehending of Tamil fishermen by the Sri Lankan Navy, Mr. Stalin recalled the T.N. governments constant demands that the government of India decisively use diplomatic channels to secure the immediate release of apprehended T.N. fishermen and prevent the recurrence of such incidents. Regular patrolling, establishment of communication channels, and installation of warning systems could significantly reduce the incidents of harassment and apprehension, Mr. Stalin suggested. He also proposed regular meetings and consultations of the Joint Working Group reconstituted in 2016, which he said would help in building trust, facilitate effective communication and ensure smooth fishing operations.

        "date": "July 20, 2023 05:28 pm",
        "content": "The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) will conduct training programmes for 300 Agriculture Extension Officers in Sri Lanka under an European Union (EU) funded project in order to boost Sri Lankas rice sector, the FAO announced. The programme comes as part of an innovative project titled RiceUP, launched by the FAO in collaboration with the Department of Agriculture and Mahaweli Authority in Sri Lanka (MASL), with funding of 4 million from the European Union (EU). The project aims at addressing the threat to food security caused by two consecutive seasons of poor harvests in 2021-2022. With a nearly 40 drop in paddy production in 2022, Sri Lankas rice ecosystem is vulnerable and requires immediate attention, the FAO mentioned. Accordingly, the FAO and its partners will conduct training programmes for Agriculture Extension Officers (AEOs) on Integrated Plant Nutrient Management (IPNM) in four districts: Ampara, Badulla, Hambantota, and Polonnaruwa. The training will equip them with the necessary skills and knowledge to guide paddy farmers on soil management and the optimal use of organic and chemical fertilizers to enhance crop yield while reducing chemical dependency. The initial training session for Agriculture Extension Officers (AEOs) on IPNM practices was launched today (20), at the Rice Research and Development Institute in Batalagoda, according to the FAO. This session marks the beginning of a series of five training programs, aiming to train a total of 300 AEOs from the selected districts. The Training Manual, developed collaboratively with international and national consultants, the Department of Agriculture, MASL, and the University of Peradeniya will serve as the cornerstone of these training sessions. IPNM is a sustainable land management practice that ensures soil quality, prevents degradation, and maximizes crop productivity while safeguarding the environment, it added, highlighting that the FAOs induction of IPNM, coupled with the provision of urea fertilizer to smallholder farmers in selected districts, is a response to the challenges faced by farmers in accessing essential fertilizers and maintaining food security. By adopting IPNM and accessing urea fertilizer, smallholder paddy farmers can reduce costs and improve productivity, leading to better profitability and resilience to future shocks, it said. Through the implementation of sustainable farming practices, including the safe and efficient use of fertilizer and quality seed, RiceUP aims to enhance productivity, food security, and livelihoods in Sri Lankas paddy farming sector, according to the FAO. Furthermore, FAO remains dedicated to ensuring the long-term sustainability and resilience of Sri Lankas agriculture sector together with its partners, it added.",

        "date": "July 20, 2023 07:38 pm",
        "content": "A North Korean government-backed hacking group penetrated an American IT management company and used it as a springboard to target cryptocurrency companies, according to two sources familiar with the matter. The hackers broke into Louisville, Colorado-based JumpCloud in late June and used their access to the companys systems to target its cryptocurrency company clients in an effort to steal digital cash, the sources said. The hack shows how North Korean cyber spies, once content with going after crypto companies one at a time, are now tackling companies that can give them access to multiple sources of bitcoin and other digital currencies. JumpCloud, which acknowledged the hack in a blog post last week and blamed it on a sophisticated nation-state sponsored threat actor, did not respond to Reuters questions about who was behind the hack and which clients were affected. A JumpCloud spokesperson said fewer than five customers had been impacted. Reuters could not ascertain whether any digital currency was ultimately stolen as a result of the hack. Cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike Holdings, which is working with JumpCloud to investigate the breach, confirmed that Labyrinth Chollima - the name it gives to a particular squad of North Korean hackers - was behind the breach. CrowdStrike Senior Vice President for Intelligence Adam Meyers declined to comment on what the hackers were seeking, but noted that they had a history of targeting cryptocurrency targets. One of their primary objectives has been generating revenue for the regime, he said. Pyongyangs mission to the United Nations in New York did not immediately respond to a request for comment. North Korea has previously denied organizing digital currency heists, despite voluminous evidence - including U.N. reports - to the contrary. Independent research backed CrowdStrikes allegation. Cybersecurity researcher Tom Hegel, who wasnt involved in the investigation, told Reuters that the JumpCloud intrusion was the latest of several recent breaches that showed how the North Koreans have become adept at supply chain attacks, or elaborate hacks that work by compromising software or service providers in order to steal data - or money - from users downstream. North Korea in my opinion is really stepping up their game, said Hegel, who works for U.S. firm SentinelOne. In a blog post to be published Thursday, Hegel said the digital indicators published by JumpCloud tied the hackers to activity previously attributed to North Korea. The U.S. cyber watchdog agency CISA and the FBI declined to comment. The hack on JumpCloud  whose products are used to help network administrators manage devices and servers  first surfaced publicly earlier this month when the firm emailed customers to say their credentials would be changed out of an abundance of caution relating to an ongoing incident. In the blog post that acknowledged that the incident was a hack, JumpCloud traced the intrusion back to June 27. The cybersecurity-focused podcast Risky Business earlier this week cited two sources as saying that North Korea was a suspect in the intrusion. Labyrinth Chollima is one of North Koreas most prolific hacking groups and is said to be responsible for some of the isolated countrys most daring and disruptive cyber intrusions. Its theft of cryptocurrency has led to the loss of eye-watering sums: Blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis said last year that North Korean-linked groups stole an estimated 1.7 billion worth of digital cash across multiple hacks. CrowdStrikes Meyers said Pyongyangs hacking squads should not be underestimated. I dont think this is the last well see of North Korean supply chain attacks this year, he said.

Speaking during a press conference themed Collective Path to a Stable Country held at the Presidential Media Centre (PMC) on Thursday (20 July), Amunugama revealed that new investment laws are expected to be introduced by the end of this year. Meanwhile, speaking on the Foreign Direct Investments (FDI) earned by the Board of Investments (BOI), the acting Minister noted that the target set by the BOI for FDIs for 2023 is USD 1.5 billion, of which USD 211 million was realized in the first quarter. The BOI has approved investments of USD 682 million from January to July 2023, he added. Despite the ongoing economic crisis, the BOI has been able to attract Foreign Direct Investments of 1.75 billion US dollars exceeding the targeted amount of 1 billion US dollars for 2022, Amunugama mentioned. Acting Minister of Investment Promotion Dilum Amunugama further commented; It is necessary to update and modify Sri Lankas existing legislative framework in order to make the country an investment-friendly destination. It is expected to introduce new investment laws by the end of 2023, without affecting other government entities current legal frameworks. Additionally, foreign investors do not receive their investment rights when they enter this country. As a solution, we must update our legislative framework to ensure that their investment rights are protected. A seven-member committee consisting of Director Generals of government institutions has already been appointed to look into the existing laws that restrict investments. The government intends to execute a program under concept of One Village  One Product to empower entrepreneurs who produce export-level products in selected regional secretariats, involving them in the export process, and scale it up at the District and National levels. A Central Export Center will be established for them and measures will be taken to strengthen the connection between the rural exporters and the Sri Lanka Export Development Board. In line with the governments proposal to cultivate cannabis for medicinal purposes, 200 project proposals have so far been submitted. The Minister of Indigenous Medicine Promotion has undertaken the task of amending the relevant laws.

Addressing a joint press briefing, he expressed his sincere gratitude to Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the government and people of India for their continued support during Sri Lankas most difficult times in recent history. Meanwhile, President Wickremesinghe also praised the impressive economic, infrastructure, and technological advancements made under Prime Minister Modis leadership. He emphasised that Indias growth would have positive impacts on both, the neighbouring countries and the Indian Ocean region. Reaffirming his dedication to achieving economic revival, sustainable development and justice for all in Sri Lanka, President Wickremesinghe engaged in discussions about a comprehensive plan for reconciliation and power-sharing, and thereby extended an invitation to all party leaders to reach a consensus. In response, Prime Minister Modi expressed his support and goodwill towards these initiatives. President Wickremesinghe also asserted that Sri Lanka is steadfastly pursuing economic reforms, which are already showing positive results in stabilizing the country. He further noted that the measures taken have led to a resurgence of confidence both within the nation and from external observers in the progress of Sri Lanka Highlighting the mutual agreement between India and Sri Lanka on a Joint Vision for their economic partnership, focusing on improved connectivity, the Head of State acknowledged the deep historical and cultural connections between the two nations, emphasizing that this presents an ideal opportunity for further enhancing connectivity in the future. The President also noted that while ferry services between Talaimannar-Rameswaram and Nagapattinam-Kankesanthurai will add more impetus to sea travel between India and Sri Lanka, other forms of connectivity between the two countries are being examined, as it could become a further catalyst to boost economic growth. Following is the statement delivered by President Ranil Wickremesinghe during the official visit to India; I am honoured to be in New Delhi at the invitation of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. This is my first visit to India since assuming office as President last year and it is a visit to which myself and my government attach the highest importance. I thank the PM Modi and the Government of India for the hospitality extended to me and to my delegation. This morning PM Modi and I had the occasion to review at length recent developments in our countries as well as in our bilateral relations. I have congratulated PM Modi on the great strides India continues to make under his leadership in economic, infrastructure and technological progress in ensuring growth and prosperity for the people of India. We believe that Indias growth will be beneficial to the neighbourhood and Indian Ocean region. I have also apprised with Prime Minister Modi of the extraordinary challenges that Sri Lanka had experienced in economic, social and political terms in the past year, and of the reform measures I have spearheaded on a number of fronts, in overcoming these challenges. I have conveyed to PM Modi and to the government and people of India our profound appreciation for the solidarity and support rendered to Sri Lanka in what was undoubtedly the most challenging period in our recent history. Friends, In reviewing recent developments in Sri Lanka, I shared with Prime Minister Modi my commitment to bring about economic recovery leading to sustainable and stable growth with justice and equity which will benefit all segments of Sri Lankan society in all parts of the country. In moving forward, I have explained that I have set Sri Lanka firmly on a path of economic reform and that Sri Lanka is already witnessing the stabilizing outcomes of these measures and the revival of confidence internally and externally in the progress of the country. I also shared with him the comprehensive proposal I presented this week for furthering reconciliation, power sharing through devolution and the multiple elements of the Northern development plan. I have invited all party leaders in Parliament to work towards consensus and national unity on these measures. Thereafter the Government will place the relevant legislation before Parliament. Prime Minister Modi has expressed his solidarity and goodwill in these endeavours. Friends, We now need to put our economy on a growth path bringing greater revenue for the country, which requires enhanced investment in all parts of the country. As a supportive and solid foundation for the realization of these objectives, we have agreed on a Joint Vision of the future India -Sri Lanka economic partnership through enhanced connectivity. Today, in this 75th year of our bilateral diplomatic relations, our Vision will propel us towards a more secure future through mutually beneficial interactions, to bring tangible benefits and greater opportunities for our future generations in the coming decades. The foundations of our joint vision of greater future connectivity have already been laid through millennia-old civilizational, cultural, human and commercial interactions between our two countries. The thread of connectivity is woven through our history. In our view, the present time is a most opportune moment to embark on such a vision for the future. We recognized that modern-day connectivity plays a crucial role in realizing our vision of economic partnership. The recent recommencement of Chennai and Jaffna air services is an important step towards air connectivity. We believe that expansion of aviation connectivity to other destinations and further development of Palaly airport will complement this initiative. Ferry services between Talaimannar-Rameswaram and Nagapattinam-Kankesanthurai will add more impetus to sea travel between the two countries. Examining other forms of connectivity between Sri Lanka and India could become a further catalyst to boost economic growth. We agreed that the Economic and Technology Cooperation Agreement between Sri Lanka and India is critical to enhance bilateral trade and investment in new and priority areas. Sri Lanka is pleased to welcome Indian assistance in digital tech driven service delivery and citizen centric services. We agreed that enhanced connectivity will also a play a crucial role in strengthening our cooperation in tourism, people-to-people exchanges and cultural relations. The tourism industry in Sri Lanka is poised to reap the benefits of the post-pandemic world and India is currently the top market for inbound tourism for Sri Lanka. Enabling UPI based digital payments in Sri Lanka would immensely facilitate further growth in this and other sectors. In keeping with Sri Lankas national priorities and global commitments towards a greener economy, and also to ensure energy security, Sri Lanka sees valuable opportunities in partnering with India in green and renewable energy development. In this context, I am pleased to note the conclusion of the Memorandum of Understanding for Cooperation in the field of Renewable Energy. Establishing the high-capacity power grid interconnection between Sri Lanka and India would enable two-way electricity trade between the two countries. The development of Trincomalee as an energy hub with the support of India is a crucial step towards Sri Lankas goal to elevate Trincomalee as a hub for industry and other economic activities. Prime Minister Modi and I believe that the construction of a multi-product petroleum pipeline from Southern part of India to Sri Lanka will ensure an affordable and reliable supply of energy resources to Sri Lanka. We also discussed how to improve our cooperation in the dairy and animal husbandry sectors to realize our common interest in achieving greater socio-economic development, and enhance the nutrition status of our people. Cooperation in the education sector is one of the key elements in our bilateral relationship. We believe that establishing new higher education institutes with the assistance from India is important. This will contribute towards upgrading the knowledge and skills of our youth and include them in the nations development drive. I believe that my visit to India has provided an opportunity to review our bilateral relationship, leverage the strength of geographical and civilizational links, and reinforce trust and confidence for our future prosperity in the modern world. I am confident that the discussions we had today will lay the foundation for the next 25 years of Indo-Lanka relations and contribute to my vision for sustainable growth national unity and reconciliation for all segments of the people of Sri Lanka and for a prosperous and secure future for the people of India and Sri Lanka.",

        "content": "India expects Sri Lanka to implement the 13th Amendment and ensure a life of dignity and respect for its Tamil population, said Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday (July 21). Welcoming Sri Lankan President Ranil Wickremesinghe to India, Mr. Modi informed that both sides have held talks on a number of infrastructure projects that can ensure greater connectivity between the two countries and announced a development assistance package for the Tamils of Indian origin who are marking 200th anniversary of their arrival into the island nation. President Wickremesinghe expressed his governments profound appreciation for the support that India extended to Sri Lanka over the last year which he described as the most challenging period in Sri Lankas modern history. We took up the issue of reconstruction and reconciliation in Sri Lanka. President Wickremesinghe presented his inclusive point of view to me. We hope that Sri Lankas government will fulfil the aspirations of the Tamil people. We expect that Colombo will take forward the process of reconstruction for ensuring equality, justice and peace. We hope that Sri Lanka will fulfil its commitment to implement the 13th Amendment and to hold provincial elections, said PM Modi delivering his remarks in Hindi. PM Modi and President Wickremesinghe spoke at the end of bilateral talks held at the Hyderabad House where the two sides exchanged documents on cooperation in the field of animal husbandry, renewable energy, development projects in Trincomalee district in eastern Sri Lanka, and online payment services between the two sides. The 13th Amendment is a three-decade-old Sri Lankan legislation that pledged devolution of power to the nine provinces which is yet to be fulfilled. Two days before the arrival of President Wickremesinghe to India, the issue came to the centre stage after the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) categorically rejected the promise of the present government to implement the amendment sans police powers. The TNA has described the move as another hollow promise by the Wickremesinghe-led government. We hope Sri Lankas government will ensure a life of respect and dignity for the Tamil people of the country, said PM Modi reminding that the community of Indian origin Tamils are marking the 200th anniversary of their arrival in Sri Lanka this year which is also the 75th anniversary of India-Sri Lanka diplomatic ties. PM Modi announced a package of INR 75 crores for various development projects in the northern and eastern part of Sri Lanka. PM Modi noted the financial difficulty that Sri Lanka has been facing since last summer when the country was brought to a standstill by an unprecedented energy crisis which was accompanied by high inflation and near depletion of its foreign currency reserve. PM Modi said security and development of Sri Lanka are connected to each other. We should work together while recognising each others security and developmental needs, said PM Modi. The two sides adopted a vision document to enhance maritime, energy and people-to-people connectivity. Mr. Modi announced that a passenger ferry service will be launched soon to connect Tamil Nadus Nagapattinam and northern Sri Lankas Kankesanthurai. We have decided to fast-track the work of connecting the electricity grids of both countries, announced PM Modi. He announced feasibility studies for building a land bridge as well as for a petroleum pipeline. Mr Modi informed that the two sides discussed the issue of fishermen and urged the matter should be viewed through a humanitarian perspective. Conveying his commitment to the development of Sri Lanka, President Wickremesinghe said that his plan will benefit all segments of Sri Lankan society and added, I have set Sri Lanka firmly on the path of economic reform and that Sri Lanka is already witnessing the stabilising outcomes of these measures and the revival of confidence internally and externally in the progress of the country. Mr. Wickremesinghe said he has invited leaders of all political parties to come forward to work towards consensus. The visiting President said Sri Lanka is focused on an economic growth path. He welcomed the Chennai-Jaffna air connectivity. Source: The Hindu",

The consignment had an estimated value of 850 million euros (946 million) and five people have been arrested, the Guardia di Finanza said in a statement. Police had been tracking a ship that sailed from South America and swooped in the early hours of Wednesday, when a surveillance aircraft spotted packages being thrown from its deck into the waters of the Strait of Sicily to be collected by a waiting fishing trawler. They stopped the trawler and found large quantities of drugs in a hidden compartment behind some panelling on the vessel. Two Tunisians, an Italian, an Albanian and a French national were arrested.

        "date": "July 21, 2023 10:55 pm",
        "content": "Amsterdams city council has approved a proposal banning polluting cruise ships as part of the citys latest move to clamp down on overtourism. A spokesperson for Amsterdam Deputy Mayor Hester van Buren, who has responsibility for the citys port, told CNN that the council approved a proposal on Thursday to close the citys cruise ship terminal. The center-left party D66, which sits on the council, said in a statement Thursday that the proposal was adopted with a clear majority. The municipality of Amsterdam will now investigate how to implement the proposal, according to van Burens spokesperson. This will include discussions with the managers of the North Sea Canal, the councils of other cities on the canal and the Dutch government. D66 party chairwoman Ilana Rooderkerk emphasized in the statement that polluting cruise ships do not fit with the sustainable ambitions of Amsterdam. Cruise ships in the heart of the city do not fit into Amsterdams goal of reducing the number of tourists, Rooderkerk added. Amsterdam is expected to receive more than 18 million overnight visitors this year. By 2025, that number could reach 23 million, in addition to another 24 million to 25 million day visits. Under a 2021 ordinance called Amsterdam Tourism in Balance, when the number of overnight visitors reaches 18 million, the council is obliged to intervene. Earlier this year, the city launched a campaign revamping its approach to tourism, notably including tactics designed specifically to discourage British tourists on stag parties. The online Stay Away campaign aimed to deter young British men planning to visit Amsterdam to cut loose and go wild, warning visitors between the ages of 18 and 35 of the consequences of of drinking too much, taking drugs or behaving antisocially. Amsterdam also announced this year that it would ban the use of marijuana on the street and take new steps to discourage alcohol in its red light district, the traditional center of the citys legal sex trade. This followed an announcement from the city in 2019 that it would end tours of the red light district, citing concerns about sex workers being treated as a tourist attraction. In its bid to limit tourism and prevent nuisance, Amsterdam also plans to restrict river cruises, convert hotels into offices and impose earlier closing times on bars and clubs. However, its unlikely the city center will become a cruise free zone anytime soon, the deputy mayors spokesperson told CNN, admitting the proposal will take some time to implement.

        "date": "July 22, 2023 09:10 am",
        "content": "China is drilling a new 10,000-metre-deep hole into the Earth with the hope of finding a gas reserve in its southern west Sichuan province. This will be Chinas second ultra-deep well, following the commencement of its first project on May 30 in Chinas western Xinjiang province, which is claimed to be Asias deepest well and is located in the petroleum-rich Tarim Basin region. Chinas largest oil and gas producer and distributor PetroChina Southwest Oil and Gasfield Company began drilling the new borewell called Shendi Chuanke-1 Well in Sichuan province on Thursday. The exploration of Chuanke-1 is a crucial component of the Deep Earth drilling project, which is a part of Chinas wider infrastructure project to provide an important foundation and support for Chinas future scientific research and oil and gas resource development, according to news outlet China Electric Power News. If successful, the project to find a gas reserve will boost the countrys energy security  a major challenge for the country in recent years due to geopolitical conflicts, shortages and price volatility. China is already the worlds fourth largest producer of gas and its export of gas now exceeds that of oil. It is seeking to fulfil its energy needs at home by 2025 under Xi Jinpings current five-year plan. Sichuan, a southeastern province renowned for its spicy cuisine, breathtaking mountain landscapes and pandas, also boasts some of Chinas most extensive shale reserves. State-owned oil giants, however, have faced challenges in fully harnessing the regions potential due to complexities in its rugged terrain and intricate underground geology. Ding Wei, the deputy manager of the project, said the undertaking will be crucial in gaining geological information from the depths of the Earth and building a first-class international and technical team in China. The 10,000-metre-deep exploration project is a major national project comparable to the lunar exploration project, Mr Ding said, according to China Electric Power News. He acknowledged the engineers would have world-class challenges during the drilling of the borewell due to the underground conditions and remote terrain. In May, China National Petroleum Corporation said it began drilling Asias deepest well, at a depth of 11,100m in Xinjiang. The project was dubbed an effort to study areas of the planet deep beneath the surface. The Kola Superdeep Borehole, located in northwest Russia, holds the title of the worlds deepest human-made hole, reaching a depth of 12,262m. Source: The Independent",

        "title": "Govt gives ultimatum to investors on resuming halted projects in Colombo",
        "date": "July 22, 2023 11:54 am",
        "content": "Steps will be taken to provide commercially valuable lands located in major cities in the country to investors in a bid to contribute to the economy, State Minister of Urban Development  Housing says. Arundika Fernando also stated that the government has informed the investors in writing to resume the projects on commercially valuable state-owned land in Colombo that have been halted midway due to the economic situation facing the country. Accordingly, the government has given an ultimatum to the investors demanding the resumption of the suspended projects, the lawmaker mentioned, adding that if the investors fail to a decision before the end of next month, these uncompleted projects would be taken over by the government and given to new investors. The state minister made these remarks addressing a press conference organized by the Presidential Media Centre (PMC) on Friday (July 21). Speaking on the properties with commercial worth in major cities, notably Colombo, the state minister said it has been decided to distribute them to new investors in a way that will strengthen the economy of the country. Currently, Hilton Hotel is a lucrative business. As a result, it has been agreed to safeguard employee rights as well as the Hilton hotel chains conventions and improve it in order to boost the countrys economy. Along with this, steps are being taken to transfer ownership of the Battaramulla-based Waters Edge Hotel to new investors. Additionally, a committee has been established by President Ranil Wickremesinghe to examine how these new initiatives would be carried out. Fernando said a decision was taken to grant investors access to 24 coastal regions that have been designated as tourist destinations, so that they can boost the national economy. New investors will be awarded temporary construction rights to those coastal zones. These zones must be formed with tourist-drawing beach activities, as in other countries. In addition, on the advice of President Ranil Wickremesinghe, steps have already been taken to develop Colombo, Ella, Nuwara Eliya, Kandy and Trincomalee as favourable tourist attraction areas. Some projects are being implemented with the assistance of the Asian Development Bank under the intervention of government agencies including the Urban Development Authority, the state minister added. Meanwhile, the construction of the Aruwakkalu Scientific Sanitary Garbage Dump under the Colombo Solid Waste Management project is scheduled to be handed over to the public by the end of January next year, he said further.",

        "title": "Biden chooses Admiral Lisa Franchetti to become first woman to lead US Navy",
        "date": "July 22, 2023 01:30 pm",
        "content": "US President Biden has chosen a female admiral to lead the US Navy - the first time a woman has been nominated to head a Pentagon military service branch. Lisa Franchetti is a former head of the US 6th Fleet and US naval forces in South Korea, and has also served as an aircraft carrier strike commander. Her nomination by Mr Biden must still be confirmed by the US Senate. One lawmaker is currently blocking the Senate from confirming military leaders to protest a military abortion policy. If confirmed as Chief of Naval Operations she will be the first woman to become a member of the elite group of senior military officers who make up the Joint Chiefs of Staff. A 38-year veteran, she was only the second woman to achieve the rank of four-star admiral. In a statement, Mr Biden hailed what he called her extensive expertise in both the operational and policy arenas and said she will again make history when she is confirmed for the role. According to reports in US media, Adm Franchetti was not the first choice of the US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin, who instead recommended TOPGUN graduate Samuel Paparo as the next Navy chief. Mr Biden also promoted Adm Paparo, nominating him to become the commander of the US military forces in the Pacific. The US Coast Guard is currently led by a woman - Admiral Linda Fagan - but that military branch falls under the Department of Homeland Security rather than the Department of Defense. Adm Franchetti is due to take up the position in the fall when the current chiefs four-year term expires. But she will begin the job in an acting capacity, as its unlikely that she will be quickly confirmed by the divided senate. Alabama Republican Senator Tommy Tuberville is currently blocking the senate from confirming more than 270 military promotions over a Pentagon policy that pays the travel expenses of service members who have to go out of state to have an abortion. In his statement, Mr Biden criticised the senator, saying what Senator Tuberville is doing is not only wrongit is dangerous. He added: He is risking our ability to ensure that the United States Armed Forces remain the greatest fighting force in the history of the world. And his Republican colleagues in the Senate know it.

        "date": "July 22, 2023 02:41 pm",
        "content": "Minister of Foreign Affairs Ali Sabry says that President Ranil Wickremesinghe has discussed Indias intervention for the progress of the plantation Tamil people who have been in Sri Lanka for about 200 years. Joining a press conference held at the Presidents Media Centre today (22), to announce the outcomes of President Wickremesinghes official visit to New Delhi, Foreign Minister Sabry detailed the agreements reached with the Government of India. The Head of State, on July 20, embarked on a two-day visit to New Delhi at the invitation of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. During the course of his stay, President Wickremesinghe held bilateral talks with his Indian counterpart Droupadi Murmu, Prime Minister Modi, National Security Advisor Ajit Doval and other top dignitaries. The minister pointed out that during the visit, attention was drawn to setting up a university in Nuwara Eliya, and also to establish Indian universities in Sri Lanka. Sabry further emphasized that it was agreed with India to acquire new technical knowledge required for agriculture, animal husbandry and dairy farming on the island, for which a Joint Declaration of Intent (JDI) was signed. Further, the banning of bottom trawling fishing practices in the northern sea areas, which have been going on for a long time, have also been taken up during the discussions, along with the decision to allow Sri Lankan fishermen to move to the Arabian Sea through the Indian Sea. Meanwhile, the foreign minister also expressed that an agreement was reached to work cooperatively in the Indian Ocean Region (IOR) so as not to threaten the mutual security. The two sides have also mulled using Indian Rupee (INR) in Sri Lanka as a valid currency, Sabry added.",

        "title": "CBSL urges banks to adequately reduce lending rates without delay",
        "date": "July 22, 2023 04:45 pm",
        "content": "Governor of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) has urged licensed commercial banks to take immediate measures to adequately reduce lending rates in view of the recent reduction of policy interest rates. Dr. Nandalal Weerasinghe, in a letter directed to the Sri Lanka Banks Association (SLBA) chairman, said the Central Bank would be compelled to take administrative measures in the event the banking and financial sector fails to take adequate and expeditious adjustments in this regard. Explaining that the central bank recently dropped the policy interest rates by 450 bps on two occasions with a view to enabling the economy to reach its potential while stabilising inflation at mid-single digit levels in the medium term and easing pressures in the financial markets, the governor said it is thus expected that market interest rates  particularly lending rates  will adjust downwards adequately and swiftly. It is also expected that the banking and financial sector will pass on this benefit to individuals and businesses, thereby supporting the rebounding of economic activities of the country and enabling borrowers to repay credit facilities which in turn enhances the asset quality of the banking sector, he added. The governor said the central bank has observed that the deposit interest rates of the banking sector have significantly been reduced while the lending rates continue to be downward rigid. Such rigidity of lending rates would be counterproductive in the process of envisaged economic recovery. In addition, faster normalization of interest rate structure would not only benefit the businesses and individuals but also the banking sector as well through the expected improvement in the quality of credit, he pointed out. Dr. Weerasinghe called for a concerted effort to reduce lending rates as it will enable individuals and businesses to re-commence or continue the repayment of credit facilities and improve the sustainability of borrowers which will lead to a positive impact on the real sector resulting in the banking sector performance to improve. According to the governor, the central bank strongly expects this will contribute to enhancing the resilience of banks, thereby enabling expansion of banking business in the period ahead. Hence, he urged licensed commercial banks to take measures to adequately reduce lending rates without delay.",

        "title": "Sri Lankas Vaulting Queen works as Dubai housemaid to support family at home",
        "date": "July 22, 2023 04:56 pm",
        "content": "A top Sri Lankan athlete who set national records in the pole vault has been working as a housemaid in Dubai to help support her family at home. For the last year Sachini Perera, 24, has put her athletics dreams on hold when Sri Lankas currency crisis and soaring medical bills made it difficult for her to look after her mother, who requires long-term care. It has been more than a year since she swapped crossbars and crashmats for a mop and bucket but Perera, called Sri Lankas Vaulting Queen by the media back home, continues to dream of winning gold. I feel this is my world now, Perera told The National in her first interview in English since she moved to the UAE in July last year. But step by step I will fly. I will work  one step, then the next  for my dream to fly again. She takes care of a young child and does the housework in a Dubai home during the day, setting aside time to exercise after work. She follows a weekly strength training schedule sent by her coach in Sri Lanka. I came to Dubai to find a solution for my family. My parents say, you are an athlete, you are not a housemaid. This is a break from your sports life. Perera has always wanted to win a medal on the world stage, representing her country and her people. I want to be the one girl from Sri Lanka who wins an international medal for the pole vault, she said. Being a housemaid is my job. But my work is not me  Im a gymnast and athlete. Undefeated since 2018 Pereras situation drew attention after a Sri Lankan television channel profiled her, causing outrage with people criticising the authorities for not doing enough to retain sporting talent. Soon after, The National spoke to Alexi Gunasekera, Sri Lankas consul general in Dubai, who said efforts were being made to find her a sports-related job in the emirate. He accompanied Perera to a meeting with sports authorities in Dubai on Wednesday to explore options so she could focus on training. The details are being worked out, he said. Perera is undefeated since 2018, with a pole vault national record of 3.71 metres set last year. According to World Athletics, the regional record so far stands at 4.72 metres, set by Li Ling from China in 2019. As a teenager, gymnastics was Pereras first love and she represented her country in international events including the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow. The rigour of gymnastics practice helped her make the shift to the pole vault in 2017 when after joining the military she represented Sri Lankas army in competitions. This opened up the chance to train in army facilities equipped for the pole vault and she began breaking records soon after. However, when her mother suffered a stroke that left her partially paralysed, Perera was forced to hit pause on her vaulting dreams. Im nothing without my parents and when my mummy is on the bed how can I not take care of my family, she said. I decided to find a job in Dubai so I can pay for her treatment. Perera sends most of her monthly salary home to pay for care for her mother, who now can walk a few steps with help. Compelled to leave home Sri Lankas economic collapse last year sent fuel, food and electricity prices soaring as the currency plummeted and the nation defaulted on external debt for the first time since independence in 1948. This prompted more than 311,000 people to leave in search of jobs, mainly to Gulf nations, as per government employment bureau numbers last year. Similar numbers are expected to leave to find work abroad this year. Perera also wants to address critics on social media who deride her for taking a maids job and giving a negative portrayal of Sri Lanka. It is my private life that I came to Dubai and I work as a housemaid, she said. When I left, no one cared for my athletic life so I had to leave to take care of my family. Now they say why go as a housemaid and that I should come back. People ask why I make sad news about Sri Lanka, but Im speaking to say Im taking care of my mummy and my family. Perera says she also wants to speak up for her friends and other athletes who have won medals for Sri Lanka and also struggle to make ends meet. People should know about them. Mine is only one story. We have many stories in Sri Lanka, they need help, she said. Despite her brave front, it has not been easy to step off the track. I miss my competition, my dreams, my future, she said. Its very hard. Sometimes I cry with my coach, with my father. I do want to start my sports again. Support for training The Sri Lankan government has taken note of her story, meaning there may be a happy ending for Perera. When we got the news that a Sri Lankan national record holder has come to the UAE and is working as a housemaid, as consular officials we had to act, said Mr Gunasekera. We are trying to see what can be done with the support of Dubai sport authorities. She needs time to train and she needs an employment opportunity to earn because she has to look after her mother. Mr Gunasekera said in popular sports such as cricket, Sri Lankan sportsmen earned enough to handle their familys medical expenses but other athletes may not be able to cover charges. Sachini has the talent and is determined. Im positive there are clubs in the UAE or schools she can work in to achieve her dream, Mr Gunasekera said. Despite yearning to follow her passion, Perera said she is grateful to her current employers who give her time off to use the gym, pool facilities and take her to the beach and Safa Park to train every week. They treat me very well, she said. I have gone past a bad situation because of them. Source  The National -Agencies",
