        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe has instructed all relevant departments to expedite the drafting of legislation necessary for the implementation of the Action Plan for the countrys reconciliation. Speaking at a discussion held in this regard at the Presidential Secretariat on Thursday afternoon (08 June), Wickremeisnghe emphasised the need for enhanced operations of the Office of Missing Persons, including digitisation efforts and the issuance of Certificates of Absence for individuals who had previously disappeared without trace. The progress of initiatives within five key areas -legislation, institutional activities, land issues, prisoner release, and power decentralization, was also reviewed. The discussion encompassed several important topics. The implementation of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC), the establishment of a National Land Council, and the formulation of a National Land Policy were among the matters addressed. Furthermore, President Wickremesinghe instructed the relevant parties to complete the ongoing initiatives to establish the Office of Reparations and the Office for National Unity and Reconciliation within the next two to three months. A comprehensive report on the progress of these programs was also requested. Regarding land-related issues, particular attention was given to resolving problems associated with displaced persons resettlement, releasing privately held lands for public use, and addressing Mahaweli lands concerns. The President emphasized the urgency of taking immediate action to settle these land-related issues and tasked the officials with devising effective mechanisms for their resolution. To address the release of prisoners and amnesty matters, the President instructed the relevant officials to submit a detailed report through the Ministry of Justice. The discussion also covered topics such as power decentralization, provincial-level development plans, and the appointment of a Provincial Ombudsman. These matters were thoroughly deliberated upon to ensure effective governance and progress at the provincial level. Several key individuals participated in the discussion, including Minister of Foreign Affairs Ali Sabri, Presidents Senior Adviser on National Security and Chief of Presidential Staff Sagala Ratnayaka, Presidents Secretary Saman Ekanayake, Prime Ministers Secretary Anura Dissanayake, Defence Ministry Secretary General Kamal Gunaratne (Rtd), Attorney General Sanjay Rajaratnam, and other heads of relevant line agencies.

        "title": "Donald Trump indictment: Seven charges over classified documents case",
        "date": "June 9, 2023 10:06 pm",
        "content": "Former US President Donald Trump has been charged over his handling of classified documents after he left the White House. Mr Trump, 76, faces seven counts, including mishandling classified documents and obstructing efforts to investigate the storage of the files at his Florida home, his lawyer said. Both are federal crimes which can carry a prison sentence on conviction. Mr Trump is campaigning to make a return to the White House in 2024. Legal experts say the indictment does not prevent him running for the presidency again. It is the second time Mr Trump has been charged with a crime, but now he is facing a federal case. These typically carry harsher sentences. He is the first former president ever to be criminally prosecuted by the government he once headed. In a post on Truth Social on Thursday, Mr Trump said he had been summoned to appear on Tuesday afternoon at a federal court in Miami, Florida, where the charges against him will be read. I never thought it possible that such a thing could happen to a former president of the United States, Mr Trump wrote. He added: This is indeed a dark day for the United States of America. We are a country in serious and rapid decline, but together we will Make America Great Again! The charges have not yet been made public, but the details were laid out by his lawyer Jim Trusty. He told CNN they include conspiracy, false statements, obstruction of justice, and illegally retaining classified documents under the Espionage Act. Mr Trump was at his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey, on Thursday when news of the indictment broke. On Friday, the US Secret Service will meet Mr Trumps staff and security officers to plan his journey to the Miami court next week. Prosecutors had also presented evidence in court in Washington DC, but a decision to file the indictment in southern Florida instead may offer some consolation for the Trump team. Legal experts say the state - where the former Republican president is popular - is likely to produce a less Democratic-leaning jury pool than if the case had been prosecuted in the US capital. The investigation into Mr Trumps handling of classified documents has been overseen by special prosecutor Jack Smith, who was appointed by Attorney General Merrick Garland in November. Mr Smith, a former war crimes investigator, is also overseeing a separate probe into Mr Trumps role in the storming of the US Capitol. In the documents case, prosecutors have said that Mr Trump took about 300 classified files to his Florida estate, Mar-a-Lago, after leaving the White House. About 100 of those - some labelled top secret - were seized when the FBI searched the Palm Beach mansion last August. Reports surfaced last week that prosecutors had obtained an audio recording of Mr Trump acknowledging he kept a classified document after leaving the White House in January 2021. Transcripts of that tape circulated in US media on Friday. It is against US law for federal officials - including a president - to remove or keep classified documents at an unauthorised location. Legal experts say Mr Trump will still be able to enter the White House race. He can be indicted any number of times and it wont stop his ability to stand for office, says David Super, a professor at Georgetown University Law Centre. Opinion polls show Mr Trump is currently the frontrunner for the Republican presidential nomination. He could continue running even if convicted in the documents case. As Mr Trump issued a fundraising email with the subject line BREAKING: INDICTED on Thursday, several leading Republicans voiced their support for him. Speaker of the House of Representatives, Kevin McCarthy, said it was unconscionable for a president to indict the leading candidate opposing him. House Republicans will hold this brazen weaponisation of power accountable, he wrote on Twitter. Mr Trumps rival for the 2024 nomination, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, said: We have for years witnessed an uneven application of the law depending upon political affiliation. The DeSantis administration will bring accountability to the DOJ, excise political bias and end weaponisation once and for all. Mr Trump became the first former president to be charged with a crime in April, after he pleaded not guilty to 34 counts of falsifying business records over a hush-money payment to a porn star. He faces a trial in that case in New York next year. Adding to his legal jeopardy, a prosecutor in Georgia is expected to announce this summer whether Mr Trump will be charged over alleged efforts to overturn the outcome of the 2020 presidential election in that state.

        "date": "June 10, 2023 10:23 am",
        "content": "Former British Prime Minister Boris Johnson abruptly quit as a member of parliament on Friday in a furious protest against lawmakers investigating his behaviour, reopening deep divisions in the ruling Conservative Party ahead of a general election expected next year. Johnson had been under investigation by a parliamentary inquiry looking into whether he misled the House of Commons about lockdown-breaking parties in Downing Street during the COVID-19 pandemic. After Johnson received a confidential letter from the committee, he accused lawmakers investigating him of acting like a kangaroo court and being determined to end his political career. Accusing the committee of mounting a political hit job, Johnson said in a statement: I am being forced out by a tiny handful of people, with no evidence to back up their assertions. Parliaments privileges committee - the main disciplinary body for lawmakers - had the power to recommend Johnson be suspended from parliament. If the suspension is for more than 10 days, voters in his constituency could have demanded he stood for re-election to continue as their representative. Johnson hinted that he could return to politics, declaring he was leaving parliament for now. But the decision to resign may be the end of his 22-year political career, where he rose from parliament to mayor of London and then built a profile that tipped the balance of the 2016 European Union referendum in favour of Brexit. Johnson, whose premiership was cut short in part by anger in his own party and across Britain over COVID rule-breaking lockdown parties in his Downing Street office and residence, said the committee had not found a shred of evidence against him. I am not alone in thinking that a witch hunt is underway to take revenge for Brexit and ultimately to reverse the 2016 referendum result, he said. My removal is the necessary first step, and I believe there has been a concerted attempt to bring it about. The investigation is chaired by a senior Labour Party lawmaker, but the majority of lawmakers on the committee are Conservatives. The committee said it will meet on Monday to conclude its inquiry and will publish its report soon. A spokesperson for the committee said Johnson had impugned the integrity of parliament with his resignation statement. ATTACK ON SUNAK The resignation will trigger a by-election for his constituency in west London. It is the second in a day for Prime Minister Rishi Sunak after an ally of Johnson, Nadine Dorries, announced she would step down. Angela Rayner, deputy leader of the Labour Party, said: The British public are sick to the back teeth of this never-ending Tory soap opera played out at their expense. Johnson came to power nearly four years ago, promising to deliver Brexit and rescue it from the bitter wrangling that followed the 2016 referendum. He shrugged off concerns from some fellow Conservatives that his narcissism, failure to deal with details, and a reputation for deceit meant he was unsuitable. Some Conservatives enthusiastically backed the former journalist, while others, despite reservations, supported him because he was able to appeal to parts of the electorate that usually rejected their party. That was borne out in the December 2019 election. But his administrations combative and often chaotic approach to governing and the scandals exhausted the goodwill of many of his lawmakers. Opinion polls show he is no longer popular with the public at large. Johnson used his resignation statement on Friday to deliver an attack on the premiership of Sunak, whom he partly blames for ending his government. The men, who worked closely together during the pandemic, have had a feud since Sunak resigned as finance minister last summer in protest against Johnsons leadership. When I left office last year the government was only a handful of points behind in the polls. That gap has now massively widened, he said. Our party needs urgently to recapture its sense of momentum and its belief in what this country can do. Source: Reuters -Agencies",

        "date": "June 10, 2023 02:41 pm",
        "content": "Four children have been found alive after surviving a plane crash and spending weeks fending for themselves in Colombias Amazon jungle. Colombias president said the rescue of the siblings, aged 13, nine, four and one, was a joy for the whole country. The childrens mother and two pilots were killed when their light aircraft crashed in the jungle on 1 May. The missing group became the focus of a huge rescue operation involving dozens of soldiers and local people. President Gustavo Petro said finding the children was a magical day, adding: They were alone, they themselves achieved an example of total survival which will remain in history. These children are today the children of peace and the children of Colombia. Mr Petro shared a photograph of several members of the military and Indigenous community tending to the siblings, who had been missing for 40 days. He said the children were receiving medical attention - and that he had spoken to their grandfather, who told him the mother jungle returned them. The children have been flown to the nations capital Bogota, where ambulances took them to hospital for further medical treatment. The Cessna 206 aircraft the children and their mother had been travelling on before the crash was flying from Araracuara, in Amazonas province, to San José del Guaviare, when it issued a mayday alert due to engine failure. The bodies of the three adults were found at the crash site by the army, but it appeared that the children had escaped the wreckage and wandered into the rainforest to find help. A massive search began and in May, rescuers recovered items left behind by the children, including a childs drinking bottle, a pair of scissors, a hair tie and a makeshift shelter. Small footprints were also discovered, which led search teams to believe the children were still alive in the rainforest, which is home to jaguars, snakes and other predators. The children belong to the Huitoto indigenous group and members of their community hoped that their knowledge of fruits and jungle survival skills would give them a better chance of remaining alive. Indigenous people joined the search and helicopters broadcast a message from the childrens grandmother, recorded in the Huitoto language, urging them to stop moving to make them easier to locate. Colombias president came under criticism last month when a tweet published on his account mistakenly announced that the children had been found. He erased the tweet the next day saying that the information - which his office had been given by Colombias child welfare agency - could not be confirmed. Source: BBC -Agencies",

According to the police, the suspect is a grass cutter who had been in the vicinity of the construction site where the 5-year-olds body was found. The child, who had suffered cut wounds initially believed to have been caused by the pieces of a broken glass bottle, was found dead on Thursday evening at a construction site in the Mulleriyawa police division. It was observed that the five-year-old, named Jonathan Mark Fonseka had died of excessive bleeding. Meanwhile, pieces of a broken glass bottle too were found approximately 4 feet away from the body. But this had raised suspicions as the investigators could not find any blood stains between the body and the shards. Later, in a shocking revelation made during his confession, the suspect had admitted that the boy had not, in fact, died from cut wounds caused by the shards of a broken glass bottle as initially suspected. In his confession, the 51-year-old grass cutter admitted that the child had died after the blades of his lawnmower had struck the boy accidentally. Grappled with panic at the time, the suspect had then placed the shards of a broken glass bottle near the body, making it appear as the apparent cause of the critical injuries suffered by the child. The police earlier said the child had been looked after by his grandparents during the daytime, while his mother, who is separated from her husband, was away at work. The body of the child was handed over to the parents following the completion of the post-mortem examination at the Infectious Disease Hospital (IDH) in Mulleriyawa.",

        "date": "June 10, 2023 05:44 pm",
        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe says the government aims to maximize the contribution of tourism in order to achieve the development goals of the country. Sri Lankas unique culinary art has attracted tourists from all over the world and maximum government support will be extended to its promotion, the Head of State said further, addressing the Culinary Art Food Expo (CAFE) 2023 on Friday. The event was held at the Bandaranaike Memorial International Conference Hall (BMICH) in Colombo. The Culinary Art and Food Exhibition, which showcases the talent of culinary artists from all over Sri Lanka, is organized by the Chefs Guild of Lanka. This years exhibition consists of 88 product and service booths and the President also joined in observing the booths. The President also engaged in a cordial conversation with the chefs who participated in the exhibition, also inquired about the issues they were facing. Wickremesinghe also vowed to implement many new programs for the advancement of the field, including the establishment of a Culinary Art school and the introduction of a system for ranking chefs. President Ranil Wickremesinghes address is as follows: First of all, I must thank you for inviting me to this exhibition. And what you have displayed here fits in with the growth policy of the Government. The growth policy of the Government includes tourism to double and in first stage the numbers to go up to 5 million. Secondly, increase their revenue per tourist, which means we have to now go to the high end tourists. Some are worried whether it is a difficult jump to make. I dont think you have any option. We have a large number of human resources leaving the country because it is far more attractive elsewhere. We have at least got to match Maldives in the remuneration. Otherwise you cant run a tourist industry. That can only be done if we are prepared to increase the rate thereby. But to do that we must give a good service. There are many aspects; But remember, one that is common to all is cuisine. The tourists are coming here because they are interested in cuisine. As far as the suppliers are concerned, we would like you to remain in a high standard and even go have a higher standard, be able to make a mark that somehow you can even export some of your products to other countries. We have to ensure that we have a sufficient number of tests in this country as the industry expands. Unfortunately, at the moment we havent. We have no means of satisfying the demand. So the Government will certainly help different hotels and associations to expand the number. Dont expect the Government to do it. We dont. We cant cater to that market that is required. So that has to be done by the non-Government sector and we are certainly willing to help. We will also help by starting one school, specifically for cuisine and culinary work. So thats what we can do. I hope that the others will take up. There has been a demand in the South. I think we can have one in Nuwara Eliya, Bandarawela, Ella and Dambulla. We can help ensure you to get chefs from abroad who also have the experience to ensure that their knowledge and the experience is passed onto the younger members of this profession. Secondly, I think we should have some system of grading our chefs. So why dont we have international standards and give a few stars? I think when the new tourist policy is announced it is a matter that you will have to discuss with the Ministry of Tourism. I would like to see some of the private entrepreneurs coming forward. You cant develop the tourist industry without developing the human resources. It is useless giving tax incentives for hotels if they havent got the manpower for the kitchens. So the Government is willing to help and to work together with, most probably in the next two months, announce our new policies and you will be surprised at what changes we are going to make. And similarly your association and others involved in the tourist trade will get together I presume, to help us go forward. Remember, we have a good future and we do so by developing the young talent we have. All those people here should one day become good chefs and I hope work in Sri Lanka. But we have to ensure the conditions here are conducive to them for staying in the country.",

The doctor stressed that the internationally accepted Breteau Index  which is used for estimating the density of infectious mosquitoes in an area  is five times higher than the usual value calculated in certain areas of the Colombo District. He mentioned that although the index value should prevail at 5, it is reported to be 25 in certain areas. Thus, there is a risk of dengue infections exacerbating into a severe epidemic situation by the end of June in the Colombo district, the doctor emphasized.

He was ordered free by the Supreme Court on November 11, 2022, yet is lodged at the special camp located on the Trichy Central Prison campus, along with Murugan, Robert Payas and Jayakumar. In a letter, Suthenthiraraja talks about his life inside the special camp where even sunlight doesnt touch their body. Through his note, he requests Tamilians across the world to lend their voices in support of him so that he can return to his home country. Santhan stated that despite writing letters to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Home Minister Amit Shah and the External Affairs Minister to send him back to Sri Lanka or give him access to the Sri Lankan Deputy High Commission office in Chennai to renew his identity proof, he received no response from them. I have been lodged in the special camp inside the Trichy central prison campus for the last six months. Over 120 foreigners live in the special camp and around 90 of them are from Sri Lanka, the letter read. He further said that there is no differentiation between Tamilians, Sinhalese or Muslims at the special camp. Four of us, who have been freed by the SC in connection with the Rajiv Gandhi case, are kept in rooms where the windows are closed by a tin sheet, he writes in his letter. He further wrote, While Robert Payas and Jayakumar are in one room, Murugan and I share another room. But these rooms are not close to each other. We cant talk or interact with each other. Santhan said that he is not even allowed to speak over the phone. Only blood relatives can meet the inmates. He further questioned in his letter, For a foreigner like me, how can I have a blood relative here in India? He said that the government gave them Rs 175 per day. For 32 years I have not seen my mother. I couldnt be with my father in his last years and it has been troubling me. If my desire to be with my mom during her last days is wrong, then no one needs to support me, he wrote in the letter. Source  India Today -Agencies",

        "date": "June 11, 2023 10:57 am",
        "content": "Theodore Ted Kaczynski, the Harvard-educated mathematician who retreated to a dingy shack in the Montana wilderness and ran a 17-year bombing campaign that killed three people and injured 23 others, died Saturday. He was 81. Branded the Unabomber by the FBI, Kaczynski died at the federal prison medical center in Butner, North Carolina, Kristie Breshears, a spokesperson for the federal Bureau of Prisons, told The Associated Press. He was found unresponsive in his cell early Saturday morning and was pronounced dead around 8 a.m., she said. The cause of death was not immediately known. Before his transfer to the prison medical facility, he had been held in the federal Supermax prison in Florence, Colorado, since May 1998, when he was sentenced to four life sentences plus 30 years for a campaign of terror that set universities nationwide on edge. He admitted to committing 16 bombings between 1978 and 1995, permanently maiming several of his victims. Years before the Sept. 11 attacks and the anthrax mailing, the Unabombers deadly homemade bombs changed the way Americans mailed packages and boarded airplanes, even virtually shutting down air travel on the West Coast in July 1995. He forced The Washington Post, in conjunction with The New York Times, to make the agonizing decision in September 1995 to publish his 35,000-word manifesto, Industrial Society and Its Future, which claimed modern society and technology was leading to a sense of powerlessness and alienation. But it led to his undoing. Kaczynskis brother, David, and Davids wife, Linda Patrik, recognized the treatises tone and tipped off the FBI, which had been searching for the Unabomber for years in the nations longest, costliest manhunt. Authorities in April 1996 found him in a 10-by-14-foot (3-by-4-meter) plywood and tarpaper cabin outside Lincoln, Montana, that was filled with journals, a coded diary, explosive ingredients and two completed bombs. As an elusive criminal mastermind, the Unabomber won his share of sympathizers and comparisons to Daniel Boone, Edward Abbey and Henry David Thoreau. But once revealed as a wild-eyed hermit with long hair and a beard who weathered Montana winters in a one-room shack, Kaczynski struck many as more of a pathetic loner than a romantic anti-hero. Even in his own journals, Kaczynski came across not as a committed revolutionary but as a vengeful hermit driven by petty grievances. I certainly dont claim to be an altruist or to be acting for the good (whatever that is) of the human race, he wrote on April 6, 1971. I act merely from a desire for revenge. A psychiatrist who interviewed Kaczynski in prison diagnosed him as a paranoid schizophrenic. Mr. Kaczynskis delusions are mostly persecutory in nature, Sally Johnson wrote in a 47-page report. The central themes involve his belief that he is being maligned and harassed by family members and modern society. Kaczynski hated the idea of being viewed as mentally ill and when his lawyers attempted to present an insanity defense, he tried to fire them. When that failed, he tried to hang himself with his underwear. Kaczynski eventually pleaded guilty rather than let his defense team proceed with an insanity defense. Im confident that Im sane, Kaczynski told Time magazine in 1999. I dont get delusions and so forth. He was certainly brilliant. Kaczynski skipped two grades to attend Harvard at age 16 and had published papers in prestigious mathematics journals. His explosives were carefully tested and came in meticulously handcrafted wooden boxes sanded to remove possible fingerprints. Later bombs bore the signature FC for Freedom Club. The FBI called him the Unabomber because his early targets seemed to be universities and airlines. An altitude-triggered bomb he mailed in 1979 went off as planned aboard an American Airlines flight; a dozen people aboard suffered from smoke inhalation. Kaczynski killed computer rental store owner Hugh Scrutton, advertising executive Thomas Mosser and timber industry lobbyist Gilbert Murray. California geneticist Charles Epstein and Yale University computer expert David Gelernter were maimed by bombs two days apart in June 1993. Mosser was killed in his North Caldwell, New Jersey, home on Dec. 10, 1994, a day he was supposed to be picking out a Christmas tree with his family. His wife, Susan, found him grievously wounded by a barrage of razor blades, pipes and nails. He was moaning very softly, she said at Kaczynskis 1998 sentencing. The fingers on his right hand were dangling. I held his left hand. I told him help was coming. I told him I loved him. When Kaczynski stepped up his bombs and letters to newspapers and scientists in 1995, experts speculated the Unabomber was jealous of the attention being paid to Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh. A threat to blow up a plane out of Los Angeles before the end of the July Fourth weekend threw air travel and mail delivery into chaos. The Unabomber later claimed it was a prank. The Washington Post printed the Unabombers manifesto at the urging of federal authorities, after the bomber said he would desist from terrorism if a national publication published his treatise. Patrik had had a disturbing feeling about her brother-in-law even before seeing the manifesto and eventually persuaded her husband to read a copy at the library. After two months of arguments, they took some of Ted Kaczynskis letters to Patriks childhood friend Susan Swanson, a private investigator in Chicago. Swanson in turn passed them along to former FBI behavioral science expert Clint Van Zandt, whose analysts said whoever wrote them had also probably written the Unabombers manifesto. It was a nightmare, David Kaczynski, who as a child had idolized his older brother, said in a 2005 speech at Bennington College. I was literally thinking, My brothers a serial killer, the most wanted man in America. Swanson turned to a corporate lawyer friend, Anthony Bisceglie, who contacted the FBI. The investigation and prosecution were overseen by now-Attorney General Merrick Garland, during a previous stint at the Justice Department. David Kaczynski wanted his role kept confidential, but his identity quickly leaked out and Ted Kaczynski vowed never to forgive his younger sibling. He ignored his letters, turned his back on him at court hearings and described David Kaczynski in a 1999 book draft as a Judas Iscariot (who) ... doesnt even have enough courage to go hang himself. Ted Kaczynski was born May 22, 1942, in Chicago, the son of second-generation Polish Catholics  a sausage-maker and a homemaker. He played the trombone in the school band, collected coins and skipped the sixth and 11th grades. His high school classmates thought him odd, particularly after he showed a school wrestler how to make a mini-bomb that detonated during chemistry class. Harvard classmates recalled him as a lonely, thin boy with poor personal hygiene and a room that smelled of spoiled milk, rotting food and foot powder. After graduate studies at the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor, he got a job teaching math at the University of California at Berkeley but found the work difficult and quit abruptly. In 1971, he bought a 1 12-acre parcel about 4 miles (6 kilometers) outside of Lincoln and built a cabin there without heating, plumbing or electricity. He learned to garden, hunt, make tools and sew, living on a few hundred dollars a year. He left his cabin in Montana in the late 1970s to work at a foam rubber products manufacturer outside Chicago with his father and brother. But when a female supervisor dumped him after two dates, he began posting insulting limericks about her and wouldnt stop. His brother fired him and Ted Kaczynski soon returned to the wilderness to continue plotting his vengeful killing spree. Source - The Associated Press -Agencies",

        "date": "June 11, 2023 03:17 pm",
        "content": "The grandfather of the 05-year-old boy whose body was found with cut injuries at a construction site in Mulleriyawa has been granted bail after being produced before the Alutkade No. 06 Magitrates Court today (June 11). Accordingly, he has been released on two surety bails of Rs. 300,000 each, and was also ordered to appear before the courts on June 15, 2023. Police last night (June 10) arrested the grandfather of the 05-year-old boy, who was recently found dead at a construction site in Mulleriyawa, over failure to provide necessary protection for the child. The child, who had suffered cut wounds initially believed to have been caused by the pieces of a broken glass bottle, was found dead on Thursday evening (June 08) at a construction site in the Mulleriyawa police division. The investigators observed that the five-year-old, Jonathan Mark Fonseka, had died due to excessive bleeding. Meanwhile, pieces of a broken glass bottle were also found approximately 4 feet away from the body. But this raised suspicions as the investigators could not find any blood stains between the body and the glass shards. Later, a grass cutter who had been in the vicinity of the child on that day was arrested in connection with the childs death. Making a startling revelation during the interrogations, the suspect admitted that the boy had not, in fact, died from cut wounds caused by the shards of a broken glass bottle as initially suspected. In his confession, the 51-year-old grass cutter confessed that the child had died after the blades of his grass-cutting machine had struck the boy accidentally. In a panic, the suspect went on to place the shards of a broken glass bottle near the body, to make it look like the apparent cause of the critical injuries suffered by the child were due to the broken glass bottle. The grass cutter was placed remanded until June 15, after being produced before the courts yesterday. It was reported that the child had been looked after by his grandparents during the daytime, while his mother, who is separated from her husband, was away at work. However, the grandfather, who went out to get some work done on the day of the incident, had left the child with the suspect who was working at the construction site where he served as a caretaker. Meanwhile, the body of the child was handed over to the parents following the completion of the post-mortem examination at the Infectious Disease Hospital (IDH) in Mulleriyawa. The final rites of the child are scheduled to be carried out today.",

The U.S. Geological Survey, which records earthquakes around the world, recorded a 5.0 magnitude earthquake at 2:38 a.m. local time. It said the epicenter was 6 kilometers (3.7 miles) from Alberton, a town on the southeastern outskirts of Johannesburg. There were no immediate reports of casualties or any significant damage. An earthquake of that strength is classified as minor but would be clearly felt and might cause small damage to buildings. An Associated Press journalist who lives close to the epicenter said the shaking felt like being on a moving train and lasted for about a minute. Many South Africans in Gauteng province, which includes Johannesburg, said on social media they awoke to find the walls of their homes shaking. Local media published videos showing the moment the quake struck. Earthquakes are rare in South Africa. The last one to measure 5.0 magnitude or higher was in 2014, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. That 5.4 magnitude quake had its epicenter near the gold mining town of Orkney in the North West province and one person was reported to have died. Source - The Associated Press -Agencies",

        "date": "June 11, 2023 06:49 pm",
        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe emphasized that the standards of Sri Lankan universities were high on the list of Asian universities, the Presidents Media Division reported. The standard and reputation of the universities should be restored and improved once again in the countrys university system to attract students overseas, he said, adding that this would also help to improve the development of the countrys economy. The president stressed that he is satisfied with the education received during his era compared to the present day. He said that for many of the people during his time, the United Kingdom was a second choice, if not the first, after the University of Ceylon. However, when asked by the young generation today about the satisfaction of todays education system, the answer would be negative. Even if they are selected for a university, they are trying to go abroad, he said. The President highlighted the need for fixing the issues with the educational system in this nation and added that conditions should be put in place so that everyone can complete their education at the appropriate age and move on. President Wickremesinghe stressed the importance of being attentive to the South Asian population. In 2050, India will have about another 3400 million, rising to 1.7 billion. The poverty level will decrease, while the better income number will increase. He anticipated that this change may occur in Bangladesh, Pakistan, Myanmar, and the East African nations. They alone cant be building universities. India will have nothing else to do if they are going to provide education for all of them, so they will either use other techniques. Therefore, Sri Lanka must be vigilant in these areas. If Sri Lanka has a sufficient number of universities, it would help to cater to some of them from those areas. These remarks were made by President Ranil Wickremesinghe while addressing the CVCD Excellence Awards held at the Bandaranaike Memorial International Conference Hall in Colombo on Friday (9). President Ranil Wickremesinghe attended the CVCD Excellence Awards ceremony as the Chief Guest and was welcomed by the Chairman of the Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Directors Sri Lanka (CVCD), Professor Sujeeva Amarasena, the Vice Chancellor of Ruhunu University. Prof. Nilanthi De Silva, Vice-Chancellor of the University of Kelaniya, introduced the award ceremony in detail. President Ranil Wickremesinghe was appreciated by the Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Directors (CVCD), Sri Lanka, for his excellent leadership and commitment in establishing an innovative research culture within the university system. Organized biennially by the Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Directors Sri Lanka (CVCD), the CVCD Excellence Awards recognize and honor outstanding contributions and achievements in research, innovation, and invention by scholars in the Sri Lankan university system. The awards are presented in three categories: Most Outstanding Senior Researcher, Most Outstanding Young Researcher, and Most Outstanding Inventor. In this years awards ceremony, the Most Outstanding Senior Researcher and Most Outstanding Young Researcher Awards for the year 2022, Allied Health Sciences and Indigenous Medicine, Engineering, Architecture, and Technology, Humanities, Life Sciences, Management Studies, Medicine, and Dentistry, were awarded for eight fields of study: natural sciences, social sciences, and legal studies. Accordingly, Prof. B. it. K. S. Perera (University of Moratuwa), Prof. D. M. Deepti Yakandawala (University of Peradeniya), Prof. Arosha Sarangi Adikaram (University of Colombo), Prof. Shaman Rajindrajith (University of Colombo), L. B. D. R. P. Wijesundara (University of Kelaniya), and Prof S. Mr. P. Karunanayake (Open University) received the Most Outstanding Senior Researcher Award. Dr. A. N. Madushanka (University of Peradeniya), Dr. K. K. Asanka Sanjeeva (Sri Jayawardenepura University), Dr. W. H. M. Sanjeeva Samaratunga (Rajarata University), Dr. M. B. Kavinda Chandimal Dayasiri (University of Kelaniya), and Prof. A. Mr. Sandaruwan Ratnayake (University of Uva Wellassa) received the Most Outstanding Young Researcher Award. University of Moratuwa Professor Rangika Umesh Halwathura won the Most Outstanding Inventor Award. Vavuniya University Vice Chancellor Professor T. Mangaleswaran delivered the speech of thanks, and members of the committee of Sri Lanka Vice Chancellors and Directors, family members of award-winning scholars, and others attended this event. Following is the full speech made by President Ranil Wickremesinghe: Seated here, I was thinking back to the time that I had finished A-levels and sat for the exam. My father also insisted that I take the London A-level, which was held in Madras. So, I flew to Madras and sat for the London A-Level. But at the same time, I received the results of the Sri Lankan, as you called it, Ceylon A-levels, and I found that I had gotten into the university and had been selected. It was a simple system then. In none of these marking systems, all those who got four subject passes went in first, followed by those who got three subjects. I also got my A-level results from London A-level. I applied through UCCA, and there was one university that was prepared to take me based on Sri Lankan A-level results. And others certainly considered me based on my London A-level results. So, I had to make a decision whether I was going to stay here or go to the UK. I really thought of staying in Sri Lanka. My mother was insisting I go to the University of Ceylon, Peradeniya, because of my grandfathers connections, but I had made up my mind. I felt that if I am to do law, it has to be in Colombo. Otherwise, I have to go on to another subject, like economics or history. So, I am telling you, I never studied economics. When I look back, I think that at that time, a lot of people told me this was a good degree. This is well accepted. The dean of that time, the professor of law, Professor Nadarajah, was the leading exponent of Roman Dutch law after Professor Lee died. We had a number of lecturers, the youngest, of course, being a young temporary assistant lecturer called G.L. Peiris. I passed out, and Im quite happy with my education here. But when I speak to young people today, I ask them, Would you like to stay in Sri Lanka? The answer to many of them is no. Even if selected by a university. For many of us in the UK, it was a second choice if you were not selected for the University of Ceylon. But it is not, so today, having spoken to them and listened to their views, I dont know what I would do if I came to making a selection today. So, this is a crisis in the university system. Its a part of the larger crisis in Sri Lanka itself and how we face the future. So we have to look at the university system and what the role of education is first, then look at the local issues. As I asked the chairman, we have about 170,000 qualifying for the A-levels; of that, 40,000 get into universities here, and another 30, 000 to 40,000 go to universities abroad. So thats the difference. Whats the difference? So that another 40,000, of which I would say 25000 to 30000, would be prepared to enter Sri Lankan universities. We dont have the resources, so thats the first one. Are we going to have a system of universities coming under the UGC and universities outside the UGC, some for profit and others not for profit? Three systems are functioning, or should we gradually look at building up one system of universities? So thats the first one. Secondly, the government makes money available to fund students higher education. But then we find that another group of students equal to the number in the universities is going outside and paying money. So, is this the best way we have? We must preserve one right, which is in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights: universal access to education. But different countries have different ways of doing it. Some give student loans; some help students who have economic issues but allow the others to go ahead. So, are we to study? I think we have to study all these systems and then ensure the government makes the funding available. Look at the best system available for the maximum number to get their education. Thats the first item I think we have to go into if we cant run away from the issue, because we will need a large number of engineers, a large number of doctors, and a large number of scientists. If we are to develop and go ahead, where are we going to get them? Who is going to educate them? Thats, I would say, the main issue we have. Secondly, one of the standards is: where are we now? When I went to university, our universities were high up on the list of Asian universities. I am not talking about the worlds list of Asian universities. We are not so today; lets be frank about it. How are you going to improve our performance? How are we going to ensure that these universities have a good reputation and standing? Then youll attract students from other parts of the world, making your funding that much easier. How do the state universities function with disruptions and vice chancellors getting assaulted? That cannot happen. I think at some point we have to face these issues and resolve them. Theres no other way to do it. We must ensure that everyone studies so they can get ahead. We have a big problem in the education system; people dont sit for A-levels until they are about 20, and youre about 24 when you pass out. I was 21 when I sat for my degree, 22 when I got the results, and we were not awarded degrees because they were from 1971, and 23 when I became an advocate of the Supreme Court. I dont think anyone I know now has touched that. That means the best part of your life You spend time at the university, then go to find a job. So these issues had to be resolved. Then you will find the non-UGC universities coming up, and then they get students because the job market is there. Now, this is a problem not only for the UGC universities here but also for many universities abroad. But we had to find our own solution and not wait to see what others were going to do with regard to the universities. Then comes the issue of remuneration. Your main issue has been the present taxation, but another one that has been raised in universities is how you would pay your academic staff. In Western universities, each one is judged to be worth something in the market, and given that, are we to do that? Or are we going to carry on with this same system? As far as the non-UGC universities are concerned, I have no doubt that they will decide what the pay should be for each individual. These are the issues that we have to face. And then the research that is being done: how are the peer reviews? What are the standards? There are allegations regarding some of the research items that have been made, and all that has to be cleared. I mentioned to the chairman and some of the VCs that we dont have sufficient postgraduate studies in this country. What are the postgraduate studies you have done? The single University of Ceylon changed the culture of Ceylon with two plays Maname and Sinhabaahu. With that came the change. They produced the University of Ceylon History in four volumes. Some are maybe out of date, nevertheless, look at all the rest of it that they produced at the University of Ceylon. Have we all together in any way equalled that? Im not asking about overtaking equalled that; thats a question mark. So, these are serious issues that we have to think about. If you dont tackle these issues, you are going to face serious problems with the university education provided by the UGC University. Outside of that, there is the question that every university has to face today. What is a university? How do you educate? You had social media; you had it online. You have AI, and you have chat GBT, which people use for exams and some for their postgraduate research. So, can these brick-and-mortar institutes suffice? Or are we to use the technology? This is another issue that we have to take up. So, my effort is to ensure that you are focused on this and come up with solutions. If you look at the population of South Asia in 2050, India will have about another 3400 million, maybe going up to 1.7 billion. And that poverty level will decrease, and better income numbers will increase. This will happen in Bangladesh, Pakistan, Myanmar, and the East African nations. Now all of them cant build universities. India will have nothing else to do if they are going to provide education for all of them, so they will either use other techniques. So, we have to be sure of that. But if we have a sufficient number of universities, we can cater to some of them from those areas. Now they are catering to our needs. But there may come a time when we have to cater to their needs. So, these are the issues we have to think of because the structure of the universities will no longer be the same. There was a big debate originally about the first university in Ceylon, whether it was to be residential or not. They took the Oxford and Cambridge Model, and thats the structure of Peradeniya University. But if you look at the newer universities, all the residents are no longer there. Now, the question is not whether they are going to be halls of residence. Will there be halls for lectures? So, we have to address these issues and find solutions because we have appointed a Cabinet Committee on Education, which is going into all the issues. So, I thought Id mention to you all: what are the questions that we will be posing to you? So, I dont want to take any more of your time, but I must congratulate all those who got the awards here. What you have done is to raise the reputation of Sri Lankan universities for research, and taking that into account, we will make more money available for research. But how are we going to do it? We havent determined yet. I thought I would put about a billion aside for a year. I dont know if you can use it for the other subjects as well. And by then, well have the Institute of History for History and Archaeology to carry on. So, thank you again for inviting me, and all the best to the award winners. --PMD--",

The very severe cyclonic storm BIPARJOY over the East-Central Arabian Sea has intensified into an extremely severe cyclonic storm, the Met. Department warned. The cyclonic storm, which was located near latitude 18.2N and longitude 67.7E at 11.30 a.m. on June 11, would move nearly northwards during the next 24 hours, the advisory said. Accordingly, wind speeds will be 155-165 kmph and can increase up to 170-180 kmph in sea areas bounded by (13N - 23N) and (62E  70E) during the next 24 hours due to this system, the department warned. Meanwhile, heavy showers or thundershowers, high and at times very high seas can also be expected in above-sea areas, according to the Met. Department. The Department of Meteorology also advised naval and fishing communities not to venture into the sea areas bounded by (13N - 23N) and between (62E  70E) until further notice, owing to the aforementioned conditions. Those who are out in the aforementioned sea regions are advised to return to coasts or moved to safer areas immediately, while the fishing and naval community are requested to be attentive to future forecasts issued by the Department of Meteorology in this regard.",

        "date": "June 11, 2023 08:42 pm",
        "content": "Former Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon was arrested on Sunday in connection with a Police Scotland investigation into the Scottish National Partys funding, her spokesperson said. The police investigation is looking at what happened to more than 600,000 pounds (750,000) raised by Scottish independence campaigners in 2017, which was supposed to have been ring-fenced but may have been used for other purposes. Nicola Sturgeon has today, Sunday 11th June, by arrangement with Police Scotland, attended an interview where she was to be arrested and questioned, a spokesperson for Sturgeon said. Nicola has consistently said she would co-operate with the investigation if asked and continues to do so. Earlier, Police Scotland said on Twitter a 52-year-old woman had been arrested as a suspect in connection with the ongoing investigation into the funding and finances of the SNP. The woman is in custody and is being questioned by Police Scotland detectives, Police Scotland said. As the investigation is ongoing we are unable to comment further. The arrest of Sturgeon, who stepped down earlier this year, is deeply embarrassing for the SNP, which campaigns to end Scotlands three century political union with England. These issues are subject to a live police investigation. The SNP have been cooperating fully with this investigation and will continue to do so however it is not appropriate to publicly address any issues while that investigation is ongoing, an SNP spokesperson said. In April, Sturgeons husband, Peter Murrell and the partys then treasurer were both arrested and then released without charge pending further investigation as part of the same inquiry. A the time of Murrells arrest, police carried out a lengthy search of the couples home in Glasgow, which was sealed off with blue and white police tape. Sturgeon, Scotlands longest serving leader of its semi-autonomous government, caught the political world by surprise when she announced her resignation in February, saying she had become too divisive to lead her country to independence.

        "date": "June 12, 2023 04:25 pm",
        "content": "Nio said on Monday it would lower prices for all its models and end free battery swapping services to new buyers, as the Chinese electric vehicle maker faces mounting pressure over earnings losses and lukewarm sales. Nio will cut prices by 30,000 yuan (4,200) for all models including its revamped ES6 and ES8 sports utility vehicles from June 12, according to a company statement. That equates to discounts ranging from 6 to 9 on Nio cars. The company also would no longer provide free battery swapping services to buyers who place deposits on Monday and onwards, it said. More than 40 auto brands operating in China including BYD and Volkswagen have joined a price war started by Tesla this year in a fight for market share as car demand slumps, with ripples spreading throughout the countrys wider automotive industry. The adjustments had been discussed internally for quite a while and we took advice and suggestions from some users, Nio Chief Executive William Li said on the companys social media app, referring to the price cuts and the new policy on battery swapping. It is the best timing to publish it ... but we cant make everyone happy, he said. Nio had been offering the swapping services for free at least four times each month to existing owners. It is among only a handful of EV makers betting on battery swapping as a major power option for electric cars while main rival Tesla has dismissed battery swapping as riddled with problems and not suitable for widescale use. Nio said in February it would accelerate expansion of its batter swapping network with a plan to build 1,000 swapping stations in China this year to bring the total number of such sites to 2,300 by year-end. The loss-making companys investments in battery swapping stations, however, have been questioned by investors for dragging on its profitability. Its net loss reached 4.7 billion yuan in the first quarter, compared to 1.8 billion yuan in the same period a year earlier. Sales of Nio slid in April and May as the price war in China intensified and overall demand weakened. With its pure electric cars priced above 300,000 yuan, Nio delivered 43,854 vehicles in the first five months. In comparison, Teslas China sales were more than five times Nios over the same period, while BYD sold 923,343 cars, thanks to its offerings of both pure electric and plug-in hybrids for less than 300,000 yuan. Shares of Nio in Hong Kong rose nearly 5 on Monday. The shares have slumped nearly 20 so far this year. Source  Reuters -Agencies",

U.S. officials say the decision to return was motivated by concern that China is filling the gap left by the U.S. in UNESCO policymaking, notably in setting standards for artificial intelligence and technology education around the world. The U.S. and Israel stopped funding UNESCO after it voted to include Palestine as a member state in 2011, and the Trump administration decided in 2017 to withdraw from the agency altogether the following year, citing long-running anti-Israel bias and management problems. U.S. Deputy Secretary of State for Management and Resources Richard Verma submitted a letter last week to UNESCO Director General Audrey Azoulay formalizing the plan to rejoin. Verma noted progress in depoliticizing debate about the Middle East at UNESCO and reforming the agencys management, according to the hand-delivered letter, obtained by AP. Applause rang out in the solemn UNESCO auditorium as Azoulay announced the plan to ambassadors at a special meeting Monday, and delegate after delegate stood up to welcome the news. The return of the U.S., once the agencys biggest funder, is expected to face a vote by its 193 member states next month, according to a UNESCO diplomat. The decision is a big financial boost to the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, known for its World Heritage program as well as projects to fight climate change and teach girls to read. Chinas ambassador to UNESCO, Jin Yang, said his country appreciates UNESCOs efforts to bring the U.S. back, saying its absence had a negative impact on the agencys work. Being a member of an international organization is a serious issue, and we hope that the return of the U.S. this time means it acknowledges the mission and the goals of the organization, the ambassador said. Since her election in 2017, Azoulay has worked to address the reasons the U.S. left, through budget reforms and building consensus among Jordanian, Palestinian and Israeli diplomats around sensitive UNESCO resolutions. Azoulay  who is Jewish  won broad praise by UNESCO ambassadors for her personal efforts to address U.S. concerns around Israel in particular. The U.S. decision to come back is the result of five years of work, during which we calmed tensions, notably on the Middle East, improved our response to contemporary challenges, resumed major initiatives on the ground and modernized the functioning of the organization, Azoulay told The Associated Press. She met with Democrats and Republicans in Washington to explain those efforts, according to a UNESCO diplomat. Thanks to those bipartisan negotiations, UNESCO diplomats expressed confidence that the U.S. decision to return is for the long term, regardless of who wins next years presidential election. The diplomats were not authorized to be publicly named discussing the behind-the-scenes work that led to the U.S. decision. Under the plan, the U.S. government would pay its 2023 dues plus 10 million in bonus contributions this year earmarked for Holocaust education, preserving cultural heritage in Ukraine, journalist safety, and science and technology education in Africa, Vermas letter says. The Biden administration has already requested 150 million for the 2024 budget to go toward UNESCO dues and arrears. The plan foresees similar requests for the ensuing years until the full debt of 619 million is paid off. That makes up a big chunk of UNESCOs 534 million annual operating budget. Before leaving, the U.S. contributed 22 of the agencys overall funding. Undersecretary of State for Management John Bass said in March that the U.S. absence from UNESCO has strengthened China, and undercuts our ability to be as effective in promoting our vision of a free world. He said UNESCO is key in setting and shaping standards for technology and science teaching around the world, so if were really serious about the digital-age competition with China  we cant afford to be absent any longer. The U.S. absence plunged the agency into financial uncertainty. UNESCO diplomats described belt-squeezing across agency programs and aggressive efforts by Azoulay to boost voluntary financing from other countries to fill gaps. One diplomat expressed hope that the return of the U.S. would bring more ambition, and more serenity  and energize programs to regulate artificial intelligence, educate girls in Afghanistan and chronicle victims of slavery in the Caribbean. The diplomat said that the agency would also welcome Israel back if it wanted to rejoin. There was no immediate response from the Israeli government. Israel has long accused the United Nations of anti-Israel bias. In 2012, over Israeli objections, the state of Palestine was recognized as a nonmember observer state by the U.N. General Assembly. The Palestinians claim the West Bank, east Jerusalem and Gaza Strip  territories captured by Israel in the 1967 Mideast war  for an independent state. Israel says the Palestinians efforts to win recognition at the U.N. are aimed at circumventing a negotiated settlement and meant to pressure Israel into concessions. The United States previously pulled out of UNESCO under the Reagan administration in 1984 because it viewed the agency as mismanaged, corrupt and used to advance Soviet interests. It rejoined in 2003. Source: AP --Agencies",

        "title": "17 of Sri Lankas population in moderate acute food insecurity  report",
        "date": "June 12, 2023 10:20 pm",
        "content": "Food security in Sri Lanka is improving across all provinces, according to the Crop and Food Security Assessment Mission (CFSAM) report jointly carried out in FebruaryMarch 2023 by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP). The report estimates 3.9 million people or 17 percent of the population is in moderate acute food insecurity which is nearly a 40 percent decrease from JuneJuly last year. Nearly 10,000 people are severely acute food-insecure, down from 66,000 people last year. The improvement in food security stems from better food consumption, which could be attributed to reduced food prices and improved incomes among farming communities during the harvesting period when the mission was carried out. Despite this positive trend, food insecurity remains high in certain districts, especially Kilinochchi, Nuwara Eliya, Mannar, Batticaloa, Vavuniya, and Jaffna. The highest level of acute food insecurity was found within the tea plantation communities in the Estate sector and among daily wage labourers and households who rely on social assistance programmes, such as Samurdhi, as their main source of income. Production of cereal, including rice and maize, across the two main cropping seasons in 202223 is forecast at 4.1 million tonnes, 14 percent below the past five-year average, mainly due to poor plant nutrition caused by an inadequate supply of fertilizer and unaffordability of essential material inputs. However, essential fertilizers distributed to smallholder farmers by the Government, facilitated by funds received from multilateral and bilateral donor agencies, has significantly impacted production, marking an improvement in the yield with productivity in the recently harvested 202223 Maha season, 12 higher than the 2022 Yala season. Representative of FAO to Sri Lanka and the Maldives, Mr. Vimlendra Sharan speaking on CFSAM Report findings said, The Crop and Food Security Assessment Mission (CFSAM) report is an eye-opener on the continuing vulnerabilities and challenges that exist within the food systems of Sri Lanka. This report and its findings will no doubt serve as a guiding light for policymakers and stakeholders to collectively work towards ensuring food security, strengthening agricultural resilience and mitigating risks faced by farmers and rural communities who have been disproportionately impacted by the economic crisis. FAO remains committed to supporting Sri Lanka in their efforts towards achieving sustainable food systems, food security and zero hunger. After many months of challenges, we are finally witnessing an improvement to the countrys food security, said Abdur Rahim Siddiqui, WFP Sri Lankas Representative and Country Director. But there is more to be done. A high number of households -- more than 60 percent -- are adopting negative measures to put food on the table, including borrowing money and purchasing food on credit. WFP will extend its emergency operation, which commenced last year, to provide food rations and cash assistance to people identified as food insecure. Mission recommendations The joint FAOWFP Mission recommends providing immediate support to farmers, particularly by releasing available fertilizer stocks to enhance production and productivity in the ongoing Yala season and make urgent policy decisions to import fertilizers in time for the 202324 Maha cultivation season. The report also recommends any move for reducing or removing fertiliser subsidy to be in a gradual and phased manner, giving adequate time to the farming community to adapt. Other recommendations include the establishment of a Fertilizer Task Force to streamline fertilizer procurement and distributions as well as to strengthen adaptive research on climate smart agriculture and sustainable farming practices to improve fertiliser use efficiency. Further, to minimize the impact on the livestock and fisheries sectors, the mission recommends providing adequate support to increase fodder and feed crop production. Further recommendations include continuing food andor cash assistance to facilitate access to food among households most vulnerable to food insecurity. In the long-term, increased livelihood support to food-insecure households and resilience-building initiatives are also recommended to prevent them from compromising on productivity and their capacity to cope with future shocks.",

        "content": "Asia Cup matches involving India could be played in Sri Lanka after the cricketing powerhouse refused to visit arch-rival and official host Pakistan, a board official told AFP. The Asian Cricket Council (ACC) is due to make a formal announcement in the coming week after calls for a different venue for Indias games in the 50-over tournament in September, a Sri Lankan official said. Neighbours India and Pakistan have not met on either sides soil in any version of the game since 2012, and only play each other in international tournaments on neutral grounds. The two cricketing powerhouses have fought three wars since being carved out of the subcontinents partition in 1947, and are bitter political rivals. It is very likely that some of the matches will be in Sri Lanka, the board official said, asking not to be named. But we have still not officially received confirmation. Sri Lankas board had expressed willingness to host some Asia Cup matches, despite an economic crisis which forced it to default on its 46 billion foreign debt in April last year. The official said it had the capacity to conduct an international tournament, even though the island was still emerging from the economic downturn. The Pakistan Cricket Board had threatened to boycott the World Cup in India, which is due to start in October, if the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) refused to play the Asia Cup in Pakistan a month earlier. The BCCI has since been looking to work out a plan to play the six-nation tournament at a neutral venue. Source: AFP --Agencies",

        "date": "June 13, 2023 12:40 pm",
        "content": "A mother-of-three has been jailed for more than two years for inducing an abortion after the legal limit. Carla Foster, 44, received the medication following a remote consultation where she was not honest about how far along her pregnancy was. The pills by post scheme, introduced in lockdown, allows pregnancies up to 10 weeks to be terminated at home. However, Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court heard the woman was between 32-34 weeks pregnant when she took them. Abortion is legal up to 24 weeks. However, after 10 weeks the procedure is carried out in a clinic. Prosecutors argued Foster had provided false information knowing she was over the time limit and had made online searches which they said indicated careful planning. The court heard between February and May 2020 she had searched how to hide a pregnancy bump, how to have an abortion without going to the doctor and how to lose a baby at six months. Based on the information she provided the British Pregnancy Advisory Service (BPAS), she was sent the tablets because it was estimated she was seven weeks pregnant. Her defence argued that lockdown and minimising face-to-face appointments had changed access to healthcare and so instead she had to search for information online. The defendant may well have made use of services had they been available at the time, said her barrister Barry White. This will haunt her forever. On 11 May 2020, having taken the abortion pills, an emergency call was made at 18:39 BST saying she was in labour. The baby was born not breathing during the phonecall and was confirmed dead about 45 minutes later. A post-mortem examination recorded the baby girls cause of death as stillbirth and maternal use of abortion drugs and she was estimated to be between 32 and 34 weeks gestation. Foster, from Staffordshire, already had three sons before she became pregnant again in 2019. The court heard she had moved back in with her estranged partner at the start of lockdown while carrying another mans baby. The judge accepted she was in emotional turmoil as she sought to hide the pregnancy. Foster was initially charged with child destruction, which she denied. She later pleaded guilty to an alternative charge of section 58 of the Offences Against the Person Act 1861, administering drugs or using instruments to procure abortion, which was accepted by the prosecution. Leniency letter not appropriate Sentencing, judge Mr Justice Edward Pepperall said it was a tragic case, adding that if she had pleaded guilty earlier he may have been able to consider suspending her jail sentence. He said the defendant was wracked by guilt and had suffered depression and said she was a good mother to three children, one of whom has special needs, who would suffer from her imprisonment. She received a 28-month sentence, 14 of which will be spent in custody with the remainder on licence. Ahead of Mondays hearing, a letter co-signed by a number of womens health organisations was sent to the court calling for a non-custodial sentence. However, the judge said it was not appropriate and that his duty was to apply the law as provided by Parliament. He told the defendant the letters authors were concerned that your imprisonment might deter other women from accessing telemedical abortion services and other late-gestation women from seeking medical care or from being open and honest with medical professionals. But he said it also has the capacity to be seen as special pleading by those who favour wider access to abortions and is, in my judgment, just as inappropriate as it would be for a judge to receive a letter from one of the groups campaigning for more restrictive laws. Archaic law The sentencing has sparked outcry among womens rights organisations and campaigners. BPAS said it was shocked and appalled by the womans sentence which they said was based on an archaic law. No woman can ever go through this again, said its chief executive, Clare Murphy. Over the last three years, there has been an increase in the numbers of women and girls facing the trauma of lengthy police investigations and threatened with up to life imprisonment under our archaic abortion law, she said. Vulnerable women in the most incredibly difficult of circumstances deserve more from our legal system. She said MPs must do more to offer protection so no more women in these desperate circumstances are threatened with prison again. Meanwhile, Labour MP Stella Creasy called for urgent reform. The average prison sentence for a violent offence in England is 18 months, she said in a tweet. A woman who had an abortion without following correct procedures just got 28 months under an 1868 act - we need urgent reform to make safe access for all women in England, Scotland and Wales a human right. The Crown Prosecution Service said: These exceptionally rare cases are complex and traumatic. Our prosecutors have a duty to ensure that laws set by Parliament are properly considered and applied when making difficult charging decisions. When asked whether the prime minister was confident criminalising abortion in some circumstances was the right approach, Rishi Sunaks official spokesperson said the current laws struck a balance. Our laws as they stand balance a womans right to access safe and legal abortions with the rights of an unborn child, he said. Im not aware of any plans to address that approach.

        "content": "The selection committee appointed to examine and ascertain the accuracy of the declarations submitted by the intended beneficiaries seeking welfare benefits has completed 95 of the verification process, State Minister of Finance Shehan Semasinghe says. Thus, the payments of all welfare benefits are expected to be made from July, under the Aswesuma welfare benefit scheme. The verification process will ensure that welfare benefits are given after a transparent selection process, by which the recipients can be identified, Semasinghe noted. The Aswesuma welfare benefits program, initiated by President Ranil Wickremesinghe as part of the social safety net to alleviate the ongoing economic crisis, is carried out under the purview of State Minister Semasinghe, with involvement from various government agencies, including the Ministry of Finance. Through this program, financial assistance will be provided to the lower-income group, comprising 40 of society, across four categories  transitional, vulnerable, poor and extremely poor. The government aims to offer LKR 15,000 per month to families falling under the extremely poor category. According to reports, the Welfare Benefit Board has received more than 3.7 million applications seeking this allowance.",

        "content": "Owing to the various import restrictions imposed on several items, including vehicles, Sri Lanka Customs has raised concerns about reaching their targeted revenue. The matter was brought to light during a meeting of the Sectoral Oversight Committee on National Economic and Physical Plans held recently under the chairmanship of MP Mahindananda Aluthgamage, focusing on the contributions Sri Lanka Customs can make towards increasing state revenue. Accordingly, Customs officials highlighted that they will not be able to achieve their targeted revenue for as long as the said import restrictions are in place, adding that with these restrictions in place, revenue of Rs. 783 billion is forecast for this year. They further noted that nearly 20 of their revenue is obtained through taxes collected from vehicle imports. In a bid to further illustrate this, officials belonging to Sri Lanka Customs noted that tax revenue of Rs. 923 billion was gained in 2018, which marks the highest revenue gained between 2014 and 2022, from which Rs. 194 billion was collected through vehicle taxes. Thus, they further noted that in the event the import restrictions on vehicles are relaxed this month, a total of Rs 150 billion can be earned over the next six months from the taxes imposed on vehicle imports alone.",

        "date": "June 13, 2023 06:13 pm",
        "content": "British police said a man had been arrested on suspicion of murder after three people were found dead on the street in the central English city of Nottingham and three were in hospital after an attempt to run them over with a van. Police said two people had been found dead on one road in the centre of the city just after 4 a.m. (0300 GMT) before officers were alerted to another incident not far away where someone driving a van had tried to run over three people. They are being treated in hospital. Another man was also found dead on a road just outside the city centre. This is an horrific and tragic incident which has claimed the lives of three people, Chief Constable Kate Meynell said. We believe these three incidents are all linked and we have a man in custody. This investigation is at its early stages and a team of detectives is working to establish exactly what has happened. A 31-year-old was arrested on suspicion of murder and was in police custody. No indication was given of motive, but the police statement made no mention of counter-terrorism officers being involved. It is too early to comment on casualties or the exact nature of the incident, the East Midlands Ambulance Service said. One woman identified as Lynn told BBC TV she had seen a van hit a man and a woman who were left lying in the street. He went straight into these two people. The woman went on the kerb, the man went up in the air, she said. There was such a bang. I wish I never saw it. Its really shaken me up. Inside one of the police cordons, officers guarded a white van that had its passenger door wide open with a rucksack lying on the ground beside it, and damage to its bonnet and windscreen. At Ilkeston Road, where the two people were found dead, medical equipment was strewn across the street. I am being kept updated on developments. The police must be given the time to undertake their work, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak wrote on Twitter, calling the incident shocking. Several major roads were closed and the Nottingham tram network was suspended. Members of the emergency services were visible across the city. Meynell said much of the city would remain sealed off while the investigation continued. Awful news for our city to wake up to today, Alex Norris, a lawmaker for Nottingham, said on Twitter. Our communitys thoughts and prayers are with all those affected. Source - Reuters - Agencies",

        "title": "Govt. says SOC did not consult with security agencies for report on SLT privatisation",
        "date": "June 13, 2023 06:33 pm",
        "content": "The report compiled by the Sectoral Oversight Committee (SOC) on National Security pertaining to the risks involved in the privatisation of Sri Lanka Telecom (SLT) did not involve any inquiry with the relevant authorities responsible for national security, the Presidents Media Division (PMD) stated. The matter was revealed during todays (13 June) Security Council meeting, the PMD said. Meanwhile, speaking during the 101 Katha talk show hosted by the PMD, former Director General of the Telecommunications Regulatory of Sri Lanka (TRCSL) Professor Rohan Samarajeewa assured that the privatisation of SLT does not pose a threat to national security. Expressing his opinion regarding the Sectorial Oversight Committees report on National Security, stating that it relies on assumptions and has turned national security into a mere slogan. He further said the report lacks a professional study and contradicts the standards set by the Sectorial Oversight Committee. Expanding on the subject, Prof. Samarajeeva highlighted the main reasons behind his stance. He pointed out the ignorance of both the present and the past, emphasizing that during the 1990s, Sri Lanka invited numerous firms, including Sri Lanka Telecom, which, at that time, did not possess a mobile phone network. Despite Mobitel being owned by an Australian company, the management rights were retained by an Australian company, and Mobitel had a history of serving the government due to the telecom firms ownership. Additionally, the operations of Mobitel were overseen by Telstra Corporation, a Japanese business was responsible for telecommunications, and the majority of decisions were made by Japanese CEOs, even though the chairman of Telecom was Sri Lankan. In the midst of the conflict, Sri Lanka had four mobile phone providers and three fixed phone businesses, with Dialog being the only corporation with a Sri Lankan CEO, although it was fully owned by Malaysia. Prof. Samarajeeva said the repetition of the phrase national security without proper examination, suggesting that it had become a mere mantra or slogan. He emphasized that when the government solely owned the telecom firm, all foreign calls were routed through the telecom headquarters in Colombo, and any harm to it would isolate Sri Lanka from the international community. Furthermore, he explained that even with cables and satellites, if the software system failed, the entire network would be disrupted, as there was no alternative system in place. He cited two bomb attacks by the LTTE that occurred on the same day to underscore the national security threat faced by the government-controlled telecom. Following privatization, Prof. Samarajeeva recommended that a Japanese corporation develop a backup system, which was promptly implemented, thanks to their investment. Prof. Samarajeeva noted that a government agency could not have achieved what the Japanese firm did, as most government organizations do not prioritize infrastructure security due to limited funds. He suggested that privatization, with appropriate controls, allows for investment and urged authorities to consider their recommendations seriously. As an example, he mentioned a case where Telecom and the Japanese corporation faced a one-million-dollar loss due to a mistake, but the customer was refunded. He also pointed out that during the 1990s, there was a monopoly on international calls, but now international connections are no longer solely dependent on telecom. He highlighted the use of Gmail for government communication and emphasized that the majority of government information is transmitted through the Gmail domain, which is foreign-owned. Additionally, politicians and government officials use WhatsApp, which is also owned by a foreign entity, to communicate. Prof. Samarajeeva argued that privatization does not mean government data is being compromised since data centres in Sri Lanka, including those of the telecom company and Dialog, are rented to store government data. He used the analogy of renting a part of a safety deposit box in a bank, where the control lies with the individual who leases the safe, not the bank. Thus, only the authorized personnel have access to government databases, and having a copy of the data stored outside Sri Lanka enhances security. He cautioned against the appointment of individuals with political connections to government institutions, as malpractice tends to occur in such cases. He stressed the importance of including knowledgeable individuals in Sectorial committees and encouraged other nations to adopt similar practices. Prof. Samarajeeva expressed disappointment over the submission of the report to Parliament, suggesting that it was influenced by the ideas of the Sectorial committees rather than relying on expert opinions. On 09 June, the SOC on National Security issued recommendations against the privatisation of SLT in a report titled The Effects of Privatization of Sri Lanka Telecom on National Security, citing the possible leakage of matters sensitive to national security.",

        "date": "June 13, 2023 08:55 pm",
        "content": "The Presidential Secretariat on Tuesday (June 13) strongly denied the claims published in multiple media reports asserting that 7.5 million Sri Lankans were lacking adequate meals. Speaking on the matter, the Additional Secretary of Presidential Secretariat Dr. Sulakshana Jayawardena noted that contrary to these reports, the Crop and Food Security Assessment Mission (CFSAM) report issued by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) indicate an improvement in food security across all provinces of Sri Lanka. According to a statement issued by the government, Dr. Jayawardena, who is also the Director-General of the Partnership Secretariat for WFP Cooperation (PSWFPC), has emphasized the credibility of the CFSAM report released on May 24, 2023, clarifying that it is accessible to the public on the FAO website. It is regrettable that the summarized accounts in various media reports did not align with the comprehensive findings of the CFSAM report, which can be easily cross-referenced with the report available on the relevant websites, he has said. The CFSAM survey reveals that an estimated 3.9 million people, equivalent to 17 per cent of the population, are moderately acutely food insecure, the government said adding that this figure represents a notable decrease of nearly 40 per cent compared to the previous years figures recorded in JuneJuly. Moreover, the severe acute food insecurity rate has declined from 66,000 individuals to approximately 10,000, the government emphasized. Stressing that the improvement in food security can be attributed to an increase in food consumption, which may be influenced by lower food expenses and higher incomes among agricultural communities during the assessment period coinciding with the harvest season, the government said the purpose of a CFSAM is to provide an accurate and comprehensive overview of the extent and severity of food insecurity, enabling the government and the international community to promptly and appropriately respond to the crisis and mitigate its impact on the affected populations. CFSAMs conduct a thorough analysis of the food security situation at both macro and micro levels, encompassing the overall economic climate, agricultural production, market conditions, and the supply-demand dynamics of staple foods, predominantly cereals. The result is the generation of a national cerealstaple food balance sheet (NFBS) and an estimation of any unmet requirement for staple food imports in the upcoming marketing year.",

        "date": "June 13, 2023 10:47 pm",
        "content": "Transparency International Sri Lanka (TISL) filed a petition in the Supreme Court on Monday (June 12), seeking to intervene in the ongoing Fundamental Rights case highlighting the serious allegations of bribery and corruption surrounding the X-Press Pearl disaster. The FR petition had been filed by the Center for Environmental Justice (CEJ) and three more petitioners. The TISL said the petition for intervention, filed in the public interest, refers to serious allegations of irregularity, mishandling, sabotage, bribery and corruption surrounding the claim for compensation arising from the X-Press Pearl disaster. The organization has raised the following key points in its petition for intervention: 1. The grave allegations of interference and extraneous pressure surrounding the claim for compensation arising from the X-Press Pearl disaster. 2. The statement by the Justice Minister in Parliament on April 25, 2023, that one Chamara Gunasekara alias Manjusiri Nissanka had received a payment of USD 250 million into a private bank account in connection with the X-Press Pearl disaster. 3. The media statements of Chinthaka Waragoda, who reportedly invented a machine to remove debris that washed ashore after the shipwreck, alleging that he was offered payment to discontinue the use of his machine, to avoid exposing the full extent of the damage caused by the disaster. 4. Questions surrounding the quantum of compensation due to Sri Lanka for the damages caused by MV X-Press Pearl. The freight ship MV X-Press Pearl caught fire off the coast of Colombo on May 20, 2021. It sank a few days later, releasing its cargo of plastic pellets and tons of toxic chemicals into the ocean, causing what is known as Sri Lankas worst maritime disaster to date. Allegations are rife that Sri Lankan authorities obtained the assistance of the International Tanker Owners Pollution Federation Limited (ITOPF), a representative of the insurer of the Shipowner, in the post-disaster activities, despite the grave conflict of interest arising from it, the TISL pointed out. The organization has urged that the private parties involved in the X-Press Pearl incident be held accountable, and be made to pay optimal compensation for the damage and pollution caused to the marine and coastal ecology of Sri Lanka, and the payment of compensation for the loss caused to the fishing communities and those engaged in tourism, as well as obtaining compensation under the Marine Pollution Prevention Act. TISL has also highlighted the need to hold anyone guilty of wrongdoing fully accountable. The petition for intervention is fixed for support in the Supreme Court on Thursday (June 15).",

        "title": "Potential first-ever chikungunya vaccine shows positive results",
        "date": "June 13, 2023 11:52 pm",
        "content": "French-Austrian drugmaker Valnevas vaccine candidate against chikungunya, a mosquito-borne virus that causes occasional outbreaks across the world, showed promising results in a large new trial, a study said on Tuesday. While the results were hailed as good news in the fight against chikungunya, the trial was carried out on people in the United States, where the virus is extremely rare, with experts saying more research was needed. There are currently no vaccines or treatments available for the virus, which causes fever and sometimes debilitating joint pain, though it is rarely fatal. Valneva says that its vaccine candidate, called VLA1553, is the first to be reviewed by health authorities after applying for approval in the US and Canada. The new randomised, placebo-controlled phase three trial aimed to find out how often the live-attenuated vaccine, which uses a weakened form of the virus, produced an immune response. Out of a subgroup of 266 people who received the vaccine, 263 -- 99 percent -- developed antibodies that could neutralise the chikungunya virus, according to the study published in The Lancet journal. In a broader trial of 4,100 healthy adults, the single-shot vaccine was deemed generally safe, with side effects similar to other vaccines. Only two people developed serious side effects linked to the vaccine, the study said, and both fully recovered. Martina Schneider, Valnevas clinical strategy manager and the lead author of the study, called the results promising. This could be the first chikungunya vaccine available for people living in endemic regions, as well as for travellers to endemic areas or areas at risk for an upcoming outbreak, she said in a statement. Outbreak trials crucial Public health experts have expressed concerns that chikungunya could be a potential future pandemic threat as climate change pushes the mosquitoes that spread it into new regions. Kathryn Stephenson, an infectious disease specialist at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in the US, said the new study was good news for chikungunya virus pandemic preparedness. But the vaccine might be less effective in areas with a built-up immunity to chikungunya, which can happen with such live-attenuated shots, she added. Since chikungunya was first identified in Tanzania in 1952, it has been recorded in more than 110 countries, according to the World Health Organization. Occasional but severe outbreaks take place in Africa, Asia and the Americas. Valneva has said the US Food and Drug Administration could make a decision on approving the vaccine at the end of August. The biotech firm told AFP that it plans to submit an application to the European Unions drug watchdog, the EMA, in the second half of 2023. The company is also trialling the vaccine among adolescents in areas of Brazil where the virus is endemic. Stephenson said the Brazilian trial and further research conducted during actual chikungunya outbreaks were crucial to establishing the vaccines effectiveness. A chikungunya vaccine candidate developed by Denmarks Bavarian Nordic is also undergoing phase three trials. Source: AFP -Agencies",

        "date": "June 14, 2023 07:48 am",
        "content": "MIAMI (AP)  Donald Trump became the first former president to face a judge on federal charges as he pleaded not guilty in a Miami courtroom Tuesday to dozens of felony counts accusing him of hoarding classified documents and refusing government demands to give them back. The history-making court date, centered on charges that Trump mishandled government secrets that as commander-in-chief he was entrusted to protect, kickstarts a legal process that will unfold at the height of the 2024 presidential campaign and carry profound consequences not only for his political future but also for his own personal liberty. Trump approached his arraignment with characteristic bravado, posting social media broadsides against the prosecution from inside his motorcade en route to the courthouse and insisting  as he has through years of legal woes  that he has done nothing wrong and was being persecuted for political purposes. But inside the courtroom, he sat silently, scowling and arms crossed, as a lawyer entered a not guilty plea on his behalf in a brief arraignment that ended without him having to surrender his passport or otherwise restrict his travel. The arraignment, though largely procedural in nature, was the latest in an unprecedented reckoning this year for Trump, who faces charges in New York arising from hush money payments during his 2016 presidential campaign as well as ongoing investigations in Washington and Atlanta into efforts to undo the results of the 2020 race. Always in campaign mode, he swiftly pivoted from the solemn courtroom to a festive restaurant, stopping on his way out of Miami at Versailles, an iconic Cuban spot in the citys Little Havana neighborhood where supporters serenaded Trump, who turns 77 on Wednesday, with Happy Birthday. The back-to-back events highlight the tension for Trump in the months ahead as he balances the pageantry of campaigning with courtroom stops accompanying his status as a twice-indicted criminal defendant. Yet the gravity of the moment was unmistakable. Until last week, no former president had ever been charged by the Justice Department, let alone accused of mishandling top-secret information. The indictment unsealed last week charged Trump with 37 felony counts  many under the Espionage Act  that accuse him of illegally storing classified documents in his bedroom, bathroom, shower and other locations at Mar-a-Lago and trying to hide them from the Justice Department as investigators demanded them back. The charges carry a yearslong prison sentence in the event of a conviction. Trump has relied on a familiar playbook of painting himself as a victim of political persecution. He attacked the Justice Department special counsel who filed the case as a thug and deranged, pledged to remain in the race no matter what and addressed supporters Tuesday night at his Bedminster, New Jersey, golf club, where he delivered a roughly half-hour speech full of repeated falsehoods and incendiary rhetoric and threatened to go after President Joe Biden and his family if elected. The seal is broken by what theyve done. They should never have done this, Trump said of the indictment. But Attorney General Merrick Garland, an appointee of President Joe Biden, sought to insulate the department from political attacks by handing ownership of the case last November to a special counsel, Jack Smith, who on Friday declared, We have one set of laws in this country, and they apply to everyone. Smith attended Tuesdays arraignment, sitting in the front row behind his team of prosecutors. The court appearance unfolded against angst over potential protests, with some high-profile backers using barbed rhetoric to voice support. Though city officials said they prepared for possible unrest, there were few signs of significant disruption. Trump didnt say a word during the court appearance, other than to occasionally turn and whisper to his attorneys who were seated on either side of him. He fiddled with a pen and clasped his hands on the table in front of him as the lawyers and the judge debated the conditions of his release. While he was not required to surrender a passport  prosecutors said he was not considered a flight risk  the magistrate judge presiding over the arraignment directed Trump to not discuss the case with certain witnesses. That includes Walt Nauta, his valet who was indicted last week on charges that he moved boxes of documents at Trumps direction and misled the FBI about it. Nauta did not enter a plea Tuesday because he did not have a local lawyer with him. Trump attorney Todd Blanche objected to the idea of imposing restrictions on the former presidents contact with possible witnesses, noting they include many people close to Trump, including staff and members of his protection detail. Many of the people he interacts with on a daily basis  including the men and women who protect him  are potential witnesses in this case, Blanche said. Trump, who has repeatedly insisted that he did nothing wrong, showed no emotion as he was led by law enforcement out of the courtroom through a side door. Even for a man whose presidency and post-White House life have been defined by criminal investigations, the documents probe had long stood out both because of the volume of evidence that prosecutors had seemed to amass and the severity of the allegations. A federal grand jury in Washington had heard testimony for months, but the Justice Department filed the case in Florida, where Trumps Mar-a-Lago resort is located and where many of the alleged acts of obstruction occurred. Though Trump appeared Tuesday before a federal magistrate, the case has been assigned to a District Court judge he appointed, Aileen Cannon, who ruled in his favor last year in a dispute over whether an outside special master could be appointed to review the seized classified documents. A federal appeals panel ultimately overturned her ruling. Its unclear what defenses Trump is likely to invoke as the case moves forward. Two of his lead lawyers announced their resignation the morning after his indictment, and the notes and recollections of another attorney, M. Evan Corcoran, are cited repeatedly throughout the 49-page charging document, suggesting prosecutors envision him as a potential key witness. The indictment Friday accuses Trump of illegally retaining national security documents that he took with him from the White House to Mar-a-Lago after leaving office in January 2021. The documents he stored, prosecutors say, included material on nuclear programs, defense and weapons capabilities of the U.S. and foreign governments and a Pentagon attack plan, prosecutors say. He is accused of showing off some to people who didnt have security clearances to view them. Beyond that, according to the indictment, he repeatedly sought to obstruct government efforts to recover the documents, including by directing Nauta to move boxes and also suggesting to his own lawyer that he hide or destroy documents sought by a Justice Department subpoena.

        "content": "French President, Emmanuel Macron has extended an invitation to his Sri Lanka counterpart Ranil Wickremesinghe to address a high-level panel discussion in Paris at the Global Leaders Summit for a New Global Financing Pact. The event is scheduled to take place at the Palais Brongniart in Paris on June 22 and 23. The Summit for a New Global Financing Pact is expected to shape a new financing toolbox that will be rolled out through six high-level round-tables and 40 parallel events. The Summit will provide the opportunity to examine interactions between multilateral development bank reform, mobilisation of private capital, climate finance, green infrastructure and solutions related to debt. The Summit for New Global Financing Pact will establish the principles for future reforms and pave the way towards a more balanced financial partnership between the North and South. It will set the stage for new agreements to relieve debt distress. It is also expected to enable more countries to access the financing they need to invest in sustainable development, to better protect nature and cut emissions, as well as help protect populations from climate change wherever most needed. New Global Financing Pact will help define the principles and steps needed to reform the financial system and to combat the high levels of debt that tie governments hands when it comes to implement ambitious climate action to reduce the climate, economic and technological gaps that threaten to divide up the world. This inclusive, multi-stakeholder event will bring together Heads of State and Government, leaders of international organizations, and representatives of civil society, foundations, funds and the private sector. During his stay in France, Wickremesinghe will meet with Paris Club creditors to discuss matters pertaining to Sri Lankas debt crisis. -with inputs from agencies",
