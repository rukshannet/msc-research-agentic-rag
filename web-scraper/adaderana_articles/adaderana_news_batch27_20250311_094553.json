        "date": "July 29, 2024 01:35 pm",
        "content": "Scientists have made another major stride toward the long-sought goal of diagnosing Alzheimers disease with a simple blood test. On Sunday, a team of researchers reported that a blood test was significantly more accurate than doctors interpretation of cognitive tests and CT scans in signaling the condition. The study, published Sunday in the journal JAMA, found that about 90 per cent of the time the blood test correctly identified whether patients with memory problems had Alzheimers. Dementia specialists using standard methods that did not include expensive PET scans or invasive spinal taps were accurate 73 per cent of the time, while primary care doctors using those methods got it right only 61 per cent of the time. The results, presented Sunday at the Alzheimers Association International Conference in Philadelphia, are the latest milestone in the search for affordable and accessible ways to diagnose Alzheimers, a disease that afflicts more than 32 million people worldwide. Medical experts say the findings bring the field closer to a day when people might receive routine blood tests for cognitive impairment as part of primary care checkups, similar to the way they receive cholesterol tests. In recent years, several blood tests have been developed for Alzheimers. They are used mostly to screen participants in clinical trials and by some specialists to help pinpoint if a patients dementia is caused by Alzheimers or another condition. The new research was conducted in Sweden, and experts cautioned that, for use in the United States, the results should be confirmed in a diverse American population. Experts emphasized that blood tests should be only one step in a screening process and, most importantly, should be used only for people with memory loss and other symptoms of cognitive decline  not for people who are cognitively healthy to predict if they will develop Alzheimers. Testing recommendations could change if scientists find drugs that can delay or halt Alzheimers pathology in people who have not yet developed cognitive problems. Medical experts also said that blood tests should be performed only after administering tests that assess memory and thinking abilities and CT scans that seek alternative causes like strokes or brain tumors. And blood test results should be confirmed by one of the gold-standard methods: PET scans or spinal taps to measure a protein, amyloid, that accumulates and forms plaques in the brains of patients with Alzheimers. - This article originally appeared in The New York Times Source: Irish Times --Agencies",

        "date": "July 29, 2024 03:49 pm",
        "content": "Victorious Sri Lanka captain Chamari Athapaththu believes her sides success in the Womens Asia Cup was well deserved as the island nation turns its attention to this years ICC Womens T20 World Cup. Sri Lanka claimed their first Womens Asia Cup title on Sunday, with Athapaththu leading from the front with a hard-fought half-century to help her team chase down Indias total of 1656 with eight balls remaining. The victory helps cap off a tremendous 14-month period for Sri Lanka, who have claimed T20I series triumphs over Bangladesh, England and South Africa in recent times as well winning the ICC Womens T20 World Cup Qualifier tournament to earn a place at this years tournament in October. That will be the next challenge for Athapaththu and Sri Lanka, but the experienced skipper is excited about what her side can achieve at the T20 World Cup in Bangladesh. We sacrificed a lot for the last 10-15 years. Finally we won this award, this trophy, Athapaththu said after she won the Player of the Tournament award at the Asia Cup. Weve played really good cricket the last 12 months. We beat England, South Africa, West Indies, New Zealand. We won (T20) World Cup qualifiers, now we won Asia Cup. Its no surprise that Athapaththu has been leading from the front with both bat and ball Sri Lankas recent run of form, but the veteran all-rounder is now getting plenty of support from her teammates with the likes of Harshitha Samarawickrama, Kavisha Dilhari and Udeshika Prabodhani stepping up to show their wares during different stages of the Asia Cup. Samarawickrama played a vital role in scoring her own half-century alongside Athapaththu against India in the Asia Cup decider, while Dilhari and Prabodhani finished the tournament among the top 10 wicket-takers at the event. It has Athapaththu buoyant about what the future holds for Sri Lanka and the 34-year-old wants to continue playing for her side for at least another 12 months and be present at next years ICC Womens Cricket World Cup in India. Athapaththu had recently been hinting at retirement from the international game, but the star all-rounder wants to be part of at least two more ICC tournaments. Hopefully Ill still play until the next 50-over World Cup, Athapaththu added. --ICC--",

        "date": "July 29, 2024 04:24 pm",
        "content": "More than 5000 people isolated by flooding in northwest North Korea have been rescued in airlifts and other evacuation work state media says was supervised by leader Kim Jong Un. Heavy rainfall on Saturday caused a river on the North Korean-Chinese border to exceed a dangerous level and created a grave crisis, the official Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) said on Monday. About 10 military helicopters and navy and government boats were mobilised for the evacuation efforts in Sinuiju city and Uiju town where flooding had isolated residents. KCNA did not mention any deaths or how much damage the flooding caused. It said each of the about 10 helicopters made several fights to save the residents despite bad weather, ultimately rescuing 4200 people by air. It said Kim guided the evacuation works on Sunday, ordered food and other necessities to be provided to affected people and set tasks for recovery and relief works. KCNA cited Kim as calling the rescue works miraculous as more than 5000 people were saved. Summer floods in North Korea often cause serious damage to farmlands due to poor drainage, deforestation and dilapidated infrastructure. Typhoons and torrential rains in 2020 were among the difficulties Kim previously said had created multiple crises at home, along with draconian pandemic-related restrictions and UN sanctions over his nuclear weapons program. During his visit to the flooded region, Kim scolded officials for lowering their guard, saying he had ordered efforts to prevent flood damage more than once, KCNA said. They, seized with defeatism at combat with nature, do not confidently turn out in the disaster prevention work, only expecting chance from the sky, Kim said, according to KCNA. Kims criticism could be seen as an effort to shift blame while establishing his own image as a leader caring about his people while North Korea struggles with economic difficulties and international isolation, observers say.

        "date": "July 29, 2024 09:20 pm",
        "content": "The Secretary to the Ministry of Ports, Naval, and Aviation Services, K. D. S. Ruwanchandra, emphasized that Alphaliner, a prominent research publication in the shipping industry, recognized Colombo Port as the worlds fastest-growing port in the first quarter of 2024 due to its remarkable operational performance and 23.6 growth rate. He added that the port generated an income of USD 50 million in the first quarter of 2024, emphasizing that the various trade union actions taken in the past did not impede this progress. Addressing a press briefing held under the series titled Two Years of Progress and Way Forward, held at the Presidential Media Centre (PMC) today (29), Secretary to the Ministry of Ports, Shipping, and Aviation Services further elaborated: To begin with, I would like to highlight the significant progress in the operational performance of the Colombo Port, which achieved an impressive growth rate of 23.6 in 2024. As a result, Alphaliner, a leading research publication in the shipping industry, recognized the Colombo Port as the worlds fastest-growing port in the first quarter of 2024. We accomplished this progress despite various trade union actions, which did not hinder our operations. In 2023, the Sri Lanka Port Authority reported a profit of USD 100 million, and in just the first quarter of 2024, it has already made a profit of USD 50 million. All four terminals have significantly contributed to these operations, with on-going efforts to enhance their operational capacity. Construction of the Eastern Container Terminal (ECT) and the Western Terminal is in progress, with the Western Terminal expected to begin operations in February 2025. Additionally, development work is underway at the Eastern Terminal and Northern Port. Meanwhile, development projects are being carried out at Trincomalee, Galle, and Kankasanthurai ports. A passenger ferry service from India operates every Friday using the newly constructed terminal building at the Kankasanthurai Port. Airline operations have improved by 25 compared to 2023, with significant increases in both passenger and cargo services. The number of air service arrivals has risen from 36 in 2023 to 46 by July 2024. Eng. Athula Galketiya, Chairman of Airport and Aviation Services (Sri Lanka) Ltd. (AASL), said: By July 2024, there have been 4.3 million international passenger movements, and we anticipate that this number will reach around 9 million by the end of the next six months, reflecting a 26.10 growth compared to July 2023. Additionally, international air traffic increased by 24.50 by June 2024 compared to June 2023, while air cargo movement rose by 28.96 in the same period. Our terminal handled approximately 10.8 million air passengers in 2018, but there are challenges in providing adequate facilities. Therefore, many short-term and long-term measures are currently being implemented to improve facilities for 8 to 9 million passengers. The tender aims to improve the departure area of the first external terminal, with the award likely happening next month. Additionally, 30 more counters will be added to the departure area of the new building, along with the construction of four e-gates each for arrivals and departures, streamlining the immigration and emigration processes. We expect to resume construction on the proposed second terminal for the Bandaranaike International Airport soon. Negotiations with Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) are underway, and they are expected to provide the necessary loan facility by next month as promised. We plan to issue tenders by mid-September, begin construction by mid-next year, and complete it by the end of 2028, aiming to accommodate about 9 million more passengers. The resignation of Air Traffic Controllers due to salary issues has been resolved with government intervention. However, approximately 80 Air Traffic Controllers have left the country. In response, the government has decided to recruit new Air Traffic Controllers. So far, a team of over 25 has been recruited, trained, and assigned to duty. Additionally, applications for another group have already been called. --PMD",

        "content": "The Cabinet of Ministers has approved the drafting of necessary legislation based on the recommendations of the K.T. Chitrasiri report to address and resolve the issues faced by Sri Lanka Cricket. A new constitution has been drafted by the said committee for Sri Lanka Cricket. Accordingly, the Cabinet of Ministers has approved the joint proposal presented by the Minister of Foreign Affairs, the Minister of Power and Energy, the Minister of Labour and Foreign Employment and the Minister of Public Security to instruct the Legal Draftsman for preparation of a bill to formally approve and implement the new constitution. Known as the Chitrasiri Committee, the panel proposed a structure where the SLC would be governed by an 18-member board of directors. The government stepped in to overhaul the structure when then sports minister Roshan Ranasinghe dismissed the current SLC administration, replacing it with an interim committee. Ranasinghes decision resulted in Sri Lankas ICC membership being suspended, and the SLC lost its right to host the U-19 World Cup, which was subsequently held in South Africa. The current SLC management election process has faced severe criticism for excessive vote buying aimed at maintaining the status quo at the helm of the organization. The proposed new law aims to set term limits while altering the voting structure to ensure fairer governance. (With inputs from agencies)",

        "date": "July 30, 2024 11:23 am",
        "content": "At least 41 people were killed and scores injured after landslides in the hills of Indias southern Kerala state, local media reported, with rescue operations obstructed after a main bridge collapsed in the region. State Health Minister Veena George said that over 70 people were injured and the Indian Express reported that many people are likely to have been washed away in the Chaliyar river. The situation is serious. The government has pressed all agencies into rescue, state Forest Minister A K Saseendran told Reuters after the landslides in the Wayanad district of the state. More rain was predicted through the day. The army was roped in to build a temporary bridge after a bridge in the district that linked the affected area, mostly tea and cardamom estates, to the nearest town of Chooralmala was destroyed, Saseendran added. Local news channel Asianet TV said as many as 41 people died after the landslides caused havoc in the region. Television visuals showed relief personnel making their way through rocks and uprooted trees as muddy water gushed through, with many houses destroyed. One man was seen struggling to free himself after being stuck in chest-high mud for hours, as rescue workers were not able to reach him despite multiple efforts. Rashid Padikkalparamban, a resident involved in the relief efforts, said there were at least three landslides in the area starting around midnight, which washed away the bridge connecting the affected area, the Mundakkai estates, to Chooralmala. Many people who were working in the estates and staying in makeshift tents inside are feared trapped or missing, he said. Kerala is prone to heavy rain and flooding, with nearly 400 people killed in one of the worst floods in 2018. Relief efforts were ongoing on Tuesday, and two helicopters of the Indian Air Force have been mobilised, the Kerala chief ministers office said in a statement. Rescue operations were hampered as the area was not reachable by road because of the bridge collapse, Mohsen Shahedi, a senior National Disaster Response Force officer told Reuters. Rahul Gandhi, who won the recently-contested general election from Wayanad, but resigned as he was also elected from his family bastion in the north, said he had spoken to the state chief minister to ensure coordination with all agencies.

        "content": "The Court of Appeal is scheduled to deliver its decision on August 09 regarding the petition filed by Keheliya Rambukwella, seeking an order to invalidate the Maligakanda Magistrates Courts order remanding him until the end of the trial over the alleged import of substandard medicine. The court will also address his bail application on the same date. This decision was previously expected to be delivered on August 01. The Criminal Investigation Department (CID) arrested Rambukwella on 02 February over his alleged complicity in the procurement of substandard IVIG vials. The arrest came hot on the heels of pressure from civil society activists and health sector trade unionists, who called for the immediate apprehension of the lawmaker. In October 2023, the National Medicines Regulatory Authority (NMRA) revealed that forged documents were found to have been submitted for Customs clearance to procure a batch of vials containing human immunoglobulin, an antibody produced by blood plasma cells, which later failed the quality tests. Prior to the apprehension of Rambukwella, seven arrests had been made in connection with the drug procurement scam. But the fifth accused was later released on bail. As such, the former Health Secretary, the Director of the Health Ministrys Medical Supplies Division (MSD) and three other officials of the same division, as well as the owner of the company, which is said to have supplied the substandard batch of immunoglobulin vials, were in remand custody. Meanwhile, one of the suspects who was arrested and remanded in connection with the case was released on bail when the case was previously taken up on May 06. Accordingly, the former Deputy Director of the Medical Supplies Division of the Health Ministry, Dr. Thusitha Sudarshana had been released on bail. Meanwhile, on July 25, the Court of Appeal ordered the Maligakanda Magistrates Court to release on bail the former Director of the Health Ministrys Medical Supplies Division, Dr. Kapila Wickramanayake, who was also in remand custody. The Court of Appeal had issued the order to the Maligakanda Magistrates Court to release Dr. Wickramanayake under suitable bail conditions, after considering a writ petition filed by his attorneys.",

        "date": "July 30, 2024 03:02 pm",
        "content": "(Reuters) - Venezuelas opposition said it had voting-tally proof it had won the election claimed by President Nicolas Maduro, as anti-government protests erupted across the country, with police firing tear gas to disperse protesters in the capital Caracas. Protesters took to the streets after Maduro was declared winner of the disputed poll, including near the presidential Miraflores palace in Caracas. Many staged cacerolazo demonstrations across the country - a traditional Latin American protest in which people bang pots and pans. Some who later marched took their pots and pans with them. I dont want gold, I dont want CLAP (the government food aid programme), I want Nicolas (Maduro) to leave, chanted protesters banging pots. Many rode motorbikes and jammed streets or draped themselves in the Venezuelan flag, while others covered their faces with scarves as protection against tear gas. In Caracas, heavily armed police sent protesters running when they fired tear gas to disperse a crowd, while other police erected barriers with long shields and batons. In Coro, the capital of Falcon state, protesters cheered and danced when they tore down a statue depicting late president Hugo Chavez, Maduros mentor. The Venezuelan Conflict Observatory said it had registered 187 protests in 20 states as of 6 p.m.. Ill fight for my countrys democracy. They stole the election from us, an unidentified protester told Reuters. We need to keep on fighting for the youth. MADURO BLAMES EXTREME RIGHT Maduro, in a live broadcast from the presidential palace, said his forces were acting against what he called violent protesters. The armed forces have long supported Maduro and there are no signs leaders were breaking from the government. We have been following all of the acts of violence promoted by the extreme right. I can tell the people of Venezuela that if they have done harm, we are acting, he said. We already know this movie, so once more, long with the civil, military and police union we are acting. We already know how they operate. The Venezuelan Conflict Observatory said numerous acts of repression and violence carried out by paramilitary collectives and security forces have been reported. At least two people were killed in connection with the vote count or protests - one overnight in the border state of Tachira and another in Maracay on Monday. Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino warned against allowing a repeat of the terrible situations of 2014, 2017 and 2019. Anti-government protesters took to the streets those years and hundreds were killed. OPPOSITION SAYS PROOF OF VICTORY Electoral authorities said on Monday that Maduro had won a third term as president with 51 of the vote, extending a quarter-century of socialist rule. But the opposition said the 73 of voting tallies to which it has access showed its candidate Edmundo Gonzalez had won an unassailable victory, winning more than twice as many votes as Maduro. Independent pollsters called Maduros claim of victory implausible, and governments in Washington and elsewhere immediately cast doubt on the results and called for a full tabulation of votes. Uruguays Foreign Minister Omar Paganini told CNN in an interview on Monday that his government will never recognize Maduro as the winner, saying the opposition had clearly won. Perus government ordered Venezuelan diplomats in the Andean nation to leave within 72 hours, citing serious and arbitrary decisions made today by the Venezuelan regime. Peru is home to one of the largest communities of Venezuelan migrants, most of whom have fled their homeland in recent years. The Organization of American States said it would meeting on Wednesday in Washington to discuss the Venezuela election. MORE STREET PROTESTS Opposition leader Maria Corina Machado, who was barred from running in the poll, called in a post on X late on Monday for supporters to march on Tuesday. My dear Venezuelans, tomorrow we meet; as a family, organized, demonstrating the determination we have to make every vote count and defend the truth, she said. Jorge Rodriguez, a ruling party lawmaker and Maduros campaign manager, urged government followers to take part in marches to the presidential palace to support the government. While Gonzalez has warned against violence, Rodriguez accused the opposition of stoking violence. Maduro - a 61-year-old former bus driver and foreign minister - took office on reelection is president Hugo Chavezs death in 2013 and his 2018 considered fraudulent by the United States and others, who call him a dictator. Maduro has presided over an economic collapse, the migration of about a third of the population, and a sharp deterioration in diplomatic relations, crowned by sanctions imposed by the United States, the European Union and others which have crippled an already struggling oil industry.

        "date": "July 30, 2024 03:53 pm",
        "content": "The Colombo District Court has ordered to further extend the interim injunction order issued preventing the Sri Lanka Freedom Partys (SLFP) Executive Committee from removing Duminda Dissanayake, Lasantha Alagiyawanna and Mahinda Amaraweera from their respective positions in the party, until October 9. The Colombo District Judge Sandun Withana issued this order when a plaint filed by the relevant MPs was taken up today (30). Petitioners Lasantha Alagiyawanna, Duminda Dissanayake and Mahinda Amaraweera claim that the decision taken by former President Maithripala Sirisena and others to arbitrarily remove them from their positions in the SLFP was completely unlawful. They have filed these petitions before the Colombo District Court seeking an order to invalidate those decisions of the SLFP executive committee. A group of individuals including former President Maithripala Sirisena and Acting General Secretary of SLFP Sarathi Dushmantha Mithrapala have been named as respondents of the relevant plaints, through which an order is sought declaring that the decision taken by the partys executive committee to expel them without any disciplinary investigation to be unlawful. The Executive Committee of the SLFP decided to remove Dissanayake, Alagiyawanna and Amaraweera from their respective positions in the party, during a special party meeting held on March 30. Accordingly, Dissanayake was stripped of his post as the National Organizer, Alagiyawanna was removed as the Treasurer and Amaraweera as the Senior Vice President. Meanwhile, SLFP also appointed a new Senior Vice President, a Treasurer and a National Organizer after the trio was stripped of their respective positions. Thereby, SLFPs Mahiyanganaya Constituency Organizer K. P. Gunawardena was appointed to the post of National Organizer, former Western Provincial Minister Hector Bethmage as the Treasurer and former Central Province Chief Minister Sarath Ekanayake as the Senior Vice President. This decision was communicated to SLFP members during a special party meeting convened by the Chairman of the SLFP, former President Maithripala Sirisena, amidst the controversy of his statements regarding the Easter attacks masterminds.",

        "date": "July 30, 2024 04:11 pm",
        "content": "The Election Commission has decided to write to President Ranil Wickremesinghe urging for a prompt solution to the issue concerning the post of the Inspector General of Police (IGP). The decision was taken during a meeting of the Election Commission, which was held this morning (30) at the Election Secretariat premises in Rajagiriya. It is reported that special attention was directed towards several matters related to holding the presidential election, during the meeting. This is also the first time that the Election Commission convened a meeting after the announcement of the 2024 presidential election. President Wickremesinghe had recently emphasized that the issue regarding the appointment of the IGP will be resolved within a week through consultation with the Speaker and the Chief Justice. The President stated that he is fully committed to holding the presidential election on September 21 and will not consider postponing it beyond that date, as elections are an essential aspect of the peoples sovereignty and must never be violated. On July 24, the Supreme Court issued an interim order preventing Deshabandu Tennakoon from performing duties and functioning in the position of the IGP. The Supreme Court had issued this order after granting leave to proceed with the nine petitions, filed by several parties including Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith, challenging Tennakoons appointment as the IGP. The Supreme Court had also ordered the President to name a suitable person for the position of IGP, for the duration of the interim order being enforced against Deshabandu Tennakoon. It was later reported that given the upcoming Presidential Election, President Wickremesinghe has been advised by his legal team that appointing an Acting IGP every two weeks could lead to election petitions against him. Consequently, the President had reportedly informed the Speaker of Parliament that he will refrain from getting involved in this matter. Delivering a special statement in Parliament the following day on the government stance on the matter, Prime Minister Dinesh Gunawardena clarified that the President has no legal provisions at this moment to appoint an Acting IGP. The Prime Minister also emphasized that the position of the IGP is not vacated presently. He also stated that the court cannot change the approval granted by the Constitutional Council to appoint the current IGP. We remind the Speaker and Parliament that the order of the Supreme Court suspending the duties of the IGP should be nullified. We request the Speaker to intervene as soon as possible in this regard, he said. Following the PMs statement, the Speaker of the Parliament Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena had informed the House that the decision to appoint the Inspector General of Police (IGP) was correct, legal, constitutional, and made in good faith. He further said that the situation with regard to the IGP cannot be resolved even by the President, and the matter must be sorted out in court if necessary.",

        "title": "US senate set to pass bill designed to protect kids from dangerous online content",
        "date": "July 30, 2024 04:53 pm",
        "content": "The US senate is expected to pass legislation Tuesday that is designed to protect children from dangerous online content, pushing forward with what would be the first major effort by Congress in decades to hold tech companies more accountable for the harm that they cause. The bill has sweeping bipartisan support and has been pushed by parents of children who died by suicide after online bullying. It would force companies to take reasonable steps to prevent harm on online platforms frequently used by minors, requiring them to exercise duty of care and ensure that they generally default to the safest settings possible. Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, who wrote the bill with Republican Sen. Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee, said the bill is about allowing children, teens and parents to take back control of their lives online, and to say to big tech, we no longer trust you to make decisions for us. The House has not yet acted on the bill, but Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., has said he will look at the bill and try to find consensus. Supporters are hoping that a strong vote in the Senate  a test vote last week moved the bill forward on an 86-1 vote  would push the House to act. If the bill becomes law, companies would be required to mitigate harm to children, including bullying and violence, the promotion of suicide, eating disorders, substance abuse, sexual exploitation and advertisements for illegal products such as narcotics, tobacco or alcohol. To do that, social media platforms would have to provide minors with options to protect their information, disable addictive product features and opt out of personalized algorithmic recommendations. They would also be required to limit other users from communicating with children and limit features that increase, sustain, or extend the use of the platform  such as autoplay for videos or platform rewards. The idea, Blumenthal and Blackburn say, is for the platforms to be safe by design. As they have written the bill, the two senators have worked to find a balance in which companies would become more responsible for what children see online while also ensuring that Congress does not go too far in regulating what individuals post  an effort to appease lawmakers in both parties who worry regulation could impose on freedom of expression and also open up an eventual law to legal challenges. In addition to First Amendment concerns, some critics have said the legislation could harm vulnerable kids who wouldnt be able to access information on LGBTQ issues or reproductive rights  although the bill has been revised to address many of those concerns, and major LGBTQ groups have decided to support the proposed legislation. The bill would be the first major tech regulation package to move in years. While there has long been bipartisan support for the idea that the biggest technology companies should face more government scrutiny, there has been little consensus on how it should be done. Congress passed legislation earlier this year that would force China-based social media company TikTok to sell or face a ban, but that law only targets one company. Some tech companies, like Microsoft, X and Snap, are supporting the bill. Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, has not taken a position. In a statement last week, Snap praised the bill and said in a statement that the safety and well-being of young people on Snapchat is a top priority. The bill also includes an update to child privacy laws that prohibit online companies from collecting personal information from users under 13, raising that age to 17. It would also ban targeted advertising to teenagers and allow teens or guardians to delete a minors personal information. As the bill stalled in recent months, Blumenthal and Blackburn have also worked closely with the parents of children who have died by suicide after cyberbullying or otherwise been harmed by social media, including dangerous social media challenges, extortion attempts, eating disorders and drug deals. At a tearful news conference last week, the parents said they were pleased that the Senate is finally moving ahead with the legislation. Maurine Molak, the mother of a 16-year-old who died by suicide after months of relentless and threatening cyberbullying, said she believes the bill can save lives. She urged every senator to vote for it. Anyone who believes that childrens well-being and safety should come before big techs greed ought to put their mark on this historic legislation, Molak said.

Immaterial of the decision made by the political bureau of SLPP, together with the majority of parliamentary members, I will continue to support President Ranil Wickremesinghe in the upcoming presidential election, who rescued the country at the most crucial time, Tennakoon said. Similarly, State Minister of Finance Shehan Semasinghe also expressed his support for President Wickremesinghe on X. Under President Ranil Wickremesinghes leadership, Sri Lanka has made significant strides in overcoming the most severe crises in history. His clear and decisive leadership has guided the nation toward stability and growth. To prevent a return to such challenging times, it is essential to continue supporting President Wickremesinghes vision and initiatives. We need to protect the country before our political views. Together, we can build a prosperous future for our country, Semasinghe said.",

        "title": "Defence Secretary assures justice for Sri Lankas disabled war heroes",
        "date": "July 30, 2024 09:12 pm",
        "content": "Secretary to the Ministry of Defence General Kamal Gunaratne (Rtd) announced that the Ministry of Defence has implemented several measures, including allowances, medical rehabilitation, and lifelong care, to ensure justice for all soldiers disabled during the war. He highlighted that over the past two years, the Ministry of Defence has taken numerous steps to stabilize the country both economically and politically, providing a safe and secure environment for the people. General (retired) Kamal Gunaratne made these statements at a news conference titled Two Years of Progress and Way Forward. He emphasized that the Ministry of Defence, guided by the vision of a peaceful land where everyone is protected, has been instrumental in these advancements,said Presidents Media Division. Addressing the media briefing Gen. Gunaratne said, It must be noted that the Ministry of Defence plays a leading role in preventing human trafficking and illegal drug trafficking. The three armed forces, including the Navy, have been pivotal in combating the drug menace, which has received significant attention recently, through the arrest of drug traffickers and the seizure of narcotics. In 2023 alone, the tri-forces operations resulted in the seizure of nearly 560 kg of heroin, 3350 kg of cannabis, 5220 kg of Kerala cannabis, 60 kg of crystal methamphetamine, 151,000 drug capsules, and 6650 litres of illicit liquor. By July 2024, approximately 270 kg of heroin, 3640 kg of cannabis, 12,720 kg of Kerala cannabis, 150 kg of crystal methamphetamine, 43,600 drug capsules, and 5000 litres of illicit liquor had been seized. The contribution of the armed forces in ending the Thirty Year War remains unforgettable. In addition to honouring the fallen war heroes, we must protect those who survived but were injured. Among the 60,000 war heroes wounded in the war, approximately 10,000 are bed-ridden or confined to wheelchairs. Rehabilitation centres have been established in Attidiya, Anuradhapura, Kamburupitiya, and Kurunegala to provide medical rehabilitation and lifelong care for these war heroes. Additionally, the dependents of military personnel who died before the age of 55 while serving the country, as well as those who retired due to medical reasons, will receive a fixed monthly allowance equivalent to the salary and allowances those individuals were receiving while they were alive. This measure ensures that justice is served for all soldiers disabled during the war. Rakna Arakshaka Lanka Ltd has provided re-employment opportunities to over 3,000 soldiers retiring from military service. Given the current situation in the Red Sea, there is now an opportunity to deploy 550 Sea Marshals, and recruitment for these positions is currently underway. Furthermore, the quality of educational facilities at Sir John Kotelawala Defence University has been significantly enhanced, allowing more students to pursue their education. The recruitment of civilian medical students has also commenced. It is noteworthy that more than 1,000 out-patients receive free treatment daily at the Kotelawala Defence University Hospital, which was established for the clinical training of medical students. It must be noted that the recruitment of medical students to Sir John Kotelawala Defence University is conducted solely on the basis of the Z score recommended by the University Grants Commission, and only highly skilled, professional, and accomplished professors have been appointed as lecturers. I would also like to mention that since 2012 to date 286 foreign students have been enrolled at Sir John Kotelawala Defence University due to its high standard of education. Additionally, the United Nations has made the necessary arrangements to resume the peacekeeping missions that had been suspended. So far, a contingent of 301 troops has been deployed for peacekeeping duties in Lebanon, South Sudan, and the Central African Republic. Furthermore, the National Task Force Against Human Trafficking operates under my chairmanship. This task force has taken all necessary steps to combat human trafficking in Sri Lanka, enabling the country to maintain the US State Departments Tier 2 status for three consecutive years. Furthermore, measures have been taken to address the issue of Sri Lankans being forcibly held in Myanmar and exploited in online scams. Our focus has been on rescuing these individuals, which has recently gained significant attention. Consequently, we successfully rescued 40 individuals and brought them back to Sri Lanka. However, another group of people has travelled to this area through brokers in Dubai, and 54 more individuals remain to be rescued. In this regard, I have discussed the matter with the Prime Minister and the National Defence Secretary of Myanmar. Diplomatic requests and appeals were made, both officially and as a former military officer, to secure their release. The Defence Secretary of Myanmar has informed me that the Prime Minister has advised to intervene and take all necessary steps to address this issue. Additionally, there is a concern regarding former military personnel caught in the Ukraine-Russia conflict. We are collaborating with the Ministry of Defence of Russia on this matter. We have also requested the Russian Embassy to notify the Ministry of Defence if any ex-military personnel have applied for tourist visas to Russia. In addition to this, the Ministry of Defence also oversees disaster management activities in the country. The National Building Research Organization (NBRO) serves as the National Centre for Landslide Risk Management under the Disaster Management Division of the Ministry of Defence. Currently, NBRO is identifying and monitoring landslide-prone areas in Sri Lanka, issuing early warnings, and conducting mitigation activities. The Landslide Risk Reduction through Stabilization Techniques project, implemented by NBRO with financial support from the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), is working on stabilizing 128 landslide sites. So far, stabilization has been completed at 46 of these sites. Furthermore, the three armed forces are providing labour for various religious shrines and school renovations across the country upon request and will continue to do so in the future. They are also actively involved in disaster response, including immediate actions to reduce the impact of natural disasters, rescuing affected individuals, providing relief, preparing for disaster situations, implementing mitigation strategies, and resettling displaced persons. They identify vulnerable areas and evacuate people to minimise loss of life, though property damage. Meanwhile, at the request of the Ministry of Health, the Army is providing labour for the construction of a ten-storey building at Matara Hospital, and the Navy is contributing labour for the construction of a ten-storey building at the Lady Ridgeway Childrens Hospital. Additionally, the six-storey building of the Maharagama Apeksha Hospital, constructed with the labour contribution of the Air Force, is almost complete and is scheduled to be commissioned next week. Deputy Vice-Chancellor of Sir John Kotelawala Defence University, Major General C.A. Wickramasinghe, Defence Ministry Senior Assistant Secretary A.M.C.W.P. Abeykoon, and several other officials participated in this event. --PMD--",

        "title": "Iranian president sworn in with chants of Death to America, Israel",
        "date": "July 30, 2024 09:38 pm",
        "content": "Irans new president Masoud Pezeshkian was sworn in on Tuesday, after winning an election earlier this month by promising to improve ties with the world and ease restrictions on social freedoms at home. We will pursue constructive and effective interaction with the world based on dignity, wisdom, and expediency, Pezeshkian, a relative moderate, told a parliament session attended by foreign dignitaries and broadcast live on state television. His victory has lifted hopes of a thaw in Irans antagonistic relations with the West that might create openings for defusing its nuclear standoff with world powers. But Pezeshkian takes office at a time of escalating Middle East tensions over Israels conflict with Hamas in Gaza and cross-border fighting with Irans ally Hezbollah in Lebanon. Iran, which backs the groups which describe themselves as the Axis of Resistance to Israel and U.S. influence in the Middle East, has accused the United States of supporting what it calls Israeli crimes in Gaza. Those who supply weapons that kill children cannot teach Muslims about humanity, Pezeshkian said to chants of Death to America, and Death to Israel. Leaders of Irans Palestinian allies Hamas and the Islamic Jihad as well as senior representatives of Yemens Tehran-backed Houthi movement and Lebanons Hezbollah attended the ceremony. Pezeshkian, who is expected to name his cabinet within two weeks, replaces hardline Ebrahim Raisi, who was killed in a helicopter crash in May. As the ultimate authority in Iran, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has the final say in all state matters, including foreign and nuclear policy. He must also approve Pezeshkians selections for key cabinet posts, such as the foreign, oil and intelligence ministers. As well as mounting pressure from the West over Tehrans fast-advancing nuclear programme, Pezeshkian faces the huge task of breaking Iran free of the crippling U.S. sanctions, reimposed after Washington ditched Irans 2015 nuclear deal with major powers. Indirect talks between Tehran and Washington to salvage the nuclear accord with six major powers have stalled since 2022, with both sides accusing the other of unreasonable demands. My government will never succumb to bullying and pressure ... Pressure and sanctions do not work ... and the Iranian people should be spoken to with respect, said Pezeshkian.

        "content": "Nearly 1,000 people have been rescued after landslides in the hills of Wayanad district in Indias Kerala state, authorities said on Wednesday, with at least 151 people dead and many still missing. Heavy rain in one of Indias most attractive tourist destinations collapsed hillsides early on Tuesday sending torrents of mud, water and tumbling boulders through tea and cardamom estates and small settlements. It was the worst disaster in the state since deadly floods in 2018. At least 151 people died and 187 were still missing, the state chief ministers spokesman, P.M. Manoj, told Reuters by phone. The Indian Army said it rescued 1,000 people and has begun the process to construct an alternate bridge after the main bridge linking the affected area to the nearest town of Chooralmala was destroyed. Nearly 350 of the 400 registered houses in the affected region have been damaged, Asianet TV reported, citing district officials. After a day of extremely heavy rainfall that hampered rescue operations, the weather department expects some respite on Wednesday, although the area is likely to receive rain through the day. The landslides happened at the top and then affected the lower valley areas where people were staying. Focus right now is to search the entire uphill area for stranded people and recover as many bodies (as possible), M R Ajith Kumar, a state law and order official, told Reuters.

He said that instead of the current system, where a contractor and an administrator are assigned to each road, the new parking management system will focus on assigning one contractor for each designated zone. Furthermore, this new system is expected to be implemented within three months and it aims to improve convenience for drivers who use parking spaces within a specific zone. Kularathna further stated that under the current system, a parking ticket cannot be reused within the same zone for short-term parking whereas the new system is expected to enhance the convenience of the drivers by allowing them to park the vehicles in two or three places within an hour in the respective zone using the same parking ticket. He also stated that advanced technologies are expected to be used in the future to enhance vehicle parking services.",

        "date": "July 31, 2024 02:14 pm",
        "content": "A group of 116 former Provincial Council members from the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) and the United National Party (UNP) have pledged their commitment to support President Ranil Wickremesinghes victory in the upcoming presidential election, the PMD reported. Addressing the meeting, President Wickremesinghe declared his candidacy as an independent candidate in this years presidential election pledging his commitment to advancing the country with a bold new vision and an impartial programme aiming to drive development through nine Provincial Governments and the Central Government. President Ranil Wickremesinghe announced his candidacy as an independent in the upcoming presidential election, emphasizing his commitment to advancing the country with a fresh vision and unbiased program. He plans to delegate responsibilities to all 10 governing bodies, including the 9 provincial governments and the central government, to carry out his initiatives. He made these remarks during a meeting at the Waters Edge Hotel, Battaramulla with former Provincial Council representatives from the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) and the United National Party (UNP). Former Chief Minister of the Western Province, Isuru Devapriya, proposed that President Ranil Wickremesinghes victory in the upcoming presidential election should be regarded as a significant achievement. This proposal was supported by 116 former provincial council representatives, including T.M.R. Siripala, who affirmed it with their endorsement. The President further emphasized the importance of safeguarding and advancing the countrys growing economy. He asserted that the agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) must remain intact; highlighting that it is everyones responsibility to continue working toward economic progress, even during elections. Additionally, President Wickremesinghe strongly condemned the killing of Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh and urged the government to take necessary measures to mitigate potential economic impacts arising from developments in Iran, the Middle East, and other regions. He assured that these precautions would be implemented. President Wickremesinghe further said: I thank everyone who has spoken on my behalf and come here to support me. We all came together in July 2022, a time when we lost our homes and many believed the country had no future. Some doubted whether it was possible to move the country forward and questioned why I took over this government. I told them I believed in the countrys potential for recovery. When asked about the experience of the SLPP members, I said that I cant create new people unless I work with the existing ones, so we should continue this journey. Now, they say that I have a strong team. Together with ministers, MPs, provincial councils, and local bodies, we first established stability in the country. There was great fear back then, with MPs being attacked in the streets, and we faced a dire situation. We have now taken steps to return the country to normalcy and free it from bankruptcy. Our work cannot end here. We must adhere to the IMF agreement, as breaking it would send us back into crisis. They provide us with financial support under specific terms, which we have accepted and must follow. Currently, we have funds available only until December. We need to sign another agreement with the IMF in January to receive funds by January or February. If we start renegotiating now, it could take about a year to finalize, and we cannot continue without funding. Therefore, we must decide to accept the funds and proceed with the program. Additionally, we need to address the challenges faced by young people by creating job opportunities, eliminating poverty, and developing the country. To achieve these goals, I am establishing 10 governments: 9 provincial governments and the central government, each with specific responsibilities. I am running for the presidential election as an independent candidate because the country needs a fresh perspective and a new, unbiased program to move forward. Lets embark on this journey together and advance collectively. In 2022, the majority of the SLPP decided to support me, a decision that was crucial for the countrys current situation. I especially thank former President Mahinda Rajapaksa for making that decision, which helped save the country. Now, we need to move forward without dividing parties, preserving them as much as possible. There are significant global issues today. The killing of the Hamas leader in Tehran this morning is something I strongly condemn. It was wrong and could have prevented a solution to the Gaza conflict. This action is likely to escalate problems in the Middle East again, which I do not support. As a nation, we must always uphold the right to life. This international issue has led to other challenges. If a war breaks out, what will happen to fuel prices? If any issues arise, we might need to bring back everyone in the Middle East to Sri Lanka, similar to what we faced when Kuwait was invaded in 1991. This would result in a loss of revenue for the country, making it difficult for the emerging Sri Lanka to handle such a situation. I instructed the foreign minister to engage with their counterparts from other countries to discuss a joint program to manage this situation. Our focus should be on these activities. Our speaker is currently in Tehran, and we are working to bring him back as soon as possible. We must prepare for this situation now. To this end, a committee has been established under the leadership of the Prime Minister, the Foreign Minister, the Minister of Power and Energy, and the Minister of Labour and Foreign Employment. Additionally, a committee composed of officials from the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Power and Energy, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has been appointed under the chairmanship of the National Security Adviser to assess the potential economic consequences. The government is taking proactive measures to address any situation that may arise. There is no benefit in merely shouting from the stage; we must protect the economy and move forward. International agreements cannot be abandoned; they must be upheld and advanced. Even if elections are held, it is our responsibility to continue this work. Provincial council elections are scheduled to take place after the parliamentary elections. I hope to conduct these elections under the 1988 system. I discussed this with MP Sumanthiran yesterday, and he is in agreement. We need to ensure greater representation of women and youth in these elections. Additionally, a Member of Parliament can run for a position in the Provincial Councils while retaining their current role. We must all work together as a government. In addition to the President and Prime Minister, there is a committee of chief finance ministers under the government. We are also proposing the creation of a Rajya Sabha, which would include the President, Prime Minister, party leaders, and chief ministers. As of 2017, the Chief Ministers of seven provinces are working according to the recommendations from the Constitutional Council report. The Tamil parties have also expressed their support. We have agreed to discuss police powers at a later stage, but we will proceed with the implementation of these activities now. There are significant areas of work, such as agriculture modernization, school education, and tourism responsibilities that should be entrusted to the provincial councils. We are committed to preparing for these changes and advancing the country with these 10 governing bodies. --PMD",

        "title": "Protesters clash with UK police after knife attack that killed three girls",
        "date": "July 31, 2024 05:49 pm",
        "content": "Violent clashes broke out on Tuesday in the northern England town where a mass stabbing at a Taylor Swift-themed dance event claimed the lives of three children. Around 100 protesters battled police and lit fires, with thick plumes of smoke rising above the front line, according to an AFP reporter at the scene. Videos circulating on social media appeared to show a police van on fire and protesters pelting police with missiles, with a local mosque the apparent target. Police have said they are not treating Mondays attack as terror-related, but have not released any details of the suspected attacker other than that he is 17 years old and originally from Wales. Merseyside Police said an officer suffered a suspected broken nose in the clashes, and that the protesters were believed to be supporters of the right-wing English Defence League. Officers who are deployed are currently dealing with criminal behaviour and violence with bottles and wheelie bins being thrown at them, added the force. The violence broke out shortly after a vigil was held in the town centre, where hundreds fell silent in tribute to the victims and in a show of support for those affected. Prime Minister Keir Starmer earlier visited the town, saying the tragedy touches a nerve with the whole country. He was among a stream of people to pay tribute at the site of the attack that left five children and two adults with critical wounds. Three other children were hurt. Laying flowers with hundreds of other wreaths, Starmer thanked emergency workers who responded to the stabbing spree and said: I came here to pay my respects to the victims and families who are going through raw pain and grief that most of us cant imagine -- I cant imagine, as a dad myself. However, he was heckled by a handful of by-standers as he laid flowers, with one man shouting: How many more people will die on our streets, prime minister? Town in mourning Nine-year-old Alice Dasilva Aguiar died in hospital early Tuesday, police said. Bebe King aged six and Elsie Dot Stancombe aged seven were the two who died Monday. Police said the two wounded adults had been trying to protect the children. Tributes have already been paid to the bravery of dance and yoga teacher Leanne Lucas, who was among the victims. US pop star Swift said she was completely in shock over the loss of life and innocence, and the horrendous trauma inflicted on everyone. These were just little kids at a dance class. I am at a complete loss for how to ever convey my sympathies to these families, she added on Instagram. Aguiar was the daughter of Portuguese parents from Madeira. Her parents are in a state of shock, Portugals communities minister Jose Cesario told AFP. Her family said in a tribute, keep smiling and dancing like you love to do our princess, like we said before to you, youre always our princess and no one would change that. Bebe Kings family said, no words can describe the devastation that has hit our family as try to deal with the loss of our little girl Bebe. Residents of the seaside town said they were struggling to come to terms with the deaths. The town is in shock and in mourning, local MP Patrick Hurley told AFP, calling it the most horrific atrocity that Southport has experienced in living memory. It is a very small town, a close-knit community and everybody will be intimately affected by this, he added. I just cannot believe that it happened so close to home, resident Leanne Hassan told reporters. Local business owner Colin Parry recounted to UK media how he saw about 10 kids go running past him, all bleeding. One of them collapsed on the floor outside the neighbour next door, he told the Press Association news agency. Utterly horrific The teenager arrested on suspicion of murder and attempted murder is from the neighbouring village of Banks but was born in Cardiff, according to police. Police said a name shared on social media was incorrect and we would urge people not to speculate on details of the incident while the investigation is ongoing. Witnesses told UK media the attacker arrived at the scene in a taxi on Monday morning and entered the venue wearing a mask. Armed officers detained the suspect later and seized a knife. While such attacks are rare, Mondays incident evoked memories of a school massacre in the Scottish town of Dunblane in 1996, which claimed the lives of 16 pupils and their teacher in Britains worst mass shooting. King Charles III offered his most heartfelt condolences, prayers and deepest sympathies following the utterly horrific incident. Source: AFP --Agencies",

        "date": "August 1, 2024 12:46 pm",
        "content": "Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh was assassinated in the Iranian capital Tehran early on Wednesday morning, an attack that drew threats of revenge on Israel and fuelled further concern that the conflict in Gaza was turning into a wider Middle East war. The Palestinian Islamist militant group and Irans Revolutionary Guards confirmed Haniyehs death. The Guards said it took place hours after he attended a swearing-in ceremony for Irans new president. Although the strike on Haniyeh was widely assumed to have been carried out by Israel, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahus government made no claim of responsibility and said it would make no comment on the killing. Haniyeh was killed by a missile that hit him directly in a state guesthouse where he was staying, senior Hamas official Khalil Al-Hayya told a news conference in Tehran, quoting witnesses who were with Haniyeh. Haniyeh, normally based in Qatar, had been the face of Hamas international diplomacy as the war set off by the Hamas-led attack on Israel on Oct. 7 has raged in Gaza. He had been taking part in internationally brokered indirect talks on reaching a ceasefire in the Palestinian enclave. Netanyahu made no mention of Haniyehs killing in a televised statement on Wednesday evening but said Israel had delivered crushing blows to Irans proxies of late, including Hamas and Hezbollah, and would respond forcefully to any attack. We are prepared for any scenario and we will stand united and determined against any threat. Israel will exact a heavy price for any aggression against us from any arena, he said. The latest events appear to set back chances of any imminent ceasefire agreement in the nearly 10-month-old war in Gaza between Israel and the Iran-backed Hamas. Hamas armed wing said in a statement Haniyehs killing would take the battle to new dimensions and have major repercussions. Vowing to retaliate, Iran declared three days of national mourning and said the U.S. bore responsibility because of its support for Israel. In Turkey, thousands of pro-Palestinian demonstrators marched through the streets of central Istanbul late on Wednesday to protest Haniyehs killing. Protesters in Istanbuls Fatih district held posters with Haniyehs photo, chanted murderer Israel, get out of Palestine and waved Turkish and Palestinian flags. Washington expressed concern about the potential for escalation. But White House national security spokesperson John Kirby said the U.S. did not see that as imminent or inevitable and was working to prevent it from happening. The risks are certainly up right now. They dont make the task of de-escalation, deterrence and dissuasion - which is the goal - any less complicated, he told reporters. The U.S. advised citizens not to travel to Lebanon, and two U.S. airlines, United and Delta, paused flights to Tel Aviv. The assassination occurred less than 24 hours after Israel said it had killed Hezbollahs most senior military commander in retaliation for a deadly rocket strike in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights. Hezbollah confirmed that senior military commander Fuad Shukr was killed by an Israeli airstrike in a Beirut suburb. Seven people were killed and 78 wounded in the Beirut strike, Lebanese network Tele Liban reported on Wednesday, citing the civil defence authority. Iranian state media said an Iranian military adviser was among the dead. ISRAEL INVITES HARSH PUNISHMENT, KHAMENEI SAYS Irans Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said Israel had provided the grounds for harsh punishment for itself and it was Tehrans duty to avenge Haniyehs death. Iranian forces have already made strikes directly on Israel earlier in the Gaza war. Haniyehs most likely successor is Khaled Meshaal, his deputy-in-exile who lives in Qatar, analysts and Hamas officials said. Israeli government spokesperson David Mencer told journalists that Israel was committed to Gaza ceasefire negotiations and securing the release of Israeli hostages held by Palestinian militants in Gaza. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, in Singapore, sidestepped a question on Haniyehs killing, saying a ceasefire deal in Gaza was key to avoiding wider regional escalation. He told Channel News Asia that the U.S. had neither been aware of nor involved in the killing. Qatar, which along with Egypt has been brokering talks aimed at halting the fighting in Gaza, condemned Haniyehs killing. How can mediation succeed when one party assassinates the negotiator on other side? Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani said on X. In Washington, Kirby said the ceasefire process had not been completely torpedoed, adding that we still believe the deal on the table is worth pursuing. Israel launched its offensive in Gaza after Hamas-led fighters on Oct. 7 killed about 1,200 people in southern Israel and took some 250 hostages, Israeli tallies say. Nearly 10 months of Israels onslaught in the coastal enclave has killed more than 39,400 people, according to Gaza health officials, and left more than 2 million in a humanitarian crisis. While the mood was buoyant in Israel, residents in besieged Gaza feared Haniyehs death would prolong the fighting. This news is scary. We feel that he was like a father to us, said Gaza resident Hachem Al-Saati. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "title": "India officially protests death of fisherman in Sri Lankan waters",
        "date": "August 1, 2024 01:33 pm",
        "content": "India on Thursday (01) lodged a strong protest with Sri Lanka over an alleged collision between a Sri Lankan naval vessel and an Indian fishing boat that killed a fisherman and left another missing. The Indias Ministry of External Affairs has called in Sri Lankas Acting High Commissioner to India Priyanga Wickremesinghe, on Thursday morning to register a protest over the incident, the Indian External Affairs Ministry said in a statement. The incident comes in the wake of a Sri Lankan Navy personnel being killed during an operation to seize an Indian fishing boat in July. The collision was reported early on Thursday morning between a Sri Lankan naval vessel and an Indian fishing boat at a location five nautical miles north of Katchatheevu island. Out of the four Indian fishermen who were on board the vessel, one unfortunately lost his life, and another is missing, the statement said. Two of the fishermen were rescued and brought ashore to Kankesanthurai. A search is underway for the missing Indian fisherman. Officials of the Indian consulate in Jaffna were directed to go to Kankesanthurai and extend all possible assistance to the fishermen and their families. The Sri Lankan Acting High Commissioner in New Delhi was called in today morning to the Ministry of External Affairs and a strong protest was registered over the incident. We expressed our shock and anguish at the unfortunate loss of life, the statement said. Indias High Commissioner in Colombo, Santosh Jha, would also raise the matter with the Sri Lankan government later on Thursday, the statement added. The Indian government has always emphasised the need to deal with issues pertaining to fishermen in a humane and humanitarian manner, it highlighted. Existing understandings between the two governments in that regard must be strictly observed. Utmost efforts should be made to ensure that there is no recurrence or resort to the use of force, it added. The Indian government said it attaches the highest priority to the safety and security of Indian fishermen, and issues related to them have been raised regularly at the highest levels with the Sri Lankan leadership. However, issuing a media release, Sri Lanka Navy stated that the incident took place after the Indian fishing boat which was illegally poaching in Sri Lankan waters capsized during an interception attempt. Dozens of Indian and Sri Lankan fishermen are arrested by the two countries each year on charges of violating the maritime boundary or illegal fishing. Government of India has always emphasised the need to deal with issues pertaining to fishermen in a humane and humanitarian manner, it added. Indias MEA said that the existing understandings between the two governments must be strictly upheld. It said there is a need for the utmost efforts to prevent any recurrence or use of force. Government attaches the highest priority to the safety and security of Indian fishermen, it said, adding that it has raised the issue multiple times with Sri Lanka at the highest levels. During a recent visit to India, Sri Lankas State Minister of Foreign Affairs Tharaka Balasuriya also stressed the need to hold a discussion on the fishermen issue between Sri Lanka and India, emphasizing that both countries must look into this long-lasting issue from a sustainable perspective. --With inputs from agencies",

        "title": "Many top swimmers are going slower than expected in the Olympic pool. Is it too shallow?",
        "date": "August 1, 2024 01:42 pm",
        "content": "The atmosphere for Olympic swimming is electrifying. Through the first four days of competition in the portable pool at La Defense Arena, no world records were set. That finally changed in the final race Wednesday night when Pan Zhanle of China broke his own mark in the mens 100-meter freestyle. Still, most of the best swimmers in the world are clocking slower-than-expected times. The culprit appears to be a pool that is slightly shallower than the optimal depth, which allows a couple of extra rows of prime deck-side seats to remain in use but creates more waves and turbulence rolling up to the surface. Ive heard the rumblings, but at the end of the day were here to race, said American star Katie Ledecky, who picked up her first gold medal of the Games with a dominating win in the 1,500 freestyle. Were all fast swimmers. We make the pool as fast as we want it to be. Im not really thinking about it. Going forward, World Aquatics has mandated a minimum depth of 2.5 meters (8.2 feet) for swimming and water polo events, such as the portable pool that will be installed inside SoFi Stadium for the 2028 Los Angeles Games. But when the Olympics were awarded to Paris, the temporary facility was approved under previous guidelines that allowed for a depth of 2.2 meters (7.2 feet). For perspective, a 3-meter (9.8 feet) pool is considered the optimal depth. At the U.S. trials in Indianapolis, where the portable pool installed in Lucas Oil Stadium was around 2.8 meters (9.1 feet), two world records were set. Torin Koos, a spokesman for World Aquatics, noted that numerous Olympic records have been set  nine through the first 20 events at La Defense Arena. Indeed, no one is griping much. Everyone is competing under the same conditions, so its not like anyone has an advantage. For the most part, the favored swimmers are coming out on top. I try not to pay attention to it just because were all in the same pool, said American Katie Grimes, who claimed a silver in the 400-meter individual medley. I mean, regardless if its a slow pool or not, its not going to affect just one person. Its affecting everybody. Everyone has raved about the raucous setting, more than 15,000 strong for every session in an indoor stadium that is normally used by the famed rugby club Racing 92. The crowds are loud and boisterous, especially when French star Leon Marchand dives in the water. It doesnt matter whether Im racing here in in Paris or at a local country pool in South Australia, Aussie sprinter Kyle Chalmers said. Its all about winning that race in the pool. Everyone has the same opportunity. Everyone has a lane. Were all swimming in the same pool. Its not like some people are sending their times in from the trials or anything like that. Chalmers doesnt believe the pool is entirely to blame for the slower-than-expected races. Theres a lot of pressure and expectation that people put on themselves, he said. A lot of people havent swam in the Olympics before. I think the nervous energy of having like (15,000 fans) in the stadium is crazy. I personally love it, but I think people do definitely crack under that pressure. Still, the times are a bit jarring. Summer McIntosh blew away Grimes and the rest of the field in the 400 IM, but the 17-year-old Canadian went more than three seconds slower than her world-record showing at her countrys Olympic trials in May. David Popovici of Romania captured gold in the mens 200 freestyle with a time of 1 minute, 44.72 seconds, the slowest by an Olympic champion in that event since Pieter van den Hoogenband at the 2000 Sydney Games. Then theres Nicolò Martinenghi of Italy, whose gold-medal time of 59.03 in the 100 breaststroke would not have been good enough to claim a medal of any color at the last two Summer Games. It was the slowest winning performance since Japans Kosuke Kitajima two decades ago at the Athens Olympics. At least one swimming world record has been set at every Olympics in the post-World War II era, and its common for multiple marks to fall. A whopping 23 world records were set at the 2008 Beijing Games, when the sport was in the midst of the rubber-suit revolution. The following year, at the world championships in Rome, a staggering 43 marks were established, leading the world governing body to impose strict new rules governing body coverage and fabrics. Since then, the pace of world records has returned to more customary levels, with several marks from those 2009 worlds still on the books. But its generally assumed that most everyone will be at their best when an Olympic year rolls around, which usually leads to a spirited assault on the record list. Nine world records were set at London in 2012, eight more fell at the 2016 Games in Rio de Janeiro and a half-dozen were broken at the pandemic-delayed Tokyo Games three years ago, when swimmers competed in a mostly empty arena because of COVID-19 restrictions. The lack of fans hasnt been an issue in Paris, where the cacophony of a large arena filled to the rafters with passionate supporters has given everyone an extra push. Not quite enough to call for a rewrite to the record book, but Chalmers and others dont really seem to mind. It doesnt matter about times, the Aussie said. Its about getting your hand on the wall first and winning the race. The times are never really all that remembered. Source: ABC News --Agencies",

        "date": "August 1, 2024 02:37 pm",
        "content": "Israels military says it killed Hamas military chief Mohammed Deif in an air strike in Gaza on 13 July. Deif was targeted in an Israeli strike on a compound in the Khan Younis area. Hamas is yet to confirm his death. Israel says Deif was one of the figures responsible for the planning of the 7 October attacks in southern Israel in which 1,200 people were killed. Israels announcement comes after the assassination of Hamas political leader Ismael Haniyeh, who was killed in Tehran, and senior Hezbollah commander Fuad Shukr, who was killed in an Israeli air strike on the Lebanese capital, Beirut. Mohammed Deif was head of the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades, the military arm of the Hamas movement. He was imprisoned by Israeli authorities in 1989, after which he formed the Brigades with the aim of capturing Israeli soldiers. Israel accused him of planning and supervising bus bombings which killed tens of Israelis in 1996, and of involvement in the capture and killing of three Israeli soldiers in the mid-1990s. He is also known to have helped engineer the construction of tunnels that have allowed Hamas fighters to get inside Israel from Gaza. Source: BBC --Agencies",

        "date": "August 1, 2024 04:49 pm",
        "content": "CrowdStrike has been sued by shareholders who said the cybersecurity company defrauded them by concealing how its inadequate software testing could cause the July 19 global outage that crashed more than 8 million computers. In a proposed class action filed on Tuesday night in the Austin, Texas federal court, shareholders said they learned that CrowdStrikes assurances about its technology were materially false and misleading when a flawed software update disrupted airlines, banks, hospitals and emergency lines around the world. They said CrowdStrikes share price fell 32 over the next 12 days, wiping out 25 billion of market value, as the outages effects became known, Chief Executive George Kurtz was called to testify to the U.S. Congress, and Delta Air Lines reportedly hired prominent lawyer David Boies to seek damages. The complaint cites statements including from a March 5 conference call where Kurtz characterized CrowdStrikes software as validated, tested and certified. In a statement on Wednesday, Austin-based CrowdStrike said: We believe this case lacks merit and we will vigorously defend the company, Kurtz and Chief Financial Officer Burt Podbere are also defendants. The lawsuit led by the Plymouth County Retirement Association of Plymouth, Massachusetts, seeks unspecified damages for holders of CrowdStrike Class A shares between Nov. 29, 2023 and July 29, 2024. Shareholders often sue companies after unexpected negative news causes stock prices to fall, and CrowdStrike could face more lawsuits. Delta Chief Executive Ed Bastian told CNBC on Wednesday that the outage cost his airline 500 million, including lost revenue and compensation and hotels for stranded fliers. CrowdStrike shares closed on Wednesday down 1.69 at 231.96. They closed at 343.05 on the day before the outage. The case is Plymouth County Retirement Association v CrowdStrike Inc et al, U.S. District Court, Western District of Texas, No. 24-00857. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

He was asked whether the government has taken any action with regard to Tamil Nadu Chief Ministers letter dated July 11, 2024 requesting the release of 80 fishermen and 173 fishing boats detained by Sri Lankan Navy and details there of. As per the available information, Indian fishermen are apprehended for allegedly crossing International Maritime Boundary Line (IMBL) and fishing in Sri Lankan waters.

In addition, our consular officials meet the detained fishermen regularly and provide all necessary support including legal assistance to the apprehended fishermen. Our officials are working for the early release and repatriation of these fishermen, the minister of state for external affairs said in the response.

        "date": "August 2, 2024 09:12 am",
        "content": "Minister of Foreign Affairs Ali Sabry said that President Ranil Wickremesinghes decision to set up three special committees as a proactive measure to address potential crises in the Middle East is highly timely. The Minister highlighted that while international events are uncontrollable; waiting for a country to collapse is not an option. He assured that steps have been taken to handle any emerging situation. Minister Ali Sabry made these remarks at a press conference yesterday (01) at the Presidential Media Center, themed Collective Path to a Stable Country. He underscored that President Wickremesinghes forward-thinking decisions have ensured Sri Lankas economic stability, preventing it from becoming another Venezuela. He urged everyone to set aside party politics and support the Presidents efforts to rebuild the country, according to the Presidents, Media Division. Minister Ali Sabry further stated; Over the past two years, our country has faced numerous international challenges. The initial challenge was securing the support of our creditor nations, including the Paris Club, for joining the International Monetary Fund (IMF) programme. Coordinating with various countries proved to be a complex task, but we successfully garnered their support for debt restructuringa significant achievement in our foreign policy. This success is largely due to President Ranil Wickremesinghes expertise in managing international relations. Recent visits to Japan, Singapore, Romania, and Poland have also been highly successful. These trips addressed many longstanding issues and facilitated the resumption of 13 suspended projects by Japan, worth 1.1 billion. Additionally, discussions with Singapore focused on investments, while talks with Romania aimed at creating new job opportunities. We also engaged in discussions with Poland regarding the establishment of an embassy. These accomplishments are a testament to President Wickremesinghes visionary leadership. His ability to navigate both Eastern and Western nations effectively has been instrumental in achieving these outcomes. Foreignpolicy.com, a prestigious magazine on international diplomacy, has praised Sri Lanka for its effective management of foreign policy. This endorsement confirms that our strategic approach has led to significant successes for the country. In response to potential crises in the Middle East, President Ranil Wickremesinghe has appointed three special committees as a proactive measure. One committee focuses on national security, another on the economic situation and ensuring the availability of essential goods, and a third, chaired by the President and Prime Minister, oversees the work of the other two. The fuel crisis of 2022, exacerbated by the Russian-Ukrainian war, led to sharp increases in fuel, coal, and wheat prices, which the country struggled to manage. In light of these challenges, the Presidents decision to establish these committees represents a timely and prudent step to prevent a recurrence of such crises. We convened to develop a programme aimed at stabilising the countrys energy sector and ensuring an uninterrupted supply of essential goods. While some situations are within a countrys control, international events are not. However, we should not wait for external factors to cause a collapse. Over the past two years, President Ranil Wickremesinghe has demonstrated his capability to stabilise Sri Lanka without allowing it to become another Venezuela. We are therefore gratified by our decision in 2022 to support President Wickremesinghe in navigating the country through its crisis. Although we have moved from a dire situation to a level of stability, we are still at a precarious stage. Even a small misstep could lead us back into severe difficulties. The opposition must decide whether to further destabilise the country or contribute to its recovery. It is crucial for everyone to set aside party politics and support President Wickremesinghes economic programme to build a robust economy. --PMD--",

        "content": "The United States on Thursday recognized Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduros opponent and opposition candidate Edmundo Gonzalez as the winner of Venezuelas disputed presidential election, rejecting Maduros claim of victory. Given the overwhelming evidence, it is clear to the United States and, most importantly, to the Venezuelan people that Edmundo Gonzalez Urrutia won the most votes in Venezuelas July 28 presidential election, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, opens new tab said in a statement on Thursday. The announcement from Washington did not go beyond congratulating him for a successful campaign, the closest the U.S. has come since Sundays contested election to recognizing Gonzalez as the OPEC nations new leader. The dispute over the presidential election results has sparked protests in Venezuela. Venezuelas electoral council proclaimed Maduro, who has been in power since 2013, the winner of the July 28 election with 51 of the vote. But the countrys opposition says its tally of about 90 of the votes shows that Gonzalez received more than double the support of the incumbent president, in line with independent polling conducted before the contest. The opposition has released detailed tallies on a public website, while the government has so far not shared any information beyond a national total of votes for each candidate. The statement from Blinken on Thursday stopped short of threatening new sanctions on Venezuela but he hinted at possible punitive action. Reuters reported on Tuesday that Washington was considering fresh sanctions following the disputed election. We fully support the process of re-establishing democratic norms in Venezuela and stand ready to consider ways to bolster it jointly with our international partners, Blinken said. Blinken also urged that opposition leaders be protected and kept safe. Law enforcement and security forces should not become an instrument of political violence used against citizens exercising their democratic rights, he said. The presidents of Brazil, Mexico and Colombia called for Venezuela to release detailed voting tallies on Thursday amid the dispute over presidential election results. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "date": "August 2, 2024 11:20 am",
        "content": "A Sri Lankan mother-of-three killed by her estranged husband fled the family home with her children almost a decade earlier after he hit her with a hammer and stomped on her, a jury has been told. Nelomie Perera, 43, was found dead in a pool of blood in her kitchen with 35 separate injuries in December 2022. Prosecutors allege Dinush Kurera, 47, murdered her in a sustained, brutal and vicious attack with a hatchet and kitchen knife in front of their children. Kurera has pleaded not guilty to her murder and further denies assaulting his 17-year-old son. On Wednesday, lawyers for Kurera, whom prosecutors allege had no injuries after the attack, told a jury that he admitted he killed his wife but he did so to save his own life. He grappled with her over the knife, in her murderous rage and he defended himself and the deceased was killed, defence barrister John Desmond told the court. Rage met rage. Prosecutor Mark Gibson KC had alleged, on the first day of the trial, that Kurera was fuelled by a deep-seated hatred for Perera when he killed her, after she told him she wanted a divorce and he discovered she was seeing other people. He told the court that Perera, 43, had discovered Kurera was cheating on her with another woman while he was on a trip in Sri Lanka and ended their marriage over the phone. She told him he could no longer stay at their family home, organised a storage unit where she moved his belongings and was fearful about his return home to Melbourne, Gibson alleged. About two days after he flew home, on 3 December 2022, Gibson said Kurera went to Bunnings Warehouse and bought a 30cm crowbar and a fibreglass hatchet. At about 10pm, Kurera went to a petrol station and bought a lighter and a 10-litre jerry can which he filled with petrol, the prosecutor said. The court heard that Kurera then drove to the family home in Sandhurst, in Melbournes southeast, used the crowbar to break through the fence while wearing dark clothing and gloves. Mr Kurera, under the cover of darkness, approached Nelomie, taking her by surprise as she was about to have a cigarette on the back patio area, Gibson said. He alleged Kurera then struck his wife in the head with a hatchet and their two teen children ran down to their mothers screams. Gibson said the family then moved to the living room where the estranged couple argued before Kurera again hit Perera with the hatchet. He told the court that the pairs 17-year-old son tried to run for help, but Kurera chased him and hit him with the axe. Desmond said Kurera denies that he hit Perera with the hatchet or assaulted his son. It just didnt happen, the defence barrister said on Wednesday. Gibson alleged in court that Kurera, Perera and their 16-year-old daughter moved to the kitchen, where he grabbed a 30cm long kitchen knife and stabbed her. But Desmond said this was a stark issue for the jury to decide in the trial as Kurera claimed it was Perera who came at him with the knife. Nelomie took the opportunity when it arose to get the kitchen knife and came at the accused in a wild rage, violently swinging this large kitchen knife at the accused, trying to kill him, he said. He did what any person would do and was entitled to do in those circumstances  he defended himself. Pereras sister Minoli gave evidence on Wednesday afternoon, describing an alleged history of violence perpetrated by Kurera. The jury was told Perera fled to her parents home with her three children in 2013 after Kurera allegedly hit her with a hammer and stomped on her. She had bruises on her face and she was struggling to walk, Minoli said. She told me that she couldnt leave Kurera because of the children. She said when Perera caught her husband cheating on her with a woman in Sri Lanka he denied it and said it was all in her head. The trial before justice Amanda Fox continues.

        "content": "Announcing an indefinite strike with immediate effect on Friday, August 2, the members of all fishermen associations in Rameswaram said they would resume work only when their grievances were redressed by the Tamil Nadu and Union governments. An urgent meeting of various fishermen associations was held at Rameswaram under the leadership of Sagayam. The meeting resolved to boycott fishing from today (Friday) until all the arrested fishermen from Tamil Nadu, who languished in Sri Lankan prisons, were released. The members stated that though the governments helped in release of the arrested fishermen in the past, the mechanised trawlers which were impounded, were not returned. Hence, the governments should get back the mechanised boats, which were in good condition and provide compensation to those boats, which were beyond repair. The meeting thanked Tamil Nadu government for immediately providing solatium of 10 lakh to the family members of fisherman K. Malaisamy (59), who had died in mid-sea after the boat was allegedly damaged by the Sri Lankan Navy personnel on Wednesday night. Speaking to media persons, Mr. Sagayam said the Union government should come to the rescue of the fishermen as it involved their livelihood. Thanking the government and the officials for carrying out search operation along the Palk Straits after another fisherman (among the four) went missing, he said that the government should give compensation within about 10 days to the family members irrespective of whether the fisherman was traced or not. The meeting passed a resolution to immediately release the two detained fishermen and appealed to the governments for their safe return. Background Following the death of Malaisamy, there was unrest in the coastal pockets since Thursday. On Wednesday, four Tamil Nadu fishermen had ventured into the sea for fishing activities in a mechanised boat owned by Karthikeyan. As they were fishing near Neduntheevu islet, the surveillance vessel of the Sri Lankan Navy personnel allegedly hit against the fishermens boat in which it was badly damaged. As a result, the four fishermen fell in the sea. During the incident, Malaisamy had died, while V. Ramachandran (64) was said to be missing. The Sri Lankan Navy personnel detained two other fishermen - Mookiah (54) and Muthu Muniandi (57) and took them for interrogation to Kankesanthurai. Source: The Hindu --Agencies",

        "date": "August 2, 2024 02:47 pm",
        "content": "Intel said on Thursday it would cut more than 15 of its workforce, some 17,500 people, and suspend its dividend starting in the fourth quarter as the chipmaker pursues a turnaround focused on its money-losing manufacturing business. It also forecast third-quarter revenue below market estimates, grappling with a pullback in spending on traditional data center semiconductors and a focus on AI chips, where it lags rivals. Shares of Santa Clara, California-based Intel slumped 20 in extended trade, setting the chipmaker up to lose more than 24 billion in market value. The stock had closed down 7 on Thursday, in tandem with a plunge in U.S. chip stocks after a conservative forecast from Arm Holdings on Wednesday. The results did not rock the broader chip industry. AI powerhouse Nvidia and smaller rival AMD ticked up after hours, underscoring how well-positioned they were to take advantage of the AI boom, and Intels relative disadvantage. I need less people at headquarters, more people in the field, supporting customers, CEO Pat Gelsinger told Reuters in an interview, talking about the job cuts. On the dividend suspension, he said: Our objective is to ... pay a competitive dividend over time, but right now, focusing on the balance sheet, deleveraging. Intel, which employed 116,500 people as of June 29, excluding some subsidiaries, said the majority of the job cuts would be completed by the end of 2024. In April, it declared a quarterly dividend of 12.5 cents per share. Intel is in the middle of a turnaround plan, focused on developing advanced AI processors and building-out its for-hire manufacturing capabilities, as it aims to recoup the technological edge it lost to Taiwans TSMC, the worlds largest contract chipmaker. The push to energize that contracting foundry business under Gelsinger has increased Intels costs and pressured profit margins. More recently, the chipmaker has said it will cut costs. On Thursday, Intel announced it would cut operating expenses and reduce capital expenditure by more than 10 billion in 2025, more than it initially planned. A 10 billion cost reduction plan shows that management is willing to take strong and drastic measures to right the ship and fix problems. But we are all asking, is it enough and is it a bit of a late reaction considering that CEO Gelsinger has been at the helm for over three years? said Michael Schulman, chief investment officer of Running Point Capital. The company had cash and cash equivalents of 11.29 billion, and total current liabilities of about 32 billion, as of June 29. Intels lagging position in the market for AI chips has sent its shares down more than 40 so far this year. For the third quarter, Intel expects revenue of 12.5 billion to 13.5 billion, compared with analysts average estimate of 14.35 billion, LSEG data showed. It forecast adjusted gross margin of 38, well short of market expectations of 45.7. CUTTING CAPEX Analysts believe Intels plan to turn around the foundry business will take years to materialize and expect TSMC to maintain its lead in the coming years, even as Intel has ramped up production of AI chips for personal computers. The PC chip business grew 9 in the April-June quarter. The irony is that ... their first AI PC-focused processors are selling much better than expected. The problem is that the costs for those chips are much higher, meaning their profitability on them isnt great, said Bob ODonnell, chief analyst at TECHnalysis Research. In addition, the data center decline reinforces the fact that while companies are buying lots of infrastructure for AI, the vast majority is for non-Intel GPUs, he said, referring to graphic processing units like those sold by Nvidia. Intels data center business declined 3 in the quarter. CFO David Zinsner said on a post-earnings call that the chipmaker expects weaker consumer and enterprise spending in the current quarter, especially in China. Export licenses that were revoked in May also hurt Intels business in China in the second quarter, he said. Intel said in May its sales there would take a hit after Washington revoked some of the chipmakers export licenses for a customer in China. Intel is also slashing investments. It expects to cut capital expenses by 17 in 2025 year-on-year to 21.5 billion, calculated on the midpoint of a range the chipmaker forecast. It expects these costs to stay roughly flat in 2024.

        "title": "Relaxing vehicle import restrictions will support Sri Lankas revenue mobilization in 2025  IMF",
        "date": "August 2, 2024 03:47 pm",
        "content": "The International Monetary Fund (IMF) says the 2025 Budget needs to be underpinned by appropriate revenue measures and continued spending restraint so as to reach the medium-term primary balance objective of 2.3 percent of GDPa key requirement for restoring Sri Lankas debt sustainability. With Sri Lankas knife-edged recovery at a critical juncture, sustaining the reform momentum and ensuring timely implementation of all program commitments are critical to cement the hard-won economic progress to date and put the economy on a firm footing. Maintaining macroeconomic stability and restoring debt sustainability require further efforts to raise fiscal revenues, said IMF Senior Mission Chief for Sri Lanka Peter Breuer. He made this statement in their End-of-Mission press release, which includes statements of IMF staff teams that convey preliminary findings after a visit to a country. An IMF mission team led by Senior Mission Chief Mr. Peter Breuer visited Sri Lanka from July 25 to August 2, 2024, to discuss recent macroeconomic developments and progress in implementing economic and financial policies under the authorities economic reform program supported by the IMFs Extended Fund Facility (EFF) arrangement. The 2025 Budget needs to be underpinned by appropriate revenue measures and continued spending restraint so as to reach the medium-term primary balance objective of 2.3 percent of GDPa key requirement for restoring Sri Lankas debt sustainability. He further stated that the planned relaxation of import restrictions on motor vehicles will support revenue mobilization in 2025. He said that tax administration reforms could further improve compliance, including by establishing a properly functioning VAT refund system for exporters by April 2025. Any proposed measure eroding the fiscal position needs to be offset by compensating measures of high quality, the IMF Senior Mission Chief said. He stated that avoiding new tax exemptions will not only reduce corruption risks and fiscal revenue leakages, but also ensure a more predictable and transparent tax system. Continuing to maintain energy prices at cost-recovery levels is critical to avoid potential fiscal costs, he added. Protecting the poor and the vulnerable through improved targeting and better coverage of cash transfers remains critical. Policy slippages could jeopardize the recovery, he said. At the end of the mission, Mr. Breuer issued the following statement: The economic reform program implemented by the Sri Lankan authorities is yielding commendable outcomes. The recovery continues with real GDP posting three consecutive quarters of expansion, and growth accelerating to 5.3 percent year-on-year in the first quarter of 2024. Inflation remains contained below the Central Bank of Sri Lankas (CBSL) 5 percent target and domestic borrowing rates have declined. Gross international reserves increased by US1.2 billion during the first half of 2024 and reached US5.6 billion. Fiscal revenue collections increased during the same period. Going forward, these improvements need to translate into better living conditions for all of Sri Lankas people. With Sri Lankas knife-edged recovery at a critical juncture, sustaining the reform momentum and ensuring timely implementation of all program commitments are critical to cement the hard-won economic progress to date and put the economy on a firm footing. Maintaining macroeconomic stability and restoring debt sustainability require further efforts to raise fiscal revenues. The 2025 Budget needs to be underpinned by appropriate revenue measures and continued spending restraint so as to reach the medium-term primary balance objective of 2.3 percent of GDPa key requirement for restoring Sri Lankas debt sustainability. The planned relaxation of import restrictions on motor vehicles will support revenue mobilization in 2025. Tax administration reforms could further improve compliance, including by establishing a properly functioning VAT refund system for exporters by April 2025. Any proposed measure eroding the fiscal position needs to be offset by compensating measures of high quality. Avoiding new tax exemptions will not only reduce corruption risks and fiscal revenue leakages, but also ensure a more predictable and transparent tax system. Continuing to maintain energy prices at cost-recovery levels is critical to avoid potential fiscal costs. Protecting the poor and the vulnerable through improved targeting and better coverage of cash transfers remains critical. Policy slippages could jeopardize the recovery. The recent parliamentary approval of two key pieces of legislationthe Public Financial Management Act and the Public Debt Management Actis a milestone that will improve fiscal discipline and prudent debt management, bolstering transparency and accountability. Developing a holistic debt management strategy and establishing a well-structured and integrated Public Debt Management Office will help lower the governments financing risks. Inflation has been well-contained. Monetary policy should remain prudent and prioritize the anchoring of inflation expectations. Maintaining price stability also hinges on safeguarding CBSLs independence. Continued reserve accumulation and exchange rate flexibility remain key priorities. The recent amendments to the Banking Act and the related implementing regulations will help safeguard financial stability. To allow the financial sector to contribute to economic growth, the authorities need to ensure the banking sector is adequately capitalized. The recently formulated National Anti-corruption Agenda, building on the authorities earlier governance action plan, is a welcome step. A steadfast implementation of governance reforms outlined in the Governance Diagnostic Report, prioritizing near-term commitments under the EFF program, is critical to addressing corruption risks and promoting a break from past policy missteps. Ensuring an enabling environment for governance reforms is key to bolstering public confidence and facilitating implementation of these important efforts. The authorities have made commendable progress with putting debt on a path towards sustainability. The execution of the domestic debt restructuring and finalizing the agreements with the Official Creditor Committee and China EXIM Bank are major milestones. IMF staff assessed the Joint Working Framework announced at the conclusion of the second round of restricted discussions with the bondholder committee and have provided this assessment to the authorities and, on their request, the financial advisors of the bondholders. We encourage a swift resolution of the remaining steps to achieve debt sustainability and regain investor confidence. We will continue to support Sri Lankas ongoing debt restructuring efforts. Progress in meeting key commitments under the IMF-supported program will be formally assessed in the context of the third review of the EFF. The timing of the third review will be discussed with the government after the recently announced presidential elections. The IMF team held meetings with President and Finance Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, Central Bank of Sri Lanka Governor Dr. P. Nandalal Weerasinghe, Secretary to the Treasury Mr. K M Mahinda Siriwardana, and other senior government and CBSL officials. The IMF team also met with Parliamentarians, representatives from the private sector, civil society organizations, and development partners. We would like to thank the authorities for the excellent collaboration during the mission and reaffirm our commitment to support Sri Lanka for a full and inclusive economic recovery.",

        "date": "August 2, 2024 03:52 pm",
        "content": "At least 13 protesters were killed during mass protests in Nigeria against the countrys economic crisis that turned violent in several states, a rights group said Friday. Authorities confirmed four people killed by a bomb and the arrests of hundreds in the protests that triggered curfews in several states. Amnesty Internationals Nigeria director Isa Sanusi said in an interview that it independently verified the deaths that were reported by witnesses, families of the victims and lawyers. More than 300 protesters were arrested and curfews imposed in the northern states of Kano and Katsina after the looting of government and public properties, Nigerian police said. One police officer was also killed and several others injured. The protests were mainly over food shortages and alleged bad governance in the country. Nigerias public officials, frequently accused of corruption, are among the best paid in Africa, a stark contrast in a country that has some of the worlds poorest and hungriest people, despite being one of the continents top oil producers. Carrying placards, bells and Nigerias green-and-white flag, protesters chanted songs as they listed their demands, including the reinstatement of gas and electricity subsidies whose removal as part of the governments audacious reforms to grow the economy has had a knock-on effect on the price of just about everything else.

        "date": "August 2, 2024 04:46 pm",
        "content": "The Sri Lanka Navy has issued a statement clarifying the recent incident involving an Indian fishing boat which caused death to a fisherman in the Sri Lankan waters off the Delft Island, Jaffna. In the statement, Sri Lanka Navy said that having spotted Indian fishing trawlers poaching in Sri Lankan waters off the Delft Island, Jaffna, the Sri Lanka Navy deployed its craft in the dark hours of July 31, 2024 to prevent poaching by the trawlers in question. During Navys efforts to seize some of the Indian fishing trawlers poaching in Sri Lankan waters, the trawlers attempted to evade the Navy with aggressive manoeuvres, defying Navys orders, the statement added. During this incident, a trawler continued on its course after colliding with a naval craft. Moments later, the Navy observed the trawler capsizing and sinking, the navy said. Furthermore, the statement said that responding swiftly, the Sri Lanka Navy launched a search and rescue operation for four Indian fishermen and that the navy personnel tossed lifesaving gear to the sinking trawler and successfully rescued three fishermen. Of the three fishermen rescued, one was in critical condition and was admitted to the nearest Punguduthivu Hospital in Jaffna for treatment. However, hospital authorities have confirmed that the fisherman was deceased upon admission, the navy added. Sri Lanka Navy also pointed out that amidst rough seas and strong winds, the other fisherman, who was floating with a lifebelt, disappeared into the sea before the naval craft could rescue him. Additionally, the Navy said it continues the search and rescue operation off Delft Island to locate the missing fisherman and that the operation has been joined by Indian Coast Guard craft as well. Meanwhile, the other two fishermen rescued by the Navy are in good health while those two fishermen, along with the deceased, will be handed over to the Indian authorities, it added.",

        "title": "3 newly freed Americans are back on US soil after landmark prisoner exchange with Russia",
        "date": "August 2, 2024 05:02 pm",
        "content": "The United States and Russia completed their biggest prisoner swap in post-Soviet history on Thursday, with Moscow releasing journalist Evan Gershkovich and fellow American Paul Whelan, along with dissidents including Vladimir Kara-Murza, in a multinational deal that set two dozen people free. Gershkovich, Whelan and Alsu Kurmasheva, a journalist with dual U.S.-Russia citizenship, arrived on American soil shortly before midnight for a joyful reunion with their families. President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris also were at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland to greet them and dispense hugs all around. The trade unfolded despite relations between Washington and Moscow being at their lowest point since the Cold War after Russian President Vladimir Putins February 2022 invasion of Ukraine. Negotiators in backchannel talks at one point explored an exchange involving Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny, but after his death in February ultimately stitched together a 24-person deal that required significant concessions from European allies, including the release of a Russian assassin, and secured freedom for a cluster of journalists, suspected spies, political prisoners and others. Biden trumpeted the exchange, by far the largest in a series of swaps with Russia, as a diplomatic feat while welcoming families of the returning Americans to the White House. But the deal, like others before it, reflected an innate imbalance: The U.S. and allies gave up Russians charged or convicted of serious crimes in exchange for Russia releasing journalists, dissidents and others imprisoned by the countrys highly politicized legal system on charges seen by the West as trumped-up. Deals like this one come with tough calls, Biden said. He added, Theres nothing that matters more to me than protecting Americans at home and abroad. Under the deal, Russia released Gershkovich, a reporter for The Wall Street Journal who was jailed in 2023 and convicted in July of espionage charges that he and the U.S. government vehemently denied. His family said in a statement released by the newspaper that we cant wait to give him the biggest hug and see his sweet and brave smile up close. The papers editor-in-chief, Emma Tucker, called it a joyous day. While we waited for this momentous day, we were determined to be as loud as we could be on Evans behalf. We are so grateful for all the voices that were raised when his was silent. We can finally say, in unison, Welcome home, Evan, she wrote in a letter posted online. Also released was Whelan, a Michigan corporate security executive jailed since 2018, also on espionage charges he and Washington have denied, and Kurmasheva, a Radio Free EuropeRadio Liberty journalist convicted in July of spreading false information about the Russian military, accusations her family and employer have rejected. The three flew from Maryland to Texas and landed at Joint Base San Antonio early Friday to begin medical evaluations after spending some time with their family members. If they choose, they can receive treatment the military offers to wrongfully detained Americans. The dissidents released included Kara-Murza, a Kremlin critic and Pulitzer Prize-winning writer serving 25 years on charges of treason widely seen as politically motivated, as well as multiple associates of Navalny. Freed Kremlin critics included Oleg Orlov, a veteran human rights campaigner convicted of discrediting the Russian military, and Ilya Yashin, imprisoned for criticizing the war in Ukraine. The Russian side got Vadim Krasikov, who was convicted in Germany in 2021 and sentenced to life in prison for killing a former Chechen rebel in a Berlin park two years earlier, apparently on the orders of Moscows security services. Throughout the negotiations, Moscow had been persistent in pressing for his release, with Putin himself raising it. At the time of Navalnys death, officials were discussing a possible exchange involving Krasikov. But with that prospect erased, senior U.S. officials, including national security adviser Jake Sullivan, made a fresh push to encourage Germany to release Krasikov. In the end, a handful of the prisoners Russia released were either German nationals or dual German-Russian nationals. Russia also received two alleged sleeper agents jailed in Slovenia, as well as three men charged by federal authorities in the U.S., including Roman Seleznev, a convicted computer hacker and the son of a Russian lawmaker, and Vadim Konoshchenok, a suspected Russian intelligence operative accused of providing American-made electronics and ammunition to the Russian military. Norway returned an academic arrested on suspicions of being a Russian spy; Poland sent back a man it detained on espionage charges. Today is a powerful example of why its vital to have friends in this world, Biden said. All told, six countries released at least one prisoner and a seventh, Turkey, participated by hosting the location for the swap, in Ankara. Biden placed securing the release of Americans held wrongfully overseas at the top of his foreign policy agenda for the six months before he leaves office. In an Oval Office address discussing his decision to drop his bid for a second term, Biden said, Were also working around the clock to bring home Americans being unjustly detained all around the world. At one point Thursday, he grabbed the hand of Whelans sister, Elizabeth, and said she had practically been living at the White House as the administration tried to free Paul. He then motioned for Kurmashevas daughter, Miriam, to come closer and took her hand, telling the room it was her 13th birthday. He asked everyone to sing Happy Birthday with him. She wiped tears from her eyes. The Biden administration has now brought home more than 70 Americans detained in other countries as part of deals that have required the U.S. to give up a broad array of convicted criminals, including for drug and weapons offenses. The swaps, though celebrated with fanfare, have spurred criticism that they incentivize future hostage-taking and give adversaries leverage over the U.S. and its allies. The U.S. governments top hostage negotiator, Roger Carstens, has sought to defend the deals by saying the number of wrongfully detained Americans has actually gone down even as swaps have increased. Tucker, the Journals editor-in-chief, acknowledged the debate, writing, We know the U.S. government is keenly aware, as are we, that the only way to prevent a quickening cycle of arresting innocent people as pawns in cynical geopolitical games is to remove the incentive for Russia and other nations that pursue the same detestable practice. Though she called for a change to the dynamic, for now, she wrote, we are celebrating the return of Evan. Thursdays swap of 24 prisoners surpassed a deal involving 14 people that was struck in 2010. In that exchange, Washington freed 10 Russians living in the U.S. as sleepers, while Moscow deported four Russians, including Sergei Skripal, a double agent working with British intelligence. He and his daughter in 2018 were nearly killed in Britain by nerve agent poisoning blamed on Russian agents. Speculation had mounted for weeks that a swap was near because of a confluence of unusual developments, including a startlingly quick trial for Gershkovich, which Washington regarded as a sham. He was sentenced to 16 years in a maximum-security prison. In a trial that concluded in two days in secrecy in the same week as Gershkovichs, Kurmasheva was convicted on charges of spreading false information about the Russian military that her family, employer and U.S. officials rejected. Also in recent days, several other figures imprisoned in Russia for speaking out against the war in Ukraine or over their work with Navalny were moved from prison to unknown locations. Gershkovich was arrested March 29, 2023, while on a reporting trip to the Ural Mountains city of Yekaterinburg. Authorities claimed, without offering any evidence, that he was gathering secret information for the U.S. The son of Soviet emigres who settled in New Jersey, he moved to Russia in 2017 to work for The Moscow Times newspaper before being hired by the Journal in 2022. Gershkovich was designated as wrongfully detained, as was Whelan, who was detained in December 2018 after traveling to Russia for a wedding. Whelan, who was serving a 16-year prison sentence, had been excluded from prior high-profile deals involving Russia, including the April 2022 swap by Moscow of imprisoned Marine veteran Trevor Reed for Konstantin Yaroshenko, a Russian pilot convicted in a drug trafficking conspiracy. That December, the U.S. released notorious arms trafficker Viktor Bout in exchange for WNBA star Brittney Griner, who had been jailed on drug charges. Paul Whelan is free. Our family is grateful to the United States government for making Pauls freedom a reality, his family said in a statement. On a warm and steamy night, the freed Americans lingered on the tarmac at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland, soaking up the moment of their return to the U.S. They took selfies with family members and friends, shared hugs with Biden and Harris, and patted loved ones on the back and smothered them with kisses. At one point, Biden gave Whelan the flag pin off his own lapel. Source: AP --Agencies",
