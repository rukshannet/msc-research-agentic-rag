        "content": "The Ceylon Chamber of Commerce has urged all political parties and concerned stakeholders to act with responsibility and await the finalization of the proposed debt restructuring plan. In a statement published on Tuesday (June 27), the Ceylon Chamber stressed the importance of patience and trust in the domestic debt restructuring process. In the domestic debt restructuring process, as emphasized by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka, the primary focus will be on maintaining financial system stability and ensuring that depositors will not be adversely impacted, the statement read further. It is vital that we collectively allow for comprehensive and thorough examination of the proposed plan, followed by constructive dialogue based on the final document. Only then can meaningful consensus be achieved, keeping the national interest as priority. Seeking both political and public support for the debt restructuring process, the Ceylon Chamber pointed out that this be a crucial step of the overall debt sustainability agenda and will assist in driving forward the other crucial reforms connected to it. Addressing the numerous concerns that are rife following the announcement of the Governments intention to restructure Sri Lankas domestic debt, the Chamber said it understands these concerns and recognizes the right to an open dialogue, however, we must be mindful of the market sensitivities around restructuring debt and the need to avoid misinformation and speculation, which fuels uncertainty amongst the general public. The Ceylon Chamber remains committed to fostering productive, informed dialogue and collaboration amongst all stakeholders. We trust that all parties involved in the discussion will uphold this principle for the benefit of our nations socio-economic development.",

        "title": "Hunger kills hundreds after US and UN pause food aid to Ethiopias Tigray region, officials say",
        "date": "June 27, 2023 06:12 pm",
        "content": "Hunger has killed at least 700 people in Ethiopias northern Tigray region in recent weeks after the United States and the United Nations paused food aid, local officials and researchers say. The U.N. and the U.S. first suspended food aid to Tigray in March after the discovery of a scheme to steal donated wheat intended for needy people. They extended the pause to the rest of Ethiopia in early June, affecting 20 million people in need, or about one-sixth of the countrys population. Tigrays Disaster Risk Management Commission has recorded 728 hunger-related deaths in three of the regions seven zones since the food aid was suspended in March. The data is based on information gathered by district officials, said the commission leader, Gebrehiwot Gebregziaher. The situation in Tigray is very difficult. Many people are dying because of the food shortage, Gebrehiwot said. The figure includes 350 hunger deaths in the northwest zone of Tigray, which hosts thousands of people displaced by a two-year conflict in the region that ended in November. In mid-March, U.S. aid officials found enough food aid for 134,000 people for sale in a local market in Shire, the zones biggest town. Separately, researchers at Mekele University in the regional capital have documented 165 hunger deaths in seven camps for internally displaced people in Tigray since the food aid suspension began. There are over 100 such camps across the region. The deaths were reported by camp coordinators to the researchers, who are studying people displaced by the recent war. Most of the deaths are of children, old people and people with underlying health conditions, said one researcher, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals. He linked the deaths directly to the aid suspension. A U.N. update published on June 14 said the number of children admitted to hospitals in Tigray for malnutrition rose by 196 between April 2022 and April 2023. The recent war left 5.4 million out of 6 million people in Tigray reliant on food aid. During the conflict, both sides looted humanitarian supplies and the government restricted aid access, leading U.N. investigators to accuse it of using starvation as a method of warfare. A ceasefire signed in November had allowed aid deliveries to resume to the region. Aid workers have told The Associated Press, which first reported the food aid theft, that senior Ethiopian government officials were deeply involved. The U.S. is refusing to reinstate food aid until they are removed from the aid distribution process and stronger checks are introduced. Ethiopias government dismisses as harmful propaganda the suggestion that it bears primary responsibility for the disappearance of aid in Tigray and other regions, but it has agreed to a joint investigation with the U.S. while the U.N.s World Food Program carries out a separate probe. Although they have suspended deliveries of food, the U.S. and WFP continue to run nutrition programs for women and children. However, these have been hampered by a lack of funding.

        "date": "June 27, 2023 06:23 pm",
        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe assured that the restructuring of domestic debt will have no impact on the membership balance of any public funds, including the Employees Provident Fund (EPF). He emphasized that the rate of return for superannuation funds will not be affected in any way. Furthermore, the President stated that the restructuring of domestic debt will not pose any threat to the stability of the countrys banking system, whether it be public or private banks. He specifically mentioned that the deposits of more than 50 million bank depositors will remain unaffected, and there will be no changes to the current interest rates paid on bank deposits. President Ranil Wickremesinghe also announced that proposals for restructuring both foreign and domestic debt will be presented to the Cabinet tomorrow (28). The President made these statements while inaugurating the Gampaha District Secretariat Administrative Complex, Laksiyane Mandiraya, which has been constructed with the aim of providing efficient and regular government services to the people of the Gampaha district. The complex, with an expenditure of nearly Rs. 4 billion, stands at seven stories tall. It was highlighted that Sri Lankas total public debt, comprising both domestic and foreign debt, amounted to 83,700 million by the end of 2022, representing 128.3 of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Of this amount, the foreign debt totalled 41,500 million, accounting for 63.6 of the GDP. The President also noted that the domestic debt at that time stood at 42,100 million, which constituted 64.6 of the GDP. The President highlighted the urgency of restructuring the countrys debt, stating that without such measures, the public debt would exceed 100 of the GDP by 2035. He emphasized that foreign creditors have already expressed their agreement to participate in the debt restructuring process. To ensure debt sustainability in Sri Lanka, the President emphasized the need for restructuring both external and domestic debt. Acknowledging the significant burden carried by foreign creditors, he mentioned that the country is set to receive 17 billion US dollars from them in the next five years. The President emphasized the importance of local creditors also contributing to this effort. The proposed debt restructuring plan has been designed with the primary objective of safeguarding the publics bank deposits. The President underlined the responsibility of protecting the depositors of all banks regulated by the Central Bank. He assured that the proposed domestic debt restructuring method poses no harm to bank depositors and will not lead to a collapse of the banking system. On the contrary, it will pave the way for a restructuring process that can rebuild the economy. The President further stated that the countrys economic recovery, reduction in interest rates, the governments ability to provide subsidies easily, and the reduction of both domestic and foreign debt burden in the next decade will yield positive results benefiting the people of the country. During his official visit to France, the President engaged in discussions with Commonwealth Secretary General Patricia Scotland, International Monetary Fund Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva, Netherlands Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Sigrid Kaag, American Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, and Japanese Foreign Minister Yoshimasa Hayashi regarding foreign debt restructuring. The President highlighted the progress being made in Sri Lankas financial sector during these discussions. He expressed satisfaction that they were all eager to assist in reversing the crisis in Sri Lanka and affirmed their commitment to contribute significantly to the countrys economic recovery. The President also said that during a recent telephone conversation with the Indian Finance Minister, Mrs. Nirmala Sitharaman, she had expressed her countrys intention to positively contribute to Sri Lankas debt restructuring and economic stability. The President said that he would hold detailed discussions on the matter during his upcoming visit to India. The President also mentioned that Foreign Minister Ali Sabri, who is currently on an official visit to China, has agreed to enhance bilateral relations and strengthen economic ties between the two countries. Minister Sabri held fruitful discussions with Chinas Foreign Minister, Mr. Qin Gang, sharing their views on deepening cooperation. President Ranil Wickremesinghe further revealed that, during a meeting with the Chinese Finance Minister, Liu Kun, in Beijing, he was briefed on the economic stabilization and progress plan of the country. Minister Ali Sabri expressed gratitude for Chinas special contribution during the previous crisis. During the visit, the President held discussions with the Chairman of the Chinese Exim Bank, Wu Fulin, and other Chinese officials appointed for the purpose of restructuring Sri Lankas foreign debt. They assured their commitment to contribute to the debt restructuring process in the best possible manner. The event was attended by Prime Minister Dinesh Gunawardena, Ministers Prasanna Ranatunga, Nalin Fernando, State Ministers Shehan Semasinghe, Prasanna Ranaweera, Sisira Jayakodi, Lasantha Alagiyawanna, Janaka Wakkambura, Gampaha District Development Committee Chairman and Members of Parliament Sahan Pradeep, Nimal Lanza, Sudarshanee Fernandopulle, Milan Jayathilaka, Presidents Senior Adviser on Climate Change Ruwan Wijewardena, Western Province Governor Roshan Gunathilaka, and other dignitaries. --PMD",

        "date": "June 28, 2023 08:21 am",
        "content": "The world lost an area of old-growth tropical rainforest the size of Switzerland last year, as deforestation of the Brazilian Amazon continued unabated, a forest monitoring project report said on Tuesday. Global Forest Watch, which is backed by the non-profit World Resources Institute (WRI) and draws on forest data collected by the University of Maryland, revealed that about 41,000 sq km (16,000 sq miles) of tropical rainforest was lost in 2022. That was the final year of Jair Bolsonaros government in Brazil, which accounted for more than 40 of all losses. Despite a recent global pledge to reach zero deforestation by 2030, tropical forest loss last year exceeded 2021 levels. 2022 numbers are particularly disheartening, said Francis Seymour, a WRI official. We had hoped by now to see a signal in the data that we were turning the corner on forest loss. Global Forest Watch assessed primary forests, which includes mature forests that have not been cleared or regrown in recent history. Such forests protect against climate change because they absorb vast amounts of carbon dioxide. Last years losses in the tropics released some 2.7 gigatons of carbon dioxide, equivalent to Indias annual fossil fuel emissions, the report said. Indonesia and Malaysia managed to keep forest loss near a record low, continuing a multiyear streak of stamping down deforestation driven by oil palm plantations. Strict Indonesian policies, such as a moratorium on new licences in primary forest and peatland, helped the turnabout. Other forest-rich nations have struggled to keep up with Asias progress. The Democratic Republic of the Congo and Bolivia suffered the greatest losses of tropical forest after Brazil. Commodity agriculture was largely responsible for deforestation in Bolivia, experts said, as the government supports agribusiness expansion. Bolivia is one of few nations not to join the zero-deforestation pledge. But that pledge has not yet made a difference. The Global Forest Watch analysis found deforestation in 2022 was more than 10,000 sq km (3,900 sq miles) in excess of what would be needed to halt it by 2030. We are far off track and trending in the wrong direction, said Rod Taylor, WRIs global forests program director. The world lost 10 less forest in 2022 than 2021, as fewer big fires burned in the Russian boreal forest, though the country still lost 43,000 sq km (16,600 sq miles) of tree cover last year.

        "date": "June 28, 2023 11:23 am",
        "content": "Sri Lankan tea prices that had been piping hot have cooled off as production in the worlds fourth-largest tea grower begins to recover. The benchmark weekly average price on the Colombo Tea Auction came to around 965 Sri Lankan rupees (3.12) per kilogram in mid-June, the lowest in about 15 months. Prices are also about 40 below the all-time high reached in September. Tea exports are a major source of foreign currency for Sri Lanka, which has been mired in financial crisis for over a year. The government kept supporting farmers despite the lack of cash during that time. The factors driving the decline boil down to a recovery in supply. Tea leaf production had been down on the year until March, then logged an 8 year-on-year increase in April, followed by a 2 rise for May. The recovery comes after Sri Lanka defaulted on its debt in May 2022 and its shrinking foreign currency reserves made it difficult to import sufficient amounts of fertilizer. Even when planned blackouts and restrictions on gasoline sales were rolled out, priority was given to supplies of diesel for shipping tea from tea-farming regions and fuel for power generators at tea processors in Colombo, said Yasunari Uchimura at S. Ishimitsu, a Japanese importer and wholesaler of coffee, tea and other beverages. Production also rose after the country secured a 3 billion bailout from the International Monetary Fund in March, which contributed to increased fertilizer imports. Income from tea exports, which account for 10 of total export revenue, increased to 411 billion Sri Lankan rupees in 2022, a 56 jump on the year, and soared 44 during the first five months of 2023. With the support from IMF and revenue from exports of tea and other primary commodities, the worst days are behind Sri Lanka, said Toru Nishihama, chief economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute in Japan. Sri Lanka had about 2.7 billion in foreign exchange reserves in April, up 70 from a low in October. Some predict the decline in tea prices will be short-lived. Tea-growing regions are set to see a dry season in late July, when production tends to decrease while quality continues to improve. In August and onward, main customer Russia is expected to step up purchases ahead of its peak consumption season late in the year. Prices will move toward 1,000 Sri Lankan rupees again, one observer said. Source  Nikkei Asia -Agencies",

        "content": "South Koreans became a year or two younger on Wednesday as new laws that require using only the international method of counting age took effect, replacing the countrys traditional method. Under the age system most commonly used in South Koreans everyday life, people are deemed to be a year old at birth and a year is added every Jan. 1. The country has since the early 1960s used the international norm of calculating from zero at birth and adding a year on every birthday for medical and legal documents. But many South Koreans continued to use the traditional method for everything else. In December, South Korea passed laws to scrap the traditional method and fully adopt the international standard. We expect legal disputes, complaints and social confusion that have been caused over how to calculate ages will be greatly reduced, Minister of Government Legislation Lee Wan-kyu told a briefing on Monday. According to a government survey conducted in September 2022, 86 of South Koreans said they would use the international age in their everyday life when the new laws took effect. I was about to turn 30 next year (under the traditional Korean age system) but now I have some more time earned and I love it, Choi Hyun-ji, a 27-year-old office worker in Seoul, said. Its just great to feel like getting younger, Choi added. Another age system exists in South Korea for conscription, school entrance and calculating the legal age to drink alcohol and smoke: a persons age is calculated from zero at birth and a year is added on Jan. 1. Officials said that method would remain for the time being. Source  Reuters -Agencies",

        "content": "Bruno Divakara, who recently found himself in hot water after stand-up comedian Nathasha Edirisooriya went viral for certain remarks she had made, has been summoned before the Illegal Assets Investigation Division of the Criminal Investigation Department (CID). Divakara was summoned this morning (28 June) in connection with an ongoing investigation. Speaking to the media upon his arrival to the CID in order to record a statement, Divakara said It is evident that someone wants us to keep our mouth shut. If this is their way of doing that, we too will maximize our efforts to continue with our work despite such obstacles. Divakara, the owner of a YouTube channel by the name of SL VLOG, was arrested by the CID on 31 May, after being grilled for over 08 hours over the recent controversial statements made by Nathasha Edirisooriya. He was, however, later granted bail on 21 June, while Edirisooriya remains in remand custody until 05 July. Edirisooriya was arrested by the CID on 28 May at the Katunayake Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA), while trying to fly out of the country. She had landed herself in hot water over certain remarks she had made, allegedly insulting multiple religions during her segment at a recent stand-up comedy show hosted at a leading school in Colombo.",

        "date": "June 28, 2023 03:13 pm",
        "content": "The Bar Association of Sri Lanka (BASL), in a letter addressed to President Ranil Wickremesinghe, has urged him to make the best possible appointment for the post of Inspector-General of Police IGP) as the public confidence in the police is vital for the administration of justice and the rule of law. The position fell vacant after the tenure extension given to IGP C.D. Wickramaratne came to an end on June 26. Wickramaratnes service period, which was initially supposed to end on March 26, was extended for three months in a special gazette notification issued by the President on April 06. Senior Deputy Inspector-Generals of Police (SDIGs) Deshabandu Tennakoon, Nilantha Jayawardena, Lalith Pathinayake, Priyantha Weerasooriya and Ajith Rohana are widely tipped to be among the nominations for the top post of the police force. As speculations are rife as to who the next IGP would be, the BASL has emphasized that it is of utmost importance that the next IGP should be an officer whose service in the police force is exemplary and unblemished and able to restore public confidence in the Sri Lanka Police. The association notes that the erosion of public confidence in the police boils down to lack of independence, politicization, police brutality, custodial deaths and lack of professionalism. Further, we are of the view that the Easter Sunday attack is a clear example of the grave ramifications of incompetent individuals holding such high office. The BASL went on to note that prior to the approval of the appointment of the police chief, the procedures to be followed with regard to recommendations or approvals for appointments under Article 41B or 41C should be determined by the Constitutional Council as provided for in Article 41E(6) of the Constitution.",

        "title": "France heightens security after unrest prompted by police shooting of 17-year-old",
        "date": "June 28, 2023 03:28 pm",
        "content": "Frances government on Wednesday announced heightened police presence around Paris and other big cities and called for calm after scattered violence erupted over the death of a 17-year-old delivery driver who was shot and killed during a police check. The death prompted nationwide concern and widespread messages of indignation and condolences, including from soccer star Kylian Mbappe. It also triggered unrest in multiple towns around Paris. Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin said 31 people were arrested, 25 police officers injured and 40 cars burned in overnight unrest. The tensions focused around the Paris suburb of Nanterre, where lawyers say 17-year-old Nael M. was killed Tuesday during a traffic check. The police officer suspected of firing on him was detained and faces potential manslaughter charges, according to the Nanterre prosecutors office. The Nanterre neighborhood where Nael lived remained tense Wednesday morning, with police on guard and burned car wreckage and overturned garbage bins still visible in some areas. Naels mother appealed online for a silent march on Thursday in her sons honor, near the scene of his death. Videos purported to be of the incident were extremely shocking, Darmanin said, pledging a full investigation. The images show two police officers leaning into the driver-side window of a yellow car, before the vehicle pulls away as one officer fires into the window. The car is later seen crashed into a post nearby. I call for calm and truth, Darmanin said. He said 1,200 police were deployed overnight and 2,000 would be out in force Wednesday in the Paris region and around other big cities to maintain order. Deadly use of firearms is less common in France than in the United States. Tuesdays death unleashed anger in Nanterre and other towns, including around housing projects where many residents struggle with poverty and discrimination and feel police abuse is under-punished. A lawyer for Naels family, Yassine Bouzrou, told The Associated Press they want the police officer pursued for murder instead of manslaughter, and want the investigation handed to a different region because they fear Nanterre investigators wont be impartial. The lawyers refuted a reported statement by the police that their lives were in danger because the driver had threatened to run them over. Mbappe, who grew up in the Paris suburb of Bondy, was among those who were shocked by what happened. I hurt for my France. Unacceptable situation. All my thoughts go to the family and loved ones of Nael, this little angel gone much too soon, he tweeted. The government will hold a security meeting Wednesday afternoon to discuss next steps, Darmanin said. The victim was wounded by a gunshot and died at the scene, the prosecutors office said in a statement. A passenger in the car was briefly detained and released, and police are searching for another passenger who fled. Several people have died or sustained injuries at the hands of French police in recent years, prompting demands for more accountability. France also saw protests against racial profiling and other injustice in the wake of George Floyds killing by police in Minnesota. Source - The Associated Press -Agencies",

        "date": "June 28, 2023 03:33 pm",
        "content": "The Committee on Public Enterprises (COPE) has informed the officials of Lanka Sathosa Ltd to prepare a comprehensive plan up until 2028 and report on its activities within 2 months while also instructing to prepare an action plan for the state-owned retail network business. Lanka Sathosa Ltd was called before the Committee on Public Enterprises recently under the chairmanship of Member of Parliament (Prof.) Ranjith Bandara. Here, attention was drawn towards the fact that a concrete plan for 2021-24 was in place but it was not approved by the Ministry, the Communications Department of Parliament said. Thus, the Committee Chair informed the officials to prepare a comprehensive plan up until 2028 and report on its activities within 2 months. He further instructed to prepare an action plan. Attention was also directed towards internal audit queries not being done properly. It was discussed that although there are 21 internal auditor staff, only 3 audit queries have been submitted for the year 2021 and none for the year 2022. Moreover, attention was drawn to the auditors difficulty in obtaining information regarding the companys accounts. Accordingly, the Auditor General also informed that the Internal Audit Department should be notified in this regard through an internal circular. The statement said that during the meeting, a decision was reached to discuss separately the loss of Rs. 6 billion due to the importation of rice. It was disclosed that during 2014-2015, there was a loss of Rs. 6 billion due to the importation of rice through Lanka Sathosa. It was also discussed that the imported has been sold for animal feed due to expiry. A report has been prepared by the Auditor General regarding this incident and thus it was decided at the Committee to discuss this matter in the future, the release said. The Chair also said that the loss of Lanka Sathosa in 2022 is close to Rs. 600 million. It was also discussed that the total loss by December 31st, 2021 is close to Rs. 15 billion. It was discussed in the Committee that instead of importing and selling goods, Lanka Sathosa has missed the opportunity to sell goods at a lower price to the customer and gain more profit for the company by buying and selling goods from the Pettah. Furthermore, the officials explained about the loss due to the delay in receiving money even though the goods are imported based on the policy decisions taken by the government. The COPE Chair emphasized the need to prepare a business model suitable for Sathosa. The Auditor General also pointed out the internal administrative weaknesses as well as the need to establish this institution under a business model that can make decisions independently without external interference. The Committee also emphasized the need to attract more customers to Lanka Sathosa stores. It was revealed that there are 1,123 employee vacancies in the institution and the Auditor General pointed out the need for a re-evaluation before filling those employee vacancies. It was also decided to re-summon Lanka Sathosa on August 22nd. Members of Parliament Mahindananda Aluthgamage, Dayasiri Jayasekara, Nimal Lanza, Jayantha Samaraweera, S. M. M. Muszhaaraff, S. M. Marikkar, Sanjeeva Edirimanna, Shanakiyan Rasamanickam, Madhura Withanage, (Prof.) Charitha Herath, were present at the Committee meeting held.",

The event was organised by Britain Tamil Sangam and Sangamam UK, a UK-based Tamil cultural organisation. In his speech, Annamalai highlighted the alarming decrease in the Hindu population in Sri Lankas north and eastern provinces. The significant decline in the Hindu population in the north and eastern provinces of Sri Lanka is an area of concern. This trend is worrisome as it will have a detrimental impact on the regions culture in the years to come, said Annamalai. He further pointed out the emergence of Buddhist archaeological sites in the north and eastern provinces, which has caused tensions between Tamils and Buddhists. The northern and eastern provinces have maintained a unique culture and identity for more than a thousand years. However, the recent appearance of Buddhist archaeological sites in these areas has resulted in tension between Tamils and Buddhists. Resolving this issue is crucial for lasting peace and finding a permanent solution in the coming decade, added Annamalai. During his visit to the UK, Annamalai conducted several meetings with the Tamil diaspora, emphasising the nine-year achievements of the BJP government in India and Indias contributions to the Sri Lankan Tamil community in recent years.

        "content": "Minister of Foreign Affairs Ali Sabry has stated that it is good to have multiple big players in the world, as opposed to a single monopoly-like player, and has called for the West to come to terms with this. During an interview with CGTN reporter Zhou Yiqiu in Beijing about Chinas role in global economic growth, Sabry said people are getting tired of only one big player in the world. The West should come to terms that the unipolar world has come to an end, and now this is the multipolar world. In that, people should get used to it, its good to have two or three big players in the world rather than one player, people are tired of it, he said. Speaking on Chinas role in the recovering economy, Sabry expressed his confidence that China will step up to the plate, and successfully play the integral role he anticipates they will have in the relevant process. I think China has a great role to play, and China will play that role, he emphasised. Sabry, is currently in China to participate in the World Economic Forum being held in Tianjin from 27 to 29 June.

        "date": "June 28, 2023 07:00 pm",
        "content": "State Minister of Finance Ranjith Siyambalapitiya says that instructions have been issued to collect the taxes due from certain liquor manufactures in the country, within a period of 14 days. The State Minister points out that the Government is due around Rs. 6.16 billion in total, as a collective of taxes and overdue payments from distilleries. The relevant tax payments are due to be collected from 10 liquor manufacturing companies, Siyambalapitiya pointed out, adding that the companies were summoned yesterday (27) and informed to complete those payments within 14 days. State Minister Siyambalapitiya further expressed that action will be taken against those companies if they will fail to take measures to settle the due payments within the stipulated time. Meanwhile, Siyambalapitiya stated that a series of unique recommendations including the establishment of a special court will soon be submitted for the Presidents approval to resolve the legal problems emerging in tax collection. The State Minister stated that the plan incorporates several particular topics to address practical challenges linked to tax collection, the Presidents Media Division (PMD) reported. According to the Minister, raising state income is a key economic concern in the country, thus it is critical to collect taxes legally in order to enhance state income. As a result, the Minister instructed the liquor manufacturing companies that have already defaulted to pay the related amount within 14 days. He also mentioned that a special order has been issued. The Minister stated that the country still has a voluntary tax system, which should be rectified immediately, the PMD said. State Minister Ranjith Siyambalapitiya expressed these views while attending the press conference organized by the Presidential Media Centre (PMC) today (28) under the theme One path to a stable country. The State Minister of Finance further commented; By 2022, the country would have the lowest tax revenue in relation to GDP. This amounts to 7.3. However, Government spending ranged between 19 and 20. The Government at the time attempted to compensate for this difference. There, the country was in a financial crisis. It was even necessary to print money. The decline in Government revenue became a vital component in the recent economic crisis. Increasing Government revenue is a crucial concern in the countrys economy. Government revenue can be increased only by increasing taxes. Tax collection, whether direct or indirect, is a difficult undertaking. However, the current tax system has been brought to a suitable level. I would like to congratulate everyone who has paid their taxes despite the countrys economic problems. To some extent, the people have recognized the importance of the Government. State revenue increased from 7.3 of GDP in 2022 to 15.8 in the first quarter of 2023. It is a crucial junction. In general, a Government attempts to raise direct taxes. The Governments goal is to keep the existing tax rate constant. The administration does not intend to levy new taxes on citizens. When possible, the Government attempts to offer help to the people. The Government is well aware of the recent increase in bank interest rates. The Government reduced the bank interest rate by 2.5 last week. Similarly, we intend to make certain tax-collection concessions to the people in the future. Only 300,000 persons are now paying taxes. The amount of income files should be 1 million in order to enhance state tax collection. If this occurs, it will be possible to cut the amount of taxes levied on specific individuals in the country. Tax filings foster better Government ties. The Government has invited 14 eminent groups of experts in the society to open the tax files. Taxpayers are considered as strong citizens of the country. Also, the Government spends peoples tax money with proper management. Six circulars have been issued concerning the use of tax money. No Government has ever managed tax money as well as the current administration. So there should be no issues. The Government has taken steps to secure the taxpayers money. For example, under the Aswesuma welfare benefit payment program, the Government makes every effort to offer welfare benefits solely to those who deserve. True information should also be provided while supplying information under Aswesuma. Furthermore, the person obtaining the information is obligated to receive accurate information. These are disliked by many people. In the midst of multiple accusations and challenges, the Government is attempting to provide eligible individuals with Aswesuma welfare benefits. The system of granting social benefits depending on political ties should be abolished immediately. So far, plans have been put in place to collect taxes from persons who have evaded from paying their taxes. Our country has a tax structure that is entirely voluntary. For example, we might query about someones earnings. That is where the tax collection process begins. Some resort to court in order to collect taxes. There will thereafter be years of court proceedings. Many cases remain unresolved. There are numerous practical issues with the tax collection process. A proposal has been sent to President Ranil Wickremesinghe in order to find solutions to the practical challenges of tax collection. It has been proposed to establish a special tax court. Meanwhile, excise duty has been raised by 20. In addition, the liquor manufacturing companies were given a special order to pay the unpaid taxes within 14 days. We currently owe 83 billion dollars as a country. Of that, 41 billion dollars have been paid as foreign loans and 42 billion dollars as local loans. Everyone must make some sacrifices in order to make the country stable. In the future, we can talk about technical aspects of domestic debt restructuring. But now is the time to try to rebuild the fallen country. How many scapegoats wandered in this country when the assistance from the International Monetary Fund was sought? This is such a country. Banks are closed for a few days to prepare this structure with proper management. Account holders, bank stability, and pension funds will be unaffected. Now some people are trying to destabilize the country through Aswesuma. We must contend with a classic opposition. Sri Lanka is an ordinary country. Nothing new will be accomplished if conspiracies are made again. This will cause the country to regress even worse. The Government follows a well-planned and a visionary strategy.",

        "date": "June 28, 2023 10:18 pm",
        "content": "The United States took aim at Russias Wagner Group and imposed sanctions on Tuesday on companies it accused of engaging in illicit gold dealings to fund the mercenary force. The U.S. Treasury Department in a statement said it slapped sanctions on four companies in the United Arab Emirates, Central African Republic and Russia it accused of being connected to the Wagner Group and its leader, Yevgeny Prigozhin. The companies engaged in illicit gold dealings to fund the militia to sustain and expand its armed forces, including in Ukraine and some countries in Africa, the Treasury said. The Wagner Group funds its brutal operations in part by exploiting natural resources in countries like the Central African Republic and Mali, the Treasurys Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence, Brian Nelson, said in a statement. The United States will continue to target the Wagner Groups revenue streams to degrade its expansion and violence in Africa, Ukraine, and anywhere else. The Wagner Group did not immediately respond to the U.S. allegations. The U.S. State Department ahead of the announcement said that the action against Wagner was unrelated to an aborted mutiny last weekend. Wagner, whose men in Ukraine include thousands of ex-prisoners recruited from Russian jails, has grown into a sprawling international business with mining interests and fighters in Africa and the Middle East. Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Tuesday that the finances of Prigozhins catering firm would be investigated after his mutiny, saying Wagner and its founder had received almost 2 billion from Russia in the past year. Wagner has fought in Libya, Syria, the Central African Republic, Mali and other countries, and has fought the bloodiest battles of the 16-month-old war in Ukraine. It was founded in 2014 after Russia annexed Ukraines Crimea peninsula and started supporting pro-Russia separatists in Ukraines eastern Donbas region. The United States has previously imposed sanctions on Wagner and Prigozhin. Washington has repeatedly warned of what it says are Wagners destabilizing activities and has ramped up sanctions against the private army following Russias invasion of Ukraine. The companies hit with sanctions on Tuesday included Central African Republic-based Midas Ressources SARLU and Diamville SAU, Dubai-based Industrial Resources General Trading and Russia-based Limited Liability Company DM. The United States also issued an advisory highlighting risks raised by gold trade in sub-Saharan Africa due to what it said was increasingly concerning reporting related to the role of illicit actors, including the Wagner Group. Washington also imposed sanctions on Andrey Nikolayevich Ivanov, a Russian national the Treasury accused of being an executive in the Wagner Group and said he worked closely with senior Malian officials on weapons deals, mining concerns and other Wagner activities in the country. Russias embassy in Washington and Industrial Resources did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Reuters could not immediately reach a spokesperson for Midas Ressources, Diamville or Limited Liability Company DM. Source - Reuters -Agencies",

        "date": "June 29, 2023 07:11 am",
        "content": "The World Bank, on Thursday (June 28), approved USD 700 million in financing as budgetary and welfare support for Sri Lanka. This is the biggest funding trance for the island nation since the International Monetary Fund (IMF) bailout package in March. Through this funding, the World Bank said it aims to help Sri Lanka implement foundational reforms that restore macroeconomic stability and sustainability, mitigate the impact of current and future shocks on the poor and vulnerable, and support an inclusive and private sector-led recovery and growth path. Thereby, USD 500 million of the funds will be allocated for the Sri Lanka Resilience, Stability  Economic Turnaround (RESET) Development Policy Operation which will support reforms that improve economic governance, enhance growth and competitiveness, and protect the poor and vulnerable. This operation will provide budgetary support in two equal tranches against agreed prior actions. Meanwhile, welfare support of USD 200 million will be earmarked for the Social Protection Project which seeks to support Sri Lanka in providing better-targeted income and livelihood opportunities to the poor and vulnerable and improving the responsiveness of the social protection program. The funding was green-lighted when the World Bank Groups Board of Executive Directors met for a discussion on the new Country Partnership Framework (CPF) for Sri Lanka on Thursday. The CPF comes at a time when Sri Lanka is navigating its worst economic crisis since its independence from Britain in 1948 after its foreign exchange dipped to record lows, resulting in its first foreign debt default in 2022. Covering the years 2024-2027, the CPF lays out a two-phased approach that starts with a focus on urgent macro-fiscal and structural reforms and support to protect the human capital and most vulnerable population. In March 2023, the IMF approved nearly USD 3 billion which Sri Lanka expects will bring additional funding of up to USD 4 billion from the World Bank, Asian Development Bank and other multilateral agencies. Speaking on the USD 700 million in financing green-lighted for the island nation, the World Bank Country Director for Sri Lanka said, the CPF offers a historic opportunity for deep reforms to reset the countrys economic storyline. Through a phased approach, the World Bank Group strategy focuses on early economic stabilization, structural reforms, and protection of the poor and vulnerable, Zervos said further. If sustained, these reforms can put the country back on the path towards a green, resilient and inclusive development, he added.",

        "date": "June 29, 2023 10:11 am",
        "content": "The Central Bank (CBSL) governor says the banking system is excluded from the Domestic Debt Optimization (DDO) process, in order to safeguard the treasury, strengthen the economy, and ensure the protection of the 57 million public and private bank deposits in Sri Lanka. Dr. Nandalal Weerasinghe explained that the banking system already contributes to the Treasury and the economy through taxes of over 50. He made these remarks addressing a special media briefing on Domestic Debt Optimization (DDO) held at the Presidential Media Centre this morning (June 29). The governor highlighted the severe repercussions that would result from a collapse in the countrys banking sector. To prevent such a scenario, June 30 (Friday) was declared a bank holiday until the parliament approves the restructuring of local debt. Dr. Nandalal Weerasinghe, reassuring the public that the existing Employee Provident Fund (EPF) would remain untouched, also he guaranteed a minimum interest rate of 9 for the EPF. In attendance at the press conference were Dr. R.H.S. Samaratunga, the Senior Advisor to the President on Economic Affairs, Mr. Mahinda Siriwardena, the Secretary of the Finance Ministry, Mr. A.K. Seneviratne, the Deputy Treasury Secretary, as well as heads of media organizations and media representatives. Dr. Nandalal Weerasinghe, commenting further on the DDO, said; In order to achieve a sustainable level of the governments domestic debt, we must work towards stabilizing the current criteria within a 10-year timeframe, as agreed upon with the International Monetary Fund (IMF). For instance, by the end of 2022, the public debt as a percentage of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) stood at 128. However, our target is to reduce it to below 95 by 2032, which is the first criterion. The second criterion involves reducing the governments total financing requirement, currently at 34.6 of the GDP annually, to an average level of 13 or lower during the 5 year period of 2027-2032. The third criterion pertains to foreign debt servicing, which currently accounts for 9.4 of the GDP. Our aim is to bring it down to 4.5 during the period of 2027-2032. Achieving these goals will lead to a reduction of 16.9 billion in the relief required to bridge the external financing gap. Additionally, there are three other tasks that need to be accomplished in order to attain these three objectives. There are three key aspects to address in the debt restructuring process. Firstly, discussions are underway regarding the restructuring of official bilateral debts. Secondly, there are on-going discussions regarding the money borrowed through sovereign bonds in commercial markets. Thirdly, there is a focus on optimizing domestic debt. The optimization of domestic credit plays a significant role in this overall process. Through the restructuring of local debts, the aim is to reduce the governments gross debt burden and meet its financial needs. If the proposed measures are implemented, it is projected that the gross financial need will decrease to 12.7, aiming for a value below 13. If successfully implemented, this would result in a reduction of public debt as a percentage of the gross domestic product, bringing it down to 90. Currently, there are 4.1 trillion in treasury bills, with 62.4 held by the Central Bank. Conversion of treasury bills into long-term treasury bonds has been proposed previously. However, additional measures are required, prompting consideration of treasury bonds to fulfil the remaining financial requirements. Presently, there are 8.7 trillion in treasury bonds, with 36.5 held by the superannuation fund and approximately 36 held by banks. The remaining portion is owned by insurance companies and private individuals. As the Central Bank, our primary concern is to find the best solution to ensure the stability of the banking system and the well-being of the Employee Provident Fund (EPF). The Central Bank, being the custodian of the EPF, actively participates in discussions and supports the proposed measures to safeguard deposits and protect public funds such as the EPF from any potential harm. According to the proposal, the banking system has already made a significant contribution to reducing the governments indebtedness. Currently, banks pay over 50 of their income as taxes, including 30 as company tax, 18 as VAT and financial services tax, and 2.5 as social security contribution. Therefore, more than 50 of the banks earnings are already allocated to taxes and contribute to the governments revenue. In comparison, superannuation funds have a lower tax rate of 14. Hence, the first point to note is that the banking system is already making a considerable contribution. Secondly, the banking system has incurred losses due to non-payment of loans resulting from economic challenges and grace periods provided. In the past, grace periods with a value of 1.6 trillion were granted, indicating that the banking system has already contributed to the economy. Protecting the banking system and ensuring the safety of depositors funds are crucial responsibilities. The banking system plays a vital role in the economy, as evidenced by the 57 million bank accounts holding deposits from a population of around 20 million. Any harm to these funds would have a severe impact on the banking system. As the Central Bank, our primary objective is to safeguard the banking system and the currency. Recently, there were rumours about bank collapses, and concerns were raised regarding the safety of deposits. Withdrawing deposits from banks would lead to an economic collapse. Therefore, the foremost effort is to protect the funds of depositors in the 57 million accounts without harming the banking system, as it would have the greatest social impact. Consequently, the banks should not be further burdened. Moving on to the superannuation funds, which include the Employee Provident Fund (EPF) and the Employees Trust Fund (ETF), they are subject to a 14 tax rate, which is lower than the tax rate imposed on banks. The proposal suggests retrieving all existing treasury bonds from these funds and issuing new bonds in return. These bonds will earn 12 interest until 2025 and 9 interest thereafter. Importantly, the amount in the EPF will not decrease, as the government guarantees a future benefit of 9 interest. The government assures that if there is any deficit, the treasury will cover it. Those who choose not to participate in the Treasury bond exchange have the option of paying a 30 tax instead of the standard 14 tax. We aim to complete the bond exchange within a few weeks and finalize this process in July.",

        "date": "June 29, 2023 10:13 am",
        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe, in his message for the 2023 Hajj festival, has deemed the festival an opportunity to honour the sacrifices made by the citizens of Sri Lanka in recent times, amidst the adversities faced by the country. He invited all Sri Lankans to join hands during this festival, and be united in a common cause to achieve the countrys domestic, regional and global goals. Below is the Presidents full message: In these challenging times, as we strive for a future filled with renewed hope, the advent of the Hajj festival this year is of extreme significance. The sacred festival of Hajj, embodies values and fulfilment derived from engaging in humanitarian endeavours, seeking solutions for the impoverished, without the expectation of respite from ones own difficulties. It is a testament of the spirit of selflessness and compassion. Prophet Ibrahim, his son Prophet Ishmael, and Mother Hagar stand as timeless symbols of dedication and sacrifice. For centuries, they have been revered universally, with their sacrifices being a source of gratitude and admiration. In recent times, Sri Lanka has faced its own share of adversity. However, it is through the unwavering dedication, sacrifice and patience of our citizens that these challenges have been faced and reached the present state. The Hajj festival is an opportune occasion to memorialize and honour those sacrifices. The collective efforts, interventions and participation of everyone, are crucial in overcoming the economic and social difficulties being currently faced. Therefore, I invite all Sri Lankan citizens to join hands during this Hajj festival, and be united in a common cause to achieve our domestic, regional and global goals. As we celebrate this joyous Hajj festival, I wish to remind the present generation, as well as the elderly, on the importance of not passing on the burdens of hardship to our future peer groups. Instead, let us nurture them as a proud nation, one that is respected by the global community while ensuring sustainable happiness. May this Hajj be a source of happiness and joy for all, especially our Sri Lankan Islamic brothers and sisters, as well as the Muslims across the world!",

        "date": "June 29, 2023 10:43 am",
        "content": "Presumed human remains were among the debris and evidence recovered from the seafloor where the doomed Titan submersibles remnants were found, the US Coast Guard said Wednesday. The remains were recovered within the wreckage of the submersible, the Coast Guard said in a news release  an announcement coming nearly a week after authorities determined the Titanic-bound vessel had imploded in the North Atlantic, killing all five men aboard. The presumed remains, which the military branch said will be analyzed by US medical professionals, were among the evidence from the submersible that arrived at a Canadian pier Wednesday. The company that owns the remotely operated vehicles that brought Titans remains to the surface, Pelagic Research Services, for now has successfully completed the offshore work, it told CNN. A white panel-like piece  taller than the two men guiding it onto land  and another similarly sized part with cords and wires draped with white tarp were among the debris taken off the anchor handling vessel Horizon Arctic at the Canadian Coast Guard pier in St. Johns, Newfoundland and Labrador, photos by The Canadian Press Paul Daly show. It was not immediately clear what those pieces were. Titan was made of carbon fiber and titanium and weighed 23,000 pounds, with room for only five adults, according to OceanGate Expeditions, which operated the craft as part of its offering for extreme tourists to get close to the century-old wreckage of the Titanic for 250,000 per person. Crew members have been working around the clock now for 10 days, through the physical and mental challenges of this operation, and are anxious to finish the mission and return to their loved ones, the company said in a statement. Pelagic Research Services deferred questions to the US Coast Guard, adding its team cannot comment on or provide any information related to the investigation into the Titans demise. The company will hold a news conference at its East Aurora, New York, operations base after our team has regrouped, it said. A Transportation Safety Board of Canada spokesperson declined to comment to CNN, saying more information about its investigation is forthcoming as warranted. The OceanGate submersible and its five passengers began their descent to the 111-year-old wreckage of the Titanic on the morning of June 18. But about an hour and 45 minutes into its dive, the cramped vessel lost contact with its mother ship and did not surface as expected, kicking off a massive, dayslong multinational search and rescue operation that captured the worlds attention. On Thursday, the US Coast Guard announced the vessel had suffered a catastrophic implosion that presumably killed all those aboard. The tail cone and other debris from the submersible were found by a remotely operated vehicle about 1,600 feet from the bow of the Titanic. Over the weekend, the military branch said it convened a Marine Board of Investigation to probe what caused the implosion and to offer possible recommendations to pursue civil or criminal sanctions as necessary. In its news release Wednesday, the Coast Guard said those working on the investigation board are collecting evidence and interviewing witnesses ahead of an expected public hearing for additional witness testimony. There is still a substantial amount of work to be done to understand the factors that led to the catastrophic loss of the Titan and help ensure a similar tragedy does not occur again, Capt. Jason Neubauer, who heads the investigative board, said Wednesday. Source - CNN - Agencies",

        "date": "June 29, 2023 01:33 pm",
        "content": "Sri Lanka is asking foreign investors in its international sovereign bonds to take a 30 haircut and is seeking similar concessions from holders of its other dollar-denominated bonds as it seeks to restructure its massive debt, its central bank governor said on Thursday. The government will also exchange treasury bills into long-term bonds as part of a domestic debt restructuring programme, Nandalal Weerasinghe told a press conference as he unveiled details of the long-awaited plan, which will cover part of the island nations 42 billion domestic debt. Sri Lanka is struggling with its worst financial crisis since its independence from Britain in 1948 after the countrys foreign exchange reserves hit record lows and triggered its first foreign debt default last year. Pledging to put its mammoth debt burden on a sustainable track, Sri Lanka locked down a 2.9 billion bailout from the IMF in March. The domestic restructuring is needed to help the country reach the IMF programme goal of reducing overall debt to 95 of GDP by 2032. Meanwhile, the government is also pushing forward with reworking its foreign debt with bondholders and bilateral creditors including China, Japan and India. Under the domestic debt revamp, holders of locally issued dollar-denominated bonds such as Sri Lanka Development Bonds (SLDBs) will be given three options, Weerasinghe said. The first would be treatment similar to investors in the countrys international sovereign bonds -- a 30 principal haircut with a 6-year maturity at a 4 interest rate, he said. We are asking foreign debt holders for a 30 haircut but that is still under discussion, Weerasinghe said. Sri Lanka currently has 12.5 billion in international sovereign bonds. Weerasinghe would not comment on current talks with bilateral creditors. Sri Lanka has set a goal of finalising debt restructuring talks by September to align with the first review of its IMF programme. China wants multilateral lenders like the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank to absorb some of the losses, which those institutions and many developed nations, notably the United States, are resisting. MORE INTERNATIONAL SUPPORT The domestic restructuring programme will be presented to parliament on Saturday for approval. Earlier on Thursday, the World Bank approved 700 million in budgetary and welfare support for the country, the biggest funding tranche for the island nation since the IMF deal in March. About 500 million of the funds will be allocated for budgetary support while the remaining 200 million will be for welfare support earmarked for those worst hit by the crisis. Sri Lankas cabinet approved the domestic debt programme at a special cabinet meeting on Wednesday, a source at the presidents office told Reuters. Domestic bondholders will be given two other options: - Similar treatment to that being proposed to bilateral dollar creditors: No principal haircut, with a 15-year maturity and 9-year grace period at 1.5 interest rate. - Exchange their holdings for local currency denominated instruments: No principal haircut with a 10-year maturity at the SLFR (Sri Lanka Standing Lending Facility Rate)  1 interest rate. Local currency bonds held by superannuation funds, including pension funds, will be replaced with new bonds which will have 9 interest, Weerasinghe added. But banks local currency bonds have been excluded from the scheme to avoid putting further strain on the financial sector. Sri Lankas sovereign U.S. dollar bonds were edging higher in early morning trade, with the bonds maturing in November 2025 and March 2024 gaining the most, 0.77 cents, by 0627 GMT, according to Tradeweb data.

In 2003 she grabbed the showbiz worlds attention by clinching pop princess Britney Spears in a lingering kiss on stage at that years MTV Music Video Awards. And she still displays the provocative streak for which she is both beloved and notorious. In January, news dropped of her forthcoming tour in a video nodding to her 1991 documentary Truth or Dare.

        "content": "One of the worlds most common artificial sweeteners is set to be declared a possible carcinogen next month by a leading global health body, according to two sources with knowledge of the process, pitting it against the food industry and regulators. Aspartame, used in products from Coca-Cola diet sodas to Mars Extra chewing gum and some Snapple drinks, will be listed in July as possibly carcinogenic to humans for the first time by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), the World Health Organizations (WHO) cancer research arm, the sources said The IARC ruling, finalised earlier this month after a meeting of the groups external experts, is intended to assess whether something is a potential hazard or not, based on all the published evidence. It does not take into account how much of a product a person can safely consume. This advice for individuals comes from a separate WHO expert committee on food additives, known as JECFA (the Joint WHO and Food and Agriculture Organizations Expert Committee on Food Additives), alongside determinations from national regulators. However, similar IARC rulings in the past for different substances have raised concerns among consumers about their use, led to lawsuits, and pressured manufacturers to recreate recipes and swap to alternatives. That has led to criticism that the IARCs assessments can be confusing to the public. JECFA, the WHO committee on additives, is also reviewing aspartame use this year. Its meeting began at the end of June and it is due to announce its findings on the same day that the IARC makes public its decision  on July 14. Since 1981, JECFA has said aspartame is safe to consume within accepted daily limits. For example, an adult weighing 60 kg (132 pounds) would have to drink between 12 and 36 cans of diet soda  depending on the amount of aspartame in the beverage  every day to be at risk. Its view has been widely shared by national regulators, including in the United States and Europe. An IARC spokesperson said both the IARC and JECFA committees findings were confidential until July, but added they were complementary, with IARCs conclusion representing the first fundamental step to understand carcinogenicity. The additives committee conducts risk assessment, which determines the probability of a specific type of harm (e.g., cancer) to occur under certain conditions and levels of exposure. However, industry and regulators fear that holding both processes at around the same time could be confusing, according to letters from U.S. and Japanese regulators seen by Reuters. We kindly ask both bodies to coordinate their efforts in reviewing aspartame to avoid any confusion or concerns among the public, Nozomi Tomita, an official from Japans Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, wrote in a letter dated March 27 to WHOs deputy director general, Zsuzsanna Jakab. The letter, reviewed by Reuters, also called for the conclusions of both bodies to be released on the same day, as is now happening. The Japanese mission in Geneva, where the WHO is based, did not respond to a request for comment. DEBATE The IARCs rulings can have huge impact. In 2015, its committee concluded that glyphosate is probably carcinogenic. Years later, even as other bodies like the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) contested this assessment, companies were still feeling the effects of the decision. Germanys Bayer in 2021 lost its third appeal against U.S. court verdicts that awarded damages to customers blaming their cancers on use of its glyphosate-based weedkillers. The IARCs decisions have also faced criticism for sparking needless alarm over hard to avoid substances or situations. It has previously put working overnight and consuming red meat into its probably cancer-causing class, and using mobile phones as possibly cancer-causing, similar to aspartame. IARC is not a food safety body and their review of aspartame is not scientifically comprehensive and is based heavily on widely discredited research, Frances Hunt-Wood, the secretary general of the International Sweeteners Association (ISA), said. The body, whose members include Mars Wrigley, a Coca-Cola unit and Cargill, said it had serious concerns with the IARC review, which may mislead consumers. Aspartame has been extensively studied for years. Last year, an observational study in France among 100,000 adults showed that people who consumed larger amounts of artificial sweeteners  including aspartame  had a slightly higher cancer risk. It followed a study from the Ramazzini Institute in Italy in the early 2000s, which reported that some cancers in mice and rats were linked to aspartame. However, the first study could not prove that aspartame caused the increased cancer risk, and questions have been raised about the methodology of the second study, including by EFSA, which assessed it. Aspartame is authorised for use globally by regulators who have reviewed all the available evidence, and major food and beverage makers have for decades defended their use of the ingredient. The IARC said it had assessed 1,300 studies in its June review. Recent recipe tweaks by soft drinks giant Pepsico demonstrate the struggle the industry has when it comes to balancing taste preferences with health concerns. Pepsico removed aspartame from sodas in 2015, bringing it back a year later, only to remove it again in 2020. Listing aspartame as a possible carcinogen is intended to motivate more research, said the sources close to the IARC, which will help agencies, consumers and manufacturers draw firmer conclusions. But it will also likely ignite debate once again over the IARCs role, as well as the safety of sweeteners more generally. Last month, the WHO published guidelines advising consumers not to use non-sugar sweeteners for weight control. The guidelines caused a furore in the food industry, which argues they can be helpful for consumers wanting to reduce the amount of sugar in their diet. Source  Reuters -Agencies",

        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe has issued instructions to ensure the effective execution of the Aswesuma social welfare initiative, aiming to leave no one behind. According to the Presidents Media Division (PMD), those who were unable to register previously for the welfare benefits scheme would be given the opportunity to do so during the month of August. Additionally, provisions have been put in place to allow the submission of written appeals and objections until July 10. Further, directives have been issued to all Divisional Secretariats to adhere to the governments decisions, further emphasizing the commitment to upholding transparency and equity. In a statement, the PMD said with an overwhelming response, the Divisional Secretariats across the island have received a staggering 3.7 million applications for the Aswesuma social security benefits program. Following a comprehensive survey, a total of 3.3 million applications have been carefully selected, marking a significant milestone in the programs implementation. Out of the selected applicants, a list comprising 2 million names has been released to the public, designating them as eligible beneficiaries, pending appeals and objections. The PMD noted that the selection process was diligently overseen by a three-member committee at the Divisional Secretariat level, with final approval granted by the District Secretary. This meticulous approach ensured that deserving candidates were rightfully chosen to benefit from the program. For individuals who believe they qualify for the Aswesuma welfare scheme but have not fond their names on the published list, a window of opportunity has been provided to file appeals until July 10. Furthermore, if any details of individuals who should not receive social welfare benefits are identified in the public list, a mechanism for anonymous complaints has also been established. Appeals and objections can be submitted in writing to the divisional secretariats, who have been duly informed of the process. In the coming week, the public can anticipate the release of a separate list pertaining to the payment of allowances for various assistance programs running alongside the relief benefit program. These include 456,806 elderly allowances, 19,496 kidney patients allowances, 46,857 disability allowances, and 523,159 public assistance program allowances. The disclosure of this information will provide clarity and transparency regarding the distribution of benefits across multiple social support initiatives. Lastly, an annual opportunity is extended to individuals who were unable to register for the Aswesuma Social Welfare Benefits Program, as well as those who wish to join the program anew.",

        "content": "The Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) says it has settled accumulated arrears of approximately Rs. 4 billion due for customers of rooftop solar units. Accordingly, all due arrears up to April 2023 has now been settled, the CEBs Additional General Manager, Eng. G.I.D.H.K. Ranasinghe said in a media release issued today. During 2022, CEB says it was unable to settle the payment for rooftop solar customers in total due to severe financial difficulties faced by CEB mainly due to non-availability of a cost-reflective tariff. However, with the implementation of a cost-reflective tariff on 15 February 2023, the utility has managed to commence settlement of monthly bills from internal cash generation and accumulated arrears by raising loans from financial institutions despite the fact that settlement of previous debt is not included in the tariff. CEB is happy that now we managed to settle all due arrears up to April 2023. Electricity customers of Sri Lanka have installed about 700 MW of rooftop solar energy systems which is sizable compared with the day peak of the country is only 2700 MW including Rooftop solar. Rooftop solar units have immensely contributed to increasing the renewable energy share of the country, according to the CEB.",

        "content": "Finance Secretary Mahinda Siriwardana says foreign debt restructuring will not be feasible without restructuring domestic debt. Joining a special media briefing organized by the Presidential Media Centre on Thursday (June 29) to discuss the Domestic Debt Optimization (DDO), the Finance Secretary said the government prioritizes the safeguarding of both the banking system and the Employees Provident Fund (EPF). Siriwardana said it is essential to disseminate information widely about these programs, particularly reaching out to impoverished individuals in remote villages who may be unaware or unable to participate actively. As Sri Lanka has entered into a program with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the Finance Secretary said failing to pursue debt restructuring will have repercussions on this program. The consequences for the future of our country under such circumstances are unimaginable. Therefore, it is vital to recognize the sensitivity of this issue and address it accordingly. This restructuring involves both domestic and foreign loans. Although the foreign debt restructuring program is underway, significant emphasis has been placed on prioritizing the completion of the domestic debt restructuring program in a timely manner. The Finance Secretary went on to note the importance of taking action to educate and inform the public about the current situation. Many questions are being raised, including concerns about the potential collapse of the banking system and the adverse impact on the country. This is a distressing situation for me personally, as the nation is facing significant challenges that are yet to be resolved. It is imperative to implement programs that can help overcome these challenges.",

        "content": "China has invested a lot in Sri Lanka in recent years and Sri Lanka looks forward to expanding the mutually beneficial partnership, Ali Sabry, Sri Lankas minister of foreign affairs, told the media during his visit to China. Speaking at a press briefing at the Sri Lankan Embassy in Beijing on Wednesday afternoon, Sabry reviewed the countrys relationship with China and how it has helped Sri Lanka to develop its economy and trade. The foreign minister also refuted the hype in some Western media reports, which have claimed that Chinas Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) has pushed Sri Lanka into a debt trap. I think some media outlets use it to advance their agendas Chinese investment was and has been very, very important to us. Sri Lanka had been depressed for 26 years. No investment was forthcoming. Everybody was adopting a vacant approach, but the Chinese investment came and propelled the growth in Sri Lanka. Therefore, we are very grateful for that, Sabry told the Global Times at the press briefing. In Sri Lanka, across the party line, everybody has an excellent relationship with China, the minister said. Looking at the last decade or two, most of the investments in Sri Lanka have come from China, ranging from industrial facilities and technological support to agriculture and education, he said, noting that Chinese investment is very important not only for the growth of Sri Lanka but also for many other developing countries. Regarding the countrys economic problems, the foreign minister said there were multiple factors including bad policies, the pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine conflict. We are not going to blame somebody else for that and we need to take ownership of that. We had serious policy deficiencies. We are now addressing those issues, overcoming them, and getting back to a sustainable way forward, Sabry said. The foreign minister said that the country is stabilizing the economy and is now recovering. The most important phase now is the growth phase, for which Chinese investment is very important, he said. China has a big role to play in helping Sri Lanka to address these issues, he added. Sabry said that there is a lot Sri Lanka can do together with China, while learning from Chinas growth. He also said what China has achieved in recent decades has been unbelievable, adding that taking 800 million people out of poverty is a great achievement. For me and my country, China has been a friend. China has been a partner in progress, and it will continue to be a partner in progress in the future, Sabry said. Source: Global Times",

The deal, subject to approval by the IMF board in July, comes after an eight-month delay and offers some respite to Pakistan, which is battling an acute balance of payments crisis and falling foreign exchange reserves. The 3 billion funding, spread over nine months, is higher than expected for Pakistan. The country was awaiting the release of the remaining 2.5 billion from a 6.5 billion bailout package agreed in 2019, which expired on Friday. The new stand-by arrangement builds on the 2019 programme, IMF official Nathan Porter said in a statement on Thursday, adding that Pakistans economy had faced several challenges in recent times, including devastating floods last year and commodity price hikes following the war in Ukraine. Despite the authorities efforts to reduce imports and the trade deficit, reserves have declined to very low levels. Liquidity conditions in the power sector also remain acute, Porter said in a statement. Given these challenges, the new arrangement would provide a policy anchor and a framework for financial support from multilateral and bilateral partners in the period ahead.

        "content": "The Committee on Public Finance (COPF) is meeting today for the third consecutive day for constructive discussions on the proposed Domestic Debt Optimization (DDO) plan and to reach a consensus. During the second session of discussions on the Domestic Debt Optimization (DDO) plan on Thursday, the COPF chairman MP Dr. Harsha de Silva said the committee looked into the concerns about the impact of the DDO plan on the superannuation funds. The banking system is excluded from the DDO plan taking as it already contributes to the Treasury and the economy through taxes of over 50. The government says this move aims to safeguard the Treasury and to ensure the safety of the 57 million public and private bank deposits in the country. For the second session of discussions on the DDO program, the COPF invited all creditors including banks, superannuation funds, and insurance funds to hear their opinions and concerns. Accordingly, concerns have been raised about burden falling on superannuation funds, especially the Employees Provident Fund (EPF) without considering the consent of depositors, COPF chairman said in a tweet. Although banks are excluded from the DDO plan due to existing stress and non-performing loans, the COPF chairman said the EPF and the ETF, which carry most of the burden, face potential opportunity loss and lacks a say in the decisions impacting peoples life savings. This raises questions about equity and transparency, he added. The participants of the meeting have acknowledged the urgency of passing the DDO plan without delay for the success of the IMF program and economic growth. The COPF chairman went on to note that however, there is no contingency plan in the event foreign debt relief and primary targets are not met. This leaves the EPF and ETF exposed to additional burden without alternative solutions. The creditors including banks and insurance funds have meanwhile expressed relief over the proposed DDO plan. Dr. de Silva noted that the exclusion of banks allows them to aggressively participate in the market, supporting businesses, especially the hard-hit micro small and medium enterprises (MSME) sector. In his Twitter thread, the COPF chairman appreciated the tireless efforts of Central Bank and Treasury officials in stabilizing and reviving the Sri Lankan economy. But it is crucial to address the concerns of superannuation funds EPF and ETF depositors and to ensure consent and explore a more balanced burden-sharing approach. Meanwhile, non-COPF members are expected to be briefed about the DDO plan for better understanding and fruitful debates in the parliament this weekend.",

If individually you dont like it, then collectively why do you want to have this tag on you? So lets get out of it. The President also mentioned that a Climate Prosperity Plan was launched in November, which means that more resources are required, partially from the Government and partly from other investments, including private investments. As a result, the President stated that if Sri Lanka abandons the program, the country would immediately forfeit the 700 million that the World Bank is set to provide the country, and the second review would be a failure. Sri Lanka in future will start playing a more active role in the area of debt and climate resilience and the President expressed confidence that Sri Lanka can make it with what it has got. The President further said that Sri Lanka has a growth agenda which the Government has placed up for discussion with everyone involved. However, he said that completing the debt restructuring is critical. Wickremesinghe noted that he had already met with members of the Cabinet, Bankers, Chamber of Commerce representatives, and trade union representatives and held discussions. The President also expressed confidence about Sri Lanka getting out of the present crisis, while looking ahead for a far more competitive economy. He noted that Sri Lanka would be making an application in the next month to join the RCEP, the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership that puts Sri Lanka into the whole Southeast East Asian market. As a start off in building a competitive economy, discussion will commence with the EU and India to strengthen trade agreements, the President added.",

        "date": "June 30, 2023 02:12 pm",
        "content": "Prime Minister Dinesh Gunawardena says that despite the Western countries continuing to smear the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) as a debt trap, China is focusing on its own development path by moving forward step by step while helping other countries to create success stories of their own. Joining a discussion with the CGTN news agency, the PM further mentioned that China has proven to the world that many developmental challenges can be solved. Meanwhile, he also expressed that China is a major contributor to global economic growth, and the BRI has provided solid foundations for the lives of billions of people worldwide. Responding to a question on his take on the Western countries accusation against China of using debt to gain influence, Gunawardena stated that this debate has been going on over the years, adding that China is a nation economically powerful, which cannot be ignored by any country in the world today. Of course, this debate has been going on over the years. But China, in my mind, is a great nation, a nation economically powerful, which cannot be ignored by any country in the world today. China has invested even in the US, the Sri Lankan PM emphasized, stating that the Belt and Road development plan was an important role in new economic development for the whole of Asia. He said China has shown that it can deliver to overcome many other issues prevalent in the world such as poverty, adding that millions in China, in the last few years, have been brought out of poverty. It was not just a change, but a historic change that contributes to all others, and also as a model for others to see this can be done. China has been helping all countries across the continents, Gunawardena said, expressing that they have been working with key countries of the Western world. There was a time when those countries were reluctant to make deals with China. But things changed, he added. Despite the ongoing debates, China is moving forward step by step on the development path, and also helping other countries of the world to make their countries and economies a success story. To make countries success you need investment. In addition, PM Gunawardena asserted that China is a great contributor to this new world economy that is growing, highlighting that the BRI is a strong base for covering the life of few billions of people in the world.",

        "content": "The Committee on Parliamentary Business has decided to debate the Domestic Debt Optimization (DDO) program in parliament tomorrow (July 01). The debate will be held from 9.30 a.m. to 7.30 p.m. Members of Parliament are expected to vote on the proposed DDO following the conclusion of the debate if a division is requested. Although it was earlier speculated that the parliament would be convened on Sunday (July 02), the party leaders have decided otherwise. Meanwhile, it was decided to hold next weeks parliamentary sittings on July 5,6 and 7. The special parliamentary session scheduled for July 01 is being convened pursuant to a gazette notification issued by Speaker Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena after taking into account a request made by PM Dinesh Gunawardena. The Cabinet of Ministers on Wednesday (June 28) approved the proposed domestic debt restructuring strategy for restoring sovereign debt sustainability. Meanwhile, the members of Committee on Public Finance (COPF) met today for the third consecutive day for constructive discussions on the proposed DDO plan and to reach a consensus. The COPF invited all creditors including commercial banks, superannuation funds including the EPF and ETF, and insurance funds to hear their opinions and concerns. The COPF is carefully analyzing the concerns raised on the possible burden falling on the superannuation funds especially on the EPF, as a result of domestic debt restructuring. The government has excluded the banking system from the DDO plan as it already contributes to the Treasury and the economy through taxes of over 50. This move aims to safeguard the Treasury and to ensure the safety of the 57 million public and private bank deposits in the country.",

        "date": "June 30, 2023 03:51 pm",
        "content": "If youve even a mild interest in luxury handbags, youve likely heard of the Chanel classic flap bag or the Hermes Birkin. But youve perhaps not heard of the Microscopic Handbag by MSCHF. At less than 0.03 inches wide, the teensy, tiny Microscopic Handbag by New York-based art collective MSCHF is so small that the human eye can hardly see it when its atop a fingertip. And, yet, it still sold for more than 60,000 at an auction this week. Neon green and made via 3D printer using 2-photon polymerization printing methods, the bag  which is modeled after Louis Vuittons famed OnTheGo tote  is viewable through a microscope. Upon closer inspection via microscope, one can see the LV monogram clearly on the bags face. MSCHFs small ware, which more technically is 657 by 222 by 700 microns, was put up for auction by Joopiter, an online auction house founded by Pharrell Williams. According to Joopiter, the item sold for 63,750. Notably, the producer, rapper and Happy singer is currently Louis Vuittons creative director of menswear, but was reportedly not contacted by MSCHF when they created the bag in the brands likeness, according to the New York Times. Kevin Wiesner, the chief creative officer of MSCHF, told the publication that because Williams loves big hats, we made him an incredibly small bag. Wiesner also claimed that he believed the bag to be a funny object because it derives from something rigorously functional. But it has basically become jewelry, he explained. MSCHF did not respond to the Guardians request for comment on the sale or if they have plans to make more microscopic accessories. In the auction post for the tiny tote, MSCHF dubbed their creation as both smaller than a grain of salt and the final word in bag miniaturization. As a once-functional object like a handbag becomes smaller and smaller its object status becomes steadily more abstracted until it is purely a brand signifier. Previous small leather handbags have still required a hand to carry them  they become dysfunctional, inconveniences to their wearer. Microscopic Handbag takes this to its full logical conclusion. A practical object is boiled down into jewelry, all of its putative function evaporated; for luxury objects, useability is the angels share, the brand wrote. Begun in 2016, MSCHF has become best known for its inventive projects that double as both cultural commentary and exclusive collectors items. Arguably, one of their more famous drops in recent months include their Big Red Boot, which can best be described as cartoon costumery come to life. Source - The Guardian -Agencies",

        "content": "Sri Lankas headline inflation, as measured by the Year-on-Year (Y-o-Y) change in the Colombo Consumer Price Index (CCPI), eased to 12.0 in June 2023, compared to the previous month. The CCPI-based inflation was calculated as 25.2 for the month of May 2023. According to the latest report issued by the Department of Census  Statistics (DCS), the Y-o-Y inflation of Food Group dropped to 4.1 in June 2023 from 21.5 in May 2023. The Y-o-Y inflation of Non-Food Group decreased to 16.2 this month from 27.0 in March 2023. For the month of April 2023, on Y-o-Y basis, the contribution to the inflation by food commodities was 1.42. The contribution of Non-Food Group was meanwhile recorded as 10.59. The department said this decrease in the contribution of Food and Non-Food groups to the inflation was mainly due to the increases in value change in groups of housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels, restaurants  hotels, clothing  footwear, furnishing household equipment and routine household maintenance, health, miscellaneous goods and services, education, recreation and culture, communication, education, alcoholic beverages, and tobacco.

Chaired by MP Dr. Harsha de Silva, the COPF met today for the third consecutive day for constructive talks on the domestic debt restructuring strategy. During its discussions on the Domestic Debt Optimization (DDO) plan on Thursday, the committee looked into the concerns about the impact of the DDO plan on the superannuation funds. The banking system is excluded from the DDO plan taking as it already contributes to the Treasury and the economy through taxes of over 50.

For its discussions on the DDO program, the COPF had invited all creditors including banks, superannuation funds, and insurance funds to hear their opinions and concerns. Concerns had been raised about the burden falling on superannuation funds, especially the Employees Provident Fund (EPF) without considering the consent of depositors. Although banks are excluded from the DDO plan due to existing stress and non-performing loans, the COPF chairman said the EPF and the ETF, which carry most of the burden, face potential opportunity loss and lacks a say in the decisions impacting peoples life savings. The COPF earlier said the EPF and ETF are exposed to additional burden without alternative solutions as there is no contingency plan in the event foreign debt relief and primary targets are not met. Meanwhile, a full-day debate on the proposed domestic debt restructuring strategy will be held in the parliament tomorrow (July 01) after which the lawmakers will cast their votes for the adoption of the program.

        "date": "June 30, 2023 05:22 pm",
        "content": "The Central Bank (CBSL) says the countrys trade deficit in May 2023 widened, compared to a year ago, for the first time since February 2022 while the cumulative trade deficit remained modest so far during 2023. In its report on the External Sector Performance for May 2023, the Central Bank said the deficit in the merchandise trade account amounted to USD 447 million in May 2023, compared to USD 403 million recorded in May 2022, recording a year-on-year expansion for the first time since February 2022. The cumulative deficit in the trade account from January to May 2023 was USD 1,926 million, a sizeable decline from USD 3,528 million recorded over the same period in 2022. The earnings from merchandise exports meanwhile declined by 2.7 in May 2023 on a year-on-year basis, to USD 1,019 million, while increasing notably compared to April 2023. The CBSL explained that the decline in earnings from industrial exports mainly contributed to the decline in export earnings amidst improved agricultural exports. The department says the cumulative export earnings from January to May 2023 were recorded at USD 4,866 million, marking a decline of 7.7 over the same period in the last year. Simultaneously, the expenditure on merchandise imports increased marginally to USD 1,466 million in May 2023, compared to US dollars 1,451 million in May 2022, recording the first year-on-year increase since February 2022. The increase in expenditure on consumer goods contributed to the increase in import expenditure amidst the decline in expenditure on intermediate and investment goods imports. The ongoing recovery in economic activities mainly contributed to the increase in import expenditure while the gradual relaxation of import restrictions could generate higher import expenditure in the period ahead. The CBSL says the cumulative import expenditure from January 2023 to May 2023 declined by 22.8 over the corresponding period in 2022. Meanwhile, the workers remittances increased notably to USD 480 million during May 2023 in comparison to USD 304 million in May 2022 and USD 454 million in April 2023. Based on the provisional data, total departures for foreign employment from January to May 2023 and departures in May 2023 amounted to 122,350 and 26,458, respectively. Departure levels in the first five months of 2023 were broadly similar to that in 2022. The annual departures for 2022 were around 311,056.",

        "date": "June 30, 2023 05:27 pm",
        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe has urged business leaders to educate their employees on Domestic Debt Optimization (DDO), a crucial step aimed to ensure that individuals and industries comprehend the significance of this financial maneuver. The President made this remark while addressing members of the Chambers, business leaders and unions regarding the DDO, during meetings held yesterday (29) at the Presidential Secretariat, the Presidents Media Division (PMD) reported. Furthermore, President Wickremesinghe has mentioned that the stakeholders can grasp the nuances of the restructuring and gauge its influence on their livelihoods by engaging in widespread explanations. Wickremesinghe also noted that the foremost effect of this restructuring endeavour is the anticipated reduction in interest rates, providing a glimmer of hope for individuals burdened by financial obligations. While the exact timeline remains uncertain, experts predict a noticeable decline in interest rates within a matter of months, the PMD said. The President said, I think best is for you all to go out and explain what this debt restructuring means to you all and to the workforce. I think thats what you all should do and if you can keep that momentum in the next few days, it will be very helpful. This is about the best that we can achieve. With this comes the fact that our interest rates will come down. Its a matter of months before it comes down. Secondly, the development assistance will start, which will be a boost to a part of the construction sector. Moreover, the President said as part of this restructuring, an injection of development assistance is on the horizon, poised to breathe new life into the construction sector. This infusion of support has the potential to stimulate growth, create employment opportunities, and invigorate the overall economy. Meanwhile, during the meeting with trade union representatives, President Ranil Wickremesinghe emphasized the importance of implementing the Domestic Debt Optimization program. He warned that failure to do so could lead to a potential increase in interest rates for loans obtained by small businesses. The President also expressed concerns about the possibility of the dollars resurgence, given the strengthening of the rupee. He emphasized that domestic debt optimization must be conducted simultaneously with foreign debt optimization to mitigate this risk. President Wickremesinghe assured the trade union representatives that the law guarantees the continuation of the 9 annual interest provided to beneficiaries under the Employees Provident Fund. He urged them not to harbour any doubts regarding future benefits. Following are excerpts of the discussion with members of Chambers and the business community; Dr. Nandalal Weerasinghe  Central Bank Governor: There have been a lot of concerns about banks recently, saying that bank deposits will be affected. There will be an impact on the banking system. So in our discussions, we ensured the banking system stability. Next is the protection of all bank deposits. This is going to have a huge social impact compared to the superannuation funds. So there is a very reasonable and fair solution. Our argument is that banks have already made a huge contribution to the Treasury in terms of 50 taxation and their contribution to the economy in terms of debt moratoriums, and state loan provisioning, which has already been affected. As a result, we wanted to exclude the banking system or deposit-taking institutions from restructuring their treasury bonds. Treasury bills obviously have no impact at all as was already announced by the Central Bank. Treasury bills will be restructured. On the superannuation funds, it is also a fair solution where we would be able to assure that they will receive the interest or return of 9 every year. Next several years they will be assured of a 9 return as well as no reduction in their balances. No re-statement of balances. The current balance would be protected. They will continue to get a 9 return going forward. And those treasury bonds would be restructured and would be exchanged for new bonds. That will be launched on the first working day on Tuesday (04) morning. There will be a launching notice. From there that will be the cut-off date. Any bonds held by superannuation funds will be exchanged including EPF, ETF and all superannuation funds. There are a number of private-sector superannuation funds. Those will be restructured. The main justification why only superannuation funds is basically because they are paying their liable 14 tax compared to the banking sectors 50 insurance. At least 30 of the corporate are paying 30 income tax. Any income out of Treasury bonds or interest income are paid back to the government in terms of taxes. However, superannuation funds are paying only 14 which is a concessionary rate. Still, they can continue to enjoy that 14 if they participate in the bond exchange. Otherwise, they have the option to go for higher tax rates. Then obviously they will not be better off. So, it is up to the superannuation funds to decide on their choice. We would expect that choice will be indicated when we complete the bond exchange within the month of July. Then the government will get a big relief in terms of their liquidity. And the key instrument is that in bond exchange, there will be a five-year grace period during which interest will only be paid for exchange bonds. And then maturity starts from 2032 to 2038 on a gradual basis and yearly basis. Any new bonds will be traded in the market and new issuance will be under a new series. So those will continue as usual. And then this will provide a huge relief for the government in terms of its liquidity position. There will be interest payment relief. So that fiscal consolidation and fiscal position will be relieved. From our side, the Central Bank, our involvement, and interest is to protect the financial stability on one hand and the banking sector and deposit-taking institutions. On the other hand, as the custodian of the EPF, we wanted to get the best-optimized deal for EPF holders and superannuation funds. We expect the DDO to be submitted to Parliament and discussed at the committee stage. And then on Saturday (01), hopefully, it will be approved by Parliament. Then the launch will happen from Tuesday onwards. Bingumal Tewarathanthi  Chairman of SLBA: The Sri Lanka Business Association (SLBA) welcomes the classification or excluding banks from the DDO. But when you look at it, with the current proposal, we can reach the Gross Financing Needs (GFN) targets, and thats critical. And also this is a huge debt relief from a cash outflow perspective. The only challenge, the way I look at it, from a revenue standpoint and expenditure standpoint, is that the government will have a serious concern in terms of paying interest for the domestic debts. So the revenue broadening would be critical for the government. We have to increase tax files. I dont think we can run with the current tax base and reach the targets. Vish Govindasamy  Chairman, Ceylon Chamber of Commerce: From the private sector and the Ceylon Chambers point of view, I think this is probably the best thing that could have happened, especially protecting the banking system, because otherwise, with the already struggling economy, we would have struggled with the banks having to deal with other issues. But having said that, hopefully, the banks will now start making cheaper funds available to the private sector. I think that has not been coming forth, so we really look forward to that happening. This way investment can continue. I think everything came to a standstill during the last 18 to 24 months. So for the economy to move forward, we need cheaper funds to come into the private sector. Sharad Amalean  Chairman Joint Apparel Association Forum: I would like to congratulate the government for having pulled this off. Its definitely a big relief. Mr. President, as you came in, you would have seen a smile on everyones faces. And I think the question we have to ask you is, how can we help? What help does the government need from us? What are the things that we should do and not do, and what would you like us to take back from this meeting? Buwanekabahu Perera  Secretary General CEO, the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce (CCC): We believe that bringing in some kind of relief for the capital of interest payments that we are making right now, will definitely add value and promote the investments and continuity of the private sector because right now we see many small, medium and also the large-scale private sector closing down and looking at various other markets to move in. However, we will have to look at retaining them internally because we have seen a number of large companies that have been in the trade for more than 30, or 40 years, closing down. So we will have to address something here, particularly when you look at the energy sector. We will have to give some kind of solution there and restructuring of the CEB must take a primary role within the next couple of months. This will give some consolation to the private sector for them to continue their business in an affordable and internationally competitive manner.",

        "content": "Minister of Fisheries Douglas Devananda said that President Ranil Wickremesinghe has devised a planned program to address the issues faced by fishermen. Under the theme of Collective Path to a Stable Country, Devananda made these remarks during a press briefing held at the Presidential Media Centre yesterday (29), the Presidents Media Division (PMD) reported. The Minister emphasized the notable progress observed in all sectors of the country since President Wickremesinghe assumed office. He further highlighted that a comprehensive program is currently being implemented to resolve the challenges encountered by fishermen. The objective is to enhance the fishing industry and make necessary amendments to existing laws that align with future requirements, the PMD said. Douglas Devananda also added that the laws pertaining to the fishing sector are outdated. Consequently, a draft containing new legislation will be presented to the Cabinet before the years end. Following that, it will be submitted to the parliament for approval, according to the PMD. Addressing the issue of Indian fishermen engaging in illegal fishing activities within Sri Lankan waters, the Minister expressed concern over the adverse impact on the marine resources and the livelihood of local fishermen. He expressed hope that this matter will receive attention during the Presidents forthcoming visit to India, it added. Significant sea-related projects are already underway in the Northern Province, with the objective of implementing these projects on approximately 5,000 acres. Currently, projects related to water resources have been executed in an area spanning around 1,500 acres. A substantial number of investors have shown interest in participating, and efforts have been made to involve underprivileged individuals in these projects to uplift their living standards. Furthermore, the President has addressed not only domestic but also international forums regarding the resolution of issues faced by the Tamil community and the need for reconciliation. While proposals for addressing the issues of the Tamil people are already outlined in the Constitution, the 13th Amendment provides an avenue for potential solutions. President Ranil Wickremesinghe is acknowledged as the sole leader capable of resolving the countrys issues, having already provided solutions to many existing challenges. Efforts are presently underway to resolve land disputes affecting the Tamil community, and steps have been taken to release individuals who were previously detained as political prisoners. The Minister called upon Tamil parties to actively contribute towards resolving these issues, cautioning against engaging in actions solely driven by political motives, as they hinder the prospects of resolving problems faced by the Tamil community, according to the PMD. Regarding the Express Pearl incident, he said that compensation has been provided to 15,032 fishermen directly affected by this disaster and 4,882 fishermen who have been indirectly affected. A total of Rs. 3,068 million has been allocated for this purpose in four phases. He added that compensation has already been disbursed based on information gathered from the Kalutara, Colombo, and Gampaha districts. The Ministry urges any additional affected individuals to come forward and provide their relevant information to the authorities, the PMD mentioned.",

        "title": "Parliamentary debate on domestic debt restructuring program today",
        "date": "July 1, 2023 06:49 am",
        "content": "A full-day special parliamentary session is taking place today during which the lawmakers are debating the domestic debt optimization (DDO) plan aimed at debt sustainability and economic recovery. The Members of Parliament will vote on the proposed DDO strategy if a division is requested following the conclusion of the debate from 9.30 a.m. to 7.30 p.m. Upon approval, the plan will be presented to the public on July 04. Superannuation funds EPF (Employees Provident Fund) and ETF (Employees Trust Fund) have been given 21 days until July 25 to review and agree or disagree with the proposed plan. Ahead of the parliamentary debate on the DDO plan, the government announced a five-day cooling-off period for commercial banks to prevent panic in the market, to maintain stability and to avoid unnecessary volatility. The Cabinet of Ministers on Wednesday (June 28) unanimously approved the proposed sovereign domestic debt restructuring strategy for restoring sovereign debt sustainability. Following two days of extensive discussions on the domestic debt restructuring strategy and its impact, the Committee on Public Finance (COPF), chaired by MP Dr. Harsha de Silva on Friday (June 30), gave its approval for the proposed plan, with amendments binding the Finance Ministry to the proposed plan, ensuring adherence to the approved concept paper and addressing concerns about potential deviations. The Central Bank governor, Finance Ministry secretary and its officials, creditors including banks, superannuation funds EPFETF and insurance funds had been invited to the COPF sessions to discuss the matter at length and to hear their views. In response to questions on the DDOs impact on superannuation funds EPF, ETF and the guarantee given to ensure 9 interest rates, the Central Bank governor Dr. Nandalal Weerasinghe assured that their calculations indicate no net present value loss to the EPF. However, COPF chairman has advocated for legislating a minimum return, as done in the 1958 EPF Act. Further, concerns were raised about the burden falling on the EPF, the largest superannuation fund in the country, without the consent of the depositors. The COPF chairman, Dr. Harsha de Silva said the committee members called for balanced burden sharing among all creditors, not entirely on the superannuation funds, in order to uphold equity in the DDO. Meanwhile, COPF members also raised concerns about the governments commitment to the proposed plan and adherence to the principles of the resolution. Finance Ministry officials acknowledging these concerns, pledged to strengthen the Fiscal Management Responsibility Act (FMRA) for compliance. Domestic debt restructuring is a key condition in the International Monetary Fund (IMF) program, through which a bailout package of USD 3 billion was approved for Sri Lanka in March 2023. The IMF program unlocks more help from international funding agencies. Accordingly, the World Bank, earlier this week, approved USD 700 million in financing as budgetary and welfare support for Sri Lanka. After defaulting on its foreign debt for the time in May 2022, Sri Lanka has been working to get the economy back on track and to meet the conditions set by the IMF. Sri Lanka aims to restructure its sovereign domestic debt before the second IMF review in September 2023 as the release of second tranche of the bailout package due in October would require notable progress on debt restructuring. The island nation received the first tranche to the tune of USD 330 million in March soon after the IMF Board approved the 48-month Extended Fund Facility (EFF). President Ranil Wickremesinghe earlier this week said Sri Lankas total public debt, both domestic and foreign, amounted to USD 83.7 billion at the end of 2022. Out of this amount, the foreign debt stood at USD 41.5 billion, and domestic debt at USD 42.1 billion. Central Bank governor Dr. Nandalal Weerasinghe has ensured the exclusion of commercial banks from the domestic debt restructuring plan, which focuses on restructuring treasury bills and bonds under the Central Bank, along with the superannuation funds EPF and ETF. He said the move intends to protect the banking sector as its collapse would lead to catastrophic consequences. Treasury bonds of superannuation funds would be exchanged for longer-maturity treasury bonds from 2027 to 2038, with a step-down from a structure of 12 until 2025 and 9 until maturity. To encourage the participation of superannuation funds, those that do not take part would be subject to an income tax rate of 30 versus the current 14. Sovereign domestic debt restructuring is expected to ease the negotiations with external creditors like China and private institutions and ensure them the burden is shared while minimizing the impact on the financial sector. The strategy should be designed to anticipate, minimize, and manage its impact on the domestic economy and financial system. Casting the net wide across claims can help boost participation in the restructuring by lowering the relief sought from each creditor group. Fiscal costs might have to be incurred in domestic debt restructuring due to the need to maintain financial stability, to ensure the functioning of the banking system or to replenish pension savings. -with inputs from agencies",

        "date": "July 1, 2023 10:41 am",
        "content": "At least 25 people were killed and eight others injured after a bus caught fire overnight on an expressway in western India on Saturday, police said. The bus was travelling to the city of Pune when it hit a pole and overturned after midnight, causing its diesel tank to catch fire, senior police officer Baburao Mahamuni said. There were about 30-35 people in the bus. Twenty-five people have died and eight others are injured, he said. The injured, including the bus driver, have been admitted to a hospital near the site of the crash in Maharashtra state, about 400km east of Indias financial capital Mumbai. Police said they had launched an inquiry into the crash. The priority at this moment is to identify the bodies and hand them over to their family members, local media quoted police superintendent Sunil Kadasane as saying. Images showed the bus engulfed in flames and later the charred remains of the vehicle overturned on the highway. Three children were among the dead, a police officer told reporters. Deeply saddened by the devastating bus mishap in Buldhana, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Twitter. My thoughts and prayers are with the families of those who lost their lives. May the injured recover soon. Maharashtra Chief Minister Eknath Shinde said he felt deep grief over the accident and pledged compensation of 500,000 rupees (US6,100) to the families of those killed. Accidents are common on Indias vast network of roads, which are poorly maintained and notoriously dangerous. The main causes are excessive speed, not wearing helmets  sales of two-wheelers far outstrip those of cars  and not using seat belts. India accounts for 11 per cent of the global road death toll despite having just one per cent of the worlds vehicles, according to a World Bank report released in 2021. The same report estimated 150,000 car crash fatalities in India annually, or one person every four minutes. It added that road crashes cost the Indian economy around US75 billion each year, with medical expenses and loss of income driving many accident survivors into poverty. In May, at least 21 people died when a bus veered off a bridge in India, reportedly after the driver fell asleep at the wheel. And last October, at least 31 people were killed after a bus carrying wedding guests veered off the road and fell into a deep gorge in northern India. -Agencies",

        "content": "Sri Lankan government has condemned the burning of the Holy Quran, the sacred text of Islam, outside a mosque in Sweden amidst Eid al-Adha celebrations earlier this week. In a statement issued on Friday (June 30) with regard to the incident, the Sri Lankan government said, The exercise of the freedom of expression carries with it the responsibility to exercise this right in a manner that respects the rights of others and to ensure that it does not give license to create divisions and hatred based on religion. The statement further noted that in the interest of national and international peace and harmony, all countries and individuals have an obligation to prevent acts of religious intolerance and hatred which lead to polarization among communities. On Wednesday (June 28), an Iraqi named Salwan Momika, who is said to be living in Sweden, set fire to a copy of Islams holy book outside the central mosque in Stockholm, sparking anger among Muslims across the world. Swedish police had initially granted permission for the protest to take place, but the demonstrator was later charged with agitation against an ethnic or national group. This risks angering Turkey, where an overwhelming majority of the population is Muslim, as Sweden bids to join NATO. Sweden had sought NATO membership in the wake of Russias invasion of Ukraine in 2022. However, alliance member Turkey held up the process, accusing Sweden of harbouring terrorists and demanding their extradition.",

        "title": "Indian nurse who delivered more than 10,000 babies...",
        "date": "July 1, 2023 01:55 pm",
        "content": "A recently retired Indian nurse named Kathija Bibi, who received a government award for overseeing more than 10,000 successful deliveries, has looked back on the changes she saw in attitudes towards womens healthcare in her 33-year-long career. Nurses and midwives are vital for Indias healthcare system, but it faces challenges due to high demand and limited resources. I am proud that not a single one of the 10,000 babies I delivered died on my watch, says Kathija Bibi, 60, who counts this as the highlight of her career. The states health minister, Ma. Subramanian, told the BBC that Khatija recently received a government award as no death was recorded during her years of service. During the three decades she worked at a government health centre in the southern state of Tamil Nadu, India has transformed from a country with a high maternal mortality rate to one that is closer to the global average. She says she has also witnessed positive changes in peoples attitudes to girls being born, and towards having fewer children. Kathija was pregnant herself when she began working in 1990. I was seven months pregnant yet I was helping other women. I returned to work after a short maternity break of two months, Kathija recalls. I know how anxious women are when they go into labour, so making them comfortable and confident is my first priority. Kathija, who retired in June, radiates calm composure. Her clinic - in the predominantly rural town of Villupuram, 150km (93 miles) south of Chennai city - is not equipped to do Caesarean sections so if she detected any complications, she immediately sent pregnant women to the district hospital. Kathijas inspiration is her mum Zulaika, who was also a village nurse. I used to play with syringes in my childhood. I got so used to the smell of hospital, she recalls. From a young age, she understood the importance of her mothers work in providing healthcare to poor and semi-literate rural women. At that time, private hospitals were rare and women from all backgrounds relied on the state maternity home which is now called a primary health centre. When I started, there was one doctor, seven helpers and two other nurses, says Kathija. Work was very hectic in the first few years. I couldnt look after my children. I missed family functions. But those days gave me a very valuable learning experience. In 1990, Indias maternal mortality rate (MMR) stood at 556 deaths per 100,000 live births. In the same year, India recorded 88 infant deaths per 1,000 live births. The latest government figures show that MMR stands at 97 per 100,000 live births, and the infant mortality rate at 27 per 1,000 live births. Kathija attributes this progress to government investment in rural healthcare and rising female literacy rates. On a normal day, Kathija would handle just one or two births but she easily remembers her busiest day. 8 March 2000 was the most hectic day in my life. It was International Womens Day and people were greeting her as she walked into the clinic. I saw two women in labour waiting for me. I helped them deliver their babies. Then six more women came into our clinic. Kathija only had one assistant to help her but the stress was soon forgotten. When I was about to leave that day, I could hear infants crying. It was a very nice feeling. The nurse reckons she has helped bring into the world 50 pairs of twins and one pair of triplets. Now, Kathija says that women from wealthy families prefer to go to private hospitals. She has also seen a surge in Caesarean sections. My mother saw so many deaths during childbirth. Caesareans have saved so many lives, says Kathija. When I started, women used to fear surgery. But now many fear natural births and are opting for surgery. As the income of rural households has improved in the past three decades, it has brought its own challenges. Gestational diabetes used to be a rare condition. But now, its becoming very common. There has been a significant societal shift as Kathija now receives a growing number of requests from husbands who eagerly want to be present during childbirth with their wives. I have seen bad times and good times. Some husbands would not even visit their wives if she bore a girl child. Some women would weep uncontrollably if she delivered a second or third girl. In the 90s, cases of sex-selective abortions and infanticide were so widely reported that the Indian government banned doctors from revealing a babys gender to parents. The Tamil Nadu government also launched a Cradle Baby Scheme to take care of unwanted girls. But now, the scenario has changed, says Kathija. Many couples only opt for two children, irrespective of gender. She has no firm plans for life after retirement, but knows what she will miss. I always look forward to hearing the shrill and piercing first cry of a new-born, she says. You know even women who go through a painful labour, they forget everything and start smiling when they hear their babies cry. Watching that relief was such an exhilarating experience for me. It was a soulful journey for me all these years. Source: BBC -Agencies",
