        "title": "President claims some are attempting to disrupt countrys economic recovery",
        "date": "July 7, 2024 03:54 pm",
        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe emphasized that some individuals are attempting to disrupt the countrys economic progress. He announced that despite the economic crisis, the government has managed to implement salary increases for public servants this year and assured that necessary allocations will be made in the upcoming budget. During the last economic crisis, some suggested cutting 500,000 public service jobs due to an inability to pay government salaries. However, the President stated that he did not follow this advice and instead increased VAT to 18 to ensure salaries were paid on time. He also emphasized that the tax burden on the people cannot be increased any further. President Wickremesinghe made these remarks at the Uva Provincial Community Police Committee members empowerment workshop, held yesterday (06) at the Wellawaya Public Stadium under the theme A Law-Abiding Country. The President, addressing the gathering, expressed surprise that some human rights lawyers also represent drug-related criminals after their arrest. Highlighting that drug trafficking poses a greater threat to the nation than terrorism today, he emphasized the crucial need for collective support to safeguard the country from this menace, especially as it recovers from economic challenges. He stressed that failing to protect future generations from drug abuse could undermine all government efforts to advance the nation. During the event, the President awarded ID cards to members of the Uva Province Community Police Committee who made significant contributions to the Yukthiya operation conducted by the Sri Lanka Police Department across the island. Selected members were also honoured with the title of Justice of the Peace. President Ranil Wickremesinghe speaking at the event, recounted, In the 1990s, during a vacation in Switzerland, I stayed at my fathers friends house. Upon arrival, I was informed that the police would visit that evening. When I inquired why, I learned it was customary in their village to report visits by outsiders to the police. This practice is a regular routine in those countries. It ensures that outsiders are monitored, making it difficult for terrorists and drug traffickers to operate freely. Today, we have initiated a similar community police system here. Such systems are operational in England and various European nations, where police have knowledge of residents in every household. Unfortunately, this system has faltered in several European cities, including London. Consequently, crime and drug trafficking have increased. The failure to maintain law and order was cited as a contributing factor in the downfall of Rishi Sunaks government. It underscores the governments primary responsibility to uphold law and order. We also took necessary steps to maintain law and order in the country. During 2021-2022, there was a collapse in law and order, with incidents of arson and destruction of houses and properties. Restoring law and order became imperative under these circumstances. Drug traffickers were involved in these destructive activities. Therefore, alongside economic development efforts, we focused on controlling drug trafficking. The establishment of community police committees was part of this strategy. Initially, there were doubts about the success of this program, but today it has proven to be effective. In many areas, robberies are linked to drug addiction, as individuals steal to finance their drug habits. This situation is unsustainable. Currently, drugs from Afghanistan are entering our country and are also being trafficked to neighbouring countries like Pakistan and India via sea routes. Consequently, we are mobilizing the Navy to address this issue. Regional cooperation is crucial, and neighbouring countries have collectively committed to finding a solution to combat drug trafficking. We have initiated this program in rural areas concurrently with general law enforcement, placing particular emphasis on combating drug trafficking. Our future generation is imperilled by this illicit trade, necessitating our collective cooperation. I urge everyone to collaborate closely with the police on this critical issue. Religious places, including village temples, have been assigned a specific responsibility in this matter. Additionally, schools need to pay special attention as some students bring drugs onto school premises. Therefore, I call upon these committees to rigorously enforce anti-drug laws and uphold law and order in our country. I have reluctantly had to resort to legal measures for certain individuals, but current laws are inadequate. We need new legislation; while Singapore enforces the death penalty for drug traffickers, we seek custodial solutions without going to such extremes. After the arrest of these individuals, some lawyers who advocate for human rights have come forward in their defence. This raises questions for me. I believe that drug trafficking is a violation of human rights, but they argue that selling drugs is not a human rights violation, while arresting drug dealers is a human rights violation. Therefore, it is essential for the parliament to clarify our stance on this issue. Today, we are emerging from a period of economic threat to the country. Over the past two, three years, we have faced numerous challenges. Some people used to steal to make a living. But today, they steal to buy drugs. We are now gradually stabilizing the economy. We have secured concessions for loan repayments and are working on creating a new economic system. To manage public funds effectively, we have prepared the Public Finance Act, Public Debt Act, and Central Bank Act. Controlling the budget is now our priority. In the past, we implemented the Aswesuma program to provide relief to low-income individuals and increased the salaries of government employees by Rs.10,000. We recognize the difficulties faced by the people and are committed to stabilizing the economy and providing relief in a balanced manner. However, some people are now calling for further salary increases. This is a challenging task. We have already given teachers a salary increase in 2022 and a Rs.10,000 stipend in 2024. Therefore, these additional demands are unfair, as those who received two benefits should recognize that others received only one. Additionally, Development Officers and clerks are requesting salary increases. However, there is no available funding for these increases. To accommodate such raises, taxes would need to be increased. Currently, VAT is set at 18. If we were to provide these allowances, we would have to increase VAT again, which the people cannot afford. Moreover, the government workforce should ideally be 1 million, but it currently stands at 1.5 million. Some proposed sending 500,000 employees on unpaid leave and later suggested paying them. They claimed that VAT need not be increased to 18 to pay salaries for 1 million employees. In response, I stated that no one can be sent back. The government cannot afford to increase public servant salaries this year after raising VAT and facing public criticism. If such a salary increase is given, it will inconvenience the public. We need to prepare for the elections starting in the middle of this month. However, we have already appointed a committee to review these salary revisions for next year and are working to allocate the necessary funds in the 2025 budget. Some people are trying to undermine the countrys economic progress. If we accommodate these wage increases now, we will lose USD 8 billion. Given the current state of our economy, no party can afford this. As we move forward, we should focus on transforming our economy into an export-driven one. To this end, we have introduced the Economic Transformation Law. As a result, modern agriculture is being established in the country. This provides the opportunity to develop the Uva province into a significant agricultural export area. Additionally, the tourism, agriculture, and information technology sectors can be developed in the Badulla district. We need to create a new economy in our country. However, if our future generations are destroyed by drugs while we work towards this goal, our efforts will be in vain. It is your responsibility to protect the youth. Minister of Public Security Tiran Alles, Looking back at the past two years, everyone is aware of the situation in the country. People had to endure long queues, and the country was in turmoil. Finding a leader was a challenge. During this time, President Ranil Wickremesinghe courageously accepted the position of Prime Minister for the people of the country. A few months later, he assumed the presidency. Since then, the President has worked tirelessly to develop the country at every opportunity. The era of queues has ended. Instead of the Samurdhi grant, more substantial relief measures have been implemented for the people. Despite numerous economic challenges, subsidies such as bursaries and allowances for the elderly have been maintained. In just two years, he successfully stabilized the country. Establishing law and order is crucial for these achievements. The underworld and drug trafficking have been detrimental to our nation, prompting the initiation of a control program. The Justice Mission was launched to serve our citizens. I have pledged that by the end of June this year, there will be significant changes in the underworld and drug landscape. Operation Justice has been executed despite formidable challenges. Regardless of the obstacles ahead, this operation will persist. Under the leadership of President Ranil Wickremesinghe, we are committed to eradicating the underworld and drugs from our country by December of next year. Religious leaders, led by the Maha Sangha of the province, Secretary to the Ministry of Public Security Viyani Gunathilaka, Inspector General of Police Deshabandu Tennakoon, senior police officers, members of the Community Police Committee, and others attended the event. --PMD--",

        "date": "July 7, 2024 04:57 pm",
        "content": "The crew of a NASA mission to Mars emerged from their craft after a yearlong voyage that never left Earth. The four volunteer crew members spent more than 12 months inside NASAs first simulated Mars environment at Johnson Space Center in Houston, coming out of the artificial alien enviroment Saturday around 5 p.m. Kelly Haston, Anca Selariu, Ross Brockwell and Nathan Jones entered the 3D-printed habitat on June 25, 2023, as the maiden crew of the space agencys Crew Health and Performance Exploration Analog project. Haston, the mission commander, began with a simple, Hello. Its actually just so wonderful to be able to say hello to you all, she said. Jones, a physician and the mission medical officer, said their 378 days in confinement went by quickly. The quartet lived and worked inside the space of 17,000 square feet (1,579 square meters) to simulate a mission to the red planet, the fourth from the sun and a frequent focus of discussion among scientists and sci-fi fans alike concerning a possible voyage taking humans beyond our moon. The first CHAPEA crew focused on establishing possible conditions for future Mars operations through simulated spacewalks, dubbed Marswalks, as well as growing and harvesting vegetables to supplement their provisions and maintaining the habitat and their equipment. They also worked through challenges a real Mars crew would be expected to experience including limited resources, isolation and delays in communication of up to 22 minutes with their home planet on the other side of the habitats walls, NASA said. Two additional CHAPEA missions are planned and crews will continue conducting simulated spacewalks and gathering data on factors related to physical and behavioral health and performance, NASA said. Steve Koerner, deputy director of Johnson Space Center, said most of the first crews experimentation focused on nutrition and how that affected their performance. The work was crucial science as we prepare to send people on to the red planet, he said. Theyve been separated from their families, placed on a carefully prescribed meal plan and undergone a lot of observation, Koerner said. Mars is our goal, he said, calling the project an important step in Americas intent to be a leader in the global space exploration effort. Emerging after a knock on the habitats door by Kjell Lindgren, an astronaut and the deputy director of flight operations, the four volunteers spoke of the gratitude they had for each other and those who waited patiently outside, as well as lessons learned about a prospective manned mission to Mars and life on Earth. Brockwell, the crews flight engineer, said the mission showed him the importance of living sustainably for the benefit of everyone on Earth. Im very grateful to have had this incredible opportunity to live for a year within the spirit of planetary adventure towards an exciting future, and Im grateful for the chance to live the idea that we must utilise resources no faster than they can be replenished and produce waste no faster than they can be processed back into resources, Brockwell said. We cannot live, dream, create or explore on any significant timeframe if we dont live these principles, but if we do, we can achieve and sustain amazing and inspiring things like exploring other worlds, he said. Science officer Anca Selariu said she had been asked many times why there is a fixation on Mars. Why go to Mars? Because its possible, she said. Because space can unite and bring out the best in us. Because its one defining step that Earthlings will take to light the way into the next centuries. Source: AP --Agencies",

        "title": "Both of us were dedicated to an undivided Sri Lanka  President on the late R. Sampanthan",
        "date": "July 7, 2024 08:09 pm",
        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe paid tribute to the late Mr. R. Sampanthan, acknowledging him as a leader who championed the rights not only of the Tamil people but also of all Sri Lankans. He emphasized that both Mr. Sampanthan and himself were committed to the cause of an undivided Sri Lanka. The President urged everyone to unite in successfully concluding the discussions initiated with Mr. Sampanthan. President Wickremesinghe made these remarks while attending Mr. R. Sampanthans funeral at his residence in Trincomalee this afternoon (07). The funeral ceremony, honouring the former Leader of the Opposition and the Tamil National Alliance (TNA), as well as the late Trincomalee District Member of Parliament, was attended by numerous political leaders, both from the Government and the opposition. Expressing his sorrow over the death of Mr. R. Sampanthan, President Ranil Wickremesinghe mentioned that his passing is the loss of a long-time friend. The President affirmed his commitment to addressing the issues faced by the Tamil people, which Mr. Sampanthan consistently advocated for. He announced that the draft of the National Land Commission Bill is ready to be submitted to Parliament. This commission will have the authority to resolve issues faced by the Sinhalese, Tamil, and Muslim communities in coordination with the Department of Forest. The President appreciated Mr. Sampanthans role as Leader of the Opposition, highlighting that an opposition leader is essentially an alternative prime minister. He praised Mr. Sampanthan for displaying the qualities of a true opposition leader by addressing the concerns of all Sri Lankans, not just the Tamil community. Additionally, the President commented on the upcoming elections, stating that regardless of any court challenges, the presidential election will be held this year. He also indicated that arrangements will be made to hold parliamentary and provincial council elections following the presidential election. Addressing the funeral gathering the President further mentioned: I have lost a long-time friend with the demise of Mr. R. Sampanthan. I met him 50 years ago when he was a lawyer and I was a new lawyer. In 1977, Mr. Sampanthan and I came to Parliament as new MPs. In that parliamentary election, I supported Mr. Navaratnam Raja, the working committee member of our party from Trincomalee. But Mr. Sampanthan won the seat. The Parliament was divided into two parties, especially according to the proposal that a separate state should be formed. Mr. Sampanthan had a special relationship with the members of the Government. He always said that this country cannot be divided and we should advocate for a federal system or for granting more powers than the district council system that we created. There was a problem between us. When I was taken over a piece of land in Trincomalee to the Youth Service Council, there were debates between us in Parliament. His efforts to control this and our efforts were not successful. He left Sri Lanka in 1983. After he returned to Parliament, we reconnected. After the end of terrorism in 2009, I had the opportunity to work with him again on the problems of the Tamil people. He never demanded a separate state. He always said that everyone should be together. He emphasized that the Tamil people are suffering and their problems should be solved immediately. We have worked together in elections and supported common candidates. We all worked together especially for President Maithripala Sirisenas victory. Before that, he worked for Mr. Sarath Fonsekas election. I always talked to him about past events and politics. He was the only living person as a MP who saw the opportunity of the country gaining independence in 1948. We often discussed politics and our shared experiences. After that, he worked as the leader of the opposition. He showed his character well in his tenure. He not only talked about the problems of the Tamil people and worked on them, but he also presented the problems of all Sri Lankans as the leader of the opposition. At that time, he acted as a true opposition leader, who becomes an alternative prime minister. He demonstrated great leadership as the leader of the opposition when I lost the prime ministership during the political crisis in 2018. For various reasons, our negotiations did not succeed, especially after the Easter Sunday bombings, when we lacked the background to present political solutions. After I assumed the presidency, I discussed these issues with him and with Tamil parties and MPs. Some very important ideas were gathered during these discussions. Both of us agreed to find solutions to these issues in an undivided Sri Lanka. While these negotiations were on-going, I had to prioritize leading the country out of bankruptcy. As a result, our negotiations had to be postponed for the last few months. I looked into whether these discussions could be resumed this parliamentary week. But before that opportunity came, Mr. Sampanthan left us. Nevertheless, we must continue these discussions and conclude them. The draft of the National Land Commission Bill is now prepared to be submitted to Parliament. There are issues among Sinhala, Tamil and Muslim communities with the Forest Department regarding the acquisition of their villages. I hope to empower this commission to resolve those issues by law. It is declared necessary to hold provincial council elections. However, we have discussed and decided to hold the presidential election first. Regardless of any legal challenges, the presidential election will be held this year. Following that, parliamentary elections will be conducted, and then provincial council elections will be held. Due to the complexities in the new system, requests were made to hold the provincial council elections according to the old system. There was an agreement among us for that. It was decided to ensure women and youth representation and to allow parliamentarians to compete for these elections while retaining their membership. By implementing the 13th amendment, we are negotiating with the Chief Ministers who are now represent the Parliament to transfer a number of other powers from the central government, excluding police powers. Other powers can be discussed later. As a new proposal, the government has suggested decentralizing maximum power within the framework of the 13th amendment in the distribution of power. Additionally, the report of the Nawaz Commission needs to be discussed. The Foreign Minister has informed me that the drafted bill of the Truth, Unity and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) is prepared to be submitted to Parliament. Moreover, we have discussed and reached an agreement on the Jana Sabha system. We intend to take these discussions forward and bring them to a conclusion. Mr. Sampanthan was a leader who worked tirelessly for the rights of the Tamil people and advocated for the rights of all Sri Lankans. Both of us were dedicated to an undivided Sri Lanka. We initiated these discussions with mutual agreement and request everyones support to complete this important work. --PMD--",

        "content": "Police have today recovered a stock of drugs worth more than Rs. 5,000,000 from the rented house of drug trafficker Sahan Dhananjaya, alias Kona, who was shot while fleeing from police officers after pointing a firearm at them. Athurugiriya Police had received information that Kona, a known drug trafficker, was transporting drugs from Kottawa to the Piliyandala area on July 4. Acting on this intelligence, the police had conducted a special traffic inspection at the Friday Pola (fair) junction in Piliyandala. During the inspection, a person had exited a car that had been stopped by police and brandished a firearm at the officers. In response, the police officers had opened fire at him. Despite the police firing at him, the individual had managed to flee, and his bullet-ridden car was later found abandoned in the Kesbewa area. The suspect was subsequently apprehended while receiving medical treatment at the Kalubowila Teaching Hospital for a gunshot wound in his leg. Kona was arrested along with his wife, and following their interrogation, the police searched their rented house in the Halpita area of Polgasowita. During the search, officers discovered various types of drugs, including cocaine, crystal methamphetamine (Ice), and Kerala cannabis, with a total estimated street value exceeding Rs. 5,000,000. Further investigations revealed that Kona had visited this house a few days prior to being shot. Upon questioning the suspects wife, it was disclosed that the house belonged to Kalubowila Sudu Nona, a prominent drug dealer in the Kalubowila area. Following this revelation, the police also arrested Kalubowila Sudu Nona today (07) and confiscated nearly 09 grams of Ice drugs from her possession. Both women have been remanded for seven days after being produced at the Kesbewa Magistrates Court.",

        "title": "Indian PM Modi makes first visit to ally Russia since start of Ukraine war",
        "date": "July 8, 2024 10:10 am",
        "content": "Indias prime minister begins a two-day visit to Russia on Monday, his first since Moscow launched its invasion of Ukraine, a war that has complicated the relationship between the longtime allies and pushed Russia closer to Indias rival China. Prime Minister Narendra Modis visit will include a meeting with President Vladimir Putin, whom he last saw in Russia in 2019, in the far eastern port of Vladivostok. The two leaders also met in person in September 2022 in Uzbekistan, at a summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization bloc. Russia has had strong ties with India since the Cold War, and New Delhis importance as a key trading partner for Moscow has grown since the Kremlin sent troops into Ukraine in February 2022. China and India have become key buyers of Russian oil following sanctions imposed by the United States and its allies that shut most Western markets off to Russian exports. Under Modis leadership, India has avoided condemning Russias war in Ukraine while emphasizing the need for a peaceful settlement. The partnership between Moscow and New Delhi has become fraught, however, since Russia started developing closer ties with Indias main rival, China, because of the hostilities in Ukraine. Modi notably stayed away last week from the most recent summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, in Kazakhstan. Chietigj Bajpaee, senior South Asia research fellow at the U.K.-based Chatham House, said India is becoming increasingly estranged from forums in which Russia and China play a prominent role. This is evident in Indias relatively low key presidency of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization last year, and now the decision by Modi not to attend this years summit, Bajpaee said. A confrontation in June 2020 along the disputed China-India border dramatically altered their already touchy relationship as the rival troops fought with rocks, clubs and fists. At least 20 Indian soldiers and four Chinese soldiers were killed. Tensions have since persisted despite talks. Those tensions have seeped into how New Delhi looks at Moscow. Russias relations with China have been a matter of some concern for India in the context of Chinese increased assertiveness in the region, D. Bala Venkatesh Verma, a former Indian ambassador to Russia, told The Associated Press. But Modi also will seek to continue close relations with Russia, an important trading partner and major defense supplier for India. Since Western sanctions blocked Russian oil exports after the start of the Ukraine war, India has become a key buyer of Russian oil. It now gets more than 40 of its oil imports from Russia, according to analysts. India is also strongly dependent on Russia for military supplies, but with Moscows supply line hit by the fighting in Ukraine, India has been diversifying its defense procurements, buying more from the U.S., Israel, France and Italy. Defense cooperation will clearly be a priority area, Bajpaee said, adding that 60 of Indias military equipment and systems is still of Russian origin. Weve seen some delay in the deliveries of spare parts ... following the Russian invasion of Ukraine, he said. I believe both countries are due to conclude a military logistics agreement, which would pave the way for more defense exchanges. India has adopted a neutral stance, neither condemning nor condoning Russias war on Ukraine, and has called for negotiations to end the fighting. That in turn has bolstered Putins efforts to counter what he calls the Wests domination of global affairs. Facing an arrest warrant by the International Criminal Court for actions over the war in Ukraine, Putins foreign travel has been relatively sparse in recent years, so Modis trip could help the Russian leader boost his image. We kind of see Putin going on a nostalgia trip  you know, he was in Vietnam, he was in North Korea, said Theresa Fallon, an analyst at the Center for Russia, Europe, Asia Studies. In my view, hes trying to demonstrate that hes not a vassal to China, that he has options, that Russia is still a great power. Alexander Gabuev, head of the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center, said that Putins interactions on the world stage show he is far from isolated and that Russia is not a country to be discounted. Trade development also will figure strongly in the talks, particularly intentions to develop a maritime corridor between Indias major port of Chennai and Vladivostok, the gateway to Russias Far East. India-Russia trade has seen a sharp increase, touching close to 65 billion in the 2023-24 financial year, due to strong energy cooperation, Indian Foreign Secretary Vinay Mohan Kwatra told reporters Friday. Imports from Russia touched 60 billion and exports from India 4 billion in the 2023-24 financial year, Kwatra said. Indias financial year runs from April to March. He said India was trying to correct the trade imbalance with Russia by increasing its exports. Indias top exports to Russia include drugs and pharmaceutical products, telecom instruments, iron and steel, marine products and machinery. Its top imports from Russia include crude oil and petroleum products, coal and coke, pearls, precious and semi-precious stones, fertilizer, vegetable oil, gold and silver. Source: AP --Agencies",

        "date": "July 8, 2024 02:25 pm",
        "content": "Two pistols owned by the French emperor Napoleon Bonaparte, with which he once intended to kill himself, have been sold at auction for 1.69m (1.4m). The weapons, which were created by the Paris gunmaker Louis-Marin Gosset, had been expected to fetch between 1.2m and 1.5m. They were sold at the Osenat auction house on Sunday - next to the Fontainebleau palace where Napoleon tried to take his own life following his abdication in 1814. The pistols sale comes after Frances culture ministry recently classified them as national treasures and banned their export. This means the French government now has 30 months to make a purchase offer to the new owner, who has not been named. It also means the pistols can only leave France temporarily. The guns are inlaid with gold and silver, and feature an engraved image of Napoleon himself in profile. He was said to have wanted to use them to kill himself on the night of 12 April, 1814 after the defeat of his army by foreign forces meant he had to give up power. However, his grand squire Armand de Caulaincourt removed the powder from the guns and Napoleon instead took poison but survived. He later gave the pistols to Caulaincourt, who in turn passed them to his descendants. Also included in the sale were the pistols original box and various accessories including a powder horn and various powder tamping rods. Auctioneer Jean-Pierre Osenat said that the image of Napoleon at his lowest point was being sold alongside the objects. Napoleon memorabilia is highly sought after. One of the tricorne hats that became a part of his brand sold for 1.9m in November. The historic leader returned to power in 1815 following his exile to the Mediterranean island of Elba but went on to be defeated at the Battle of Waterloo. He died in 1821 after his second banishment - this time to the island of St Helena in the South Atlantic. Source: BBC --Agencies",

In the capital, Kyiv, at least seven people were killed in a rare daytime attack. The citys mayor said a childrens hospital was hit by the missile strike and was being evacuated. The head of the military administration in the central Ukrainian city of Kryvyi Rih said at least 10 people had been killed there, with three killed in the eastern town of Pokrovsk. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who is visiting Poland, said that Russia had fired some 40 missiles at targets across the country. Mr Zelensky, who is due to travel to the US for this weeks Nato summit in Washington, said Russia had massively attacked Ukraine. Different cities: Kyiv, Dnipro, Kryvyi Rih, Sloviansk, Kramatorsk. More than 40 missiles of various types. Residential buildings, infrastructure and a childrens hospital were damaged, he said. Plumes of smoke could be seen across the capital Kyiv, while video posted on social media showed the destruction inside and outside of the Okhmadyt childrens hospital. It is not clear if anyone inside was injured. But Mr Zelensky said in a social media post that people were trapped under the rubble of the hospital. He added that the number of people injured at Okhmadyt hospital was unclear. Vitaliy Klitschko, Kyivs mayor, told the Reuters news agency the bombardment was the worst attack on the capital since the start of the war. Elsewhere, Oleksandr Vilkul, head of the military administration in Kryvy Rih, posted on the Telegram messaging app that at least 10 people were killed and 31 wounded following the attack on the city.

        "date": "July 8, 2024 04:20 pm",
        "content": "The Secretary to the Treasury Mahinda Siriwardana stated that granting the salary increase demanded by striking public servants would necessitate raising the current Value Added Tax (VAT) rate from 18 to between 20 and 21. He emphasized that the government cannot impose such a burden on the public. Mr. Siriwardana made these remarks during a discussion held today (08) at the Presidential Secretariat, chaired by President Ranil Wickremesinghe, concerning the demands of public service trade unions, according to the Presidents Media Division (PMD). The discussion addressed the trade union actions taken by several trade unions in the public service and explored potential positive solutions to their demands. It was noted that while a salary increase is not feasible this year, there is a plan to revise public service salaries in the 2025 Budget, based on recommendations from an expert committee investigating salary disparities, the statement said. The Treasury Secretary highlighted that a salary increase of Rs. 10,000 for government employees would require an additional Rs. 140 billion annually, and an increase of Rs. 20,000 would necessitate an additional Rs. 280 billion. To generate the required income, even with optimal management of current revenues, additional tax increases will be necessary, the Treasury Secretary pointed out. Specifically, he noted that to raise salaries by Rs. 10,000, the VAT would need to be increased by 2. Furthermore, to meet the wage demands of the trade unions, the VAT would need to be raised by more than 3. He emphasized that this is not feasible at this time, as the VAT is already at a maximum rate of 18. The Treasury Secretary also explained that, due to the governments efforts to stabilize the countrys economy, the Central Bank can no longer print money as it did before. Doing so would jeopardize the program with the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Senior Advisor to the President on Economic Affairs, Dr. R.H.S. Samaratunga, remarked that while increasing public servants salaries again this year is challenging, the President has committed to allocating funds for this in next years budget. He also mentioned that a separate expert committee has been appointed to study and report on salary discrepancies. The discussion included Presidents Secretary Mr. Saman Ekanayake and a group of senior government officials. --PMD",

        "title": "Sri Lanka to wrap up bond talks soon, seek to balance India and China ties",
        "date": "July 9, 2024 09:32 am",
        "content": "Sri Lanka will wrap up talks with international bondholders on its restructuring process in a few weeks, Foreign Minister Ali Sabry said on Tuesday, a major step for the island nation to emerge from its worst financial crisis in decades. Sri Lanka will also seek to balance its ties with giant neighbour India and China to ensure that there is no difference in dealing with the two, he said, as the rival Asian giants are key creditors and investors but are also jostling for geopolitical influence in the small Indian Ocean country. Hopefully within a couple of weeks, Sabry said in an interview at the Reuters NEXT conference in Singapore, when asked when the nations bond restructuring efforts with creditors will be finished. Towards the end of this month, officially, we are done and dusted with the restructuring process, then of course, in line with that, we need to start payment, he said. Sri Lanka secured a provisional agreement with some of its bondholders to move forward on restructuring about 12.5 billion of international bonds last week but now needs the rest of the private creditors and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to also agree. The country, which has 37 billion in external debt, clinched an agreement with its official creditors including Japan, China and India in late June to restructure 10 billion in debt. In total, the debt rework is estimated to save Sri Lanka 8 billion in write-offs and delay capital repayments by at least four years. Sri Lanka will use this opportunity to restart about a dozen stalled, foreign-funded development projects and promote economic growth, Sabry said. Sri Lanka needs to continue reforms including imposing property taxes, revamp loss-making state-owned companies and improve dollar reserves to put its economy fully on track, the IMF said in its latest review. BALANCING INDIA, CHINA A country of 22 million, Sri Lankas economy is heavily dependent on foreign tourists and investments while its strategic location on a major east-west shipping route close to the southern tip of India makes it a key political player. India, which has strong cultural ties with Sri Lanka, and China have competed for influence in Colombo for years and the island nation has often been caught in their rivalries. India is also critical to Sri Lankas tourism, port development and renewable energy sectors with the two countries planning to connect their power grids eventually, Sabry said. Closer ties with southern Indian states such as Tamil Nadu will fuel a lot of synergies between the two countries that will help Sri Lankas economy growth faster. New Delhi has in recent years objected to Chinese research vessels docking at Sri Lankas ports saying it is concerned about the capabilities and intentions of such missions close to its territory, causing Colombo to suspend foreign research ships docking this year. Sabry said Colombo has now decided to engage with India, China and others while making it clear to its partners that it will not allow anything which would legitimately threaten a neighbours security. We are not going to have a system which applies to everyone else and not to China...all these systems will be universal ... as a neutral player, we should do that, he said. Sri Lanka is scheduled to hold presidential elections before mid-October, which Sabry said was evolving into a three-horse race between incumbent President Ranil Wickremesinghe and two opposition politicians with the economy being the key battleground. Sri Lanka is expected to grow 3 this year for the first time since its financial crisis in 2022 when the economy went into freefall due to a severe shortage of dollars that forced it to default on its foreign debt.

        "date": "July 9, 2024 09:53 am",
        "content": "More than 130 wild animals, including at least six rare rhinos, have died in flooding at a national park in north-eastern India, officials say. The Kaziranga National Park in Assam is experiencing its worst deluge in recent years. The dead animals - many of whom died by drowning - include 117 hog deer, two sambar deer, a rhesus macaque and an otter. In 2017, more than 350 animals died due to floods in the park and vehicle collisions during migration through animal corridors to the highlands. Officials say they have rescued 97 animals from flood waters - 25 of them are receiving medical care while 52 others have been released after treatment. Kaziranga is home to the worlds largest population of one-horned rhinos, which were nearly extinct at the turn of the century. Its a Unesco World Heritage site, with over 2,400 one-horned rhinos. The park is also a tiger reserve and home to elephants, wild water buffalo and numerous bird species. The endangered South Asian dolphins are also found in the rivers that criss-cross the park. Last week, an 18-month-old rhino calf took shelter at a house in a village near the park and was rescued by the Centre for Wildlife Rehabilitation and Conservation, the Press Trust of India reported. Assam has been devastated by floods due to torrential rains, with major rivers in the state flowing above the danger level. This years rains have inundated large parts of the park and submerged thousands of villages. More than 60 people have been killed and over two million people displaced in the deluge. There has been extensive damage to roads and other infrastructure, as well as loss of crops and livestock. Officials have warned of even more rain with water levels in the Brahmaputra river, which runs through the state, expected to increase in the coming days. Across Assam, hundreds of relief camps have been set up to shelter the displaced. Flooding and landslides are a common occurrence during the monsoon in north-eastern India and neighbouring countries.

        "date": "July 9, 2024 10:38 am",
        "content": "Tropical Storm Beryl brought howling winds and torrential rain to southeast Texas on Monday, killing at least three people, flooding highways, closing oil ports, canceling more than 1,300 flights and knocking out power to more than 2.7 million homes and businesses. Beryl, the seasons earliest Category 5 hurricane on record, weakened from a hurricane after pounding the coastal Texas town of Matagorda with dangerous storm surges and heavy rain before moving across Houston, the U.S. National Hurricane Center (NHC) said. The agency said conditions could spawn tornadoes in Texas, Louisiana and Arkansas. The storm, which was expected to rapidly weaken as it moved inland, swept a destructive path through Jamaica, Grenada, and St. Vincent and the Grenadines last week. It killed at least 11 in Mexico and the Caribbean and before reaching Texas, Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick told reporters. In Texas, a 53-year-old man and a 74-year-old woman were killed in two incidents by trees that fell on their homes in the Houston area on Monday. A third person, a city of Houston employee going to work, drowned in an underpass, Patrick said. Oil refining activity slowed and some production sites were evacuated in the state that is the nations biggest producer of U.S. oil and natural gas. For those of you in northeast Texas, be aware. You will have tropical storm winds, maybe as late as midnight or 1 a.m. You will have flooding, you will have rain, and you need to stay off the roads, Patrick said. State officials had yet to assess the economic damage as officials remained on a rescue footing while powerful winds continued to blow. Restoring power would take several days, said Thomas Gleeson, chair of the Texas Public Utility Commission. More than 2,500 first responders were deployed statewide, said Nim Kidd, chief of the Texas Division of Emergency Management. Following warnings that it could be a deadly storm for communities in its path, people rushed to board up windows and stock up on fuel and other essential supplies. Before daybreak, strong gusts and torrential rain lashed cities and towns such as Galveston, Sargent, Lake Jackson and Freeport, television video showed. By late morning, many fallen trees blocked roads in Houston as the worst of the storm passed, with persisting winds and some road flooding, rendering lanes on major freeways impassable. The city barricaded flooded areas. Crews using a life jacket and ladder fire truck rescued a man from a truck on a flooded stretch of freeway, video posted on social media by Houstons local ABC station showed. Patrick said there were several other rescues. Flood waters exceeded 10 inches (25 cm) across most of Houston, Mayor John Whitmire said. Were literally getting calls across Houston right now asking for first responders to come rescue individuals in desperate life safety conditions, Whitmire said. The storm had strengthened to a Category 1 hurricane as it crossed the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico before making landfall. But the NHC said it was expected to weaken into a tropical depression overnight and a post-tropical cyclone on Tuesday. That was still enough to deliver more heavy rain as it moved northeastward from eastern Texas on Monday afternoon, across Arkansas on Tuesday, into the Lower Ohio Valley on Tuesday night, and finally into the Lower Great Lakes on Wednesday, the U.S. National Weather Service said. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the U.S. Coast Guard had positioned staff to assist with search and rescue efforts. FEMA also readied water, meals and generators to boost local response efforts, according to the Biden administration. Schools said they would close as the storm approached. Airlines canceled more than 1,300 flights, and officials ordered a smattering of evacuations in beach towns. Small businesses in Houston, including package delivery services and chiropractors, delayed openings or were closed on Monday. More than 2.7 million homes and businesses in Texas lost power, according to Patrick and PowerOutage.us. Several counties in southeastern Texas - including Houston, where many U.S. energy companies are headquartered - are under a flash-flood warning as thunderstorms unleashed up to nearly 12 inches (30 cm) of rain in some areas. Closures of major oil-shipping ports around Corpus Christi, Galveston and Houston ahead of the storm could disrupt crude oil exports, along with shipments of crude to refineries and motor fuel from the plants. The Corpus Christi Ship Channel has re-opened, while the Port of Houston was projected to resume operations on Tuesday afternoon. Some oil producers, including Shell and Chevron evacuated personnel from their Gulf of Mexico offshore production platforms ahead of the storm. Marathon Petroleum Corps refinery in Texas City, Texas was hit by a power interruption on Monday amid the storm, the company said in a statement. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "content": "U.S. President Joe Biden is not being treated for Parkinsons disease and has not seen a neurologist outside of his annual physicals, the White House said on Monday, after the New York Times reported that visitor logs showed a doctor specializing in the illness visited the White House at least eight times from August through March. Concerns that Biden might be suffering from an undisclosed illness have risen since he stumbled, appearing frail and losing his train of thought at times, at his June 27 debate against Republican Donald Trump. Dr. Kevin OConnor, the White House doctor, issued a letter on Monday night that said Biden has not seen a neurologist outside of his normal annual physical. Biden is battling criticism from some Democrats that he lacks the mental acuity to stand as their nominee against Trump in the Nov. 5 presidential election. Biden has, however, said he will not abandon his campaign, telling MSNBC via phone on Monday that he was not going anywhere. A Reuters review of White House visitor logs showed that Dr. Kevin Cannard, a neurologist and movement disorders specialist from Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, visited the White House eight times from August through March. Cannard has co-authored research on treatment for early Parkinsons disease at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. OConnor said Cannards visits to the White House were part of his neurological clinics aimed at supporting thousands of active duty members assigned in support of White House operations and not to treat the president. Cannards visits to the White House were first reported by The New York Post on July 6. One former White House official, who worked for Biden when he was vice president under President Barack Obama and as president, was treated by the same doctor for migraines in 2016, the former official told Reuters. The doctor came to the White House once a month then as part of his rotation, the individual said. White House spokesperson Karine Jean-Pierre refused to confirm or elaborate on Cannards visits earlier in the day. At the media briefing, she was frequently challenged by reporters and said she wanted to respect the privacy of all involved for security reasons. She said Biden had seen a neurologist three times connected to his annual physical exam. She did not explain Cannards presence at the White House but suggested it might be connected to treating some of the military personnel who work at the White House complex. There are thousands of military personnel that come to the White House and they are under the care of the medical unit, she said. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "date": "July 9, 2024 04:23 pm",
        "content": "Non-executive government employees, who reported for duty on July 8 and 9, 2024, will be granted a special salary increment as a token of appreciation for their dedication during a challenging economic period. This increment was approved by the Cabinet following President Ranil Wickremesinghes proposal, the Presidents Media Division (PMD) said. Accordingly, the Secretary of the Ministry of Public Administration, Home Affairs, Provincial Councils, and Local Government has been directed to inform all Ministry Secretaries, Department Heads, and Provincial Chief Secretaries and to issue the relevant circulars. Certain trade unions in non-executive services had planned actions such as sick leave and strikes on the mentioned dates. Despite previous economic instability, the government managed to stabilize the situation through extensive economic reforms implemented over the last two years, including the provision of a monthly allowance of Rs. 10,000 to all public servants. The Treasury Secretary highlighted the existing financial constraints, stating that further salary or allowance increases would not be feasible without imposing additional tax burdens on the public. The government remains committed to avoiding decisions that could worsen the financial strain on citizens already facing economic challenges. Nonetheless, the government acknowledges its responsibility to recognize and assess non-executive officials who fulfilled their duties without resorting to disruptive measures during this critical period, it added. Accordingly, instructions will be issued in a circular to all Ministry Secretaries, Department Heads, and Provincial Chief Secretaries in the presence of the Secretary of the Ministry of Public Administration, Home Affairs, Provincial Councils, and Local Government, according to the PMD. Over 200 public sector trade unions affiliated with the State and Provincial Public Service Unions Collective launched a trade union action to report sick leave yesterday (08) and today (09) demanding an allowance of Rs. 25,000 for all public sector employees, similar to that given for executive officers. Accordingly, government officials across several sectors did not show up for work yesterday leading to a significant disruption in the daily operations of these institutions including the Department of Registration of Persons and Immigration Department. In support of this action, the postal workers began a strike action last Sunday (07). The co-convener of the United Postal Trade Unions Front Chinthaka Bandara mentioned that their strike will continue until midnight today. Meanwhile, the teacher-principal trade unions have also decided to report sick today.",

Mr. Ekanayake highlighted that the President is constitutionally empowered, under Article 41C of the Constitution, to appoint the Attorney General with the approval of the Constitutional Council. He emphasized that there is no constitutional requirement to appoint the senior-most officer from the Attorney Generals Department to this position based on seniority. Historically, this practice has not been followed in Sri Lanka, with past appointments such as Sarath N. Silva, PC, and Mohan Peiris, PC, coming from outside the departments senior ranks. Additionally, Mr. Ekanayake pointed out the example from 2016 when President Maithripala Sirisena recommended multiple candidates, leading to the Constitutional Council approving Mr. Jayantha Jayasuriya, PC, as Attorney General. Mr. Ekanayake advised the BASL not to advocate for the claims of a single candidate among other qualified individuals, underscoring the need for a broad consideration of all potential candidates to ensure the appointee commands the confidence of the President and the Cabinet. Earlier, the Bar Association of Sri Lanka (BASL) had sent a letter to President Ranil Wickremesinghe, urging the appointment of the senior-most officer in the Attorney Generals Department to fill the vacancy left by Mr. Rajaratnam. The BASL emphasized that this practice honours the principle of seniority, ensures continuity and stability, and respects the established hierarchy within the department. Signed by BASL Secretary Chathura A. Galhena, the letter stressed the Attorney Generals critical role in upholding the rule of law and ensuring proper administration of justice, and urged the President to consider their concerns favourably. --PMD--",

PUCSL chairman Prof. Manjula Fernando stated that views were obtained from 46 pre-registered delegates representing various sectors. The Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) has handed over its proposals pertaining to the revision of electricity tariffs, to the Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL). According to the proposals, the overall reduction of tariffs as a percentage is 13.8. Accordingly, there will be a 25.5 decrease in rates for the domestic category and a 3 reduction for religious and charitable institutions. However, the proposals do not include any tariff reductions for hotel and industrial sectors. According to the proposed domestic electricity traffic revision, the electricity tariff charged for a unit of electricity for usage between 0 to 30 units will be reduced from Rs. 08 to Rs. 06. For 31 to 60 units, the tariff charged per unit has been reduced from Rs. 20 to Rs. 09. Based on the proposals presented by CEB, domestic electricity consumers have been divided into several other categories. The proposed changes include reducing the tariff for domestic electricity consumers using more than 60 units from Rs. 25 to Rs.15. Additionally, tariffs for those consuming between 61 to 90 units are proposed to decrease from Rs. 30 to Rs. 18 per unit. For consumers using between 91 to 120 units, the tariff is reduced from Rs. 50 to Rs. 30 per unit, and for those using between 121 to 180 units, it has been decreased from Rs. 50 to Rs. 42. Furthermore, it has been proposed to reduce the tariff for consumers using more than 181 from Rs. 75 to Rs. 65 per unit.",

The collision occurred on Wednesday on an expressway in Uttar Pradesh state, and 19 injured people have been rushed to hospital. Their condition is reported to be stable, said police officer Arvind Kumar. The bus was travelling from the northern state of Bihar to the capital New Delhi. Authorities are in the process of identifying the victims, and a probe has been launched to determine the exact cause of the accident, Kumar said. Gaurang Rathi, a government official, said that according to a preliminary investigation the bus may have been speeding when it struck the milk truck from behind, which led both vehicles to overturn. The collision was severe enough that one side of the bus was torn off, causing passengers to be ejected from the vehicle. India has some of the highest road death rates in the world, with hundreds of thousands of people killed and injured annually. Most crashes are blamed on reckless driving, poorly maintained roads and aging vehicles. In May, a bus carrying Hindu pilgrims skidded and rolled into a deep gorge on a mountainous highway in Indian-controlled Kashmir on Thursday, killing at least 21 people. Source: AP --Agencies",

        "date": "July 10, 2024 11:10 am",
        "content": "The Tea Research Institute of Sri Lanka predicts that Sri Lankas tea exports are expected to generate a revenue of USD 1.5 billion in the year 2024. Meanwhile, as part of the first stage of a three-phase program to provide fertilizer at a concessionary rate, 10,000 metric tonnes out of the planned 30,000 metric tonnes of fertilizer has been distributed among tea planters so far. Recently, Minister of Agriculture and Plantation Industries Mahinda Amaraweera convened a progress review meeting of the St. Coombs Estate in Talawakelle and the Tea Research Institute of Sri Lanka. Addressing the progress review meeting, Minister of Agriculture and Plantation Industries Mahinda Amaraweera revealed that the already cultivated lands of tea estates are sufficient for the development of Sri Lankas tea plantation industry. It was discussed during the meeting that the ban imposed on the import of agrochemicals in 2021 in promotion of organic agriculture, affected the tea plantations resulting in less amounts of fertilizer used on tea plantations in 2022 and 2023. This resulted in a decrease in tea production, according to the Minister. However, the current government, through the two state fertilizer providers, is taking measures to provide fertilizers at a concessionary price, he added further. Additionally, the Minister stated that as such, 50 kilograms of three types of tea fertilizers with a market value of Rs. 14,000, are provided at prices ranging from Rs. 5,500 to Rs. 7,500. According to the Department of Government Information, the Sri Lanka Tea Board has allocated Rs. 1,200 million to provide the concession for tea plantations. The Government Information Department further added that the distribution of fertilizer for tea plantations is being implemented in 3 stages. Meanwhile, it has also been discussed to provide fertilizer and also plant tea saplings in vacant areas of land with the aim of increasing the tea harvest in the coming year. Sri Lankas tea industry has generated foreign reserves of USD 1 to 1.2 billion during the last two years. The island nation exports tea to 150 countries worldwide out of which 20 countries purchase stocks of tea on a large scale. In the meantime, the Tea Research Institute of Sri Lanka has been able to identify 70 species of tea in high demand globally.",

        "title": "Sangakkara gives seal of approval to external investment in national cricket boards",
        "date": "July 10, 2024 11:52 am",
        "content": "Sri Lankan Kumar Sangakkara cricket legend believes investment partnering national cricket boards could help smaller nations compete at the highest level. Sangakkara was speaking at World Cricket Connects, an event at Lords hosted by the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) designed for the leading voices in the game to discuss the health of cricket and consider the path required for its future success. The event brought a range of prominent thinkers in cricket together at Lords, with players, coaches, broadcasters, franchise owners and administrators all in attendance. On the agenda was a wide range of topics, including the growth of the game, the distribution of finances and the global calendar. For Sangakkara, the position of Sri Lanka in the cricketing landscape is one key discussion point. He explained: Its about money, Sri Lanka needs money to invest in the game. How that money comes about, is it going to be ICC handouts, is it going to be the franchise game? How do you become self-sustainable? How do you do it if the market is so small or not as attractive. The players have avenues to go beyond Sri Lanka in terms of earning a living and plying their trade because of the franchise landscape. Sri Lankas place depends on how bilateral cricket continues to exist. Will it exist in the current format? Will it change? Will private investment partner the home boards to ensure they are not just skimming the cream off the top but also investing in the grassroots and growing the game? It is incumbent to build the home game and the audience of those products and the consumer base for those products. Sangakkara finished his playing career in 2017, making nearly 600 appearances for Sri Lanka across all formats. Ranking alongside Muttiah Muralitharan as arguably the countrys greatest-ever player, Sangakkara has since gone on to work as the coach of the Rajasthan Royals in the Indian Premier League. That has given him greater insight into the sports future than many, and Sangakkara explained that the sports growth could benefit from greater outside influence. He added: We have a governing body, the ICC, which is not completely independent as it is made up of the 12 home boards who are full members. Then you have private equity and private enterprise investing massively in the game through the IPL and common ownership throughout the franchise game. You have the broadcasters who have a huge insight and idea as to what the next generation of fans want, how they consume the game. They know what new avenues of thinking are needed to make sure the game is sustained financially. There are lots of stakeholders who need to play a part in the solution that the game requires and the direction of travel. Having just cricketers or traditional administrators administer the game, is that the right thing? Im not necessarily sure that it is. We need newer ideas, new perspectives, outside perspectives coming in to enhance the thinking in cricket and grow it as we know it can. Source: Sportsbeat --Agencies",

Through the United States Agency for International Development, the United States is facilitating the implementation of Sri Lankas Trade National Single Window System or TNSWS. Aimed at modernising the countrys trade facilitation infrastructure, the TNSWS will streamline the collection of information required for trade, leading to increased transparency and efficiency, reduced costs, and more potential revenue. Gabriel went on to say that the US is committed to initiatives like the TNSWS, which will make trade more transparent and predictable, easing business challenges.

        "content": "Sri Lankas envoy in Riyadh has launched a new initiative to celebrate the countrys expatriates building their professional careers in the Kingdom. Saudi Arabia is one of the top destinations for Sri Lankan expats, with tens of thousands of them living and working in the Kingdom. Sri Lankan migrant workers form part of the bilateral relations between Sri Lanka and Saudi Arabia. They play a significant role in contributing to the host countrys socio-economic development by sharing their skills and expertise, as well as to the economic growth of the home country by sending their hard-earned remittances, Ambassador Ameer Ajwad told Arab News on Wednesday. The first person to receive the accolade was Chandralal Senadhira, a manager who has served over 30 years working with the Saudi food and beverage giant Almarai and was set to retire and return to Sri Lanka. The Sri Lankan Embassy held a reception in his honor last week and plans to host more as part of the new tradition of recognizing and showing gratitude to nationals who contribute to Saudi-Sri Lankan ties and their homelands economy. In the spirit of demonstrating our gratitude  the Embassy of Sri Lanka in Riyadh, as an initial step, introduced felicitating long-served Sri Lankan migrant workers in Saudi Arabia who leave the Kingdom for good, in recognition of their vital contributions, Ajwad said. Expats have for decades been a main source of Sri Lankas foreign exchange. More than 1 million of them  or over half of the countrys overseas workforce  are employed in Gulf countries. Sri Lankan migrant workers serving in the Middle East region are a vital component of Sri Lankas economy. The largest amount of foreign exchange generated for Sri Lanka comes from the Sri Lankan migrant workers who serve in the Middle East, Ajwad said. This is a significant contribution to Sri Lankas financial stability, social welfare and development. With new opportunities available to expats in Saudi Arabia under its Vision 2030 megaprojects, more and more Sri Lankan professionals were finding employment in the Kingdom. Ajwad, who took office earlier this year, has made boosting their involvement in the projects one of his priorities. With the economic boom in Saudi Arabia in the recent past, the number of Sri Lankan migrant workers finding employment opportunities in the Kingdom is on the increase, he said. We are grateful to the government of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia for opening new channels for employment opportunities. Source: Arab News --Agencies",

Senior Additional Solicitor General Parinda Ranasinghe took oaths as the Acting Attorney General before the Chief Justice on July 01, after the proposal to extend former Attorney General Sanjay Rajaratnams term by another 06 months was defeated for the second time at the Constitutional Council meeting. However, the appointment sparked controversy, as allegations were leveled against the government claiming that the new appointment overlooked Senior Additional Solicitor General Ayesha Jinasena, despite her seniority and eligibility for the role, due to gender bias. However, in response to the relevant allegations, Presidents Secretary Saman Ekanayake emphasized that there is no constitutional requirement to appoint the senior-most officer from the Attorney Generals Department to this position based on seniority. He also expressed that the President is constitutionally empowered, under Article 41C of the Constitution, to appoint the Attorney General with the approval of the Constitutional Council.",

        "content": "Telecom industry group GSMA announced on Wednesday a global coalition of companies, organisations and financial institutions that will seek to make smartphones more accessible and affordable for some of the worlds poorest populations. The coalition will consist of mobile operators and vendors, and global institutions such as the World Bank Group, the United Nations agency ITU and the WEF Edison Alliance, the GSMA said in a statement. They will assess ways to lower the cost of entry into the digital economy for low-income populations, particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, it said. Handset affordability is often recognised as the most significant barrier to get people online, the GSMA said. It said mobile is often the only way for people in low and middle income countries to access the internet, with 38 of the global population living in areas where they cannot use mobile internet due to barriers such as high cost and lack of skills. The coalition will collaborate to improve access to affordable internet-enabled devices to close the Usage Gap, which holds back around three billion people worldwide from maximising their potential in the global digital economy, it added.

The suspect has made this request when the seven suspects arrested in relation to the incident were produced before the court on Wednesday (10). However, the Kaduwela Magistrate has advised the suspect in question to rethink the decision and make the request again during an upcoming court date. Meanwhile, the police requested the court for permission to detain the seven suspects for 48 hours for further interrogations. The Kaduwela Magistrate, who rejected the request, ordered the suspects to be remanded in custody until July 22. Furthermore, the magistrate ordered the prison officers to provide additional security to the suspects, since there are accomplices of the criminal figure infamously known as Loku Patee, who is suspected to be involved in the incident, detained in the prison. On Tuesday (09), police arrested seven suspects including the owner of the tattoo studio in Athurugiriya where the shooting incident took place on Monday (08), resulting in the deaths of Club Wasantha and another person and wounded four others. The other arrested individuals are suspected to have aided and abetted in the shooting incident. During the investigations carried out thus far, it has been revealed that the owner of the tattoo studio has received an amount of Rs. 1 million over a period of time.",

        "date": "July 11, 2024 03:33 pm",
        "content": "A fresh maritime dispute between New Delhi and Colombo seems to be brewing with Sri Lanka objecting to Indias plea to the International Seabed Authority (ISA) based at Kingston in Jamaica for rights to explore cobalt-rich ferromanganese crusts in Afanasy Nikitin Seamount in the Indian Ocean. Colombo has argued that the area where India wants to explore cobalt-rich ferromanganese crusts is entirely within the extended continental shelf claim of Sri Lanka. The island nations government has urged the ISA to refrain from accepting New Delhis plea for exploration rights in Afanasy Nikitin Seamount till the United Nations Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf (UN-CLCS) decides on its continental shelf claim. The ISA is following applicable procedures in this regard and the matter is ongoing, a spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Sri Lankan government said. Sri Lankas continental shelf claim also contradicts that of Indias and that is why remains pending with the UN-CLCS since 2009. The two neighbouring nations have been negotiating to end the impasse bilaterally. They, however, could not make any headway in the past one-and-a-half decades. The new dispute over the exploration of cobalt-rich crusts started brewing after the recent parliamentary elections in India saw the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party trying to rekindle the controversy over Katchatheevu Island and blaming the Congress and the Dravida Munnethra Kazhagam (DMK) for ceding it to Sri Lanka, sacrificing the interests of the fishermen of Tamil Nadu. The Earth System Science Organization (ESSO), an autonomous institute of the Ministry of Earth Sciences of the Government of India, submitted an application to the secretary general of the ISA on January 18, 2024, seeking approval for a 15-year plan of work for the exploration of cobalt-rich ferromanganese at Afanasy Nikitin Seamount in the central Indian Ocean. New Delhi moved the ISA seeking rights to explore the cobalt-rich crusts in Afanasy Nikitin Seamount in the wake of the increasing forays of the Chinese Peoples Liberation Armys research vessels in the Indian Ocean region. The ESSO deposited an application fee of 500,000 to the ISA  an autonomous international organization established under the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) to authorize and control the exploration of mineral deposits in the international seabed. The Afanasy Nikitin Seamount is a 400-kilometre-long and 150-kilometre-wide undersea mountainous feature in the equatorial Indian Ocean. It comprises a main plateau rising 1200 metres above the surrounding ocean floor at a depth of 4800 metres, and secondary elevated seamount highs, two of which lie at 1600 metre and 2050 metre water depths. The total area New Delhi wants to explore spans 3,000 sq. km and consists of 150 blocks, with none exceeding 20 sq. km in area. The blocks are organized and grouped into six clusters, each containing 12-50 blocks. The application area covering the six clusters is enveloped within an area measuring not more than 550 km by 550 km, according to an ISA document. Source: Deccan Herald --Agencies",

        "date": "July 11, 2024 04:04 pm",
        "content": "Russia is committed to finding the earliest possible solution to the issue of Indians being duped into joining its army and fighting in the Ukraine war, a top Russian diplomat said, in Moscows first comments on the matter. Seeking the discharge of Indians who joined Russias army on false premises has been a key focus of Prime Minister Narendra Modis talks with President Vladimir Putin in Moscow this week. An Indian official accompanying Modi said on Tuesday that Russia has promised their early discharge. The Russian army does not need Indians, especially those numbers which are very few ... They do not change the situation on the battleground in any way, Roman Babushkin, the Charge dAffaires of the Russian Embassy in India, said late on Wednesday. He told news agency ANI that while most Indians fighting in the war were there for what he called commercial purposes, some were cheated into joining up by agents. He added that India and Russia were coordinating closely to find a solution to the problem. Reuters has a minority stake in ANI. Asked about Russias investigation, Babushkin said the probe should take place in Russia and India because the agents involved are located mostly in India. India said last week about 30 to 40 Indians lured to Russia by the promise of lucrative jobs and education opportunities are now thought to be fighting in the Russian army, and at least four Indians have been killed in the conflict. India has arrested at least four people thought to be part of a nationwide human-trafficking network behind the racket, and it says 10 Indian nationals have been brought back from Russia so far. New Delhi and Moscow have had close ties since the days of the Soviet Union, and more recently India has been buying record amounts of discounted Russian oil after the West imposed sanctions on Russias crude following its invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. India has not condemned Russia for the conflict, instead calling for peace through dialogue and diplomacy. During his visit, however, Modi used emotive language to deliver an implicit rebuke to Putin, telling him that the death of innocent children was painful and terrifying, a day after a lethal strike on a childrens hospital in Kyiv. Russia has said, without providing evidence, that it was a Ukrainian anti-missile system that struck the hospital. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

Hasaranga said it is in the best interest of Sri Lanka Cricket that he decided to relinquish the captaincy duties and remain in the side as a player, the statement said. Sri Lanka will always have my utmost best efforts as a player, and I will support and stand by my team and leadership as always, said Wanindu Hasaranga in his resignation letter. Sri Lanka Cricket, while accepting his resignation, wishes to state that Hasaranga will remain an important player for us in our international cricketing plans, the SLC statement said. Batsman Charith Asalanka is tipped to be appointed as the next Sri Lanka T20I captain, according to sources. Wanindus resignation comes following Sri Lankas group stage exit from the 2024 mens T20I World Cup last month. Hasaranga had only been in charge of the T20I side for six months after he was appointed to the role in January earlier this year when Dasun Shanakas time as captain of both Sri Lanka mens white ball sides came to an end. The allrounder started off his reign with a series win over Zimbabwe, before also recording a 2-1 series win over Afghanistan ahead of the T20 World Cup. The resignation follows that of head coach Chris Silverwood, who resigned from his role shortly after Sri Lanka were eliminated from the competition. Silverwood had been in charge of the side in all three formats since April 2022.",

It is also reported that the police officer has received 8 stitches to his mouth following the incident. On Friday (05), the Bribery Commission apprehended the two suspects inside the CCD premises in Dematagoda. They had solicited a sum of Rs. 450,000 as a bribe and were apprehended while accepting the final payment of over Rs. 150,000 out of that. A resident of the Ibbagamuwa area of Kurunegala had lodged a complaint with the CCD in relation to a fraudulent money transfer through an online business of exchanging the electronic currency called USDT. The two suspected cops had allegedly stated to the complainant that two suspects connected to the incident were arrested and produced before the court. However, they have demanded a bribe of Rs. 454,200 to refrain from arresting the complainant as well. The individual in question has initially provided an amount of Rs. 300,000 to the two cops as the first payment of the bribe, the CIABOC said, adding that the duo were arrested while obtaining the remaining Rs. 154,200.
