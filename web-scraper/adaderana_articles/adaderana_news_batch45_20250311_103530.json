        "date": "October 13, 2024 04:38 pm",
        "content": "Former Minister Keheliya Rambukwella says that he has decided to temporarily step back from politics with the recent events that took place. Rambukwella announced his decision while speaking at an event held in Kandy today (13). However, the former Minister also mentioned that he will not hesitate to help the people to the fullest at anytime, although he pauses the political involvement. Furthermore, he revealed plans to focus on his business activities in the future. Additionally, the former Minister expressed confidence in being vindicated by the courts regarding the recent events. He emphasized his belief that justice will prevail and shared his hopes of returning to politics as an innocent person once the legal matters are resolved. Rambukwella has served in multiple ministerial posts, including as the Minister of Mass Media, Minister of Foreign Employment Promotion and Welfare, Minister of Water Supply and Drainage, Minister of Health and Minister of Environment. He initially joined the Democratic United National Front (DUNF) led by Lalith Athulathmudali, where he joined the politics, and later joined the United National Party (UNP) and was elected to the parliament from the Kandy District in 2000, winning 154,403 preferential votes. He was elected to the Parliament from Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) representing Kandy District in the 2020 General Election, where he secured 110,832 preferential votes. In October 2023, the National Medicines Regulatory Authority (NMRA) revealed forged documents were submitted for Customs clearance to procure a batch of vials containing human immunoglobulin which also failed to pass quality tests, during Rambukwellas tenure as the Health Minister. On 02 February 2024, Rambukella was arrested by the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) alongside former Secretary to the Ministry of Health Janaka Chandragupta, and was remanded. Rambukwella resigned from his ministerial post on 03 February following public outcry. However on September 11, 2024, he was released on two personal bails of Rs. 5 million each and a cash bond of Rs. 100,000.",

        "date": "October 14, 2024 08:26 am",
        "content": "The United States said on Sunday it will send U.S. troops to Israel along with an advanced U.S. anti-missile system, in a highly unusual deployment meant to bolster the countrys air defenses following missile attacks by Iran. U.S. President Joe Biden said the move was meant to defend Israel, which is weighing an expected retaliation against Iran after Tehran fired more than 180 missiles at Israel on Oct 1. The United States has been privately urging Israel to calibrate its response to avoid triggering a broader war in the Middle East, officials say, with Biden publicly voicing his opposition to an Israeli attack on Irans nuclear sites and his concerns about a strike on Irans energy infrastructure. Pentagon spokesperson Major General Patrick Ryder described the deployment as part of the broader adjustments the U.S. military has made in recent months to support Israel and defend U.S. personnel from attacks by Iran and Iranian-backed groups. But a U.S. military deployment to Israel is rare outside of drills, given Israels own military capabilities. U.S. troops in recent months have aided Israels defense from warships and fighter jets in the Middle East when it came under Iranian attack. But they were based outside of Israel. The Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system, or THAAD, is a critical part of the U.S. militarys layered air defense systems and adds to Israels already formidable anti-missile defenses. But a U.S. military deployment to Israel is rare outside of drills, given Israels own military capabilities. U.S. troops in recent months have aided Israels defense from warships and fighter jets in the Middle East when it came under Iranian attack. But they were based outside of Israel. The Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system, or THAAD, is a critical part of the U.S. militarys layered air defense systems and adds to Israels already formidable anti-missile defenses. A THAAD battery usually requires about 100 troops to operate. It counts six truck mounted launchers, with eight interceptors on each launcher, and a powerful radar. Irans Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi warned earlier on Sunday that the United States was putting the lives of its troops at risk by deploying them to operate U.S. missile systems in Israel. While we have made tremendous efforts in recent days to contain an all-out war in our region, I say it clearly that we have no red lines in defending our people and interests, Araqchi posted on X. Still, experts say Iran has sought to avoid a direct war with the United States, making deployment of U.S. forces to Israel another factor in its calculus going forward. Iran launched missiles and drones at Israel in April. Then on Oct. 1, Iran fired more than 180 ballistic missiles at Israel amid another escalation in fighting between Israel and Iran-backed Hezbollah in Lebanon. Many were intercepted in flight but some penetrated missile defenses. U.S. officials did not say how quickly the system would be deployed to Israel. The Pentagon said a THAAD was deployed to southern Israel for drills in 2019, the last and only time it was known to be there. Lockheed Martin, the biggest U.S. arms maker, builds and integrates the THAAD system, which is designed to shoot down short-, medium- and intermediate-range ballistic missiles. Raytheon, under RTX, builds its advanced radar. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "date": "October 14, 2024 10:17 am",
        "content": "A Nevada man with a shotgun, loaded handgun, ammunition and several fake passports in his vehicle was arrested at a security checkpoint outside Donald Trumps rally Saturday night in the Southern California desert, authorities said. He was released the same day on 5,000 bail. The suspect, a 49-year-old resident of Las Vegas, was driving an unregistered black SUV with a homemade license plate that was stopped by deputies assigned to the rally in Coachella, east of Los Angeles, Riverside County Sheriff Chad Bianco said at a news conference Sunday afternoon. The driver claimed to be a journalist but it was unclear if he had the proper credentials. Deputies noticed the interior of the vehicle was in disarray and a search uncovered the weapons and ammo, along with multiple passports and driver licenses with different names, Bianco said. The man was arrested on suspicion of possessing a loaded firearm and possession of a high-capacity magazine, the department said in a statement. This incident did not impact the safety of former President Trump or attendees of the event, the Saturday statement said. Trump had not yet arrived at the rally at the time of the arrest, the sheriff said Sunday. The suspect is scheduled to appear in court on Jan. 2, 2025, according to online records. Bianco declined to speculate about the suspects motives or frame of mind. We know we prevented something bad from happening, and it was irrelevant what that bad was going to be, Bianco said. The man made it past an outer security boundary and was stopped at an inner perimeter patrolled by the sheriffs department, Bianco said. Another security checkpoint closer to the rally site was operated by the Secret Service. The U.S. Secret Service assesses that the incident did not impact protective operations and former President Trump was not in any danger, the U.S. Attorneys Office said in a statement Sunday. While no federal arrest has been made at this time, the investigation is ongoing. Media members, as well as VIP ticket holders, were routed through a number of intersections manned by state and local law enforcement officers before arriving at a large, grassy area where drivers were asked to open hoods and trunks, and each vehicle was searched by a K-9 officer. Other general ticket holders were directed to a site roughly 3 miles away from the rally, where they were boarded onto buses and driven to the site. Trumps campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the arrest. Security is very tight at Trump rallies following two recent assassination attempts. Last month, a man was indicted on an attempted assassination charge after authorities said he staked out the former president for 12 hours and wrote of his desire to kill him. The Florida arrest came two months after Trump was shot and wounded in the ear in an assassination attempt during a campaign rally in Pennsylvania. Source: AP --Agencies",

        "date": "October 14, 2024 11:26 am",
        "content": "The Attorney General (AG) has informed the Supreme Court that the Cabinet of Ministers has decided to reconsider the matters related to the wind power project in Wedithalathivu, Mannar by Indias Adani Green Energy. The AG communicated this to the court when the Fundamental Rights (FR) petitions filed seeking an order to invalidate the Cabinet approval granted for Indias Adani Green Energy for a wind power project in Wedithalathivu, Mannar was taken up this morning (14). Accordingly, Deputy Solicitor General Avanthi Perera, who appeared on behalf of the AG, informed the court that the Cabinet of Ministers has decided to reconsider the facts related to the matter on November 07, 2024, and make a decision regarding the further continuation of the project. Furthermore, the Deputy Solicitor General stated before the court that the current interim Cabinet has reached this decision and requested for an extended date to communicate the decision which will be finalized by the new Cabinet of Ministers to be appointed after the upcoming General Election. She also informed that until then, the current stance regarding the relevant project will be maintained in the same manner. The petitioning party, who agreed to the facts presented by the Deputy Solicitor General, requested the bench of judges for permission to revise the relevant petitions as the respondents of the case have been changed with the formation of the new government. The Supreme Court, which granted permission to amend the petitions, also ordered that any observation of the government related to the relevant activities be filed before January 31, 2025. Later, the petitions were ordered to be recalled for consideration of facts on March 18 and 19, 2025. On August 02, the Supreme Court fixed for consideration the five Fundamental Rights petitions filed by five parties including the Centre for Environmental Justice against the Adanis wind power project, arguing that the proposed wind farm poses significant threats to ecological biodiversity and the safety of migratory birds. The respondents named in the petitions were ordered by the court to file limited objections, if any, before August 20 while any counter objections related to those were ordered to be filed before September 13. Later in September, the National Peoples Power (NPP) had vowed to cancel the Adani Groups wind power project in Sri Lanka if it gets elected in the presidential election, according to a news report on PTI. Nevertheless, Sri Lankas new government later said it will review the deal with the Adani Group, throwing a fresh hurdle for the Indian conglomerate as it seeks to expand abroad. The previous administrations approval of electricity prices for Adani Green Energy Ltd.s projects was a problem, Foreign Minister Vijitha Herath told reporters after a meeting of the Cabinet ministers. The new government would give the deal a fresh look after parliamentary elections are held Nov. 14, he said. The move to reassess the Adani Green deal follows through on a campaign pledge by newly elected president Anura Kumara Dissanayake, who had called the project a threat to Sri Lankas energy sovereignty and vowed to cancel it. Herath also said no policy decisions on major projects would be taken before the parliamentary poll. Any challenge to the deal would be a blow to Gautam Adanis ambitions, as the group led by Asias second-richest person looks to develop multiple infrastructure projects in the island nation. Projects in the works include expansion of the Colombo container-ship port backed by the US Development Finance Corp.",

Malwana - An army unit (with a boat) Katugoda - Army unit Wataraka- Army unit (with a boat) Seethawaka- Army unit Meethotamulla - Two army teams (with four Unibuffels) Kolonnawa- Army unit (with two horses) Nawagamuwa- Army unit (with two boats) Pelwatte - Army unit (with a Unibuffel) Yatadolawatta- Army unit (with a Unibuffel) A total of 6,500 troops, along with 23 WMZ vehicles, 34 Unibuffel vehicles, 34 Unicorn vehicles, and 56 boats, are prepared for immediate deployment across these regions to aid in rescue operations and provide much-needed relief, according to a statement by the Sri Lanka Army. The army remains on high alert as floodwaters continue to rise, with further measures expected as the situation develops. Meanwhile, 08 Navy flood relief teams have been dispatched to the Gampaha, Colombo and Puttalam districts, working in coordination with the Disaster Management Center (DMC) in order to assist those impacted by flood waters. The Navy flood relief teams were deployed to Kaduwela, Mabima, Nawagamuwa, Ihalagama, Ja-ela and Naththandiya to provide assistance to those affected and the teams are working in full swing, Sri Lanka Navy said. The relief teams are actively conducting operations to assist flood-affected individuals, including offering safe transportation to 641 people by dinghies, distributing cooked meals and dry rations to 4876 people, rescuing 03 at the risk of drowning and guiding people to secure locations. Working in coordination with DMC, the Navy has 22 relief teams on standby in the Western Naval Command, 9 teams in the Southern Naval Command, and 17 teams in the Northwestern Naval Command, totaling 48 teams, ready for immediate deployment when required.",

        "title": "Countdown to mission hunting alien life on a distant moon",
        "date": "October 14, 2024 12:18 pm",
        "content": "In a few hours, a spacecraft should blast-off from Florida on the hunt for signs of alien life. Its destination is Europa, a deeply-mysterious moon orbiting the distant planet Jupiter. Trapped under its icy surface could be a vast ocean with double the amount of water on Earth. The Europa Clipper spacecraft will chase a European mission that left last year, but using a cosmic piggyback, it will overtake and arrive first. That wont be until 2030 but what it finds could change what we know about life in our solar system. A moon five times brighter than ours Years in the making, the Europa Clipper launch was delayed at the last minute after hurricane Milton blasted Florida this week. The spacecraft was rushed indoors for shelter, but after checking the launchpad at Cape Canaveral for damage, engineers have now given the go-ahead for lift-off at 1206 local time (1706 BST) on 14 October. If we discover life so far away from the Sun, it would imply a separate origin of life to the Earth, says Mark Fox-Powell, a planetary microbiologist at the Open University. That is hugely significant, because if that happens twice in our solar system, it could mean life is really common, he says. Located 628 million km from Earth, Europa is just a bit bigger than our moon, but that is where the similarity ends. If it was in our skies, it would shine five times brighter because the water ice would reflect much more sunlight. Its icy crust is up to 25km thick, and sloshing beneath, there could be a vast saltwater ocean. There may also be chemicals that are the ingredients for simple life. Scientists first realised Europa might support life in the 1970s when, peering through a telescope in Arizona, they saw water ice. Voyager 1 and 2 spacecrafts captured the first close-up images, and then in 1995 Nasas Galileo spacecraft flew past Europa taking some deeply puzzling pictures. They showed a surface riddled with dark, reddish-brown cracks; fractures that may contain salts and sulfur compounds that could support life. The James Webb telescope has since taken pictures of what might be plumes of water ejected 100 miles (160 kilometers) above the moons surface. But none of those missions got close enough to Europa for long enough to really understand it. Flying through plumes of water Now scientists hope that instruments on Nasas Clipper spacecraft will map almost the entire moon, as well as collect dust particles and fly through the water plumes. Britney Schmidt, associate professor of earth and atmospheric sciences at Cornell university in the US, helped to design a laser onboard that will see through the ice. Im most excited about understanding Europas plumbing. Wheres the water? Europa has the ice version of Earths subduction zones, magma chambers and tectonics - were going to try to see into those regions and map them, she says. Her instrument, which is called Reason, was tested in Antarctica. But unlike on Earth, all the instruments on Clipper will be exposed to huge amounts of radiation which Prof Schmidt says is a major concern. The spacecraft should fly past Europa about 50 times, and each time, it will be blasted with radiation equivalent to one million X-rays. Much of the electronics are in a vault thats heavily shielded to keep out radiation, Prof Schmidt explains. The spaceship is the largest ever built to visit a planet and has a long journey ahead. Travelling 1.8 billion miles, it will orbit both the Earth and Mars to propel itself further towards Jupiter in what is called the sling-shot effect. It cannot carry enough fuel to motor itself all the way alone, so it will piggyback off the momentum of Earth and Marss gravitational pull. It will overtake JUICE, the European Space Agencys spaceship that will also visit Europa on its way to another of Jupiters moons called Ganeymede. Once Clipper approaches Europa in 2030 it will switch on its engines again to carefully manoeuvre itself into the right orbit. Space scientists are very cautious when talking about the chances of discovering life- there is no expectation that they will find human-like creatures or animals We are searching for the potential for habitability and you need four things - liquid water, a heat source, and organic material. Finally those three ingredients need to be stable over a long enough period of time that something can happen, explains Michelle Dougherty, professor of space physics at Imperial College in London. And they hope that if they can understand the ice surface better, they will know where to land a craft on a future mission. An international team of scientists with Nasa, the Jet Propulsion Lab and the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Lab will oversee the odyssey. At a time when there is a space launch virtually every week, this mission promises something different, suggests Professor Fox-Powell. Theres no profit being made. This is about exploration and curiosity, and pushing back the boundaries of our knowledge of our place in the universe, he says. Source: BBC --Agencies",

        "title": "Game of Thrones dragon-forged Iron Throne fetches nearly 1.5 million at auction",
        "date": "October 14, 2024 12:22 pm",
        "content": "Game of Thrones fans came out in droves to bid on hundreds of costumes, props and other items from the series in an auction that raked in over 21 million. From Thursday through Saturday, the Heritage Auctions event in Dallas featured over 900 lots including suits of armor, swords and weapons, jewelry and several other items of significance from the HBO series. The top-dollar item was the very thing the characters in the series vied for throughout its eight-season run: the Iron Throne. After a six-minute bidding war, the throne sold for 1.49 million. The replica was made of plastic and molded from the original screen-used version, then finished off with metallic paint and jewel embellishments. In the series, the throne was forged with dragon breath that melted the swords of a thousand vanquished challengers and became a symbol of the struggle for power throughout the shows run. Heritage Auctions said in a statement Sunday that the event brought in 21.1 million from more than 4,500 bidders. The auction marked Heritages second-best entertainment event, just shy of the record set by a Debbie Reynolds sale it held in 2011. Heritage Executive Vice President Joe Maddalena said in a statement he knew the auction would resonate. These are extraordinary treasures made by Emmy-winning costume designers and prop makers, who worked tirelessly to adapt George R.R. Martins wonderful novels, Maddalena said. People wanted a piece of that Game of Thrones magic. Beyond the coveted Iron Throne, over 30 other lots commanded six-figure price tags. Jon Snows signature sword, Longclaw, wielded onscreen by Kit Harington, sold for 400,000 and his nights watch ensemble, featuring a heavy cape, went for 337,500. Both items kicked off prolonged bidding wars. Starting bids ranged from 500 to 20,000, but several items went for thousands of dollars more. Such was the case for several cloaks and dresses worn by Emilia Clarke as Daenerys Targaryen and Lena Headey as Cersei Lannister. A gray suede ensemble worn by Daenerys sold for 112,500, exactly 100,000 over its starting bid, and the red velvet dress Cersei wears in her final appearance on the show went for 137,500, which was 122,500 over its starting bid. Suits of armor also proved popular, especially when they included sought-after weapons. Jaime Lannisters black-leather armor ensemble fetched 275,000 and his Kingsguard armor  including his iconic Oathkeeper longsword  went for 212,500. Queensguard armor worn by the character Gregor The Mountain Clegane sold for 212,500. In an interview when the auction was announced in September, Jay Roewe, HBOs senior vice president of global incentives and production planning, said the sale speaks to the series staying power five years after its finale. Game of Thrones was a zeitgeist moment in our culture. It was a zeitgeist moment in high-end television. It was a zeitgeist moment in terms of HBO, he said. Its impacted the culture.

        "date": "October 14, 2024 12:49 pm",
        "content": "The Commissioner General of Examinations Amith Jayasundara announced that it was decided not to re-conduct the 2024 Grade 05 Scholarship Examination. Furthermore, it has been decided to award free marks to all students for the 03 questions which were alleged to have been leaked. Meanwhile, the evaluation of answer sheets, which had been temporarily suspended, is reportedly expected to commence immediately. Several committees were appointed to investigate the scholarship examination, and their final conclusion was that only three questions had been leaked prior to the exam. On September 20, an investigation was launched by the Department of Examinations after it was alleged that a question paper from the exam had been leaked. Later, the initial investigation report was handed over to the Criminal Investigation Department (CID), which also launched a separate investigation into the matter. Meanwhile, the paper marking process of the Grade 5 Scholarship Examination, which was held on September 15, had been temporarily suspended, pending the investigation. The Director of the Planning Division of the National Institute of Education (NIE) in Maharagama and a school teacher, who were arrested by the Criminal Investigations Department (CID) over the question paper issue, were remanded until October 22. The arrested 58-year-old NIE Director was a member of the committee which prepared the 2024 Grade 05 Scholarship Examination paper, and the 49-year-old teacher had been conducting tuition classes for Grade 05 students. The investigations had uncovered that only three questions from the exam had been leaked in advance. However, a group of parents, holding press conferences and staging protests on several occasions, had claimed that the entire question paper had been leaked. The parents raised the issue with President Anura Kumara Dissanayake, and as a result, the evaluation of the answer sheets for the scholarship examination was suspended until the investigation was completed. This years scholarship exam was held on September 15 at 2,849 centers across the island, with 323,879 candidates participating.",

        "date": "October 14, 2024 02:03 pm",
        "content": "Kamindu Mendis beat out tough competition from Sri Lanka teammate Prabath Jayasuriya and Australias Travis Head to claim the monthly award, with the stylish left-hander adding to the honour he claimed in March earlier this year. Mendis played in four Tests during the month, scoring 451 runs at an average of 90.20, helping his side to a consolation win at The Oval in England before playing his part in a superb series triumph against New Zealand back in Sri Lanka. Mendis was thrilled to win the award for the second time this year and is already working hard on achieving even greater things within his cricketing career. I am honoured to be once again chosen as the ICC Mens Player of the Month, and this accolade brings me immense happiness and pride, as I believe all the hard work that was put into becoming the player that I am today is starting to pay off and being recognised consistently in the global stage, he said. This recognition gives me further strength to continue my good work on the cricketing field and aspire for bigger achievements, thus helping my team win games and bring glory to our country and happiness to our fans. During September, Mendis became the first mens player in history to pass fifty in each of the first eight matches of his Test career. And during the month he became the fastest batter in 75 years to bring up 1000 Test runs  doing so in just eight Tests and matching Don Bradmans effort of reaching the landmark in 13 innings. His biggest score of the month was a dominant 182 in Sri Lankas mammoth first-innings total of 6025 declared in the second Test against New Zealand, a knock that helped set up a convincing win. But arguably more impressive was his 114 in the first innings of the first Test of that series. His side had been in trouble at 883 when Mendis came in to bat, with Angelo Mathews also having retired hurt. No other batter on either side reached triple figures in the match, which Sri Lankan went on to win by just 63 runs. --ICC--",

        "title": "China launches war games around Taiwan drawing anger in Taipei, concern from US",
        "date": "October 14, 2024 02:59 pm",
        "content": "Chinas military launched a new round of war games near Taiwan on Monday, saying it was a warning to the separatist acts of Taiwan independence forces, drawing condemnation from the Taipei and U.S. governments. Democratically governed Taiwan, which China views as its own territory, had been on alert for more war games since last weeks national day speech by President Lai Ching-te. Lais address was condemned by Beijing after he said China had no right to represent Taiwan even as he offered to cooperate with Beijing. The Chinese militarys Eastern Theatre Command said the Joint Sword-2024B drills were taking place in the Taiwan Strait and areas to the north, south and east of Taiwan. The drill also serves as a stern warning to the separatist acts of Taiwan independence forces. It is a legitimate and necessary operation for safeguarding state sovereignty and national unity, it said in a statement carried both in Chinese and English. In a parallel move on Monday, Beijing sanctioned a prominent Taiwan tech tycoon Robert Tsao and a lawmaker for separatist activities. The command did not state when the drills would end. It published a map showing nine areas around Taiwan where the drills were taking place - two on the islands east coast, three on the west coast, one to the north and three around Taiwan-controlled islands next to the Chinese coast. Chinese warship formations, destroyers and aircraft are approaching Taiwan in close proximity from different directions, focusing on sea-air combat-readiness patrols, blockading key ports and areas, assaulting maritime and ground targets, the command added. A military announcement later confirmed that Chinas Liaoning aircraft carrier and supporting ships were operating east of Taiwan. However, it did not announce any live-fire exercises or any no fly areas. In 2022, shortly after then-U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan, China fired missiles over the island. Coast Guard Incursions In a major move, Chinas coast guard circled Taiwan and staged law enforcement patrols close to Taiwans offshore islands of Matsu and Dongyin, entering the restricted waters of Matsu island for the first time to completely tear up boundaries set by Taiwan authorities, according to state broadcaster CCTV. CCTV added that China may carry out regular law enforcement patrols around Matsu in future. Taiwans defence ministry and coast guard said both agencies had dispatched their own forces while officials said Lais National Security Council met on Monday to discuss the situation. Taiwans President Lai Ching-te condemned the exercises and said they are intended to undermine regional peace and stability and continue to coerce neighbouring countries by force. National Security Council Secretary-General Joseph Wu said China had ignored Lais message of goodwill. Using military force to threaten other countries goes against the basic spirit of the United Nations charter to peacefully resolve disputes, he told reporters. Chinese state media said the rocket force carried out simulated missile launches while fighter jets opened up air assault corridors and bombers carried out long range missions. In a propaganda video, the Eastern Theatre Command showed a cartoon caricature of Lai with pointed ears like a devil and fighter jets and warships around the island. A Taiwan security source said there were no signs so far of any missile launches. Security analysts are watching Chinese operations closely given its broader build-up of missile capabilities and efforts by the U.S. and its allies to improve defences against them. Blatant Provocations Taiwans China policy making Mainland Affairs Council said Chinas latest war games and refusal to renounce the use of force were blatant provocations that seriously undermined regional peace and stability. Taiwans presidential office said in a statement that China should face up to the fact of the existence of the Republic of China - Taiwans formal name - and respect the people of Taiwans choice of a free and democratic way of life. It should refrain from military provocations that would disrupt the status quo of peace and stability in the region, and threaten Taiwans democratic freedoms, the statement said. In Washington, officials from the administration of U.S. President Joe Biden said they were monitoring the drills and there was no justification for them after Lais routine speech. We call on the PRC to act with restraint and to avoid any further actions that may undermine peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait and in the broader region, which is essential to regional peace and prosperity and a matter of international concern, State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said, using the initials for the Peoples Republic of China, Chinas official name. A senior Taiwan security official, speaking to Reuters on condition of anonymity given the sensitivity of the situation, said they believed China was practicing blockading Taiwanese ports to the north and south of the island and international shipping lanes as well as repelling the arrival of foreign forces. Taiwans stock exchange largely brushed off the tensions, with the benchmark index rising 0.3, and there was no sign of public alarm. I am actually worried that there might be accidental fire between the two sides, but I have total confidence in our country and our national army, said finance worker Ben Lai, 51, watching jets land and take off at the Hsinchu air base. Taiwan on Sunday had reported a Chinese aircraft carrier group sailing to the islands south through the strategic Bashi Channel which separates Taiwan from the Philippines and connects the South China Sea to the Pacific. The PLAs Liberation Army Daily newspaper wrote on Monday that those who play with fire get burned! As long as the Taiwan independence provocations continue, the PLAs actions to defend national sovereignty and territorial integrity will not stop, the paper said. China held the Joint Sword-2024A drills for two days around Taiwan in May shortly after Lai took office, saying they were punishment for separatist content in his inauguration speech. Lai has repeatedly offered talks with China but has been rebuffed. He says only Taiwans people can decide their future and rejects Beijings sovereignty claims. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "content": "Daron Acemoglu, Simon Johnson and James Robinson won the 2024 Nobel economics prize for studies of how institutions are formed and affect prosperity, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said on Monday. The prestigious award, formally known as the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel, is the final prize to be given out this year and is worth 11 million Swedish crowns (1.1 million). Reducing the vast differences in income between countries is one of our times greatest challenges. The laureates have demonstrated the importance of societal institutions for achieving this, said Jakob Svensson, Chair of the Committee for the Prize in Economic Sciences. The economics award is not one of the original prizes for science, literature and peace created in the will of dynamite inventor and businessman Alfred Nobel and first awarded in 1901, but a later addition established and funded by Swedens central bank in 1968. Past winners include a host of influential thinkers such as Milton Friedman, John Nash - played by actor Russell Crowe in the 2001 film A Beautiful Mind - and, more recently, former U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke. Last year, Harvard economic historian Claudia Goldin won the prize for her work highlighting the causes of wage and labour market inequality between men and women. The economics prize has been dominated by U.S. academics since its inception, while U.S.-based researchers also tend to account for a large portion of winners in the scientific fields for which 2024 laureates were announced last week. That crop of prizes began with U.S. scientists Victor Ambros and Gary Ruvkun winning the prize for medicine on Monday and concluded with Japans Nihon Hidankyo, an organisation of survivors from Hiroshima and Nagasaki who campaigned for the abolition of nuclear weapons landing the award for peace on Friday.

        "date": "October 14, 2024 04:29 pm",
        "content": "Sri Lankas Minister of Foreign Affairs Vijitha Herath says that the government deeply regrets the attacks that injured two Sri Lankan peacekeepers in the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL). Speaking during an interaction with the Colombo-based Diplomatic Corps at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs held this morning (14), Minister Herath added: We are proud of our peacekeepers who serve in several challenging UN Missions and it is important that the obligation of all parties to respect UN personnel and UN premises is respected. Furthermore, the Foreign Affairs Minister stated that on the international front, Sri Lanka continues to remain highly concerned about the current global situation, particularly in the Middle East region. The humanitarian situation in Gaza is turning more dire by the day, and recent developments that have an impact on wider regional dimensions, in particular in Lebanon are most concerning, he said. He also highlighted that Sri Lanka continues calling for an immediate ceasefire and unrestricted humanitarian access to Gaza and a sustainable two-state solution that includes the establishment of an independent sovereign and viable State of Palestine, based on the 1967 borders, in line with relevant UN resolutions as well as ensuring the security of Israel. Commenting regarding Sri Lankas chairmanship of the Indian Ocean Rim Association (IORA), the Minister informed that, due to the upcoming Parliamentary Elections, the meeting of the IORA Council of Ministers will be postponed until next year. He mentioned that the timeframe is to be decided in consultation with IORA Members and the Secretariat. Speaking on the recent developments of Sri Lankas debt restructuring, Herath emphasized that the process is very near completion, enabling the government to proceed towards the third review of the IMF program, further cementing economic stability, and reinforcing the foundation for sustainable, inclusive economic recovery and growth. Earlier this month, the Official Creditor Committee (OCC) and the IMF have confirmed that the Agreements reached with Sovereign bond holders is in line with the comparability of treatment requirements and debt sustainability targets respectively. This in simple words means that the debt restructuring process is very near completion, he added. Additionally, the Minister said: In another positive step, the World Bank signed the agreement on the RESET (Second Resilience, Stability, and Economic Turnaround) Development Policy Operation (DPO) amounting to 200 million. This is aimed at implementing a reform program including economic governance, enhancing growth, and protecting the poor and vulnerable. As the program is proceeding satisfactorily, this was the second operation to be disbursed of the two-part series. The Government is keen to ensure that these stabilization measures go hand in hand with improving the standard of living of all Sri Lankans and will implement practical programs to alleviate the heavy economic burden faced by them. We are committed to ensuring that economic growth is truly inclusive, which will at the same time drive growth and investment, with the confidence of our private sector and business community, Minister Herath added.",

        "date": "October 14, 2024 04:57 pm",
        "content": "The Assistant Secretary General of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), Kanni Wignaraja, has met with President Anura Kumara Dissanayake this morning (14) at the Presidential Secretariat. The discussion primarily focused on governance, constitutional reforms, and the countrys electoral system, according to the Presidents Media Division (PMD) stated. The UNDP representative presented the report on Understanding Multidimensional Vulnerabilities: Impact on the People of Sri Lanka to President Dissanayake. Based on the findings of this report, the UNDP assured its support for Sri Lankas development efforts. A key point of discussion was the low level of womens participation in the economy. The UNDP noted that rural women face significant challenges in financial literacy, limiting their involvement in economic activities. The farming sector, in particular, suffers from poor economic literacy, resulting in underrepresentation in the national economy. The UNDP expressed willingness to assist with digitalization programs, highlighting it as a critical tool to minimize corruption, the statement said. Discussing Sri Lankas low agricultural productivity compared to other Asian nations, President Dissanayake explained that many farmers have small plots of land and do not view farming as their primary source of income. To address this, the government plans to strengthen farmers associations, which would help improve bargaining power and agricultural activities, the PMD reported. Discussing reforms to the electoral system, President Dissanayake pointed out such reforms should ensure inclusive representation of ethnic and religious communities. Addressing concerns over the microfinance sector, the President explained the interests are unfair and that the current administration plans to establish a new development bank to support the microfinance sector, with a focus on greater involvement of women. The government also plans to provide Treasury guarantees for the best proposals submitted by women entrepreneurs to help them secure capital. The UNDP reaffirmed its commitment to supporting the governments reforms, anti-corruption efforts, and increasing womens participation in both the economy and Parliament, said the PMD. Resident Representative of the UNDP in Sri Lanka, Azusa Kubota, along with Team Leader for Strategic Engagement, Digital, and Innovation, Fadhil Bakeer Markar also participated in the discussion. --PMD--",

        "date": "October 14, 2024 05:16 pm",
        "content": "Pakistans capital was under strict security lockdown as Chinese Premier Li Qiang landed in the city on Monday ahead of a heads-of-government gathering of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation this week. Lis visit is the first by a Chinese premier to Pakistan in 11 years, Pakistans Prime Ministers Office said. Pakistans Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif received Li at the airport. The government has announced a three-day public holiday in Islamabad, with schools and businesses shut and large contingents of police and paramilitary forces deployed. Pakistan army troops will be responsible for the security of the capitals Red Zone, the location of the parliament and a diplomatic enclave and where most of the meetings will take place, according to the interior ministry. The threat alert has been high in the South Asian nation ahead of the SCO summit, especially after the killing of two Chinese engineers and shooting to death of 21 miners. Security for Chinese nationals has been enhanced, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar told a news conference on Monday, saying the PM Sharif has taken a deep, keen, personal focus on their security. I believe that (the) Chinese premiers visit will be a landmark visit, he said, terming it a turning point in our relationship. He said a high-level investigation is taking place into the recent attacks on Chinese nationals and added that, I think our Chinese friends are also somewhat satisfied on the keen interest we are taking and the special focus we have placed on security. Tensions have mounted after jailed former Prime Minister Imran Khan called for a protest on Oct. 15 to press for his release and agitate against the coalition government, following violent clashes between his party loyalists and security forces. Islamabad has sought to curb all movement of Chinese nationals in the city, citing fears they could be targets for violence from separatist militants. The 23rd meeting of the SCO, which comprises nine full members including China, India, Iran and Russia, is scheduled for Tuesday and Wednesday in Islamabad. As well as attending the SCO summit, Prime Minister Li is also undertaking a four-day bilateral visit to Pakistan from Monday to Thursday, accompanied by senior officials, Pakistans foreign office said. Li and Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif will lead their respective delegations to discuss economic and trade ties and cooperation under the China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), a 65 billion investment in the South Asian country under Chinese President Xi Jinpings Belt and Road Initiative. Li will also inaugurate the CPEC-funded Gwadar International Airport in restive southwestern Balochistan province, which borders Afghanistan and Iran, Pakistans prime ministers office said. The SCO participants will be represented by the prime ministers of China, Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan as well as the first vice president of Iran and external affairs minister of India, the foreign office said.

        "date": "October 14, 2024 06:54 pm",
        "content": "The Chinese Embassy in Colombo says that China is closely following the recent arrests of Chinese nationals in Sri Lanka for suspected online fraud and is supporting Sri Lankan law enforcement agencies in cracking down on them, while ensuring their rights and interests are protected in accordance with the law. Issuing a statement in this regard, the Chinese Embassy highlighted that these cases not only pose a threat to the property of the two peoples, but also seriously damage Chinas image and affect the traditional friendship between the two countries. Furthermore, the statement mentioned that the Chinese Embassy provides full support to Sri Lankan law enforcement agencies in resolutely cracking down on suspects while protecting their legitimate rights and interests in accordance with the law. The Chinese Embassy in Colombo further said in the statement: The Telecom and online fraud began to appear in China in the 1990s and has thereafter spread wildly and affected a large number of citizens. The Chinese government adheres to a people-centered approach, continuously explores the path of cracking down on crimes of telecom and online fraud and advances various tasks in depth with unprecedented efforts, which has led to unprecedented historical achievements. The number of cases solved in China in 2021 was five times that of five years ago. The incidence of such cases in China has declined year on year for 17 consecutive months since June 2021, showing effective curbing of the trend of frequent occurrences. In the world today, crimes of telecom and online fraud are rapidly developing and spreading in various countries and have become a worldwide common danger and a global problem to solve. China has carried out fruitful cooperation with many countries, including Myanmar, Cambodia, and the United Arab Emirates, to combat such fraud in recent years. A great deal criminal gangs were smashed and significant results were achieved, but some criminal groups moved to peripheral countries in Southeast Asia as a result, it added. Additionally, the Chinese Embassy further emphasized that due to Sri Lankas advantages in telecommunications infrastructure, geographical location, and friendly relations with China, as well as the public lack of awareness to online fraud, some electronic fraud criminal gangs have moved to Sri Lanka and continue to engage in fraud activities targeting Chinese citizens at home and abroad. The Chinese mission in Sri Lanka also said that this is also an important reason for the recent trend of multiple telecom fraud cases in Sri Lanka. The Chinese government attaches great importance to this trend, and actively promotes China-Sri Lanka anti-online fraud law enforcement cooperation. In order to effectively crack down on telecom fraud and create a strong deterrent, the Ministry of Public Security of China sent a working group in September, to jointly carry out a special operation with the Sri Lankan police. A large number of criminal suspects were arrested. The repatriation and other work are being steadily advanced. This cooperation has just begun and is far from over, the statement said. In the era of globalization, no country can remain insulated. China and Sri Lanka enjoy a traditional friendship. Cooperation in various fields is very close. Our two countries have always supported each other to bring benefits to our two peoples, the Chinese Embassy said in the statement. Furthermore, the statement highlighted that China stands ready to further strengthening law enforcement cooperation with Sri Lanka and taking swift and effective actions to jointly address this problem. The Chinese Embassy further stated that China also hopes to gain understanding and support from the Sri Lankan government and people, especially the police and media in this regard.",

        "date": "October 14, 2024 07:00 pm",
        "content": "SpaceX in its fifth Starship test flight on Sunday returned the rockets towering first stage booster back to its Texas launch pad for the first time using giant mechanical arms, achieving another novel engineering feat in the companys push to build a reusable moon and Mars vehicle. The rockets first stage Super Heavy booster lifted off at 7:25 a.m. CT (1225 GMT) from SpaceXs Boca Chica, Texas launch facilities, sending the Starship second stage rocket toward space before separating at an altitude of roughly 70 km (40 miles) to begin its return to land - the most daring part of the test flight. The Super Heavy booster re-lit three of its 33 Raptor engines to slow its speedy descent back to SpaceXs launch site, as it targeted the launch pad and tower it had blasted off from. The tower, taller than the Statue of Liberty at over 400 feet, is fitted with two large metal arms at the top. With its engines roaring, the 233 foot (71 metres)-tall Super Heavy booster fell into the launch towers enclosing arms, hooking itself in place by tiny, protruding bars under the four forward grid fins it had used to steer itself through the air. The tower has caught the rocket!! CEO Elon Musk wrote on X after the catch attempt. SpaceX engineers watching the companys live stream roared in applause. The novel catch-landing method marked the latest advance in SpaceXs test-to-failure development campaign for a fully reusable rocket designed to loft more cargo into orbit, ferry humans to the moon for NASA and eventually reach Mars - the ultimate destination envisioned by Musk. Meanwhile Starship, the rocket systems second stage or top half, cruised at roughly 17,000 miles per hour 89 miles up in space, heading for the Indian Ocean near western Australia to demonstrate about 90 minutes into flight a controlled splashdown. As Starship reentered Earths atmosphere horizontally, onboard cameras showed a smooth, pinkish-purple hue of superhot plasma blanketing the ships Earth-facing side and its two steering flaps, intense hypersonic friction displayed in a glowing aura. The ships hot side is coated with 18,000 heat-shielding tiles that were improved since SpaceXs last test in June, when Starship completed its first full test flight to the Indian Ocean but suffered tile damage that made its reentry difficult. Starship this time appeared more intact upon re-igniting one of its six Raptor engines to position itself upright for the simulated ocean landing. The SpaceX live stream showed the rocket touching down in the nighttime waters far off Australias coast, then toppling on its side, concluding its test mission. A separate camera view from a vessel near the touchdown site then showed the ship exploding into a vast fireball, as SpaceX engineers could be heard on the live stream screaming in celebration. It was unclear whether the explosion was a controlled detonation or the result of a fuel leak. Musk said the ship landed precisely on target! Starship, first unveiled by Musk in 2017, has exploded several times in various stages of testing on past flights, but successfully completed a full flight in June for the first time. The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration on Saturday approved SpaceXs launch license for the fifth test, following weeks of tension between the company and its regulator over the pace of launch approvals and fines related to SpaceXs workhorse rocket, the Falcon 9.

        "date": "October 14, 2024 10:21 pm",
        "content": "India ordered the expulsion of six Canadian diplomats on Monday and withdrew its own envoy from Canada, in response to what it said was Ottawas decision to name him and others as persons of interest in an investigation. India did not go into detail on the investigation, but relations have been fraught since 2023, when Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said he had evidence linking Indian agents to the assassination of a Sikh separatist leader on his territory. India has long denied Trudeaus accusation. On Monday it dismissed Canadas move on the inquiry and accused Trudeau of pursuing a political agenda. We have no faith in the current Canadian Governments commitment to ensure their security. Therefore, the Government of India has decided to withdraw the High Commissioner and other targeted diplomats and officials, Indias foreign ministry said in a statement. It later said it had asked the six Canadian diplomats to leave by Saturday. It also said it had summoned Canadian Charge dAffaires Stewart Wheeler to protest. Canadas government has not publicly confirmed that it has named any Indian official as a person of interest. Wheeler on Monday reiterated Trudeaus accusation, saying in a statement: Canada has provided credible, irrefutable evidence of ties between agents of the Government of India and the murder of a Canadian citizen on Canadian soil. Now, it is time for India to live up to what it said it would do and look into those allegations. India has repeatedly said Canada has not shared any evidence to back its claim. This latest step follows interactions that have again witnessed assertions without any facts. This leaves little doubt that on the pretext of an investigation, there is a deliberate strategy of smearing India for political gains, Indias foreign ministry said earlier on Monday. Canada withdrew more than 40 diplomats from India in October 2023 after New Delhi asked Ottawa to reduce its diplomatic presence. In June, a committee of Canadian parliamentarians named India and China as the main foreign threats to its democratic institutions, based on input from intelligence agencies. The U.S. has also alleged that Indian agents were involved in an attempted assassination plot of another Sikh separatist leader in New York in 2023, and said it had indicted an Indian national working at the behest of an unnamed Indian government official. India expressed concern after the U.S. raised the issue, dissociating itself from the plot, and has launched an investigation. The accusations of assassination plots against Sikh separatist leaders in Canada and the U.S. have tested their relationship with India as they look to forge deeper ties with the country to counter Chinas rising global influence.

Last month I participated in one meeting with India in New Delhi, and we are going to establish the highway and railway line connectivity between Rameswaram in India and Trincomalee in Sri Lanka, B. K. Prabath Chandrakeerthi told Mint.

Indian businessmen can also get some benefits from Sri Lanka as well, Chandrakeerthi added. The Sri Lankan government proposed a land bridge between Rameswaram in Tamil Nadu of India and Talaimannar, a village in Mannar Island of Sri Lanka in 2002 and signed an agreement on it. As per the agreement, road and rail bridge links were to be developed, offering economic benefits to both sides of the Palk Strait. However, after the agreement was signed, the Tamil Nadu government opposed the construction of the land bridge. As per the agreement, road and rail bridge links were to be developed, offering economic benefits to both sides of the Palk Strait. However, after the agreement was signed, the Tamil Nadu government opposed the construction of the land bridge. The talks resumed in 2015 when Indian asked the Asian Development Bank to carry out pre-feasibility study for financing a road and rail link between Indias Rameswaram and Sri Lankas Talaimannar. But it has been decided to build the rail and road link up to Trincomalee, the official informed. There is no land connection between Sri Lanka and India through road or railway. The closest Indian town to Sri Lanka, Dhanushkodi, had a railway station but this was washed out in a cyclone in 1964. A short boat ride till 1966 connected the railway stations at Talaimannar in Sri Lanka and Dhanushkodi in India. The cost of the project is still not finalized. We have to have more discussion about that, but I think it is estimated to be nearly 5 billion, the Lankan official said, and added: It will entirely be borne by the Indian government. We have to get some approval for environmental clearance. He said the project may involve bridges and underwater tunnels to allow unhindered movement of ships. Queries sent to the spokespeople and secretaries of Indian road transport and highways, ports, shipping and waterways, railways, external affairs and environment ministries remained unanswered at press time.

        "date": "October 15, 2024 11:18 am",
        "content": "Sri Lankas government has moved forward with plans to enhance its public debt management capabilities, following the enactment of the Public Debt Management Act No. 33 of 2024. Under the provisions of Section 23 of the Act, the establishment of a Public Debt Management Office (PDMO) is mandated to ensure the timely, accurate, and detailed recording of public debt data through an efficient system. Currently, Sri Lanka utilizes the Commonwealth Secretariat Debt Recording and Management System (CS-DRMS) to manage its foreign debt, a system maintained by the Department of Foreign Resources. However, the Commonwealth Secretariat has recently suspended updates and annual license extensions for CS-DRMS, prompting the need for an upgraded system. Accordingly, discussions have been held with technical missions from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank on the establishment of the PDMO. Two potential software options have emerged as viable replacements for the current system: the Commonwealth Meridian software, offered by the Commonwealth Secretariat, and the Debt Management and Financial Analysis System (DMFAS) from the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD). After careful consideration, the government has recommended the adoption of the Commonwealth Meridian software. This decision is based on several factors, including cost-effectiveness, ease of data transmission, data integrity, and the ability to seamlessly integrate with existing systems, according to the Cabinet Office of Sri Lanka. Thus, the Cabinet of Ministers, who met on Monday (14), has approved the proposal presented by President Anura Kumara Dissanayake as the Minister of Finance to procure the Commonwealth Meridian software. The Cabinet of Ministers has approved the proposal and will proceed with obtaining recommendations from a procurement committee appointed by the Cabinet to finalize the acquisition process, the Cabinet Office said, noting that this move is expected to significantly bolster Sri Lankas ability to manage its public debt more efficiently, ensuring greater transparency and accuracy in debt reporting.",

        "date": "October 15, 2024 11:51 am",
        "content": "North Korea has blown up sections of inter-Korean roads and rail lines on its side of the heavily fortified border between the two Koreas, South Koreas military said on Tuesday, ratcheting up tensions on the Korean peninsula. At around midday, some northern parts of the roads and rail lines connected to the South were blown up, the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) said in a message sent to media. In response, South Koreas military fired warning shots south of the military demarcation line dividing the neighbours, though the explosions had not caused any damage on Seouls side of the border, it said. The explosions came after Pyongyang pledged last week to completely cut off the inter-Korean roads and railways and further fortify the areas on its side of the border. Seoul had warned on Monday that the North was getting ready for a detonation. The North has already been installing landmines and barriers along the border, and was seen on Monday doing additional work with heavy equipment, South Koreas JCS said. The South had ramped up surveillance and readiness after the incident, it said. The two Koreas are still technically at war after their 1950-53 war ended in an armistice, not a peace treaty. The cross-border links are remnants of periods of rapprochement between the countries including a 2018 summit between the leaders when they declared there would be no more war and a new era of peace had opened. Around 180 billion won (132 million) in taxpayers money was spent by South Korea to rebuild the inter-Korean road, according to the Yonhap news agency. There has been an escalating war of words between the Koreas after the North accused its rival of sending drones over the countrys capital Pyongyang. North Korea on Friday said the drones had scattered a huge number of anti-North leaflets, in what it called political and military provocation that could lead to armed conflict. A spokesman for the Souths JCS declined on Monday to answer questions over whether the South Korean military or civilians had flown the alleged drones. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un had overseen on Monday a meeting with defence and security officials to discuss how to respond to the enemys serious provocation that violated the sovereignty of the DPRK, state media KCNA reported. DPRK is short for the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea, North Koreas official name. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "date": "October 15, 2024 12:50 pm",
        "content": "Striking images from the Sahara Desert show large lakes etched into rolling sand dunes after one of the most arid, barren places in the world was hit with its first floods in decades. The Sahara does experience rain, but usually just a few inches a year and rarely in late summer. Over two days in September, however, intense rain fell in parts of the desert in southeast Morocco, after a low pressure system pushed across northwestern Sahara. Preliminary NASA satellite data showed nearly 8 inches of rain in some parts of the region. Errachidia, a desert city in southeast Morocco, recorded nearly 3 inches of rainfall, most of it across just two days last month. Thats more than four times the normal rainfall for the whole month of September, and equates to more than half a years worth for this area. Its been 30 to 50 years since weve had this much rain in such a short space of time, Houssine Youabeb from Moroccos meteorology agency told AP last week. As the rain flowed over the desert terrain, it created a new, watery landscape amid the palm trees and scrubby flora. Some of the most dramatic images are from the desert town of Merzouga, where the rare deluge carved new lakes into the sand dunes. The reflections of the towns palm trees now shimmer across the expanse of a new lagoon, framed by steep sand dunes. The rain also filled lakes that are normally dry, such as one in Iriqui National Park, Moroccos largest national park. NASA satellite images from the region, using false color to better highlight the floodwaters, show newly-formed lakes across swaths of the northwest Sahara. While much of the rain fell on sparsely-populated remote areas, some fell on Moroccos towns and villages causing deadly flooding last month, which killed more than a dozen people. The Sahara is the worlds largest non-polar desert, stretching across 3.6 million square miles. Satellite images from September showed huge swaths of it carpeted in green as storms pushed further north than usual, a phenomenon some studies have linked to human-caused climate change. More extreme rainfall events could be expected in the Sahara in the future, according to recent research, as fossil fuel pollution continues to heat up the planet and disrupt the water cycle.

The petitions were filed by the parents of several students who appeared for the 2024 Grade 05 Scholarship Examination which was held on September 15, 2024. The petitioners have requested the Supreme Court through their FR petition that an order be issued invalidating the question paper 01 of the 2024 Grade 05 Scholarship Examination in which certain questions are alleged to have been leaked, and that the exam be held again. Furthermore, the petition seeks an order be issued to the relevant authorities to re-conduct the question paper 02 of the examination as well, if it is uncovered during investigations that the relevant question paper has also been leaked. The petitioners also request the court to invalidate the decision taken by the Department of Examination to award free marks to all candidates who appeared for the exam for the three questions which are alleged to have been leaked. Additionally, they seek an order be issued to the respondents of the petition to submit to the court a list of names of the members of the committee appointed to investigate the alleged paper leak. The Commissioner General of Examinations, Minister of Education and Prime Minister Dr. Harini Amarasuriya, Secretary of the Ministry of Education, DIG in charge of the Criminal Investigations Department and 11 others have been named as respondents of the relevant petition. On September 20, an investigation was launched by the Department of Examinations after it was alleged that three questions of one of the question papers from the exam had been leaked. Later, the initial investigation report was handed over to the Criminal Investigation Department (CID), which also launched a separate investigation into the matter. Meanwhile, the paper marking process of the Grade 5 Scholarship Examination, which was held on September 15, had been temporarily suspended, pending the investigation. The investigations had uncovered that only three questions from the exam had been leaked in advance. However, the incident stirred controversy as a group of parents, holding press conferences and staging protests on several occasions, had claimed that the entire question paper had been leaked. Against this backdrop, the Director of the Planning Division of the National Institute of Education (NIE) in Maharagama and a school teacher, who were arrested by the Criminal Investigations Department (CID) over the question paper issue, were remanded until October 22. The arrested 58-year-old NIE Director was a member of the committee which prepared the 2024 Grade 05 Scholarship Examination paper, and the 49-year-old teacher had been conducting tuition classes for Grade 05 students. The parents raised the issue with President Anura Kumara Dissanayake, and as a result, the evaluation of the answer sheets for the scholarship examination was suspended until the investigation was completed. However on Monday (14), the Commissioner General of Examinations Amith Jayasundara announced that it was decided not to re-conduct the 2024 Grade 05 Scholarship Examination. Furthermore, it has been decided to award free marks to all students for the 03 questions which were alleged to have been leaked. Meanwhile, the evaluation of answer sheets, which had been temporarily suspended, is reportedly expected to commence immediately.",

The President further stated that public wealth must be protected like religious property, and no one has a legitimate right to subject that wealth to fraud or corruption. President Anura Kumara Dissanayake stated that the commitment of the current public servants is essential to create an efficient and effective public service that satisfies the citizens, and he is ready to take every step necessary to achieve this. The President emphasized that public servants must act with responsibility and accountability to fulfill the structure, goals, and expectations of this mandate, and stated that his political leadership team is prepared to provide the necessary leadership for this.

        "title": "K-pop star gives tearful testimony on harassment",
        "date": "October 15, 2024 06:11 pm",
        "content": "A member of the chart-topping K-pop group NewJeans has tearfully testified to South Korean lawmakers as part of an enquiry into workplace harassment. Hanni, who is 20 years old, alleged that the entertainment agency Hybe had deliberately undermined her band, and accused senior managers of deliberately ignoring her. Following multiple incidents, she said, I came to the realisation that this wasnt just a feeling. I was honestly convinced that the company hated us. After hearing her testimony, the CEO of NewJeans record label, Ador - a subsidiary of Hybe - said he would listen more closely to his artists, adding: I wonder if there was more I could have done. Ignore her Hanni, who is Vietnamese-Australian, was testifying to the Labour Committee of South Koreas National Assembly at a hearing about workplace harassment. She was called to give evidence last month, after NewJeans went public with allegations about their treatment following the dismissal of their mentor Min Hee-Jin. Min, who co-founded Ador in 2021, has been a key figure in the bands success but she was removed from her post in August, following accusations that she had planned to split from Hybe, taking NewJeans with her. Min repeatedly denied those. Then, in September, NewJeans took the unusual step of going public with their dissatisfaction at the situation. Posting on a burner YouTube account, they demanded Mins reinstatement and made claims of workplace harassment. In one incident, Hanni said that when she greeted the members of another band at their record label offices, a manager had instructed them to ignore her. The singer said that when she reported the incident, her concerns had been brushed off. During her testimony, Hanni went into further detail about the exchange. We have a floor in our building where we do hair and make-up. And at that time, I was waiting in the hallway because my hair and make-up was done first. As she waited, three singers from another band and their manager walked past., Hanni continued. I said hello to all of them, and then they came back about five or 10 minutes later. On her way out, the manager made eye contact with me, turned to the rest of the group and said, Ignore her like you didnt see her. I dont understand why she would say something like that in the work environment, she added. Speaking at the National Assemblyin Seoul, Hanni said this was not an isolated incident, and claimed that senior members of Hybe management had also given her the cold shoulder. Since my debut in NewJeans, we ran into a person in a high-up position many times, but they never greeted me when I greeted them, she said. I understood from living in Korea that I have to be polite to older people and thats part of the culture - but I think its just disrespectful as a human being to not greet us, regardless of our professional status. She continued: There was a certain vibe of disrespect that I felt within the company. Hanni further alleged that she had seen employees bad-mouthing NewJeans on Blind - an app for internal communications similar to Teams or Slack. She also said Hybes PR department had contacted a journalist, asking him to downplay NewJeans achievements in an article about their record sales. Hybe has previously denied those accusations, saying they had been attempting to correct a factual error. However, Hanni said the incident reinforced her feeling that the company hated us. Kim Joo-young, who is the current CEO of Ador, was also called to testify at the hearing. He said he believed Hannis story of being shunned by another bands manager, but had been unable to find supporting evidence. CCTV footage of the incident had expired before he had the chance to request it, he told the committee. I believe I did everything I could, but seeing that Hanni felt this way and that the situation escalated to this point, I wonder if there was more I could have done, he added. Kim also said he would co-operate with an investigation into the incident by South Koreas Ministry of Labour. The story has gripped South Korean media and fans of K-Pop - where NewJeans have emerged as one of the genres brightest new bands. With slick pop songs like Super Shy, OMG and Supernatural, they were the eighth biggest-selling act in the world last year, and were nominated for best group at this years MTV Awards. Formed by Ador in 2022, its five members - Minji, Hanni, Danielle, Haerin and Hyein - range in age from 16 to 20. Despite the behind-the-scenes drama, they have continued to release and perform music. Thats partly because they are committed to a seven-year contract, which runs out in 2029. The K-pop news site Koreaboo estimated that the members would have to pay about 300 billion South Korean Won (about 170 million) to terminate the contract early. Hanni concluded Tuesdays session by expressing her frustration at how the internal dispute had overshadowed her bands career. A lot of people have been worried about us, she said, wiping away tears. Some fans apologised for making us go through this, but Im grateful to Korea for allowing me to do what I love. The ones who should be apologising are avoiding responsibility, and that frustrates me.

        "title": "Canada expels top India diplomats, links them to murder of Sikh leader",
        "date": "October 15, 2024 08:20 pm",
        "content": "Canada expelled six Indian diplomats including the high commissioner on Monday, linking them to the murder of a Sikh separatist leader and alleging a broader effort to target Indian dissidents in Canada. Earlier in the day, India retaliated by ordering the expulsion of six high-ranking Canadian diplomats including the acting high commissioner and said it had withdrawn its envoy from Canada, contradicting Canadas statement of expulsion. The diplomatic row represents a major deterioration of relations between the two Commonwealth countries. Ties have been frayed since Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said last year he had evidence linking Indian agents to the assassination of Sikh leader Hardeep Singh Nijjar on Canadian territory. The government now has clear and compelling evidence that agents of the government of India have engaged in and continue to engage in activities that pose a significant threat to public safety, Trudeau said at a news conference. These activities involved clandestine information gathering techniques, coercive behaviour, targeting South Asian Canadians and involvement in over a dozen threatening and violent acts, including murder, he said. This is unacceptable, he said, adding that India had committed a fundamental error by engaging in criminal activities in Canada. India has long denied Trudeaus accusations. On Monday, it dismissed Canadas move on the inquiry and accused Trudeau of pursuing a political agenda. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police said in an earlier news conference the government of India had undertaken a broad campaign against Indian dissidents including homicides and extortion. It had also used organised crime to target the South Asian community in Canada and interfered in democratic processes, police said. Brigitte Gauvin, RCMPs assistant commissioner, said what we have seen is...the use of organised crime elements and named the Bishnoi group. She said the group we believe...is connected to the agents of the Government of India. Indias National Investigation Agency (NIA) says Lawrence Bishnoi is the head of an organised criminal syndicate. He is in a jail in western India awaiting trial on terrorism charges. Bishnois lawyer, Rajani, who only uses one name, said on the Canadian allegations that this matter will be investigated, the investigation agencies will look into it. Whatever is there, it will be revealed. Regarding the NIAs charges, she said cases are still being investigated and final charges have not been framed yet. Canadas foreign ministry said: The decision to expel these individuals was made with great consideration and only after the RCMP gathered ample, clear and concrete evidence which identified six individuals as persons of interest in the Nijjar case. India said it was withdrawing its diplomats from Canada because it was not confident that their safety could be guaranteed. We have no faith in the current Canadian Governments commitment to ensure their security. Therefore, the Government of India has decided to withdraw the High Commissioner and other targeted diplomats and officials, Indias foreign ministry said in a statement. India also said it had asked six Canadian diplomats to leave by Saturday. The ministry also said it had summoned Acting High Commissioner in India Stewart Wheeler, currently Canadas top diplomat in the South Asian country. Major Rupture Canadas Foreign Minister Melanie Joly said the government had requested India to remove the diplomatic immunity of six diplomats so that the Canadian investigative agencies could question them regarding the allegations of criminal activity. But since India did not co-operate, it had to expel the diplomats. Were not seeking diplomatic confrontation with India, she said. But we will not sit quietly as agents of any country are linked to efforts to threaten, harass or even kill Canadians. Canada withdrew more than 40 diplomats from India in October 2023 after New Delhi asked Ottawa to reduce its diplomatic presence. We have gone from a rift to a major rupture in the relationship with India, Fen Osler Hampson, professor of international relations at Ottawas Carleton University said in a telephone interview. It is hard to see at this juncture that a return to normalcy will happen any time in the foreseeable future. Canada is home to the highest population of Sikhs outside their home state of Punjab and demonstrations in recent years have irked Indias government The U.S. has also alleged that Indian agents were involved in an attempted assassination plot against another Sikh separatist leader in New York last year, and said it had indicted an Indian national working at the behest of an unnamed Indian government official. An Indian government committee investigating Indian involvement in the foiled murder plot will meet U.S. officials in Washington this week, the State Department said on Monday. The accusations of assassination plots against Sikh separatist leaders in Canada and the U.S. have tested their relationship with India as they look to forge deeper ties with the country to counter Chinas rising global influence.

        "content": "The Public Health Inspectors (PHIs) Association has raised concerns about the heightened risk of infectious diseases spreading following the recent floods. Sandun Ratnayake of the Public Health Inspectors Association stated that individuals exposed to floodwaters are particularly vulnerable to illnesses such as diarrhoea, dysentery, leptospirosis and worm infestations. If you experience symptoms of diarrhoea, dysentery, or suspected leptospirosis, it is essential to seek immediate medical attention, Ratnayake advised. He emphasized the importance of consuming only clean, fresh, and hot food during this period, and ensuring that water is either boiled or bottled to prevent waterborne diseases. Furthermore, he highlighted the risk of contracting leptospirosis for those with skin wounds or scratches exposed to floodwaters. If you have any open wounds and have been in contact with floodwater, theres a significant chance of contracting leptospirosis. Immediate treatment is crucial. The Disaster Management Center (DMC) reported that the heavy rainfall has affected 159,511 individuals from 40,758 families across the country. The disaster has claimed three lives, left two people injured, and displaced over 10,000 individuals, forcing 2,433 families to seek refuge in 80 temporary shelters.

President Anura Kumara Dissanayake has instructed that the airline should be an institution that all Sri Lankans are proud of, and should be owned by Sri Lankans, the airlines new chairman Sarath Ganegoda told TTG Asia. The previous government had invited bids to part-sell and manage the airline that as been suffering accumulated losses over the years. While the airline has reported an operating profit for the period April 2022 to end March 2023, its accumulated debt is US1.2 billion. Under the earlier plan, the government was to retain 51 per cent control of the airline while selling off the remaining 49 per cent to investors. Six parties, some who had no experience in running an airline, responded with an initial call for interest but none was pre-qualified for the next step of the process. Left-leaning politician Anura Kumara Dissanayake from the National People Party won last months presidential election. He had vowed to stop the sale of state assets which the former regime was pursuing. Dissanayake swiftly dismantled a government unit tasked with the sale of loss-making state agencies including SriLankan Airlines. Ganegoda said the airline is an important pillar of tourism and responsible for 50 per cent of the tourist traffic into the country. Sri Lanka aims to reach 2.3 million arrivals this year with a target of three million tourists next year and five million by 2030. He said while the sale of the airline has been stopped, there are plans to restructure the airline under a viable business model. Some structuring of our operations is needed to strengthen the balance sheet, he added. Source: TTG Asia --Agencies",

        "date": "October 16, 2024 11:02 am",
        "content": "Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese is under fire after buying a multi-million-dollar cliff-top home amid a national housing crisis. Albanese made the purchase months out from an election in which the cost of living and housing are key issues. The move has sparked backlash from across the political divide - with his opponents calling it tone deaf and some within his own party anonymously telling local media it left them gobsmacked. Albanese defended his decision, saying he knows what it is like to struggle but bought the luxury property to be close to his fiancee Jodie Haydons family on the New South Wales Central Coast. Property records show the four-bedroom, three-bathroom, and three-carport property in Copacabana - which has panoramic views - was sold for A4.3m (2.9m, 2.2m) last month, but the purchase is yet to settle. At a press conference about housing on the day news of his new home broke, Albanese said he was aware that he was better off than many Australians due to his income but that he could still empathise with their struggle. My mum lived in the one public housing home that she was born in for all of her 65 years, he told reporters. I know what it is like, which is why I want to help all Australians into a home. Albaneses Labor party has created a A10b investment fund for social and affordable housing. It has struggled to get other housing initiatives through parliament though, due in part to a lack of support from the Australian Greens party and some independents, who want the government to produce more ambitious policy proposals. Research suggests Australian cities rank among the worst in the world for housing affordability, with Sydney trailing only Hong Kong, according to the 2024 Demographia International Housing Affordability survey. About two thirds of Australian households own a home, but, according to parliamentary disclosures, about 95 of sitting federal politicians own at least one residential property. About a third own three or more. While some of his colleagues have backed Albanese, several have broken rank to criticise his decision anonymously as being out of step with the public. I cant think of a greater act of self-sabotage in my life, one Labor MP told the Sydney Morning Herald - who redacted their name so they could speak freely. If youre a Labor MP up against a Green at the next election, good luck, they added. Greens housing spokesman Max Chandler-Mather said Albaneses purchase highlights the need for reform to lucrative tax incentives for property investors and greater renter protections. Labor and the Liberals have created a housing system where a property investor can buy a A4.3m beachfront home, while millions cant even find an affordable rental, let alone buy a house of their own, Chandler-Mather wrote on X. Liberal Senator Jane Hume said everybody has a right to a personal life but questioned the timing of the purchase: This is tone deaf during a housing crisis, she told Channel 7s Sunrise programme. However, Opposition Leader and fellow Liberal Peter Dutton declined to criticise Albanese but noted that many Australians were struggling with their own mortgages. Source: BBC --Agencies",

        "date": "October 16, 2024 11:03 am",
        "content": "The US has written to Israel, giving it 30 days to boost humanitarian aid access in Gaza or risk having some US military assistance cut off. The letter, sent on Sunday, amounts to the strongest known written warning from the US to its ally and comes amid a new Israeli offensive in northern Gaza that has reportedly caused a large number of civilian casualties. It says the US has deep concerns about the deteriorating humanitarian situation, adding that Israel denied or impeded nearly 90 of humanitarian movements between the north and south last month. Israel is reviewing the letter, an Israeli official was reported as saying, adding the country takes this matter seriously and intends to address the concerns raised with US counterparts. Israel has previously said it is targeting Hamas operatives in the north and not stopping the entry of humanitarian aid. On Monday, the Israeli military body responsible for managing crossings into Gaza, Cogat, said 30 lorries carrying aid from the World Food Programme had entered northern Gaza through the Erez crossing. That ended a two-week period during which the UN said no food aid was delivered to the north, and supplies essential for survival were running out for the 400,000 Palestinians there. A UN official has said that Gaza is in a state of constant peak emergency. Antoine Renard, head of the World Food Programme (WFP) in the occupied Palestinian territories, told the AFP news agency people in the north of the territory were relying solely on assistance with practically no access to fresh food other than that provided by UN agencies. The US is by far the biggest supplier of arms to Israel, and the Israeli military has relied heavily on US-supplied aircraft, guided bombs, missiles and shells to fight the war against Hamas in Gaza over the past year. The US letter to the Israeli government - the contents of which have now been confirmed by the state department - was first reported by the Axios website. It is signed by Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin. We are now writing to underscore the US governments deep concern over the deteriorating humanitarian situation in Gaza, and seek urgent and sustained actions by your government this month to reverse this trajectory, it says. It states that Israeli evacuation orders have forced 1.7 million people into the narrow, coastal al-Mawasi area where they are at high risk of lethal contagion due to extreme overcrowding, and that humanitarian organisations report that their survival needs cannot be met. We are particularly concerned that recent actions by the Israeli government - including halting commercial imports, denying or impeding nearly 90 of humanitarian movements between northern and southern Gaza in September, continuing burdensome and excessive dual-use restrictions, and instituting new vetting and onerous liability and customs requirements for humanitarian staff and shipments - together with increased lawlessness and looting - are contributing to an accelerated deterioration in the conditions in Gaza, it adds. The letter says Israel must, starting now and within 30 days act on a series of concrete measures to boost aid supplies, adding that failure may have implications for US policy. It cites US laws which can prohibit military assistance to countries that impede delivery of US humanitarian aid. It says Israel must surge all forms of humanitarian assistance throughout Gaza before winter, including by enabling a minimum of 350 lorries a day to enter through all four major crossings and a new fifth crossing, as well as allowing people in al-Mawasi to move inland. It also calls on Israel to end the isolation of northern Gaza by reaffirming that there will be no Israeli government policy of forced evacuation of civilians from north to south. At a news conference in Washington on Tuesday, US state department spokesman Matthew Miller told reporters that the letter was a private diplomatic communication that we did not intend to make public. Secretary Blinken along with Secretary Austin thought it was appropriate to make clear to the government of Israel that there are changes they need to make again to see the level of assistance making it into Gaza comes back up, he said. Mr Miller declined to speculate on what consequences there might be for Israel if it did not boost humanitarian aid access. But he noted: Recipients of US military assistance do not arbitrarily deny or impede provisioning of US humanitarian assistance. Thats just the law and we of course will follow the law. But our hope is that Israel will make the changes that we have outlined. He also said the 30-day time limit was not linked to the upcoming US presidential election on 5 November, saying it was appropriate to give them time to work through the different issues. Israel has previously insisted there are no limits to the amount of aid or humanitarian assistance that can be delivered into and across Gaza, and blames UN agencies for failing to distribute supplies. It also accuses Hamas of stealing aid, which the group denies. Before Israels ground offensive in the southern Gaza city of Rafah in May, President Joe Biden suspended a single consignment of 2,000 and 500lb bombs for the first time as he tried to dissuade it from an all-out assault. But the president immediately faced a backlash from Republicans in Washington and from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who appeared to compare it to an arms embargo. The suspension was partially lifted in July and has not been repeated. Earlier on Tuesday, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) warned that families in northern Gaza were facing unimaginable fear, loss of loved ones, confusion, and exhaustion because of the Israeli offensive that began 10 days ago. The Israeli military says it has sent tanks and troops back into the town of Jabalia and its urban refugee camp for a third time to root out Hamas fighters who have regrouped there. It has ordered residents of Jabalia, as well as neighbouring Beit Lahia and Beit Hanoun, to evacuate to the al-Mawasi humanitarian area. The UN says about 50,000 people have fled to Gaza City and other parts of the north. But for many it is unsafe to leave their homes or they are unable to leave because they are sick or disabled. Khalid, a resident of Jabalia whose accounts of the past year are featured in a new BBC documentary, said in a voice note that he and his family had been living in fear for a week. We were told to go to the south, but we couldnt because the Israeli army has surrounded the area, either with dirt barricades or using quadcopter drones. We cant move, its too difficult. At the same time, because of the intense bombing were living in constant terror. My daughter has become sick and she has a fever. Her entire body is shaking in fear because of the sound of the bombings and I dont know what to do with her. I cant even take her to the hospital, he added. Gazas Hamas-run Civil Defence agency said its first responders had recovered the bodies of 42 people killed by Israeli air and artillery strikes in Jabalia and neighbouring areas on Tuesday. They reportedly included 11 members of the same family, nearly all of them women and children, whose home was destroyed in an air strike overnight. The Israeli military said on Tuesday that its troops had killed dozens of terrorists in the Jabalia area over the previous day. On Monday, Israeli human rights groups warned of what they called alarming signs that the Israeli military is beginning to quietly implement the Generals Plan, echoing widespread Palestinian concerns. The controversial plan calls for the forcible transfer of all civilians in the north followed by a siege of the Hamas fighters remaining there to force their surrender and the release of Israeli hostages. The Israeli military denies it is being implemented, saying it is only getting civilians out of harms way. Israel launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to the groups unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. More than 42,340 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territorys Hamas-run health ministry. Source: BBC --Agencies",

The complaint was made after the resident purchased a 65-perch plot of land in the Sathurukondan area of Batticaloa for Rs. 10 million and paid Rs. 600,000 as stamp duty. However, the provincial revenue office has later informed the resident that the assessed value of the land was Rs. 26.5 million. As a result, the official stated that a government fee of Rs. 850,000, along with a fine, had to be paid. However, a bribe of Rs. 200,000 was allegedly requested to reduce this amount to Rs. 200,000.

The 40-year-old Iranian had arrived in the island onboard Air Arabia flight G9-502 from Sharjah, United Arab Emirates, at 4:25 a.m. today. Upon arrival, the man had presented an Italian passport to immigration officers to obtain an on-arrival visa. However, when the passport details were checked against Interpols database of lost and stolen passports, it has been flagged as being reported stolen. Immigration authorities had immediately referred the case to the National Central Bureau of the Criminal Investigation Department (CID), where the stolen status of the passport was confirmed. While investigations were underway, the Iranian national had attempted to re-enter the country using his original Iranian passport. He had presented this at another immigration window, but his actions were noticed, and was brought to the attention of the officers handling his case. The Italian passport had been forwarded to the Immigration Departments Border Control Unit for further technical checks, which corroborated that the document was indeed flagged as stolen. During the investigation, officials had uncovered that the Iranian national had planned to use Sri Lanka as a transit point en route to Europe. However, the officials had taken steps to deport him back to Sharjah on the same flight he had arrived on.",

This order was issued by the Appeals Court after considering a petition filed by a private company alleging that their project is being unduly hindered by the said official. The application was taken up for consideration today (16) before an Appellate Court bench comprising Judges Mohammad Lafar Tahir and P. Kumaran Ratnam. Presenting facts before the court, Presidents Counsel Ali Sabry, who appeared for the petitioning company, accused the Gampola Divisional Secretary of obstructing the construction work of the cable car project despite the fact that all the relevant government agencies had given the necessary approval. He charged that various obstacles are being put forth while alleging that there was insufficient safety and such while several persons have also been arrested in connection with this incident and that there had been extensive media coverage regarding this. The Presidents Counsel pointed out that the area where this construction is being carried out is completely under the authority of the Urban Development Authority (UDA) and that the Gampola Divisional Secretary has no authority to interfere in its affairs. Pointing out that due to these obstructions, a situation has arisen where it is no longer possible to complete the relevant project within the stipulated time period, he requested that an interim injunction be issued to prevent obstruction and improper interference in the said project. After considering the facts presented, the court issued this interim order and also ordered that the petition be called again on October 29. Gampola Divisional Secretary Dilrukshi Jayaratne, the Sri Lanka Tourism Board and the Board of Investments (BoI) have been named as respondents in the petition.",

The new iPad mini is powered by Apples A17 Pro chip, which is used in the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max models. With a six-core central processing unit, the A17 Pro would boost CPU performance by 30 compared to the current generation iPad minis and is central to running Apple Intelligence, Apples AI software. Apple said it would roll out the first set of AI features in the U.S. version of the English language this month through a software update with iPadOS 18.1. The features will be available for iPads with A17 Pro or M1 chips and later generations, Apple said, adding it will roll out additional features including image-generation tools, Genmoji and ChatGPT-powered capabilities over the next several months. Apple in September unveiled its long-awaited, AI-boosted iPhone 16 lineup, but with the AI features still in test mode, the company failed to excite some investors while early sales data raised some questions around demand. Still, research firm Canalys on Monday said the iPhone 16 would help Apples sales in the fourth quarter and drive momentum into the first half of 2025, after Apple reached a record high third-quarter shipments. The iPad mini, starting at 499, is available for pre-orders starting on Tuesday and will begin arriving to customers and Apple store locations next week, Apple said. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "date": "October 16, 2024 07:21 pm",
        "content": "Palestinian health officials called on Wednesday for a humanitarian corridor to three hospitals in northern Gaza that have come close to collapse as Israeli troops have cut off the area during almost two weeks of heavy fighting against Hamas. Doctors at the Kamal Adwan, Al-Awda and the Indonesian hospitals have refused to leave their patients despite evacuation orders issued by the Israeli military at the start of a major push into the Jabalia area of northern Gaza 12 days ago. We are calling on the international community, the Red Cross and the World Health Organization to play their humanitarian role by opening up a corridor towards our healthcare system, said Hussam Abu Safiya, director of Kamal Adwan Hospital. We are talking about more than 300 medical staff working at Kamal Adwan Hospital, and we cant provide even a single meal for them to be able to offer medical services safely. Jabalia, home to one of Gazas eight historic refugee camps, was cleared early in the war by Israeli troops pushing through northern Gaza but Palestinian militant Hamas fighters have re-established themselves in the area. Palestinian health officials said the new Israeli offensive has killed around 350 Palestinians in Jabalia and nearby areas. In Gaza City on Wednesday, an Israeli airstrike on a house killed 13 people, medics said. In its daily update, the Gaza health ministry said Israeli military strikes had killed 65 Palestinians across the enclave in the past 24 hours. The dire humanitarian situation has prompted worldwide alarm, with the United States, Israels biggest military backer, issuing one of its strongest warnings that Israel must improve the situation or face potential restrictions on military aid. Speaking to Reuters in Istanbul, senior Hamas official Basem Naim said the U.S. demands showed that Washington and Israel had only tactical differences while looking for ways to implement the same goals. Naim said it was difficult to have faith in Washingtons call for more aid and humanitarian relief for Gaza, when it is providing billions of dollars worth of weapons and security assistance to Israel. The Israeli military says it has killed more than 50 Palestinian fighters over the past days in airstrikes and close quarters combat as troops try to root out Hamas forces operating as guerrillas in the rubble. It has told people to evacuate to what it said were safer areas in the south, fuelling fears among Palestinians that the drive is aimed at clearing them from northern Gaza permanently as part of a plan to control the enclave. Israel has denied the evacuation orders are part of a systematic clearance plan, saying they have been issued to ensure peoples safety and separate them from militants. AID SUPPLIES The Israeli military denies restricting supplies, saying that since Oct. 1, more than 9,000 tons of humanitarian aid has entered Gaza, some of it reaching northern Gaza, where the United Nations estimates some 400,000 Palestinians remain. On Wednesday, the Israeli military unit that oversees aid and commercial shipments to Gaza said 50 trucks carrying food, water, medical supplies, and shelter equipment provided by Jordan were transferred to the northern Gaza Strip. But Hadeel Obeid, a supervisor nurse at the Indonesian Hospital, where 28 patients were being treated, said Gazans in the north were starving. Our administrative manager provides just one meal for all persons including doctors, nurses, patients...Its a small amount, not enough for an adult person, she told Reuters via a messaging app. Medical supplies were running down due to the daily demands of caring for the wounded, she said. Israel launched the offensive against Hamas after the militant groups Oct. 7 attack on Israel, in which 1,200 people were killed and around 250 taken hostage to Gaza, according to Israeli tallies. More than 42,000 Palestinians have been killed in the offensive so far, according to Gazas health authorities. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

The meeting extensively covered various projects under the ministry, with a particular focus on the construction of the Kadawata-Mirigama section of the Central Expressway.

        "title": "Liam Payne, former One Direction member, dies at 31 in Argentina hotel fall",
        "date": "October 17, 2024 07:57 am",
        "content": "Former One Direction singer Liam Payne, 31, whose chart-topping British boy band generated a global following of swooning fans, was found dead Wednesday after falling from a hotel balcony in Buenos Aires, local officials said. Buenos Aires police said in a statement that Payne fell from the third floor of the Casa Sur Hotel in the trendy Palermo neighborhood of Argentinas capital, resulting in extremely serious injuries. Medics confirmed his death on the spot, the statement said. Pablo Policicchio, the communications director for the Buenos Aires Security Ministry, said in a statement to The Associated Press that Payne had jumped from the balcony of his room. Police rushed to the hotel in response to an emergency call just after 5 p.m. local time, he said, warning of an aggressive man who could be under the influence of drugs or alcohol. The hotel manager can be heard on a 911 call obtained by the AP saying they had a guest who is overwhelmed with drugs and alcohol ... Hes destroying the entire room and, well, we need you to send someone, please. The managers voice became more anxious as the call went on, noting the room had a balcony. Alberto Crescenti, head of the state emergency medical system, told Argentinas Todo Noticias TV channel that authorities were investigating the circumstances of his death and conducting an autopsy. Payne had been vocal about struggling with alcoholism, posting a video in July 2023 to his YouTube channel where he said he had been sober for six months after receiving treatment. Representatives for Payne did not immediately return emails and calls. Dozens of One Direction fans flocked from across Buenos Aires to the Casa Sur Hotel after the news broke, forming lines that spilled into the cordoned-off street outside the hotel where police stood sentinel. Forensic investigators were seen exiting the hotel, from where Paynes body was removed around three hours after the fall. Young women filming with their cellphones expressed shock and heartbreak as a makeshift memorial with rows of candles and bouquets quickly grew outside the hotel. I didnt think he was going to die so young, 21-year-old Isabella Milesi told the AP. Payne was one of five members of One Direction, which formed when they each auditioned for the British singing competition series The X Factor in 2010, two years after Paynes first attempt to get on the show. At 16 the second time around, Payne sang Michael Bublés version of Cry Me a River, appearing nervous at the start but warming up with the audiences cheers and applause. After each singer failed to make it through the competition as solo acts, Simon Cowell and his fellow judges combined Payne, Zayn Malik, Harry Styles, Niall Horan and Louis Tomlinson into what would become one of the most successful boy bands even though they lost the competition. Each member had their own persona, with Payne who hailed from Wolverhampton, a city in the West Midlands region of England being known as the responsible one. The band became known for their pop sound and romantic hits like What Makes You Beautiful, Night Changes and Story of My Life. Payne had prominent solos on songs including Stole My Heart and Change Your Ticket, co-writing several of the bands hits. They had six Top 10 hits on the Billboard charts by the time they disbanded in 2016 and a highly loyal fan base, known as Directioners, many of whom were teen girls. Ive always loved One Direction since I was little, said 18-year-old Juana Relh, another fan outside Paynes hotel. To see that he died and that there will never be another reunion of the boys is unbelievable, it kills me. With his meteoric rise to fame, Payne had said that it took some time to adjust to the public eye. I dont think you can ever deal with that, its all a bit crazy for us to see that people get in that sort of state of mind about us and what we do, he said in a 2013 interview with the AP after recounting an experience where a fan was in a state of shock upon meeting him. Payne had a 7-year-old son, Bear Grey Payne, with his former girlfriend, the musician Cheryl who was known as Cheryl Cole when she performed with Girls Aloud. She was an X Factor judge during One Directions season, although their relationship began years later. Payne was previously engaged to Maya Henry, from August 2020 to early 2022. Henry released a novel earlier this year that she said was based on their relationship. In addition to his son, he is survived by his parents, Geoff and Karen Payne, and his two older sisters, Ruth and Nicola. Source: AP --Agencies",

Wallace Construction. Details of how the accident occurred were not immediately available. The Associated Press left phone messages for Mullins and the Simpson County coroner, Terry Tutor. A call to the construction company was unanswered Wednesday evening, and it was not possible to leave a message.
