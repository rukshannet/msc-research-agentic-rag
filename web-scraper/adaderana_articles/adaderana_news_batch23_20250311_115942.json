        "date": "February 2, 2025 08:59 am",
        "content": "Sri Lankas cumulative deficit in the trade account has widened to USD 6 billion in 2024 compared to USD 4.9 billion in 2023. Releasing the external sector report for December 2024, the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) noted that although Sri Lanka recorded the second highest annual export earnings in history, the expansion in import expenditure outpaced the expansion of export earnings, leading to the higher trade deficit. Sri Lankas earnings from merchandise exports increased by 7.2 year-on-year to USD 12.8 billion in 2024. The figure marks the second highest annual export earnings in history. Meanwhile, expenditure on merchandise imports in 2024 amounted to USD 18.9 billion, reflecting a year-on-year increase of 12.1, driven by growth in all major import categories. Additionally, foreign investments in the government securities market recorded a net outflow of USD 179 million in 2024. However, a net inflow was observed in the last 3 months of 2024, and the net inflow in December 2024 was USD 18 million. The gross official reserves stood at USD 6.1 billion at end 2024 compared to USD 4.4 billion at end 2023, supported by net purchases by the central bank from the domestic foreign exchange market during 2024 at historically high levels and funds received from multilateral institutions. The GOR includes the USD 1.4 billion currency swap facility with the Peoples Bank of China, which was renewed for 3 years in December 2024.",

        "title": "Blue Ghost lunar lander documents its journey to moon with breathtaking views",
        "date": "February 2, 2025 09:45 am",
        "content": "The Blue Ghost lunar lander has captured its first images of the moon from the spacecrafts orbit around Earth, the Texas-based company Firefly Aerospace announced this week. The two images  which the company posted Monday on the social media platform X  features a view of the moon from the top deck of the 6.6-foot-tall (2-meter-tall) lunar lander as well as a snapshot of the celestial orb on its own. As the spacecraft continues its journey to the moon, with an expected landing date of March 2, Firefly plans to provide regular mission updates, the company said. The private US spacecraft has also been capturing images and videos of our planet, including footage of Earth eclipsing the sun, that shows the spacecraft submerged in brief darkness as the Earth blocks nearly all of the suns light. On Friday, Firefly released footage that Blue Ghost took of Earth eclipsing the moon as the spacecraft traveled in orbit. Fireflys first Moon and Blue Marble images captured by our Blue Ghost lunar lander embodies everything this bold, unstoppable team has worked so hard for over the last three years. And were just getting started, said Will Coogan, Fireflys Blue Ghost chief engineer, in an email. Blue Ghost has been orbiting Earth since January 15, when the lander hitched a ride on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket. The lunar spacecraft is expected to leave Earths orbit in about one week, embarking on a four-day journey to the moon. Blue Ghost will orbit our celestial neighbor for 16 days before attempting a descent to the lunar surface. Blue Ghost is a third of its way to the Moon, and we expect to capture even more breathtaking imagery, Coogan said. Most importantly, well be capturing critical science data for our NASA customers all along the way that will pave the way for a lasting lunar presence and unlock exploration further into our solar system. The lander carries 10 NASA science and technology instruments aboard as part of the space agencys Commercial Lunar Payload Services, or CLPS, initiative, that will collect and send back data on the moon. CLPS is part of NASAs broader Artemis program, which aims to land astronauts on the moon for the first time in more than 50 years. So far, all NASA technology aboard is healthy and operating as expected, the NASA Artemis blog announced on Monday. Firefly CEO Jason Kim previously told CNN that he is excited about sharing images and footage that Blue Ghost captures. Theres a phenomenon called the lunar horizon glow (scattered light caused by floating electrostatic particles) that only the Apollo 15 and 17 astronauts have seen with their eyes, Kim said. Were going to be able to capture that in 4K-by-4K high-definition video and share that with the rest of the world. The company plans to capture HD imagery of a total lunar eclipse from the moon when Earth will move directly between our neighbor and the sun as it travels along its orbital path. On Earth, those in the path of totality will see the moon passing completely into Earths shadow, causing the moon to take on a reddish hue. It will be visible between March 13-14 for Western Europe, parts of Asia, parts of Australia, western Africa, North and South America, and Antarctica. If all goes well, Blue Ghost will land on the far eastern edge of the moons near side by Mons Latreille, an ancient volcanic feature in a more than 300-mile-wide (483-kilometer) basin called Mare Crisium, or Sea of Crises. The lander will then perform surface operations for one lunar day (about 14 Earth days) before it faces lunar nighttime, where the period of darkness and cold temperatures are expected to cause the spacecraft to cease operations.

        "title": "Sri Lanka sees decline in birth rates and rise in infant mortality: Experts call for action",
        "date": "February 2, 2025 10:44 am",
        "content": "Nearly 313,000 women become pregnant in Sri Lanka every year, but alarmingstatistics reveal that a significant number of these pregnancies do not result in healthy births. According to the College of Community Physicians of Sri Lanka, nearly 26,000 women lose their fetuses within the first few months of pregnancy, while around 1,700 babies die in the womb after 28 weeks. At a media briefing held at the Sri Lanka Medical Association Auditorium in Colombo, the associations president, Specialist Dr. Kapila Jayaratne, emphasized the need to address the rising rates of pregnancy complications, premature births, and infant deaths. Infant Mortality Out of approximately 280,000 live births each year, nearly 20,000 babies are born with low birth weight, many requiring intensive medical care. Tragically, around 2,500 children do not survive their first year of life due to various health complications, according to Dr. Jayaratne Dr. Jayaratne detailed the leading causes of current infant deaths in Sri Lanka: Birth defects (46) Prematurity (26) Birth asphyxia (12) Newborn infections (6) Moreover, when considering child deaths under the age of five, the number rises to approximately 3,300 annually. Declining Birth Rates and Rising Deaths Sri Lanka has witnessed a notable decline in birth rates, dropping from 319,000 in 2019 to 247,000 in 2023, marking a 22-23 decrease. At the same time, the overall death toll across all age groups has surged, from 132,000 in 2020 to 181,000 in 2023. Despite these challenges, the country has made strides in healthcare, increasing life expectancy from 53-56 years in the 1950s to 73 years for men and 80 years for women today, the doctor added. Community Health Specialists Push for Preventive Measures Dr. Jayaratne stressed the importance of preventive healthcare over reactive treatment. He outlined a three-tiered approach: -Primary prevention: Stopping diseases before they develop -Secondary prevention: Managing illnesses to prevent complications -Tertiary prevention: Minimizing damage and disability once a disease develops He urged society to play an active role in improving maternal and child health, emphasizing that healthcare quality, education, economic status, and social conditions all influence pregnancy outcomes. Debate on Fatal Birth Defects and Termination Laws Dr. Jayaratne also addressed that Sri Lankas legal stance on pregnancy termination in cases of fatal birth defects. He argued that while other countries allow termination in such cases, Sri Lankan law does not, causing suffering for mothers, existing children, and the healthcare system. He urged policymakers to take action, noting that this issue has been under discussion for two decades without progress. Rising Child Suicides and the Role of Social Media A concerning trend has emerged regarding child suicides, with 133 cases recorded in 2022 and an unofficial estimate of 270 cases in 2023, he added, noting that experts partially attribute this to the negative impact of social media, calling for regulations to protect children from online harm. Dr. Jayaratne stated that investigations are underway to assess the risks and benefits of social media, with recommendations soon to be presented to lawmakers.",

        "content": "Sri Lanka national cricket teams head coach Sanath Jayasuriya says that the team suffered a huge loss against Australia due to weak batting performance. Joining a press conference held following the first Test against Australia in Galle, the former cricketer emphasized that theres no need to rationalize or make excuses for the defeat. Speaking further, Jayasuriya said: This wicket is not that difficult. These guys need to know how to handle the pressure. They need to know how to bat when they are confident. Test cricket is a unique game. There are situations in this. You have to control those situations. You have to improve by batting. We have a strong batting line-up. So we have to accept that we did not perform well. So the batsmen need to know how to convert this into big centuries. If it was a difficult wicket, I would have come and said in this discussion that this is a difficult wicket, the bowlers are bowling well, but this wicket is not that dangerous. I hope to see a strong comeback during the next Test, Jayasuriya added. Responding to a question, he also confirmed that discussions will take place with the selectors regarding potential changes to the team for the second Test.",

Speaking at a public rally held in Kurunegala, Premadasa said that the government has also failed to provide the fertilizer subsidy on time. They said that the certified price for paddy purchase will be made a legislation in the country. The ministers of the current government who promised a certified price of Rs. 150 for paddy, have now failed even to distribute the fertilizer subsidy of Rs. 25,000. This is the harvesting season, but the government hasnt even declared a proper certified price for paddy, Premadasa added. The government says that they have allocated Rs. 5 billion for the purchase of paddy, but they havent requested the Paddy Marketing Board to obtain that fund and to purchase paddy from the farmers. On the other hand, a number of red-labelled containers have been released from the port. Who instructed to do this? The government says theres no problem, and there are no illegal materials in these containers. We should ask the government how they say that without even inspecting these containers, the Opposition Leader expressed.",

        "content": "Dr. Samitha Siritunga, a specialist in the Non-Communicable Diseases Unit of the Ministry of Health, warns that inadequate vehicle maintenance is a major factor behind the increasing number of road accidents in Sri Lanka. He highlighted that due to the ongoing economic challenges, many vehicle owners are unable to carry out necessary maintenance on time, leading to safety risks on the roads. Vehicle problems can not only cause accidents but also increase their severity, Dr. Siritunga explained. With financial constraints, some people delay essential services such as replacing worn-out tires or fixing faulty brakes. Poor tire quality can lead to slipping or even bursting when driving, while malfunctioning brakes can make it harder to control the vehicle, he added. Dr. Siritunga emphasized that adhering to traffic rules and ensuring vehicles are properly maintained can significantly reduce road accidents and urged the drivers to prioritize safety by addressing maintenance issues promptly.",

Musics night of nights will take place at the Crypto.com Arena, with the ceremony kicking off at midday AEDT. In its 67th year, the 2025 Grammys belong to Beyonce, who leads the pack with 11 nominations, bringing her total nod tally to a record-breaking 99. First, though, it was all about the fashion. Bianca Censori, marking her first major Hollywood event appearance, rocked a completely sheer mini slip dress, clearly designed for the sole purpose of making it seem as though she was naked. In a debut for the ages, surely unprecedented, the Australian fashion architect posed confidently alongside husband Kanye West, her modesty entirely visible for the frenzied press pack. Things began conservatively, with the 30-year-old showing up to the venue in a black fur coat, which she dramatically ditched upon hitting the carpet. Shifting gears so aggressively our system briefly stalled, Billie Eilish flashed only her lower face in an edgy fit alongside brother Finneas. Taylor Swift is deep in her foxy era, stepping out in a daring red mini dress. Source: News.com --Agencies",

        "date": "February 3, 2025 10:13 am",
        "content": "Kendrick Lamar has won record of the year for his diss track Not Like Us at the 2025 Grammys. Were gonna dedicate this one to the city, Lamar said before shouting out Los Angeles area neighborhoods. It is the second hip-hop single to ever win in the category. The first was Childish Gambinos This Is America. The Weeknd has mended his fractious relationship with the Grammy Awards with a surprise performance of his new single, Cry For Me and Timeless with Playboi Carti. His decision is a direct reflection of the changes the Recording Academy has made to diversify its voting body, CEO Harvey Mason jr. said in his introduction. The Weeknd has been openly critical of the Grammys organization, dating back to 2020 when he wrote on Twitter: The Grammys remain corrupt. It was just one of many pleasant surprises Sunday night. Chappell Roan was named best new artist at the 2025 Grammys. She read a speech from a notebook, beginning by addressing her fellow nominees. BRAT was the best night of my life this year, she said, as her hat fell off her head, referencing Charli xcx. Then her speech changed course. She directed her attention to major labels and the music industry, instructing them to offer a living wage and healthcare, especially to developing artists. Then she described getting signed as a minor, getting dropped and entering the workforce during COVID-19 with no work experience and no health care. She asked them to treat artists like valuable employees. Labels, we got you, but do you got us? she concluded her speech. Thank you. The Grammys are airing live on CBS and Paramount. Paramount with Showtime subscribers can also watch live and on demand. Beyoncé and Chappell Roan give Grammys a country theme In one of the biggest moments of the evening so far, Taylor Swift presented the award for best country album at the 2025 Grammys to Beyoncé for her groundbreaking Cowboy Carter. I really was not expecting this. Wow, she started her speech. Genre is a cold word to keep us in our place as artists ... Im still in shock. Thank you so much for this honor. Beyoncé entered the night as the leading nominee. A little bit of the wild west, a little bit of West Hollywood. Chappell Roan brought a rocking version of her Pink Pony Club to the 2025 Grammy stage. Joined by a posse of dancing clown cowboys, she sang from atop a giant pink horse. Los Angeles on the mind The show opened with several references to the Los Angeles-area wildfires that have devastated the city but put the spotlight on the citys resiliency. Host Trevor Noahs opening speech was dedicated to those affected by the fires, promising a show that not only celebrates them, but one that also celebrates the city that brought us so much of that music. The Grammys have also allotted ad time to be used by local businesses affected by the fires. As the show neared its end, Noah announced that viewers had contributed 7 million to relief efforts Sunday night so far. On a stage set up to look like the mountains of Los Angeles, the LA born-and-raised Billie Eilish and her brothercollaborator Finneas performed her hit Birds of a Feather. It was one of a number of ways the show seeks to salute the city. We love you LA, she told the crowd at the end of the set. The show kicked off with a powerful opening performance of Randy Newmans I Love L.A. by Dawes  whose members were directly affected by the Eaton fire  backed by John Legend, Brad Paisley, Sheryl Crow, Brittany Howard and St. Vincent. Star studded performances and victories The first televised award went to Doechii for best rap album for Alligator Bites Never Heal. The tears were immediate. This category was introduced in 1989. Two women have won, Lauryn Hill  she said, correcting herself. Three women have won. Lauryn Hill, Cardi B and Doechii. Will Smith introduced a tribute to the late, great, legendary producer Quincy Jones. In his 91 years, Q touched countless lives, but I have to say he changed mine forever, he said. You probably wouldnt even know who Will Smith was without Quincy Jones. Jones died in November at age 91. Kicked off by Cynthia Erivo, accompanied by Herbie Hancock on piano, the Wicked star sang Frank Sinatras Fly Me to the Moon. Then came Lainey Wilson and Jacob Collier with Let the Good Times Roll, followed by Stevie Wonder and Hancock busting out Bluesette and We Are The World. For the later, they were joined by student singers from two schools that were lost in the LA-area fires. Then, Janelle Monae with an inspired rendition of Dont Stop Til You Get Enough, channeling Michael Jackson in a sparkly tuxedo and an effortless moonwalk. The Beatles Now and Then, which used AI technology, took home best rock performance. Sean Lennon accepted the award on behalf of his father John Lennon. As far as Im concerned, its the best band of all time, he said of the Beatles. Play the Beatles music for your kids. I feel like the world cant afford to forget. Early on, Sabrina Carpenter launched into a medley of her biggest singles of the last year  a jazzy rendition of Espresso into Please, Please, Please, with a brief Espresso reprise. Most of the best new artist nominees took part in a medley performance: Khruangbin with May Ninth, Benson Boone with Beautiful Things, Doechii launching Catfish into Denial Is a River, Teddy Swims doing Lose Control, Shaboozey with Good News into A Bar Song (Tipsy) and RAYE with Oscar Winning Tears. Shakira won Latin pop album for Las Mujeres Ya No Lloran and gave a powerful, short speech. I want to dedicate this award to all my immigrant brothers and sisters in this country, she said. The Red Hot Chili Peppers Anthony Kiedis and Chad Smith led the crowd in a short singalong of their hit Under the Bridge, reminding the crowd to support their friends and neighbors as they rebuild their lives, said Kiedis. Then they presented the best pop vocal album award to Carpenter for Short n Sweet. I really wasnt expecting this, she said. This is, woo, my first Grammy so Im going to cry. (Shes now won two, but the earlier award was handed out a pre-telecast ceremony that many artists dont attend.) Lady Gaga and Bruno Mars teamed up for a cover of California Dreamin. Later, SZA presented them with the award for best pop duogroup performance for Die With A Smile. Trans people are not invisible. ... The queer community deserves to be lifted up, Gaga said in her speech. First time winners were abundant During Sundays Premiere Ceremony, a pre-telecast show hosted by songwriter Justin Tranter, some of the biggest names in pop like Carpenter and Charli xcx won their first Grammys, as did Música Mexicana star Carin León, French metal band Gojira and country folk artist Sierra Ferrell. Soon afterward, Charli xcx also won her first two Grammys, in the best pop dance recording category for Von Dutch and best danceelectronic album for BRAT. Amy Allen won the songwriter of the year, non-classical, a Grammy category that has only existed for three years. She is the first woman to ever win. Tobias Jesso Jr. won in 2023 and Theron Thomas won in 2024. The child in me ... is screaming and crying and laughing at the absurdity of this moment, Allen started her speech. We are the engine that fuels the entire music industry, she said of songwriters past and present. Ferrell won her first Grammys for Americana performance, Americana roots song, Americana album, and American roots performance. She pulled an acceptance speech out of scepter. Honestly this is kind of hilarious, she joked after returning to the stage for a third time. Yikes! she started her fourth acceptance speech. Veterans also took home trophies, as did former President Jimmy Carter. He won a posthumous Grammy Award for narrating Last Sundays in Plains: A Centennial Celebration, recordings from his final Sunday School lessons delivered at Maranatha Baptist Church in Georgia. It was his fourth Grammy win. Source: AP --Agencies",

        "title": "10 Indian fishermen arrested by Sri Lanka Navy",
        "date": "February 3, 2025 11:04 am",
        "content": "Ten fishermen from Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, were arrested by the Sri Lankan Navy in the early hours of Monday for allegedly crossing the International Maritime Boundary Line (IMBL). Tamil Nadu coastal police officials confirmed that the fishermen were detained, and their mechanised boat was seized by Sri Lankan authorities. The arrested fishermen, along with their boat, were taken to Jaffna, Sri Lanka. They will be produced before a local court and remanded to judicial custody. This incident follows a series of similar arrests in recent weeks. On Sunday, January 26, the Sri Lankan Navy arrested 34 fishermen from Rameswaram and Thangachimadam and seized three fishing boats. The detained fishermen were presented before the Killinochchi Court, which remanded them in custody until February 5. In another incident on Tuesday, January 28, as many as 13 more fishermen from Rameswaram were arrested, and their mechanised boat was also seized. Fishermens associations have strongly condemned these repeated arrests, calling them a serious threat to their livelihood. In response to the ongoing detentions, Tamil Nadu fishermen staged a large-scale protest in Rameswaram on Friday, January 31. Fishermen and their families participated in significant numbers, demanding immediate intervention from the Centre. Antony John, a fishermens association leader from Rameswaram, expressed deep concern over the escalating arrests. The Sri Lankan Navy is arresting our fishermen regularly. On Tuesday (January 28), they even fired at our men, injuring two of them. This has to stop, he said. John further lamented that fishing in the Palk Bay is no longer safe, as fishermen are not only losing their livelihoods but also their boats and fishing equipment to Sri Lankan authorities. Fishermens leaders have urged the Indian government to take swift diplomatic action. Their primary demands include immediate release of detained fishermen from Sri Lankan prisons. Fishermen association leaders have also demanded the retrieval of impounded fishing boats and a bilateral agreement with Sri Lanka to permanently resolve the ongoing issue. Fishermens associations across Tamil Nadu have also written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, requesting urgent intervention to prevent mid-sea arrests and protect coastal communities livelihoods. Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M.K. Stalin had earlier written to External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar on January 12, 2025, urging diplomatic intervention to secure the release of detained fishermen. In his letter, CM Stalin highlighted the economic distress caused by repeated arrests and boat seizures. The recurring arrests and boat seizures have severely impacted the livelihoods of our fishermen. Swift diplomatic intervention is essential to safeguard their rights, he stated. In response, S. Jaishankar reportedly raised the issue with Sri Lankan President Anura Dissanayake during his visit to India. However, despite these diplomatic discussions, the arrests have continued, fueling frustration among the fishing community. Since June 16, 2024, the Sri Lankan Navy has detained 425 Tamil Nadu fishermen and seized 58 fishing boats. The frequent arrests have sparked widespread protests, with fishermen accusing both the Union and State governments of failing to provide a lasting solution. Rajagopal C.M., a fishermens leader from Thangachimadam, criticised the governments inaction, stating that many detained fishermen remain in Sri Lankan prisons, leaving their families in severe financial distress. Fishermens leaders also pointed out that since 2018, around 270 trawlers have been impounded, significantly affecting their ability to sustain their livelihood. Former Union Minister and Pattali Makkal Katchi (PMK) President Anbumani Ramadoss has urged the Indian government to take strong measures against Sri Lankas actions. He emphasised the need to resolve maritime boundary disputes to ensure Tamil Nadu fishermen can pursue their traditional livelihood without fear or uncertainty. With protests planned across coastal districts, fishermens associations continue to demand an immediate and lasting resolution through diplomatic efforts. Source: IANS --Agencies",

        "date": "February 3, 2025 11:18 am",
        "content": "Asian shares slid on Monday morning after US President Donald Trump followed through on his promise to impose tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China. Investors are bracing for a potential trade war that could hit the earnings of major companies and dent global growth. Canada and Mexico have said that they will hit back with retaliatory tariffs while China promised corresponding countermeasures and vowed to challenge Trumps move at the World Trade Organization. Trump has said the tariffs are necessary to halt the flow of illegal drugs and immigration into the US. Hong Kongs Hang Seng Index was down 0.7, Japans Nikkei 225 was 2.8 lower, South Koreas Kospi tumbled 3 and Australias ASX 200 fell 1.9. Markets in mainland China remained closed for the Lunar New Year holiday. Meanwhile, the US dollar was showing strength, rising to a record high against Chinas yuan, while the Canadian dollar plunged to its lowest level since 2003. The prospect of having a long and protracted trade spat between the worlds two biggest economies is causing investors to take risk off the table today, said Tim Waterer, chief market analyst at financial services firm KCM Trade. The other worry for investors is which countries may be on Trumps tariff hit list next. The tariffs announced by the Trump administration over the weekend target the United States three largest trading partners and the US president has threatened he might not stop there. Trump has also vowed to impose tariffs on the European Union pretty soon. Chief investment strategist at investment bank Saxo, Charu Chanana, warned that while tariffs could be beneficial for the US economy in the short term, in the long run they pose significant risks. Repeated use of tariffs would incentivise other countries to reduce reliance on the US, weakening the dollars global role, she added. Trump has said he will speak to Canada and Mexicos leaders on Monday about the tariffs which are due to come into effect at midnight on Tuesday. The two countries are facing tariffs of 25 on their exports to the US, while Chinese goods will face an additional 10 tax. Source: BBC --Agencies",

        "date": "February 3, 2025 11:43 am",
        "content": "President of the Coconut Milk Manufacturers Association, Randeewa Malalasooriya says that the nations coconut industry has the potential to bring in USD 2.5 billion as revenue up from the current industry average of USD 850 million. Speaking to Ada Derana, Malalasooriya further stated that the country must improve the annual coconut production to 4.5 billion nuts in the long term while also focusing on the import of low value coconut products to produce value added coconut products for re-export purposes. He also said that Sri Lanka must decrease the wastage of fresh coconut by adopting processed coconut food. Malalasooriya, who stated that 50 of coconut industry revenue in Sri Lanka comes from kernel products, noted that Sri Lanka is the 4th largest coconut manufacturer in the world. It the industry has a huge potential to earn at least USD 2.5 billion or above, if we can get the right practices in place. If you look at world market, Sri Lanka still have a good opportunity in coconut sector. As the industrialists, we strongly believe that we can in short-term take the revenue up to USD 1.5 billion and 2.5 billion in the long run. This industry has a huge potential. Furthermore, he noted: But to go there, we need minimum of 4.5 billion nuts. One of the short term strategies is to bring some of the raw materials from other countries like Indonesia or Philippines. That way, you can bring fresh nuts or low value added products, add value and then export. Malalasooriya expressed that Sri Lanka still has too lower yield per tree, emphasizing the need to increase this efficiency. On the other hand, we still consume so much coconut in a fresh format. So we need to look at processed products to stop this wastage, he added.",

        "content": "A petition has been filed with the Court of Appeal seeking an order to invalidate the parliamentary seat of Minister of Public Security and Parliamentary Affairs Ananda Wijepala. The petition was filed by the Administrative Secretary of Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP), Renuka Perera naming Minister Ananda Wijepala, the Secretary General of Parliament and the Attorney General as respondents. In his petition, the petitioner has mentioned that Wijepala was appointed as the Minister of Public Security by the President on November 18. The petitioner also claims that following a request made under the Sri Lankan Right to Information Act, it was confirmed that Ananda Wijepala had been appointed as the Presidents Chief of Staff as well. The petitioner points out that, according to Article 91 of the Constitution, a person engaged in public service is not eligible to sit in Parliament or vote in Parliament and argues that the position of the Chief of Staff to the President is a state position, and that accordingly, Minister Wijepala is not qualified to hold a seat in Parliament while holding that position. Accordingly, the petitioner has requested the court to rule that Wijepala is not qualified to hold a seat in Parliament in accordance with the Constitution and to annul his parliamentary seat. Additionally, the petitioner requests that an interim injunction be issued preventing Ananda Wijepala from sitting as a Member of Parliament, from acting as Minister of Public Security and from voting in the Parliament until the petition is heard and a final decision is made.",

        "date": "February 3, 2025 03:04 pm",
        "content": "Beyoncé won album of the year for Cowboy Carter at Sundays Grammys, delivering her  at last  the shows elusive top award. The superstar, who is both the most awarded and nominated artist in Grammys history, has been up for the category four times before and many feel she has been snubbed by its top honors. In winning album of the year with Cowboy Carter, Beyoncé has become the first Black woman to win the top prize in the 21st century. The last was Lauryn Hill with The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill 26 years ago. Before her was Natalie Cole and Whitney Houston. That means Beyoncé is only the fourth Black woman to win album of the year at the Grammys. Members of the Los Angeles Fire Department presented Beyoncé with the trophy, one of several times the show reflected the recent wildfires that burned thousands of homes. Its been many, many years, Beyoncé said in her speech. I want to dedicate this to Ms. Martell, she said, referencing Linda Martell, the performer who became the first Black woman to play the Grand Ole Opry. We finally saw it happen, everyone, host Trevor Noah said, nodding to the long overdue achievement for one of musics transcendent artists. Kendrick Lamar won song and record of the year for his diss track Not Like Us, taking home two of the nights most prestigious awards. Were gonna dedicate this one to the city, Lamar said before shouting out Los Angeles area neighborhoods. It is the second hip-hop single to ever win in the category. The first was Childish Gambinos This Is America. The Weeknd mends fences, Chappell Roan challenges music industry The Weeknd has mended his fractious relationship with the Grammy Awards with a surprise performance of his new single, Cry For Me and Timeless with Playboi Carti. His decision is a direct reflection of the changes the Recording Academy has made to diversify its voting body, CEO Harvey Mason jr. said in his introduction. The Weeknd has been openly critical of the Grammys organization, dating back to 2020 when he wrote on Twitter: The Grammys remain corrupt. It was just one of many pleasant surprises Sunday night. Chappell Roan was named best new artist. She read a speech from a notebook, speaking directly to major labels and the music industry, instructing them to offer a living wage and healthcare, especially to developing artists. She described getting signed as a minor, getting dropped and entering the workforce during COVID-19 with no work experience and no health care. She asked them to treat artists like valuable employees. Labels, we got you, she concluded her speech. But do you got us? Beyoncé and Chappell Roan give Grammys a country theme In one of the biggest moments of the evening so far, Taylor Swift presented the award for best country album to Beyoncé. She became the first Black woman to ever win in the category. Genre is a cold word to keep us in our place as artists, she said in her speech. Im still in shock. Thank you so much for this honor. Beyoncé entered the night as the leading nominee. A little bit of the wild west, a little bit of West Hollywood. Roan brought a rocking version of her Pink Pony Club to the Grammy stage. Joined by a posse of dancing clown cowboys, she sang from atop a giant pink horse. Los Angeles on the mind In incorporating the wildfires throughout the show, the Grammys put the spotlight on the citys resiliency. Noahs opening speech was dedicated to those affected by the fires, promising a show that not only celebrates them, but one that also celebrates the city that brought us so much of that music. The Grammys have also allotted ad time to be used by local businesses affected by the fires. As the show neared its end, Noah announced that viewers had contributed 7 million to relief efforts Sunday night so far. On a stage set up to look like the mountains of Los Angeles, the LA born-and-raised Billie Eilish and her brothercollaborator Finneas performed her hit Birds of a Feather. It was one of a number of ways the show seeks to salute the city. We love you LA, she told the crowd at the end of the set. The show kicked off with a powerful opening performance of Randy Newmans I Love L.A. by Dawes  whose members were directly affected by the Eaton fire  backed by John Legend, Brad Paisley, Sheryl Crow, Brittany Howard and St. Vincent. Star studded performances and victories The first televised award went to Doechii for best rap album for Alligator Bites Never Heal. The tears were immediate. This category was introduced in 1989. Two women have won, Lauryn Hill  she said, correcting herself. Three women have won. Lauryn Hill, Cardi B and Doechii. Will Smith introduced a tribute to the late, great, legendary producer Quincy Jones. In his 91 years, Q touched countless lives, but I have to say he changed mine forever, he said. You probably wouldnt even know who Will Smith was without Quincy Jones. Jones died in November at age 91. Kicked off by Cynthia Erivo, accompanied by Herbie Hancock on piano, the Wicked star sang Frank Sinatras Fly Me to the Moon. Then came Lainey Wilson and Jacob Collier with Let the Good Times Roll, followed by Stevie Wonder and Hancock busting out Bluesette and We Are The World. For the latter, they were joined by student singers from two schools that were lost in the LA-area fires. Then, Janelle Monae with an inspired rendition of Dont Stop Til You Get Enough, channeling Michael Jackson in a sparkly tuxedo and an effortless moonwalk. The Beatles Now and Then, which used AI technology, took home best rock performance. Sean Lennon accepted the award on behalf of his father John Lennon. As far as Im concerned, its the best band of all time, he said of the Beatles. First time winners were abundant. They included Carpenter, Roan, Doechii, Charli xcx, songwriter Amy Allen, Música Mexicana star Carin León, French metal band Gojira and country folk artist Sierra Ferrell. The Red Hot Chili Peppers Anthony Kiedis and Chad Smith led the crowd in a short singalong of their hit Under the Bridge, reminding the crowd to support their friends and neighbors as they rebuild their lives, said Kiedis. Then they presented the best pop vocal album award to Carpenter for Short n Sweet. I really wasnt expecting this, she said. This is, woo, my first Grammy so Im going to cry. (Shes now won two, but the earlier award was handed out a pre-telecast ceremony that many artists dont attend.) She also performed. Winners use speeches to lift marginalized communities in tense political climate Shakira won Latin pop album for Las Mujeres Ya No Lloran and gave a powerful, short speech. I want to dedicate this award to all my immigrant brothers and sisters in this country, she said. Lady Gaga and Bruno Mars teamed up for a cover of California Dreamin. Later, SZA presented them with the award for best pop duogroup performance for Die With A Smile. Trans people are not invisible. ... The queer community deserves to be lifted up, Gaga said in her speech. Alicia Keys was awarded the Dr. Dre Global Impact Award DEI is not a threat, its a gift, she said in her speech, referencing diversity, equity and inclusion programs that have been scrapped recently by the U.S. government and several major corporations.

        "content": "The Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment (SLBFE) and the Romanian Embassy have jointly organized an awareness program at the Bureaus headquarters, to address significant delays in issuing visas for Sri Lankans seeking employment in Romania. Accordingly, the event was held on last Tuesday (January 28), supported by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Foreign Employment, and Tourism, aimed to resolve the issues causing these delays. Representatives from 164 registered employment agencies, responsible for sending Sri Lankan workers to Romania, participated in the program. Currently, 235 employment agencies in Sri Lanka are actively involved in facilitating employment in Romania. Issuing a statement, the SLBFE said that Sri Lankans have been offered job opportunities in various sectors in Romania, but concerns have arisen over prolonged delays in the visa application process. The SLBFE was alerted to these delays by employment agencies, leading to communication with the Romanian Embassy through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The Embassy cited two primary causes for the delays: incomplete documentation and failures during visa interviews. In response, a discussion was held to address these concerns. The outcome of the discussions led to the organization of this awareness program, which focused on submitting complete visa applications and providing proper responses in English during visa interviews. The statement further added that the SLBFE is optimistic that these efforts will help reduce visa delays in the future. Additionally, the Bureau has announced plans to conduct special workshops for visa applicants to improve their English proficiency and interview readiness. Key figures attending the event included SLBFE General Manager D.D.P. Senanayake, Additional General Managers Anura Liyanwala, P.P. Weerasekara, and Senarath Yapa, alongside Romanian Embassy representatives: Charge dAffaires Mrs. Mihaela-Angela Rutjens and Consul Ms. Andrada-Raluca Filip.

        "date": "February 3, 2025 07:10 pm",
        "content": "A car bomb exploded on the outskirts of a northern Syrian city on Monday, killing at least 19 people, all but one of them women, and leaving more than a dozen wounded, hospital workers said. The car detonated next to a vehicle carrying mostly female agricultural workers on the outskirts of the city of Manbij. The dead included 18 women and one man, a nurse at the hospital, Mohammad Ahmad, told The Associated Press. Another 15 women were wounded, some of them in critical condition, according to the local Syrian civil defense. No group immediately claimed responsibility for the explosion. It was the seventh car bomb explosion in Manbij in just over a month, said Munir Mustafa, the deputy director of civil defense. Manbij in northeastern Aleppo province continues to witness violence even after the downfall of President Bashar Assad in December. Turkish-backed factions, known as the Syrian National Army, have clashed with the U.S.-backed Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces. The factions took the city from the SDF in early December during the lightning insurgency that toppled Assad. Not long after accusations against the SDF surfaced on Syrian social media accounts, the SDF in a statement condemned the attack and accused Ankara-backed groups of possibly being involved in order to cause more internal strife in the country. The statement said they will communicate with Syrias new interim government in Damascus to investigate the circumstances surrounding the attack. A resident said the car that detonated was parked on the roadside. The recurring attacks have forced residents to become more vigilant, he said. There are efforts from the people of Manbij to focus on protecting some neighborhoods as well as setting up surveillance cameras in the main neighborhoods of the city, Jameel al-Sayyed, a Manbij activist and journalist said. Mustafa warned that the attacks in Aleppo province near Syrias second city are a threat to Syrias progress to bring about post-war security and economic recovery. Most of the explosions took place at night. The continued attacks on Syrian civilian areas and targeting civilians while they are trying to recover from the effects of the war of the defunct Assad regime ... threaten their lives, deepens their humanitarian tragedy, undermines educational and agricultural activities and livelihoods, and worsens the humanitarian situation in Syria, Mustafa said. A car bombing in Manbij on Saturday killed four civilians and wounded nine, state news agency SANA reported, citing civil defense officials. Source: AP --Agencies",

Issuing his Independence Day message, the President said: Despite countless obstacles and the deep-rooted flaws of the past corrupt political system, the peoples government, built by the collective will of the citizens, is steadily progressing forward. As promised, we have successfully ushered Sri Lanka into an era of national revival. Now, the task ahead is to systematically build upon this foundation and realise a centuries-old dream with unwavering confidence and creativity, he added. Presidents Full Message: Today, as we celebrate the 77th National Independence Day, we do so with hopes and aspirations for a new kind of freedom. Reflecting on Sri Lankas history, we have now embarked on a new path, with a government built through the collective efforts of the people from the North, East, West, and South. At this moment, we stand together to take on the challenge of rebuilding a thriving nation  a beautiful life; something that was lost and eluded us over the past century. For the sake of our future generations, we must elevate our nation to new heights. This was the very expectation of all the heroes in our history who struggled to achieve it with their blood and tears. Therefore, both individually and collectively, we must build a modern, developed Sri Lankan nation, guided by social, environmental, and ethical principles. As the new government, over the past four months, we have laid the foundation for a stable economy, introduced a new political culture, and committed ourselves to a new political ideal. We strive for a society where people regard each other with equality, respect, and empathy; free from racism and religious divisions. We focus on governance through public engagement and the rule of law, while prioritising the eradication of rural poverty. Our policies and actions aim to ensure that no citizen, particularly the most vulnerable, is left behind. Steps have also been taken towards digitalising the economy to embrace advancements in science and technology that we previously missed. Additionally, we are committed to transforming Sri Lankas global imagefrom a country known for corrupt governance to one that upholds an independent foreign policy and earns trust in international relations. Despite countless obstacles and the deep-rooted flaws of the past corrupt political system, the peoples government, built by the collective will of the citizens, is steadily progressing forward. As promised, we have successfully ushered Sri Lanka into an era of national revival. Now, the task ahead is to systematically build upon this foundation and realise a centuries-old dream with unwavering confidence and creativity. On this 77th National Independence Day, I invite all Sri Lankans to stand strong and united, to take part in shaping a modern vision of freedom, and to contribute to the collective beginning of this new era of revival. Meanwhile, issuing the Independence Day message, Prime Minister Dr. Harini Amarasuriya states that the independence is not just about sovereignty; it is about dignity, justice, and the right to a life free from oppression.",

Citing a report by the coconut research institute, the chairman claimed that the island is in short supply of 200 million nuts from January to April this year, driven by a drop in coconut harvests this off-season. Furthermore, Ranatunga highlighted that the current coconut price hike was prompted by a drop in the coconut harvest during the off season. The Coconut Research Institute projects a deficit of 200 million nuts from January to April, he said, noting that the short supply of 200 million nuts has led to excess demand in the market. To control the surge in Coconut prices a cabinet paper will be presented to approve the import of coconut milk, coconut flour, and frozen coconut kernel, which are crucial raw materials required by several local industries, the Coconut Development Authority Chairman added. Moreover, he stated, through these imports we believe we can eliminate unnecessary demand from the industrial sector and thus prevent an necessary price hike in the local market.",

        "date": "February 4, 2025 10:48 am",
        "content": "U.S. President Donald Trump suspended his threat of steep tariffs on Mexico and Canada on Monday, agreeing to a 30-day pause in return for concessions on border and crime enforcement with the two neighboring countries. U.S. tariffs on China are still due to take effect within hours. Both Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said they had agreed to bolster border enforcement efforts in response to Trumps demand to crack down on immigration and drug smuggling. That would pause 25 tariffs due to take effect on Tuesday for 30 days. Canada agreed to deploy new technology and personnel along its border with the United States and launch cooperative efforts to fight organized crime, fentanyl smuggling and money laundering. Mexico agreed to reinforce its northern border with 10,000 National Guard members to stem the flow of illegal migration and drugs. The United States also made a commitment to prevent trafficking of high-powered weapons to Mexico, Sheinbaum said. As President, it is my responsibility to ensure the safety of ALL Americans, and I am doing just that. I am very pleased with this initial outcome, Trump said on social media. The agreements forestall, for now, the onset of a trade war that economists predicted would damage the economies of all involved and usher in higher prices for consumers. After speaking by phone with both leaders, Trump said he would try to negotiate economic agreements over the coming month with the two largest U.S. trading partners, whose economies have become tightly intertwined with the United States since a landmark free-trade deal was struck in the 1990s. China Tariffs still Planned No such deal has emerged for China, which faces across-the-board tariffs of 10 that are poised to begin at 12:01 a.m. ET on Tuesday (0501 GMT). A White House spokesperson said Trump would not be speaking with Chinese President Xi Jinping until later in the week. Trump warned he might increase tariffs on Beijing further. China hopefully is going to stop sending us fentanyl, and if theyre not, the tariffs are going to go substantially higher, he said. China has called fentanyl Americas problem and said it would challenge the tariffs at the World Trade Organization and take other countermeasures, but also left the door open for talks. The latest twist in the saga sent the Canadian dollar soaring after slumping to its lowest in more than two decades. The news also gave U.S. stock index futures a lift after a day of losses on Wall Street. Industry groups, fearful of disrupted supply chains, welcomed the pause. Thats very encouraging news, said Chris Davison, who heads a trade group of Canadian canola producers. We have a highly integrated industry that benefits both countries. Trump suggested on Sunday the 27-nation European Union would be his next target, but did not say when. EU leaders at an informal summit in Brussels on Monday said Europe would be prepared to fight back if the U.S. imposes tariffs, but also called for reason and negotiation. The U.S. is the EUs largest trade and investment partner. Trump hinted that Britain, which left the EU in 2020, might be spared tariffs. Trump acknowledged over the weekend that his tariffs could cause some short-term pain for U.S. consumers, but says they are needed to curb immigration and narcotics trafficking and spur domestic industries. The tariffs as originally planned would cover almost half of all U.S. imports and would require the United States to more than double its own manufacturing output to cover the gap - an unfeasible task in the near term, ING analysts wrote. Other analysts said the tariffs could throw Canada and Mexico into recession and trigger stagflation - high inflation, stagnant growth and elevated unemployment - at home.

        "date": "February 4, 2025 11:19 am",
        "content": "China on Tuesday slapped tariffs on U.S. imports in a swift response to new U.S. duties on Chinese goods, renewing a trade war between the worlds top two economies as President Donald Trump sought to punish China for not halting the flow of illicit drugs. Trumps additional 10 tariff across all Chinese imports into the U.S. came into effect at 12:01 a.m. ET on Tuesday (0501 GMT). Within minutes, Chinas Finance Ministry said it would impose levies of 15 for U.S. coal and LNG and 10 for crude oil, farm equipment and some autos. The new tariffs on U.S. exports will start on Feb. 10, the ministry said. China also said it was starting an anti-monopoly investigation in Alphabet Incs Google, while including both PVH Corp, the holding company for brands including Calvin Klein, and U.S. biotechnology company Illumina on its unreliable entities list. Separately, Chinas Commerce Ministry and its Customs Administration said it is imposing export controls on tungsten, tellurium, ruthenium, molybdenum and ruthenium-related items to safeguard national security interests. China controls much of the worlds supply of such rare earths that are critical for the clean energy transition. Trump on Monday suspended his threat of 25 tariffs on Mexico and Canada at the last minute, agreeing to a 30-day pause in return for concessions on border and crime enforcement with the two neighbouring countries. But there was no such reprieve for China, and a White House spokesperson said Trump would not be speaking with Chinese President Xi Jinping until later in the week. During his first term in 2018, Trump initiated a brutal two-year trade war with China over its massive U.S. trade surplus, with tit-for-tat tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars worth of goods upending global supply chains and damaging the world economy. To end that trade war, China agreed in 2020 to spend an extra 200 billion a year on U.S. goods but the plan was derailed by the COVID pandemic and its annual trade deficit had widened to 361 billion, according to Chinese customs data released last month. The trade war is in the early stages so the likelihood of further tariffs is high, Oxford Economics said in a note as it downgraded its China economic growth forecast. Trump warned he might increase tariffs on China further unless Beijing stemmed the flow of fentanyl, a deadly opioid, into the United States. China hopefully is going to stop sending us fentanyl, and if theyre not, the tariffs are going to go substantially higher, he said on Monday. China has called fentanyl Americas problem and said it would challenge the tariffs at the World Trade Organization and take other countermeasures, but also left the door open for talks. Stocks in Hong Kong pared gains after Chinas retaliation. Unlike Canada and Mexico, it is clearly harder for the U.S. and China to agree on what Trump demands economically and politically. The previous market optimism on a quick deal still looks uncertain, said Gary Ng, senior economist at Natixis in Hong Kong. Even if the two countries can agree on some issues, it is possible to see tariffs being used as a recurrent tool, which can be a key source of market volatility this year. Neighbourly Deals There was relief in Ottawa and Mexico City, as well as global financial markets, after the deals to avert the hefty tariffs on Canada and Mexico. Both Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said they had agreed to bolster border enforcement efforts in response to Trumps demand to crack down on immigration and drug smuggling. That would pause 25 tariffs due to take effect on Tuesday for 30 days. Canada agreed to deploy new technology and personnel along its border with the United States and launch cooperative efforts to fight organized crime, fentanyl smuggling and money laundering.

This order was issued by Anuradhapura Chief Magistrate Nalaka Sanjeewa Jayasuriya, after the accused was produced before the court today (04). The suspect was arrested and produced before the court on allegations of causing a financial loss exceeding Rs. 11.5 million to the government by deliberately tampering with sealed examination papers and forwarding them to a tuition class teacher in Thambuthgama area via WhatsApp. According to the Anuradhapura Divisional Crimes Unit, preliminary investigations have revealed that the suspect broke the seals of the exam paper parcels at his school, used a teachers mobile phone to take photographs, and sent them to the tuition teacher in question. Additionally, the suspect allegedly took another exam paper home, photographed it using his daughters mobile phone, and shared the images via WhatsApp. He reportedly resealed the parcels meticulously after extracting the papers, police told the court.

        "title": "China announces measures against Google, other US firms, as trade tensions escalate",
        "date": "February 4, 2025 03:03 pm",
        "content": "China on Tuesday announced a wide range of measures targeting U.S. businesses including Google, farm equipment makers and fashion brand Calvin Kleins owner, minutes after additional U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods took effect. The measures were announced as Beijing also slapped tariffs on some U.S. products such as coal, gas and electric trucks in a rapid response to the new duties on Chinese goods imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump, escalating trade tensions between the worlds two biggest economies. Chinas Commerce Ministry said it had put PVH Corp, the holding company for brands including Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger, and U.S. biotechnology firm Illumina on its unreliable entity list. It said the two companies took what it called discriminatory measures against Chinese enterprises and damaged the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese companies. Companies added to the blacklist can be subject to fines and a broad range of other sanctions, including a freeze on trade and revocation of work permits for foreign staff. Separately, Chinas State Administration of Market Regulation said Google was suspected of violating the countrys anti-monopoly law and an investigation was initiated into the company in accordance with the law. It did provide further details on the investigation or on what it alleged Google had done to breach the law. Google products such as its search engine are blocked in China and its revenue from there is about 1 of global sales. In 2017, Google announced the launch of a small artificial intelligence center in China. But the project was disbanded two years later and the firm does not conduct AI research in China, according to a blog posting. Google still works with Chinese partners such as advertisers. Google, PVH and Illumina did not immediately respond to requests for comment outside regular U.S. business hours. PVH had already been under scrutiny from Chinese regulators over improper conduct related to the Xinjiang region. Tesla and Farm Equipment Firms Chinas Finance Ministry also announced 10 tariffs on farm equipment that could impact U.S. firms such as Caterpillar , Deere  Co and AGCO , as well as a small number of trucks and big-engine sedans shipped to China from the United States. That could apply to Elon Musks Cybertruck, a niche offering Tesla has been promoting in China, as it awaits regulatory clearance to begin sales. Chinas Ministry of Industry and Information technology designated the Cybertruck as a passenger car in a posting in December that was quickly deleted. If the Cybertruck was designated as an electric truck, Tesla would face a 10 tariff on any future imports from its factory in Texas. Tesla had no immediate comment. The new tariffs on U.S. products will start on Feb. 10, the ministry said. The announcements made on Tuesday ramped up trade restrictions between Beijing and Washington that had been largely limited to the tech sector under the administration of former U.S. President Joe Biden, which sought to restrict Chinas access to high-end semiconductors. China said in December it had launched an investigation into Nvidia over a suspected violation of the countrys anti-monopoly law, a probe widely seen as a retaliatory shot against Washingtons latest curbs on the Chinese chip sector. Intels products sold in China were also called for a security review late last year by an influential Chinese industry group. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "content": "A woman has filed civil lawsuits against Neil Gaiman and his ex-wife in the US, accusing the British author of sexually assaulting her. The lawsuits against Gaiman and Amanda Palmer were filed in Wisconsin, Massachusetts and New York. The woman alleges the former couple violated laws on federal human trafficking, with complaints of assault, battery and inflicting emotional distress against Gaiman and negligence against Palmer. She is seeking at least 7m (5.6m) in damages. Gaiman, 64, has denied allegations of sexual misconduct made by eight women, saying he has never engaged in non-consensual sexual activity with anyone. Ever. The lawsuits claim the woman was befriended by Palmer when she was 22 and homeless in New Zealand and began working for the couple, which is when the assaults began. According to the lawsuits, Palmer told the woman there had been previous complaints from more than a dozen different women. Five women, four of whom were among eight featured in a New York Magazine article in January, made allegations about the writer in a Tortoise Media podcast series published in summer 2024. Gaiman, whose books Good Omens, American Gods and The Sandman have been adapted for television - has denied all of the allegations made against him, posting on his blog, on 14 January: Ive stayed quiet until now, both out of respect for the people who were sharing their stories and out of a desire not to draw even more attention to a lot of misinformation. As I read through this latest collection of accounts, there are moments I half-recognise and moments I dont, descriptions of things that happened sitting beside things that emphatically did not happen. He acknowledged that he was careless with peoples hearts and feelings and could have done so much better, but said he does not accept there was any abuse. Since the allegations emerged, publisher Dark Horse Comics cancelled upcoming work by Gaiman and a UK stage adaptation of his book Coraline has been pulled. Source: BBC --Agencies",

        "title": "Trump and Netanyahu meet as internal pressure to end truce mounts for Israel",
        "date": "February 4, 2025 10:02 pm",
        "content": "President Donald Trump and Benjamin Netanyahu are set to meet Tuesday as the Israeli prime minister faces competing pressure from his right-wing coalition to end a temporary truce against Hamas militants in Gaza and from war-weary Israelis who want the remaining hostages home and the 15-month conflict to end. Trump is guarded about the long-term prospects for the truce, even as he takes credit for pressuring Hamas and Israel into the hostage and ceasefire agreement that went into effect the day before he returned to office last month. I have no guarantees that the peace is going to hold, Trump told reporters on Monday. The leaders talks are expected to touch on a long-sought Israel-Saudi Arabia normalization deal and concerns about Irans nuclear program, but hammering out the second phase of the hostage deal will be at the top of the agenda. Netanyahus arrival in Washington for the first foreign leader visit of Trumps second term comes as the prime ministers popular support is lagging. Netanyahu is in the middle of weekslong testimony in an ongoing corruption trial that centers on allegations he exchanged favors with media moguls and wealthy associates. He has decried the accusations and said he is the victim of a witch hunt. Being seen with Trump, who is popular in Israel, could help distract the public from the trial and boost Netanyahus standing. Its Netanyahus first travel outside Israel since the International Criminal Court issued arrest warrants in November for him, his former defense minister and Hamas slain military chief, accusing them of crimes against humanity during the war in Gaza. The U.S. does not recognize the ICCs authority over its citizens or territory. Netanyahu and Trumps Mideast envoy Steve Witkoff on Monday began the daunting work of brokering the next phase of a ceasefire agreement. Netanyahu said in a statement that the meeting with Witkoff and U.S. national security adviser Michael Waltz was positive and friendly. The Israeli leader said he would send a delegation to Qatar to continue indirect talks with Hamas that are being mediated by the Gulf Arab country, the first confirmation that those negotiations would continue. Netanyahu also said he would convene his security Cabinet to discuss Israels demands for the next phase of the ceasefire when he returns to Israel at the end of the week. Netanyahu is under intense pressure from hard-right members of his governing coalition to abandon the ceasefire and resume fighting in Gaza to eliminate Hamas. Bezalel Smotrich, one of Netanyahus key partners, vows to topple the government if the war isnt relaunched, a step that could lead to early elections. Hamas, which has reasserted control over Gaza since the ceasefire began last month, has said it will not release hostages in the second phase without an end to the war and Israeli forces full withdrawal. Netanyahu, meanwhile, maintains that Israel is committed to victory over Hamas and the return of all hostages captured in the Oct. 7, 2023 attack that triggered the war. Mira Resnick, a former deputy assistant secretary of state for Israeli and Palestinian affairs, said Trump may have little patience for political woes of Netanyahu if it gets in the way of the broader goals of this administration. The president started his term by saying that he wanted the ceasefire to be in place by Jan. 20. Thats what he got, Resnick said. He is invested in this because he was able to take credit for it. Einav Zangauker, whose son Matan is among the hostages, called on Trump to use American leverage to keep Netanyahu committed to the agreement. Matan, 24, is among those who are expected to be included in the second phase of the deal, when all remaining living hostages  including men under the age of 50 and male soldiers  are to be exchanged for a yet-to-be-determined number of Palestinian prisoners. The second phase is also expected to include the full withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza. I want President Trump to know there are certain extreme elements from within Israel who are trying to torpedo his vision, said Zangauker, who traveled to Washington from Israel to join a planned Tuesday rally outside the White House. We are representative of the vast, vast majority of Israel. The ultra-extremists are blackmailing the prime minister to do their bidding. Since returning to office, Trump has called for relocating Palestinians from Gaza to neighboring Egypt and Jordan, even as Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi and Jordanian King Abdullah II have rejected it. Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, the Palestinian Authority and the Arab League have joined Egypt and Jordan in rejecting plans to move Palestinians out of their territories in Gaza and the occupied West Bank. Yet Trump insists he can persuade Egypt and Jordan to come around to accept displaced Palestinians because of the significant aid that the U.S. provides Cairo and Amman. Hard-line right-wing members of Netanyahus government have embraced the call to move displaced Palestinians out of Gaza. Shibley Telhami, the Anwar Sadat Professor for Peace and Development at the University of Maryland, said the push by Trump to move Palestinians out of Gaza is helpful to Netanyahu. But he added that it undercuts Trump and Netanyahus desire to land a normalization deal with Saudi Arabia. The Saudis, the biggest Arab power in the Middle East, have said they would only agree to such a deal if the war ends and there is a credible pathway to a Palestinian state in Gaza and the West Bank. This push by Trump doesnt square with the idea of a Palestinian state as we know it, Telhami said. Its hard to see the Saudis going along with it. Netanyahu on Monday met with Trumps pick to serve as ambassador to Israel, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, and evangelical leaders. Huckabee has long rejected a Palestinian state in territory previously seized by Israel. The prime minister is also expected to press Trump to take decisive action on Iran. Tehran has faced a series of military setbacks, including Israeli forces significantly degrading Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah militants in Lebanon as well as an operation that decimated Irans air defenses. The moment, Netanyahu believes, has created a window to decisively address Tehrans nuclear program. This is one of the most important and critical meetings between an American president and an Israeli prime minister, said Eytan Gilboa, an expert on U.S.-Israel relations at Bar-Ilan University near the Israeli city of Tel Aviv. Whats at stake here is not just bilateral relations between Israel and the United States but the reshaping of the Middle East. Source: AP --Agencies",

        "title": "Trump says he wants US to take ownership of Gaza Strip",
        "date": "February 5, 2025 06:50 am",
        "content": "President Donald Trump vowed on Tuesday that the U.S. would take over the war-ravaged Gaza Strip after Palestinians are resettled elsewhere and develop it economically, a move that would shatter decades of U.S. policy toward the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Trump unveiled his surprise plan, without providing specifics, at a joint press conference with visiting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The announcement followed Trumps shock proposal earlier on Tuesday for the permanent resettlement of Palestinians from Gaza to neighboring countries, calling the enclave - where the first phase of a fragile ceasefire is in effect - a demolition site. The U.S. will take over the Gaza Strip, and we will do a job with it too, Trump told reporters. Well own it and be responsible for dismantling all of the dangerous unexploded bombs and other weapons on the site. If its necessary, well do that, were going to take over that piece, were going to develop it, create thousands and thousands of jobs, and itll be something that the entire Middle East can be very proud of, Trump added. Asked who would live there, Trump said it could become a home to the worlds people. Netanyahu said Trump was thinking outside the box with fresh ideas and was showing willingness to puncture conventional thinking. QUESTIONS ABOUT U.S. AUTHORITY But Trump did not directly respond to a question of how and under what authority the U.S. can take over the land of Gaza and occupy it in the long term. I do see a long-term ownership position and I see it bringing great stability to that part of the Middle East, he said, adding that he had spoken to regional leaders and they supported the idea. Ive studied this very closely over a lot of months, Trump added, saying he would visit Gaza but without saying when. Trump earlier repeated his call for Jordan, Egypt and other Arab states to take in Gazans, saying Palestinians there had no alternative but to abandon the coastal strip, which must be rebuilt after nearly 16 months of a devastating war between Israel and Hamas militants. But this time Trump said he would support resettling Palestinians permanently, going beyond his previous suggestions that Arab leaders had already steadfastly rejected. Forced displacement of Gazas population would likely be a violation of international law and would be fiercely opposed not only in the region but also by Washingtons Western allies. Some human rights advocates liken the idea to ethnic cleansing. Senior Hamas official Sami Abu Zuhri condemned Trumps calls for Gazans to leave as expulsion from their land. We consider them a recipe for generating chaos and tension in the region because the people of Gaza will not allow such plans to pass, he said. Trump offered no specifics on how a resettlement process could be implemented but his proposal echoed the wishes of Israels far right and contradicted former President Joe Bidens commitment against mass displacement of Palestinians. DEMOLITION SITE Just two weeks into his second term, Trump was hosting Netanyahu at the White House to discuss the future of the Gaza ceasefire, strategies to counter Iran and hopes for a renewed push for an Israeli-Saudi normalization deal. Its a pure demolition site, Trump, speaking shortly before Netanyahu arrived, said of Gaza earlier. If we could find the right piece of land, or numerous pieces of land, and build them some really nice places with plenty of money in the area, thats for sure. I think that would be a lot better than going back to Gaza. I dont know how they (Palestinians) could want to stay, Trump said when asked about the reaction of Palestinian and Arab leaders to his proposal. With Netanyahu at his side in the Oval Office, Trump later made similar remarks but suggested that Palestinians should leave Gaza for good in nice homes and where they can be happy and not be shot, not be killed. They are not going to want to go back to Gaza, he said. Reasserting his proposal at a joint press conference after their talks, Trump described the Gaza Strip as a longtime symbol of death and destruction and said Palestinians there should be housed in various domains in other countries. He said the U.S. will take over the Gaza Strip, level the site and create economic development but did not say how. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "title": "Swedens deadliest attack leaves 11 dead at Orebro adult school",
        "date": "February 5, 2025 06:58 am",
        "content": "Eleven people were killed in a shooting at an adult education centre on Tuesday, Swedish police said, marking the countrys deadliest gun attack in what the prime minister called a painful day. Police said the gunman was believed to be among those killed and a search for other possible victims was continuing at the school, located in the city of Orebro. The gunmans motive was not immediately known. We know that 10 or so people have been killed here today. The reason that we cant be more exact currently is that the extent of the incident is so large, local police chief Roberto Eid Forest told a news conference. Later in the evening the police website said: At this time, there are 11 deaths due to the incident. The number of injured is still unclear. We currently have no information on the condition of those who have been injured. Forest told the press conference police believed the gunman had acted alone and that terrorism was not currently suspected as a motive, though he cautioned that much remained unknown. He said the suspected gunman had not previously been known to police. We have a big crime scene, we have to complete the searches we are conducting in the school. There are a number of investigative steps we are taking: a profile of the perpetrator, witness interviews, Forest said. The shooting took place in Orebro, some 200 km (125 miles) west of Stockholm, at the Risbergska school for adults who did not complete their formal education or failed to get the grades to continue to higher education. It is located on a campus that also houses schools for children. Ali Elmokad was outside the Orebro University Hospital, looking for his relative, not yet knowing if he was among the injured or the dead. Weve been trying to get hold of him all day, we havent been successful, he said, adding that he had a friend who also attended the school. What she saw was so terrible. She only saw people lying on the floor, injured and blood everywhere. Police said it was still going through the crime scene and had searched several addresses in Orebro after the attack. Late on Tuesday, police vans and personnel were still outside an apartment building in central Orebro that had been raided earlier. We saw a lot of police with drawn weapons, said Lingam Tuohmaki, 42, who lives in the same building. We were at home and heard a commotion outside. Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson said it was the worst mass shooting in Swedish history. It is hard to take in the full extent of what has happened today -- the darkness that now lowers itself across Sweden tonight, he told a news conference. King Carl XVI Gustav conveyed his condolences. It is with deep sadness and dismay that my family and I received the news about the terrible atrocity in Orebro, he said. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen expressed her sympathy on X, saying: In this dark hour, we stand with the people of Sweden. WE STARTED RUNNING Maria Pegado, 54, a teacher at the school, said someone threw open the door to her classroom just after lunch break and shouted to everyone to get out. I took all my 15 students out into the hallway and we started running, she told Reuters by phone. Then I heard two shots but we made it out. We were close to the school entrance. I saw people dragging injured out, first one, then another. I realised it was very serious, she said. Many students in Swedens adult school system are immigrants seeking to improve basic education and gain degrees to help them find jobs in the Nordic country while also learning Swedish. Sweden has been struggling with a wave of shootings and bombings caused by an endemic gang crime problem that has seen the country of 10 million people record by far the highest per capita rate of gun violence in the EU in recent years. However, fatal attacks at schools are rare. Ten people were killed in seven incidents of deadly violence at schools between 2010 and 2022, according to the Swedish National Council for Crime Prevention. Sweden has a high level of gun ownership by European standards, mainly linked to hunting, though it is much lower than in the United States, while the gang crime wave has highlighted the high incidence of illegal weapons. In one of the highest-profile crimes of the past decade, a 21-year-old masked assailant driven by racist motives killed a teaching assistant and a boy and wounded two others in 2015. In 2017, a man driving a truck mowed down shoppers on a busy street in central Stockholm before crashing into a department store. Five people died in that attack. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "date": "February 5, 2025 10:05 am",
        "content": "Sri Lanka Customs has discovered a stock of narcotics concealed within a suspicious parcel sent through a freight company in Colombo during routine screening procedures. According to Sri Lanka Customs Media Spokesperson and Additional Director General Seevali Arukgoda, the discovery was made based on intelligence received by officers of the Narcotics Control Unit. The parcel, which had been dispatched from the United Kingdom to an address in Kiribathgoda, was opened in the presence of the suspect. Upon inspection, officers have uncovered 65 grams of Kush cannabis and 500 milliliters of suspected liquid cocaine, carefully concealed within the package. This marks the first recorded instance of liquid cocaine being detected by the Sri Lanka Customs. The seized narcotics are estimated to have a street value of approximately Rs. 13 million, according to Sri Lanka Customs. The suspect, a 23-year-old resident of Ragama who is employed in the tourism sector, is currently in custody as further investigations continue. Meanwhile, in a separate operation, a foreign national was arrested for attempting to smuggle 1.40 kilograms of Kush cannabis out of Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) in Katunayake. The suspect was apprehended by officers of the Police Narcotics Bureau, who stated that the estimated street value of the seized cannabis is approximately Rs. 12.5 million. The narcotics had been meticulously concealed within toffee and chocolate packets, which were hidden inside the suspects luggage in an attempt to evade detection. The arrested individual, a 45-year-old Indian national, is a businessman operating a mobile phone shop in Chennai, India. He had arrived at BIA from New Delhi, India, on an Indian Airlines flight at approximately 5.10 p.m. yesterday (04). Police further revealed that the suspect has a brother residing in Colombo and that he had previously traveled to Sri Lanka multiple times under the pretext of visiting him. The Indian national is scheduled to be presented before the Negombo Magistrates Court today (05), along with the seized narcotics. The Police Narcotics Bureau has launched further investigations into the incident.",

        "title": "China plans to send flying robot to search for water on the moons far side",
        "date": "February 5, 2025 10:06 am",
        "content": "China plans to send a flying robot to the far side of the moon next year to search for the frozen water that could hold the key to future lunar exploration, as the country pushes forward with its ambitious space program. The robotic flying detector will be deployed to the lunar south pole as part of Chinas Change-7 mission, which aims to bring the country closer to landing astronauts on the moon within five years, state media reported on Monday. China has mounted a significant effort to establish itself as a major player in space  a domain that nations, including the United States, are increasingly looking to not only for scientific benefit, but also with an eye to resources and national security. Finding water on the moon would be nothing new, however. Last year, Chinese scientists found water in soil samples from the Change-5 lunar probe, while NASA and Indian spacecraft have previously spotted what they believe to be water on the moons surface. But some scientists believe only ice  thought to be preserved deep in craters on the moons far side  could potentially support future lunar missions as a water source for astronauts. And the search for lunar ice is part of Chinas preparations to build a research base at the moons south pole, Chinese space experts told state broadcaster CCTV. There are some very deep caves at the south pole of the moon, and we think there may be water there, Wu Weiren, chief designer of Chinas Lunar Exploration Project, told CCTV. We hope the flying detector can conduct on-site inspections into one or two caves after landing. Finding ice deposits could potentially help sustain human life on the moon one day, the Chinese experts said, adding it would significantly reduce the cost of space missions  and suggest the possibility of extraterrestrial life. Other experts have previously told CNN that though discoveries of lunar water open doors for future exploration, we cant yet use those findings to plant crops on the moon or extract drinkable water; these depend on many factors such as how abundant the water is, and the chemical form they take. Flying robot The China National Space Administration has in recent years carried out a series of increasingly complex robotic lunar missions, including the first-ever return of lunar samples from the far side of the moon last year. It has been angling to become the second country to land astronauts on the moon, saying its first crewed mission will take place by 2030. Under that plan, the Change-7 mission scheduled for 2026 aims to carry out the most detailed survey of the lunar south pole, using an orbiter, a lander, a rover  and the flying detector. The flying robot can bend its legs and land in a similar way to humans jumping from a height, the Chinese experts told state media, though the reports did not specify how many legs it has. The device is expected to carry out at least three leaps from sunlit areas to shadowed craters to conduct detailed analyses and potentially determine the location, quantity and distribution of ice, the experts added. Studies have shown that lunar ice is in the darkest and coldest areas at the poles, in shadows of craters where sunlight never reaches due to the tilt of the moons axis. The warmest temperatures in these areas dont go above negative-250 degrees Fahrenheit. Tang Yuhua, deputy chief designer of the Change-7 mission, said those harsh conditions would severely test the flying robot. To work for a long time under these circumstances is a big challenge, he told state media. Source: CNN --Agencies",

        "title": "Trump administration puts on leave USAID staff globally in dramatic aid overhaul",
        "date": "February 5, 2025 10:32 am",
        "content": "The Trump administration on Tuesday announced that it was going to put on leave all directly hired employees of the U.S. Agency for International Development globally and recall thousands of personnel working overseas. On Friday, February 7, 2025, at 11:59 pm (EST) all USAID direct hire personnel will be placed on administrative leave globally, said an announcement on the USAID web site, which has been down since the weekend. Some personnel responsible for mission-critical functions, core leadership and specially designated programs were excepted from the move, it said. USAIDs workforce totals more than 10,000, with about two-thirds of that staff serving overseas, according to the Congressional Research Service (CRS). The agency has more than 60 country and regional missions. For USAID staff overseas, Washington was preparing a plan in coordination with the State Department and would pay for the return travel of personnel to the United States within 30 days, the announcement said. It added that the USAID leadership was going to consider case-by-case exceptions based on personal hardship or concerns over mobility and safety. Thank you for your service, the announcement finished. The shocking overhaul, which risks upending the lives of thousands of staff and their families, comes as President Donald Trump moves merge USAID, Washingtons primary humanitarian agency that distributes billions of dollars worth of aid abroad, with the State Department and effectively dismantle the agency as an independent entity. On Monday, Secretary of State Marco Rubio told reporters he was now the acting head of USAID, calling the agency completely unresponsive and accusing staff there of being unwilling to answer simple questions about programs. He informed Congress in a letter of the looming reorganization of the agency, saying some parts of USAID might be absorbed by the State Department and the remainder may be abolished. But because Congress established USAID as an independent establishment within the executive branch, the President does not have the authority to abolish it without congressional authorization, according to a CRS report this week. Hundreds of USAID programs covering lifesaving aid across the globe came to a halt after Trump on Jan. 20 ordered a freeze of most U.S. foreign aid, saying he wanted to ensure it is aligned with his America First policy. He tasked billionaire Elon Musk, who has falsely accused USAID of being a criminal organization, with scaling down the agency. The announcement on the USAID website went online hours after State Department officials were told by Peter Marocco, a Trump appointee who was on Monday tasked with overseeing the agencys operations, that all USAID staff and their families should be recalled, sources said. Tuesday nights announcement caps nearly two weeks of mayhem at the agency, where dozens of staff at the headquarters in DC were put on leave and hundreds of internal contractors were laid off. Implementing partners of USAID are facing financial trouble on the back of stop-work orders from the State Department. Waivers have been issued for some emergency life-saving assistance. In fiscal year 2023, the United States disbursed 72 billion of aid worldwide on everything from womens health in conflict zones to access to clean water, HIVAIDS treatments, energy security and anti-corruption work. It provided 42 of all humanitarian aid tracked by the United Nations in 2024. The funding, less than 1 of the United States total budget, is instrumental in Washingtons effort to build alliances around the world, reinforce its diplomacy and counter the influence of adversaries such as China and Russia in the developing world. The announcement added that essential personnel expected to continue working will be informed by Agency leadership by Thursday, February 6, at 3:00pm (EST). Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "content": "Googles updated, public AI ethics policy removes its promise that it wont use the technology to pursue applications for weapons and surveillance. In a previous version of the principles seen by CNN on the internet archive Wayback Machine, the company included applications it wont pursue. One such category was weapons or other technology intended to injure people. Another was technology used to surveil beyond international norms. That language is gone on the updated principles page. Since OpenAI launched chatbot ChatGPT in 2022, the artificial intelligence race has advanced at a dizzying pace. While AI has boomed in use, legislation and regulations on transparency and ethics in AI have yet to catch up  and now Google seems to have loosened self-imposed restrictions. In a blog post Tuesday, senior vice president of research, labs, technology  society James Manyika and Google DeepMind head Demis Hassabis said that AI frameworks published by democratic countries have deepened Googles understanding of AIs potential and risks. Theres a global competition taking place for AI leadership within an increasingly complex geopolitical landscape. We believe democracies should lead in AI development, guided by core values like freedom, equality, and respect for human rights, the blog post said. The post continued, and we believe that companies, governments, and organizations sharing these values should work together to create AI that protects people, promotes global growth, and supports national security. Google first published its AI Principles in 2018, years before the technology became almost ubiquitous. Googles update is a sharp reversal in values from those original published principles. In 2018, Google dropped a 10 billion bid for a cloud computing Pentagon contract, saying at the time we couldnt be assured that it would align with our AI Principles. More than 4,000 employees had signed a petition that year demanding a clear policy stating that neither Google nor its contractors will ever build warfare technology, and about a dozen employees resigned in protest.

        "content": "The Attorney Generals Department has informed the Supreme Court that the incumbent government has decided to introduce several new amendments to the Online Safety Act, which was passed under the previous administration. Appearing on behalf of the Attorney General, Solicitor General Viraj Dayaratne informed this to the court today (05) when four fundamental rights petitions challenging the legality of the Act were taken up. The petitioners argue that the manner in which the Act was passed was unlawful. The petitions have been filed by multiple parties, including Transparency International Sri Lanka. The petitions were taken up today before a Supreme Court bench comprising Justices S. Thurairaja, Shiran Gunaratne, Achala Wengappuli and Mahinda Samayawardena. During the hearing, Solicitor General Dayaratne informed the court that a Cabinet paper is scheduled to be presented in the near future regarding the proposed amendments. He also stated that although steps had been taken to introduce amendments during the previous government, these efforts were stalled following the dissolution of Parliament. Attorney-at-Law Senany Dayaratne and Presidents Counsel Viran Corea, representing the petitioners, argued that their petitions challenge the legality of the manner in which the bill in question was passed. However, the Supreme Court bench advised the petitioners legal counsel that since the government is working on introducing amendments, it would be appropriate to proceed with the petitions after reviewing the progress of these amendments. Accordingly, the Supreme Court ordered that the hearing of the petitions be postponed until June 23. The petitioners claim that after the Online Safety Act was tabled in Parliament, multiple parties challenged certain clauses, arguing that they were unconstitutional. The petitioners also state that the Supreme Court, after reviewing these concerns, suggested several amendments, which the government could have incorporated if the bill was passed by a simple majority in Parliament. However, the petitioners allege that the previous government failed to implement several key recommendations made by the Supreme Court when passing the bill. As a result, they argue that the bill was not passed in a proper and a legal manner. Accordingly, the petitioners have requested the Supreme Court to declare that their fundamental rights have been violated through the passing of this bill and that the manner in which the bill was passed was unlawful.",

        "content": "Sri Lankan cricketing legend Lasith Malinga has urged fans to rally behind former Test captain Dimuth Karunaratne as he prepares to play his final Test match tomorrow (06). In a heartfelt video shared on his official Facebook page, Malinga called on cricket fans to fill the Galle International Cricket Stadium and give Karunaratne a fitting farewell during Sri Lankas second and final Test against Australia, which starts tomorrow (06). I request everyone who loves the game to go and watch the final Test match. Everyone should fill the stadium in Galle for Dimuth. I hope you all will come to the stadium for Dimuth. He will hit a century. When Dimuth scores 100, you should stand and clap. Dima, wishing you all the best, and I hope youll be able to say goodbye amid the applause of all the spectators, Malinga said. Karunaratne, 36, made his Test debut in 2012 at Galle, scoring a duck and an unbeaten 60 against New Zealand. Since then, the left-arm opener has established himself as one of the pillars of Sri Lankan cricket, amassing 7,172 runs across 99 Test matches, including 16 centuries. His highest Test score of 244 came against Bangladesh in 2021, and he holds the record for being among the batters who have recorded a duck and a hundred in the very same Test match. Karunaratne led Sri Lanka in 30 tests from 2019 until 2024. He was nominated for the ICC Test Player of the Year Award in 2021, and was also included in the World Test XI by the ICC in 2021 for being the third-highest run-scorer in the format with 902 runs, including four blistering centuries at a mammoth average of 69.38. In addition to his Test achievements, Karunaratne has featured in 50 ODIs for the island nation. Playing 100 Tests is a tough thing to accomplish, especially when youre an opening batter and youre doing the dirty work for the team, Karunaratne told ESPNcricinfo. The left-hand batter also opened up on one of his biggest regrets in his career - never appearing in a World Test Championship Final. Id also have loved to make it to a World Test Championship final and experience that feeling of being in a final. We were close twice, but it never happened. As he prepares to step onto the field for his 100th and final Test, fans and cricketing greats alike are expected to celebrate his contributions to Sri Lankas cricketing history. Widely regarded as Sri Lankas most accomplished Test opener, Karunaratne is expected to officially announce his retirement from both Test and international cricket during a press conference in Galle today. His final appearance in Sri Lankan whites is set to be an emotional moment for fans and teammates alike.",
