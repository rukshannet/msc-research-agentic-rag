        "date": "December 23, 2024 09:46 pm",
        "content": "A high-level discussion on the critical preparations for Sri Lankas upcoming Mutual Evaluation (ME) by the AsiaPacific Group on Money Laundering (APG) was held today (23) at the Presidential Secretariat under the patronage of President Anura Kumara Disanayake. The meeting focused on preventing money laundering and countering terrorism financing (AMLCFT) and included participation from cabinet ministers, ministry secretaries, officials from the Central Bank of Sri Lanka, and the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU), the Presidents Media Division (PMD) reported. The FIU highlighted the urgent implementation of cabinet-approved action plans involving 24 key institutions, including regulatory bodies and law enforcement agencies. These plans prioritize legal reforms, capacity building, enhanced inter-agency cooperation, and maintaining comprehensive records to meet the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) recommendations effectively. President Disanayake directed the establishment of dedicated teams to ensure compliance and closely monitor progress. He emphasized the importance of collaboration and accountability in strengthening Sri Lankas AMLCFT framework, the PMD said. He underscored the need for a robust and effective system to secure favourable evaluation outcomes, maintain financial stability, and bolster international confidence in the countrys economy, it added. Deputy Minister of Finance and Planning Dr. Harshana Suriyapperuma and Secretary to the President Dr. Nandika Sanath Kumanayake also attended at the meeting. --PMD",

        "title": "Biden commutes most federal death sentences",
        "date": "December 23, 2024 09:49 pm",
        "content": "US President Joe Biden has commuted the sentences of 37 out of 40 federal death row inmates, switching their penalty to life in prison without parole. The three excluded from the measure include the Boston Marathon bomber and the man who killed Jewish worshippers in 2018. In a statement, Biden said he was more convinced than ever that we must stop the use of the death penalty at the federal level. His measure does not include more than 2,000 people convicted to death by State authorities. Bidens decision comes before the return of President-elect Donald Trump in January, who resumed federal executions when he was in office. Among those reprieved by Biden are nine people convicted of murdering fellow prisoners, four for murders committed during bank robberies and one who killed a prison guard. Make no mistake: I condemn these murderers, grieve for the victims of their despicable acts, and ache for all the families who have suffered unimaginable and irreparable loss, Biden added. Disgraced former New Orleans police officer Len Davis, who operated a drug ring involving other officers and arranged a womans murder, is among those who have been shown clemency. The three remaining on death row include Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, who helped carry out the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing, and avowed white supremacist Dylann Roof who shot and killed nine Black churchgoers in Charleston, South Carolina in 2015. Robert Bowers, who killed 11 Jewish worshippers during a mass shooting in 2018 at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh, will also remain on death row. Biden has campaigned as an opponent of the death penalty, and the Justice Department issued a moratorium on its use at federal level after he became president. During his first term in office, Trump oversaw 13 deaths by lethal injection during his final six months in power. There had been no federal inmates put to death in the US since 2003 until Trump resumed federal executions in July 2020. During his re-election campaign, Trump indicated he would expand the use of capital punishment to include human and drug traffickers, as well as migrants who kill American citizens. Biden appeared to make reference to Trumps intentions in his statement by saying he could not in good conscience - stand back and let a new administration resume executions that I halted. In US law, these clemency decisions cannot be reversed by a presidents successor. Bidens decision will not impact people sentenced to death in state courts, which is around around 2,250 inmates according to the Death Penalty Information Centre. More than 70 state executions have been carried out during Bidens presidency. The death penalty has been abolished in 23 of the 50 US states. Six other states, including Arizona, California, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania and Tennessee, have moratoriums in place. Earlier this month, Biden commuted the sentences of nearly 1,500 people and pardoned 39 more convicted of nonviolent crimes. He also pardoned his son, Hunter Biden, who was facing sentencing for two criminal cases. He had pleaded guilty to tax charges earlier in September, and was found guilty of being an illegal drug user in possession of a gun in June - becoming the first child of a sitting president to be a convicted of a crime. The US Constitution decrees that a president has the broad power to grant reprieves and pardons for offences against the United States, except in cases of impeachment. Source: BBC --Agencies",

        "content": "A rare genetic disorder, Congenital Methemoglobinemia, has been diagnosed for the first time in Sri Lanka, affecting a child from the Medawachchiya area in Anuradhapura. The condition, which causes the skin to turn blue and severely impairs breathing, was identified by a specialist at the premature infant unit of the Anuradhapura Teaching Hospital. Dr. S.U.C. Ranawaka, a specialist doctor at the neonatal care unit of Anuradhapura Teaching Hospital explained that this disorder has significantly impacted the childs growth and development. Initial tests to confirm the diagnosis were not available locally, prompting the doctor to send the childs blood sample to Germany for advanced testing. The results have confirmed the presence of Congenital Methemoglobinemia. Despite the challenges, the doctor emphasized that timely intervention saved the childs life. The Ministry of Health provided the required medication, enabling effective treatment, he noted. Congenital Methemoglobinemia is a rare condition, typically linked to consanguineous marriages, where parents are closely related by blood. However, in this case, the childs parents confirmed no such relation. Globally, the disorder affects approximately one in every 100,000 children. In people with congenital methemoglobinemia, some normal hemoglobin is replaced by methemoglobin, which cant carry oxygen to tissues. This can lead to oxygen deprivation and symptoms like cyanosis, weakness, and shortness of breath. The doctor also confirmed that this is the first time in Sri Lankas history where Congenital Methemoglobinemia was diagnosed in a patient in the country.",

        "content": "South Koreas main opposition party vowed on Tuesday to impeach acting president Han Duck-soo but reversed an earlier plan and decided to wait until later in the week, party officials said, as the risk of further political uncertainty heightened. The move comes as the country is reeling from impeached President Yoon Suk Yeols short-lived bid to impose martial law on Dec. 3 that he partly blamed on the oppositions propensity to impeach government officials. Opposition Democratic Party (DP) floor leader Park Chan-dae said the party will wait until later this week to decide whether to go ahead with the plan to impeach Han. Earlier, the party said it would introduce a bill to impeach Han on Tuesday. The DP, which has a majority in parliament, is taking the step after Han postponed signing legislation to launch a special counsel investigation into President Yoon Suk Yeols failed bid to impose martial law. It said Han was acting against the will of the people, effectively aiding Yoon, whose powers have been suspended after parliament voted to impeach him on Dec. 14. Once an impeachment bill is submitted then formally introduced at a plenary session, it must be voted on within 24 to 72 hours. If Han is impeached, the finance minister would be next in line to lead the government as acting president, according to South Korean law. Prime Minister Han took over from the suspended Yoon, who faces a Constitutional Court review on whether to oust him or restore his powers. Acting president Han made it clear at todays cabinet meeting that he would not greenlight the special prosecution law, the DPs Park said. There is no way to interpret it other than that he is delaying time. With its parliamentary majority, the DP passed bills this month to appoint a special counsel to pursue charges of insurrection, among others, against the conservative Yoon, and to investigate his wife over a luxury bag scandal and other allegations. An unnamed high-ranking official from Hans office called the DPs move to impeach Han highly regrettable, the Newsis news agency said. The international community is currently supporting the acting president system ... Impeachment could undermine that trust, and adversely affect the economy, Newsis cited the official as saying. Hans office could not immediately be reached for comment. Yoons ruling People Power Party (PPP) has accused the DP of threatening to topple the government for not complying with their demands, at a time when South Koreas key ally the United States has just restarted planned communications with the country under Hans stewardship. Yoon has yet to announce his legal team or appear publicly since a televised statement on Dec. 14, the day parliament impeached him. Seok Dong-hyeon, a lawyer advising Yoon, told reporters on Tuesday that Yoon is unlikely to appear for questioning on Wednesday, Christmas Day, in answer to a summons by authorities investigating his move to impose martial law. Yoon is prioritising the Constitutional Courts trial, Seok said. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "title": "Global hunger crisis deepens as major nations skimp on aid",
        "date": "December 24, 2024 07:11 pm",
        "content": "Its a simple but brutal equation: The number of people going hungry or otherwise struggling around the world is rising, while the amount of money the worlds wealthiest nations are contributing toward helping them is dropping. The result: The United Nations says that, at best, it will be able to raise enough money to help about 60 of the 307 million people it predicts will need humanitarian aid next year. That means at least 117 million people wont get food or other assistance in 2025. The U.N. also will end 2024 having raised about 46 of the 49.6 billion it sought for humanitarian aid across the globe, its own data shows. Its the second year in a row the world body has raised less than half of what it sought. The shortfall has forced humanitarian agencies to make agonizing decisions, such as slashing rations for the hungry and cutting the number of people eligible for aid. The consequences are being felt in places like Syria, where the World Food Program (WFP), the U.N.s main food distributor, used to feed 6 million people. Eyeing its projections for aid donations earlier this year, the WFP cut the number it hoped to help there to about 1 million people, said Rania Dagash-Kamara, the organizations assistant executive director for partnerships and resource mobilization. Dagash-Kamara visited the WFPs Syria staff in March. Their line was, We are at this point taking from the hungry to feed the starving, she said in an interview. U.N. officials see few reasons for optimism at a time of widespread conflict, political unrest and extreme weather, all factors that stoke famine. We have been forced to scale back appeals to those in most dire need, Tom Fletcher, U.N. under-secretary-general for humanitarian affairs and emergency relief coordinator, told Reuters. The funding gap Conflict, extreme weather and soaring inflation have left growing numbers of people in need of humanitarian aid. Also increasing is the gap between the funding the U.N. seeks for humanitarian relief and the amount donors actually provide. Financial pressures and shifting domestic politics are reshaping some wealthy nations decisions about where and how much to give. One of the U.N.s largest donors  Germany  already shaved 500 million in funding from 2023 to 2024 as part of general belt tightening. The countrys cabinet has recommended another 1 billion reduction in humanitarian aid for 2025. A new parliament will decide next years spending plan after the federal election in February. Humanitarian organizations also are watching to see what U.S. President-elect Donald Trump proposes after he begins his second term in January. Trump advisers have not said how he will approach humanitarian aid, but he sought to slash U.S. funding in his first term. And he has hired advisers who say there is room for cuts in foreign aid. The U.S. plays the leading role in preventing and combating starvation across the world. It provided 64.5 billion in humanitarian aid over the last five years. That was at least 38 of the total such contributions recorded by the U.N. SHARING THE WEALTH The majority of humanitarian funding comes from just three wealthy donors: the U.S., Germany and the European Commission. They provided 58 of the 170 billion recorded by the U.N. in response to crises from 2020 to 2024. Three other powers  China, Russia and India  collectively contributed less than 1 of U.N.-tracked humanitarian funding over the same period, according to a Reuters review of U.N. contributions data. The inability to close the funding gap is one of the major reasons the global system for tackling hunger and preventing famine is under enormous strain. The lack of adequate funding  coupled with the logistical hurdles of assessing need and delivering food aid in conflict zones, where many of the worst hunger crises exist  is taxing efforts to get enough aid to the starving. Almost 282 million people in 59 countries and territories were facing high levels of acute food insecurity in 2023. Reuters is documenting the global hunger-relief crisis in a series of reports, including from hard-hit Sudan, Myanmar and Afghanistan. The failure of major nations to pull their weight in funding for global initiatives has been a persistent Trump complaint. Project 2025, a set of policy proposals drawn up by Trump backers for his second term, calls on humanitarian agencies to work harder to collect more funding from other donors and says this should be a condition for additional U.S. aid. On the campaign trail, Trump tried to distance himself from the controversial Project 2025 blueprint. But after winning the election, he chose one of its key architects, Russell Vought, to run the U.S. Office of Management and Budget, a powerful body that helps decide presidential priorities and how to pay for them. For secretary of state, the top U.S. diplomat, he tapped Florida Senator Marco Rubio, who has a record of supporting foreign aid. Project 2025 makes particular note of conflict  the very factor driving most of todays worst hunger crises. Humanitarian aid is sustaining war economies, creating financial incentives for warring parties to continue fighting, discouraging governments from reforming, and propping up malign regimes, the blueprint says. It calls for deep cuts in international disaster aid by ending programs in places controlled by malign actors. Billionaire Elon Musk has been tapped by Trump to co-lead the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), a new body that will examine waste in government spending. Musk said this month on his social media platform, X, that DOGE would look at foreign aid. The aid cuts Trump sought in his first term didnt pass Congress, which controls such spending. Senator Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican and close Trump ally on many issues, will chair the Senate committee that oversees the budget. In 2019, he called insane and short-sighted a Trump proposal to cut the budget for foreign aid and diplomacy by 23. Graham, Vought, Rubio and Musk did not respond to questions for this report. OLYMPICS AND SPACESHIPS So many people have been hungry in so many places for so long that humanitarian agencies say fatigue has set in among donors. Donors receive appeal after appeal for help, yet have limits on what they can give. This has led to growing frustration with major countries they view as not doing their share to help. Jan Egeland was U.N. humanitarian chief from 2003 to 2006 and now heads the Norwegian Refugee Council, a nongovernmental relief group. Egeland said it is crazy that a tiny country like Norway is among the top funders of humanitarian aid. With a 2023 gross national income (GNI) less than 2 the size of Americas, Norway ranked seventh among governments who gave to the U.N. that year, according to a Reuters review of U.N. aid data. It provided more than 1 billion. Two of the five biggest economies  China and India  gave a tiny fraction as much. China ranked 32nd among governments in 2023, contributing 11.5 million in humanitarian aid. It has the worlds second-largest GNI. India ranked 35th that year, with 6.4 million in humanitarian aid. It has the fifth-largest GNI. Egeland noted that China and India each invested far more in the type of initiatives that draw world attention. Beijing spent billions hosting the 2022 Winter Olympics, and India spent 75 million in 2023 to land a spaceship on the moon. How come there is not more interest in helping starving children in the rest of the world? Egeland said. These are not developing countries anymore. They are having Olympics ... They are having spaceships that many of the other donors never could dream of. Liu Pengyu, spokesman for the Chinese embassy in Washington, said China has always supported the WFP. He noted that it feeds 1.4 billion people within its own borders. This in itself is a major contribution to world food security, he said. Indias ambassador to the U.N. and its Ministry of External Affairs did not respond to questions for this report. To analyze giving patterns, Reuters used data from the U.N.s Financial Tracking Service, which records humanitarian aid. The service primarily catalogs money for U.N. initiatives and relies on voluntary reporting. It doesnt list aid funneled elsewhere, including an additional 255 million that Saudi Arabia reported giving this year through its own aid organization, the King Salman Humanitarian Aid  Relief Centre. RESTRICTIONS AND DELAYS When aid does come, it is sometimes late, and with strings attached, making it hard for humanitarian organizations to respond flexibly to crises. Aid tends to arrive when the animals are dead, people are on the move, and children are malnourished, said Julia Steets, director of the Global Public Policy Institute, a think tank based in Berlin. Steets has helped conduct several U.N.-sponsored evaluations of humanitarian responses. She led one after a drought-driven hunger crisis gripped Ethiopia from 2015 to 2018. The report concluded that while famine was avoided, funding came too late to prevent a huge spike in severe acute malnutrition in children. Research shows that malnutrition can have long-term effects on children, including stunted growth and reduced cognitive abilities. Further frustrating relief efforts are conditions that powerful donors place on aid. Donors dictate details to humanitarian agencies, down to where food will go. They sometimes limit funding to specific U.N. entities or nongovernmental organizations. They often require that some money be spent on branding, such as displaying donors logos on tents, toilets and backpacks. Aid workers say such earmarking has forced them to cut rations or aid altogether. The U.S. has a long-standing practice of placing restrictions on nearly all of its contributions to the World Food Program, one of the largest providers of humanitarian food assistance. More than 99 of U.S. donations to the WFP carried restrictions in each of the last 10 years, according to WFP data reviewed by Reuters. Asked about the aid conditions, a spokesperson for the U.S. Agency for International Development, which oversees American humanitarian spending, said the agency acts in accordance with the obligations and standards required by Congress. Those standards aim to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of humanitarian aid, the spokesperson said, and aid conditions are meant to maintain an appropriate measure of oversight to ensure the responsible use of U.S. taxpayer funds. Some current and former officials with donor organizations defend their restrictions. They point to theft and corruption that have plagued the global food aid system. In Ethiopia, as Reuters has detailed, massive amounts of aid from the U.N. World Food Program were diverted , in part because of the organizations lax administrative controls. An internal WFP report on Sudan identified a range of problems in the organizations response to an extreme hunger crisis there, Reuters reported earlier this month, including an inability to react adequately and what the report described as anti-fraud challenges. The U.N. has a zero tolerance policy toward interferences that disrupt aid and is working with donors to manage risks, said Jens Laerke, spokesperson for the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. Solving the U.N.s broader fundraising challenges will require a change in its business model, said Martin Griffiths, who stepped down as U.N. humanitarian relief chief in June. Obviously, what we need to do is to have a different source of funding. In 2014, Antonio Guterres, now the U.N.s secretary-general and then head of its refugee agency, suggested a major change that would charge U.N. member states fees to fund humanitarian initiatives. The U.N.s budget and peacekeeping missions already are funded by a fee system. Such funding would offer humanitarian agencies more flexibility in responding to need. The U.N. explored Guterres idea in 2015. But donor countries preferred the current system, which lets them decide case by case where to send contributions, according to a U.N. report on the proposal. Laerke said the U.N. is working to diversify its donor base. We cant just rely on the same club of donors, generous as they are and appreciative as we are of them, Laerke said.

This decision was made following a special directive issued by the Minister of Energy, Kumara Jayakody. The CEB trade unions had launched a protest campaign last January, alleging that the board was being privatized. In response, the then Minister of Power and Energy, Kanchana Wijesekera, instructed officials to suspend employees who avoided their duties during the protest, citing disruptions caused to consumers, despite electricity supply being declared an essential service. As a result, a total of 62 employees were suspended from their positions. However, under the new government, Minister Jayakody has ordered their reinstatement, restoration of privileges, and cancellation of disciplinary transfers. The employees had met with Minister Kumara Jayakody today (24).",

        "date": "December 24, 2024 10:14 pm",
        "content": "A Russian cargo ship sank in the Mediterranean Sea between Spain and Algeria, leaving two crew members missing, Spains maritime rescue agency and the Russian Foreign Ministry said Tuesday. Fourteen of the Ursa Majors crew were rescued uninjured from a lifeboat and transferred to Spain, the agency said. The Russian ministry said the ship started sinking following an explosion in the engine room. The vessel was owned by SK-Yug, a subsidiary of the Russian shipping and logistics company Oboronlogistika, which was established under Russias defense ministry and placed under U.S. and European Union sanctions for its ties to Russias military. Spanish authorities said there were empty containers and two cranes on board. They did not confirm the cause of the accident. In a statement on Dec. 20, Oboronlogistika said the cargo ship was headed to Russias far eastern city of Vladivostok carrying two cranes for the port weighing 380 tons each. Ursa Major had left St. Petersburg 12 days ago, Russian state news agency Ria Novosti said. Spanish authorities said they received an alert around 1 p.m. Monday when the vessel was roughly 57 nautical miles (106 kilometers) from Almería in southeastern Spain. The maritime rescue agency contacted a ship nearby that reported poor weather conditions, a lifeboat in the water and the Ursa Major listing. Authorities said a Russian warship arrived later Monday to oversee rescue operations, and the 142-meter (466-foot) cargo vessel sank around midnight. The Russian embassy in Spain told RIA Novosti it was investigating the accident and was in contact with local authorities. Ursa Major was in the western Mediterranean at the same time as Sparta  another Russian cargo ship under U.S. sanctions  whose destination as reported Tuesday was Port Said in Egypt, according to ship-spotting platform MarineTraffic.com. Its not unusual for Russian ships going from St. Petersburg to Vladivostok to transit through the Mediterranean and the Suez Canal. With global warming, the Northern Sea Route via Russias Arctic is increasingly traversed year-round, but most ships still choose the southern route in winter. Spanish maritime rescue units remained in the area Tuesday to monitor for pollution and remove any floating objects that could be dangerous for navigation, authorities said. Source: AP --Agencies",

        "date": "December 25, 2024 09:10 am",
        "content": "Pulled from the mud as an infant after the devastating Indian Ocean tsunami in 2004 and reunited with his parents following an emotional court battle, the boy once known as Baby 81 is now a 20-year-old dreaming of higher education. Jayarasa Abilashs story symbolised that of the families torn apart by one of the worst natural calamities in modern history, but it also offered hope. More than 35,000 people in Sri Lanka were killed, with others missing. The 2-month-old baby was washed away by the tsunami in eastern Sri Lanka and found some distance from home by rescuers. At the hospital, he was No. 81 on the admissions registry. His father, Murugupillai Jayarasa, spent three days searching for his scattered family, with little left to his name in those early hours but a pair of shorts. First he found his mother, then his wife. But their infant son was missing. A nurse had taken the baby from the hospital, but returned him after hearing that his family was alive. The ordeal, however, was far from over. Nine other families had submitted their names to the hospital, claiming Baby 81 as their own, so the hospital administration refused to hand over the child to Jayarasa and his wife without proof. The family went to the police. The matter went to court. The judge ordered a DNA test, a process that was still in its early stages in Sri Lanka. But none of the nine other families claimed the baby legally, and no DNA testing was done on them, Jayarasa said. The hospital named the child Baby 81 and listed the names of nine people who claimed the child, omitting us, he said. There was a public call to all those who said the child was theirs to subject themselves for DNA testing, but none of them came forward, he recalled. Jayarasa said his family gave DNA samples and it was proven the child was theirs. Soon, the family was reunited. Their story drew international media attention, and they even visited the US for an interview. Today, Abilash is sitting for his final high school exam. Solid and good-natured, he hopes to attend a university to study information technology. He said he grew up hearing about his story from his parents, while classmates teased him by calling him Baby 81 or tsunami baby. He was embarrassed, and it worsened every time the anniversary of the tsunami arrived. I used to think Here they have come and run inside and hide myself, he said as journalists returned to hear his story again. His father said the boy was so upset he wouldnt eat at times. I consoled him saying, Son, you are unique in being the only one to have such a name in this world, he said. Later, as a teenager, Abilash read more about the events that tore him from his family and brought him back, and he lost his fear. He knows the nickname will follow him for life. But thats all right. Now I only take it as my code word, he said, joking. If you want to find me out, access that code word. He continues to search online to read about himself. His father said memories of those frantic, searching days 20 years ago remain fresh, even as others fade. Over the years, the extensive publicity his family received has also affected them negatively, Jayarasa said. His family was excluded from many of the tsunami relief and reconstruction programmes because government officials assumed they had received money during their visit to the US. The experience also led to jealousy, gossiping and ostracising of the family in their neighbourhood, forcing them to relocate. The father wants his son and other family members to remain grateful for their survival, and he wants Abilash to become someone who can help others in need. From time the boy was a toddler, his father collected small amounts of money from his work at a hairdressing shop. When Abilash turned 12, the family erected a small memorial to victims of the tsunami in their front yard. It shows four cupped hands. The father explained: A thought arose in my mind that since all those who have died have gone, leaving Abilash behind for us, why not a memorial site of our own to remember them every day.

        "date": "December 25, 2024 12:19 pm",
        "content": "The Alcohol and Drug Information Centre (ADIC) has issued a statement regarding the proposal by the Commissioner General of Excise to introduce alcohol at a lower price. The ADIC argues that the proposal aims to increase alcohol consumption among the population by reducing its price under the pretense of reducing illegal alcohol sales, thereby creating a favorable situation for alcohol companies. The statement references the World Health Organization (WHO), which advocates for increasing taxes on alcohol and cigarettes as an effective method for controlling consumption. The ADIC supports this stance, asserting that raising excise taxes is a scientifically confirmed strategy to reduce alcohol consumption and minimize new alcohol users. The WHO and other research institutions have long supported this approach, it said. Alcohol consumption has been identified as one of the four leading risk factors contributing to non-communicable diseases (NCDs), which are responsible for 8 out of 10 preventable deaths worldwide, the statement said. In Sri Lanka, alcohol consumption claims the lives of 50 people per day, totaling nearly 20,000 deaths annually, ADIC claims. The ADIC stresses that the role of the Commissioner General of Excise and the department should be focused on preventing harm caused by alcohol consumption. This can be achieved by properly collecting alcohol taxes and addressing the illegal alcohol trade, it said. Furthermore, the ADIC calls on the Commissioner General of Excise to identify and remove illegally sold alcohol from the market, hold fraudulent businessmen accountable, and take proactive steps to prevent such activities in the future, the statement added.",

        "date": "December 25, 2024 03:43 pm",
        "content": "Christopher Nolan is following his Oscar-winning Oppenheimer with a true epic: Homers The Odyssey. It will open in theaters on July 17, 2026, Universal Pictures said Monday. Details remain scarce, but the studio teased that it will be a mythic action epic shot across the world using brand new IMAX technology. It will also be the first time that an adaptation of Homers saga will play on IMAX film screens. Nolan has been an IMAX enthusiast for years, going back to The Dark Knight, and has made his last three films exclusively using large format film and the highest resolution film cameras. For Oppenheimer, the first black-and-white IMAX film stock was developed. Nolan hasnt said specifically what the new technology for The Odyssey will be, but earlier this month he told The Associated Press that theyre in an intensive testing phase with IMAX to prepare for the new production. They have an incredible engineering staff, really brilliant minds doing extraordinary work, Nolan said. Its wonderful to see innovation in the celluloid film arena still happening and happening at the highest level possible. The Odyssey will be Nolans second collaboration with Universal Pictures following Oppenheimer, which earned nearly 1 billion at the box office and won the filmmaker his first Oscars, including for best director and best picture. Rumors about his next project have been swirling ever since, with near-daily speculations about plot  none of which turned out to be true  and casting. While there are many reports about actors joining the ensemble, none has been officially confirmed by the studio. Source: AP --Agencies",

        "title": "AI will eavesdrop on worlds wildest places to track and help protect endangered wildlife",
        "date": "December 25, 2024 03:57 pm",
        "content": "The endangered Geoffreys spider monkeys that dangle high in the rainforest canopy are elusive and hard for scientists to track. So biologist Jenna Lawson hid 350 audio monitors in trees across Costa Ricas lush Osa Peninsula to spy on them. The devices recorded the sounds of the forest and surrounding countryside for a week, collecting so much data that Lawson could have spent years listening to it all. Instead, she fed it into artificial intelligence systems trained to instantly recognize spider monkey calls and detect where the animals traveled. One of the worlds largest acoustic wildlife studies when Lawson began the project in 2021, it revealed troubling findings about the health of a treasured wildlife refuge. More of this AI-assisted wildlife surveillance is urgently needed as some 28 of all plant and animal species are now at risk of extinction, according to a paper published in the academic journal Science this summer. Researchers from Dutch and Danish universities showed that machine-learning techniques can handle huge amounts of data and uncover sound patterns, allowing for faster, cheaper, and better ecological studies that can aid in biodiversity conservation. But many technical challenges remain. Tech giant Microsofts philanthropic AI for Good Lab announced this month it is hoping to answer some of those technical challenges with a new kind of hardware and computing system for eavesdropping on the planets wildest places. Those remote places are also the most important places on the Earth from a biodiversity perspective, said Microsofts chief data scientist, Juan Lavista Ferres, in an interview last week by video call from Colombia, where a research team was preparing to test the new approach. Powered by the sun and energy-efficient AI computer chips, the devices can run for years rather than weeks without human intervention. And they can regularly transmit their data online via low-Earth orbit satellites. Its called Sparrow, short for Solar-Powered Acoustic and Remote Recording Observation Watch. Pablo Arbelaez, director of an AI-focused research center at the University of the Andes, said a first Sparrow test will happen in a jungle preserve along Colombias largest river, the Magdalena. Eventually, the researchers hope to get a better idea of how deforestation  and efforts to reverse it  is affecting the population behavior of jaguars, blue-beaked paujil birds, spider monkeys and other endangered species. Another project closer to Microsoft headquarters will monitor forests in Washington states Cascade Mountains. By late 2025, Lavista Ferres plans to have devices on all continents, from remote corners of the Amazon rainforest to gorilla habitats of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. That will then be open-sourced to make it accessible to a wide body of researchers in real time, but with measures to obscure sensitive location data. What we dont want is these devices to ever be used for poachers to understand where the animals are, Lavista Ferres said. It was a concern about encroachments on Costa Rican spider monkey habitat that led Lawson, then at Imperial College London, to undertake her ambitious bio-acoustic study three years ago. She persuaded landowners to let her place recording devices on their properties outside Corcovado National Park, a jewel of Costa Ricas decades-long efforts to preserve biodiversity by encouraging wildlife tourism. She basically realized the spider monkey is in a really critical situation, said local environmentalist and bug scientist Jim Córdoba-Alfaro. On a follow-up visit last year, he and Lawson trekked across a private reserve with an Associated Press reporter to observe the monkeys and check on the audio monitors. Compared to the charismatic capuchin monkey and the notoriously loud howler monkey -- both commonly seen or heard throughout Costa Rica  spider monkeys are far more wary of humans and the changes they bring. Theyre the most sensitive of the primates that we have here, said Lawson. The spider monkey would be the first animal to leave when theres signs of trouble. They would be the last animal to come back once forests are restored because they need mature secondary and primary forest to be able to survive. The Royal Society of London in March 2023 published Lawsons findings of what the audio monitors revealed: the spider monkeys werent going anywhere near paved roads or the plantations harvesting palm oil and teak wood that bisect the regions protected national parks. That meant government-designated wildlife corridors meant to extend their range through and beyond the Osa Peninsula were not working as well as designed. She came back to present those conclusions to local officials. After hours of searching, a troop of spider monkeys appeared  peering down at the humans who found them. Within moments, they were on their way again  extending their lanky arms and prehensile tails to grasp at trees and propel themselves across the canopy with spidery acrobatics. Unattended acoustic detection of animal sounds is valuable not just in rainforests but in a wide variety of ecosystems, according to the Science paper published earlier this year. For example, it could help sailors avoid colliding their ships with large baleen whales heard to be passing through a shipping channel. Lavista Ferres said there are still numerous challenges to overcome, from humidity that can fray jungle monitors to elephants in African savannas unintentionally knocking them off a tree. Lawson said using the audio monitors to capture the spider monkeys distinctive whinny enables biologists to study a larger area at lower cost, but also provides a truer account of how the monkeys behave without scientists following them around. Were reducing our influence on their behavior, she said. And also  they dont want us here. Source: AP --Agencies",

        "date": "December 25, 2024 04:10 pm",
        "content": "An Azerbaijani airliner with 67 people onboard crashed Wednesday in the Kazakhstani city of Aktau, leaving at least 32 survivors, according to officials. More than 30 people are likely dead. Kazakhstans Emergency Ministry said in a Telegram statement that those on board included five crew. At least 29 have been hospitalized, the ministry told Russias state news agency RIA Novosti. Russian news agency Interfax quoted medical workers as saying that four bodies have been recovered and emergency workers at the scene as saying that both pilots, according to a preliminary assessment, died in the crash. The Embraer 190 aircraft made an emergency landing 3 km from the city, Azerbaijan Airlines said earlier. Kazakhstans Emergency Ministry initially said 25 people survived the crash, later revising that number to 27, 28, and then 29 as the search and rescue operation continued at the site of the crash, bringing the supposed death toll down. Prosecutor Generals Office in Azerbaijan later reported that at least 32 people survived the crash, adding that the number wasnt final. The number of survivors could mean that over 30 people may be dead. The plane was originally scheduled to travel from the Azerbaijani capital of Baku to the Russian city of Grozny in the North Caucasus. According to Azerbaijan Airlines, 37 passengers were Azerbaijani citizens. There were also 16 Russian nationals, six Kazakhstani and three Kyrgyzstani citizens, it said. RIA Novosti quoted Russias civil aviation authority, Rosaviatsia, as saying that preliminary information showed that the pilot had chosen to divert to Aktau after a bird strike on the aircraft led to an emergency situation on board. Mobile phone footage circulating online appeared to show the aircraft making a steep descent before smashing into the ground in a fireball. Other footage showed part of its fuselage ripped away from the wings and the rest of the aircraft, lying upside in the grass. The footage corresponded to the planes colors and its registration number. Some of the videos posted on social media showed survivors dragging fellow passengers away from the wreckage of the plane. Flight-tracking data from FlightRadar24.com showed the aircraft making what appeared to be a figure-right once nearing the airport in Aktau, its altitude moving up and down substantially over the last minutes of the flight before impacting the ground. FlightRadar24 separately said in an online post that the aircraft had faced strong GPS jamming which  made the aircraft transmit bad ADS-B data, referring to the information that allows flight-tracking websites to follow planes in flight. Russia has been blamed in the past for jamming GPS transmissions in the wider region. Embraer did not immediately respond to a request for comment early Wednesday morning. In a statement, Azerbaijan Airlines said it would keep members of the public updated and changed its social media banners to solid black. Azerbaijans state news agency, Azertac, said that an official delegation consisting of Azerbaijans emergency situations minister, the countrys deputy general prosecutor, and the vice president of Azerbaijan Airlines had been dispatched to Aktau to conduct an on-site investigation. Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev, who had been traveling to St Petersburg, returned to Azerbaijan on hearing news of the crash, the presidents press service said. Aliyev was due to attend an informal meeting of leaders of Commonwealth of Independent States, a bloc of former Soviet countries founded after the collapse of the Soviet Union. Aliyev expressed his condolences to the families of the victims in a statement on social media. It is with deep sadness that I express my condolences to the families of the victims and wish a speedy recovery to those injured, he wrote. Russian President Vladimir Putin spoke to Aliyev on the phone and expressed his condolences, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters. Both Kazakhstani and Azerbaijani authorities were investigating the crash. Embraer told The Associated Press in a statement that the company is ready to assist all relevant authorities.

        "date": "December 25, 2024 09:06 pm",
        "content": "Pope Francis in his traditional Christmas message on Wednesday urged all people of all nations to find courage during this Holy Year to silence the sounds of arms and overcome divisions plaguing the world, from the Middle East to Ukraine, Africa to Asia. The pontiffs Urbi et Orbi  To the City and the World  address serves as a summary of the woes facing the world this year. As Christmas coincided with the start of the 2025 Holy Year celebration that he dedicated to hope, Francis called for broad reconciliation, even (with) our enemies. I invite every individual, and all people of all nations ... to become pilgrims of hope, to silence the sounds of arms and overcome divisions, the pope said from the loggia of St. Peters Basilica to throngs of people below. The pope invoked the Holy Door of St. Peters Basilica, which he opened on Christmas Eve to launch the 2025 Jubilee, as representing Gods mercy, which unties every knot; it tears down every wall of division; it dispels hatred and the spirit of revenge. He called for arms to be silenced in war-torn Ukraine and in the Middle East, singling out Christian communities in Israel and the Palestinian territories, particularly in Gaza where the humanitarian situation is extremely grave, as well as Lebanon and Syria at this most delicate time. Francis repeated his calls for the release of hostages taken from Israel by Hamas on Oct. 7, 2023. He cited a deadly outbreak of measles in the Democratic Republic of Congo, and the suffering of the people of Myanmar, forced to flee their homes by the ongoing clash of arms. The pope likewise remembered children suffering from war and hunger, the elderly living in solitude, those fleeing their homelands, who have lost their jobs, and are persecuted for their faith. Pilgrims were lined up on Christmas Day to walk through the great Holy Door at the entrance of St. Peters Basilica, as the Jubilee is expected to bring some 32 million Catholic faithful to Rome. Traversing the Holy Door is one way that the faithful can obtain indulgences, or forgiveness for sins during a Jubilee, a once-every-quarter-century tradition that dates from 1300. Pilgrims submitted to security controls before entering the Holy Door, amid new security fears following a deadly Christmas market attack in Germany. Many paused to touch the door as they passed and made the sign of the cross upon entering the basilica dedicated to St. Peter, the founder of the Roman Catholic Church. You feel so humble when you go through the door that once you go through is almost like a release, a release of emotions, said Blanca Martin, a pilgrim from San Diego. ... Its almost like a release of emotions, you feel like now you are able to let go and put everything in the hands of God. See I am getting emotional. Its just a beautiful experience. A Chrismukkah miracle as Hanukkah and Christmas coincide Hanukkah, Judaisms eight-day Festival of Lights, begins this year on Christmas Day, which has only happened four times since 1900. The calendar confluence has inspired some religious leaders to host interfaith gatherings, such as a Hanukkah party hosted last week by several Jewish organizations in Houston, Texas, bringing together members of the citys Latino and Jewish communities for latkes, the traditional potato pancake eaten on Hanukkah, topped with guacamole and salsa. While Hanukkah is intended as an upbeat, celebratory holiday, rabbis note that its taking place this year as wars rage in the Middle East and fears rise over widespread incidents of antisemitism. The holidays overlap infrequently because the Jewish calendar is based on lunar cycles and is not in sync with the Gregorian calendar, which sets Christmas on Dec. 25. The last time Hanukkah began on Christmas Day was in 2005. Iraqi Christians persist in their faith Christians in Nineveh Plains attended Christmas Mass on Tuesday at the Mar Georgis church in the center of Telaskaf, Iraq, with security concerns about the future. We feel that they will pull the rug out from under our feet at any time. Our fate is unknown here, said Bayda Nadhim, a resident of Telaskaf. Iraqs Christians, whose presence there goes back nearly to the time of Christ, belong to a number of rites and denominations. They once constituted a sizeable minority in Iraq, estimated at around 1.4 million. But the community has steadily dwindled since the 2003 US-led invasion and further in 2014 when the Islamic State militant group swept through the area. The exact number of Christians left in Iraq is unclear, but they are thought to number several hundred thousand. German celebrations muted by market attack German celebrations were darkened by a car attack on a Christmas market in Magdeburg on Friday that left five people dead, including a 9-year-old boy, and 200 people injured. President Frank-Walter Steinmeier rewrote his recorded Christmas Day speech to address the attack, saying that there is grief, pain, horror and incomprehension over what took place in Magdeburg. He urged Germans to stand together and that hate and violence must not have the last word. A 50-year-old Saudi doctor who had practiced medicine in Germany since 2006 was arrested on suspicion of murder, attempted murder and bodily harm. The suspects X account describes him as a former Muslim and is filled with anti-Islamic themes. He criticized authorities for failing to combat the Islamification of Germany and voiced support for the anti-immigration Alternative for Germany (AfD) party. Source: AP --Agencies",

        "content": "A two minutes silence will be observed island-wide today (26 December) on National Safety Day from 9.25 a.m. to 9.27 a.m. in memory of all who lost their lives in the 2004 tsunami and other natural disasters in Sri Lanka, the Disaster Management Center (DMC) said. This year, arrangements have been made to observe National Safety Day at the district level across the island, with the main event scheduled to take place in front of the Peraliya Tsunami Memorial Statue in Galle. Today (Dec. 26) marks the 20th anniversary of the 2004 Boxing Day Tsunami, one of the worlds deadliest and most destructive natural disasters, which impacted over 10 countries in the Indian Ocean. Thus, a two minutes silence will be observed island-wide today from 9.25 a.m. to 9.27 a.m. in memory of all who lost their lives in the 2004 tsunami and other natural disasters in Sri Lanka, as per the DMC. A powerful undersea megathrust earthquake, which registered a magnitude of 9.1, struck off the coast of Sumatra Island, Indonesia on a Sunday morning, 26th of December 2004. About 20 minutes after the shock, Indonesias capital Banda Aceh, which was closest to the epicentre of the earthquake, was devastated by massive 100-foot waves, claiming the lives of more than 100,000. A series of turbulent waves then ravaged the coasts of Indonesia, Sri Lanka, India, Thailand, Maldives, Myanmar and Andaman and Nicobar Islands. In all, deaths from the disaster mounted over 230,000 in a matter of hours. Sri Lanka was one of the hardest-hit countries with over 40,000 fatalities and property damage worth several million rupees. Thousands were left homeless as waves pushed debris several kilometres inland, pounding buildings into rubble. Since 2005, the 26th of December has been declared as National Safety Day and on that day commemoration events are held as a continuous national event each year, with the participation of the political leadership in remembrance of all those who lost their lives in the country due to the various natural disasters including the tsunami disaster.",

        "content": "Authorities in Russias southern Krasnodar region on Wednesday declared a region-wide emergency, saying that oil was still washing up on the coastline 10 days after two ageing tankers ran into trouble. The oil is from the tankers which were hit by a storm on Dec. 15. One of the vessels split in half, while the other ran aground. The pollution, which has coated sandy beaches at and around Anapa, a popular summer resort, has caused serious problems for seabirds and everything from dolphins to porpoises and over 10,000 people have been trying to clear it up. Veniamin Kondratiev, governor of the Krasnodar region, said in a statement that he had decided to declare a region-wide emergency because oil was still polluting the coastline in the Anapa and Temryuk districts. He had previously declared a less serious municipal-level emergency. Initially, according to the calculations of scientists and specialists, the main mass of fuel oil should have remained at the bottom of the Black Sea, which would have allowed it to be collected in the water, Kondratiev wrote on the Telegram messaging app. But the weather dictates its own conditions, the air warms up and oil products rise to the top. As a result, they are being carried to our beaches. Separately, a crisis centre focused on the clean-up said that the bow of one of the tankers - the Volgoneft-239 - had been discovered underwater and that divers would check whether there was any leak of oil products from it as soon as weather conditions permitted. In total, more than 256 square kilometres of the coastal area have been surveyed and 25 tons of oil-water sludge collected, the same centre said. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

There are police officers who receive their salaries from the underworld and drug trafficking activities. Following intelligence reports, we had to transfer almost the entire police force in Ruwanwella. Not only that but also in Avissawella. These individuals are a network. The underworlds money is flowing into the hands of the police, he added. Deputy Minister Watagala also noted that discussions had been held with the Acting Inspector General of Police (IGP) regarding the issue and revealed that the current leader of the underworld is operating in Mathugama. We see this as a serious problem. It is difficult to disclose all the measures we have taken through the media. Some decisions have been made at the ministerial level regarding drugs and the underworld activities, he said. The Deputy Minister further mentioned that the implementation of these measures has been entrusted to a team led by the police chief.

        "date": "December 26, 2024 04:38 pm",
        "content": "Bangladesh on Thursday ordered a commission to investigate a failed 2009 army mutiny and subsequent crackdown, including the role of alleged foreign backers, the inquiry chief said. The violent mutiny sent shock waves through the South Asian nation and ended with the army crushing the mutineers, with scores arrested and sentenced to death. A previous official investigation into the mutiny which left scores dead blamed years of pent-up anger among ordinary soldiers, who felt their appeals for pay rises and better treatment were ignored. But that probe was carried out during the tenure of Sheikh Hasina, who was ousted as prime minister by a revolution in August, when she fled to old ally India. Since her fall, families of soldiers killed in the violence have been campaigning to reopen the investigation. They have repeatedly accused Hasina -- then newly elected -- of orchestrating a plan to weaken the military to bolster her own power in a country prone to coups. Protesters have also alleged Indias involvement in that plot. The claims are likely to infuriate New Delhi, which did not immediately respond to the allegations. We aim to determine whether any foreign entity was involved in the carnage, as allegations of national and international conspiracy have been raised, commission chief A.L.M. Fazlur Rahman told reporters. The mutineers stole thousands of weapons in February 2009 from the headquarters of the Bangladesh Rifles (BDR) paramilitary squad before embarking on a killing spree in the barracks . The uprising quickly spread, with thousands of soldiers seizing weapons and pledging allegiance to the mutineers before it was quashed by the army. Thousands were rounded up and tried in special military courts in the aftermath of the massacre, as the then newly-elected government of Hasina wrestled to regain control. Hundreds of soldiers were handed punishments ranging from death to a few years, with the United Nations criticising the process for failing to meet basic standards. Hasinas iron-fisted rule was backed by New Delhi, and the 77-year-old remains in India, adding to fraying relations between the nations. On Monday, Dhaka said it had requested India send Hasina back, to face charges of massacres, killings, and crimes against humanity. Source: AFP --Agencies",

        "date": "December 26, 2024 06:47 pm",
        "content": "A press briefing on the economic stabilization process and the proposed relief packages for the public was held today (26) at the Presidential Media Center (PMC). Minister of Labor and Deputy Minister of Economic Development, Dr. Anil Jayantha Fernando, along with Deputy Minister of Finance and Planning, Dr. Harshana Suriyapperuma, attended the briefing. The media statement released during the press briefing is as follows: Press Statement on the Economic Stabilization Process and Relief Packages to People 1. Economic Stabilization Economic stabilization is key to taking the country out of the abyss created by past regimes. At the time the government assumed office those who are responsible for the crisis had unilaterally suspended external debt servicing in April 2022, entered into IMF program for an Extended fund facility (EFF) of approximately USD 3 billion over a period of 4 years to be received in 8 installments, and paddled through the IMF program and debt restructuring process connected to in line with debt sustainability analysis connected to it. The delayed and complex nature of the debt restructuring process incurred additional costs to the country and created additional burdens on the people. However, after, considering both the pros and cons of the context that prevailed at that time in terms of social, political and economic perspective, the government proceeded with the options in the best interest of the people of the country. Accordingly, it was possible to reach the staff-level agreement of the third review on 26th November 2024, in line with the program parameters, and government revenue measures with appropriate engagement, and timely facilitation. In the lead-up to the board approval from the IMF, the government is engaging with necessary stakeholders to obtain the next tranche of the EFF. Debt Restructuring It consists of both domestic and external restructuring. Domestic debt restructuring was completed in July 2023. External restructuring excludes multilateral creditors on various grounds and arguments. The rest consists of official bilateral debt and private ISB holders. Bilateral Debt The bilateral debt is dealt with the Official Creditor Committee (OCC) co-chaired by France, India and Japan representing 17 countries, China Exim Bank, China Development bank, other official creditors (Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Iran and Pakistan) and other commercial creditors. OCC had agreed to the terms and conditions in June 2024 and the loans with China Exim Bank had already been restructured in October 2023 within the agreed framework, ensuring comparability of treatment (CoT). Except for the other official creditors (Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Iran and Pakistan) accounting for roughly USD 300 million representing about 1 of total external debt subject to restructuring, all other bilateral creditors have already agreed to restructure within the agreed framework. ISB Creditors Much delayed ISB restructuring had passed several stages of negotiations with agreements, disagreements, changes to proposals, and adjustments in line with DSA and IMF consents, had finally agreed in principle (AIP) on 19 September 2024 just two days prior to the presidential election. Ad Hoc Group (AHG) and Local banking consortium represent ISBs which account for USD 14.2 billion including a past due interest of USD 1.7 billion. By prioritizing and facilitating actions in a timely manner, the new government has demonstrated a strong political commitment to steering the country toward economic stability. These efforts toward financial stability have been independently acknowledged by third parties, including rating agencies which have upgraded the ratings by several notches, which was only possible due to the correct prioritization and implementation of economic stabilization measures. Hence, the government continued with the restructuring process and facilitated it to ensure the successful completion of the issuance of new bonds for the exchange of existing ones on 20th December 2024 in order to achieve the critical objective of stabilizing the economy in pursuit of navigating the country with the growth and development trajectory towards a thriving nation and beautiful life. ________________________________________ 2. SME Sector Facilitation 2.a.1. Parate Extension Instead of merely postponing the Parate execution date, the government engaged with stakeholder groups to ensure acceptable solutions were found for this long-standing issue. As a result, the Parate execution has now been extended until 31st March 2025. 2.a.2. Relief Package The relief for businesses is not only in the form of an extension of time. Based on data provided by the Central Bank, 99 of borrowers with outstanding capital of less than 25 million rupees in restructured loans have been granted a 12-month extension to renegotiate with banks and agree on a settlement path. Borrowers with debts between 25,000,000 and 50,000,000 rupees have been granted a 9-month extension, while all other borrowers are entitled to a 6-month extension. This relief package, proposed by the government and to be implemented through the Central Bank, also includes several other important measures, such as easing the credit rating status, extending the repayment period, offering low interest rates for restructured debt, and providing a transparent mechanism to resolve valuation disputes. This package aims to ensure that the SME sector can actively contribute to the economy. 2.b. School Stationery Assistance for School Children 2.b.1. Children in the Aswesuma Families To ease the burden on parents from vulnerable groups in society, Rs. 6,000 per child has been allocated to purchase essential school books and stationery for the upcoming school term. Children from Aswesuma recipient families will begin receiving this benefit shortly. 2.b.2. Children Not Receiving Aswesuma Children from families who are not currently receiving Aswesuma but are facing economic hardship will also be provided with this benefit, based on recommendations from the Ministry of Education. It is expected that the process will be finalized soon, and the disbursement scheme will start within a few days, ensuring that all deserving children facing economic hardship receive assistance.",

        "content": "Manmohan Singh, the former Indian prime minister who governed the South Asian country for two terms and liberalised its economy in an earlier stint as finance minister, has died, local media reported on Thursday. He was 92. Singh, an economist-turned-politician who also served as the governor of the central bank, was ailing and admitted to the All India Institute of Medical Sciences in New Delhi, local media reported late on Thursday. Singh was admitted to the emergency ward of Delhis All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) at around 8 pm. The veteran Congress leader retired from the Rajya Sabha in April after 33-year-long stint in the Upper House. Dr Manmohan Singh served as prime minister of India from 2004 to 2014. With profound grief, we inform the demise of the former Prime Minister of India, Dr Manmohan Singh, aged 92. He was being treated for age-related medical conditions and had a sudden loss of consciousness at home on 26 December 2024. Resuscitative measures were started immediately at home. He was brought to the Medical Emergency at AIIMS, New Delhi at 8:06 PM. Despite all efforts, he could not be revived and was declared dead at 9:51 PM, the AIIMS said in a statement. Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra and BJP President and Union Minister JP Nadda have reached the hospital. The two-time Indian prime minister and noted economist ushered in the landmark reforms of 1991 during his stint as the finance minister in the Narasimha Rao government. Singh was chosen to lead the United Progressive Alliance government in 2004 after the coalition romped home to a victory against the incumbent BJP-led National Democratic Alliance government. He signed the landmark civil nuclear deal with the United States in July 2005. Singh returned for a second term which was marked by increasing coalition pressures and corruption charges against his government. The Cambridge alumus returned to India and went on to present the 1991 Union budget that ushered in liberalisation and globalisation under the weight of IMFs bailout conditions. Quoting Victor Hugo, Singh said: No power on Earth can stop an idea whose time has come. A man of humility and intellect, Dr. Singh was a respected figure both in India and globally. Under his leadership, India saw consistent economic growth, reducing poverty and strengthening the countrys position on the world stage. His government was also known for implementing crucial legislation in areas such as education, food security, and information. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday expressed grief over the death of former PM Manmohan Singh. Taking to X, PM Modi wrote: India mourns the loss of one of its most distinguished leaders, Dr. Manmohan Singh Ji. Rising from humble origins, he rose to become a respected economist. He served in various government positions as well, including as Finance Minister, leaving a strong imprint on our economic policy over the years. His interventions in Parliament were also insightful. As our Prime Minister, he made extensive efforts to improve peoples lives. --Agencies",

        "date": "December 27, 2024 08:53 am",
        "content": "A Pakistani military court sentenced sixty civilians to jail time ranging from 2 to 10 years in connection with attacks on military facilities following the arrest of former prime minister Imran Khan in 2023, the militarys media wing said on Thursday. Those sentenced include a relative of Khan as well as two retired military officers. Days earlier, 25 others were sentenced on the same charges. Khans arrest in May 2023 sparked countrywide protests that saw his supporters attack and ransack military installations in an unprecedented backlash against Pakistans powerful army generals. The militarys media wing said, The Nation, Government, and the Armed Forces remain steadfast in their commitment to upholding justice and ensuring that the inviolable writ of the state is maintained. The sentences have sparked concerns among Khans supporters that military courts will play a more significant role in cases related to the former leader, who is facing multiple charges, including inciting attacks against the armed forces. The international community has also expressed concerns over the sentencing. The United States stated it is deeply concerned about the sentences, while the United Kingdoms foreign office noted that trying civilians in military courts lacks transparency, independent scrutiny and undermines the right to a fair trial. The European Union also criticized the sentences, saying they are inconsistent with the obligations that Pakistan has undertaken under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. In a press conference on Wednesday, the information minister said the military court sentences do not infringe upon the right to a fair trial, as individuals are granted access to a lawyer, family, and still have the opportunity to appeal twice, both within the military court and civilian court, the relevant high court. Khans supporters have denied any wrongdoing, and Khan himself claims that the cases against him are politically motivated. The military and government have denied any unfair treatment of Khan or his supporters. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

Prime minister Han has been acting president since president Yoon Suk Yeol was impeached on December 14th over his short-lived imposition of martial law on December 3rd, and his presidential powers were suspended. After Mr Hans impeachment, finance minister Choi Sang-mok is next in line to assume the acting presidency, according to South Korean law. Some 192 lawmakers voted to impeach Han out of the 300-member parliament. The main opposition Democratic Party (DP), which controls parliament, decided to impeach Mr Han after he did not immediately appoint three justices to fill vacancies at the constitutional court. The DP-controlled parliament backed three nominees on Thursday, but Han said he would not formally appoint them unless there was bipartisan agreement on the appointments. There has been disagreement between the ruling and opposition parties and some constitutional scholars over whether a simple majority or a two-thirds vote is needed to impeach the acting president. However, parliament speaker Woo Won-shik, who is from the DP, said only a simple majority was needed to impeach Han. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "content": "NASA said on Friday that its Parker Solar Probe was safe and operating normally after successfully completing the closest-ever approach to the Sun by any human-made object. The spacecraft passed just 3.8 million miles (6.1 million km) from the solar surface on Dec. 24, flying into the suns outer atmosphere called the corona, on a mission to help scientists learn more about Earths closest star. The agency said the operations team at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory in Maryland received the signal, a beacon tone, from the probe just before midnight on Thursday. The spacecraft is expected to send detailed telemetry data about its status on Jan. 1, NASA added. Moving at up to 430,000 mph (692,000 kph), the spacecraft endured temperatures of up to 1,800 degrees Fahrenheit (982 degrees Celsius), according to the NASA website. This close-up study of the Sun allows Parker Solar Probe to take measurements that help scientists better understand how material in this region gets heated to millions of degrees, trace the origin of the solar wind (a continuous flow of material escaping the Sun), and discover how energetic particles are accelerated to near light speed, the agency added. The Parker Solar Probe was launched in 2018 and has been gradually circling closer towards the sun, using flybys of Venus to gravitationally pull it into a tighter orbit with the sun.

The makeshift boat was carrying around 80 people when it capsized. Only 11 survived, the Ministry of Malians Abroad said in a statement on Thursday, after collecting information to reconstruct the incident. A crisis unit has been set up to monitor the situation and will report any further updates, it added. The Atlantic migration route from the coast of West Africa to the Canary Islands, typically used by African migrants trying to reach Spain, has seen a surge this year. Years of conflict in the Sahel region that includes Mali, unemployment and the impact of climate change on farming communities are among the reasons why people attempt the crossing. The route, which traces the Atlantic coasts of Mauritania and Morocco up to Spain, is one of the worlds deadliest. An unprecedented nearly 5,000 migrants died at sea in the first five months of 2024 trying to reach the Spanish archipelago, migration rights group Walking Borders said in June.

        "date": "December 27, 2024 06:29 pm",
        "content": "President Frank-Walter Steinmeier on Friday dissolved Germanys lower house of parliament to pave the way for snap elections on Feb. 23 following the collapse of Chancellor Olaf Scholzs three-way coalition. Especially in difficult times, like now, stability requires a government capable of acting, and reliable majorities in parliament, which was why early elections were the right way forward for Germany, Steinmeier said in Berlin. After the elections, problem-solving must become the core business of politics again, added Steinmeier in a speech. The president, whose post has been largely ceremonial in the post-war era, also called for the election campaign to be conducted fairly and transparently. External influence is a danger to democracy, whether it is covert, as was evidently the case recently in the Romanian elections, or open and blatant, as is currently being practiced particularly intensively on (social media) platform X, he said. Scholz, a Social Democrat who will head a caretaker government until a new one can be formed, lost a confidence vote in parliament earlier this month after the departure of Finance Minister Christian Lindners Free Democrats left his unwieldy governing coalition without a legislative majority. The vote also kicked off election campaigning in earnest, with conservative challenger Friedrich Merz, who surveys suggest is likely to replace Scholz, asserting that the incumbent government had imposed excessive regulations and stifled growth. The conservatives hold a comfortable lead of more than 10 points over the Social Democrats (SPD) in most polls. The far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) is slightly ahead of the SPD, while the Greens, a coalition partner, are in fourth place. The mainstream parties have refused to govern with the AfD, but its presence complicates the parliamentary arithmetic, making shaky coalitions more likely. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "date": "December 28, 2024 08:56 am",
        "content": "White House spokesman John Kirby has said the US has seen early indications that Russia may have been responsible for the downing of the Azerbaijan Airlines plane that crashed on 25 December, killing 38 people. Mr Kirby did not elaborate further, but told reporters the US had offered assistance to the investigation into the crash. The plane is thought to have come under fire from Russian air defence systems as it tried to land in Chechnya before being diverted across the Caspian Sea to Kazakhstan, where it crashed. The Kremlin has refused to comment, but the head of Russias civil aviation agency said the situation in Chechnya was very complicated due to Ukrainian drone strikes on the region. Mr Kirby said the indications the US had seen went beyond widely circulated photos of the damaged plane, the Washington Post reported. Aviation experts and others in Azerbaijan believe the planes GPS systems were affected by electronic jamming and it was then damaged by shrapnel from Russian air-defence missile blasts. Azerbaijan has not accused Russia, but the countrys transport minister said the plane was subject to external interference and damaged inside and out as it tried to land. All the survivors without exception stated they heard three blast sounds when the aircraft was above Grozny, said Rashad Nabiyev. Mr Nabiyev said investigators would now examine what kind of weapon, or rather what kind of rocket was used. However, pro-government MP Rasim Musabekov was clear: The plane was shot down over Russian territory, in the skies above Grozny. Denying this is impossible. He told AFP news agency the plane had been damaged and the pilot had asked to make an emergency landing in Grozny. Instead of being directed to nearby airports, he said it was sent far away across the Caspian Sea without GPS. Flight attendant Zulfuqar Asadov described the moments when the plane was hit by some kind of external strike over Chechnya. The impact of it caused panic inside. We tried to calm them down, to get them seated. At that moment, there was another strike, and my arm was injured. The pilots of the Embraer 190 plane are credited with saving 29 of those on board by managing to land part of the plane, despite themselves being killed in the crash. The Kremlin has refused to comment on the increasing number of reports that the Azerbaijan Airlines plane was hit by Russian air defence. An investigation into this aviation incident is underway and until the conclusions are made as a result of the investigation, we do not consider ourselves entitled to give any assessments, said spokesman Dmitry Peskov. Kazakh authorities have been treating the injured and working closely with Azerbaijan on the investigation. Reports in Baku suggest both Russia and Kazakhstan have proposed having a committee from the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) - a regional organisation dominated by Russia - investigate the crash, but Azerbaijan has instead demanded an international inquiry.

He further stated that the festive season has caused a slight increase in waste generation, with the daily waste production in Colombo normally ranging between 420 and 450 tonnes. However, due to the large number of people arriving in Colombo by December 31, we predict that this amount could be around 500 tons, he added.

        "content": "The Cinnamon Development Department unveiled plans to increase Sri Lankas annual income from cinnamon exports to USD 500 million, doubling the current revenue of USD 250 million. Director General of the department, Janaka Lindara highlighted that Sri Lanka produces approximately 25,000 metric tons of cinnamon annually, exporting around 19,000 metric tons. Cinnamon is a key export crop for the nation, traditionally cultivated in areas like Galle, Matara, and Hambantota. To meet the new targets, the department plans to expand cinnamon cultivation to regions such as Kurunegala, Puttalam, and Mahaweli zones. These efforts aim to boost production and diversify the geographical base of cultivation, according to the departments DG. Furthermore, he added that a significant milestone in this initiative is the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with China, paving the way for cinnamon exports to begin in January 2025. Additionally, the department plans to strengthen its presence in the European Union and other international markets. While the majority of Sri Lankas cinnamon is currently exported as raw material, the department is emphasizing the production of value-added products to maximize foreign exchange earnings. Efforts are underway to support small and medium-scale cinnamon entrepreneurs with resources and incentives to encourage this shift, the department mentioned.",

        "title": "Sri Lankas economic recovery must be coupled with Indias growth - Ranil",
        "date": "December 28, 2024 01:58 pm",
        "content": "Combining Sri Lankas economic recovery with Indias sustained and swift economic growth and technological advancement will establish larger markets for the island country and give it a path away from debt-fuelled growth of the last two decades, according to former president Ranil Wickremesinghe. The 2024 statement (India-Sri Lanka joint statement issued this month during island President Anura Kumara Dissanayakes visit) is explicit on moving Sri Lanka away from a debt-driven economic model, Wickremesinghe said Friday at the 7th Atal Bihari Vajpayee Memorial Lecture organised by India Foundation at India Habitat Centre in New Delhi. For two decades, Sri Lankas economy has relied heavily on excessive debts, culminating in bankruptcy and an economic meltdown. Therefore, the strategy in this statement is to enhance Sri Lankas economic development by coupling our economic recovery with Indias sustained and swift economic growth and technological advancement, he added. Wickremesinghe further said that it was expected that India would be the third largest economic power in the world by 2040. By then, Tamil Nadus GDP (gross domestic product) would have exceeded 1 trillion. This is the powerhouse to which Sri Lanka has to connect as a region, he asserted during the lecture chaired by former Union minister Suresh Prabhu. Wickremesinghe, who has been Sri Lankas prime minister six times, lost the presidential race in September this year to Dissanayake. He had taken over as leader of Sri Lanka at the height of its economic crisis in 2022, when the nation declared itself as bankrupt due to a balance of payments crisis. New Delhi stepped in with emergency loans worth 4 billion, which helped sustain the economy to a degree till a bailout package could be negotiated with the International Monetary Fund (IMF). However, ties between India and Sri Lanka, especially deeper economic linkages, have not always been welcomed domestically within the island nation. In 2017, the two governments also entered into an MoU (memorandum of understanding) on cooperation in economic projects under the agenda for bilateral economic cooperation whenever such cooperation (economic) is attempted, some of the trade unions and political parties in Sri Lanka oppose it, said Wickremesinghe. Even in this instance, trade unions came out on strike against the Trincomalee oil tank farm proposal. Some of the political parties even called for its abolition however, the calamity of COVID-19 and consequential economic crisis in Sri Lanka (sic). At the most crucial moment, when Sri Lanka declared bankruptcy India stepped up valiantly to help us, he added. The aid changed the course of India-Sri Lanka ties, with all political parties in the island nation arriving at a consensus to deepen economic linkages with New Delhi. Wickremesinghe pointed to the support he received from Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (political party) in 2023, when India and Sri Lanka announced their economic partnership vision during his visit to New Delhi in July. Earlier this month, during Dissanayakes visit to India, the National Peoples Power political party led by him, so far perceived as the only holdout to the economic partnership, also joined in announcing the India-Sri Lanka statement on fostering partnerships. This political consensus did not exist till the turn of the current decade. In the previous decade, Sri Lanka had looked to China to help in its debt-fuelled economic growth, especially for funding of large infrastructure projects. Between 2000 and 2021, China lent 20.5 billion to Sri Lanka for its projects, with a large amount of money disbursed between 2009 and 2014, according to AidData, a global research institute. Projects included the Hambantota International Port, which received over 1 billion in funding from China, before being leased to a Chinese corporation in 2017 for 99 years. Another example of debt-funded projects is the Mattala Rajapaksa International Airport in Hambantota, which was built with almost 200 million in loans from China. Economic partnership agreement still elusive The current economic vision for India and Sri Lanka has been at least two decades in the making, with Wickremesinghe pointing to the late Atal Bihari Vajpayees premiership in India as kickstarting the talks towards a comprehensive economic partnership agreement way back in 2003. During his lecture, Wickremesinghe said that in 2001, during his visit to India as Sri Lanka PM on the invitation of Vajpayee, the Sri Lankan army was on the backfoot in its war against the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE). Wickremesinghe, who had campaigned on a peace platform during the 2001 polls which led to his victory, had come to India seeking New Delhis backing for a ceasefire with the LTTE. Vajpayee supported the ceasefire effort, and the Sri Lankan government signed a ceasefire agreement with the LTEE in February 2002. As part of a joint statement on 24 December, 2001, India promised to provide 25,000 tonne of wheat per month to Sri Lanka for one year, as well as to study the feasibility of building a land bridge connecting Tamil Nadu with the island nation. Two years later, in October 2003, the India-Sri Lanka Joint Study Group presented recommendations on the feasibility of a comprehensive economic partnership agreement between the two countries to both Vajpayee and Wickremesinghe during the latters visit to New Delhi. Expressing their satisfaction on the speed with which the joint study group prepared its comprehensive report with its far-reaching recommendations, the prime ministers congratulated the members of the group and directed that negotiations begin immediately, with the target of concluding the comprehensive economic partnership agreement by the end of March 2004, said their joint statement. However, as Wickremesinghe explained, both leaders were out of office the following year, which prevented them from coming together for a comprehensive agreement relating to goods and services. India and Sri Lanka currently maintain a Free Trade Agreement, first signed in 1998, which came into effect in 2000. However, a comprehensive economic partnership agreement continues to remain elusive, despite completed negotiations. Source: The Print --Agencies",

        "date": "December 28, 2024 05:05 pm",
        "content": "US President-elect Donald Trump has asked the US Supreme Court to delay an upcoming TikTok ban while he works on a political resolution. His lawyer filed a legal brief on Friday with the court that says Trump opposes banning TikTok and seeks the ability to resolve the issues at hand through political means once he takes office. On 10 January, the court is due to hear arguments on a US law that requires TikToks Chinese owner, ByteDance, to sell the social media company to an American firm or face a ban come 19 January - a day before Trump takes office. US officials and lawmakers had accused ByteDance of being linked to the Chinese government - which the firm denies. Those allegations of an app that has 170 million users in the US led Congress to pass a bill in April, which President Joe Biden signed into law, that included the divest or ban requirement. TikTok and ByteDance have filed multiple legal challenges against the law, arguing that it threatens American free speech protections, with little success. With no potential buyer materialising so far, the companies final chance to derail the ban has been via the American high court. While the Supreme Court has previously declined to act on a request for an emergency injunction against the law, it agreed to allow TikTok, ByteDance and the US government to plead their cases on 10 January - just days before the ban is due to take effect. Trump had met with TikToks CEO, Shou Zi Chew, at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida last week. In his court filing on Friday, Trump said the case represents an unprecedented, novel, and difficult tension between free-speech rights on one side, and foreign policy and national security concerns on the other. While the filing said that Trump takes no position on the underlying merits of this dispute, it added that pushing back the 19 January deadline would grant Trump the opportunity to pursue a political resolution to the matter without having to resort to the court. The US justice department has argued that alleged Chinese links to TikTok present a national security threat - and multiple state governments have raised concerns about the popular social media app. Nearly two dozen state attorneys general led by Montanas Austin Knudsen have urged the Supreme Court to uphold the law compelling ByteDance and TikTok to divest or be banned. Earlier in December, a federal appeals court rejected an attempt to overturn the legislation, saying it was the culmination of extensive, bipartisan action by the Congress and successive presidents. Trump has publicly said he opposes the ban, despite supporting one in his first term as president. I have a warm spot in my heart for TikTok, because I won youth by 34 points, he claimed at a press conference earlier in December, although a majority of young voters backed his opponent, Kamala Harris. There are those that say that TikTok has something to do with that, he added. Source: BBC --Agencies",

Addressing the media after assuming office today (28), Mr. Thilaka clarified that the current salt supply is sufficient to meet household needs in the country. Two 400-gram packets of salt powder and one kilogram of crystal salt are enough for an average household for a month, he stated, emphasizing that unnecessary stockpiling is unwarranted. The chairman reassured the public that the Hambantota Lanka Salt Company currently has 6,000 metric tons of salt in stock, sufficient to last until January. Additionally, he added that plans are in place to import 30,000 metric tons of salt to prevent any potential shortages. Mr. Thilaka acknowledged that salt production has declined significantly this year, attributing the issue to long-standing neglect of the Jaffna salt pans. Since the end of the civil war in 2009, no government has taken steps to rehabilitate and utilize the salt pans in the Jaffna region for production, he explained. However, the chairman announced that development activities for the Jaffna salt pans are set to commence by mid-January, with production expected to begin by March 2025. He urged the public to remain calm and avoid creating unnecessary demand due to fear, assuring that all measures are being taken to maintain an adequate salt supply in the country.",

Joining Ada Deranas current affairs program Hydepark, he emphasized that establishing such a medical school in Sri Lanka, similar to the U.S.-based Harvard and Stanford universities, will boost Sri Lankas foreign revenue generation while also branding Sri Lanka amongst other nations as a hub of tertiary education. Dr. Bandula Wijay also called on the government to bring together educated experts from the United States and Sri Lanka, to form a think tank to generate comprehensive plans for navigating Sri Lankas way forward towards a developed nation. Speaking further in this regard, Dr. Wijay emphasized the necessity for Sri Lanka to brand itself as a Global Centre of Science, Technology and Innovation. He also suggested that Sri Lanka should establish a fund which will help finance start-ups that can establish Sri Lanka as a nation which excels in scientific innovation.
