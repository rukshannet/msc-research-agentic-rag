        "title": "BIMSTEC Secretary General visits Sri Lanka; briefs President on expectations from 6th summit",
        "date": "April 15, 2024 09:58 pm",
        "content": "The Secretary General of the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC) Indra Mani Pandey has undertaken an official visit to Sri Lanka recently. This was his first official visit to Sri Lanka since taking charge as Secretary General on 4 January this year. During the visit, the secretary general called on Ranil Wickremesinghe, President of Sri Lanka, M.U.M. Ali Sabry, PC., MP., Minister of Foreign Affairs of Sri Lanka, and Ramesh Pathirana, Minister of Health of Sri Lanka, said the BIMSTEC headquarters on Monday. He also held meetings with the Secretary to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Aruni Wijewardane; Secretary to the Prime Minister, Anura Dissanayake; Secretary to the Ministry of Health, Dr Palitha Maheepala; and the Secretary to the Ministry of Education, Thilaka Jayasundara. During his call on President Wickremesinghe, the Secretary General briefed the President on the state of progress in BIMSTEC since the 5th Summit that was held in Colombo in March 2022, and the expectations from the 6th Summit that is to be held in Bangkok. President Wickremesinghe reiterated Sri Lankas commitment to BIMSTEC and shared Sri Lankas priorities for regional cooperation. Recalling his participation in the BIMSTEC Foreign Ministers Retreat held in Bangkok in July 2023, Foreign Minister Ali Sabry stressed the importance of holding frequent and regular meetings at all levels of BIMSTEC to sustain momentum and ensure BIMSTECs success so that the people of the Bay of Bengal region are able to reap the benefits of regional cooperation. The secretary generals meeting with the Secretary to the Prime Minister, Anura Dissanayake, was in the context of Sri Lanka being the lead member State in BIMSTEC for Human Resource Development. They held detailed discussion on taking forward the BIMSTEC Human Resource Development agenda including the scheduling of the first meeting of the BIMSTEC Expert Group on Human Resource Development (HRD) that will consider the draft BIMSTEC Plan of Action on HRD. The meeting with the Minister of Health and the Secretary to the Ministry of Health involved detailed discussions on the way forward on the BIMSTEC Health agenda, in the context of Sri Lanka being the lead member State for cooperation in health in BIMSTEC, including convening of the first meeting of BIMSTEC Health Ministers. The meeting with the Secretary to the Ministry of Education involved discussions on the setting up of the BIMSTEC Technology Transfer Facility in Sri Lanka for which the Memorandum of Association was signed during the 5th BIMSTEC Summit in Colombo in 2022, as well as convening of the first meeting of its Governing Board. Apart from official meetings, the secretary general participated in a public interactive event organised by the Lakshman Kadirgamar Institute (LKI) on the theme Regional Cooperation through BIMSTEC, and in two roundtable sessions organised by the Advocata Institute and the Bandaranaike Centre for International Studies (BCIS). These events enabled him to interact with a range of officials, experts, academics, thought leaders, researchers, and students, and listen to their views and ideas on regional cooperation.

        "title": "Ghana fails to reach debt deal with international bondholders",
        "date": "April 15, 2024 10:12 pm",
        "content": "(Reuters) - Ghana has failed to agree a deal with two bondholder groups to restructure 13 billion of international bonds, the government said on Monday, in a blow to its efforts to swiftly emerge from default and economic crisis. Talks were on hold for now after the International Monetary Fund indicated that the deal would not fit its debt sustainability parameters, which set out how much debt it thinks a country can afford, the government said in a statement. Ghana had been in formal talks with two groups holding its international bonds since March 16 - one international group of Western asset managers and hedge funds and another one including regional African banks. The regional African bondholder group had also rejected part of the proposed rework, including an option to retain the original value of the bonds with a longer maturity and lower coupon. In December 2022, Ghana defaulted on most of its external debt of about 30 billion as it fell into economic crisis. Debt costs and inflation surged, reserves dwindled and the government found itself unable to access international bond markets. Growth in the worlds second biggest cocoa producer has since started to recover, with the economy growing 2.9 in 2023, better than the 2.3 the IMF predicted in January. The Government is actively working on solutions that it believes would be consistent with IMF program parameters under the set of policies currently being discussed, with the objective of reaching a mutual agreement acceptable to all parties, the government said in the regulatory statement. The dollar-denominated bonds, known as eurobonds, fell between 2.6 and 3.2 cents, with most of the maturities trading between the 46 and 48 cents in the dollar mark, according to Tradeweb data. Regional bondholders believe the Ghanaian economys strong performance compared to the IMFs original analysis could allow a deal to be reached by the end of 2024, Samuel Sule, Chief Executive Officer at Renaissance Capital Africa and financial advisor to the group, told Reuters. The IMF approved a 3 billion, three-year loan program for Ghana in May 2023, contingent on Ghana implementing reforms and finishing a debt restructuring that the fund deems sustainable. Ghanas government said the IMF had assessed the proposed bondholder deal against debt sustainability thresholds from the first review of the loan program, which was finished in January. The second review, in which thresholds could change, is ongoing. IMF staff has determined that this working scenario is not in line with program parameters, an IMF spokesperson said by email. The IMF will continue to support the ongoing restructuring negotiations. An advisor to the international bondholder committee said in a statement that restructuring discussions would continue this week. AT SOME POINT Ghana - together with Zambia and Ethiopia - is reworking its debt under the G20 Common Framework, a process set up during the COVID-19 pandemic to speed up debt overhauls. However, progress has been slow, holding back the countries economic recoveries and access to much needed overseas cheap loans, aid and investment. Zambia struggled to get its bond restructuring deal over the line amid objections from official creditors, though it eventually reached an agreement in principle in late March. Ghana is confident... at some point it will reach an agreement with bondholders, Finance Minister Mohammed Amin Adam told a press conference on Saturday. The IMFs Ghana mission chief Stephane Roudet told the joint news briefing, held to coincide with a staff-level agreement on the IMFs second review of its 3 billion loan programme, that the Fund needed to continue to see progress in talks with bondholders. Ghana is aiming to cut 10.5 billion from its external debt repayments and interest costs due from 2023 to 2026. It reached an agreement in principle in January to rework 5.4 billion of loans with official creditors, which will need to confirm that the bondholder deal is comparable to what they offered. The bondholder deal that had been proposed would have included a heavily discounted option of three bonds maturing between 2030 and 2038 with coupons of 5 until 2027 and 6.5 after. Another PAR option offering no principal reduction would have matured in 2043, with a 1.5 coupon. Bondholders who signed up for either option would have also received a separate bond representing accrued Past Due Interest. This bond and the discounted options would have had a nominal, face value haircut of 33. Some bondholders had favoured the use of so-called state-contingent debt instruments, which could increase payouts if Ghanas economy performs better on agreed metrics, as a way of bridging differences in their outlook.

        "date": "April 16, 2024 10:14 am",
        "content": "Chinas economy in the first quarter grew faster than expected, official data released Tuesday by Chinas National Bureau of Statistics showed. Gross domestic product in the January to March period grew 5.3 compared to a year ago  faster than the 5.2 expansion in the fourth quarter of 2023 and 4.6 growth expected by economists polled by Reuters. On a quarter-on-quarter basis, Chinas GDP grew 1.6 in the first quarter, compared to a Reuters poll expectations of 1.4 and a revised fourth quarter expansion of 1.2. Beijing has set a 2024 growth target of around 5. Growth was driven in part by external demand, as export volume grew by 14 year on year, said Zhiwei Zhang, president and chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management. The strong first quarter growth will make the government comfortable with its current policy stance, he said in a note on Tuesday. With the Fed rate cut probability declining, I think the chance of rate cut by Peoples Bank of China is also diminishing, he added. He noted that the PBOC on Tuesday set the fixing rate for the Chinese yuan against the U.S. dollar at 7.1028, weaker than the 7.0979 on Monday, which indicates the government may be willing to tolerate more flexibility in the exchange rate. A weak currency makes a countrys exports less expensive and more desirable. Following the data release, the offshore yuan strengthened slightly, before retreating from its five-month high seen early Tuesday to trade at 7.2724 against the greenback. Industrial output for March grew 4.5 year on year, missing expectations of 6. Retail sales grew 3.1 year on year, lower than expectations of 4.6. The weaker-than-expected growth of industrial output in March is associated with the sluggish utilization rate of industrial capacity, while the slowing down of retail sales was unsurprising, said Bruce Pang, chief economist and head of research for Greater China at investment management and real estate firm JLL. We expect the policy push of equipment investment, as well as product renewal and replacement could continue to provide a temporary boost to domestic demand and keep the annual GDP target of around 5 achievable, he highlighted. Unemployment in major cities inched down to 5.2, snapping a three-month streak of increases. Last week, Morgan Stanley raised its 2024 real GDP forecast for China to 4.8, from its previous expectation of 4.2. The worlds second largest economy saw weak export and inflation data earlier this month, with both sets of data coming in below expectations. Real estate remains weak Chinas embattled real estate sector continued to show weakness, with property investments falling 9.5 year on year in the first quarter. Floor space of new commercial buildings sold was 226.68 million square meters, plunging 19.4 year on year. During the first three months of the year, former property giants Evergrande was ordered to liquidate and Country Garden Holdings faced a liquidation petition. China Vanke most recently said in a meeting with analysts that it faces operational difficulties and short-term liquidity pressures. The Hang Seng Mainland Property Index has plunged 19 year-to-date, and almost 50 in the last 12 months. The data showed that while the expansion in Chinas economy was faster than forecast, it is at an unbalanced pace, Pang said. Optimism will likely be tempered by muted domestic demand, which will serve as the major weak point, he added. Source: CNBC -Agencies",

        "title": "Sydney church stabbing declared a terrorist attack; 16-year-old under arrest",
        "date": "April 16, 2024 12:33 pm",
        "content": "Australian police have declared Mondays stabbing at a Sydney church a religiously motivated terrorist act. A 16-year-old boy was arrested after a bishop, a priest and churchgoers were attacked during mass at the Assyrian Christ The Good Shepherd Church. At least four people suffered non-life-threatening injuries, police say. The attacker was also hurt. The incident was captured on a church livestream and quickly triggered unrest in the suburb of Wakeley. Australian police define terror offences as being ideologically motivated. Investigations are still under way, but they say they are satisfied this is a case of religious extremism. Authorities have repeatedly declined to state the religion of the alleged attacker. Graphic videos of the attack - and the aftermath - spread like wildfire on social media on Monday night, drawing an angry crowd to the Assyrian Orthodox Church, which is about 35km south-west of the city centre. There the crowd - hundreds of people - violently clashed with police, who were guarding the church where the attacker was being treated by paramedics. Two officers were injured, one with a broken jaw after he was hit with a brick and fence palings, and 10 police cars destroyed. The violence similarly left paramedics fearing for their safety and holed up inside the church for more than three hours. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has convened an emergency meeting of national security agencies, calling the attack disturbing. Were a peace-loving nation... Theres no place for violent extremism. Tying to quell further violence, he urged that people not take the law into their own hands. Speaking to media on Tuesday morning, New South Wales (NSW) Police Commissioner Karen Webb said the bishop and priest were undergoing surgery and were lucky to be alive. The church has named the priest as Father Isaac Royel and the bishop as Mar Mari Emmanuel. Ordained in 2011, Bishop Emmanuel is seen as a popular and controversial figure, and his sermons have received millions of views on social media. Ms Webb said the teenager allegedly made comments to the bishop as he approached, which were centred around religion, and police believe staging the attack during a livestreamed service was intended to be intimidating not only to the parishioners in attendance, but those parishioners who were watching online. She said the suspect was acting alone, and while known to police, he was not on any terror watch list. The alleged offender has also been in surgery after his fingers were injured, police said, adding it is unclear if he was hurt with his own weapon or when he was apprehended by the congregation. The incident came only days after the nation was shocked by a separate and unrelated stabbing at a popular Sydney shopping centre, which left seven people dead. NSW is on edge and theres understandable community anxiety at the moment, said state premier Chris Minns. He appealed for calm, echoing calls from religious and community leaders. Their message to their communities was universal and identical, and that is that they deplore violence in all forms, and that they have faith in the NSW Police to undertake their investigation, Mr Minns said. Any attempt for tit-for-tat violence would by met by the full force of the law, he added. A strike force has also been assembled to find those involved in the riot, Ms Webb said: We will find you and we will come and arrest you. The head of the NSW Ambulance also called the behaviour from crowds outrageous. Our people, that do nothing but go to care and help every single day, need to know that theyve got the support of the community, Dominic Morgan said. The Wakeley neighbourhood is a hub for Sydneys small Christian Assyrian community, many of whom have fled persecution and war in Iraq and Syria. Bishop Emmanuel is a prominent leader in that community, and is one of the kindest, most authentic, genuine human beings, local MP Dai Le said. However the bishop has had a turbulent relationship with the Assyrian Church, reportedly being suspended for disobeying canons and forming a breakaway church. In 2021 he became a vocal opponent of Covid-19 restrictions, describing lockdowns in Australia as slavery and arguing that vaccines were futile. Source: BBC -Agencies",

        "date": "April 16, 2024 03:16 pm",
        "content": "The government of Sri Lanka has concluded the initial restricted discussions with nine members of the Steering Committee of the Ad Hoc Group of Bondholders regarding its international sovereign bonds (ISBs). During the discussions, which spanned over the past three weeks (Restricted Period), Sri Lanka was joined by its legal and financial advisors Clifford Chance and Lazard, respectively, while the restricted members of the Steering Committee were joined by the Groups legal and financial advisors, White  Case and Rothschild  Co., respectively. The Steering Committee as a whole comprises ten of the largest members of the Group, with the Group controlling approximately 50 of the aggregate outstanding amount of ISBs. In a statement, Sri Lankas Finance Ministry said that the parties failed to come to an agreement on restructuring terms, despite the constructive discussions. Bloomberg said the failure to arrive at a deal puts pressure on Sri Lankan authorities who need to make progress on debt restructuring to keep funds flowing from the IMF. Further, the Steering Committee has not agreed to an extension of the restricted discussions upon expiration of the current Restricted Period, according to the statement. During this period, Sri Lanka, the Steering Committee and its advisors met during a two-day working session in London on 27 and 28 March to discuss the Groups latest debt treatment proposal. Prior to the meetings, on 25 March, Sri Lanka had also sent its own debt treatment proposal to the Groups advisors which was rejected by the Steering Committee. Prior to the meetings, staff at the IMF had provided their preliminary and informal assessment of both parties proposals consistency with Sri Lankas IMF-supported program parameters and debt sustainability objectives. The IMF staff assessment included an analysis of the sum total of restructuring proposals (for official and private creditors) based on agreed deals with certain creditors and the Sri Lankan authorities restructuring scenario for other creditors. On that basis, the IMF staff concluded that the debt treatment scenario included in Sri Lankas proposal was consistent with the IMF-supported program debt sustainability targets, while the scenario included in the Groups March proposal was not. IMF staff noted that these were preliminary assessments and the IMF staff would provide final assessments only after the parties had reached a tentative agreement in principle. During the Meetings, it was agreed that the primary basis for the discussions would be the Groups March proposal. Sri Lanka articulated the main reservations it had in relation to the Groups proposed Macro-Linked Bond (MLB) - while members of the Steering Committee articulated the reasons why they believed the terms of their MLB proposal were fair and reasonable. The Finance Ministry said the Sri Lankan government looks forward to continued engagement and to reach a common ground in the next few weeks, ahead of the review of the IMF-supported program by the Executive Board. The global lender has yet to assess the Groups revised debt treatment proposal submitted by the bondholders on 3 April. Sri Lanka Concludes Initial... by Adaderana Online",

Some of those killed were farmers struck by lightning while harvesting wheat, authorities said. Images online show swathes of farmland engulfed by rainwater. Flash floods have also disrupted power supplies and transportation networks. Pakistan has experienced an increase in extreme weather events, as it grapples with the impacts of climate change. In 2022, parts of the country were completely submerged by unprecedented flooding, killing more than 1,700 people and injuring thousands. Millions were left homeless and lacked clean drinking water for months after. Some of the areas affected by the 2022 floods, including Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan, are being impacted again by the recent storms. With more rain expected in the coming days, Pakistans National Disaster Management Authority has also warned of landslides and flash floods. Pakistans most populated province Punjab has suffered the highest death toll so far, with 21 people killed by lightning between Friday and Sunday, AFP news agency reported. At least eight were killed in the westernmost Balochistan province according to AFP, where authorities have declared a state of emergency. Schools in the province were ordered to shut on Monday and Tuesday. Extensive areas of Pasni, a Baloch coastal town, have been covered by rainwater. Pasni looks like a big lake at the moment as flash floods entered the human settlements and main commercial areas, Noor Ahmed Kalmati, chairman of the towns municipal committee, told Pakistan newspaper Dawn. Heavy flooding has also been reported in neighbouring Afghanistan. At least 33 people have been killed and hundreds of homes damaged or destroyed, Afghan authorities said on Sunday. Scientists have said that global warming is likely to have played a role in the devastating floods that hit Pakistan in 2022. Pakistan is also ranked as the fifth most vulnerable country to climate change, according to the UNs Global Climate Risk Index. Source: BBC -Agencies",

        "date": "April 16, 2024 10:52 pm",
        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe visited the Court Lodge Estate, owned by the Udupusellawa Plantation Company in Nuwara Eliya this morning (16) to explore opportunities for the revival of the tourism industry around the picturesque hills of Nuwara Eliya. He embarked on this journey by traversing the Pekoe Trail. The Pekoe Trail stretches over more than 300km through the Central Highlands of Sri Lanka, regarded as one of Asias best-kept secret routes. Originating from the renowned city of Kandy, it extends south towards the Hatton and Horton Plains National Park, then east through Haputale and Ella, before meandering around the charming town of Nuwara Eliya. Originally constructed during the British colonial period to transport tea from vast plantations to factories, the trail holds historical significance. During his walk along the Pekoe Trail, covering a distance of 3.2km, the President engaged in friendly conversation with the workers employed at the Court Lodge estate. The Court Lodge estate, overseen by Browns Plantations, spans over 264 hectares and employs a total of 349 workers. The factory at Court Lodge is known for producing Light Bright tea. During his visit, Wickremesinghe personally inspected the fundamental requirements of the plantation workers, addressing issues related to education, healthcare and housing. He particularly focused on the prospects of the children within the plantation workers community, especially those set to complete their schooling after the G.C.E. Advanced level examination. During his tour, Wickremesinghe also emphasized the importance of providing Pekoe Trail tourists with the opportunity to savour a freshly brewed cup of tea. Furthermore, he explored avenues to bolster the tourism industry associated with Sri Lankas central highlands by leveraging the Pekoe Trail. Mr. Miguel Cunat, the visionary behind the Pekoe Trail expedition, who has extensively explored the central mountains of Sri Lanka over the years, expressed his belief that Sri Lanka could be mapped internationally as one of the premier hiking destinations globally. Pekoe Trail offers tourists a unique opportunity to explore a variety of terrains, delve into the regions storied history, engage with its vibrant culture and savour authentic local cuisine and beverages. Comprising 22 stages, the Pekoe Trail can be tailored to suit one-day or multi-day excursions, catering to a range of preferences. Plans are underway to further develop the trail, enhancing it with necessary facilities to ensure a seamless and enjoyable experience for visitors. The European Union (EU) and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) have extended their support to the Pekoe Trail project, aligning with Sri Lankas national tourism strategies. The initiative encompasses various aspects, including sustainable environmental development, to foster the growth of tourism in the country. The goal of the Pekoe Trail project is to draw in a new wave of tourism, including adventure seekers, to Sri Lanka while simultaneously improving the livelihoods of rural communities. Mr. Miguel Cunat conveyed his appreciation to the President for the support provided in initiating the Pekoe Trail and commended the Presidents vision to revitalize the countrys economy by transforming the tourism industry.",

        "date": "April 17, 2024 09:34 am",
        "content": "The British governments plan for a landmark smoking ban that aims to stop young people from ever smoking cleared its first hurdle in Parliament on Tuesday despite vocal opposition from within Prime Minister Rishi Sunaks Conservative Party. The bill, a key policy announced by Sunak last year, would make it illegal to sell tobacco products to anyone born after January 1, 2009. If passed, the bill will give Britain some of the toughest anti-smoking measures in the world. Authorities say it will create modern Britains first smoke-free generation. Under the Tobacco and Vapes Bill, children turning 15 this year or younger will never be legally sold tobacco. Once implemented  officials are aiming for 2027  the legal age of sale that people in England can buy cigarettes will be raised by one year, every year until it is eventually illegal for the whole population. The bill also includes measures to crack down on youth vaping, such as banning the sale of cheap disposable vapes and restricting their flavors to prevent children from becoming addicted to nicotine. It is currently illegal for anyone to sell cigarettes or tobacco products and vapes to people under 18 years old throughout the U.K. Lawmakers voted 383 to 67 to give the bill a second reading late Tuesday after an afternoon of debate. Although the bill was widely praised by health experts and had the support of the opposition Labour Party, Sunak faced rebellion from more libertarian-minded members of his party, who criticized the proposals as unconservative. Conservative lawmakers were granted a free vote, meaning they could vote with their personal conscience rather than follow the official party line. Opponents, such as the smokers rights lobbying group FOREST, said the move risks creating a black market and will treat future generations of adults like kids. Prominent voices within the Conservative Party, including two of Sunaks predecessors Boris Johnson and Liz Truss, said the plans went against conservative values by limiting peoples personal freedoms. The bill was a virtue-signaling piece of legislation about protecting adults from themselves in the future, Truss told Parliament during Tuesdays debate. Other high-profile Tories, including business secretary Kemi Badenoch, a Cabinet minister, also opposed the bill. The plans were believed to have been inspired by similar policies proposed by New Zealand under former Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, but the countrys new coalition government repealed the bill earlier this year. The government said that smoking wont be criminalized, and the phased changes mean that anyone who can legally buy cigarettes now wont be prevented from doing so in the future. The number of people who smoke in the U.K. has declined by two-thirds since the 1970s, but some 6.4 million people in the country  or about 13 of the population  still smoke, according to official figures. Authorities say smoking causes some 80,000 deaths a year in the U.K, and remains the number one preventable cause of death, disability and poor health. Source: Associated Press -Agencies",

        "date": "April 17, 2024 02:37 pm",
        "content": "U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen on Tuesday warned that the U.S. intends to hit Iran with new sanctions in coming days over its unprecedented attack on Israel, and these actions could seek to reduce Irans capacity to export oil. With respect to sanctions, I fully expect that we will take additional sanctions action against Iran in the coming days, Yellen said told a news conference on the sidelines of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank spring meetings in Washington. We dont preview our sanctions tools. But in discussions Ive had, all options to disrupt terrorist financing of Iran continue to be on the table, Yellen added. She said that the Treasury and State Department have taken previous action to contain Irans destabilizing behavior by diminishing its ability to export oil. Clearly, Iran is continuing to export some oil. There may be more that we could do. I dont want to preview our actual sanctions activities, but certainly that remains in focus as a possible area that we could address. Treasury was working to enlist the aid of China, G7 partners and other major global suppliers to erode Irans ability to continue to export oil and to get the microelectronics needed for the drones it used to attack Israel and was selling to Russia, a senior Treasury official told reporters. The official said a jump in oil prices had been driven mainly by geopolitical uncertainty, not U.S. sanctions, and noted that past sanctions had not led to oil price increases. Were going to have conversations with all major suppliers around the world. That includes countries in the G7; that includes China. All of these countries have to play a role in constraining Irans ability to get access to the goods they are using to build weapons, the official said. In prepared remarks, Yellen said Irans attack on Israel last weekend and its financing of militant groups in Gaza, Lebanon, Yemen and Iraq threatened stability in the Middle East and could cause economic spillovers. The United States is using financial sanctions to isolate Iran and disrupt its ability to fund proxy groups and support Russias war in Ukraine, Yellen said. Treasury has targeted more than 500 individuals and entities connected to terrorism and terrorist financing by the Iranian regime and its proxies since the start of the Biden administration in January 2021, Yellen said. That has included targeting Irans drone and missile programs and its financing of the Palestinian militant group Hamas, the Houthis in Yemen, Hezbollah in Lebanon, and Iraqi militia groups, she said. From this weekends attack to the Houthi attacks in the Red Sea, Irans actions threaten the regions stability and could cause economic spillovers, Yellen said, without giving details. Iran on Saturday launched more than 300 drones and missiles against Israel, its first direct attack on the country, in retaliation for a suspected Israeli air strike on its embassy compound in Damascus on April 11 that killed elite military officers. Israels military said that it shot down almost all the drones and missiles, and that the attack caused no deaths, but the situation has increased fears of open warfare between the longtime foes. In Gaza, more than 33,000 Palestinians have been killed in the Israeli offensive launched against Hamas after the group attacked Israel on Oct. 7, killing 1,200 people and taking 253 hostages, according to Israeli tallies. Yellen said Washington was continuing to use economic tools to pressure Hamas, but said Treasury was emphasizing that its sanctions should not impede life-saving aid. She called for urgent action to end Palestinian suffering in the narrow enclave, noting that Gazas entire population of more than 2 million people was facing acute food insecurity and that most of the population had been displaced. It is incumbent on all of us here at these meetings to do everything in our power to end this suffering, she said. Yellen noted that Washington was also using sanctions to target extreme settler violence in the West Bank, while working to ensure a functioning banking system there and supporting IMF programs in Jordan and Egypt.

        "date": "April 17, 2024 06:00 pm",
        "content": "The Government of Sri Lanka says it hopes to continue discussions with the bondholders with a view to reaching common ground ahead of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) board consideration of the second review of Sri Lankas Extended Fund Facility (EFF) program. The Finance Ministry, yesterday, issued a statement announcing that the government has concluded the initial restricted discussions with nine members of the Steering Committee of the Ad Hoc Group of Bondholders regarding its international sovereign bonds (ISBs). The Steering Committee as a whole comprises ten of the largest members of the Group, with the Group controlling approximately 50 of the aggregate outstanding amount of ISBs. In its statement, Sri Lankas Finance Ministry said that the parties failed to come to an agreement on restructuring terms, despite the constructive discussions. Bloomberg reported the failure to arrive at a deal puts pressure on Sri Lankan authorities who need to make progress on debt restructuring to keep funds flowing from the IMF. Further, the statement elucidated that the Steering Committee had not agreed to an extension of the restricted discussions upon expiration of the current Restricted Period. However, issuing a statement on Wednesday (17), State Minister of Finance Sheahn Semasinghe clarified that Sri Lankan authorities continue to engage all debt restructuring negotiations in good faith, within principles of equitable treatment among creditors, and with maximum transparency within the norms of such negotiations. He said it is standard practice when a representative group of bondholders is formed, to entertain confidential discussions with such group and its appointed advisors. In the case of Sri Lanka, the Ad Hoc Group of Bondholders represents holders controlling more than 50 of the bonds, which make them a privileged interlocutor for Sri Lanka, he said. The State Minister added: It is well understood that given the price sensitive nature of the negotiations, and according to market regulations, discussions with the Group and its advisors are to be conducted under non-disclosure agreements. This evidently restricts the ability of the Government to unilaterally report about the substance of the discussions. The cleansing statement, which was issued on the 16th of April, at the conclusion of this first round of confidential discussions with members of the Group, aims at informing the Sri Lankan people, market participants and other stakeholders to this debt restructuring exercise, about the progress in negotiations. It provides the highest possible level of transparency within the internationally accepted practices in such circumstances. As informed in this statement, confidential discussions held in recent weeks with bondholders representatives proved constructive, building on the restructuring proposals presented by both parties. During the talks both sides successfully bridged a number of technical issues enabling important progress to be made. Sri Lanka articulated key remaining concerns that need to be addressed in a satisfactory manner. The next steps would entail further consultation with the IMF staff regarding assessments of the compatibility of the latest proposals with program parameters. Following these consultations, we hope to continue discussions with the bondholders with a view to reaching common ground ahead of the IMF board consideration of the second review of Sri Lankas EFF program.",

        "date": "April 17, 2024 08:58 pm",
        "content": "Sri Lanka may reach a deal with investors to restructure its 12 billion in defaulted global bonds by mid-May, according to strategists at Standard Chartered. The South Asian nation has been hoping to reach a deal in the next few weeks, though the first round of direct talks with dollar bondholders failed to yield a breakthrough. The remaining disagreements relate to the structure of macro-linked bonds, an instrument proposed by bondholders, whose payout would vary depending on the nations economic performance. We think timelines are critical and expect an agreement by mid-May, strategists including Shankar Narayanaswamy wrote in a note. Further delays would take the talks too close to the planned presidential elections, Standard Chartered said. The nations dollar bonds were among top performers on Wednesday, with the March 2029 note advancing 2 cents to 56.4 cents per dollar. Bonds maturing in March 2030 and April 2028 also climbed. IMF Talks With bonds currently trading close to our current probability-adjusted recovery value under the governments proposal at 11 exit yields, we see possible upside to the bonds, the strategists wrote. At an exit yield of 11, investors would stand to recover 56.1 cents on the dollar under the governments proposal, and 68.3 cents under the bondholder committees plan, Standard Chartered said. The overall recovery value will probably end up somewhere between those two figures, it said. The government will hold further consultations with International Monetary Fund staff on the latest proposals, said junior finance minister Shehan Semasinghe, whos leading Sri Lankas delegation at the Spring Meetings in Washington. Subsequently, local authorities hope to continue discussions with the bondholders with a view to reaching common ground ahead of the IMF board consideration of the second review of Sri Lankas EFF program Semasinghe said in a statement. A deal with private investors is among the last steps in Sri Lankas plan to overhaul 27 billion of foreign debt, including bonds and loans. The restructuring is critical to ensure financing from the nations 3 billion IMF bailout keeps flowing. The government has already struck deals with official creditors, including China, India and the Paris Club as well as with holders of its local debt. Ukraine has been another nation with distressed debt to use GDP-linked warrants. Source: Bloomberg -Agencies",

        "content": "Chamari Athapaththu smashed the third-highest individual score in womens ODIs to help Sri Lanka pull off the highest-ever successful run-chase in womens ODIs. Chamari Athapaththu was at her brutal best as Sri Lanka stunned South Africa with a record run-chase in Potchefstroom to level the three-match ICC Womens Championship ODI series and end a highly successful bilateral tour to the Rainbow Nation. Chasing 302 to win, Athapaththu led Sri Lankas fightback with a stunning hundred, and remained unbeaten on 195, the third-highest score in womens ODIs, as the visitors overhauled the target with 33 balls to spare. Athapaththus innings was also the second highest individual score in a successful run chase in ODI cricket - both mens and womens - marginally behind the magnificent 201 Glenn Maxwell put together for Australia against Afghanistan at last years ICC Mens Cricket World Cup. Earlier, Laura Wolvaardt continued her stellar run in the bilateral series against Sri Lanka with a second ODI hundred in as many matches. The opener smashed an unbeaten 184 to take South Africa to 301 in the third and final ODI of the series. Wolvaardts knock is the highest score by a South African in womens ODIs and was also the fourth-highest in womens ODIs for a brief while, going past Athapaththus 178 against Australia in 2017. Wolvaardt, who had made a hundred in the T20I leg of the tour, also smashed a century in the second ODI in Kimberley on Saturday. On Wednesday, she added another ton to her tally with a spectacular knock. But her brilliance was overshadowed by her opposite number, Athapaththu, who stole the limelight with a stunning hundred to seal the first-ever successful run-chase of over 300 in womens ODIs. Australia had held the record for the highest run-chase in womens ODIs for more than a decade. In 2012, Australia chased down a target of 289 against New Zealand. Last year, they also chased down 283 against India at the Wankhede. Source: ICC",

        "content": "Indonesian authorities issued a tsunami alert Wednesday after eruptions at Ruang mountain sent ash thousands of feet high. Officials ordered more than 11,000 people to leave the area. The volcano on the northern side of Sulawesi island had at least five large eruptions in the past 24 hours, Indonesias Center for Volcanology and Geological Disaster Mitigation said. Authorities raised their volcano alert to its highest level. At least 800 residents left the area earlier Wednesday. Indonesia, an archipelago of 270 million people, has 120 active volcanoes. It is prone to volcanic activity because it sits along the Ring of Fire, a horseshoe-shaped series of seismic fault lines around the Pacific Ocean. Authorities urged tourists and others to stay at least 6 kilometers (3.7 miles) from the 725-meter (2,378 foot) Ruang volcano. Officials worry that part of the volcano could collapse into the sea and cause a tsunami as in a 1871 eruption there. Tagulandang island to the volcanos northeast is again at risk, and its residents are among those being told to evacuate. Indonesias National Disaster Mitigation Agency said residents will be relocated to Manado, the nearest city, on Sulawesi island, a journey of six hours by boat. In 2018, the eruption of Indonesias Anak Krakatau volcano caused a tsunami along the coasts of Sumatra and Java after parts of the mountain fell into the ocean, killing 430 people.

Out of the 56 Sri Lankans who were trapped in cybercrime camps in Myawaddy, eight were rescued by the Myanmar government authorities in early March and sent to the Myawaddy central police station, following which they safely arrived at the Embassy of Sri Lanka in Thailand on April 11. The International Organization for Migration provided logistical assistance in repatriating the rescued Sri Lankans. The Sri Lankan Embassy in Myanmar, through the Eden Foundation, a charity organization based in Myanmar, provided them with food and other necessities during their temporary stay at the Myawaddy Police Station following the rescue from traffickers.

        "content": "NASA has selected a new crew of four volunteers to participate in a simulated mission to Mars within a habitat at the agencys Johnson Space Center in Houston. Jason Lee, Stephanie Navarro, Shareef Al Romaithi, and Piyumi Wijesekara will step into the agencys Human Exploration Research Analog, or HERA, on Friday, May 10. Once inside, the team will live and work like astronauts for 45 days. The crew will exit the facility on June 24 after they return to Earth. Jose Baca and Brandon Kent are this missions alternate crew members. HERA enables scientists to study how crew members adapt to isolation, confinement, and remote conditions before NASA sends astronauts on deep space missions to the Moon, Mars, and beyond. Crew members will carry out scientific research and operational tasks throughout their simulated mission to the Red Planet, including a walk on Marss surface using virtual reality. They will also experience increasing communication delays lasting up to five minutes each way with Mission Control Center as they near Mars. This crew is the second group of volunteers to participate in a simulated Mars mission in HERA this year. The most recent crew completed its HERA mission on March 18. Two other missions will follow this year, with the final HERA crew slated to wrap up on Dec. 20. In a first for HERA, one crew member, Shareef Al Romaithi, hails from the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and will participate in the mission through a partnership between NASA and the UAEs Mohammed Bin Rashid Space Centre (MBRSC). As with the previous HERA mission this year, NASAs Human Research Program is conducting 18 human health studies during the mission. The experiments will evaluate the physiological, behavioral, and psychological responses of crew members in an environment similar to what astronauts will face on a trip to Mars. Seven of these studies are collaborations with the MBRSC and the European Space Agency (ESA). Insights gleaned from the studies will allow researchers to develop and test strategies aimed at helping astronauts overcome obstacles on long missions deep into space.

        "date": "April 18, 2024 12:02 pm",
        "content": "The Criminal Investigations Department (CID) has arrested a retired Major of the Sri Lanka Army and another person for fraudulently obtaining money from individuals on the promise of sending them for employment in the Russian army, police said. However, on April 01, the Ministry of Defence announced that all members of Sri Lankan tri-forces have been informed not to join Russian or Ukrainian forces by any illegal means. The Ministry of Defense also mentioned that against a background where there is no agreement between the Sri Lankan army and the Russian army to send Sri Lankan military members to serve in Russia, such incidents will damage the reputation of the country. Meanwhile in December 2023, it was reported that three Sri Lankan mercenaries were killed in Russian attack while serving in Ukrainian military. Nevertheless, a report published on Al Jazeera news service which quoted several Sri Lankans living in Russia, highlighted that hundreds of Sri Lankans are now serving with the Russian military in Ukraine, most lured into combat by Russias offer of salaries up to 3,000 a month and the prospect of Russian citizenship. Many more  mostly retired Sri Lankan soldiers  are also desperately trying to join the Russian army, willing to risk death at the hands of Ukrainian forces in exchange for Moscows money amid dire poverty at home in Sri Lanka, it added.",

        "date": "April 18, 2024 12:33 pm",
        "content": "The International Monetary Fund (IMF) stands ready to support Sri Lankas discussions with international bondholders and will provide a formal assessment after the parties reach a tentative agreement-in-principle, an IMF spokesperson said on Thursday. We hope an agreement consistent with the parameters of the IMF-supported program and official creditors Comparability of Treatment requirements can be reached soon, ahead of completing the second review under the program, the spokesperson said. Sri Lanka said it failed to reach an agreement with bondholders to restructure about 12 billion debt earlier this week, raising concerns there could be a delay in the island nation receiving a third tranche of its 2.9 billion IMF program in June. The government said one of the main stumbling blocks had been that the baseline parameters of the bondholders plan had not matched those embedded in its IMF program. We encourage both parties to continue their discussions swiftly, the IMF statement added. Sri Lanka will consult with the IMF to assess if the latest proposals discussed with bondholders were within the parameters of its bailout program. The island nation defaulted on its foreign debt in May 2022 and kicked off negotiations with bilateral creditors several months later, eventually securing an agreement in principle with China, India and the Paris Club last November. Sri Lanka plunged into its worst financial crisis since independence from the British in 1948 after its foreign exchange reserves fell to record lows in early 2022, leaving it unable to pay for essentials including fuel, cooking gas, and medicine.

        "title": "Ukraine warns of WW3 ahead of long-stalled Congress aid vote",
        "date": "April 18, 2024 02:41 pm",
        "content": "Ukraines prime minister has told the BBC there will be a Third World War if Ukraine loses its conflict with Russia, as he urged the US Congress to pass a long-stalled foreign aid bill. Denys Shmyhal expressed careful optimism that US lawmakers would pass the hotly contested measure, which has 61bn (49bn) earmarked for Kyiv. The House of Representatives is set to vote on the package this Saturday. The proposal includes funding for Israel as well as the Indo-Pacific. Speaking to the BBC in Washington DC on Wednesday, Prime Minister Shmyhal said of the US security assistance: We need this money yesterday, not tomorrow, not today. If we will not protect... Ukraine will fall, he added. So the global, the global system of security will be destroyed... and all the world will need to find... a new system of security. Or, there will be many conflicts, many such kinds of wars, and in the end of the day, it could lead to the Third World War. This is not the first time Ukraine has issued such an alarming warning about the consequences of its potential defeat. Last year, President Volodymyr Zelensky said that if Russia won the conflict, it could next invade Poland, triggering World War Three. But Kremlin officials have ridiculed such claims as Western scaremongering. Last month President Vladimir Putin dismissed suggestions that Russia might one day attack Eastern Europe as complete nonsense. Russia has never attacked a country within Nato, which includes Poland. Natos collective defence pact means that an attack on one member constitutes an attack on all. In Wednesdays interview, Prime Minister Shmyhal was asked about a recent claim by Republican House Foreign Affairs Chairman Michael McCaul that members of his own party were being infected by Russian propaganda. Mr Shmyhal said: We should understand that disinformation and propaganda is influencing here in the United States on many people, in European Union on many people, such as in Ukraine. Opposition from the right wing of the Republican party has blocked potential assistance to Ukraine for months. Some of those lawmakers have objected to sending tens of billions of dollars in aid overseas, without first passing funds for US-Mexico border security. These conservatives have also dismissed as smears any suggestion that they could be Kremlin dupes. President Joe Biden said in a statement on Wednesday he would sign the package into law immediately once passed by Congress to send a message to the world: We stand with our friends. Ukraine is critically dependent on weapon supplies from the US and the West to keep fighting Russia, which has superior numbers and an abundance of artillery ammunition. Months of congressional impasse have already had profound effects on the battlefield. Ukraine has found itself outmanned and outgunned and forced into retreat because of ammunition rationing and falling morale. In February, it retreated from Avdiivka, a town near occupied Donetsk that it had held since the conflict began in 2014. Oleksandr Tarnavskyi, a general overseeing the withdrawal, cited a 10-to-one artillery ammunition advantage for his enemies and said pulling back after months of fighting was the only correct solution. President Zelensky blamed an artificial deficit of weapons as he made urgent appeals for more military aid to avoid a catastrophic situation. President Biden has cited dwindling supplies as a result of congressional inaction as a reason for the retreat. Avdiivkas loss was the heaviest for Ukraine since its troops pulled out of Bakhmut in May 2023. Both came after months of attritional warfare in which Russian forces levelled buildings with massed artillery and poured waves of troops into the frontline. General Sir Richard Barrons, a former commander of the UKs Joint Forces Command, recently stated he feared that Ukraine could face defeat this year unless it was given the weapons and ammunition it needed to secure its lines. We are seeing Russia batter away at the front line, employing a five-to-one advantage in artillery, ammunition, and a surplus of people, he said. Ukraine may come to feel it cant win. And when it gets to that point, why will people want to fight and die? Both sides have suffered heavy losses in the battles but mounting casualties have left Ukraine, unlike Russia, with a shortage of manpower. The government earlier this month lowered the age of conscription from 27 to 25 in an effort to raise hundreds of thousands of new recruits. President Zelensky has said 31,000 Ukrainian soldiers have been killed since 2022. US officials, however, believe at least 70,000 have died and many more are injured. A BBC investigation calculates that at least 50,000 Russian troops have been killed. Tens of thousands are believed to have been injured. Russia has transformed its industrial base into a wartime economy - spending 40 of its national budget on armaments while striking deals with Iran and North Korea for ammunition, missiles and drones.

        "date": "April 18, 2024 04:42 pm",
        "content": "Two scientists whose connection was sparked in Saskatchewan are working together from different sides of the globe to improve animal health in Sri Lanka, in hopes of addressing a potential global health threat. Literally right here is where we sat together, said Joe Rubin, looking around his lab at the University of Saskatchewan, Canada. Its the scene where an international friendship formed on the Prairies. Rubin is a professor of veterinary microbiology at the Western College of Veterinary Medicine in Saskatoon. He met fellow scientist Roshan Madalagama almost 11 years ago, when Madalagama came to Saskatchewan from Sri Lanka as a graduate student. I believe that my second home is in Canada, Madalagama told CBC from Peradeniya, Sri Lanka. As a mentor, Rubin is one of the greatest people Ive ever met in my life. Theres no doubt about that. Rubin supervised Madalagama as the two studied antimicrobial resistance, or AMR  the same issue theyre tackling today. Only now, its Madalagama taking the lead. As a supervisor, there is nothing as gratifying as when your student kind of surpasses you, Rubin said with a laugh. Dr. Madalagama has gone on to do really amazing things. Hes been a really inspirational person in his country. AMR a major global threat: WHO Antimicrobial resistance is what happens when bacteria, fungus and parasites build up resistance to medication like antibiotics, making infections harder to treat and some procedures riskier. It can happen due to the overuse or misuse of those medications. The World Health Organization deems AMR a major global threat, and the rates are especially high in Sri Lanka. Up until last year, Madalagama said his country didnt monitor that resistance in animals  only humans. The immediate worry is if it goes unchecked, vets in Sri Lanka wont be able to treat illnesses in livestock  which many families depend on for income or food for their own families. Theyre really relying on it for their nutrition, so its not the bigger-scale agriculture that we may be familiar with here in Saskatchewan, said Rubin. Madalagama says until last year, Sri Lanka only monitored antimicrobial resistance in humans, not animals. He hopes to create a national system to keep track of the resistance in animals, especially livestock. (Submitted by Joe Rubin) The overarching concern, however, is that resistance seen in animals could transfer to humans anywhere. All the world is like one village  a global village, said Madalagama. So because of that, we need to have a very collective effort. Madalagama has helped the WHO and Sri Lankas government address antimicrobial resistance from a veterinary standpoint, but now he and Rubin are focusing on more grassroots work. Thanks to funding from the University of Saskatchewan, the two started a years-long effort to help rural vets in Sri Lanka detect issues faster, and improve training at the countrys national veterinary lab. Their first endeavour was to create a lab manual, accessible from anywhere in the world. Rubin visited Sri Lanka in March, and plans on welcoming two vet technicians to Saskatoon this fall. Madalagama said hes excited his colleagues can learn from Rubin, just as he did. They really like to have these kinds of very good opportunities to learn from a Canadian expert, he said. He changed my life. Source: CBC --Agencies",

        "title": "Sri Lankan govt reveals shortlisted bidders for key SOEs; transactions to end by August",
        "date": "April 18, 2024 04:51 pm",
        "content": "The State-Owned Enterprise Restructuring Unit (SRU) of the Finance Ministry has officially released the names of the local and foreign firms that have submitted responses to the respective requests for quote and the shortlisted bidders for the divestiture of shares held by the Government of Sri Lanka in several key state-owned enterprises (SOEs). Issuing a press release, the SRU also said that it is envisaged that all SOE transactions other than SriLankan Airlines will be concluded by August 2024 and that the timeline for SriLankan Airlines is likely to extend to end of September 2024. In March 2023, the Cabinet of Ministers granted in-principle approval for the divestiture of shares held by the Government of Sri Lanka in Hotel Developers Lanka Ltd (HDL, owners of Hilton Colombo), Canwill Holdings Pvt Ltd (CHPL, owners of Grand Hyatt Colombo), Lanka Hospitals Corporation PLC (LHCP), Sri Lanka Telecom PLC (SLT), SriLankan Airlines Ltd (SLA), Litro Gas Lanka LtdLitro Gas Terminals (Pvt) Ltd (together LITRO), Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation Life Limited and Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation General Limited (together SLIC). Following GoSLs procurement processes, Transaction Advisors (TA) were appointed for these entities. The TAs were tasked with inter-alia, comprehensive sell-side due diligence, market sounding, valuation and document drafting. The Cabinet of Ministers approved Divestiture Guidelines that set out the framework when divesting a state-owned entity. These guidelines ensure greater transparency and accountability and provide investors the confidence of a credible process. The Cabinet of Ministers also appointed Special Project Committees (SPC) for each entity being divested together with a Special Cabinet Appointed Negotiating Committee (SpCANC). Each SPC comprising of members from both the public and private sectors was tasked with preparing the Request for Qualification (RfQ) and Request for Proposal (RfP) documents and for evaluating proposals received. The SpCANC comprising of senior public officers was tasked with validating the work of each SPC including the clearance of all RfQ and RfP documents, shortlisting bidders and making recommendations to the Cabinet of Ministers as mandated by the Divestiture Guidelines. Thereafter, GoSL acting through The Ministry of Finance, Economic Stabilization and National Policies (MoF) called for RfQs from potential investors for the divestiture of these entities, the press release said. The RfQs were advertised in both the local and international press, while industry specific publications were also used as appropriate. Further, social media platforms such as LinkedIn and WeChat were also used. Prior to the RfQs being published, the respective TAs approached both appropriate entities within the respective sectors and financial services firms, locally and internationally, to canvas the divestitures. As at date, pre-bid meetings have been held for all entities identified for divestiture. Clarifications raised at the pre-bid meetings and the responses provided were subsequently published on the website of the Treasury to ensure greater transparency. In certain instances, at the request of potential bidders and with the advice of the TAs and with approvals of the SPC and SpCANC, the RfQ closing dates were extended to foster greater competition. Such extensions were also published on the Treasury website. Deadlines for the submission of RfQs for HDL, CHPL, LHCP, SLT, SLIC and LITRO have now closed whilst for SriLankan Airlines, it remains open until 22nd April 2024, the statement said. The following table highlights those who have submitted responses to the respective RfQs. The responses received were evaluated by the respective SPC and the SpCANC and bidders were shortlisted as follows for the RfP phase.

Thereafter, the shortlisted bidders will be required to respond to a RfP and proposals received will be evaluated by the respective SPC and the SpCANC. Finally, the SpCANC will make the necessary recommendations to the Cabinet of Ministers in order to conclude each transaction. It is envisaged that all transactions other than SriLankan Airlines will be concluded by August 2024. The timeline for SriLankan airlines is likely to extend to end September 2024. In parallel to the divestiture process, work has been done to set up a structured, efficient and well governed process to manage the SOE sector going forward. This is part of the overall reform program of the government and aims to transform SOEs in to well governed, competitive and financially disciplined entities that provide citizens with essential goods and services effectively and efficiently without being a drain on public finances. An SOE Reforms Policy based on these objectives was approved by the Cabinet of Ministers in May 2023. At the heart of these reforms is the setting up of a 100 state owned Holding Company that in turn will hold all of GoSLs shares in commercial businesses. The policy includes a sound mechanism to ensure the appointment of qualified, experienced and capable persons to the boards of both the Holding Company and SOEs. Similarly, it lays down principles and policies around governance, financial discipline and disclosures which the Holding Company and all SOEs will need to adhere to. Work is currently on-going to draft a Public Commercial Businesses Act to give legal effect to these reforms. Meanwhile, many stakeholder briefings and consultations were undertaken in order to fine tune the broad SOE reform agenda and to convey information on the divestiture process. Discussions were held with leaders of the main political parties, trade unions, religious leaders and media professionals. Professional bodies such as the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka, Sri Lanka Institute of Engineers, Sri Lanka Institute of Development Administration and the Organization of Professional Associations of Sri Lanka were also briefed at sessions open to their members. The general public was kept informed through a number of television and newspaper interviews undertaken from time to time whilst inter-active sessions with youth groups were held in Colombo, Kandy, Galle, Kalutara, Matara, Kurunegala and Gampaha districts. If the underperforming, debt-ridden, Sri Lankan economy is to transition into a competitive, dynamic and prosperous environment, SOE reforms are non-negotiable. These reforms will ensure that resources are released for investment in essential but under-resourced public service obligations such as education, healthcare, energy, transportation and digitization. Without these reforms public funds will continue to be wasted on poorly managed entities that, in the first place, dont need the states involvement.",

        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe expressed his firm conviction in his ability to shape the Sri Lanka that the nations youth envision. Embracing the daunting task of revitalizing Sri Lankas faltering economy, which many deemed challenging, the President underscored his success in stabilizing the nations economic trajectory within a mere two years, the Presidents Media Division (PMD) reported. He emphasized that unity was the sole requisite for propelling the country towards progress. Addressing a gathering of young Members of Parliament and emerging political figures from the Nuwara Eliya district at the Nuwara Eliya Presidential Palace today (18), President Ranil Wickremesinghe reiterated his commitment to fostering the regions development into a premier tourist destination. Despite criticisms levelled against the governments initiatives for Nuwara Eliyas advancement, the President asserted that with widespread support, such efforts could catalyse a transformative shift in the nations economic landscape. Furthermore, President Wickremesinghe cautioned against the pitfalls of antiquated political strategies, emphasizing the imperative of concerted efforts to attract essential investments for national development. He highlighted the peoples jubilant celebration of the Sinhala and Tamil New Year under the governments sound economic policies, noting a marked increase in peoples livelihoods across various sectors. His overarching goal, he stated, was to ensure that these benefits reached every segment of society. The young parliamentarians apprised the President of the challenges they encounter and presented their proposals pertaining to the nations development agenda. In a bid to empower the youth demographic, the President outlined plans to establish regional youth centres in each divisional secretariat division. He pledged to nurture budding entrepreneurs through these centres, with intentions to engage bank executives and trade board members in the process. Mr. Ashoka Herath, the candidate for Nuwara Eliya District Member of Parliament representing the Samagi Jana Balawega, expressed his endorsement of the Presidents program despite his affiliation with another party during the event. He emphasized his backing for the program, highlighting its importance, it added. He noted that had everyone supported the Yali Pubudamu Sri Lanka program initiated in 2001 while the President was the Prime Minister and was scheduled to conclude in 2025, Sri Lanka would have already achieved developed status. He also lamented the undermining of the ongoing program aimed at transforming the country into a developed nation by 2048. Furthermore, Mr. Ashoka Herath stated his commitment to providing necessary support over the next two years to extend President Ranil Wickremesinghes leadership for another decade, facilitating a revolutionary transformation of the nation. The event also saw the participation of former Member of Parliament K.K. Piyadasa, Former Mayor of the Nuwara Eliya Municipal Council Chandana Lal Karunaratne and a group of former municipal councillors and regional youth politicians from the Nuwara Eliya district, according to the PMD.",

        "content": "DETROIT (AP)  Tesla is asking shareholders to restore a 56 billion pay package for CEO Elon Musk that was rejected by a Delaware judge this year, and to shift the companys corporate home to Texas. The changes, to be voted on by stockholders at a June 13 annual meeting, could be a tougher sell than when it was first approved in 2018. The Austin, Texas, electric vehicle maker is struggling with falling global sales, slowing electric vehicle demand, an aging model lineup and a stock price that has tumbled 37 so far this year. In January, Chancellor Kathaleen St. Jude McCormick ruled that Musk is not entitled to the landmark stock compensation that was to be granted over 10 years. Ruling on a lawsuit from a shareholder, she voided the pay package, saying that Musk essentially controlled the board, making the process of enacting the compensation unfair to stakeholders. Musk had extensive ties with the persons tasked with negotiating on Teslas behalf, she wrote in her ruling. But in a letter to shareholders released in a regulatory filing on Wednesday, Chairperson Robyn Denholm said that Musk has delivered on the growth it was looking for at the automaker, with Tesla meeting all of the stock value and operational targets in the 2018 package that was approved by shareholders. Shares are up 571 since the pay package began. Because the Delaware Court second-guessed your decision, Elon has not been paid for any of his work for Tesla for the past six years that has helped to generate significant growth and stockholder value, Denholm wrote. That strikes us  and the many stockholders from whom we already have heard  as fundamentally unfair, and inconsistent with the will of the stockholders who voted for it. In the filing, Tesla said it intends to appeal the decision. If shareholders approve the new package, disclosure and procedural deficiencies and breaches of the boards fiduciary duty detailed by McCormick should be fixed, the filing said. But Tesla said shareholders may still challenge the ratification vote. Even if it does pass, Tesla said it may not fully resolve the matter and a Delaware court could find the ratification itself is not fair to shareholders. If shareholders dont ratify the plan, Tesla said it may need to negotiate a replacement with Musk. That may take a lot of time and expense in light of the criticism detailed in the Delaware suit. Tesla is going the route of ratification, instead of trying to negotiate a new package with Musk, which the company said would likely need to be of similar magnitude to the previous package in order to keep him. Because its trying for ratification instead of a new plan, Tesla said it did not substantively re-evaluate the amount or term of the package and did not hire another compensation consultant to weigh in on it. In the 2018 plan, Musk would not get salary or cash bonuses. Instead he was to receive only stock options, and only if the company met certain thresholds. It would need to grow its total market value by certain amounts, while also hitting targets for revenue and pretax earnings, and other items. Many CEOs at big companies need to hit targets to get a lot of their possible compensation. Thats to encourage decisions that benefit the company and shareholders at large. But Musk was unusual in having all of his pay dependent on such measures. When the companys board drew up the compensation plan, it said it thought the hurdles would be challenging to meet. Some outsiders agreed. But the shareholder plaintiff in the Delaware suit alleged the companys proxy wrongly characterized all the milestones that triggered vesting in the stock options as stretch goals, even though internal projections indicated that three operational milestones were likely to be achieved within 18 months of the stockholder vote. The board said it believed in 2018 that many of Teslas prior successes were driven significantly by Mr. Musks leadership. And it wanted to motivate Musk to devote his time and energy to the company when he also had interests in other companies. Erik Gordon, a lawyer and business professor at the University of Michigan, said that since Tesla would still be a Delaware corporation at the time of the vote on the package, shareholders could still challenge it in Delaware courts. But because Tesla disclosed facts in the proxy about the boards ties to Musk, he would expect Tesla to win. If the uninterested shareholders are properly informed and they vote in favor of it, the court actually has nothing to do, Gordon said. Delaware courts, he said, want the corporations to disclose and let the shareholders decide. Musk may not see much legal benefit from moving Teslas corporate home to Texas, because the law governing executive pay is similar to Delawares, Gordon said. Theres no Texas case that tells you if this had happened in Texas youd have gotten a different result. Tesla posted record deliveries of more than 1.8 million electric vehicles worldwide in 2023, but the value its shares has eroded quickly this year as EV sales soften. The company said it delivered 386,810 vehicles from January through March, nearly 9 fewer than it sold in the same period last year. Future growth is in doubt and it may be a challenge to get shareholders to back a fat pay package in an environment where competition has increased worldwide. The proxy statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission does not address Musks demand to own 25 of Tesla shares for him to pursue artificial intelligence and robotics at the company. At present he owns 20.5 of the company. In January Musk challenged the Tesla board in a post on X, the social media platform he now owns, to come up with a new compensation package. Unless he gets 25, he wrote that hed prefer to build products outside of Tesla, apparently with another company. Wedbush analyst Dan Ives, who is normally bullish on Tesla, said in an interview that the filing doesnt address multiple issues including Musks future compensation. Its the elephant in the room because Musk has threatened over X, and its been a massive overhang for Tesla stock, Ives said. Musk, he said, needs to commit to being Tesla CEO for three to five years and developing artificial intelligence with the company. When Tesla announces first-quarter earnings next week, Musk needs to spell out growth plans, including the status of the Model 2, a small EV that costs about 25,000, Ives said. Otherwise, dark days lie ahead, he said. Theres a feeling like the plane is crashing into the ocean and the board is focused on their own salted peanuts, he said. At the time of the Delaware court ruling, Musks package was worth more than 55.8 billion, but the stock slide has cut that to 44.9 billion at the close of trading on Friday, Teslas filing said. Starting last year, Tesla has cut prices as much as 20,000 on some models. The price cuts caused used electric vehicle values to drop and clipped Teslas profit margins. This week, Tesla said it was letting about 10 of its workers go, about 14,000 people. Shares of Tesla Inc. closed down about 1 in Wednesday. Source: AP",

Members of the election body convened a meeting on Thursday (18) to study the documents submitted by the factions within the SLFP with regard to the recent changes made to the party positions. When the SLFPs politburo met on 08 April under the patronage of former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga, the partys incumbent Vice Chairman MP Nimal Siripala de Silva was appointed the new Acting President, and MP Duminda Dissanayake was selected as the General Secretary. These appointments came days after the Colombo District Court issued an enjoining order preventing former President Maithripala Sirisena from functioning as the SLPF chairman, following a complaint filed by Kumaratunga. This court order was later extended until 09 May. The documents pertaining to these new appointments were handed over to the Election Commission by MP Dissanayake while the partys Acting General Secretary Sarathi Dushmantha Mithrapala filed objections challenging them. When the Election Commission met on Thursday, the submitted materials were extensively reviewed by the members, who were of the view that the partys infighting should be resolved through the courts, as the election body has no authorization to do so under the existing legal scope and procedures. Pointing out that it can neither intervene nor take action regarding the internal crises of any political party, the election body members noted that they can, however, decide on accepting the nominations to SLFP candidates if the partys infighting is dragged out until after the elections are declared.",

        "title": "India heads to the polls in worlds biggest election",
        "date": "April 19, 2024 12:23 pm",
        "content": "Polls opened Friday for the first and largest phase of Indias marathon general election, kicking off a vote in which Prime Minister Narendra Modi is seeking to win a rare third consecutive term. About 969 million people are eligible to vote in the biggest election in human history, with polling taking place in seven phases over the next six weeks in the worlds most populous country. The nationwide vote is considered among the most consequential in decades as Modis powerful right-wing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) aims for an outright majority and a mandate to widen its development and Hindu-nationalist policies established during its 10-year rule. Those policies have transformed India economically and culturally, and BJP rule has been defined by a pull away from Indias secular foundation, toward Hindu majoritarianism. The 73-year-olds tenure has been marked by infrastructure and welfare projects, fervent Hindu nationalism, rapid economic expansion and an increasing presence on the world stage for the country of 1.4 billion people. But it has also been plagued by soaring youth unemployment and inequality, particularly in rural areas, and critics say Modi has driven religious polarization, which has included rising Islamophobia and persecution of the countrys 230 million Muslims. Still, Modis popularity is unparalleled for a two-term incumbent and his rallies have consistently drawn tens of thousands of supporters. As polls opened Friday, the leader had a message for voters. I urge all those voting in these seats to exercise their franchise in record numbers, he wrote on X. I particularly call upon the young and first time voters to vote in large numbers. After all, every vote counts and every voice matters! Development and democracy The BJPs campaign manifesto centers on job creation, anti-poverty programs such as expanding food handouts and housing schemes, and national development with particular focus on women, the poor, farmers and young people. Modi wants to turn the country into a global manufacturing hub, continue its massive infrastructure transformation, and achieve energy independence by 2047. On the world stage, Modi wants India to become a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, will push to bid for the 2036 Summer Olympics and aims to land an astronaut on the moon. The BJP has also pledged to implement a uniform civil code, which would replace a sprawl of religious and customary laws with a standard rule that everyone, regardless of faith, would be required to follow. The BJP says it will protect the rights of women, though some communities say it will interfere with their freedom of religion and customs. Challenging the BJP is the main opposition party, the Indian National Congress, and its newly formed INDIA alliance of parties. But the once-formidable force in Indian politics has been languishing since Modi rose to power a decade ago. And the INDIA alliance is already starting to show cracks, with defections and infighting. The opposition bloc is banking on a unified approach to counter BJP dominance. The Congress partys campaign is promising freedom from fear and vowing to protect democratic values such as freedom of speech, expression and religious belief espoused in the constitution. Its manifesto also emphasizes justice, equity and welfare, promising recognition of civil unions between LGBTQ couples, protection of religious minorities, and safety and empowerment of women, among other pledges such as apprenticeships for young graduates. It speaks directly to critiques from rights groups that the BJP is eroding democratic values, by promising to restore freedom of the media, to strengthen the autonomy of the Election Commission and other state agencies, and review laws passed by the BJP without proper parliamentary scrutiny and debate. Indias Election Commission has imposed restrictions on media, including CNN, that limits the publication of reporting and analysis in the run-up to and during polling days. Who is voting? Voters are casting their ballots for 543 seats in the lower house of parliament, or Lok Sabha, with a further two seats nominated by the countrys president. The party with the majority will form a government and appoint one of its winning candidates as prime minister. On Friday, voters from constituencies in 21 states and union territories across India will cast their ballots electronically. Some states are so big that voting is spread out over the seven phases, while others vote on one day. Among the most politically important states is Uttar Pradesh, home to 240 million people who vote in all seven phases. Indias largest state is a crucial battleground with 80 seats in the Lok Sabha up for grabs. Also voting Friday is the southern state of Tamil Nadu and its capital Chennai, where the regional Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam party and INDIA alliance will be vying to prevent the BJP from making inroads into a corner of India it has historically struggled to penetrate. West Bengal, a state of 102 million people and 42 Lok Sabha seats, will also vote in all seven phases, starting Friday. The BJP has struggled to crack the state, which has been long ruled by the All India Trinamool Congress and headed by political heavyweight Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee. Indian movie icon Rajinikanth was filmed casting his vote in Chennai, at a polling station decorated with pink balloons and blue drapes. The actor, synonymous with South Indian cinema, has starred in more than 160 movies in a decades-long career. In the northern city of Muzaffarnagar, Uttar Pradesh, voters began queuing outside polling stations before they opened. A bride arrived at a polling station in the city early Friday to cast her vote. Dressed in a red lehenga (a traditional wedding dress) and draped in diamond jewelry, she said she wanted to support her uncle, who was standing for election. It is the right of every citizen to cast their votes in elections, she told Indian news agency ANI. Voters in the northeastern state of Arunachal Pradesh, nestled in the foothills of the Himalayas, are also heading to the polls Friday. Video shared by the Election Commission shows workers trekking through forests, carrying election equipment on horses to reach a remote polling station. In the state of Meghalaya, also in the northeast, election workers carrying large boxes were filmed walking through lakes to reach polling booths. The remote Indian Ocean archipelago of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, home to indigenous tribes from among the worlds most isolated communities, will also vote Friday. So too will other northeastern states, including Mizoram, Nagaland on the border with Myanmar, as well as parts of Manipur, which has been gripped by ethnic violence over the past year, and the western state of Rajasthan. Indias Meteorological Department has predicted heatwave conditions in some of the places voting Friday, including parts of West Bengal and Puducherry. It also forecast severe rain for parts of Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan. Source: CNN --Agencies",

Finance State Minister Shehan Semasinghe and Central Bank Governor Dr. Nandalal Weerasinghe attended the roundtable, an initiative led by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank and G20 countries. The participants have reviewed progress on the work to improve debt restructuring processes and timelines, and to help address debt vulnerabilities. They also discussed priority areas for the work going forward. At the end of the meeting, the IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva, World Bank Group President Ajay Banga, and Finance Minister of Brazil Fernando Haddad, co-chairs of the GSDR, issued the GSDR 2nd Cochairs Progress Report. The compilation looks at the significant progress achieved in the international debt agenda in recent months. There has been an agreement in January 2024 between Ghana and their official bilateral creditors; an agreement in March 2024 between Zambia and the representatives of their Eurobond holders; and progress in the discussion of other cases, including Sri Lanka and Suriname. The report says the GSDR has contributed to this progress by providing a platform to advance understanding among key stakeholders on complex and critical issues. It has also helped forge consensus on how processes could be improved in future cases. The report also mentioned that ongoing debt restructurings have continued to make progress since October 2023, both within the common framework (CF), with Zambia and Ghana, and outside the CF, with Sri Lanka and Suriname.",

        "date": "April 19, 2024 02:17 pm",
        "content": "Kenyas defence chief and nine other top brass died on Thursday in a military helicopter crash in a remote area of the country, President William Ruto said. Today at 2:20 pm, our nation suffered a tragic air accident... I am deeply saddened to announce the passing of General Francis Omondi Ogolla, the Chief of the Kenya Defence Forces (CDF), Ruto told reporters. The president, who had convened an urgent meeting of the National Security Council after news of the accident emerged, said nine other gallant military personnel on board were also killed while two survived. Ogolla, 61, a trained fighter pilot, had only been in the post a year. Ruto said the Kenya Air Force had dispatched an investigation team to establish the cause of the crash, which took place in Elgeyo Marakwet county, about 400 kilometres (250 miles) northwest of the capital Nairobi. Ogollas helicopter went down shortly after takeoff from the village of Chesegon, where he and his entourage had been visiting a school after making stops in other areas to see Kenyan troops and other sites. Distinguished four-star general Ruto announced three days of mourning from Friday, with official flags to fly at half mast. The bodies of the victims, draped in Kenyan flags, were returned to Nairobi on an air force plane late Thursday, according to images shared by the presidency. A distinguished four-star general has fallen in the course of duty and service of the country, Ruto said. Our motherland has lost one of her most valiant generals, gallant officers, service men and women. Kenyan media reports said this was the fifth military chopper crash in 12 months, with claims the aircraft were old and poorly maintained. Ruto said Ogolla had left Nairobi on Thursday morning on a Huey helicopter to visit troops in the North Rift area deployed as part of Operation Maliza Uhalifu (Operation End Crime in Swalihi), and other sites. Kenyan authorities have long battled insecurity in the North Rift region, with armed bandits and cattle rustlers rampant. The Bell UH-1B helicopter, nicknamed the Huey, was developed in the 1950s and widely used by the US military during the Vietnam War. Significant loss to the nation The helicopter burst into flames after crashing and it had more than 10 senior commanders on board including General Ogolla, a police officer had told AFP earlier. They were in the area on a security mission because there are KDF (Kenya Defence Forces) soldiers deployed in the region, he added. Ogolla was appointed Chief of the Defence Forces by Ruto in April last year after a near two-year stint as deputy. Under Kenyan military regulations, the defence chief normally retires at 62 or after four years in the post, whichever comes first. Ruto told journalists last May that he appointed Ogolla despite him being among those who tried to overturn his narrow election win against opposition leader Raila Odinga in 2022. When I looked at his CV, he was the best person to be (a) general, Ruto said, adding his decision went against the wishes of many people. Ogolla joined the KDF in April 1984, rising through the ranks to command the Kenyan Air Force in 2018, a post he held for three years. Rutos predecessor Uhuru Kenyatta said Ogollas death was a significant loss to the nation. The CDF was not only an accomplished military leader, but also a devoted patriot who dedicated his life to serving and protecting our beloved country. Workneh Gebeyehu, secretary general of the regional grouping IGAD, sent his condolences in a message on X. This loss is not only felt by Kenya but also by the entire region, he added.

        "date": "April 19, 2024 03:38 pm",
        "content": "The 19-year-old Sri Lankan national charged in the mass killing of a newcomer family in Ottawa has no plan to seek bail, his lawyer says. Febrio De-Zoysa was arrested and charged in early March with six counts of first-degree murder and one count of attempted murder, after police found the family dead in a townhouse in the suburb of Barrhaven. He remains in custody, and his lawyer Ewan Lyttle told The Canadian Press there is presently no plan to apply for bail. De-Zoysa, who was studying in Canada as an international student, is set to return to court next week where lawyers expect to set dates for a preliminary inquiry in his case. Investigators allege the young man is responsible for the deaths of 35-year-old Darshani Ekanayake and her four children, who were between the ages of two months and seven years old, as well as a family friend. They believe the family was attacked with a knife or other edged weapon. As neighbours and Ottawa residents learned the first details of the gruesome crime, staff at Algonquin College in Ottawa were investigating the possible connections to the school. The colleges president asked his staff to look into it after Ottawa police Chief Eric Stubbs revealed at a press conference that De-Zoysa was an international student. Do we know where the suspect was studying?, Claude Brulé wrote in an email to a colleague that afternoon. The Canadian Press obtained the emails through a freedom-of-information request. He last attended classes in January of 2023, another member of the Algonquin College staff wrote back several hours later. The next day, Bruce Hickey, the colleges communication manager, said they had asked a colleague to run the names of the two adult deceased from Barrhaven through our system. The exact program De-Zoysa was registered for was redacted in the documents, as was most other personal information like his addresses, birthdate and student number. In a statement on Thursday, Hickey said the emails show the work college staff did to respond to the many media requests about the tragedy. He did not respond to questions about why the school searched the name of the adult victims or whether the school has been in touch with investigators about the information they found. The emails show that several members of the media, including The Canadian Press, pressed the college for more information in the immediate aftermath of the killings. In one email, Hickey said were still holding on our original lines. Pulling in as much detail as I can on this (colleges) connections today. Will keep you posted. Emails show how the school was also dealing with international media attention. Had to send this one your way  the requests just keep coming  from everywhere, Hickey wrote when an NBC News reporter in Los Angeles inquired about De-Zoysa. Really? one member of the staff responded. Los Angeles?? All the victims found in the townhome except the youngest child were Sri Lankan nationals who arrived in the city within the past several years. The family friend, 40-year-old Gamini Amarakoon Amarakoon Mudiyanselage, had a wife and two children living in Sri Lanka, according to leaders at a Buddhist temple the family attended. Police say De-Zoysa had been living at the familys rented townhouse, and a monk at the temple said the young man had been struggling mentally. The sole survivor of the alleged attack was Dhanushka Wickramasinghe, the familys father and husband, who was taken to hospital with injuries to his hands and face. He has since been released and requested privacy as he mourns the loss of his family. Ottawa Mayor Mark Sutcliffe has called the killings one of the most shocking incidents of violence in the citys history. Source: The Canadian Press -Agencies",

        "date": "April 19, 2024 04:37 pm",
        "content": "State Minister of Finance Shehan Semasinghe says that the government is confident of reaching resolution with commercial creditors and the private bondholders which will enable Sri Lanka to be a debt sustainable country, as the engagements with them are underway. In a recent interview with IMF Today on the sidelines of the IMF (International Monetary Fund) and World Bank Group Spring Meetings 2024, the Finance State Minister shed light on Sri Lankas remarkable journey from economic turmoil to stabilization and now towards growth. Semasinghes statements underscored the governments commitment to the IMF program, debt restructuring process and the tax revenue. He also reflected on the challenges Sri Lanka faced in 2022, calling it the most challenging year for the country due to the economic crisis post-Covid-19 pandemic. However, he expressed gratitude towards the Sri Lankan citizens for their resilience during these difficult periods. We are improving. Economy has shown great signs of stabilization and the IMF program is bearing fruits now and translated into results, he said. Well, if you go back to 2022, it was the most challenging year for Sri Lanka. The entire country was suffering with the economic crisis post-Covid-19 pandemic. Then in 2022, we reached the IMF to have a program. From there onwards, we have been committed to the IMF program. We also thank people of Sri Lanka for remaining resilient during this difficult time. However, we are happy that we have recovered, but now we are moving towards growth. If you look at our numbers we have moved towards growth after contraction of 6 consecutive quarters. So in 2023 third quarter we have shown a growth, in fourth quarter we have shown a 4.5 growth, thats a healthy sign in economic terms. 2024 is going to be a good year for us, he expressed. We remain committed. Thats the ambition of the government and we will continue with the macroeconomic stability which we have reached so far, Semasinghe emphasized, highlighting the governments dedication to ensuring economic stability and growth. Semasinghe pointed out that the country had one of the lowest tax revenues globally but has since made strides in increasing revenue through measures such as removing tax exemptions, strengthening tax compliance, and embracing digitization. We had one of the lowest tax revenues in the world.  When we embarked on the program, we have gradually increased our tax revenues  The government revenue has gone up to 11 of the GDP in 2023. So that is from 8.1 of the government revenue. In 2024, we expect the numbers to move to 12. We are confident that we will reach that figure. There are additional measures being taken by the government, that is on digitization. Thats because we think that tax structure needs to be digitized and with the recent initiatives we have taken, we have already had 130 growth in tax compliance, tax registration. Thats a good number but cannot be happy with it. We need everybody who should pay taxes to pay them. As I said earlier we have removed exemptions, and there wont be no revenue leakages. We will be extra cautious on getting the revenues up. In turn, that will help us to ensure the welfare of the citizens. The State Minister also addressed the issue of debt crisis, acknowledging its role in exacerbating the economic challenges faced by Sri Lanka. However, he expressed optimism about the ongoing negotiations with bilateral creditors and the progress made in reaching agreements in principle. We are now working on converting it to MoUs. We had an official creditor committee which was co-chaired by Japan, France and India. China was sitting outside the official creditor committee but were happy that we reached agreements in principle with all out bilateral creditors. Were having engagements with commercial creditors and the private bondholders. Were confident that we will reach resolution which will enable Sri Lanka to be a debt sustainable country, Semasinghe assured.",

        "date": "April 19, 2024 04:44 pm",
        "content": "Oil slipped on Friday after prices spiked earlier on reports that Israel had attacked Iran as market fears of a major escalation to hostilities in the Mideast appeared to ease. After the benchmark contracts jumped more than 3 in the session, Brent futures were down 46 cents, or 0.5, at 86.65 a barrel by 1015 GMT. The most active U.S. West Texas Intermediate contract was down 34 cents, or 0.4, to 82.39. Israel launched an attack on Iranian soil on Friday, sources told Reuters. Iranian media reported explosions, but an Iranian official told Reuters those were caused by air defence systems. State media said three drones over the central city of Isfahan had been shot down. Tehran played down the incident and indicated it had no plans for retaliation - a response that appeared gauged towards averting region-wide war. Whilst the initial spike in oil may have highlighted the initial fear of further escalation, we have seen both equities and crude reverse some of those preliminary moves, said Joshua Mahony, chief market analyst at Scope Markets. Events of the past week appear to be more about showing their willingness to act rather than actually seeking to incite a war ...For markets this is a best case scenario. Last weekend Iran launched hundreds of drones and missiles in a retaliatory strike after a suspected Israeli attack on its embassy compound in Syria. Most of the drones and missiles were downed before reaching Israeli territory, with minimal damage and casualties. Investors have been closely monitoring Israels reaction to the April 13 Iranian drone attacks. The geopolitical risk premium in oil prices had been unwinding this week on the perception that any Israeli retaliation to Irans attack would be moderated by international pressure. The U.S. also announced sanctions on Iran, an OPEC member, targeting its unmanned aerial vehicle production after the countrys attack on Israel. The sanctions on Iran, however, exclude its oil industry. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "date": "April 19, 2024 05:56 pm",
        "content": "Japans benchmark Nikkei Stock Average on Friday morning fell as much as 1,346.7 yen, or 3.5, from the previous days close as market players reacted to reports of Israel striking Iran with missiles. Nikkei stock average closed at 37,068.35 yen, down 2.66 from the previous day. South Koreas benchmark KOSPI closed down 1.6, after falling as much as 3.1 in midday trading. Samsung Electronics dropped 2.5, while SK Hynix plunged 4.9. The Hong Kong-based Hang Seng Index closed 0.99 lower at 16,244.14, while CSI 300, which tracks the largest names listed in Shenzhen and Shanghai, China, dropped 0.70 for the day to 3,541.66 on Friday. The downtrend began overnight with high-tech stocks in the U.S. Selling escalated in Tokyo as investors heeded a U.S. media report that Israeli missiles had hit a site in Iran. ABC News reported that Israel had attacked Iran, citing a senior U.S. official. CBS News said its sources did not disclose the location or extent of the Israeli strikes. Reuters later reported that an Iranian official said there was no missile attack against Iran. Following earlier reports by Iranian media about explosions heard in Isfahan, the official told Reuters that the noise was a result of the activation of Irans air defense systems. The plunge in Asian stock markets in the morning eased by the afternoon, following initial reactions to early reports of the explosions. Nikkei Stock Average fell below the 37,000 mark during trading hours for the first time in two and a half months as value-laden semiconductor-related stocks were sold, marking the largest single-day fall this year. Major chip-related stocks such as Tokyo Electron, Screen Holdings and Lasertec all fell temporarily by more than 7. The stock market sell-off is led by speculative players, according to Yutaka Miura, a senior technical analyst at Mizuho Securities. The news of the Israeli attack on Iran apparently triggered a computer algorithm that is programmed to sell stocks and buy bonds, the yen and oil, mainly through futures, he suggested. Institutional investors are staying on the sidelines to see how things unfold. Theyd like to know whether the tensions will escalate to a blockade of the Strait of Hormuz, and how the U.S. market will respond to the situation, said Miura. Thailands benchmark SET index closed down 2.17 on Friday, with losses among the bourses top 50 stocks led by energy distributors and power components suppliers. In the oil market, West Texas Intermediate futures rose to more than 86 per barrel at one point, up 4 from the previous day. Brent crude oil futures rose 4, exceeding 90. I am a bit scared about what will happen to commodities and what flows into the dollar would mean for the yen and emerging-market currencies, said Shoki Omori, chief desk strategist at Mizuho Securities. The safe-haven yen strengthened to the 153 range against the dollar on Friday morning before weakening to 154.26. Elsewhere in the region, the South Korean won declined to 1,385.75 against the U.S. dollar, the Australian dollar to 1.5646, and the Indonesian rupiah to 16,262. The Indian rupee opened Friday at a record low of 83.5550 to the dollar. Asian currencies are likely to remain under pressure due to the heightened geopolitical tensions between Iran and Israel, with fears of Iran closing off routes for the oil trade, which would push the commoditys price higher. I think Asia in particular has probably felt it more acutely in the foreign exchange market than other places, said Francesca Fornasari, head of currency at Insight Investment, a currency-solution provider under BNY Mellon Investment Management. On top of geopolitics, the likelihood of diversion from central bank policies, where Asia could lower rates while the Federal Reserve keeps them high as U.S. inflation stays sticky, would exert further pressure on Asia local currencies, Fornasari said.

        "date": "April 19, 2024 07:32 pm",
        "content": "Friday, April 19, 2024, was a special day for K. Nalini, as the 38-year-old homemaker from the Kottapattu camp for Sri Lankan refugees in Tiruchi district, became the first naturalised Indian national from her community to exercise her franchise at the booth at St. Lourdes Primary School. My only hope is for my family and children to be able to progress and live without fear in India, as Indians, Ms. Nalini told The Hindu. The Tamil Nadu government has taken good care of the 450 families in our camp, by providing free electricity, water and medical aid, but the lack of official identity papers remains a stumbling block for many of the older residents, she added. In September 2022, Ms. Nalini had established before the Madras High Court that she was an Indian citizen. She had enrolled as a voter of the Tiruchi (East) Assembly constituency, which comes under the Tiruchi Lok Sabha constituency, and had gone to the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court to secure a passport. It was given to her after she won the case. She applied for a voter ID through an e-service centre and received it by post in due course. Born at the Sri Lankan refugee camp in Mandapam in April 1986, Ms. Nalinis parentage is Indian, though generations of her family had migrated to Sri Lanka to work on the tea estates there. She was granted citizenship as the year of her birth fell between January 26, 1950 and July 1, 1987, a period that made those born in India eligible for automatic naturalisation as Indians. I have spent all my life in camps, and have seen the hardships that can cause mental and social agony among young people. My husband is an autorickshaw driver and his income supports me and our two sons. I feel proud to have voted today, and hope the voice of our people will be heard by whoever comes to power, said Ms. Nalini. Source: The Hindu --Agencies",

        "title": "China writes off interest-free loans given to Zimbabwe",
        "date": "April 20, 2024 09:17 am",
        "content": "China has written off an unspecified amount of Zimbabwes interest-free loans and pledged to help the Southern African country find a way out of its debt crisis, even as activists warned of a permanent debt trap. As of September 2023, Zimbabwes publicly guaranteed debt stood at 17.7 billion, of which 12.7 billion was external and 5 billion domestic. Most of the foreign debt was purchased from China, as the country is ineligible for loans from multilateral creditors such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) after defaulting on repayments since the turn of the millennium. Since the fall of long-time ruler Robert Mugabe six years ago, Zimbabwe has been struggling to reach an agreement with creditors to restructure its unsustainable debt. Former Mozambican president Joachim Chissano and African Development Bank President Dr Akinwumi Adesina are leading the debt restructuring dialogue, which suffered a blow last month when the United States withdrew its support, citing Harares reluctance to reform. China, now Zimbabwes largest non-Paris Club creditor, says it is ready to help the country resolve its debt quagmire. Some estimates put Zimbabwes debt to China at 3 billion. China attaches great importance to resolving Zimbabwes debt issues, said Chinas ambassador to Zimbabwe Zhou Ding. China would like to enhance communication with the Zimbabwe government to work out proper statements through friendly consultation. As a concrete measure, China has cancelled Zimbabwes interest-free loans, which matured by the end of 2015. Mr Zhou did not disclose the amount of loans written off, but observers said it may not be much, as Zimbabwe increased its Chinese debt for infrastructure projects after the end of Mr Mugabes nearly four-decade rule. Military coup Zimbabwes founding leader was replaced by President Emmerson Mnangagwa following a military coup in 2017. President Mnangagwas government has continued to borrow heavily from China, but Mr Zhou said it was not true that Zimbabwe was now in a death trap because of excessive Chinese loans. According to the data released by the Zimbabwean government, Zimbabwes debt owed to Western countries and international financial institutions accounts for 70 per cent of its external debt, while the debt owed to China only accounts for 15 per cent, he said. In August 2022, China announced that it would provide 23 interest-free loans to 17 unnamed African countries, a move analysts said at the time was designed to counter accusations that Beijing was engaging in debt-trap diplomacy. Political leverage Critics accuse China of deliberately lending to countries it knows cannot repay to increase its political leverage as it seeks to counter US influence in Africa. China vehemently denies the accusations, saying its relations with African countries are based on its policy of non-interference in other countries affairs. In its latest debt analysis, the Zimbabwe Coalition on Debt and Development (Zimcodd) said loan defaults during Mr Mugabes era and the countrys long-running economic problems had left Zimbabwe in a debt overhang. The debt default of the early 200s, coupled with a shrinking economy, has attracted prohibitive penalties and subdued the capacity to service debts, thus trapping Zimbabwe in a debt overhang position, Zimcodd said. Also due to these high debt arrears, access to concessionary loan finance has been blocked. As such, predatory creditors are taking advantage of Zimbabwes debt crisis by fuelling debt expansion mortgaging natural resources and mineral revenues. 400 million loan Last year, Zimbabwe secured a 400 million loan from Afreximbank for budget support and financing of trade-related infrastructure, which it will repay by using 38 per cent of the export earnings of the countrys largest platinum miner. The previous year, the government announced that the country had borrowed 200 million from China, securing the loan with 26 million ounces of platinum reserves. Zimcodd said Zimbabwe was at risk of falling into a permanent debt overhang given complex global challenges such as climate change and deteriorating global geopolitics. If left unresolved, the debt crisis will permanently trap Zimbabwe into a vicious debt trap of continuous borrowing, accumulation of arrears and subsequent defaults, the organisation added. The sustenance of high indebtedness constrains development through limited access to concessionary funding, currency devaluations, rising cost of money and sluggish economic growth. So, Zimbabwe faces an impossible choice between serving its people or serving mounting debts. China loaned Zimbabwe billions of dollars to upgrade two of its main international airports and to expand its two main thermal and hydroelectric power stations. Source: The East African --Agencies",

        "date": "April 20, 2024 11:16 am",
        "content": "A man has set himself on fire outside the court in Manhattan where former President Donald Trumps hush-money trial is being held. The man doused himself in a liquid before throwing conspiracy-theory pamphlets into the air, police said. His motive is unknown and police responded to the scene. Mr Trump was in the building to attend jury selection, where he has had a security detail, but the former president left during the incident. Emergency officials said that court security had not been breached in the incident. The case, which had just completed alternate jury selection, resumed later in the afternoon. Opening statements are expected to begin on Monday. In a news conference, investigators said they had received a 911 emergency call at around 13:30 local time (18:30 BMT) telling them that a man had lit himself on fire. They identified him as Maxwell Azzarello, 37, who had arrived in New York from his home in Florida sometime in the past week. He has no criminal record in New York, and his family in Florida were unaware that he had travelled to the city. New York Police Chief Jeffrey Maddrey said Mr Azzarello was seen shuffling around in the park before reaching into a bag for the flammable liquid and pamphlets. The pamphlets were propaganda-based, said Chief Maddrey, adding that they were regarding a conspiracy theory. There was a massive police presence outside the courthouse because of the trial, and officers quickly ran into the park shouting for a fire extinguisher. Mr Azzarello was carried away on a stretcher, his body badly burned. The police said he was taken to a hospital burn centre in critical condition. Witness Julie Berman told reporters: It was hot, and it didnt make a lot sense. The whole thing happened so fast... it took me like 20 seconds to figure out what was going on. NYPD investigators were later seen collecting pamphlets that Mr Azzarello had scattered before self-immolating. They have deemed the area safe. Investigators are still interviewing witnesses and said he didnt appear to say anything before setting fire to himself. Three NYPD officers and one court officer had minor injuries after helping to extinguish the blaze. Officials said they will now reassess security outside the court. Source: BBC --Agencies",

        "date": "April 20, 2024 01:58 pm",
        "content": "North Korea has released a new song praising leader Kim Jong Un for being a friendly father and a great leader, in a move that appears to be part of a propaganda drive to enhance his standing in the reclusive state. The music video for the song was aired on the state-controlled Korean Central Television on Wednesday. It features North Koreans of different backgrounds ranging from children to troops and medical staff exuberantly belting out lines such as: Lets sing, Kim Jong Un the great leader and Lets brag about Kim Jong Un, a friendly father. A live performance of the song accompanied by an orchestra and watched by Kim was also broadcast on state television as part of a ceremony to mark the completion of building 10,000 new homes. The Kim family dynasty that has ruled North Korea since its founding after World War Two have sought to strengthen their grip on power by building cults of personality around them. The release of the upbeat song titled Friendly Father comes at time when North Korean state media has recently changed the name it uses for a public holiday, prompting speculation that the move is part of efforts to solidify Kims position. Instead of calling the annual public holiday celebrating the birth of the countrys founder Kim Il Sung Day of the Sun, state media has started mostly referring to it as the more neutral April holiday. Such changes might be part of an effort by Kim to stand on his own feet without relying on his predecessors, an official at South Koreas Unification Ministry said. Source: Reuters -Agencies",

        "title": "Uncertainty looms over Sri Lanka as debt restructuring talks hit snag  experts warn",
        "date": "April 20, 2024 05:24 pm",
        "content": "Having hit a roadblock with international bondholders, uncertainty looms over the economy of crisis-hit Sri Lanka and an upcoming review by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), experts warn. The South Asian island country announced on Tuesday that it has failed to strike an agreement with international bondholders on restructuring more than 12 billion in debt, a mandatory requirement set out by the IMF. Colombo-based economist Talal Rafi explained that with Sri Lanka still in default status and facing uncertainty regarding credit ratings and foreign investment, the economic fallout could be significant. The larger impact is the uncertainty as no one knows what the deal will be for them to plan anything, he said. In March last year, the IMFs board approved a 2.9 billion bailout package under a 48-month arrangement under the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) to support Sri Lankas economic policies and reforms. Sri Lanka is currently on its second review and is awaiting board approval for a staff-level agreement reached in March this year. Since 1965 to 2016, Sri Lanka has had a total of 16 programs with the IMF and the current program with IMF is the seventeenth. The delay in reaching an agreement could also affect Sri Lankas upcoming IMF review, which is scheduled for June, Rafi said. As debt restructuring is a key condition for the IMF, it would have an impact on the time taken for board approval. The program specifically supports Sri Lankas efforts to restore macroeconomic stability and debt sustainability, safeguard financial stability, and enhance growth-oriented structural reforms. In April 2022, the country defaulted on its foreign debt for the first time, triggering the worst economic crisis in its history. According to official data, Sri Lankas gross official foreign currency reserves inched up to 4.5 billion million in February. Moreover, the nations impending presidential election piles pressure on the government to accelerate the negotiation process, raising concerns about the sustainability of any deal struck hastily under such circumstances. In a rushed environment, there is a chance an unfavorable deal may be struck, where the debt repayments agreed may be unsustainable for Sri Lanka to pay in the coming years which could lead to a second default, Rafi noted. Sri Lanka is expected to hold its presidential election between September and October. In 2019, Gotabaya Rajapaksa was elected as president, but he was forced to resign due to mismanagement in 2022, which led to Ranil Wickremesinghe taking over. Presidential elections take place every 5 years. Despite the stumbling block, Sagala Ratnayaka, Sri Lankas national security adviser and chief of staff to the president, said there is no snag, but the discussions will continue. He explained that the government couldnt come to a settlement specifically in two areas of the counter-proposals submitted to the government by bondholders. However, Rathnayaka emphasized the governments commitment to continuing discussions and involving all stakeholders, including bond advisers and representatives from the IMF. Shehan Semasinghe, Sri Lankas finance minister, said in a statement on Wednesday, The next steps would entail further consultation with the IMF staff regarding assessments of the compatibility of the latest proposals with program parameters. He added, We hope to continue discussions with the bondholders with a view to reaching common ground ahead of the IMF board consideration of the second review of Sri Lankas EFF program. However, Sergi Lanau, director of global emerging markets strategy at Oxford Economics, said that debt restructuring is progressing slowly everywhere. Ghana, for example, defaulted in December 2022 and is still negotiating, he said. I dont think there are widespread expectations of a quick agreement in Sri Lanka. Reflecting on the lack of trust and transparency that has characterized the negotiations from the outset, W.A. Wijewardena, a former central bank deputy governor, said, The outcome involving the failure to reach agreement is not unanticipated because neither party had any intention of reaching out to the other. According to Wijewardena, the trust necessary for a fair negotiation was absent. Now it seems both parties are asking for the pound of flesh which isnt available for delivery to the other party.

        "date": "April 20, 2024 10:24 pm",
        "content": "Pakistan has made formal request to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for seeking next bailout package in the range of 6 to 8 billion under Extended Fund Facility (EFF) with possibility of augmentation through climate financing, The News reported on Saturday. However, the exact size and timeframe will only be determined after evolving consensus on the major contours of the next programme in May 2024. The News sent out message to the members of Pakistani delegations, who are currently visiting Washington for attending the annual spring meetings of the IMFWorld Bank, but got no reply till filing of this report. Pakistan has shown its interest and also made a request to dispatch the IMF review mission in May 2024 to firm up details of the next bailout package of three years period under EFF programme. Although, Pakistani authorities are pitching rosy picture of the economy but the IMF, in its latest Regional Economic Outlook (REO), released by Middle East and Central Asia (MECA) department stated that Pakistans external buffers deteriorated, mostly reflecting ongoing debt service, including Eurobond repayments. Where inflationary pressures persist, monetary policy should remain tight and follow a data-dependent approach (Egypt, Kazakhstan, Pakistan, Tunisia, Uzbekistan), while closely monitoring risks of a reversal of inflation developments, it added. After contracting in 2023, growth in Pakistan is projected to rebound to 2 in 2024, supported by continuing positive base effects in the agriculture and textile sectors. Moroccos growth projection has been revised down by 0.5 percentage point since October to 3.1, largely reflecting slowing domestic demand. Further ahead, growth in MENA emerging market and middle-income economies (EMMIs) and Pakistan is projected to accelerate to nearly 4 in 2025 as constraints to growth this year (tight policies and country-specific events, including spillovers from conflict) begin to wane. Nonetheless, continued tight macroeconomic policies to tackle high levels of debt and inflation in some countries, coupled with persistent structural challenges, are expected to hold back medium-term economic activity, with growth remaining below historical averages in most economies. In turn, public sector gross financing needs will remain a significant challenge for most EMMIs and Pakistan. Public gross financing needs over 2024 are projected to rise to nearly 115 of fiscal revenues (261.3 billion), an increase of about 5.6 percentage points compared to the IMFs October projections. Pakistan aims to agree outline of new IMF loan in May: Aurangzeb Meanwhile, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb told the World Bank in Washington that with the reform agenda fully implemented in key areas, Pakistans economy has the potential to grow to 3 trillion by 2047. Pakistan hopes to agree the contours of a new IMF loan in May, Aurangzeb told Reuters, and has kicked off talks with ratings agencies to lay the groundwork for a return to international debt markets. We expect the IMF mission to be in Islamabad around the middle of May  and that is when some of these contours will start developing, said Aurangzeb, who met with the Funds Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva on Wednesday during the IMF and World Bank spring meetings. He declined to outline what size programme the government hoped to secure, though Pakistan is expected to seek at least 6 billion. Aurangzeb added that once the IMF loan was agreed, Pakistan would also request additional financing from the Fund under the Resilience and Sustainability Trust. The debt situation also looked more benign, Aurangzeb said. The bulk of our bilateral debt  including our China debt  is being rolled over, so in that sense I think we are in good shape and I dont see a big issue during this fiscal year nor next fiscal year, cause we need to repay roughly 25 billion dollars every fiscal year. Pakistan also hopes to come back to international capital markets, possibly with a green bond. However, there was some more work to be done before that happens, said Aurangzeb.

        "date": "April 21, 2024 11:15 am",
        "content": "In a landmark study published recently in the journal Mitochondrion, 10 researchers from five institutions -- including Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi; University of Colombo, Sri Lanka; CSIR-Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology, Hyderabad; University of Bern, Switzerland; and Postgraduate Institute of Archaeology, University of Kelaniya, Colombo -- unveiled significant findings regarding the genetic history of the Vedda population, an indigenous group of Sri Lanka. The study, which involved a comprehensive analysis of high-resolution autosomal and mitochondrial genomes, sheds new light on the initial peopling of Sri Lanka and the ancient genetic ties between the Vedda and other populations in Asia. The key findings from the research indicate that despite the lack of close linguistic similarities, the Vedda people share a significant genetic link with the ethnic populations in India. Our autosomal analyses suggest a close genetic connection between the Vedda and Indian ethnic populations speaking various tongues, pointing towards a deep-rooted history that predates linguistic diversifications, said Prof Gyaneshwer Chaubey, one of the authors of the study and a molecular anthropologist at BHU. Dr K Thangaraj, one of the senior authors of the study and a JC Bose Fellow at CSIR-Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology, Hyderabad, said that the language isolates Vedda, who are among the least studied indigenous populations in Sri Lanka, have long intrigued scientists and historians alike due to their unique linguistic and cultural characteristics. This study, therefore, unravels the mysteries of their genetic origins and affinities with Indian populations. The lead author, Dr Ruwandi Ranasingh from Colombo University, Sri Lanka, said that maternal DNA analysis supports the existence of an ancient link, reinforcing the notion of a shared genetic heritage. The study proposes that the Vedda population has undergone genetic drift and a recent bottleneck, resulting in a unique genetic makeup with limited gene flow from neighboring Sinhalese and Sri Lankan Tamil populations. According to the first author, Anjana Welikala from the Institute of Biochemistry, Molecular Biology, and Biotechnology, University of Colombo, this unique discovery challenges the conventional isolation-by-distance model and underscores the distinct demographic history of the Vedda. The implications of this research are vast, offering novel perspectives on the demographic history of not only Sri Lanka but also the broader South Asian region. This study underscores the complex mosaic of human migration and genetic diversity in South Asia, revealing how Veddas have preserved their genetic identity over millennia despite massive cultural and linguistic changes around them. These valuable insights will contribute to a better understanding of the genetic diversity in South Asia and foster a deeper appreciation for the unique cultural and genetic heritage of the Vedda people, said the researchers.
