        "title": "New law by end of 2023 to transform Port City into Colombo Financial Zone",
        "date": "September 26, 2023 01:33 pm",
        "content": "A new law is set to be introduced to transform the Colombo Port City into a Financial Zone, President Ranil Wickremesinghe revealed today (26 Sep.). Speaking at the 2023 Commercial Mediation Symposium held at the Hilton Hotel in Colombo this afternoon, the Head of State revealed that the new legislation would transform Port City into the Colombo Financial Zone, granting it jurisdiction over offshore activities. The relevant new law is expected to be enacted by the end of 2023, President Wickremesinghe said. In his address to the symposium, the Head of State emphasised the need for a cultural shift towards efficient dispute resolution in Sri Lanka. He acknowledged the long-standing reliance on trial courts and stressed the importance of embracing alternate dispute resolution methods. Highlighting the governments commitment, he mentioned the establishment of the Alternate Dispute Resolution Center in 2018 and expressed support for its continued growth. President Wickremesinghe urged the Ministry of Justice and Ministry of Investments to collaborate on supporting these initiatives. Alternate dispute resolution, arbitration, both have a long way to travel in Sri Lanka and thats our problem. We have to first find ways of how we can adjust to this process. You need a change of culture. Change of culture where disputes can be resolved in the shortest possible time. Which means we are in a way wedded to the old concept of the trial court? Whether we have a domestic inquiry, we all want to follow the same procedure. I dont know why. But nevertheless, this is one of the challenges that we have to face. He emphasized that success in dispute resolution was crucial for Sri Lankas aspirations to be an outward-looking economy. The President mentioned forthcoming legislation to transform the Port City as the Colombo financial zone and the transition from the BOI to the Economic Commission, both aimed at resolving disputes efficiently. President Wickremesinghe also underscored the significance of international trade agreements and the need for Sri Lanka to become a center for alternate dispute resolution. He urged legal professionals to look beyond Sri Lankas borders and specialize in emerging fields like AI, Blockchain and green energy to secure the nations competitive future. Now we want Sri Lanka to be a center. One is the new legislation which will replace the port city to make it a Colombo financial zone with jurisdiction for offshore activity. The new law has been drafted. And we will see the light of day before the end of the year. Secondly, the BOI will be replaced with the Economic Commission. Which is also looking at the resolution of disputes. We will be entering a number of free trade agreements. We have got one with Singapore. We are about to finalize one with Thailand. We are discussing with India of upgrading agreement. Talking with Bangladesh. And more than that, we are moving to join the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP). Thats the largest trading community in the world. So this means that alternate dispute resolutions are going to be important. In a final call to action, he offered government funding to support learning and expertise development in these new areas, inviting all stakeholders to join in the journey towards a more efficient and forward-looking legal landscape in Sri Lanka. President Wickremesinghe emphasized that Sri Lanka must position itself as the central player in the region. When examining Singapore as a benchmark, Sri Lanka should strive to match or surpass Singapore in various aspects, except for cost, where it should maintain a competitive advantage. This approach is crucial because there exists a noticeable void in this region, which Sri Lanka can effectively fill if it acts swiftly. This is the key lesson to be derived. Furthermore, it is essential for all lawyers and individuals involved in legal services to broaden their perspectives and explore opportunities beyond their current scope, the President added. The event was organized by International Alternative Dispute Resolution Centre (IADRC) and the event was graced by the presence of the Minister of Justice, Prison Affairs and Constitutional Reforms Dr. Wijeyadasa Rajapaksha P.C., State Minister of Justice, Prison Affairs and Constitutional Reforms Mr. Anuradha Jayarathne, Judges of the Supreme Court, Attorney General, Former Attorney Generals, Retired Judges of the Supreme Court, Resident Representative of UNDP Ms. Azusa Kubota, Secretary to the Ministry of Justice, Prison Affairs and Constitutional Reforms, Chairman of IADRC Dr. K.

        "date": "September 26, 2023 01:47 pm",
        "content": "An explosion at a fuel depot in Azerbaijans Nagorno-Karabakh has killed 20 people and injured hundreds more, local Armenian authorities say. Nearly 300 people were admitted to hospitals, with dozens of them still in critical condition. It comes as the Armenian government said 13,350 refugees crossed into the country from the enclave. The disputed Nagorno-Karabakh region is home to a majority of some 120,000 ethnic Armenians. It is not yet clear what caused the explosion on Monday evening in the main city of Stepanakert. Human Rights Ombudsman Gegham Stepanyan wrote on social media: As a result of the explosion in the fuel warehouse, the number of injured exceeds 200. The health condition of the majority is severe or extremely severe. The medical capacities of Nagorno-Karabakh are not enough. In a statement on Tuesday local officials said 13 unidentified bodies were found at the scene and seven more died in hospital. Since Azerbaijans seizure of Nagorno-Karabakh last week, thousands of people have left the area after the Armenian government in Yerevan announced plans to move those made homeless by the fighting. Armenias Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan has said that ethnic cleansing is under way in the region. Thats happening just now, and that is very unfortunate fact because we were trying to urge international community on that, Nikol Pashinyan told reporters. Azerbaijan has said it wants to re-integrate the ethnic Armenians as equal citizens. The BBC has spoken to some of the refugees who arrived in the city of Goris in Armenia on Sunday, close to the border to Karabakh. I gave my whole life to my homeland, said one man. It would be better if they killed me than this. A woman, Veronica, told the BBC that this was the second time she had become a refugee. The first time was during the conflict in 2020. Envoys from Armenia and Azerbaijan are due to meet in Brussels on Tuesday for European Union-backed talks. It will be the first time diplomatic talks are held since Azerbaijan seized the enclave last week. The two sides will be represented by their national security advisors. Nagorno-Karabakh - a mountainous region in the South Caucasus - is recognised internationally as part of Azerbaijan, but has been controlled by ethnic Armenians for three decades. The enclave has been supported by Armenia - but also by their ally, Russia, which has had hundreds of soldiers there for years. Five Russian peacekeepers were killed - alongside at least 200 ethnic Armenians and dozens of Azerbaijani soldiers - as Azerbaijans army swept in last week. On Sunday, Azerbaijans defence ministry said it had confiscated more military equipment including a large number of rockets, artillery shells, mines and ammunition. Despite Azerbaijans public reassurances, there are fears about the residents of Nagorno-Karabakh, with only one aid delivery of 70 tonnes of food having been allowed through since separatists accepted a ceasefire and agreed to disarm. Ethnic Armenian leaders say thousands are without food or shelter and sleeping in basements, school buildings or outside. Source: BBC -Agencies",

        "content": "The Colombo District Court today (26) suspended the interim injunction preventing the implementation of a letter issued by the chairman of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP), former President Maithripala Sirisena to Dayasiri Jayasekara, who was recently ousted as the partys General Secretary. Colombo District Judge Sandun Vithana had issued this interim injunction order on Thursday (21), to be in effect until October 05, 2023, after considering a complaint filed by Dayasiri Jayasekara. Appearing for the defendant, former president Maithripala Sirisena, Presidents Counsel Faizer Mustapha pointed out that the Central Committee of the SLFP, in fact, has the authority to issue such a letter. The presidents counsel, who further mentioned that the complainant had obtained the interim injunction by concealing certain facts, requested the court to issue an order dismissing the injunction. The Colombo District judge, taking the submission into consideration, ordered the relevant injunction order to be suspended. Then, he fixed the case to be taken up again on November 05, 2023. However, former General Secretary of the SLFP Dayasiri Jayasekara had mentioned in his complaint that the partys chairman Maithripala Sirisena had directed a letter on September 18, which mentioned that a disciplinary inquiry would be conducted against Jayasekara and asked him to provide excuses to defend himself. Jayasekara had also claimed that pursuant to the SLFPs constitution, the party chairman has no authority to issue such letters. Accordingly, Jayasekara had filed this complaint seeking an order ruling that the letter in question was unlawful.",

        "date": "September 26, 2023 02:56 pm",
        "content": "David McCallum, the British actor who became a star by playing a secret agent in 1960s spy drama The Man From U.N.C.L.E., has died at the age of 90. More recently, McCallum was known for his long-running role as a medical examiner on hit CBS programme NCIS. We will miss his warmth and endearing sense of humor that lit up any room or soundstage he stepped onto, the NCIS account said on social media. The Scottish-born actor also starred in TV shows Colditz and Sapphire  Steel. David was a gifted actor and author, and beloved by many around the world, the NCIS tribute said. He led an incredible life, and his legacy will forever live on through his family and the countless hours on film and television that will never go away. His role as mysterious Russian agent Illya Kuryakin in The Man from U.N.C.L.E. won him many fans and made him one of the decades biggest TV stars. The series ended in 1968, but not before he received several Emmy and Golden Globe nominations. Four years later, he played an RAF officer in the BBCs Colditz, set in the German World War Two prisoner of war camp. At the end of the 70s, he teamed up with Joanna Lumley as a time-travelling agent, assigned by an unknown authority to safeguard time itself, in Sapphire  Steel. On the big screen, McCallum had roles in films including The Great Escape, The Greatest Story Ever Told and A Night to Remember. He also guest starred on TV series Perry Mason and The Outer Limits. No one did it better Born in Glasgow to parents who were classical musicians, McCallum initially pursued a career in music before finding work as an actor. In a statement released by CBS, his son Peter McCallum said: He was the kindest, coolest, most patient and loving father. He always put family before self. He was a true renaissance man - he was fascinated by science and culture and would turn those passions into knowledge. For example, he was capable of conducting a symphony orchestra and (if needed) could actually perform an autopsy, based on his decades-long studies for his role on NCIS. NCIS co-star Michael Weatherly was among the others paying tribute. Sharing a signed photo of McCallum alongside Steve McQueen in The Great Escape, Weatherly wrote: David McCallum made every moment count, in life and on set. Lets raise a jug and celebrate a funny fantastic authentic man. Ive only got three autographs. Sean Connery, Tony Bennett and McCallum, he continued. I felt the same way as Steve McQueen in this picture from The Great Escape: Wow! Its David McCallum! No one did it better. Another NCIS actor, Wilmer Valderama, shared a still of himself acting opposite McCallum, noting it had been an immense honour to share the screen with him. Your professionalism and ability to effortlessly take every one of us on a journey through your art will be felt forever, he wrote. Emily Wickersham added on her Instagram story: Had the pleasure of working with David for many years and he was the utmost professional and a true legend. McCallums role on NCIS came after he appeared for a role in the show JAG, which led to the NCIS spin-off. NCIS itself later went on to generate other NCIS shows, including NCIS: Los Angeles and NCIS: New Orleans. McCallum also found work as a voice actor for childrens cartoons and video games.

        "title": "Canadas House Speaker apologises for honouring Ukrainian who fought for Nazis",
        "date": "September 26, 2023 03:19 pm",
        "content": "The Speaker of Canadas House of Commons, Anthony Rota, has apologised for praising a Ukrainian man who served in a Nazi unit during World War Two. Yaroslav Hunka, 98, was sitting in the gallery and got a standing ovation in parliament after Mr Rota said he was a hero during a visit by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Canadian Jewish group CIJA said it was deeply troubled that a former member of a Nazi division that participated in the genocide of Jews had been celebrated. It said this should never happen again. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was with Mr Zelensky in parliament at the time. Mr Trudeau called the invite deeply embarrassing on Monday, but he did not call for Mr Rota to resign. Its extremely upsetting that this happened. The Speaker has acknowledged his mistake and has apologized, Mr Trudeau said. But this is something that is deeply embarrassing to the Parliament of Canada and by extension to all Canadians. Thousands of Ukrainians fought on the German side during the war, but millions more served in the Soviet Red Army. In a statement, Mr Rota said that on 22 September in my remarks following the address of the president of Ukraine, I recognised an individual in the gallery. I have subsequently become aware of more information which causes me to regret my decision to do so. Mr Rota said that no one, including fellow parliamentarians and the Ukraine delegation, was aware of my intention or of my remarks before I delivered them. This initiative was entirely my own, the individual in question being from my riding district and having been brought to my attention. I particularly want to extend my deepest apologies to Jewish communities in Canada and around the world. I accept full responsibility for my actions, the speaker said. Responding to his statement, CIJA said: We appreciate the apology issued... Proper vetting is imperative to ensure such an unacceptable incident does not occur again. Meanwhile, Canadas opposition Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre said Prime Minister Trudeau was also responsible for the incident, calling for him to apologise. But the office of Mr Trudeau, who heads the Liberal party, said the decision to invite Mr Hunka had been made by the Speakers office alone, and the apology was the right thing to do. No advance notice was provided to the Prime Ministers Office, nor the Ukrainian delegation, about the invitation or the recognition, said the Prime Ministers office in a statement. Mr Trudeaus office also denied allegations that a private meeting took place between Mr Hunka and the prime minister. At one point, Mr Rota pointed to Mr Hunka who sat in the gallery, saying the man was a Ukrainian hero, a Canadian hero, and we thank him for all his service. Those present in the building responded with applause. Mr Rota has faced calls from fellow parliamentarians to resign, while others criticised Mr Trudeau for not being involved in the decision to invite Mr Hunka. It is shocking that members of parliament rose to give him an ovation, Peter Julian, a member of parliament for the New Democratic Party, said in the House of Commons on Monday. Members did so because we took the Speakers word that this individual should indeed be granted this honour in good faith. Russia has criticised Canadas invitation to Mr Hunka. On Monday, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov called it outrageous. Many Western countries, including Canada, have raised a young generation that does not know who fought whom or what happened during the Second World War. And they know nothing about the threat of fascism, Mr Peskov said. President Vladimir Putin of Russia has sought to justify his invasion of Ukraine by falsely claiming Russia wants to denazify the country. During World War Two, Mr Hunka served in the 14th Waffen-SS Grenadier Division, also known as the Galicia Division - a voluntary unit made up mostly of ethnic Ukrainians under Nazi command. Division members are accused of killing Polish and Jewish civilians, although the unit has not been found guilty of any war crimes by a tribunal. The unit was renamed the First Ukrainian Division before surrendering to the Western Allies in 1945. Dominique Arel, chair of Ukrainian studies at the University of Ottawa, told CBC News that the division Mr Hunka was part of had attracted thousands of Ukrainian volunteers, many joining with hopes they could achieve Ukrainian independence.

The Commissioner General of Excise has taken necessary measures to suspend the suspected officers, on the directives of Finance State Minister Ranjith Siyambalapitiya. Siyambalapitiya has given further instructions to take legal action against these officers regardless of their ranks.

They had initially threatened to file a case against the Beedi manufacturer for his failure to renew the license, but they had later demanded a bribe of Rs. 1.4 million to resolve the matter without going to court. On account of the Beedi manufacturers refusal to pay the bribe, the excise officers had abducted him in a three-wheeler and assaulted him, before robbing him of Rs. 1 million. The assault was captured in a nearby CCTV. Tangalle crimes investigation unit had initiated investigations into the incident after a complaint was filed before the Walasmulla police.

The former minister also stressed the importance of the government taking decisive measures concerning officials who are not actively contributing to the growth of the states tax revenue. Speaking on the meeting held between the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and President Ranil Wickremesinghe this afternoon, Aluthgamage assured that the meeting yielded remarkable results He further noted that following the discussion, the government has committed to reducing inflation to single digits, bolstering foreign reserves and increasing government tax revenue. The parliamentarian made these statements during his participation in a press conference held at the Presidential Media Centre today (26 Sep.), under the theme Collective Path to a stable country.. Expressing his views further, Mr. Aluthgamage said; A pivotal meeting took place with President Ranil Wickremesinghe and representatives from the International Monetary Fund. These discussions yielded remarkable results. Today, they are scheduled to update the nation on the progress made in line with the governments agreement with the International Monetary Fund. The International Monetary Fund has emphasized three key points in their discussions. Accordingly, the government has committed to reducing inflation to single digits, bolstering foreign reserves and increasing government tax revenue. Notably, food inflation, which previously stood at 95, has now dipped to -5. Overall inflation has decreased from 70 to a mere 2.6, while foreign reserves have shrunk from 20 million to 4 billion. However, the primary focus of the International Monetary Fund remains on boosting government revenue, primarily due to the fact that 90 of government income is derived from taxes. The government has set ambitious revenue targets, including Rs. 3101 billion from the Inland Revenue Department, Rs. 1217 billion from Sri Lanka Customs, and Rs. 217 billion from the Excise Department. Unfortunately, the current figures fall short of these expectations, with the Inland Revenue Department collecting Rs. 956 billion, Sri Lanka Customs contributing Rs. 578 billion and the Excise Department generating Rs. 109 billion, totalling only Rs. 1643 billion. It is apparent that reaching the governments revenue target is a challenging task. To address this, a committee has thoroughly examined the possibility of attaining the governments revenue goal. The committee has invited the Inland Revenue Department, Customs and Excise Department, which are the primary contributors to government revenue, to discuss strategies for proper tax collection. Had these institutions implemented effective tax collection plans in 2022, they might have achieved the targeted income. In 2022, the total number of personal tax files recorded stood at 292,000. Remarkably, in a country with a population of 22 million, this number represents just 290,000 tax files, meaning that only 10 of the eligible taxes have been paid through these files. Furthermore, there are 105,000 registered companies, but only 15 of them are contributing to tax revenue. Astonishingly, a significant 86 of the governments revenue is sourced from a mere 494 companies. To manage this critical task, the Inland Revenue Department employs 2,500 individuals, and these 494 institutions account for 86 of the countrys primary revenue. Addressing irregularities within these institutions could potentially boost revenue by an impressive 500 billion. Notably, the Customs Department faces a daily loss of Rs.1 billion, totalling Rs. 180 billion in losses annually. Similarly, due to inefficiencies and irregularities, the Sri Lanka Customs incurs a yearly loss of Rs. 360 billion, while the Excise Department loses Rs. 60 million each year. One notable example is the liquor industry, which produces 50 million bottles of liquor monthly, adding up to 540-600 million bottles annually. However, a substantial 40 of this production disappears off the books, with no state tax being collected on it. In 2018, a sticker unit was introduced to enhance revenue collection. Initially, it led to an increase in government revenue, but it subsequently declined by 40 due to the proliferation of fake stickers. After the Excise Department was summoned before the committee, more than 40,000 counterfeit liquor bottles were seized. The inefficiencies of these institutions are often attributed to politicians by the public. Therefore, it is crucial to monitor and implement effective programs to enhance government revenue. The Inland Revenue Department faces the daunting task of collecting Rs. 904 billion in taxes alone. Sri Lanka is unique in allowing individuals to submit four appeals without paying taxes to the government. It takes 15 years to process these appeals, causing significant delays in revenue collection. Therefore, there is a pressing need to establish a dedicated unit to oversee and regulate these institutions. The committee has submitted a report to President Ranil Wickremesinghe in this regard. Despite the announcement of opening 1 million new tax files after a tax increase, only 10,000 new files are expected to materialize. Unfortunately, there hasnt been a noticeable increase in government revenue. Several major institutions and businessmen in the country escape the scrutiny of the Inland Revenue Department and evade paying taxes. It is imperative for the department to develop a comprehensive program to address these issues. Government revenue plays a vital role in providing subsidies, funding development activities and paying government employee salaries. The Inland Revenue Department should reconsider its approach to boosting tax revenue and it is high time for the government to take decisive action to rectify the tax collection systems shortcomings.",

        "content": "The makers of British television network Channel 4s documentary on the 2019 Easter Sunday terror attacks in Sri Lanka have admitted that they do not have credible evidence to support the claims made by Azad Maulana, the whistleblower who made serious allegations about the complicity of state officials. This came to light during a recent event in Geneva, attended by the documentarys Director Thom Walker and Executive Producer Ben de Pear. On September 06, Channel 4 aired a controversial documentary containing startling accusations relating to the bombings on Easter Sunday 2019 which targeted several Catholic churches and luxury hotels in Sri Lanka. The carnage claimed the lives of more than 260 people and left hundreds of others wounded. Channel 4s latest Dispatches investigation titled Sri Lankas Easter Bombings is a nearly 50-minute-long video with serious, yet straightforward allegations about the attacks. It was based on the testimonies of high-placed whistleblowers who alleged that senior governmental officials were complicit in this heinous act. The main whistleblower Hanzeer Azad Maulana was a spokesman for LTTEs breakaway group Tamil Makkal Viduthalai Pullikal (TMVP) led by current State Minister of Rural Road Development Sivanesathurai Chandrakanthan alias Pillayan. According to the documentary, Azad Maulana had witnessed a meeting in Puttalam in 2018, between the suicide bombers and a top Sri Lankan intelligence officer, which was aimed at hatching a plot to create insecurity in the country to pave the way for former president Gotabaya Rajapaksa to win the presidential election later in 2019. However, the founder of UK-based documentary production company Basement Films, Thom Walker has said he does not have any evidence of a prior meeting between Zahran Hashim and Suresh Sallay. Walker added that he did not know if Maulana had direct contact with Zahran. He said he had no evidence of any prior meeting between Zahran and Sallay. Walker also mentioned that he did not know if Sallay had necessarily attended the said meeting.",

Citing the provisional data released by Sri Lanka Customs, the EDB said it is, however, a 10.91  decrease when compared to the value recorded in August 2022. The decline in merchandise exports is due to decreased demand for export products, particularly in sectors such as apparel and textiles, rubber and rubber-based products, and coconut and coconut-based products. The EDB further mentioned that for the period of January to August 2023, overall merchandise exports have decreased by 10.42 to USD 7,983.13 million compared to the corresponding period of 2022. Meanwhile, out of the top 10 export markets, India, Italy, the UAE and France have shown strong performance during the month of August 2023 and the period of January-August 2023 compared to the corresponding period in the previous year. Exports to the USA, Sri Lankas single largest export destination, have meanwhile decreased 21.29 to USD 252.13 million in August 2023 compared to August 2022.

        "date": "September 26, 2023 11:55 pm",
        "content": "The International Monetary Fund is concerned about a shortfall in revenue collection by Sri Lankas government this year, though that is unlikely to derail a 2.9 billion loan programme for the crisis-hit country, two Sri Lankan sources told Reuters. A delegation from the IMF met with Sri Lankan President Ranil Wickremesinghe, who is also the finance minister, and its central bank governor, earlier on Tuesday as part of the first review of the four-year loan deal agreed in March. Such reviews are necessary to continue the programme, which is critical for the country that is slowly recovering from its worst economic crisis in at least seven decades. Sri Lanka has met most of the requirements needed to fulfil the first review. This includes progress on domestic debt restructuring, said one of the sources, who are both government officials and declined to be named. But there were concerns on Sri Lankas revenue shortfall for this year. They are likely to conduct further deliberations with Washington and then see how to move forward. Sri Lankas junior finance minister, Ranjith Siyambalapitiya, told reporters last week that the shortfall could be about 100 billion rupees (about 312 million). The target for the government was to increase revenue to 11.3 of gross domestic product in 2023 from 8.3 last year. The IMF, Sri Lankas central bank and finance ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The team from the global lender will hold a press conference in Colombo on Wednesday afternoon at the end of its two-week visit to the island nation of 22 million. Sri Lanka accepted offers to exchange about 10 billion worth of defaulted local debt for new bonds, taking it a step towards meeting debt restructuring requirements ahead of the IMF review. Sri Lanka has also held multiple rounds of talks with bondholders and bilateral creditors including Japan, China and India to reach an agreement to rework its foreign debt after suspending repayments in May last year.

Nineveh Deputy Governor Hassan al-Allaq told Reuters that 113 people had been confirmed dead, with state media putting the death toll at at least 100, with 150 people injured. The fire ripped through a large events hall in the north-eastern region after fireworks were lit during the celebration, local civil defence said, according to state media. We saw the fire pulsating, coming out of the hall. Those who managed got out and those who didnt got stuck. Even those who made their way out were broken, said Imad Yohana, a 34-year-old who escaped the inferno. Video from a Reuters correspondent at the site showed firefighters clambering over the charred wreckage of the building, shining lights over smouldering ruins. Preliminary information indicated that the building was made of highly flammable construction materials, contributing to its rapid collapse, state media said. Ambulances and medical crews were dispatched to the site by federal Iraqi authorities and Iraqs semi-autonomous Kurdistan region, according to official statements. Eyewitnesses at the site said the building caught fire at around 10:45 p.m. local time (1945 GMT) and that hundreds of people were in attendance at the time of the incident.

        "date": "September 27, 2023 02:45 pm",
        "content": "Some members on the committee of Sri Lankas official creditors are pushing to reach a deal to restructure the nations debt without the participation of China, Bloomberg News reported on Wednesday citing people familiar with the matter. The members want the group of major creditors, including the US, Japan and India, to sign a memorandum of understanding with Sri Lanka around the time of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank meetings scheduled for next month in Marrakesh, Morocco, said the people, who asked not to be identified as the discussions are private. China, which held about 10 of Sri Lankas external debt as of the end of last year, isnt a part of the group and is pursuing separate bilateral talks. Before the Marrakesh gathering, key debt holders excluding China are planning on putting together the draft outline and getting Sri Lankas consent, the people said, adding that some discord remains within the group. An official at the Paris Club, one of the largest debt holders, said a timeline for the agreement could not be confirmed. Representatives at the IMFs Colombo office werent immediately available for response. All creditors are engaging positively with us, Shehan Semasinghe, Sri Lankas junior finance minister, said by phone when asked about the development. It remains unclear whether the creditors have lost patience with China or if the move is a negotiating tactic to pressure Beijing to get on board. Although Sri Lanka is a relatively small economy, its debt restructuring is seen as a test case for Chinese participation in sovereign debt overhauls. Proceeding without China  the worlds largest sovereign creditor  would mark a setback for global efforts to get President Xi Jinpings government to join a new international system to provide relief to indebted countries that have already dragged on for almost two years. A combination of the debt hangover from the pandemic, a rising dollar and soaring US interest rates has left a growing number of poor countries without the means to pay off what they owe and in need of international help. How China will react to the deal remains to be seen. In the past China has quietly negotiated its own opaque restructurings with its debtors, often without providing any meaningful long-term relief. I would re-emphasize that China supports domestic financial institutions to negotiate a settlement agreement with Sri Lanka, Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman Wang Wenbin said in Beijing on Tuesday. Sri Lanka stands to benefit from any deal with creditors, even if China is excluded. The IMFs first on-site review of the countrys 3 billion bailout program ends Wednesday, and an agreement on debt restructuring would give hope that the South Asian nations recovery from an unprecedented economic crisis will get a boost before the multilateral lender gives its conclusion later this year. Among the creditors, Paris Club members accounted for 4.8 billion, or more than 10 of Sri Lankas external debt, according to IMF data as of year end. Thats slightly higher than China, which stands at 4.5 billion, while India is owed 1.8 billion. The Paris Club is an informal group of official creditors that help coordinate repayments for struggling debtor nations, and is currently comprised of 22 members including France, Japan, the UK and the US. Depending on how talks with official creditors progress, Sri Lanka could also make headway in its negotiations with private lenders. In July, Foreign Minister Ali Sabry said private creditors had almost agreed to a 30 haircut. A successful restructuring will assist Sri Lanka in regaining a measure of investor confidence after the nation fell into default for the first time in its history last year. It would also help the island nation make its debt more sustainable as envisaged in the IMF bailout secured in March, and enable a flow of funding. If the IMFs review is favorable, it should pave the way toward Sri Lanka getting 330 million of disbursement from the IMF, the second installment from the bailout agreement.

        "title": "Despite early signs of stabilization, full economic recovery not yet assured: IMF delegation concludes Sri Lanka visit",
        "date": "September 27, 2023 03:55 pm",
        "content": "Speaking at a press briefing in Colombo concluding a visit for the First Review of the program under the EFF arrangement, an IMF delegation warned that despite early signs of stabilization, full economic recovery is not yet assured and that sustaining the reform momentum is critical to put Sri Lankas economy on a path towards lasting recovery and stable growth. An International Monetary Fund (IMF) mission team led by Mr. Peter Breuer and Ms. Katsiaryna Svirydzenka visited Colombo from September 14 to 27, 2023 in order to discuss economic and financial policies to support the approval of the First Review of the program under the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) arrangement. There, the IMF team had constructive and productive discussions with the Sri Lankan authorities on economic performance and policies underpinning the first review under the IMF Extended Fund Facility (EFF) arrangement, the IMF Communications Department said in a statement issued as the conclusion of the visit on Wednesday (27). At the end of the discussions, Mr. Breuer and Ms. Svirydzenka said in a statement that the people of Sri Lanka have shown remarkable resilience and the authorities have made significant progress on important reforms. Discussions will continue towards reaching a staff-level agreement in the near term that will maintain the reform momentum needed to allow Sri Lanka to emerge from its deep economic crisis, it added. The people of Sri Lanka have shown remarkable resilience in the face of enormous challenges. Sri Lanka has made commendable progress in implementing difficult but much-needed reforms. These efforts are bearing fruit as the economy is showing tentative signs of stabilization. Inflation is down from a peak of 70 percent in September 2022 to below 2 percent in September 2023, gross international reserves increased by 1.5 billion during March-June this year, and shortages of essentials have eased. Despite early signs of stabilization, full economic recovery is not yet assured. Growth momentum remains subdued, with Q2 real GDP contracting by 3.1 percent on a year-on-year basis and high-frequency economic indicators continuing to provide mixed signals. Reserve accumulation has slowed in recent months. Sustaining the reform momentum is critical to put the economy on a path towards lasting recovery and stable and inclusive economic growth. The authorities have met the programs primary balance targets and remain committed to this important pillar of the program so as to support their efforts to restore debt sustainability, it mentioned. However, revenue mobilization gains--while improved relative to last year--are expected to fall short of initial projections by nearly 15 percent by year end. While partially due to economic factors, the onus of fiscal adjustment would fall on public expenditure if there were no efforts to recoup this shortfall. This could weaken the governments ability to provide essential public services; and undermine the path to debt sustainability. To increase revenues and signal better governance, it is important to strengthen tax administration, remove tax exemptions, and actively eliminate tax evasion. Against continued uncertainty, it also remains important to rebuild external buffers by strong reserves accumulation. Building on the Central Bank of Sri Lankas success in controlling inflation, refraining from monetary financing will help keep inflation in check. Other challenges include maintaining cost recovery of electricity pricing. The government has made steady progress on structural reforms, the statement mentioned, adding that key legislations passed in Parliament, including the new Central Bank Act and the Anti-Corruption Act, could improve governance if implemented effectively. The IMF Governance Diagnostic report would inform future reform measures to strengthen governance when published. A new welfare benefit payment scheme was enacted with new eligibility criteria that aims to improve targeting, adequacy, and coverage of social safety nets. To ensure financial stability, steps were taken on conducting bank diagnostics, developing a roadmap for addressing banking system capital and liquidity shortfalls, and improving the bank resolution framework. The authorities have also made headway on regaining debt sustainability through the execution of the domestic debt restructuring and advancing discussions with external creditors. As Sri Lanka is restructuring its public debt which is in arrears, Executive Board approval of the first program review requires the completion of financing assurances reviews. These financing assurances reviews will focus on whether adequate progress has been made with debt restructuring to give confidence that it will be concluded in a timely manner and in line with the programs debt targets. Discussions are on-going, and the authorities are continuing to make progress on their plans for revenue mobilization targets, anti-corruption efforts, and other important structural reforms, it said. The IMF team held meetings with President and Finance Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, Central Bank of Sri Lanka Governor Dr. P. Nandalal Weerasinghe, State Minister Mr. Shehan Semasinghe, Chief of Staff to the President Mr. Sagala Ratnayaka, Secretary to the Treasury Mr. K M Mahinda Siriwardana, and other senior government and CBSL officials. The IMF team also met with Parliamentarians, representatives from the private sector, civil society organizations, and development partners. Furthermore, the IMF teams expressed gratitude to the authorities for the excellent collaboration during the mission. The team will continue its discussions in the context of the First Review with the goal of reaching a staff-level agreement in the near term. We reaffirm our commitment to support Sri Lanka at this difficult time, it added.",

        "content": "The International Monetary Funds (IMF) Senior Mission Chief for Sri Lanka, Peter Breuer stated that there is no fixed timeline for the disbursement of the second tranche of the IMFs Extended Fund Facility (EFF) to Sri Lanka and that two important things are needed to be satisfied for the matter to be fulfilled. Theres no fixed timeline. As I mentioned, we need two important things to be satisfied. We need to reach an agreement on a set of policies and reforms that will allow us to go forward with the understanding that the objectives of the programme can be reached, he told reporters in Colombo on Wednesday (27), after a two-week visit to the country. Mr. Breuer, who mentioned that it has been discovered that there is a certain revenue shortfall in one area on which they are looking to try and find ways to address that shortfall and compensate for it, also stated that working in the direction of having an agreement on these policies is one of the most important prerequisites. The other one is in the area of debt is stable towards debt sustainability reached in agreements with creditors that will help restore debt sustainability in Sri Lanka, Mr. Breuer emphasized, adding that when these two conditions are met, we can go forward. Furthermore, the IMF Mission Chief also highlighted that there are also few administrative proceedings which will affect the timeline for the disbursement of the EFFs second tranche. It takes us some time to write the reports that actually access the performance for the first review. The report goes through various steps before it is considered by our executive board which will make the final decision on this and that finally publish that report and shared with the public, he expressed. In response to a question raised by a journalist on whether the IMFs EFF agreement with Sri Lanka could be renegotiated, Mr. Breuer asserted that renegotiating the relevant agreement is theoretically possible but it is a big undertaking. Its of course a big undertaking and indeed we would want to be sure that the objectives of the programme can still be achieved. There have been little changes to the programme where the same objectives can be achieved in different ways. It is indeed this is what about we do on an ongoing basis, he mentioned. For example during this review, making sure that the policies we agreed at the beginning are still the appropriate policies or do adjustments are needed to be made as we go long, Breuer said, adding that in a way, the programmes are dynamic and do this all the time anyway.",

        "date": "September 27, 2023 08:02 pm",
        "content": "Minister of State for Tourism Diana Gamage announced plans to launch promotional campaigns aimed at attracting 1.5 million foreign tourists to Sri Lanka by the years end. She emphasized the governments commitment to ensuring the safety of tourists and mentioned initiatives such as establishing taxi associations to enhance the visitor experience, the Presidents Media Division (PMD) reported. Speaking at a press conference themed Collective path to a stable country at the Presidential Media Centre today (27), Minister Diana Gamage also highlighted the transformation of high-tourist-traffic cities into vibrant, non-stop destinations, the PMD said. Mrs. Diana Gamage who further commented said: Today, we celebrate International Tourism Day and the Ministry of Tourism has orchestrated a graceful commemoration of this occasion. In conjunction with this special day, we have proudly introduced the Jaya Sri Lanka award, which recognizes the exceptional culinary expertise of Dr. Pabilis Silva, a journey that took him from humble beginnings to the prestigious position of head chef at the Mount Lavinia Hotel. This award holds great significance, underscoring the importance of acknowledging the often-overlooked profession of chefs in our nation. In comparison to the previous year, we have witnessed a remarkable surge in tourist arrivals during the first nine months of this year, with approximately one million foreign visitors gracing our shores. We hold high expectations that this number will soar to 1.5 million by year-end, and accordingly, we have charted out plans for special promotional events to attract even more tourists. With the onset of winter in Europe just two months away, we anticipate a substantial influx of tourists during the final months of the year. Our aim is to draw a significant number of visitors from European countries, including England. Furthermore, we are actively working on enticing tourists from Middle Eastern nations, with an expected influx as early as next month. Our ministry is diligently planning tailored promotional campaigns to engage these markets effectively. Ensuring the convenience and satisfaction of tourists is paramount. Particularly in popular destinations like Ella, Nuwara Eliya, Galle and Colombo, we are committed to providing essential night-time facilities to cater to their needs. We also aspire to transform tourist-centric cities into vibrant, 247 hubs by revising certain regulations to facilitate tourist spending. Our goal is to create an environment where tourists are encouraged to contribute to our nations economic growth. Moreover, our responsibility extends to the safety of tourists. To address this, stringent legal actions will be taken against local businesses engaging in unfair and illegal pricing practices targeting tourists. We encourage foreign visitors to act as if they plan to return to our country, fostering a positive and respectful atmosphere. Additionally, we are in the process of establishing taxi associations to enhance the convenience and safety of tourists, thus curbing illegal activities. The Ministry of Tourism is fully dedicated to this cause and has placed it under its special attention. The Cabinet has granted approval for the hemp cultivation proposal, aimed at bolstering the countrys foreign exchange reserves. Consequently, it is anticipated that the corresponding official gazette notification will be issued within the next two weeks. This initiative is not merely intended to generate revenue in rupees but rather to establish a framework that generates income in dollars. To achieve this goal, the establishment of an authoritative body is envisaged, operating within investment promotion zones under a comprehensive regulatory framework.",

        "title": "In a landmark court case, 6 young climate activists take on 32 European nations",
        "date": "September 27, 2023 09:30 pm",
        "content": "Six young adults and children argued that governments across Europe arent doing enough to protect people from climate change at the European Court of Human Rights on Wednesday in the latest and largest instance of activists taking governments to court to force climate action. Legal teams for the 32 nations  which includes the 27 EU member countries, the United Kingdom, Switzerland, Norway, Russia and Turkey  questioned the admissibility of the case as well as the claim that the plaintiffs are victims of climate change harm. But lawyers representing the group from Portugal said the nations theyre suing have failed to adequately address human-caused warming and therefore violated some of the groups fundamental rights. They insisted on the need for further and rapid action to meet climate targets that have been set for the end of the decade. Todays case is about the young. It is about the price that they are paying for the failure of states to tackle the climate emergency. It is about the harm that they will suffer during their lifetimes unless states step up to their responsibilities, said Alison Macdonald, pleading on behalf of the young people. Barrister Sudhanshu Swaroop, a counsel for United Kingdom, said national governments understand the threat of climate change and its challenges and are determined to tackle it through international cooperation. He said the plaintiffs should have gone through national courts first, and stressed that since they are not nationals of the countries they are attacking, other than Portugal, the European Court of Human Rights cannot have jurisdiction. But Macdonald told the judges about the urgency to tackle the biggest crisis that Europe and the world have perhaps faced, and that countries should play a bigger role in helping control planet-warming emissions. It cannot be within a states discretion whether or not to act to prevent catastrophic climate destruction, she said. Although there have been successful climate cases at national and regional levels  young environmentalists recently won a similar case in Montana  the activists legal team said that because national jurisdictions did not go far enough to protect their rights, the group felt compelled to take the matter to the Strasbourg-based court. Arguing that their rights to life, to privacy and family life, and to be free from discrimination are being violated, the plaintiffs hope a favorable ruling will force governments to accelerate their climate efforts. Weve put forward evidence to show that its within the power of states to do vastly more to adjust their emissions, and they are choosing not do it, lawyer Gerry Liston told The Associated Press at the beginning of the day-long hearing. The courts rulings are legally binding on member countries, and failure to comply makes authorities liable for hefty fines decided by the court. Liston said a ruling in favor of the group would also help future climate cases taken at domestic level by providing guidance to national courts. But the plaintiffs  who are between 11 and 24 years of age and are not seeking financial compensation  will need to convince judges that they have been sufficiently affected to be considered as victims and prove that governments have a legal duty to make sure global warming is held to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) since pre-industrial times in line with the goals of the 2015 Paris climate agreement. We have put forward evidence before the court that all of the respondents state climate policies are aligned to 3 degrees (Celsius) of warming within the lifetime of the applicants, or in the case of some states, worse than that, Liston said. No state has put forward evidence to counter that position. But the director of the European Commission legal service, speaking on behalf of the EUs executive arm as a third party intervener in the case, defended the blocs climate action. The EU is going beyond the obligations of the Paris agreement, said Daniel Calleja Crespo, citing the EUs target of reducing net greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55 by 2030, and the goal of reaching climate neutrality by 2050, where most emissions are slashed and those remaining are canceled out. The world is way off track on limiting warming to 1.5 C, scientists say, with global average temperatures projected to rise by 2 to 4 degrees C (2.6 to 7.2 F) by 2100 on current trajectories of warming and emissions reductions plans. The activists said climate change affects their daily lives and their studies, and damages both their physical and psychological well-being. They started judicial action in the wake of a series of deadly wildfires in central Portugal in 2017, where four of them live. Its 43 degrees (109 F) one day, and the next its hail, and thats dangerous because we cant predict whats going to happen, said 15-year-old André Oliveira, adding that the heat wave that hit Portugal in May hindered his schoolwork. One of the judges asked the applicants to provide more details about how their quality of life has been affected. Macdonald mentioned their fatigue, their difficulty in sleeping, the impact on their mental abilities and the increasing difficulty for them to enjoy time outside of their homes. Representing Portugal, Ricardo Matos questioned the victim status of the applicants, arguing that they have not established a direct link between states emissions and the harm suffered because of the wildfires in their country. Matos insisted that because climate change has an impact on everyone, no one should be allowed victim status. Its the first climate case to be filed with the court. Two other climate cases  one by an association of Swiss senior women against Switzerland, the other by a French lawmaker against France  have been brought before the court since. Members of the Swiss association traveled to Strasbourg in support of the young Portuguese. They stood in front of the courthouse before the hearing, alongside a few dozens of other supporters. I wish them a future, because they are very young, said Anne Mahrer, the groups co-president. We probably wont be there to see it, but if we win, everybody wins. A decision is not expected for several months. Its still unclear whether the court will deliver its ruling on all three climate cases at the same time. Source - The Associated Press --Agencies",

        "title": "Global backing for Presidents 2048 Green Economy Initiative Funding  Dr. Anil Jasinghe",
        "date": "September 27, 2023 09:57 pm",
        "content": "The Secretary of the Ministry of Environment, Dr. Anil Jasinghe, announced that Sri Lanka has formally committed to providing the essential funding for President Ranil Wickremesinghes 2048 Green Economy Programme. He also noted that, thanks to the Presidents advocacy in international conferences and meetings with world leaders, several nations have swiftly expressed their interest in these agreements, the Presidents Media Division (PMD) reported. Furthermore, Dr. Anil Jasinghe underscored the significance of the Joint Crediting Mechanism (JCM), which serves as a gateway for collaboration with the Japanese government and the private sector in green initiatives. Dr. Anil Jasinghe shared these insights during his recent appearance on the 101 Katha programme, produced by the Presidential Media Division. He elaborated on how Sri Lanka, under the Presidents leadership, was able to establish agreements with Singapore, including the innovative concept of carbon credits, the PMD said in a statement. Additionally, Dr. Anil Jasinghe highlighted that the Sri Lankan government, in partnership with the international community, is actively taking measures to reduce the impact of climate change. These measures aim to provide relief to those affected by natural disasters, including farmers. Moreover, he disclosed that, in line with President Ranil Wickremesinghes directives, cooperation with neighbouring countries is anticipated to secure the necessary funds for addressing climate change-related challenges like droughts and floods, it added. Dr. Jasinghe further said; In the past, weather patterns followed a certain predictable cycle, with occurrences like rains, floods and droughts adhering to established norms. However, the emergence of climate change has disrupted this pattern, introducing an unpredictable element. If this trend continues unchecked, we can anticipate a rise in both weather and climate fluctuations, leading to an increase in natural disasters. The industrial revolution triggered the gradual escalation of fossil fuel consumption, which has now reached its zenith. Among the pollutants released, carbon dioxide emissions are identified as the primary driver of climate change. Consequently, we are witnessing global temperature rises, the melting of glaciers, sea-level elevation, and shifts in climate zones across different countries. This translates to amplified rainfall in already high-rainfall areas and exacerbated droughts in arid regions, causing significant alterations in biodiversity. For countries like Sri Lanka, the impact is disproportionately severe. While our contribution to fossil fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions is minuscule on the international scale, environmental effects know no borders. As an island nation and a small country, we bear the brunt of the consequences caused by the activities of larger nations more than they do. If left unaddressed, projections indicate that certain areas of the Jaffna Peninsula may become submerged by 2090, with the intrusion of saltwater severely affecting agriculture. Internationally, countries collaborate through initiatives like the Climate Change Conference (COP) to combat climate change. Each nation presents its National Determined Contributions to tackle climate change. Our focus must centre on disaster mitigation, resilience-building in the face of calamities and disaster response strategies. Sri Lanka has the potential to pivot toward renewable energy sources such as solar, hydro and wind power, thus curbing greenhouse gas emissions. At a recent climate change conference in Egypt, President Ranil Wickremesinghe unveiled this strategy as the Climate Prosperity Plan. Smaller nations, including our own, diligently lobbied powerful governments to make substantial financial contributions aimed at instigating transformative change in addressing climate change. President Ranil Wickremesinghe consistently championed this cause not only at this conference but also on various international platforms. After years of tireless efforts, a committee has been convened to present a report concerning the establishment of an international fund to address climate-related disasters at the United Arab Emirates Climate Change Conference scheduled for next December. Various mechanisms for financing climate change mitigation have surfaced. The largest fund globally designated for this purpose is the Global Climate Fund, operating within the United Nations Climate Change Framework System. Prominent nations worldwide pledged an annual addition of 100 billion each, a promise they have regrettably failed to fulfil. Furthermore, alternate means of financing our climate action and renewable energy endeavours exist, such as carbon finance. This carbon mechanism was adopted by all 194 countries worldwide several years ago, with President Ranil Wickremesinghe taking the lead in initiatives to generate income for our nation through this mechanism. Under this framework, Sri Lanka and Japan entered into an agreement known as the Joint Crediting Mechanism (JCM). This agreement involves Japanese companies collaborating with Sri Lankan counterparts to invest in projects aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions, with contributions from both Japanese companies and the Japanese government. Primarily, these investments focus on the renewable energy sector, reducing reliance on fossil fuels like diesel. This initiative has given rise to the concept of carbon trading, which has gained significant traction. Through the JCM, we have gained access to financial resources, technology and capacity building through Japanese investments. This provides us with the opportunity to obtain long-term economic benefits without the need for power plants, technology, or the burning of fossil fuels. Simultaneously, our Japanese partners receive a share of the profits from carbon trading as they invest in these projects. Currently, two projects are under discussion within the JCM framework. Additionally, our agreement with Singapore includes methods for greenhouse gas absorption. At the directive of President Ranil Wickremesinghe, we are actively engaged as a climate justice collective at the COP 28 summit, advocating for the comprehensive loss and damage fund and his proposal to establish an international university focused on climate change. President Ranil Wickremesinghes proposal encompasses all aspects of formulating a National Climate Change Act. A committee has been tasked with crafting a new environmental act that aligns with the contemporary worlds priorities, with an emphasis on climate change. These initiatives are also integrated into the National Environmental Action Plan developed approximately two years ago. All these endeavours are intended to be executed in a legal, transparent and meticulously structured manner, ensuring maximum benefits with minimal drawbacks. Its imperative to emphasize that all these investments are directed toward environmental preservation and nothing else. The more we safeguard the environment, the better equipped we are to mitigate the challenges and disasters stemming from climate change. This approach yields benefits across various sectors, including agriculture and fishing.",

        "title": "Danushka Gunathilaka found not guilty of sexual assault",
        "date": "September 28, 2023 08:07 am",
        "content": "Sri Lankan cricketer Danushka Gunathilaka has been found not guilty of sexual intercourse without consent following an accusation of stealthing involving a Tinder date in Sydney. The 32-year-old was arrested in November while in Australia for the T-20 World Cup, after he went for drinks with a woman near the Opera House. He had chatted online for several days and then had dinner with the woman, who cant be identified for legal reasons, before being invited back to her eastern suburbs home, the NSW District Court heard. The Crowns case was that he removed a condom during intercourse without the womans knowledge when she had consented only to protected sex. The complainant told the court she did not see the batsman remove the condom, but saw it on the floor shortly after the intercourse stopped. Woman gave two different accounts Judge Sarah Huggett today found evidence about the genesis of the womans complaint undermined the reliability of her evidence. The judge said the woman had given different accounts in her two statements; the second, given in April this year, went into further detail about the issue of stealthing. But the judge said the complainant did not have a clear memory of what happened around the time she saw the condom on the floor. The evidence establishes there was no opportunity for the accused to remove the condom during the intercourse because that intercourse was continuous, she said. Judge Huggett considered the womans first conversations with two close friends, which seemed to frame the complaint in terms of the roughness of the sexual activity. Crown failed to establish womans reliability Mr Gunathilakas defence counsel argued the woman lied, gave self-serving evidence and appeared to not remember parts of the night that were inconsistent with a narrative she created, which morphed over time. Murugan Thangaraj SC told the judge the Crown failed to establish the womans reliability and highlighted what he said were inconsistencies and implausibility in her version of events. He said it was completely illogical to claim she felt ambushed before lighting candles in her bedroom, effectively setting it up for a romantic sexual liaison. In court, the woman alleged Mr Gunathilaka kissed her forcefully on the way home and on her couch, where she felt ambushed before moving to the bedroom. She further alleged he choked her three times during sex, leaving her fearful for her life, and ignored requests to go slow. Judge Huggett found the woman was an intelligent witness who gave evidence in a considered way, and was overall a calm and responsive witness. But the judge said there were times when it appeared the complainant was motivated by a desire to paint the accused in an unfavourable light. Police interview played in court In his police interview, Mr Gunathilaka said he told her his preference generally was to not use condoms but wanted to on the night because it was their first meeting. In the interview, the cricketer made mention of there being two condoms because one malfunctioned  which the Crown said was a deliberate mistruth. But Judge Huggett disagreed, finding that his answers were the result of confusion, fatigue, a language barrier and possibly memory. I formed the distinct impression he was doing his best to be truthful and assist the police, she said. Sitting in the interview room, Mr Gunathilaka told police the woman had organised him a taxi and he kissed her before leaving. She didnt even text me, I didnt text her also, he said. And thats it, then Im here. Mr Gunathilaka has been in Australia on bail since mid-November. Outside court, Mr Gunathilaka said the verdict says everything and that his reputation had been restored. He thanked his lawyers, manager, as well as friends and family back in Sri Lanka, saying everyone believed me, so that means a lot to me. Im happy that my life is normal again, so I cant wait to go back and play cricket, he said. Mr Gunathilaka said the last eleven months have been really hard, particularly being in Australia without his parents. Source: ABC News -Agencies",

Until these recalled vehicles have been repaired... the safest place to park them is outside and away from homes and other structures, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said in a statement. Fires can occur whether the vehicle is parked and turned off or while driving. The vehicles in question include 1.64 million from Hyundai and Genesis, concerning 2010 to 2015 models, and 1.73 million Kias, ranging from 2010 to 2017. The problem comes from an issue with the vehicles anti-lock brake systems (ABS), which could leak brake fluid internally and cause an electrical short, the NHTSA said. Hyundai plans to notify owners to bring their vehicles to the nearest dealership to replace the ABS module fuse, the agency said. Kia is still working on a remedy. Neither company knows of any crashes, injuries or fatalities associated with this defect. Hyundai has recorded 21 vehicle fires linked to the default in the United States, as well as 22 thermal incidents, including visible smoke, burning and melting.

        "date": "September 28, 2023 04:01 pm",
        "content": "The speaker of Canadas parliament resigned on Tuesday, days after publicly celebrating a Ukrainian veteran who fought for the Nazis during World War II. During a visit to parliament by Ukraines President Volodymyr Zelensky last week, Anthony Rota hailed an elderly Ukrainian immigrant from his district as a hero, prompting a standing ovation. But Rota has faced growing pressure to resign after it was revealed that the veteran had served in a Nazi-linked military unit. It is with a heavy heart that I rise to inform members of my resignation as Speaker of the House of Commons, Rota told lawmakers from the parliamentary floor. He expressed his profound regret for my error and the pain he caused to Jewish communities in Canada and around the world. Russia has accused the government in Kyiv of espousing Nazi ideals, despite Zelensky being Jewish and losing family members in the Holocaust, and the controversy was likely to add fodder to that narrative. On Friday, Rota paid homage to Yaroslav Hunka, a 98-year-old Ukrainian immigrant who was visiting parliament and who is from Rotas electoral district. He hailed Hunka as a Ukrainian-Canadian war veteran from the Second World War who fought for Ukrainian independence against the Russians and a Ukrainian hero and a Canadian hero. But Hunka actually served in the 14th Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS, a Nazi military unit whose crimes against humanity during the Holocaust are well-documented, according to the Friends of Simon Wiesenthal Center. The Jewish advocacy group called the incident shocking and incredibly disturbing. This incident has compromised all 338 Members of Parliament, the organization said, adding it had handed a propaganda victory to Russia, distracting from what was a momentously significant display of unity between Canada and Ukraine. Deepest apologies Several political parties in Canada had urged Rota, a Liberal lawmaker, to step down. Rota, who was first elected in 2004 and became speaker in 2019, apologized on Sunday, saying that he had subsequently become aware of more information which caused him to regret his remarks about Hunka. This initiative was entirely my own... I particularly want to extend my deepest apologies to Jewish communities in Canada and around the world, he said. On Monday Prime Minister Justin Trudeau called Rotas remarks shameful. The main opposition Conservatives slammed the Trudeau administration for failing to properly vet Hunka, despite claims it had no advance notice hed been invited to the event. Zelenskys visit to Canada was the third leg in a tour aimed at bolstering international support, after addressing the United Nations and visiting US President Joe Biden in Washington. During the visit, Trudeau pledged additional aid to Zelenskys war-torn country. Canada is home to the worlds second-largest Ukrainian diaspora and Zelensky, in his speech to parliament, expressed thanks for the backing given to Kyiv since Russian troops poured over the Ukrainian borders in February 2022. Russia has accused Ukrainian leaders of being neo-Nazis and has sought to justify the war with the need to denazify its neighbor. Commenting on the issue of the Ukrainian veteran, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said such sloppiness of memory is outrageous, Russian media reported. In Poland, Education Minister Przemysław Czarnek raised the possibility of seeking Hunkas extradition. Writing on X, formerly known as Twitter, Czarnek said he had tasked the national historical research institute to see if Hunka is wanted for crimes against Poles or Polish Jews. I have taken steps towards a possible extradition of this man to Poland, Czarnek wrote. (AFP) --Agencies",

        "date": "September 28, 2023 04:10 pm",
        "content": "Hollywoods writers union said its members could return to work on Wednesday while they decide whether to approve a three-year deal that provides pay raises and some protections around use of artificial intelligence among other gains. The Writers Guild of America (WGA) leadership voted unanimously to end the strike on Wednesday, the guild said in a statement. The 11,500 members have until Oct. 9 to cast their votes on the proposed contract. The WGA said the estimated value of the deal was 233 million per year. Film and television writers walked off the job in May after failing to reach a deal with major studios, including Netflix (NFLX.O), Walt Disney (DIS.N) and Warner Bros Discovery (WBD.O). Writers appeared to have won concessions across the board, with raises over the three years of the contract, increased health and pension contributions, and AI safeguards. Under the agreement, the studios agreed to meet at least twice a year with the guild to discuss plans to use AI in film development and production. The studios are not expressly prohibited from using AI to generate content. Writers, however, have the right to sue if their work is used to train AI. Writers can choose to use AI when drafting scripts, but a company cannot require the use of the software. The studios also must disclose to a writer if any materials were generated by AI. In other areas, the guild said it won guarantees of minimum staffing in writers rooms, a key issue for many of its members. Staffing will be determined by the number of episodes per season. Minimum pay rates will climb by more than 12 over three years. Also, residuals will rise for the use of TV shows and movies outside of the United States and a bonus will be awarded for the most popular shows on streaming. These are essential protections that the companies told us, to our faces, that they would NEVER give us, writer Adam Conover, a member of the guilds negotiating committee, posted on social media platform X. But because of our solidarity, because they literally cannot make a dollar without us, they bent, then broke, and gave us what we deserve. WE WON, Conover said. Television writer David Slack said: Our strike was necessary. Our strike was effective. Our strike is a victory. The strikes end means daytime and late-night talk shows can return to the air. Bill Maher, host of HBOs Real Time, said on social media that he would be back with fresh episodes starting Friday. My writers and Real Time are back! Maher wrote. Maher and Drew Barrymore had angered writers by saying this month that their talk shows would return before the strike ended. The end of the WGA strike does not return Hollywood to normal. The SAG-AFTRA actors union walked off the job in July and remains on strike. Source - Reuters --Agencies",

        "date": "September 28, 2023 04:17 pm",
        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe says that Sri Lanka requires USD 26.5 billion by 2030 to make the countrys climate prosperity plan succeed. Addressing the Berlin Global Dialogue, President Ranil Wickremesinghe said that Sri Lanka has both climate change mitigation and debt restructuring, which we have to handle with minimum funds available. Wickremesinghe said the global economy has many shocks in the last two decades, starting from 2008. He said the global economy has gone through a series crises including the European debt crisis, the Covid-19 pandemic and the economic shocks that have come from it, the whole issue of funding for climate change and the sovereign debt crisis. I dont think in any other period of modern history have we gone through this type of a crisis. And in all these instances it is the developing economies and the Global South that has suffered disproportionately, he said. The President said we are now faced with stubbornly high inflation advance economies, oil prices edging towards USD 100 a barrel and monetary tightening by the global central banks. One example is that Sri Lankas exports to Europe have not increased at all so far this year. Thats an indication of how we are being affected as we try to recover from the crisis we face, he explained. President Wickremesinghe said the difference between the advance economies and the developing nations is that the former has all the buffers and reserves to deal with these shocks, while the latter does not. And its from here that the sovereign debt crisis started. He stated that in this context, he believes that the world may be on the scruff of another crisis if corrective measures are not taken immediately. President Ranil Wickremesinghe further said: Many developing countries find themselves with large burdens. For example, the IMF has no mechanism to face this new situation. When Sri Lanka declared bankruptcy, all foreign funding seized. And that started the political crisis. If not for the help given by the World Bank in regraduating Sri Lanka and my old friend Samantha Power (USAID Administrator) in funding us with fertilizer, I would not have been able to come here today. I would not have been in the position. Its so bad and there is no way in which you can help any country which declared bankruptcy. But in this case especially Im glad that Germany is doing its part as the largest cumulative contributor to the Green Climate Fund. We have both climate change mitigation and debt restructuring, both which we have to handle with minimum funds available. The funding on the table is woefully inadequate to address the vast challenges at hand. So we havent got any money, but we do have a 100 billion with the IMF. Lets start with that money. 100 billion is better than nothing. Then lets see how we can raise the rest of it. Because though I talk of Sri Lanka, I must say, Africas need especially of the lower-income countries are far greater than ours. And the problems Africa face need not be described by me because I think there are enough representatives here. The developing countries require financing up to US 5.9 trillion to fulfill their nationally determined contributions and then a further US 4 trillion per annum for clean energy technology to achieve net zero emissions. Look at Sri Lankas financing needs. For our climate prosperity plan to succeed, we need USD 26.5 billion by 2030. This is for a country that is bankrupt and who the IMF states will have for the next few years a growth rate of 3.5, if we are lucky. Meanwhile speaking during the Berlin Dialogue Roundtable, the Sri Lankan Head of State said that debt restructuring discussions with China so far have been positive and that they have to talk with the Paris Club and India once again.",

        "date": "September 28, 2023 05:57 pm",
        "content": "Veteran actor Michael Gambon, who was known to many for his portrayal of Hogwarts headmaster Albus Dumbledore in six of the eight Harry Potter films, has died, his publicist said Thursday. He was 82. A statement by his family, issued by his publicist, said he died following a bout of pneumonia. We are devastated to announce the loss of Sir Michael Gambon. Beloved husband and father, Michael died peacefully in hospital with his wife Anne and son Fergus at his bedside, his family said. No matter what role he took on in a career that lasted more than five decades, Gambon was always instantly recognizable by the deep and drawling tones of his voice. He was cast as the much-loved Dumbledore after the death of his predecessor, Richard Harris, in 2002. He once acknowledged not having read any of J. K. Rowlings best-selling books, arguing that it was safer to follow the script rather than be too influenced by the books. That didnt prevent him from embodying the spirit of Professor Dumbledore, the powerful wizard who fought against evil to protect his students. Although the Potter role raised Gambons international profile and introduced him to a new generation of fans, he had long been recognized as one of Britains leading actors. His work spanned TV, theater and radio, and he starred in dozens of films from Gosford Park to The Kings Speech and the animated family movie Paddington. Gambon was knighted for services to drama in 1998. Born in Ireland on Oct. 19, 1940, Gambon was raised in London and originally trained as an engineer, following in the footsteps of his father. He made his theater debut in a production of Othello in Dublin. In 1963 he got his first big break with a minor role in Hamlet, the National Theatre Companys opening production, under the directorship of the legendary Laurence Olivier. Gambon soon became a distinguished stage actor and received critical acclaim for his leading performance in Life of Galileo directed by John Dexter. He was frequently nominated for awards and won the Laurence Olivier award 3 times and the Critics Circle Theatre Awards twice. A multi-talented actor, Gambon was also the recipient of four coveted British Academy of Film and Television Arts awards for his television work. He became a household name in Britain after his lead role in the 1986 BBC series The Singing Detective, written by Dennis Potter and considered a classic of British television drama. Gambon won the BAFTA for best actor for the role. Gambon was versatile as an actor but once told the BBC of his preference for playing villainous characters. He played gangster Eddie Temple in the British crime thriller Layer Cake  a review of the film by the New York Times referred to Gambon as reliably excellent  and a Satanic crime boss in Peter Greenaways The Cook, The Thief, His Wife and Her Lover. He also had a part as King George V in the 2010 drama film The Kings Speech. In 2015 he returned to the works of J.K. Rowling, taking a leading role in the TV adaptation of her book The Casual Vacancy. Gambon retired from the stage in 2015 after struggling to remember his lines in front of an audience due to his advancing age. He once told the Sunday Times Magazine: Its a horrible thing to admit, but I cant do it. It breaks my heart. The actor was always protective when it came to his private life. He married Anne Miller and they had one son, Fergus. He later had two sons with set designer Philippa Hart. Source  The Associated Press --Agencies",

        "title": "Fitch upgrades Sri Lankas long-term local-currency IDR to CCC-",
        "date": "September 28, 2023 06:36 pm",
        "content": "Fitch Ratings has upgraded Sri Lankas Long-Term Local-Currency Issuer Default Rating (IDR) to CCC- from RD (Restricted Default). Fitch typically does not assign Outlooks to sovereigns with a rating of CCC or below. The Long-Term Foreign-Currency IDR has been affirmed at RD and the Country Ceiling at B-. The Short-Term Local-Currency IDR has been downgraded to RD from C following the exchange of treasury bills held by the central bank and subsequently upgraded to C in line with the Sovereign Rating Criteria, as we believe the local-currency debt exchange has now been completed. A full list of rating actions is at the end of this rating action commentary. KEY RATING DRIVERS Local-Currency Debt Exchange Completed: The upgrade of Sri Lankas Long-Term Local-Currency IDR to CCC- reflects the completion of the local-currency portion of Sri Lankas domestic debt optimisation (DDO) plan, launched in July 2023, following the exchange of the Central Bank of Sri Lankas (CBSL) treasury bills and provisional advance into new treasury bonds and bills on 21 September 2023. We assume the debt restructuring will lower Sri Lankas gross financing needs over the medium term, in line with the targets under the IMFs Extended Fund Facility, and support an improvement in the countrys debt metrics over time. Local-currency restructuring could accelerate progress towards the restructuring of external debt. Government Debt Remains High: General government debt and the interest costs faced by the government will remain high, despite the debt restructuring. Sri Lankas gross general government debt-to-GDP ratio is set to fall only gradually to just above 100 of GDP by 2028, from 128 of GDP in 2022, according to IMF programme forecasts published in March 2023, which incorporated a local- and foreign-currency debt restructuring scenario. The IMF scenario forecast the government interest-to- revenue ratio will decline to 42 by 2028, from over 70 in 2022. Lower Financing Needs: The authorities expect the completion of the local-currency debt exchange to lower Sri Lankas gross government financing needs (GFN)GDP by about 1.5pp over 2027-2032, according to documents published in July. External debt restructuring, which authorities expect to reduce GFN by an additional 2.6pp, remains critical to achieving the target of reducing GFN below 13 by 2027-2032, from 34 in 2022. Reduction in Terms: The DDO on the local-currency debt entailed an extension of maturities on certain categories of domestic debt and offered several options, including nominal haircuts, currency redenomination and maturity extensions. Outstanding treasury bills purchased by the CBSL in the primary market were converted into 10 step-down fixed-coupon new treasury bonds and 12 existing treasury bills. Stronger Revenue Generation Key: We believe IMF programme implementation, in particular fiscal measures, will be central to achieving debt sustainability. The risks remain significant, in our view, as a record of weak revenue generation presents challenges to achieving a faster reduction in the budget deficit and the general government debt-to-GDP ratio. Authorities have taken several tax measures since May 2022 to improve revenue collection, including raising the corporate income tax rate to 30 from 24, increasing the VAT rate to 15 from 8, and raising fuel excise taxes. This resulted in revenue collection rising 43 yoy in 1H23. Additional measures in the pipeline include removing product-specific VAT exemptions before 2024 and introducing a property tax before 2025. External Metrics Improving: Sri Lankas foreign-exchange (FX) reserves have been improving, with gross FX reserves rising to USD3.6 billion in August 2023, from USD1.9 billion at end-2022, partly the result of IMF disbursements and suspension of external debt servicing. However, without access to international capital markets, the sovereign remains dependent on official financing sources. We expect a gradual pick-up in exports in 2024-2025 after a contraction in 2023. Overseas worker remittance inflows are also rising. We therefore expect the current account deficit to stabilise at 1.6 of GDP over 2024-2025. Slow Economic Recovery: GDP contracted by 2.7 yoy in 2Q23, slowing from the 12 contraction in 1Q23. Agriculture and services grew in 2Q23, but industry continued to shrink, although at a slower pace from 1Q23. We expect GDP to contract by 1.4 yoy in 2023 before growing by 3.3 and 3.5 in 2024 and 2025, respectively. Inflation, measured by the Colombo CPI, averaged around 30 yoy until August 2023 but continued the decline from end-2022. The CBSL has cut the standing deposit facility rate by a cumulative 350bp since January 2023. We expect another rate cut before end-2023. Downside Risks to Banks Easing: The exclusion of banks holdings of treasury securities from the DDO has alleviated some of the pressure on their capital positions from weakening loan quality and rupee depreciation as well as any immediate funding and liquidity stresses. We believe any incremental risk to the banks capital from foreign-currency debt restructuring is likely to be manageable given their limited exposure to the defaulted sovereign bonds (3.6 of their combined total assets at end-1H23) and high provision coverage. Foreign-Currency IDR in Default: The sovereign remains in default on foreign-currency obligations and has initiated a debt restructuring with official and private external creditors. The Ministry of Finances statement on 12 April 2022 said it had suspended normal debt servicing of several categories of external debt, including bonds issued in international capital markets, foreign currency-denominated loans and credit facilities with commercial banks and institutional lenders. ESG - Governance: Sri Lanka has an ESG Relevance Score of 5 for Political Stability and Rights as well as for the Rule of Law, Institutional and Regulatory Quality and Control of Corruption. These scores reflect the high weight that the World Bank Governance Indicators (WBGI) have in our proprietary Sovereign Rating Model (SRM). Sri Lanka has a medium WBGI ranking in the 45th percentile, reflecting a recent record of peaceful political transitions, a moderate level of rights for participation in the political process, moderate institutional capacity, established rule of law and a moderate level of corruption. ESG - Creditor Rights: Sri Lanka has an ESG Relevance Score of 5 for Creditor Rights, as willingness to service and repay debt is highly relevant to the rating and is a key rating driver with a high weight. The affirmation of Sri Lankas Long-Term Foreign-Currency IDR at RD reflects a default event. RATING SENSITIVITIES Factors that Could, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating ActionDowngrade - The Local-Currency IDRs would be downgraded if further restructuring or a default on local-currency debt becomes probable due to an unsustainable debt burden or inability to raise revenue. - The Long-Term Foreign-Currency IDRs are at the lowest level and cannot be downgraded further. Factors that Could, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating ActionUpgrade - A sustained decline in the general government debt-to-GDP ratio that is underpinned by strong implementation of a medium-term fiscal consolidation strategy and improved growth performance. - Completion of the foreign-currency commercial debt restructuring that Fitch judges to have normalised the relationship with private-sector creditors may result in an upgrade. In accordance with the rating criteria for ratings in the CCC range and below, Fitchs sovereign rating committee has not used the SRM and QO to explain the ratings, which are instead guided by the agencys rating definitions. Fitchs SRM is the agencys proprietary multiple regression rating model that employs 18 variables based on three-year centred averages, including one year of forecasts, to produce a score equivalent to a LT FC IDR. Fitchs QO is a forward-looking qualitative framework designed to allow for adjustment to the SRM output to assign the final rating, reflecting factors within our criteria that are not fully quantifiable andor not fully reflected in the SRM. COUNTRY CEILING The Country Ceiling for Sri Lanka is B-. For sovereigns rated CCC or below, Fitch assumes a starting point of CCC for determining the Country Ceiling. Fitchs Country Ceiling Model produced a starting point uplift of zero notches. Fitchs rating committee applied a 1 notch qualitative adjustment to this, under the balance of payments restrictions pillar, reflecting that the private sector has not been prevented or significantly impeded from converting local currency into foreign currency and transferring the proceeds to non-resident creditors to service debt payments. Fitch does not assign Country Ceilings below CCC, and only assigns a Country Ceiling of CCC in the event that transfer and convertibility risk has materialised and is affecting the vast majority of economic sectors and asset classes. REFERENCES FOR SUBSTANTIALLY MATERIAL SOURCE CITED AS KEY DRIVER OF RATING The principal sources of information used in the analysis are described in the Applicable Criteria. ESG CONSIDERATIONS Sri Lanka has an ESG Relevance Score of 5 for Political Stability and Rights as WBGI have the highest weight in Fitchs SRM and are highly relevant to the rating and a key rating driver with a high weight. As Sri Lanka has a percentile rank below 50 for the respective governance indicator, this has a negative impact on the credit profile. Sri Lanka has an ESG Relevance Score of 5 for Rule of Law, Institutional  Regulatory Quality and Control of Corruption as WBGI have the highest weight in Fitchs SRM and are therefore highly relevant to the rating and are a key rating driver with a high weight. As Sri Lanka has a percentile rank below 50 for the respective governance indicators, this has a negative impact on the credit profile. Sri Lanka has an ESG Relevance Score of 4 for Human Rights and Political Freedoms, as the Voice and Accountability pillar of the WBGI is relevant to the rating and a rating driver. As Sri Lanka has a percentile rank below 50 for the respective governance indicator, this has a negative impact on the credit profile. Sri Lanka has an ESG Relevance Score of 5 for Creditor Rights as willingness to service and repay debt is highly relevant to the rating and is a key rating driver with a high weight. Sri Lankas Long-Term Foreign-Currency IDR is RD as the sovereign is in default on its foreign-currency debt obligations. The highest level of ESG credit relevance is a score of 3, unless otherwise disclosed in this section. A score of 3 means ESG issues are credit-neutral or have only a minimal credit impact on the entity, either due to their nature or the way in which they are being managed by the entity. Fitchs ESG Relevance Scores are not inputs in the rating process; they are an observation on the relevance and materiality of ESG factors in the rating decision. --Fitch Ratings--",

        "date": "September 28, 2023 07:05 pm",
        "content": "SriLankan Airlines has entered into a first-ever interline partnership with Virgin Australia that will strengthen the airlines network in Australia and offer customers extensive connections across the land down under and beyond. The new partnership reaffirms SriLankans commitment to Australia and will present customers the convenience of adding select Virgin Australia domestic or international connections to their SriLankan Airlines booking and managing a multi-airline itinerary under a single ticket, the SriLankan Airlines said in a statement. Dimuthu Tennakoon, Head of Worldwide Sales  Distribution of SriLankan Airlines commented on the partnership by stating, Australia has one of the largest Sri Lankan diasporic communities, which makes our Australian routes incredibly popular all year around and particularly with people travelling to visit friends and relatives or in pursuit of higher education. This partnership will help us make further inroads in the Australian market through improved connectivity and a range of other benefits for our valued customers. SriLankan Airlines currently operates daily from Colombo to Melbourne and from Colombo to Sydney on a thrice-weekly basis. The partnership will enable passengers flying SriLankan to Melbourne or Sydney to connect to the Australian cities of Adelaide, Brisbane, Canberra, Cairns, Darwin, Hobart, Hamilton Island, Launceston, Gold Coast and Perth with Virgin Australia. Passengers will also have the option of flying beyond Australia to New Zealand, Samoa and Fiji. It is a win for Sri Lankan and Indian Australians living in these cities too as they can now fly out from their local city to Sri Lanka or India with a single SriLankan Airlines booking. Whats more, passengers can enjoy a seamless journey with a single check-in, including for baggage, at the departure airport and beat transit check-in queues. The introduction of domestic and international interline flights options with Virgin Australia would improve the accessibility to Sri Lanka for Australian outbound tourists as well. An important customer group for SriLankan, the partnership will unquestionably help develop Australian leisure travel to Sri Lanka. It will also provide easy connections for SriLankan Airlines passengers flying to Australia via Colombo from the Maldives, India, Nepal, Pakistan and Bangladesh, the statement added. Since relaunching flights to Melbourne in October 2017 and Sydney in June 2020, close to a million passengers have travelled with SriLankan Airlines to Australia. The new partnership will enhance SriLankan Airlines service to Australia as the airline prepares to cruise to new altitudes above the land down under, according to the SriLankan Airlines.",

Addressing a media briefing today (28), the Acting Finance Minister expressed confidence of reaching the staff-level agreement following the conclusion of discussions with relevant stakeholders. The IMF team which arrived in Sri Lanka on the September 13, left the island last evening (27), following the conclusion of the first review of the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) provided to Sri Lanka. We are close to securing a staff-level agreement with the IMF. There are a few pending matters to be discussed, which will take place when the President arrives. The IMF office in Sri Lanka has a few discussion points to hash out with the IMF headquarters. I guess that once these discussions conclude, we will be able to arrive at a staff-level agreement. Furthermore, Semasinghe pointed out that the matter pertaining to government revenue was highlighted at the IMF review, mentioning that it indicates an increase of 43 compared to government revenue in 2022. There are fears that the IMF agreement has been terminated, he said, adding that there is no truth in that, but the country has to arrive at some agreements after extensive discussions. Concurrently, relevant institutions are executing necessary measures pertaining to debt restructuring. However, Semasinghe asserted that with this being the status quo, there is no need to feel anxious or harbour negative thoughts regarding the matter.",

Umar polled 45 votes, more than twice as many as those of his competitors, Thilanga Dakshitha, who honed a total of 20 votes. The election was held at 03:00 p.m. today at the Sri Lanka Foundation Institutes Auditorium, under the scrutiny of both the Federation Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) and the Asian Football Confederation (AFC). In a circular to member associations, FIFA Secretary General Fatma Samoura stated that as a result of the decision taken by the Bureau of the FIFA Council on 21 January 2023, the FFSL had been suspended until further notice in accordance with article 16 of the FIFA Statutes, due to government interference. Thereby, the FFSL lost all of its membership rights, as defined in Article 13 of the FIFA Statutes, until further notice. On December 25 2022, FIFA had issued a red notice to Sri Lankan Football authorities, raising concerns over the Electoral roadmap of the Football Federation of Sri Lanka. However, the suspension imposed on the FFSL was lifted on 28 August, following which both FIF and the AFC continued to monitor the situation until the election was held. Against this backdrop, the FIFA and the AFC approved and included Sri Lanka in the official World Cup draw on the strict conditional basis that the FFSL election be conducted at least 10 days prior to the World Cup match. A three-member committee was appointed by Minister of Sports and Youth Affairs Roshan Ranasinghe on 25 July, to call for, and hold the FFSL elections.",

CEB General Manager Eng. Dr. Narendra De Silva said they have sought an electricity tariff hike in October, which was supposed to be made in January. Dr. De Silva said the CEB had to bear additional costs for power generation as it was unable to generate an adequate amount of hydropower this year. According to him, 4,500 gigawatt hours (GWh) of hydropower was expected to be produced, but only 3,750 GWh of hydropower had been produced. Thereby, an additional 750 GWh of electricity had to be produced from thermal power plants, adding that additional costs had to be borne by the CEB as a result. The PUCSL chairman Manjula Fernando said the CEBs request, which was forwarded to the commission on Wednesday (Sept. 28), would be taken into consideration.",

Police suspect that the police constable in question had made various calls using this newly found piece of evidence, after having gone to Kadawatha with the suspected owner of the phone. Harak Kata, who was being interrogated by eight CID officers on 10 September, had reportedly laced the officers tea with poison, with the help of the Police Constable in question, during his questioning. He had subsequently requested to go to the washroom, and was escorted out of the interrogation room with his aide  the constable, and another sub-inspector attached to the Police Special Task Force (STF), assigned for the suspects protection. Although his handcuffs were removed at that point, the underworld kingpin had then walked out of the washroom acting as if he was still cuffed and had then attempted to snatch the STF officers firearm leading to a scuffle. A group of other officers were quick to arrive at the scene of the incident upon hearing the commotion and detained Harak Kata in their custody. Amidst the altercation, the constable in question had reportedly fled the CID premises and remains in hiding to date.

        "date": "September 29, 2023 09:30 pm",
        "content": "Prosecutors in Nagoya, Japan said on Friday (29 Sep.) that they have decided not to charge officials at an immigration center in the city for the second time over the 2021 death of a Sri Lankan detainee, despite her familys repeated calls for them to be indicted. The decision by the Nagoya District Prosecutors Office effectively ends its probe into the case of Ratnayake Liyanage Wishma Sandamali, who died at age 33 in March 2021 while in detention at the Nagoya Regional Immigration Services Bureau after complaining of ill health for around a month. In June last year, prosecutors dropped charges against 13 immigration bureau officials over allegations of murder and abandonment resulting in death after a criminal complaint filed by the family. A citizens committee for the inquest of prosecution in Nagoya said the prosecutors should reconsider whether they can charge the officials, including the director at the time, for professional negligence resulting in her death. Prosecutors relaunched their investigation into the case but said Friday they could not specify causes of her death or developments leading to her death and therefore could not conclude whether the immigration officials were able to foresee the worsening of her condition. Shoichi Ibusuki, a lawyer representing the family, said in a statement that the prosecutors covered up and disregarded a crime committed by those in power. We will continue to fight to hold them accountable, he said. The Nagoya Regional Immigration Services Bureau said it is not in a position to comment on the prosecutors decision. Wishma arrived in Japan in 2017 as a student but was later taken into custody at the immigration facility for overstaying her visa. The family also filed a lawsuit against the central government in March last year, seeking damages over her death. In the ongoing suit, they allege Wishma was illegally detained and died due to lack of necessary medical care. Wishmas death sparked scrutiny of Japans treatment of foreign detainees and triggered calls demanding more information about her death. Source - The Japan Times - Agencies",

Pradeepas daughter had filed a complaint at the Mulleriyawa Police on Wednesday (27 Sep.), claiming that her mother had gone missing.

Investigations have revealed that the duo had had a dispute over a money-related issue, while blood stains, strands of hair and shreds of womens clothing were found at the suspects abandoned house in Siyamabalape.

        "date": "September 30, 2023 07:13 am",
        "content": "US police have charged a former gang leader with the 1996 murder of rapper Tupac Shakur, a breakthrough in a long-running case still gripping the public. The New York-born hip-hop legend was shot four times aged 25 in a drive-by attack in Las Vegas. On Friday, Nevadas grand jury indicted Duane Keffe D Davis, 60, on one count of murder with a deadly weapon. Police say he planned the deadly shooting after his nephew was involved in a fight with Shakur in a casino. Davis was arrested near his Las Vegas home early on Friday, and will appear in court within days. Las Vegas police (LVMPD) have shared his mugshot. Greg Kading, a retired Los Angeles police detective who spent years investigating Shakurs murder, told the Associated Press he is not surprised by Mr Davis arrest. All the other direct conspirators or participants are all dead, Mr Kading said, calling Mr Davis the last man standing in the case. In court, prosecutor Marc DiaGiacomo described Mr Davis - a former leader of the South Side Compton Crips street gang - as the on-ground, on-site commander who ordered the death of Shakur. At a news conference later on Friday, police officer Jason Johansson said the forces persistence in the investigation had ultimately paid off, before explaining what led to the breakthrough. He said Orlando Anderson, the suspects late nephew, and Shakur had been involved in a fight in a casino shortly before the rapper was shot on 7 September 1996. He died in hospital a few days later. Mr Johansson showed reporters hotel security camera footage of Anderson being beaten. He said this ultimately led to the retaliatory shooting of Shakur as he was waiting in his car at a red light. The officer added it became obvious very quickly that this was a gang-related crime, and the case had been reviewed multiple times. But it was not until 2018, when new information came to light, that the case was reinvigorated. Mr Johansson also mentioned Mr Daviss own admissions to media outlets that he was in the vehicle where the shots were fired from. At the same press conference, a visibly emotional Sheriff Kevin McMahill said that for 27 years the family of Tupac Shakur have been waiting for justice. There have been many people who did not believe that the murder of Tupac Shakur was important to this police department. Im here to tell you: that was simply not the case. Our goal at LVMPD has always been to hold those... responsible for Tupacs violent murder accountable, the sheriff added. Shakur, whose stage name was stylised as 2Pac, released his debut album in 1991. One of the most acclaimed names in hip-hop, his death inspired several documentaries. He sold more than 75 million records worldwide, enjoying chart success with hits including California Love, All Eyez On Me and Changes. He also found success acting in films like Juice, Poetic Justice, Above The Rim, Gridlockd and Gang Related. In June this year the rapper received a posthumous star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

        "date": "September 30, 2023 08:05 am",
        "content": "A state of emergency has been declared in New York City as strong storms bring flash flooding. Many of the citys subway systems, streets and highways have flooded, while at least one terminal at LaGuardia Airport closed on Friday. Up to 8in (20cm) of rain fell in some parts of the city, and another few inches are expected later on Friday, forecasters said. This is a dangerous, life-threatening storm, Governor Kathy Hochul has said. I am declaring a state of emergency across New York City, Long Island, and the Hudson Valley due to the extreme rainfall were seeing throughout the region, Gov Hochul said on X, formerly known as Twitter. She urged people to take steps to stay safe and never attempt to travel on flooded roads. No deaths or critical injuries have been reported. A state of emergency was also declared in the New Jersey town of Hoboken, just across the Hudson River from New York City. In New York City, Mayor Eric Adams, warned people it was a time for heightened alertness and extreme caution as the state of emergency was put in place. Some of our subways are flooded and it is extremely difficult to move around the city, he told a press briefing. On Friday evening, Mr Adams told CBS, the BBCs partner in the US, that there were 15 rescues from cars and three rescues from basement apartments. Flooding caused major disruptions to New Yorks subway system and the Metro North commuter rail service, according to the Metropolitan Transportation Agency. Some subway lines were suspended entirely, and many stations were closed. In Mamaroneck, a Westchester County suburb north of the city, emergency officials used inflatable rafts to rescue people trapped in buildings by floods, Reuters reported. Pictures and video footage showed people wading through water reaching up to their knees, as streets and subways were hit by heavy rain. Several videos posted to social media appeared to show water pouring from the ceiling and walls of subway stations and onto inundated platforms. More than 2.5in of rain was reported in one hour in Brooklyn Navy Yard. In a virtual briefing, New Yorks chief climate officer Rohit Aggarwala said that the citys sewage system was only designed to handle 1.75 inches an hour. Its no surprise that parts of Brooklyn have borne the brunt of this, he said. In South Williamsburg, Brooklyn, workers waded through knee-high water as they tried to unclog a drain as cardboard and other debris floated by. One resident, Kelly Hayes, told the BBC that she estimated that the flood damage to her bar and kitchen in the Gowanus neighbourhood will cost between 25,000 and 30,000 (20,500-24,500). Terminal A at La Guardia Airport was closed because of flooding, authorities said. Passengers were advised to check with their airline before travelling. The New York Police Department also announced multiple road closures and said the National Guard had been deployed. Elsewhere, traffic hit a standstill as water rose above cars tires along a stretch of the FDR Drive - a major road along the east side of Manhattan. New York City has had nearly 14in of rain so far this month, making it the wettest September since 1882, according to National Weather Service data. Source: BBC -Agencies",

        "date": "September 30, 2023 12:09 pm",
        "content": "A panel constituted by the Tamil Nadu government to find durable solutions to short- and long-term issues of the Sri Lankan Tamils living in and out of camps across the State submitted its interim report to Chief Minister M.K. Stalin at the Secretariat on Friday. The interim report has explored ways of granting Indian citizenship to Sri Lankan nationals living in the State and made certain recommendations in this regard. We have submitted an interim report to the Chief Minister, outlining key recommendations on durable solutions to the issues of Sri Lankan Tamils living in Tamil Nadu and legal pathways towards citizenship. We have made the recommendations after studying the data collected from the camps over the past two years and assessing the evolution of jurisprudence in this regard, Manuraj Shunmugasundaram, Legal Expert-Advisory Committee, told The Hindu. According to a source that accessed the report, the panel has made recommendations that included pathways to citizenship, steps towards their integration into Indian society in Tamil Nadu and a repatriation package. The report makes a strong case for about 5,000-odd Tamils of Indian origin (who were taken to Sri Lanka by the colonial British to work in tea plantations) and explores options of citizenship for those often identified as Sri Lankan Tamils. The Indian-origin Tamils have a strong case as they left India only a hundred years ago and the three pacts signed between India and Sri Lanka  including the Sirimavo Bandaranaike-Lal Bahadur Shastri Pact and the Sirimavo Bandaranaike-Indira Gandhi Pact  favour Indian citizenship for them. As for Sri Lankan Tamils, they have been grouped into about six categories, depending on how they entered India, and explored options for each of the categories, the source said. For instance, a woman, born in 1987 to Sri Lankan parents who arrived in India and lived in a camp, obtained an Indian passport after moving the court, citing Section 3 of the Citizenship Act, 1955. There are several others who could benefit from this case. There are other categories who obtained birth certificates from Indian authorities or who married Indian citizens, the source said. Minister for Non-Resident Tamils Welfare Gingee K.S. Masthan submitted the report to the Chief Minister. Besides migration and refugee experts, representatives of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the Organisation for Eelam Refugees Rehabilitation (OfERR), Adventist Development and Relief Agency (ADRA) and Jesuit Refugee Service (JRS) were present.

        "title": "Sri Lanka to unveil new SOP for visits by foreign ships, aircraft - report",
        "date": "September 30, 2023 01:47 pm",
        "content": "The Sri Lankan government is set to unveil a new standard operating procedure (SOP) for visits by foreign ships or aircraft, including military assets, as part of efforts to address Indias concerns over port calls by Chinese vessels, people familiar with the matter said. The SOP, which will include guidelines and details about the type of vessels to be allowed into Sri Lankas ports and territorial waters, are expected to be formally announced by authorities in Colombo soon, people familiar with the initiative in both Sri Lanka and India said on condition of anonymity. The development comes against the backdrop of a diplomatic row between New Delhi and Colombo last year over the docking of Yuan Wang 5, a vessel used by the Peoples Liberation Army (PLA) to track satellites and ballistic missiles, at the Chinese-controlled Hambantota port. Another PLA Navy vessel, Hai Yang 24 Hao, known to have surveillance capabilities, visited Colombo port in August 2023. The SOP will lay down the type of vessels that can make port calls. For instance, the class of submarines and warships that can make visits to Sri Lankas ports. The SOP will also state how long the vessels can remain in the countrys territorial waters and the type of activities they can engage in, one of the people cited above said. A second person familiar with the initiative on the Indian side said: The guidelines and SOP are fine but what will matter are actions taken on the ground. The Indian sides greatest concern that the Chinese vessels can use their equipment to snoop on Indian security facilities while in Sri Lankan waters, the people said. Sri Lankan President Ranil Wickremesinghe referred to the SOP while participating in the annual Indo-Pacific Islands Dialogue organised by Carnegie Endowment in New York this month. He contended the new SOP built on earlier procedures set by the Sri Lankan Navy and were framed following consultations with the Indian side. Recently, we had discussions with India and weve now taken on all the amendments. So, any ships that come in now are according to an operation procedure which we have done together with India. I cant see any ship thats a threat coming in through that operating procedure, Wickremesinghe said. He said only Chinese research vessels visit the island country under the terms of agreements between the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the National Aquatic Resources Research and Development Agency (NARA) and some universities of Sri Lanka. Such vessels have visited Sri Lanka for the past 10 years, he added. Both India and the US have expressed concern about a planned visit to Sri Lanka by another Chinese research vessel, Shi Yan 6, described by Chinas state media as a ship with a 60-member crew that conducts oceanography, marine geology, and marine ecology tests. China sought permission from Sri Lanka in August for a port call by the vessel, but the people said a final decision on dates for a visit is yet to be made. While the Indian side conveyed its concerns to authorities in Colombo, US undersecretary of state for political affairs Victoria Nuland took up the matter with Sri Lankan foreign minister Ali Sabry during a meeting on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in New York. Shi Yan 6 is expected to arrive in Sri Lanka in October to carry out tests with NARA. Source - Hindustan Times --Agencies",

        "content": "The married couple, who had been arrested to assist a probe into the discovery of the bodies of three Sri Lankans in a house in Jalan Perhentian Kampung Kovil Hilir, Sentul in Malaysia recently, had their remand extended on Friday. City police chief, Datuk Allaudeen Abdul Majid, said police had applied for a remand extension against the Sri Lankan couple, who are in their 40s. They had earlier been remanded for a week. Their remand has been extended to October 6. To date, there are no new developments in the case and we are still investigating, he told Harian Metro. On Sept 22, sounds of screams, believed to be from a fight, led to the discovery of three bodies, belonging to Sri Lankan men, at the house. Their hands and feet were bound, with their heads covered in plastic. The bodies, found in the store room, were stacked on top of each other. One of the bodies was completely nude. Allaudeen was previously quoted as saying that police had received a phone call from members of the public, informing them of a commotion coming from a four-storey shop house, around 11pm. He said following the discovery of the bodies, police arrested the Sri Lankan couple, who had rented the house. One of the three bodies was believed to be that of their son. Police subsequently launched a hunt for two more suspects and tracked them down to a forest in Hulu Langat, Selangor. The case is being probed under Section 302 of the Penal Code for murder. --Agencies",

Issuing a statement, the BASL has expressed its deep concern regarding the recent resignation of the Mullaitivu District Judge whose decision to step down was purportedly prompted by threats.

In light of this, the BASL calls on the government to initiate a thorough impartial investigation into the matter, highlighting that it is crucial to ascertain the veracity of these threats. The BASL has further stated that such actions, if found to be true, not only undermine the independence of the judiciary but also erode public trust in the justice system. The resignation of Judge T.

        "date": "September 30, 2023 07:07 pm",
        "content": "More than 100,000 people have fled the Nagorno-Karabakh region, Armenia says. It means that that almost the entire population of the ethnic Armenian enclave has left since Azerbaijan seized the region last week. Azerbaijan has said it wants to reintegrate the area and treat its residents as equals, but an Armenian spokesman said this was just a lie. Nagorno-Karabakh - recognised as part of Azerbaijan - had been run by ethnic Armenians for three decades. The mountainous region in the South Caucasus has been supported by Armenia - but also by its ally, Russia. At least 200 ethnic Armenians and dozens of Azerbaijani soldiers were killed as Azerbaijans army swept in. As part of a ceasefire deal, separatists have agreed to surrender their weapons. The leader of the self-declared Republic of Nagorno-Karabakh has said it will cease to exist in the new year. Nazeli Baghdasaryan, a spokeswoman for Armenias prime minister, said the number of refugees entering the country over the past week had reached 100,417, out of Nagorno-Karabakhs estimated population of 120,000. The UN refugee agency (UNHCR) also stated that 100,000 people had fled, stating that many of those fleeing are hungry, exhausted and need immediate assistance. Artak Beglaryan, an Armenian former separatist official, said that the last groups of Nagorno-Karabakh residents were on their way to Armenia Saturday. At most a few hundred persons remain, most of whom are officials, emergency services employees, volunteers, some persons with special needs, he wrote on social media. In addition to those killed during the Azerbaijani military operation, at least 170 people were killed in a huge explosion at a fuel depot in Nagorno-Karabakh on Monday. It is not yet clear what caused the explosion near the main city of Khankendi, known as Stepanakert by Armenians. The UN says it is sending a mission to Nagorno-Karabakh this weekend to assess the humanitarian situation, after Azerbaijan said it would allow such a visit to take place. Armenias ambassador-at-large, Edmon Marukyan, criticised the timing of the visit but stressed that it was important that UN officials saw for themselves what ethnic Armenians had been subjected to. Its good they will be there and they will become witnesses that these people were ethnically cleansed from their ancestral homeland, from their homes where their parents, where their ancestors were living and these people were totally cleansed from this territory, he told the BBC. But he dismissed Azerbaijans assurances as a lie. Its total propaganda, another Azerbaijani fake propaganda. Nobodys going to stay in Nagorno- Karabakh, he said. Source - BBC --Agencies",

        "content": "A police constable has been arrested on suspicion of aiding and abetting notorious underworld figure Harak Katas recent escape bid at the Criminal Investigation Department (CID). The officer, who was taken into custody by the CID, will be handed over to the Terrorist Investigation Division (TID) for further probes. However, the other police constable, who was identified as Harak Katas aide, is still at large. On September 10, Harak Kata, who was being interrogated by eight CID officers, had reportedly laced the officers tea with poison, with the help of the Police Constable in question, during his questioning. He had subsequently requested to go to the washroom, and was escorted out of the interrogation room with his aide  a police constable, and another sub-inspector attached to the Police Special Task Force (STF), assigned for the suspects protection. Although his handcuffs were removed at that point, the underworld kingpin had then walked out of the washroom acting as if he was still cuffed and had then attempted to snatch the STF officers firearm leading to a scuffle. A group of other officers were quick to arrive at the scene, upon hearing the commotion and detained Harak Kata in their custody. Amidst the altercation, the constable in question had reportedly fled the CID premises and remains in hiding to date. On 18 September, the mother and brother-in-law of this constable were arrested. The police also obtained a 90-day detention to interrogate them.",

        "title": "Online Safety Bill, an assault on freedom of expression, opinion  information - ICJ",
        "date": "September 30, 2023 09:00 pm",
        "content": "The International Commission of Jurists (ICJ) has raised concerns about Sri Lankas new Online Safety Bill, which was published in the government gazette on Sept. 18, emphasizing that if adopted in its present form, the legislation would serve to crush free expression and further contract an already shrinking civic space in the country. In a statement released on Friday (Sept. 29), the ICJ said the Bill, albeit intending to dramatically regulate the content of online communication including by the general public, stands to undermine the exercise of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the country, including freedom of information and expression. The Geneva-based rights organization notes that the provisions related to the setting up, appointment and functions of an Online Safety Commission and other experts, the vague and overboard wording of conduct designated as punishable offences and unnecessary and disproportionate punitive sanctions are of particular concern. The ICJ raised concerns about the Online Safety Commission being on the sole discretion of the President, adding that it contrasts with other notionally independent commissions in Sri Lanka, the appointments to which require the consent of the Constitutional Council by way of nomination or ratification. This bill would give the president unfettered discretion where both appointment and removal is concerned. ICJs Legal and Policy Director, Ian Seiderman says this Bill is deeply flawed in its design and would be open to abuse by the Sri Lankan government, which it says has persistently failed to uphold freedom of expression. He, however, acknowledged that the spread of online hate-speech and disinformation needs to be tackled. Seiderman stresses that the Bill risks being used to suppress important public debate regarding the conduct of the government and matters of public policy. He says the current draft must be either withdrawn or amended to be brought in line with Sri Lankas international human rights obligations guaranteeing freedom of expression, opinion, and information. The CEJ is of the opinion that the Bill should not be evaluated in a vacuum but instead must be read in conjunction with existing and proposed legislation that threaten human rights. Such laws include the extremely misused ICCPR Act of 2005, the Prevention of Terorrism Act (PTA), the Bureau of Rehabilitation Act, and the proposed Anti-Terrorism law which seeks to replace the PTA. Following are some of the problematic aspects of the new Online Safety Bill pointed out by the ICJ: - Wide ranging and overly broad powers of the Online Safety Commission and appointed Experts The bill provides for the establishment of a five-member Online Safety Commission that is to be appointed on the sole discretion of the President (clause 5). This is in contrast to other notionally independent commissions in Sri Lanka, the appointments to which require the consent of the Constitutional Council by way of nomination or ratification. This bill would give the president unfettered discretion where both appointment and removal is concerned. The Commission would also be vested with a wide range of powers, some of which encroach into the functions of the judiciary. It essentially acts as sole arbiter of matter of fact and is entitled to issue notices or directives against any person, internet service provider (ISP) or internet intermediaries whowhich is alleged to have communicated a prohibited or false statement. The bill does not specify the process through which the Commission would arrive at this decision. Moreover, the Commission is granted authority to block websites and instruct ISPs to restrict access to specific online locations. This may result in undue government overreach and censorship and impermissible limitations on the exercise of the right to information protected by Article 14A of the Constitution and international law. Further clause 37 allows for the Minister to appoint Experts to assist police officers in investigations. The experts are private individuals who can accompany police officers during search procedures, but are also given the power upon authority granted by a police officer above the rank of a sub-inspector to require a person to hand over any documents or device, provide traffic data or be orally examined (clause 37 (6)). Such excessive powers in the hands of unaccountable private individuals provide avenues for abuse. The bill does not provide for judicial review of the Commissions decisions or procedures. Instead clause 49 seeks to protect the Commission, its staff, or any expert appointed under clause 37 from being brought to court for any act or omission done in good faith. - Vague and overbroad offences A particularly problematic aspect of the bill are provisions of vague and overbroad definitions of offences. Article 19(3) of the ICCPR provides that the right to freedom of expression and opinion may be subject to certain restrictions, but that these restrictions must be provided by law and necessary for one of a limited numbers of legitimate purposes, namely to protect the rights and reputations of others, national security, public order or public health or morals. The measure of limitation must be proportionate, using the least restrictive means possible to achieve the purpose. The requirement that any restrictive measure be provided by law means that they must comply with the principle of legality, by which the law must be stated with precision as to allow persons to be able to conform their conduct in compliance. Similarly, Article 15 (2) of the Sri Lankan Constitution provides for possibility of restriction of the right as may be prescribed by law in the interests of racial and religious harmony or in relation to parliamentary privilege, contempt of court, defamation or incitement to an offence. The prohibitions listed in this draft legislation go beyond the restrictions allowed for under the ICCPR and the Sri Lankan Constitution, as clause 12 states that any person who poses a threat to national security, public health or public order or promotes feelings of ill-will and hostility between different classes of people, by communicating a false statement, commits an offence. In addition, several acts that would constitute offence are only vaguely defined, if at all. This includes communicating a false statement with the deliberate intention of wounding the religious feelings of any other person (clause 16) or outraging the religious feelings of any class of persons, insults or attempts to insult the religion or the religious beliefs of that class (clause 17). These clauses are overbroad in that they would encompass expression that is protected under human rights law. Clause 14 makes it an offence to wantonly giving provocation by false statement to cause riot. This language is open to abuse by the authorities, as evidenced by practices arising from other legislation, including the ICCPR Act and the PTA. Repeated mention of religion in these provisions is a cause for concern as they come in a context where there is ongoing strife relating to contested religious sites between majority and minority religious communities, thus creating risk of selected application to silence expression by persons from minority religious communities. - Disproportionate Punishment The draft bill prescribes unjustifiably hefty punishments of fines and a period of imprisonment ranging from one, two, three or five years for overbroad and ill-defined offences. It also states that in the event of a second or subsequent conviction, such term of imprisonment or fine or both such imprisonment and fine may be doubled. Clause 25 of the bill, which refers to failure to comply with the directives of the Commission would make it an offence to fails to comply with such directive within a period of 24 hours and makes the person liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years or to a fine not exceeding one million rupees.",

The National Population and Talent Division said the largest increase came from workers in the construction, marine shipyard and process sectors as contractors hired more workers for projects that were delayed by the pandemic. The labour market has remained tight since the country dropped pandemic restrictions last April, with total employment at 3.8 above its pre-pandemic level in Q1 this year. The economy grew 3.6 in 2022. The government, however, expects growth to be sluggish this year. The ministry in August narrowed its gross domestic product (GDP) growth forecast to 0.5 to 1.5 this year from 0.5 to 2.5 previously. In 2020, Singapores population shrank by 2. It was the first time the population had fallen since the 1970s as 47,000 foreigners left amid strict Covid-19 lockdowns and travel restrictions. The population shrank further in 2021 as 147,000 foreign workers left Singapore, causing the population to drop to 5.45 million. Source: Reuters -Agencies",
