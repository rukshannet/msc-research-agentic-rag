Explaining the objective of the National Youth Platform, the Presidents Media Division (PMD) stated that this initiative is expected to provide the Sri Lankan youths the opportunity to be a part of the nation-building process which aims to make the country a prosperous and well-developed nation by the year 2048. The whole program is oriented to kick-start a 25-year development agenda and make youth responsible partners in the process, the PMD explained. Elaborating on the rationale for setting up the National Youth Platform, the PMD noted that by the year 2048, the current youth of the nation will be adults and will be playing key roles in the government and private sectors of the country. Hence, it is in the hands of the youths to work from now onwards to make the country a better place instead of complaining about the system and the conduct of the politicians in the future. The President has a firm belief that if the youth want to make a change they have to come forward and take leadership and the National Youth Platform is the opportunity for them to emerge, the PMD said further.

        "title": "From electric skates to an AI-powered bird feeder, CES 2023 will showcase latest tech",
        "date": "January 5, 2023 01:27 pm",
        "content": "Tech companies of all sizes are showing off their latest products at CES, formerly known as the Consumer Electronics Show. The show is getting back to normal after going completely virtual in 2021 and seeing a significant drop in 2022 attendance because of the pandemic. Exhibitors range from big names including Sony and LG to tiny startups. You might see the next big thing or something that will never make it past the prototype stage. On Tuesday night, the show kicked off with media previews from just some of the 3,000 companies signed up to attend. CES officially opens Thursday. Pokemon, but make it birds Bird Buddy showed off a smart bird feeder that takes snapshots of feathered friends as they fly in to eat some treats. The startup says its AI technology can recognize more than 1,000 species of birds, allowing users to share through a mobile app what kind of birds theyre feeding. We try to kind of gamify the collection so its a really fun game that you can play  almost like a real life Pok√©mon Go with real animals and wildlife in your backyard, said Kyle Buzzard, the companys co-founder and chief hardware officer. The product has already sparked some interest from consumers who want to show the world what birds are coming into their backyards. The company, which began as a Kickstarter project in 2020, says it started shipping its bird feeders in September and has already sold all 100,000 in its inventory. The price for the basic feeder is 199. Electric skates Journalists had fun zipping around the exhibit hall on remote-controlled, electric inline skates from French startup AtmosGear. The battery lasts for 20 miles (32 kilometers), said founder Mohamed Soliman, who hopes people will see them as a viable way to commute, like electric bikes or scooters. My goal is for everyone to go skating again because its so much fun, every time you see people skating you see them with a big smile, Soliman said. A waist bag holds the battery and cables connected to the skates. They also can be used as regular skates when they need to be charged or skaters simply want to travel under their own power. The 500 skates are available for pre-order. The company has taken orders for 150 pairs so far and is aiming for 200 orders to start production. Digital temporary tattoos A handheld device displayed by South Korean company Prinker allows you to quickly and easily apply temporary tattoos. The device uses cosmetic-grade ink with a library of thousands of designs or the option to make your own with the companys app. After picking a tattoo, you just wave the device over wherever you want it applied. The tattoos are waterproof but wash off with soap. The flagship model is 279 and a smaller model is 229. Ink cartridges good for 1,000 tattoos are 119. Helping find your way Japan-based Loovic has created a device designed to solve the challenges of those who have difficulty navigating while they walk. The device worn around the neck employs sounds and vibrations to guide users to destinations, enabling them to look at whats around rather than focusing on a phones map app. Loovic co-founder and CEO Toru Yamanaka said he was inspired to create the device for his son, who has a cognitive impairment making it difficult for him to navigate. The prototype device is not yet available to the public. A fitness tracker for your dog If you wonder what your dog is doing while youre not home, French startup Invoxia has a product for you. The companys smart dog collar monitors your pets activity and sleep, sending the data to your phone. The latest version unveiled at CES, which has a GPS tracker, includes more advanced heart health monitoring. The collar is 149 in the U.S. while a monthly 8.25 subscription to the app monitors the data and shares it with your veterinarian. Metaverse for kids The creators of Roybi, an educational AI robot that helps children learn about STEM topics and new languages, are venturing into the metaverse. The RoybiVerse is expected to offer stations where K-12 and higher education students can learn about a wide range of educational topics. Users walking around the RoybiVerse will be able to visit an area where theyll learn about dinosaurs or walk over to the virtual library where they can pick a book and read it. The RoybiVerse, which is expected to launch by mid-2023, will be available in virtual reality headsets and on a website. No robot needed. Source - The Associated Press -Agencies",

        "date": "January 5, 2023 01:42 pm",
        "content": "Israel released one of its longest-serving Palestinian prisoners on Thursday, after 40 years in jail. Karim Younis, 66, was freed and left in the city of Raanana, about 20km north of Tel Aviv, by Israeli authorities, the Palestinian Wafa news agency reported. His family had not been notified of his release, it said. Younis was convicted by Israel in 1983 of the murder of Israeli soldier Cpl Avraham Bromberg three years earlier in the occupied Golan Heights and sentenced to life in prison. That was later reduced to 40 years. We are ready to offer another 40 years for the freedom of our people, he said after being released. Younis was set to be released in 2013 as part of a deal negotiated by then-US Secretary of State John Kerry. The agreement would have freed several batches of prisoners held in Israeli jails since before the Oslo Accords of 1993 and 1995. Israel refused to release him, saying that as Younis had Israeli citizenship, it was an internal issue. He was the longest-serving Palestinian citizen of Israel in prison. Nael Barghouti, from the occupied West Bank and who does not have Israeli citizenship, is still in prison after 42 years. Karim Youniss cousin Maher Younis, who was also convicted of Brombergs murder, is also expected to be released. Israeli forces raided his family home in the northern town of Arara on Wednesday, Wafa reported. Troops confiscated Palestinian flags and banners promoting the Fatah party, which is dominant in the occupied West Bank. After his release, Karim Younis visited his aunt, Mahers mother, before going to the graves of his parents, who died while he was in prison, the agency reported. It comes days after Israel swore in the most right-wing government in its history. Several ministers have pledged tougher action on Palestinian prisoners, including those who hold Israeli citizenship. Interior Minister Aryeh Deri on Tuesday called for Karim Younis to be stripped of his Israeli citizenship, in a letter to the countrys Attorney General, saying such a move has legal validity in circumstances when people use their Israeli citizenship to harm Israel and its citizens. National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir demanded the death penalty for Palestinians found guilty of attacking Israelis as a condition for joining the coalition government. He has ordered authorities to suppress celebrations outside the prison were Younis was held, as well as in his hometown. Source - The National - With input from agencies",

        "date": "January 5, 2023 01:59 pm",
        "content": "A special Gazette notification has been issued restricting bringing in more than 22 carats in gold as jewellery to Sri Lanka in a bid to prevent gold smuggling, says the Finance Ministry. In a statement, the Ministry of Finance, Economic Stabilization and National Policies has pointed out that several cases of gold smuggling into the country were reported during the recent period under the guise of wearing the gold jewellery upon entering the country. It has been revealed that some smugglers are engaged in gold smuggling activities on a daily basis due to the lack of restrictions on carrying gold into the country, the Ministry mentioned. State Minister of Finance, Ranjith Siyambalapitiya has directly intervened in this regard and looked into the matter together with the Department of Customs, it said, further adding that it was discovered that around 50 kg of gold are smuggled into the island daily. Further, the Ministry has also emphasized that the country loses about USD 30 million monthly as a result of such smuggling activities. However, after taking strict measures in order to prevent these types of trafficking activities, threatening calls were received to the responsible parties and the matter was disclosed with evidence through a press release on 17-10-2022, it added. The statement further includes that the second largest haul of illegally smuggled gold in history was found by Sri Lanka Customs on December 09, 2022, highlighting that 22 kilograms of gold with an estimated value of over Rs. 400 million were found in the operation. Accordingly, following President Wickremesinghe issuing the relevant Gazette notification restricting bringing in more than 22 carats as gold jewellery into Sri Lanka, a special permit will now be required to bring in gold jewellery of more than 22 carats into the island.",

        "title": "Pope Francis leads funeral of his predecessor Benedict XVI in prestigious ceremony at Vatican",
        "date": "January 5, 2023 02:59 pm",
        "content": "Members of the faithful paid homage to former Pope Benedict XVI Thursday, with a funeral at St. Peters Square in Vatican City marked by pomp and tradition. In line with Benedicts wishes, his funeral will be simple, according to the director of the press office of the Holy See, Matteo Bruni. It will be the first occasion in modern times a pope has presided over his predecessors funeral. Dignitaries and religious leaders lined the square, which can seat approximately 60,000 people, to take part in the prestigious ceremony. Prime Minister Petr Fiala of the Czech Republic, was among those in attendance, according to CNN affiliate CNN Prima. The ceremony will be similar to that of a reigning pope but there will be some modifications, Bruni said. Benedict will be named pope emeritus during the funeral, and the language of some prayers will be different because he was not the reigning pope when he died. The faithful prayed to the rosary as Benedicts coffin left St. Peters Basilica at around 8:45 a.m. local time (2.45 a.m. ET) Thursday. Gods faithful people, gathered here, now accompanies and entrusts to him the life of the one who was their pastor, Francis said as he delivered the homily. Like the women at the tomb, we too have come with the fragrance of gratitude and the balm of hope, in order to show him once more the love that is undying. We want to do this with the same wisdom, tenderness and devotion that he bestowed upon us over the years. Together, we want to say: Father, into your hands we commend his spirit. Benedict, faithful friend of the Bridegroom, may your joy be complete as you hear his voice, now and forever, Francis added. Francis started leading the mass Thursday morning, when he is expected to give a homily at 10 a.m. local time (4 a.m. ET). Benedicts coffin will then be transported through the Basilica and to the Vatican crypt for the burial, in the first tomb of John Paul II. The tomb was vacated after John Paul IIs body and remains were moved to a chapel inside the Basilica after he became a saint. At the time of the burial during the rite, a webbing will be placed around the coffin with the seals of the apostolic chamber, the pontifical house and liturgical celebrations. The cypress coffin will be placed inside a zinc coffin that is soldered and sealed, and subsequently placed inside a wooden coffin, which will be buried. The ceremony is expected to end at around 11:15 a.m. local time (5.15 a.m. ET). High-profile dignitaries including Queen Sofia of Spain and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz are set to attend the funeral, alongside US Ambassador to the Holy See Joe Donelly. Benedict was the first pontiff in almost 600 years to resign his position, rather than hold office for life, passed away at the age of 95 on December 31 at a monastery in Vatican City, according to a statement from the Vatican. He was elected pope in April 2005, following John Paul IIs death. Benedict was known to be more conservative than his successor, Pope Francis, who has made moves to soften the Vaticans position on abortion and homosexuality, as well as doing more to deal with the sexual abuse crisis that has engulfed the church in recent years and clouded Benedicts legacy. The scroll that was put inside Pope Benedict XVIs coffin, which is a biography of his life and mentions some of the most important moments of his tenure, recalls that he firmly fought against pedophilia. He firmly fought against crimes committed by members of the clergy against minors or vulnerable persons, continually calling the Church to conversion, prayer, penance and purification, the scroll said. His death prompted tributes from political and religious leaders including US President Joe Biden, British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and the Dalai Lama. About 200,000 mourners, including Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni and President Sergio Mattarella, paid their respects to the former pontiff earlier this week during his lying-in-state in St. Peters Basilica. The public viewing of Benedict finished Wednesday, before an intimate religious rite during which items including coins and medals minted over his tenure and a scroll about the pontificate were placed into his sealed cypress coffin ahead of the funeral. Francis paid tribute to his predecessor during an audience at the Vatican Wednesday. I would like us to join with those here beside us who are paying their respects to Benedict XVI, and to turn my thoughts to him, a great master of catechesis, he said. May he help us rediscover in Christ the joy of believing and the hope of living. Source - CNN - With input from agencies",

        "title": "Romeo and Juliet: Olivia Hussey and Leonard Whiting sue over 1968 films sexual abuse",
        "date": "January 5, 2023 06:20 pm",
        "content": "The stars of the Oscar-winning 1968 film Romeo and Juliet are suing Paramount Pictures for sexual abuse over a nude scene they appeared in. Leonard Whiting and Olivia Hussey were teenagers when they made the movie. In a new legal case, the English actors, now in their 70s, claim director Franco Zeffirelli encouraged them to do nude scenes despite previous assurances that they would not have to. Paramount has not yet publicly responded to the claim. The two actors are seeking damages of more than 500m (417m), based on suffering they say they have experienced and the revenue brought in by the film since its release. They claim Zeffirelli, who died in 2019, initially told them they would wear flesh-coloured underwear in the bedroom scene. But on the morning of the shoot, they allege the director told them they would wear only body make-up, while assuring them the camera would be positioned to not show nudity. In the final film, Whitings bare buttocks and Husseys bare breasts were briefly shown during the scene. Zeffirelli told them they must act in the nude or the picture would fail and their careers would be hurt, the pair claim in the lawsuit. The actors believed they had no choice but to act in the nude in body makeup as demanded. Whiting was then aged 16 and is now 72, while Hussey was 15 when the film was shot and is now 71. The pair are suing Paramount for sexual abuse, sexual harassment and fraud. The lawsuit accuses the Hollywood studio of sexually exploiting the two young actors and distributing nude images of adolescent children. The court filing says Whiting and Hussey have suffered emotional damage and mental anguish for decades as a result of the way they were treated. The film was a huge success at the time, and has been shown to generations of students studying the Shakespeare play since. It was nominated for four Oscars, including best director and best picture, and won two - for cinematography and costume design. The lawsuit was filed on Friday in Santa Monica Superior Court under a California law that has temporarily suspended the statute of limitations - which means action cannot normally be taken once a certain time has elapsed - for child sex abuse. The suspension has led to a host of new lawsuits and the revival of many others that were previously dismissed. Tony Marinozzi, a business manager for the two actors, told BBC News they had been betrayed by the director and the studio. The pair were unable to take action sooner because they feared there would be ramifications for their careers and that they would not be believed, he said. There just wasnt any way for them to tell that story at that time, to get people to listen, he said. Now weve seen some movements with MeToo and other platforms, but at that time there just wasnt a way to tell that story, and its something that they have had to live with and probably struggle with for a lifetime. Solomon Gresen, a lawyer for the pair, added in a statement: Nude images of minors are unlawful and shouldnt be exhibited. These were very young, naive children in the 60s who had no understanding of what was about to hit them. All of a sudden they were famous at a level they never expected, and in addition they were violated in a way they didnt know how to deal with. In a 2018 interview with Variety, Hussey defended the nude scene. Nobody my age had done that before, she said, adding that Zeffirelli shot it tastefully. It was needed for the film. In a separate interview with Fox News, also conducted in 2018, she said the scene was taboo in the US, but that nudity was common in European films at the time. It wasnt that big of a deal, she said. And Leonard wasnt shy at all! In the middle of shooting, I just completely forgot I didnt have clothes on. Source - BBC -Agencies",

        "date": "January 5, 2023 09:08 pm",
        "content": "Prince Harry has claimed that his brother Prince William physically attacked him, according to the Guardian, which says it has seen a copy of the dukes upcoming memoir, Spare. The newspaper reported that the book sets out an argument between the pair over Prince Harrys wife Meghan. He grabbed me by the collar, ripping my necklace, and he knocked me to the floor, the Guardian quotes Harry. Kensington Palace said it has no comment to make. BBC News has not yet seen a copy of Spare. Buckingham Palace, which represents the household of the King, has yet to respond to a request for comment. The memoir will not be published until next Tuesday, but the Guardian said it obtained a copy amid what it called stringent pre-launch security. According to the Guardian, the book says the row was sparked by comments Prince William made to Prince Harry at his London home in 2019. Prince Harry, the paper says, writes that his brother was critical of his marriage to Meghan Markle - and that Prince William described her as difficult, rude and abrasive. The Duke of Sussex reportedly writes that his brother was parroting the press narrative as the confrontation escalated. Prince Harry is said to describe what happened next, including an alleged physical altercation. He set down a glass of water, called me another name, then came at me. It all happened so fast. So very fast. He grabbed me by the collar, ripping my necklace, and he knocked me to the floor. I landed on the dogs bowl, which cracked under my back, the pieces cutting into me. I lay there for a moment, dazed, then got to my feet and told him to get out. Martin Pengelly, a journalist for the Guardians US website who wrote its story, said he did not approach Prince Williams communication team. The reporter said that his article is a report on Harrys book, which hes written, its Harrys account. Mr Pengelly told BBC Radio 5 Live: We carefully, obviously in reporting it, didnt call it a fight because Harry says he didnt fight back. Prince Harry writes that his brother urged him to hit back and he refused to do so, according to the Guardian, but Prince William later looked regretful, and apologised. Photographs suggest Prince Harry regularly wore a dark necklace at events such as the Invictus Games, and on foreign tours with Meghan, as recently as September 2019. While publishers at Penguin Random House are yet to confirm whether the leaked excerpts from the book are genuine, Prince Harry has recently spoken of his troubled relationship with his brother. In the couples Harry and Meghan Netflix documentary, Prince Harry describes a meeting he attended with his brother, and father, the now King. Prince Harry described the conference in early 2020, which was also attended by the late Queen, as terrifying. It was terrifying to have my brother scream and shout at me and my father say things that just simply werent true, and my grandmother quietly sit there and sort of take it all in, he said. The Guardian says Prince Harry details a meeting with Charles, then Prince of Wales, and Prince William after the funeral of his grandfather, Prince Phillip, in April 2021. According to the paper, Prince Harry writes his father stood between him and Prince William, and said please, boys, dont make my final years a misery. In a trailer for a sit-down interview, which will be broadcast on 8 January ahead of the book release, the prince said: I would like to get my father back, I would like to have my brother back. However, Prince Harry told ITVs Tom Bradby theyve shown absolutely no willingness to reconcile, although it was not clear who he was referring to. Buckingham Palace declined to comment on this. Spare, ghostwritten by memoirist JR Moehringer and part of a multi-million dollar book deal, was previously believed to be subject to the upmost secrecy with few details known about its content. For Harry, this is his story at last, Penguin Random House said in a publicity statement back in October. With its raw, unflinching honesty, Spare is a landmark publication full of insight, revelation, self-examination, and hard-won wisdom about the eternal power of love over grief.

        "content": "U.S. President Joe Biden suggested Vladimir Putins struggle in Ukraine after 10 months of war and thousands of lives lost had prompted the Russian president to offer a 36-hour truce, saying, I think hes trying to find some oxygen. The Kremlin said Putin had ordered a ceasefire from midday on Friday after a call for a Christmas truce by Patriarch Kirill of Moscow, head of the Russian Orthodox Church. Ukraine spurned the ceasefire offer over Russias Orthodox Christmas, saying there would be no truce until Moscow withdraws its invading forces from occupied land. Asked about the proposed truce, Biden told reporters at the White House: Im reluctant to respond to anything that Putin says. I found it interesting that he was willing to bomb hospitals and nurseries and churches ... on the 25th and New Years. I mean, I think hes trying to find some oxygen. Russias ambassador in Washington, Anatoly Antonov, accused the U.S. administration of lacking any desire for a political settlement, adding that even the unilaterally declared ceasefire was being labelled an attempt to find some oxygen. All this means that Washington is set on fighting with us to the last Ukrainian, and the fate of Ukraines people does not worry the Americans at all, Antonov said in remarks on the embassys Facebook page that were framed as responses to media questions. Putins ceasefire would begin in time for observation of Christmas by Russias Orthodox Church on Jan. 7. Ukraines main Orthodox Church has been recognized as independent by the church hierarchy since 2019 and rejects any notion of allegiance to the Moscow patriarch. Many Ukrainian believers have shifted their calendar to celebrate Christmas on Dec. 25 as in the West. It would be the first major truce of the more than 10-month-old war that has claimed tens of thousands of lives and devastated large swaths of Ukraine. Source - Reuters - With input from agencies",

Accordingly, following an investigation into a complaint lodged regarding the incident, the Police Special Task Force (STF) found the child in question at the Randiya Uyana housing complex in Grandpass, Colombo. The child was then handed over to the Grandpass Police Station for further investigations, following which a female suspect was also arrested. Preliminary investigations have revealed that the woman, a resident at the said housing complex, had sold drugs to an individual residing in the Negombo area, and had later kidnapped his child over a failure of payment.

        "title": "8 dead in Utah murder-suicide after wife sought divorce",
        "date": "January 6, 2023 12:23 pm",
        "content": "A Utah man fatally shot his five children, his mother-in-law and his wife and then killed himself two weeks after the woman had filed for divorce, according to authorities and public records. Police also revealed during a Thursday news conference that officers investigated the 42-year-old man and his family a couple of years prior, suggesting possible earlier problems inside the household. Enoch Police Chief Jackson Ames did not elaborate. Investigators were aware of the divorce petition but didnt know if it was the motivation behind the killings, Mayor Geoffrey Chesnut said. The killings rocked the small town of Enoch in southern Utah about halfway between Salt Lake City and Las Vegas. Its in one of the fastest-growing areas of the country, and communities of new homes on big lots are made up primarily of large families that belong, like most in Utah, to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, known widely as the Mormon church. Many residents work and do business in nearby Cedar City, a city of about 35,000 that serves as a commercial hub for Enoch, which doesnt have its own downtown. The deceased were members of the faith and well known in town. Many residents served in church alongside members of the slain family or went to school with the children, city officials said. This is a tremendous blow to many families who have spent many nights with these individuals who are now gone, Chesnut said. City Manager Rob Dotson said people are feeling loss, theyre feeling pain and they have a lot of questions. Community members gathered Thursday evening to mourn and sing hymns in a private vigil at a church up the street from the home where the victims were found the previous day. Officials said they believe Michael Haight killed his wife, 40-year-old Tausha Haight; his mother-in-law; and the couples five children. Each appeared to have gunshot wounds. The three girls and two boys ranged in age from 4 to 17 and included 7-year-old twins, authorities said. Tausha Haights mother, 78-year-old Gail Earl, was said to have been staying with the family to help during a difficult time. Court records show that Tausha Haight filed for divorce Dec. 21. Her lawyer said Thursday that Haight had been served with the papers Dec. 27. The reasons for the divorce were unknown, in part because Utah law keeps details of divorce proceedings sealed from the public. Tausha Haight and other members of the family were seen the night before the killings at a church group for young women, Chesnut said. Police were dispatched to the familys home Wednesday afternoon for a welfare check after someone reported that she had missed an appointment earlier in the week, city officials said. Family mass killings have become a disturbingly common tragedy across the country. In 2022 there were 17 of them, according to a database compiled by USA Today, The Associated Press and Northeastern University. Ten were murder-suicides, and 14 were shootings. The database defines a mass killing as four or more people slain, not including the assailant. James Park, who represented Tausha Haight in the divorce case, said she had not expressed any fear that her husband would physically hurt her. Park declined to elaborate, citing the investigation into the killings. He said he met with Tausha Haight only twice, mostly recently on Tuesday, and she was an incredibly nice lady. The White House said in a statement that President Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden were mourning with the Enoch community. It called for further steps to reduce gun violence, now the leading cause of death for children in the U.S. The home where the victims were found was decorated with Christmas lights and located in a neighborhood of newly built single-family houses on a ridge overlooking Enoch. It has a view of houses with snow-covered roofs and mountains in the distance. Half the surrounding block was cordoned off by police tape. The Cedar City area, historically agricultural, is being transformed by new subdivisions. Cattle and sheep line the highway at the edge of town, along with signs that advertise Custom New Homes and recreation in southern Utahs famous national parks. Sharon Huntsman of Cedar City came to the neighborhood with a bouquet of white flowers Thursday morning. She said the deaths had deeply rattled Iron County and cried as she propped up the bouquet in the snow at a makeshift memorial where neighbors left stuffed animals and flowers. Its just one big community, she said. We all have one heavenly father. Archives from a local newspaper capture moments in Michael Haights life beginning with a picture of him laughing as a baby in an announcement marking his first birthday. He was in the Boy Scouts and went on a church mission in Brazil. In 2003, Haight married Tausha Earl at a church temple. She was from Overton, Nevada, about two hours south of Cedar City, where he grew up. As an adult, Haight worked as an insurance agent. Tausha Haights Facebook page showed pictures of the family looking happy in picturesque settings of Utah, and in front of a large statue of Jesus. Jennie Earl, who is Taushas sister-in-law and a member of the Utah State Board of Education, posted a photo on Facebook of Tausha and her children and wrote about the stiff competition to be their favorite aunt. I pray that Christs love will mend our broken hearts and fill us with forgiveness and peace, Earl wrote. She declined to comment when reached by The Associated Press. Community members who gathered at Enoch City Hall to listen to Thursdays news conference said it was wrenching to have to tell their own children that their peers may not be at school the next day. We told them last night, said city councilman Richard Jensen, a father of eight. We gathered them around for a family prayer type of thing. We told them a family in town, everyone had been killed and when they show up to school tomorrow its possible kids will be missing. Source - AP News - With input from agencies",

Colombo Additional Magistrate Tharanga Mahawatta issued the relevant order after considering the facts presented by the Criminal Investigation Department (CID). Amarasinghe was arrested by the CID last evening (05 Jan.) after recently making several controversial statements about the much-venerated Temple of the Sacred Tooth Relic in Kandy. The YouTubers recent claims have led to chaotic uproar amongst Sri Lankas predominantly Buddhist society, officials of the CID highlighted, while the Director General of Department of Archaeology also asserted that the slanderous statements in question were a grave wrongdoing. The Chief Prelates of the Malwatta and Asgiriya chapters have also informed the CID that they are ready to provide statements pertaining to the matter, the CID informed the court. Investigations have also revealed that Amarasinghe had received funds from persons overseas, regarding which the CID are conducting further probes under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, and the Act pertaining to providing financial aid to terrorists. The CID have requested that the accused be remanded till 19 January under the the International Convention on Civil and Political Rights. This request was, however, rejected. Appearing on behalf of Amarasinghe, Namal Rajapaksa stated that his client has only attempted to shield the religion from myths and other harmful statement through the countless number of videos posted on his YouTube channel, affirming that the accused had no intention of insulting Buddhism. Rajapaksa also levelled a serious accusation that Amarasinghe had been arrested for the purpose of gaining political revenge, stating that the controversial statements had only shed light on the fact that the Government was attempting to overshadow the ongoing economic crisis by readying to hold an exhibition of the Tooth Relic. The CID initiated investigations into the statements made by Amarasinghe after Inspector-General of Police (IGP) C.D.

        "date": "January 6, 2023 05:38 pm",
        "content": "(Reuters) - Sri Lanka will restart negotiations on trade pacts with India, China and Thailand after a four-hear hiatus, an official said on Thursday, as the crisis-hit country races to seal deals to help it rebuild its economy. The island of 22 million is in the midst of its worst financial crisis in over seven decades, triggered by a severe shortage of foreign exchange that has left the country struggling to pay for fuel, food and medicine. Officials from Thailand are scheduled to arrive in Sri Lanka on Monday to start the third round of talks after negotiations were suspended in 2018, said K.J. Weerasinghe, Sri Lankas Chief Negotiator of Free Trade Agreements (FTAs). Negotiations with India and China, Sri Lankas biggest trading partners accounting for about 5 billion each in bilateral trade in 2021, are expected to begin in February and March. The focus is on improving economic cooperation and attracting investment, which is crucial for Sri Lanka to emerge for this economic crisis, Weerasinghe told Reuters. My main goal is to have all these deals completed by the end of 2023 or early 2024. Auramon Supthaweethum, Director General of Thailands Department of Trade Negotiations, said talks had been delayed because of Sri Lankas economic crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic. We are heading there to continue the discussion, Supthaweethum said. Bilateral trade between Thailand and Sri Lanka totaled around 460 million in 2021, according to Sri Lankas central bank data. Sri Lanka is aiming to deepen an existing FTA with its northern neighbor India into a Economic and Technology Agreement after talks stalled in 2018. It is looking to add services and investment to the current agreement that primarily covers trade in goods. FTA discussions with China, the islands largest bilateral lender, also stalled in 2018 over disagreements about the pace of liberalizing of Sri Lankas economy, Weerasinghe said. Both countries have responded positively to resuming talks but specific dates are yet to be finalised, Weerasinghe added. Indias trade ministry and Chinas foreign ministry did not immediately respond to Reuters requests for comment. Sri Lankas economy is projected to have contracted by 8.7 in 2022, but a recovery is expected in the second half of 2023, the central bank said. The country signed a preliminary agreement for a 2.9 billion bailout package with the International Monetary Fund last September but has to put its debt on track before disbursements can begin.

The consignment is believed to have been imported from India, under the guise of importing white sugar, owing to the ongoing ban on the importation of brown sugar. Accordingly, a stock of 1,200 metric tonnes of white sugar had been imported, amidst which 600 metric tonnes of brown sugar was found. The entire consignment of sugar has been estimated at a value of Rs. 241 million, while the stock of brown sugar is due to be confiscated, authorities said. State Minister of Finance Ranjith Siyambalapitiya, too, inspected the sugar consignment in question with officials belonging to Sri Lanka Customs. During his inspection, Siyambalapitiya stated that there is a ban in place for the importation of brown sugar, as it is manufactured in Sri Lanka, thus nullifying the need to spend on its importation amidst Sri Lankas acute dollar crisis. Speaking to the media during his inspection, the State Minister urged the public to contact Sri Lanka Customs via their 24-hour hotline 011 2 481 471, or the Director General of Customs on 011 2 347 881 in the event any suspicions arise pertaining to the illegal stocks of sugar being sold.",

The breach will unfortunately lead to a lot of hacking, targeted phishing and doxxing, Alon Gal, co-founder of Israeli cybersecurity-monitoring firm Hudson Rock, wrote on LinkedIn on Wednesday. He called it one of the most significant leaks Ive seen. Twitter has not commented on the report, which Gal first posted about on social media on December 24, nor responded to inquiries about the breach since that date. It was not clear what action, if any, Twitter has taken to investigate or remediate the issue. The Reuters news agency could not independently verify that the data on the forum was authentic and came from Twitter. Screenshots of the hacker forum, where the data appeared on Wednesday, have circulated online. Troy Hunt, creator of breach-notification site Have I Been Pwned, viewed the leaked data and said on Twitter that it seemed pretty much what its been described as. There were no clues to the identity or location of the hacker or hackers behind the breach. It may have taken place as early as 2021, before Elon Musk took ownership of the company last year. Claims about the size and scope of the breach initially varied with early accounts in December, which said 400 million email addresses and phone numbers were stolen. A serious breach at Twitter may interest regulators on both sides of the Atlantic. The Data Protection Commission in Ireland, where Twitter has its European headquarters, and the United States Federal Trade Commission have been monitoring the Musk-owned company for compliance with European data protection rules and a US consent order respectively. Messages left with the two regulators were not immediately returned on Thursday. Source - Al Jazeera - With input from agencies",

        "date": "January 6, 2023 10:07 pm",
        "content": "(Reuters) - Nineteen suspected gang members and 10 military personnel were killed in a wave of violence surrounding the arrest of Mexican drug cartel boss Ovidio Guzman in the northern state of Sinaloa, Defense Minister Luis Cresencio Sandoval said on Friday. Mexican security forces on Thursday captured Guzman, a son of jailed kingpin Joaquin El Chapo Guzman. Members of the Sinaloa Cartel and their associates went on a rampage, fighting security forces, setting vehicles on fire and blocking roads across the Pacific coastal state. The violence was concentrated in and around Culiacan, the capital of Sinaloa, home of the powerful drug cartel that El Chapo headed before his 2016 capture and extradition to the United States in 2017. Twenty-one other people were arrested during Thursdays operations, Sandoval told a news conference. He said there were no reports of any civilian deaths. Ovidio Guzman, 32, was arrested in the early hours of Thursday, prompting a shootout with gang members, Sandoval said. Guzman was then extracted by helicopter from the house where he was caught and flown to Mexico City, the minister added. He is now being held in a maximum security federal prison. An enhanced security presence will remain in place in Sinaloa to protect the public, with an additional 1,000 military personnel traveling to the region today, Sandoval said. President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said no U.S forces had assisted in Ovidios capture. Culiacans airport remained closed on Friday, authorities said. A failed operation to detain Ovidio in 2019 ended in humiliation for the government of Lopez Obrador, after that arrest also triggered a violent backlash from cartel loyalists. At that time, Ovidio was quickly released to head off the threat of retribution from his cartel. Ovidios latest capture comes before a North American leaders summit in Mexico City next week, which U.S. President Joe Biden will attend. Cooperation over security is due to be on the agenda.

The shooting happened shortly after 14:00 local time (19:00 GMT) at Richneck Elementary School in the city of Newport News, Chief Steve Drew said. It is unclear how the child obtained the gun, but Mr Drew said the incident was not an accidental shooting. The teacher - who has not been named and is said to be in her 30s - was left with life-threatening injuries. She was taken to a local hospital and is being closely monitored by doctors. The incident took place in a first grade (ages six to seven) classroom after an altercation between the pair. But Mr Drew emphasised that the shooting had been an isolated incident and stressed that officers did not have a situation where someone was going around the school shooting. Officials said that while the school - which has around 550 students - had metal detection facilities, students were checked at random and not every child was inspected. Police declined to name the weapon used in the incident, but said the boy had used a handgun. School District Head Dr George Parker said officials would be looking at any instance that may have occurred that may have caused this incident. This is terrible, something like this should never occur, Dr Parker added. We want to ensure nothing like this happens again. He said the school would be closed on Monday, and pledged that students and parents would be offered support to help them deal with the traumatic event. Mayor Phillip Jones - who took office just three days ago - said the shooting marked a dark day for Newport News. Were going to learn from this and were going to come back stronger, he told reporters. Virginia Governor Glenn Youngkin said he had offered assistance to local officials, adding that his administration was ready to help in any way we can. I am continuing to monitor the situation and am praying for the continued safety of all students and the community, he wrote on Twitter.

        "title": "Kevin McCarthy elected Republican US House speaker",
        "date": "January 7, 2023 12:00 pm",
        "content": "Republican Kevin McCarthy was elected speaker of the US House of Representatives early on Saturday, after making extensive concessions to a group of right-wing hardliners that raised questions about the partys ability to govern. The 57-year-old Californian suffered one final humiliation when Representative Matt Gaetz withheld his vote on the 14th ballot as midnight approached, prompting a scuffle in which fellow Republican Mike Rogers had to be physically pulled away. McCarthys victory in the 15th ballot brought an end to the deepest congressional dysfunction in 160 years. But it sharply illustrated the difficulties that he will face in leading a narrow and deeply polarized majority. He won at last on a margin of 216-211. He was able to be elected with the votes of fewer than half the House members only because five in his own party withheld their votes - not backing McCarthy as leader, but also not voting for another contender. McCarthy agreed to a demand by hardliners that any lawmaker be able call for his removal at any time. That will sharply cut the power he will hold when trying to pass legislation on critical issues including funding the government, addressing the nations looming debt ceiling and other crises that may arise. We got the things that are transformational, said Republican Representative Ralph Norman, who voted to back McCarthy after opposing him for much of the week. Republicans weaker-than-expected performance in Novembers midterm elections left them with a narrow 222-212 majority, which has given outsized power to the right-wing hardliners who have opposed McCarthys leadership. Those concessions, including sharp spending cuts and other curbs on McCarthys leadership, could point to further turbulence in the months ahead, especially when Congress will need to sign off on a further increase of the United States 31.4 trillion borrowing authority. Over the past decade, Republicans have repeatedly shut down much of the government and pushed the worlds largest borrower to the brink of default in efforts to extract steep spending cuts, usually without success. Several of the hardliners have questioned McCarthys willingness to engage in such brinksmanship when negotiating with President Joe Biden, whose Democrats control the Senate.They have raged in the past when Senate Republicans led by Mitch McConnell agreed to compromise deals. The hardliners, also including Freedom Caucus Chairman Scott Perry and Chip Roy of Texas, said concessions they extracted from McCarthy will make it easier to pursue such tactics this year - or force another vote on McCarthys leadership if he does not live up to their expectations. You have changes in how were going to spend and allocate money that are going to be historic, said Representative Scott Perry, the chairman of the hard-right House Freedom Caucus. We dont want clean debt ceilings to just go through and just keep paying the bill without some counteracting effort to control spending when the Democrats control the White House and control the Senate. In a sharp contrast to this weeks battles among House Republicans, Biden and McConnell appeared together in Kentucky on Wednesday to highlight investments in infrastructure. Democrats worried that the concessions McCarthy agreed to could lead to sharp cuts to popular social programs. This is bad, said Democratic Representative Lori Trahan. Kevin McCarthy sold out Medicare and Social Security recipients to pick up speaker votes from right-wing Republicans. McCarthys belated victory came on the two-year anniversary of a Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, when a violent mob stormed Congress in an attempt to overturn then-President Donald Trumps election loss. This weeks 13 failed votes marked the highest number of ballots for the speakership since 1859, in the turbulent years before the Civil war. McCarthys last bid for speaker, in 2015, crumbled in the face of right-wing opposition. The two previous Republican speakers, John Boehner and Paul Ryan, left the job after conflict with right-wing colleagues. Wielding the speakers gavel will give McCarthy the authority to block Bidens legislative agenda, force votes for Republican priorities on the economy, energy and immigration and move forward with investigations of Biden, his administration and his family. Concessions But McCarthy has agreed to concessions that mean he will hold considerably less power than his predecessor, Democrat Nancy Pelosi, according to sources involved in the talks. That will make it hard for him to agree to deals with Democrats in a divided Washington. Allowing a single member to call for a vote to remove the speaker will give hardliners extraordinary leverage. He has also offered influential committee posts to members of the group, lawmakers said, as well as spending restrictions that aim to reach a balanced budget within 10 years. The agreement would cap spending for the next fiscal year at last years levels - amounting to a significant cut when inflation and population growth are taken into account. That could meet resistance from more centrist Republicans or those who have pushed for greater military funding, particularly as the United States is spending money to help Ukraine fend off a Russian assault. Moderate Republican Brian Fitzpatrick said he was not worried that the House would effectively be run by hardliners. Its aspirational, he told reporters. We still have our voting cards.

        "date": "January 7, 2023 07:38 pm",
        "content": "An audit report submitted by the Auditor General about the 2020 annual report of the State Pharmaceuticals Corporation (SPC) has disclosed irregularities in the purchase of dopamine and epoetin. As per the SPCs annual report, the Medical Supplies Division (MSD) of the Health Ministry, in accordance with the international competitive bidding system, had called bids for the purchase of 120,000 ampoules of dopamine of 5ml to treat heart patients. Subsequently, the MSD had awarded the bid to a selected supplier to procure one ampoule of dopamine for a price of Rs. 33.43. The report mentions that a total amount of Rs. 4 million (Rs. 4,011,600) had been allocated for the purchase of 120,000 ampoules in total. However, as the order was delayed, the MSD went on to purchase 12,994 of ampoules of dopamine of 5ml from the local agent of the main supplier for Rs. 940 each. At the same time, 14,995 more ampoules of another drug had been purchased from another supplier and the total cost for both purchases amounted to Rs 26 million (Rs. 26,309,660). It is reported that the Technical Evaluation Committee and the Procurement Committee had overlooked the difference between the total procurement cost and the initial allocation made for the purchase. Meanwhile, the additional cost of Rs. 23 million (Rs. 23,231,048) which was incurred due to the supply delays as a result of a fault on the part of the main supplier had not been recovered either. Further, it was revealed that purchase order had been awarded to the main supplier despite its unwillingness to test the dopamine samples at the SPCs laboratory instead of at an SPC-approved Indian laboratory. The audit report also shows that although the ampoules purchased from the local agent were required to have a shelf life of at least 12 months at the time it is provided to the MSD, the shelf life had been mentioned as 10 months. It also threw light on a sum to the tune of Rs. 44 million (Rs. 44,640,750) spent under emergency purchases for the procurement of 7,000 syringes of epoetin 1000IU for kidney patients. Completion of the procurement process has taken nearly 2 years although it was supposed to be completed within a period of 8 weeks, resulting in an additional cost of over Rs. 1 million (Rs. 1,179,757) which was incurred due to the continued depreciation of Sri Lankan rupee against the US dollar. In 2018, the Hambantota District General Hospital and the Colombo South Teaching Hospital had requested 3,000 of these syringes for their estimated requirement, none of these two hospitals had received a single syringe up until July 06, 2020. It was also revealed that 5,612 other syringes had been in storage at the MSD without being distributed while only 1,388 were provided to 10 hospitals which had not submitted their estimated epoetin syringe requirement. According to the report, this drug had been procured at a time when there was no urgency.",

        "title": "Iran executes two more men detained in connection with nationwide protests",
        "date": "January 7, 2023 08:36 pm",
        "content": "Iran on Saturday executed two men for killing a paramilitary force member during unprecedented protests sparked by the death in custody of a young woman. The latest hangings double the number of executions to four over the nationwide protests, which escalated since mid-September into calls for an end to Irans clerical regime. Two men were put to death in December, sparking global outrage and new Western sanctions against Iran. Judicial news agency Mizan Online reported Mohammad Mehdi Karami and Seyed Mohammad Hosseini, the main perpetrators of the crime that led to the martyrdom of Ruhollah Ajamian, were hanged this morning. Prosecutors said the 27-year-old militiaman was stripped naked and killed by a group of mourners who had been paying tribute to a slain protester, Hadis Najafi. The executions come in defiance of a campaign by international rights groups for the lives of the two men to be spared. Karamis father had also begged the judiciary not to kill his son. Mahmood Amiry-Moghaddam, director of Oslo-based group Iran Human Rights (IHR), said both men were subjected to torture, sentenced after sham trials... without the minimum standards for due process. Like other activists, he called for stronger international action after the latest executions. On Twitter, Amiry-Moghaddam specifically urged new and stronger sanctions against individuals and entities. Authorities have arrested thousands of people in the wave of demonstrations that began with the September death in custody of Mahsa Amini, 22. The Iranian Kurdish woman had been arrested by morality police for allegedly breaching the regimes strict dress code for women. Fear for others Ajamian belonged to the Basij paramilitary force linked to the powerful Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. He died in Karaj, west of Tehran, on November 3 after being attacked with knives, stones, fists, kicks and dragged along a street, a judiciary spokesman said at the time. The court of first instance had sentenced Karami and Hosseini to death in early December, Mizan said. On Tuesday the Supreme Court upheld the sentence. Karamis parents had in December issued a video pleading with the judiciary to spare his life. I respectfully ask the judiciary, I beg you please, I ask you... to remove the death penalty from my sons case, said Mashallah Karami, describing his son as a former national karate team member. Karamis father told Iranian media that a family lawyer had not been able to access his sons case file. Mohamad Aghasi, whom the family wanted to handle the case, wrote on Twitter that Karami had not been allowed to have a final meeting with his family and had foregone food and water in protest. IHR gave Karamis age as 22. Hossein was 39, according to another Norway-based rights group, Hengaw. They were among 14 people courts have sentenced to death over the unrest, according to an AFP count based on official information. Four have now been executed, two others have had their sentences confirmed by the Supreme Court, six are awaiting new trials and two others can appeal. Dozens of other protesters face charges punishable by death, IHR said in late December. British actor of Iranian origin Nazanin Boniadi, an ambassador for Amnesty International in the United Kingdom, said on Twitter that the political cost of Iran executions must increase. Foreign nations must withdraw their ambassadors from Iran and call for a moratorium on executions and state violence against peaceful dissent, New York-based Center for Human Rights in Iran said. We are mourning as a nation, prominent US-based dissident Masih Alinejad said in a Twitter post. Help us save others. Even more hardliners Nearly four months into the authorities crackdown on the unrest triggered by Aminis death, supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on Saturday appointed a new police chief. General Ahmad-Reza Radan took over from Hossein Ashtari, said a statement posted on the leaders official website. Khamenei ordered the police to improve its capabilities. Iran expert Mehrzad Boroujerdi said before the announcement there had been rumours that Khamenei has severely criticised the performance of Hossein Ashtari. Boroujerdi, vice provost and dean of Missouri STs College of Arts, Sciences, and Education, told AFP on Wednesday that he expected people like Ashtari to be replaced by even more hardliners to maintain a tight grip of the security forces. The latest executions were the first linked to the demonstrations in almost a month. Iranian officials describe the protests as riots and accuse hostile foreign powers and opposition groups of stoking the unrest. On December 12 Majidreza Rahnavard, 23, was hanged publicly from a crane after his conviction for killing two members of the security forces, Mizan reported. Rahnavards execution came four days after Mohsen Shekari, also 23, was put to death in connection with the wounding of a security forces member. Source - AFP - With input from agencies",

        "content": "India prevailed over Sri Lanka by 91 runs in the final T20 International played in Rajkot, India today (07 Jan.), winning the three-match series 2-1. Winning the toss and electing to bat first, India put up a score of 228 for the loss of five wickets, with Suryakumar Yadav, ranked ICCs top T20 batsman, scoring a stunning 112 from 51 deliveries. Despite having had a daunting chase of 229 runs, Sri Lankas opening duo Kusal Mendis and Pathum Nissanka got them off to a decent start securing 38 runs amongst the duo. However once Mendiss wicket fell, the Lions lost their next few wickets at regular intervals, unable to keep a single solid stand amongst the remaining partnerships. Sri Lanka lost the final match of the three-day T20I series with a score of 137 under their belt for the loss of nine wickets, with only bowler Kasun Rajitha remaining on the field. India have sealed the deal with this win, maintaining their record of winning every T20I series played against Sri Lanka in India.",

        "date": "January 7, 2023 11:56 pm",
        "content": "The Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) has decided to impose restrictions on the availability of the Standing Facilities to Licensed Commercial Banks (LCBs) under the Open Market Operations (OMOs) of CBSL, without considering market-based funding options to address their structural liquidity needs. Accordingly, effective from 16 January, the Standing Deposit Facility (SDF) -- the overnight deposit facility that allows LCBs to park excess liquidity and earn interest -- will be limited to a maximum of five (05) times per calendar month. Meanwhile, the Standing Lending facility (SLF), which is the collateralized facility provided for LCBs to fulfill any further shortage of the liquidity requirements from the Central Bank at the end of the day, would also be limited to 90 of the Statutory Reserve Requirement (SRR) of each LCB at any given day. The decision was reached after it was observed that several LCBs have continued to depend excessively on the overnight Standing Facilities under CBSLs OMOs, CBSL stated in a notice issued in this regard. Although OMOs have been made available to be used as fallback options after utilizing all other funding options, CBSL noted that as several of these LCBs show no signs of adapting to remedial measures in this regard, such actions continue to affect the efforts of the Central Bank to reactivate the money markets. Such LCBs also stand to pose a threat to the smooth channeling of funds in the economy with a possibility of clogging the payment and settlement systems, CBSL warned.",

        "content": "Renovating the Maho-Omanthai stretch of the Northern Railway Line, which had been overlooked for years, commenced today (Jan 08) at the Medawachchiya railway station. It is estimated that it would take at least 05 months to complete the renovations. Hence, the Kankesanturai-bound trains from Colombo Fort will travel only up to Anuradhapura railway station until the completion of the upgrading of the tracks, according to the Department of Railways. Accordingly, trains will not be up and running on the Anuradhapura-Vavuniya stretch of the Northern Railway Line during this period. Upgrading of the railway tracks is handled by Indias state-run Indian Railway Construction International (IRCON), under an Indian credit line of USD 91.27 million. Under the first phase of this project, a stretch of 48km on the railway line from Anuradhapura to Vavuniya will be renovated, and subsequently, a stretch of 31km up to Omanthai will be upgraded. Following its completion, trains can be operated at a speed of 100kmph and the duration of the journey is expected to be reduced by one hour. While the Anuradhapura-Omanthai stretch of the railway line remains closed for five months, the Transport  Highways Ministry will take measures to provide necessary public transport facilities to the general public by deploying SLTB and privately-owned buses between these two destinations. Meanwhile, Minister of Transport  Highways Bandula Gunawardena engaged in religious observations at the Jaya Sri Maha Bodhiya in Anuradhapura, prior to the commencement of the renovations. He was joined by Indian High Commissioner to Sri Lanka Gopal Baglay, the general manager of railways and several ministerial officials. The lawmaker appreciated the continued support India has provided to Sri Lanka during challenging times. Commenting on the matter, the Indian envoy stated that this would further strengthen the friendship between the two nations and help provide efficient public transportation service to the people of Sri Lanka.",

        "date": "January 8, 2023 10:22 am",
        "content": "Travellers began streaming across land and sea crossings from Hong Kong to mainland China on Sunday, many eager for long-awaited reunions, as Beijing opened borders that have been all but shut since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. After three years, the mainland is opening its border with Hong Kong and ending a requirement for incoming travellers to quarantine, dismantling a final pillar of a zero-COVID policy that had shielded Chinas people from the virus but also cut them off from the rest of the world. Chinas easing over the past month of one of the worlds tightest COVID regimes followed historic protests against a policy that included frequent testing, curbs on movement and mass lockdowns that heavily damaged the second-biggest economy. Im so happy, so happy, so excited. I havent seen my parents for many years, said Hong Kong resident Teresa Chow as she and dozens of other travellers prepared to cross into mainland China from Hong Kongs Lok Ma Chau checkpoint early on Sunday. My parents are not in good health, and I couldnt go back to see them even when they had colon cancer, so Im really happy to go back and see them now, she said, adding that she plans to head to her hometown in eastern Chinas Ningbo city. Investors hope the reopening will eventually reinvigorate a 17-trillion economy suffering its lowest growth in nearly half a century. But the abrupt policy reversal has triggered a massive wave of infections that is overwhelming some hospitals and causing business disruptions. The border opening follows Saturdays start of chun yun, the first 40-day period of Lunar New Year travel, which before the pandemic was the worlds largest annual migration of people returning to their hometowns of taking holidays with family. Some 2 billion people are expected to travel this season, nearly double last years movement and recovering to 70 of 2019 levels, the government says. Many Chinese are also expected to start travelling abroad, a long-awaited shift for tourist spots in countries such as Thailand and Indonesia, though several governments - worried about Chinas COVID spike - are imposing curbs on travellers from the country. Travel will not quickly return to pre-pandemic levels due to such factors as a dearth of international flights, analysts say. China on Sunday also resumed issuing passports and travel visas for mainland residents, and ordinary visas and residence permits for foreigners. Beijing has quotas on the number of people who can travel between Hong Kong and China each day. Videos posted on Chinese social media showed workers at Shanghais Pudong airport overnight taking down bright blue boards marking routes through its international terminal to enforce a regime that required travellers from abroad to quarantine for up to eight days upon arrival. Other videos showed people hugging emotionally upon reuniting at the airport gate. At Hong Kongs Lok Ma Chau checkpoint, a driver who only gave his surname Yip, said he was among those who could not wait to travel to the mainland. Its been three years, we have no time to delay, he said. Source - Reuters -Agencies",

        "date": "January 8, 2023 12:54 pm",
        "content": "Russias overnight bombing of regions in eastern Ukraine killed at least one, local officials said on Sunday, after Moscow ended a self-declared Christmas ceasefire and vowed to push on with combat until it reaches a victory over its neighbour. President Vladimir Putin ordered on Friday a 36-hour ceasefire along the line of contact to observe Russia and Ukraines Orthodox Christmas, which fell on Saturday. Ukraine had rejected the truce, and there was shelling along the frontline. A 50-year-old man died in the northeastern region of Kharkiv as a result of Russias shelling, Oleh Sinehubov, the governor of the region said on the Telegram messaging app. The news came minutes after midnight in Moscow. Most Ukrainian Orthodox Christians have traditionally celebrated Christmas on Jan. 7, as have Orthodox Christians in Russia. But this year, the Orthodox Church of Ukraine, the countrys largest, allowed also for a Dec. 25 celebration. Still, many observed the holiday on Saturday, flocking into churches and cathedrals. The Kremlin said that Moscow will press ahead with what it calls a special military operation in Ukraine and which Kyiv and its Western allies call an unprovoked aggression to grab land. The tasks set by the president (Putin) for the special military operation will still be fulfilled, the Russian state TASS agency quoted Putins first deputy chief of staff, Sergei Kiriyenko, as saying. And there definitely will be a victory. There is no end in sight to the war, now in its 11th month, which has killed thousands, displaced millions and turned Ukrainian cities into rubble. Ukrainian officials also reported blasts in regions that make up the broader Donbas region - the wars frontline where fighting has been raging for months. Pavlo Kyrylenko, governor of the Donetsk region in Ukraine, said that there were nine missile strikes on the region overnight, including seven on the battered city of Kramatorsk. According to preliminary information, there were no casualties. Blasts were also heard in the city of Zaporizhzhia, the administrative centre of the Zaporizhzhia region, a local official said, without giving any immediate report on damage or casualties. Ukraines President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Wednesday that Russia is planning a major new offensive. The Pentagon said on Friday that Putins aim of seizing Ukrainian territory has not changed, even if his military continues to suffer blows. Theres been growing concerns that Belarus - a staunch backer of Moscow - could be used as a staging post to attack Ukraine from the north after increasing military activity in the country and fresh transfer of Russian troops there. Unofficial Telegram channels monitoring military activity in Belarus reported late on Saturday that some 1,400-1,600 Russian troops arrived from Russia into the northeastern city of Vitebsk in Belarus over the past two days. Reuters was not able to independently verify the information. Source - Reuters -Agencies",

        "content": "The third round of negotiations between Sri Lanka and Thailand on the proposed Free Trade Agreement (FTA) is scheduled to be held on January 09 and 10 in Colombo, the Presidents Media Division (PMD) said today. Attended by 26 official delegates from Thailand, led by Ms. Auramon Supthaweethum, the Director General of the Department of Trade Negotiations, the discussions will advance the governments agenda of expanding the market access for Sri Lankan exports, the PMD said further in its statement. Seven topics trade in goods, trade in services, investments, rules of origin, custom cooperation, trade facilitation, and economic cooperation will be the focus of the negotiations. The start of the negotiations will take place against the backdrop of a significant trade imbalance in Thailands favour. In 2021, Sri Lanka imported goods from Thailand worth USD 355 million, but only sent USD 59 million to Thailand. Thus, from the perspective of Sri Lanka, the negotiations will be aimed at enhancing access to Sri Lankas exports not only in the Thai market but also in markets in other ASIAN countries through Thailands gateway and lowering current non-tariff trade obstacles to trade. According to market potential assessments, Sri Lankan exports of precious stones, black tea, and other goods have a lot of promise. Sri Lanka is hopeful that via successful discussions, doors can be created to offer opportunities in both the new industries and for the two nations current trade frameworks. The National Trade Negotiating Committee (NTNC), whose members primarily represent the Ministries of Foreign Affairs, Trade, Commerce, and Food Security, the Department of Trade  Investment Policy of the Treasury, and the Department of Commerce, will participate in the negotiations on behalf of Sri Lanka under the leadership of Mr. K.J. Weerasinghe, Chief Negotiator, and the Presidential Secretariat. In the first quarter of 2024, the government plans to put this agreement into operation. The NTNC will give the specific requests made by the regional business associationschambers considerable consideration during the negotiations. The governments objective of entering the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, which represents 30 of the global population and economy, will be advanced by this agreement. Since trade is a growth tool that is relevant to both countries, the government of Sri Lanka is eager to strengthen the bilateral relationship with Thailand. Thailand and Sri Lanka have formal diplomatic relations that date back 68 years, and Thailands economy was especially boosted by the rapid growth of manufactured exports. -PMD",

        "date": "January 8, 2023 04:45 pm",
        "content": "The billionaire founder of Ant Group, Jack Ma, is to give up control of the Chinese fintech giant after a regulatory crackdown. Ant Group said that after the change no-one would have overall control. The formerly flamboyant Mr Ma has seldom been seen in public since criticising Chinas financial sector in 2020. Following that criticism, Ant Groups planned stock market flotation was abruptly halted. Ant Group runs Alipay, the main online payment system in China, which has eclipsed cash, cheques and credit cards. Mr Ma, a former English teacher who founded e-commerce giant Alibaba, directly and indirectly controls more than 50 of Ant Group. However, after the changes in governance structure, he will control just over 6, according to an Ant Group statement. In November 2020 Ants 26bn stock market flotation, which would have been the worlds largest, was cancelled at the last minute. At the eleventh hour Chinese authorities cited major issues over regulating the firm. Some analysts saw it as an attempt by the Chinese government to humble a company that had become too powerful and a leader who had become too outspoken. The regulatory intervention came after Mr Ma had told a financial conference that traditional banks had a pawn-shop mentality. He also lauded the merits of the digital banking system, and stressed that future lending decisions should be based on data, not collateral. Why did Alibabas Jack Ma disappear for three months? After the collapse of the stock market flotation, which was set to make Mr Ma the richest person in China, he disappeared for three months, prompting speculation as to his whereabouts. He eventually resurfaced, according to reports, but has been avoiding the spotlight since then. Ant moves Mr Ma controls Ant through his stake and by acting in concert with other shareholders. But Ant said shareholders had agreed to no longer act together when using voting rights, and would only vote independently. The shareholding structure will also change. However, Ant said shareholders economic interests would not change. Jack Mas departure from Ant Financial, a company he founded, shows the determination of the Chinese leadership to reduce the influence of large private investors, said Andrew Collier, managing director of Orient Capital Research. This trend will continue the erosion of the most productive parts of the Chinese economy. Ant Group is nearing the completion of a two-year restructuring which has been driven by regulators, and Chinese authorities are poised to impose a fine of more than 1bn on the firm, according to the Reuters news agency. The expected penalty is part of a sweeping crackdown on Chinas technology giants over the past two years that has cut hundreds of billions of dollars off their values and shrunk revenues and profits. However, the authorities have softened their tone recently amid efforts to bolster the Chinese economy, which has been hit by the Covid pandemic. Source - BBC -Agencies",

Apart from that, there is no personal conflict between the current president and me. The problem today is that the new generation does not know what the Bandaranaike philosophy is. The people in the Aragalaya protest movement, knowingly or unknowingly, demanded that the country should be governed according to Bandaranaikes philosophy.

As part of its Neighbourhood First policy, India has extended multi-pronged assistance to Sri Lanka to help the country tide over its worst economic and humanitarian crisis since its independence from Great Britain in 1948. Supporting mobility and accessibility in Sri Lanka, High Commissioner handed over 75 buses for use by Transport Board. 500 buses are being supplied to Sri Lanka through Indian assistance towards strengthening public transport infrastructure, the Indian High Commission said in a statement. In a similar move, India handed 125 SUVs to the Sri Lanka Police under a line of credit in December to support the island nation and help it address the serious mobility restriction issues faced by the police, due to the non-availability of vehicles. The Sri Lankan government in May last year declared a debt default on over 51 billion in the foreign loan  a first in the countrys history. Extending a much-needed lifeline to a neighbour in need, India gave financial assistance of nearly 4 billion to Colombo during the year. In January, India announced a 900 million loan to Sri Lanka to build up its depleted foreign reserves as the financial crisis began to unfold. Later, it offered a 500 million credit line to Sri Lanka to fund the countrys fuel purchases. The credit line was later expanded to 700 million due to the sheer gravity of the situation. The Indian credit lines since early 2022 have been in use to import essentials and fuel after street protests erupted due to severe shortages of essentials. Source - PTI -Agencies",

The crash, one of the deadliest in the West African countrys recent memory, was on one of the main east-west arteries near the town of Kaffrine, about 220 kilometres (137 miles) southeast of the capital Dakar. Sall said on Twitter that he was profoundly saddened by the accident and announced three days of mourning starting on Monday.

The man had been plotting to use cyanide and ricin to commit a serious act of violence, North Rhine-Westphalia police said in a statement. They raided the mans Castrop-Rauxel residence, in the Ruhr region, but prosecutors said no poison was found. The suspects brother was also arrested and the pair remains in custody. While they did not find poison, police did seize electronic devices from the residence. A D√ºsseldorf senior public prosecutor said the tip-off about the man came from a friendly foreign intelligence service. After an evaluation of the information, we came to the conclusion to issue a search warrant and carry it out as soon as possible, Holger Heming told reporters. Germanys Deutsche-Presse Agence (dpa) reported numerous emergency workers in protective suits attending the scene. The investigation is continuing and it was initially unclear how far the attack plans had progressed. Mr Heming said he would not speculate on the possible target of the suspected attack and that police would decide whether to issue an official arrest warrant at a later date. The charge of a serious act of violence endangering the state is punishable by a prison sentence of between six months and 10 years. Germany has been the target of numerous Islamist attacks in recent years. In 2016, a truck attack on Christmas markets in Berlin killed 12 people and left dozens injured. Source  BBC -Agencies",

        "date": "January 9, 2023 07:59 am",
        "content": "Supporters of former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro who refuse to accept his election defeat stormed Congress, the Supreme Court and presidential palace in the capital on Sunday, a week after the inauguration of his leftist rival, President Luiz In√°cio Lula da Silva. Thousands of demonstrators bypassed security barricades, climbed on roofs, smashed windows and invaded all three buildings, which were believed to be largely vacant and sit on Brasilias vast Three Powers Square. Some of them called for a military intervention to either restore the far-right Bolsonaro to power, or oust Lula from the presidency. In a news conference from Sao Paulo state, Lula said Bolsonaro had encouraged the uprising by those he termed fascist fanatics, and he read a freshly signed decree for the federal government to take control of security in the federal district. There is no precedent for what they did and these people need to be punished, Lula said. TV channel Globo News showed protesters wearing the green and yellow colours of the national flag that also have come to symbolise the nations conservative movement, and were adopted by Bolsonaros supporters. The former president has repeatedly sparred with Supreme Court justices, and the room where they convene was trashed by the rioters. They sprayed fire hoses inside the Congress building and ransacked offices at the presidential palace. Windows were broken in all of the buildings. Bolsonaro, who flew to Florida ahead of Lulas inauguration, has not commented on Sundays events. Police fired tear gas in their efforts to recover the buildings, and were shown on television in the late afternoon marching protesters down a ramp from the presidential palace with their hands secured behind their backs. By early evening, control of the buildings had been reestablished, Justice Minister Flavio Dino said in a press conference that roughly 200 people had been arrested, and officers were firing more tear gas to drive lingering protesters from the area. But with the damage already done, many in Brazil were questioning how the police had ignored abundant warnings, were unprepared or were somehow complicit. Lula said at his news conference there was incompetence or bad faith on the part of police, and that they had been likewise complacent when Bolsonaro supporters rioted in the capital weeks ago. He promised those officers would be punished and expelled from the corps. The incident recalled the Jan. 6, 2021, assault on the US Capitol by supporters of then-President Donald Trump. Political analysts have warned for months that a similar storming was a possibility in Brazil, given that Bolsonaro has sown doubt about the reliability of the nations electronic voting system  without any evidence. The results were recognised as legitimate by politicians from across the spectrum, including some Bolsonaro allies, as well as dozens of foreign governments. Unlike the 2021 attack in the US, it is likely that few officials were working in the Brazilian Congress and Supreme Court on a Sunday. US President Joe Biden told reporters that the riots in Brazil were outrageous. His national security adviser Jake Sullivan went a step further on Twitter and said the US condemns any effort to undermine democracy in Brazil. Biden later tweeted that he looked forward to continuing to work with Lula, calling the riots an assault on democracy and on the peaceful transfer of power in Brazil. British Foreign Secretary James Cleverly tweeted: The violent attempts to undermine democracy in Brazil are unjustifiable. President LulaOficial and the government of Brazil have the full support of the UK. Earlier videos on social media showed a limited presence of the capitals military police; one showed officers standing by as people flooded into Congress, with one using his phone to record images. The capitals security secretariat didnt respond to a request from The Associated Press for comment about the relative absence of the police. Brazilian authorities had two years to learn the lessons from the Capitol invasion and to prepare themselves for something similar in Brazil, said Maur√≠cio Santoro, political science professor at the State University of Rio de Janeiro. Local security forces in Brasilia failed in a systematic way to prevent and to respond to extremist actions in the city. And the new federal authorities, such as the ministers of justice and of defense, were not able to act in a decisive way. Federal District Gov. Ibaneis Rocha confirmed on Twitter he had fired the capital citys head of public security, Anderson Torres. Local media reported that Torres is currently in the US The office of Lulas attorney general asked the Supreme Court to order Torres imprisonment. Bolsonaro supporters have been protesting Lulas electoral win since Oct 30, blocking roads, setting vehicles on fire and gathering outside military buildings, urging the armed forces to intervene. The head of Brazils electoral authority rejected the request from Bolsonaro and his political party to nullify ballots cast on most electronic voting machines. Two years since Jan 6, Trumps legacy continues to poison our hemisphere, US Sen Bob Menendez, who chairs the Senates foreign relations committee, tweeted, adding that he blamed Bolsonaro for inciting the acts. Protecting democracy  holding malign actors to account is essential. (AP) --Agencies",

        "date": "January 9, 2023 11:34 am",
        "content": "Sri Lankas recovery from last years devastating economic crisis will need its creditors to share the burden of debt restructuring, leading global economists have said, calling all lenders to cancel the debt of the cash-strapped island nation. In a statement issued on Sunday, eminent economists and scholars world over observed that amid Sri Lankas crucial debt negotiations, all lenders  bilateral, multilateral, and private  must share the burden of restructuring, with assurance of additional financing in the near term. However, Sri Lanka own cannot ensure this on its own, they noted. It requires much greater international support. Instead of geopolitical manoeuvring, all of Sri Lankas creditors must ensure debt cancellation sufficient to provide a way out of the current crisis, the statement said. The nearly 200 signatories to the statement included economists Jayati Ghosh, Thomas Piketty, Yanis Varoufakis, Prabhat Patnaik, Utsa Patnaik, Jean Dr√®ze, Ha-Joon Chang, Jomo Kwame Sundaram, and writer Amitav Ghosh. Their call comes months after Sri Lanka embarked on debt restructuring talks with its diverse group of creditors, including China, Japan and India, its three major bilateral lenders. Their financing assurances are crucial to Sri Lanka obtaining a 2.9 billion package from the IMF. As the import-reliant island nations Balance of Payments crisis spiralled and led to a painful economic crash last year, the government opted for a preemptive default on its 51 billion foreign debt in April 2022. The senior academics held Sri Lankas private creditors responsible for the countrys first ever default, arguing: Such lenders charged a premium to lend to Sri Lanka to cover their risks, which accrued them massive profits and contributed to the default. Private creditors own nearly 40 of Sri Lankas external debt stock mostly in the form of International Sovereign Bonds (ISBs), but higher interest rates mean that they receive over 50 of external debt payments, they pointed out. The default move came while crippling shortages sparked mass street protests across the island. The agitations spanned months and ousted former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa in July 2022. President Ranil Wickremesinghe was elected in his place, through a Parliament vote. In September 2022, Sri Lanka reached a staff level agreement with the IMF for a provisional bailout package, that the Fund made contingent on adequate financing assurances from Sri Lankas creditors. His government has pinned its hopes on IMF support, mainly to qualify for more credit that it deems necessary for reviving its battered economy. However, Sri Lanka missed the December deadline to obtain the IMF Boards approval, and is still in talks with creditors to obtain assurances. Governor of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka Nandalal Weerasinghe told The Hindu in December 2022, that Colombo had provided all information possible to its bilateral creditors and was awaiting assurances from India and China.

Meanwhile, the investigation officers of the SLBFE have raided an illegal foreign employment agency, according to a complaint received by the Special Investigations Unit of the SLBFE that the agency has defrauded an amount of Rs. 450,000 from a youth who was promised employment in Dubai. The concerned youth, who is a resident of the Thirukkovil area, had complained to the SLBFE that he was not provided with the job as promised. At the time of the raid, there had been two young women at the office, and they have been released after obtaining statements.

        "date": "January 9, 2023 01:33 pm",
        "content": "The Conservator General of Forests, K.M.A Bandara has refuted media reports implying that Sri Lankas forest cover has reduced to 16. He said this in response to a query made regarding the media report on the instructions of Presidents Secretary Saman Ekanayake, the Presidents Media Division (PMD) reported. The Presidential Secretariat had focused its attention regarding these reports published in the media, it added. The assessment of forest cover is carried out every five years and the census conducted in 2020 is scheduled to be completed in June this year. According to the census conducted in 2015, the natural forests of Sri Lanka stood at 29.15 (1,912,970 hectares) of the total land extent, according to the PMD. The Conservator General of Forests also said that although there has been some reduction in the amount of forests due to various development activities and other human activities in the country, there has definitely been no decrease in the amount of forests up to 16 as stated in the media reports. According to media reports, if the forest area in Sri Lanka is 16 of the total land extent, then the existing forest area in the country should be 1,040,000 hectares. This means that 872,970 hectares of forests should have been destroyed during the seven years from 2015, which is 124,710 hectares per year and 341 hectares of forest destruction per day, it mentioned further. He also said that the method used to assess the forests should have been described in the presentation of data on forests. Basic points such as the definition of forests, the method of estimating forest size, and the estimation of forest size should have been mentioned in the report. However, there is no source from which the relevant data was obtained in the media reports suggesting that the forest cover had decreased. The Conservator General further stated that if there is widespread forest destruction, as reported in the media, it should have been observed by the Department of Forest, the Department of Wildlife Conservation, the Sri Lanka Police, and the Sri Lanka Air Force, which monitors forests from the air. However, such extensive forest destruction has not been reported to any of these institutions. He also stated that the Forest Department is updating forest maps and that no such forest destruction was observed during those activities. --PMD--",
