        "title": "Former Pakistani PM Nawaz Sharif to seek fourth term in office",
        "date": "December 27, 2023 05:34 pm",
        "content": "Former Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif will seek a fourth term in office, his party said Wednesday, noting he would be its consensus candidate in the upcoming parliamentary elections and the office of the prime minister. Sharif, who has served as prime minister three times, returned to Pakistan in October after four years of self-exile in London to avoid serving prison sentences on corruption charges. However, his conviction and sentences were overturned on appeal after his return, making him eligible to run for a seat in the parliament, which will elect the new prime minister after the Feb. 8 vote. There is no doubt about it. Nawaz Sharif is our candidate for the office of the prime minister, said Rana Sanaullah Khan, a senior leader in Sharifs party. Sharif stepped down as prime minister in 2017 over the corruption charges. In July 2018, he was sentenced to 10 years in prison over purchases of luxury apartments in London. In December that year, he was sentenced to a further seven years for failing to disclose how his family set up steel mills in 1999. Sharifs main rival, Imran Khan, is currently serving a prison term, but he too has announced plans to contest the elections. Khan was ousted in a no-confidence vote in April 2022, but he remains a leading figure and his Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf party has a large following. Also Wednesday, police arrested one of Khans deputies, Shah Mahmood Qureshi, in Rawalpindi under a law that allows authorities to detain anyone to maintain law and order in the country. A video showed police pushing Qureshi toward an armored vehicle as he shouted that he was being arrested unjustly. The arrest came days after the Supreme Court granted bail to Qureshi and Khan in a case related to the leaking of official government secrets. But because Khan is in prison for a graft case, he will not be released. Khan and Qureshi are accused of revealing the contents of a classified cable that was sent to Islamabad by Pakistans ambassador in Washington when Khan was in power. Both deny they disclosed the cables contents. Source: Associated Press -Agencies",

        "title": "President invites all political parties to help stabilize economy and address ethnic issue",
        "date": "December 27, 2023 06:08 pm",
        "content": "In a significant announcement at the centenary celebration of Badulla Guruthalawa Muslim Central College this morning (27 Dec.), President Ranil Wickremesinghe highlighted two critical challenges facing the nation, building a stable economy and addressing the ethnic problem. The President extended an open invitation to all political parties again, urging them to join hands in achieving these goals, irrespective of party affiliations. President Wickremesinghe emphasized his commitment to safeguarding the rights of all citizens and expressed a desire to swiftly resolve lingering issues related to reconciliation. He revealed plans to make a special statement on these matters in March. During his visit to Guruthalawa Muslim Central College, the sole Muslim National School located in the Uva Province, the President received a warm welcome from the students. As part of the centenary celebrations, he inaugurated the colleges new website. The Principal, A. Sammun, presented the commemorative issue to the President, marking the centenary of the College. President Wickremesinghe took the opportunity to award medals to students who excelled in the GCE Ordinary Level and GCE Advanced Level exams. Congratulating the college on its centenary, he left a note in the commemorative book and posed for a group photo with the teaching staff. The President further commented: To secure a prosperous future for the children of our nation, it is imperative that the governments initiatives are robustly advanced. We have garnered support from nations around the world to ensure the success of these programs, which, if implemented effectively, will undoubtedly contribute to the establishment of a stable economy and the resolution of various challenges facing our country. In pursuit of these goals, I earnestly appealed to all, irrespective of political affiliations, to rally behind us in our efforts to fortify the nations economy. Regrettably, the response fell short of our expectations. There are two paramount issues that demand immediate attention in our country. Regardless of political allegiance, I once again implore all to collaborate in addressing these challenges. Firstly, the imperative is to build a stable and resilient economy. Secondly, we must seek solutions to the ethnic issues plaguing the nation. A thriving country necessitates both a robust economy and a unified community, with a confirmed Sri Lankan identity. All individuals, irrespective of their ethnicity be it Sinhalese, Tamil or Muslim, are Sri Lankans. While the Sinhalese constitute the majority, our commitment is to progress while safeguarding the Sinhala identity, religion, and culture. It is crucial to avoid any form of discrimination against other races or religions, ensuring the protection of the rights of all citizens. The path to a prosperous nation lies in collective progress as Sri Lankans. We have addressed various challenges faced by the Sinhalese people and are actively working on solutions for other issues. Additionally, the government is addressing concerns of other segments of the population. Despite the conclusion of the war, unresolved matters persist before the Human Rights Commission in Geneva and we have taken necessary steps to address these issues. Efforts are underway to rectify the displacement of some individuals by allowing settlement based on the 1985 map. Land rights are being granted to those affected in the northern and eastern provinces, comprising Tamil, Muslim, and Sinhalese communities. The government is also focusing on addressing missing persons, providing compensation and resolving outstanding issues. Furthermore, we are committed to developing the economies of the northern and eastern provinces. A robust economy is essential to prevent the recurrence of underlying issues even after their resolution. Special attention is being given to the concerns of Hill Country Tamil people, with dedicated programs focusing on their rights, including land and education development. Additionally, efforts are ongoing to address the issues faced by the Muslim community, including a thorough review of burial practices and the removal of Post  Easter Sunday attack restrictions. We are actively working on these matters, including the preparation of a draft law to regulate Madrasa schools. Expression of opinions, not related to terrorism or attempts to incite revolution, should be protected under the law and steps are being taken to ensure this. Reports are being sought from relevant ministries and officials and I expect to make a comprehensive statement by February or March. Prior to that, consultations with religious and political leaders will take place and I trust that we will receive collective support in addressing these challenges. State Minister of Higher Education Aravinda Kumar; The President noted that arrangements are underway to provide an auditorium for this school, and we extend our gratitude to him for this initiative. Throughout its 100 years of history, this school has achieved numerous milestones in education. Despite being located in a province facing considerable challenges, a substantial number of students from this institution have seized the opportunity for higher education. It is crucial to uphold this standard of quality. I extend my heartfelt best wishes for the schools future endeavors and the continued educational success of its students. Member of Parliament and Senior Advisor to the President Mr. Vadivel Suresh; We take great pride in the visit of President Ranil Wickremesinghe to Guruthalawa Muslim Central College. His dedication to educational initiatives extends beyond this locality, encompassing the entire country. Guruthalawa Muslim Central College stands as the sole Muslim national school in the area. We commend the notable talents displayed by the students of this Central College and are committed to addressing any existing deficiencies within the school. Our gratitude extends to the principal and the entire teaching staff for their efforts in imparting quality education to students, both at the GCE Ordinary level and the Advanced level. This commemorative event witnessed the presence of notable dignitaries including Muslim religious leaders, State Minister of Education Aravinda Kumar, Governor of the Uva Province A. J. M. Muzammil, Uva Provincial Director of Education Rohitha Amaradasa, other provincial education officials, teachers, parents, students and well wishes.",

        "title": "UN appoints humanitarian coordinator for war-torn Gaza",
        "date": "December 27, 2023 09:25 pm",
        "content": "Sigrid Kaag, the Netherlands former deputy prime minister and a Mideast expert, was appointed the U.N. coordinator for humanitarian aid to war-torn Gaza, the United Nations chief announced Tuesday. The announcement by U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres follows the Security Councils adoption of a resolution on Friday requesting him to expeditiously appoint a senior humanitarian and reconstruction coordinator for Gaza, where more than 2 million civilians are in desperate need of food, water and medicine, Guterres said Kaag, who speaks fluent Arabic and five other languages, brings a wealth of experience in political, humanitarian and development affairs as well as in diplomacy to her new post. She is expected to start on Jan. 8. She will facilitate, coordinate, monitor, and verify humanitarian relief consignments to Gaza, he said, adding that Kaag will also establish a U.N. mechanism to accelerate aid deliveries through states which are not party to the conflict. Gazas entire 2.3 million population is in food crisis, with 576,000 people at catastrophic or starvation levels and the risk of famine is increasing each day, according to a report released last Thursday by 23 U.N. and nongovernmental organizations. It blamed the widespread hunger on insufficient aid entering Gaza. Israel stopped all deliveries of food, water, medicine and fuel into Gaza after the militant Hamas groups Oct. 7 incursion into southern Israel that killed about 1,200 people. The Israel-Hamas war has so far killed more than 20,900 people in Gaza, two-thirds of them women and children, according to the Health Ministry in Hamas-run Gaza, which doesnt differentiate between civilians and combatants among the dead. After U.S. pressure, Israel allowed a trickle of aid in through Egypt, but U.N. agencies say that for weeks, only 10 of food needs has been entering Gaza. Last week, Israel opened the Kerem Shalom crossing into Gaza and truck traffic increased but an Israeli strike on Thursday morning on the Palestinian side of the crossing stopped aid pickups, the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, or UNRWA, said. Kaag has for years worked in the Middle East, including in the Palestinian territories. She started working for the United Nations in 1994 in Sudan and has worked for UNRWA and as regional director for the Mideast for the U.N. childrens agency UNICEF. She also served as assistant director of the U.N. Development Program, headed the U.N. mission to destroy Syrias chemical weapons, and was U.N. special envoy for Lebanon until October 2017. Kaag then became minister for trade and development in the Dutch government, and in 2018 she became the countrys first female foreign minister. Most recently, she served as deputy prime minister and the first female minister of finance from January 2022. In July, she announced she was leaving Dutch politics because of hate, intimidation and threats that put a heavy burden on my family. She told the website Euronews that after becoming finance minister and deputy prime minister she received many death threats, but the most frightening was when a man showed up at her home shouting and waving a burning torch. You dont know whats going to happen, and the safety of your family is obviously of the highest priority, Kaag, a mother of four, told Euronews in October. For me it was difficult, but bearable. It was different for my family. I always listen to them, and their opinion counts more than anything else in the world. Source: Associated Press -Agencies",

        "date": "December 28, 2023 09:22 am",
        "content": "North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has ordered its military, the munitions industry and the nuclear weapons sector to accelerate war preparations to counter what he called unprecedented confrontational moves by the U.S., state media said on Thursday. Speaking on the policy directions for the new year at a key meeting of the countrys ruling party on Wednesday, Kim also said Pyongyang would expand strategic cooperation with anti-imperialist independent countries, news agency KCNA reported. He (Kim) set forth the militant tasks for the Peoples Army and the munitions industry, nuclear weapons and civil defence sectors to further accelerate the war preparations, KCNA said. North Korea has been expanding ties with Russia, among others, as Washington accuses Pyongyang of supplying military equipment to Moscow for use in its war with Ukraine, while Russia provides technical support to help the North advance its military capabilities. Kim also laid out economic goals for the new year during the meeting, calling it a decisive year to accomplish the countrys five-year development plan, the report said. He ... clarified the important tasks for the new year to be dynamically pushed forward in the key industrial sectors, and called for stabilising the agricultural production on a high level. The North has suffered serious food shortages in recent decades, including famine in the 1990s, often as a result of natural disasters. International experts have warned that border closures during the COVID-19 pandemic worsened food security. North Koreas crop output was estimated to have increased year-on-year in 2023 due to favourable weather conditions. But a Seoul official has said the amount was still far below what is needed to address the countrys chronic food shortages. The 9th plenary meeting of the 8th central committee of the Workers Party of Korea kicked off on Tuesday to wrap up a year during which the isolated North enshrined nuclear policy in its constitution, launched a spy satellite and fired a new intercontinental ballistic missile. The days-long assembly of the party and government officials has been used in recent years to make key policy announcements. Previously, state media released Kims speech on New Years Day.

        "date": "December 28, 2023 10:22 am",
        "content": "DMDK founder-leader and popular yesteryear Tamil actor Vijayakanth died in Chennai, India on Thursday (28 Dec.), following an illness. He was 71 years old, Indian media reported. Earlier today, the party informed through a post on its official X handle that Vijayakanth was admitted to a hospital and put on ventilator support after he complained of breathing problems. His body was brought to his residence and will be taken to the DMDK office shortly. Earlier, in November, Vijayakanth was admitted to the MIOT Hospital in Chennai as his health deteriorated. Suffering from cough and throat pain, he was under the observation of doctors for 14 days. Widely known as Captain, Vijayakanths life is marked by a successful career in the Tamil film industry. He featured in 154 movies before venturing into politics. While holding a position at Nadigar Sangam (officially known as the South Indian Artistes Association (SIAA)), Vijayakanth brought revolutionary changes to the South film industry. He founded Desiya Murpokku Dravida Kazgam in 2005. In 2006, DMDK contested in all assembly seats and bagged a lowly 10 per cent of the total vote share. However, none of the partys candidates, apart from the founder-leader came out on the winning side. In 2011, DMDK fought the elections in alliance with the AIADMK and contested 41 constituencies, winning 26. The Captains party scripted history, winning more seats than the DMK in 2011 and emerged as the principal Opposition Party that year. Vijayakanth served as the leader of the Opposition in the Tamil Nadu Assembly from 2011-2016. Later, owing to differences of opinion, the DMDK broke ties with the AIADMK, resulting in bulk resignations of DMDK MLAs. The party, therefore, lost its status of being the main Opposition party. He served as a Member of the Legislative Assembly twice, representing the Virudhachalam and Rishivandiyam constituencies. The DMDK contested the 2014 parliament elections in alliance with the NDA but faced a huge defeat and its vote percentage saw a significant drop. In the 2016, 2019 and 2021 elections, the DMDK didnt perform well as Vijayakanth battled health complications. Source - ANI - Agencies",

        "date": "December 28, 2023 11:07 am",
        "content": "Russia has claimed that US sanctions levied against the Arctic LNG 2 project undermine global energy security. The Russian foreign ministrys spokeswoman hit out on Wednesday at Washingtons unacceptable move to clamp down on the massive Arctic LNG 2. The sanctions are just the latest measure implemented as the West seeks to limit Moscows financial ability to wage war in Ukraine. The remarks came after Washington announced sanctions against the new liquefied natural gas plant that is under development on the Gydan Peninsula in the Arctic last month. We consider such actions unacceptable, especially in relation to such large international commercial projects as Arctic LNG 2, which affect the energy balance of many states, said foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova. The situation around Arctic LNG 2 once again confirms the destructive role for global economic security played by Washington, which speaks of the need to maintain this security but in fact, by pursuing its own selfish interests, tries to oust competitors and destroy global energy security. Russia is the fourth-largest producer of sea-borne LNG behind the United States, Qatar and Australia. The Arctic LNG 2 project is a key element in Russias efforts to boost its share of the global market to a fifth by 2030-2035 from 8 percent now. However, the sanctions saw partners from China, Japan and France who hold a combined 40 percent of the project suspend participation last week. Project developer Novatek was also forced to declare force majeure over LNG supplies from the project, which was slated to start production in early 2024. Western countries, seeking to cripple Moscows military might, have imposed wide-ranging sanctions against Russian firms and individuals following the Kremlins decision to send tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine in February last year. However, Russia insists that Europe has been hit harder by the sanctions due to raised energy prices, while it has been successful in swiftly finding new markets in Asia. Almost all of Russias oil exports this year have been shipped to China and India, Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak said on Wednesday. Wave of drones Russia hopes that the income from Asian energy customers can continue to help drive its invasion, as it eyes Ukraines struggle to access funds and weapons from Western partners. On Wednesday, Ukrainian authorities said two people were killed after Russian forces sent a wave of attack drones against the country in an overnight raid. The Ukrainian air force said that 32 of 46 Iranian-made drones deployed by Russia had been shot down. The air force said the military had destroyed drones over parts of central, southern and western Ukraine. Most of those that got through defences struck near the front line, mainly in the southern Kherson region. Oleh Kiper, the governor of Ukraines Odesa region, said that a 35-year-old man was killed by debris from a downed drone in a residential area. Another man died in the hospital from his injuries. Four others, including a 17-year-old boy, were injured, according to Kiper. More than 10,000 civilians have been killed in Ukraine since Russias full-scale invasion, with about half of recent deaths occurring far behind the front lines, according to the UN Human Rights Office.

Speaking to the media upon his arrival at the CID premises, Dr. Bellana alleged that former Health Minister Keheliya Rambukwella, Health Ministrys Additional Secretary Saman Ratnayake and former CEO of National Medicines Regulatory Authority (NMRA) Vijith Gunasekera were were the three masterminds behind the substandard immunoglobulin controversy. He left the CID premises a short while ago after providing the statement. Thus far, several high-profile arrests have been made in connection with the case, including the former Secretary to the Health Ministry Janaka Chandragupta, the Director of the Health Ministrys Medical Supplies Division (MSD) and three other officials of the same division, as well as the owner of the company which is said to have supplied the controversial batch of substandard Immunoglobulin vials by forging documents. All six suspects are currently in remand custody until January 10 on the orders of Maligakanda Magistrates Court. Chandragupta was arrested by the CID on December 18, after he arrived at the premises to give a statement regarding the controversial substandard Human Immunoglobulin import issue. Earlier this week, the CID recorded a statement from the former Health Minister. However, his legal counsel had said that his client voluntarily provided the statement, clarifying that Rambukwella was not interrogated.",

        "date": "December 28, 2023 04:46 pm",
        "content": "Oil prices steadied on Thursday after falling sharply in the previous session, as concerns eased about shipping disruptions along the Red Sea route even as tensions in the Middle East continued to rise. Brent crude futures inched up 2 cents to 79.75 a barrel by 0736 GMT, while U.S. WTI crude futures were trading 3 cents lower at 74.08 a barrel. Prices dropped nearly 2 on Wednesday as major shipping firms began returning to the Red Sea. Concerns about shipping in the Red Sea have eased, but continued worries about tensions in the Middle East, especially on Irans involvement in the region, make it difficult to sell further, said Hiroyuki Kikukawa, president of NS Trading, a unit of Nissan Securities. The market is likely to try the upside again ... maybe in the early new year, also on expectations of a recovery in fuel demand thanks to monetary easing in the United States and higher kerosene demand during the winter in the northern hemisphere, he said. Danish shipping company Maersk said it has scheduled several dozen container vessels to travel via the Suez Canal and Red Sea in the coming weeks after calling a temporary halt to those routes this month after attacks by Yemens Iran-backed Houthi militia. But the prospect of a prolonged Israeli military campaign in Gaza and the spillover of the conflict to attacks on ships in the Red Sea remain major drivers of market sentiment. Israeli forces pummelled central Gaza by land, sea and air on Wednesday, a day after Israels chief of staff, Herzi Halevi, told reporters the war would go on for many months. U.S. government data on fuel stockpiles is due on Thursday, delayed by a day due to the Christmas holiday on Monday. Data from the American Petroleum Institute industry group on Wednesday showed crude stocks rose 1.84 million barrels in the week ended Dec. 22, against estimates from seven analysts polled by Reuters for a drop of 2.7 million barrels.

        "date": "December 28, 2023 04:54 pm",
        "content": "The economic crisis has left a profound impact on household finances, influencing both income and expenditure significantly, a survey conducted by the Department of Census and Statistics (DCS) has found. The study titled Household Survey on Impact of Economic Crisis - 2023, also found challenges have prompted households to make strategic adjustments and implement coping mechanisms to navigate these trying times. Accordingly, a majority, comprising 60.5 of households, have reported a decrease in their total income, while 5.6 experienced an increase, and 33.9 saw no change despite the crisis. During the income decline, households have employed various coping strategies, with 6.6 turning to secondary jobs or additional income sources. Notably, 73.6 did not adopt specific coping strategies. The economic crisis also led to changes in household expenditure, with 3.6 reporting a decrease, 91.1 indicating an increase, and 5.3 noting no change. The survey report mentioned that the reasons contributing to decreased monthly expenditure were diverse, with 77.0 aligning expenses with reduced income. Among those reporting increased monthly expenditure, 99.1 cited rising food expenses as a significant factor. A substantial 97.2 of households employed at least one coping strategy to manage their expenditure, showcasing the diverse approaches taken to address financial challenges. Amid one of the most challenging economic crises in Sri Lanka since gaining independence in 1948, the nations struggles began with the Easter Sunday attacks in 2019 and were compounded by the COVID-19 pandemic. The government responded with various measures to stabilize the situation. However, the economic downturn had a tangible impact on households, revealing the true extent of the crisis. Sri Lankan families faced numerous challenges in managing daily activities, including income constraints, meeting commitments, and ensuring the well-being of family members. Recognizing the importance of understanding household coping mechanisms, the Department of Census and Statistics initiated a comprehensive survey which aims to offer a detailed account of the strategies households employ to navigate economic challenges.

Investors are betting on an 87 chance of the Fed cutting rates in March, according to the CME FedWatch tool. Lower interest rates decrease the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding bullion.

Some of the new rules are aimed at punishing those who deviate from policies of President Xi Jinping, apparently to promote his political philosophy and call for loyalty to him. The revision was reported by Chinas state-run media on Wednesday. The reports say the new regulations provide tighter disciplinary safeguards to build China into a stronger and rejuvenated nation on all fronts by pursuing Chinese-style modernization. One of the new rules says those who deviate from Xis policies of new development and high-quality development could be purged from the party in the most serious punishment. Party members who have already retired from their posts can also be subject to disciplinary measures. As Xi has been concentrating political power, some foreign media outlets say frustration is growing among former party executives and their children. The amended regulations also say officials can be disciplined for failing to properly respond to petitions from the people. Beijing watchers say the Xi leadership apparently aims to tighten his grip on the party while seeking support from the public. Source - NHK - Agencies",

Chotima Iemsawasdikul, the Director General of Thai Commerce Departments Department of Trade Negotiations, has told the media on Thursday (Dec.28) that Sri Lanka hosted the 9th round of trade negotiations from December 18-20. It was attended by Auramon Supthaweethum, the Director General of Thailands Department of Business Development and advisor to FTA negotiation team. Negotiations for the free trade agreement between Sri Lanka and Thailand resumed in November after being put on hold for 4 years consequent to the Covid-19 pandemic and ongoing restructuring of Sri Lankas state-owned entities.

        "date": "December 29, 2023 12:02 pm",
        "content": "The world population grew by 75 million people over the past year and on New Years Day it will stand at more than 8 billion people, according to figures released by the U.S. Census Bureau on Thursday. The worldwide growth rate in the past year was just under 1. At the start of 2024, 4.3 births and two deaths are expected worldwide every second, according to the Census Bureau figures. The growth rate for the United States in the past year was 0.53, about half the worldwide figure. The U.S. added 1.7 million people and will have a population on New Years Day of 335.8 million people. If the current pace continues through the end of the decade, the 2020s could be the slowest-growing decade in U.S. history, yielding a growth rate of less than 4 over the 10-year-period from 2020 to 2030, said William Frey, a demographer at The Brookings Institution. The slowest-growing decade currently was in the aftermath of the Great Depression in the 1930s, when the growth rate was 7.3. Of course growth may tick up a bit as we leave the pandemic years. But it would still be difficult to get to 7.3, Frey said. At the start of 2024, the United States is expected to experience one birth every nine seconds and one death every 9.5 seconds. However, immigration will keep the population from dropping. Net international migration is expected to add one person to the U.S. population every 28.3 seconds. This combination of births, deaths and net international migration will increase the U.S. population by one person every 24.2 seconds. Source - AP News - Agencies",

        "date": "December 29, 2023 01:06 pm",
        "content": "Maines top election official has ruled that Donald Trump cannot run for president next year in the state, citing a constitutional insurrection clause. Secretary of State Shenna Bellows said Mr Trump was not eligible because of his actions leading up to the US Capitol riot in 2021. Maine now joins Colorado as the two states to ban Mr Trump from the ballot. The decisions increase pressure on the Supreme Court to weigh in. Colorado votes reliably Democratic, however, Maine is more politically competitive and would be more significant for Mr Trump - the Republican frontrunner - to lose. The 34-page ruling says that Mr Trump must be removed from the Maine ballot because of the 14th Amendment to the US Constitution - which bans anyone from holding office that has engaged in insurrection or rebellion. In her order, Mrs Bellows says that Mr Trump over the course of several months and culminating on January 6, 2021, used a false narrative of election fraud to inflame his supporters and direct them to the Capitol. She added that his occasional requests that rioters be peaceful and support law enforcement do not immunize his actions. Speaking with BBC News, Mrs Bellows said it was her duty to uphold election laws in her state, and that she hoped the Supreme Court will settle this matter nationwide. Im mindful that no secretary of state has ever deprived a presidential candidate of ballot access based on section three of the 14th Amendment. But Im also mindful that no presidential candidate has, ever before, engaged in insurrection. Mr Trumps campaign had previously called for Mrs Bellows to recuse herself from the process, and on Thursday swiftly criticised her decision. Campaign spokesman Steven Cheung called Mrs Bellows a hyper-partisan Biden-supporting Democrat and claimed she was engaging in election interference. He added that the campaign will quickly file a legal objection in state court to prevent this atrocious decision in Maine from taking effect. Mr Trumps 2024 presidential candidacy has been challenged in multiple states, on the grounds that the 14th Amendment bans him from holding office. The 14th amendment was ratified after the American Civil War in order to block Confederate secessionists from returning to power after southern states re-joined the Union. Colorados ban was the first instance of the Constitution being used to disqualify a presidential candidate. But legal experts say the Colorado ruling will have a tough time standing up when it reaches the conservative-leaning US Supreme Court. And state courts in Michigan and Minnesota have also recently dismissed efforts to block Mr Trump from the ballot. The case to remove him in the New England state was brought by a handful of former Maine lawmakers who argued that the former president had violated his oath of office. Former federal prosecutor Joe Moreno told BBC News he believed there was no way this holds up. Its breathtakingly arrogant for her to unilaterally decide that someone has committed insurrection, Moreno said about Mrs Bellows ruling. This will create a political furore thats the unfortunate outcome here, he said, adding he found Maine and Colorado to be very shaky legal decisions. It all leads to a Supreme Court showdown - which Mr Moreno said should take place rapidly to stop more states from individually determining Trumps eligibility. Thursdays ruling is the latest in a growing list of legal woes Mr Trump faces. He also has upcoming trials in federal court and in the state of Georgia for his alleged efforts to overturn his 2020 loss to Democrat Joe Biden. But he had not been charged with inciting insurrection in either case. Source: BBC -Agencies",

        "date": "December 29, 2023 03:55 pm",
        "content": "Sri Lankas overall rate of inflation measured by Colombo Consumer Price Index (CCPI) on year-on-year basis has increased to 4.0 in December from 3.4 in November. Meanwhile, food inflation increased to 0.3 in December 2023 from -3.6 in November 2023, the Census  Statistics Department (DCS) said in its latest release. Meanwhile, the year-on-year inflation of the non-food group dropped to 5.8 in December from 6.8 in November. For the month of December, the contribution to inflation by food commodities was 0.10, while the contribution of non-food items was 3.90. The DCS said this was mainly due to the increases in value change in groups of housing, water, electricity, gas  other fuels, education, clothing  footwear, alcoholic beverages, tobacco  narcotic, recreation  culture, health and miscellaneous goods  services. A decrease in value change was reported for the groups of transport, furnishing household equipment and routine household maintenance, restaurants and hotels and health. Further, a very slight price increase was reported in group communication during the month. The CCPI is an economic indicator constructed to measure inflation which is defined in percentage change in the CCPI over the year. There are two measures of inflation in general use. One measure is the year-on-year base or point-to-point inflation (the percentage change in the CPI during the last 12 months). The other measure is moving average inflation (the percentage difference between the average price index of the last 12 months and the average price index of previous 12 months).

        "content": "Governor of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) Dr. Nandala Weerasinghe has emphasised the importance of the continuity of the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Speaking at a special briefing held this afternoon (29 Dec.), Dr. Weerasinghe explained that the EFF programme should continue for the next four years, under any government, in order to get the debt relief and international financial support required. He warned that unilateral withdrawal from the IMF-EFF agreement will result in severe implications. Dr. Weerasinghe was addressing a press briefing convened at the Central Bank premises on the Financial Stability Review (FSR) of 2023. The CBSL recently released its report on FSR for 2023 which highlighted that although it is expected that the existing macro-financial vulnerabilities would dissipate in the period ahead, with the envisaged improvements in the macroeconomic front, continued advancement along the policy reforms agenda envisaged in the IMF-EFF agreement is essential to direct the economy and the financial system into stable grounds. In this vein, the report read: Any deviation from this path would bring detrimental and irreversible consequences to the financial system and the economy, though moving along this arduous and narrow path is challenging. The instigation and operationalisation of strong and appropriate frameworks that proactively address vulnerabilities and implementation of timely, well sequenced, and consistent policies is also crucial to ensure the stability of the Sri Lankan financial system. As the economy undergoes a monetary policy easing cycle, the credit cycle is expected to enter an expansionary phase, in which macroprudential concerns could build-up. The Central Bank commits to monitoring these developments closely and implementing necessary policy actions to mitigate systemic risks and ensure financial stability through macroprudential interventions",

        "date": "December 29, 2023 08:17 pm",
        "content": "Russia has launched the biggest air attack on Ukraine since the beginning of the full-scale invasion, the Ukrainian military told CNN, with an unprecedented number of drones and missiles fired at targets across the country, killing at least 26 people and injuring more than 120 others. The wave of attacks began overnight into Friday and struck nationwide, with blasts reported in the capital Kyiv, as well as at a maternity hospital in the central city of Dnipro, the eastern city of Kharkiv, the southeastern port of Odesa, and the western city of Lviv, far from the frontlines. The strikes continued Friday afternoon, Ukraines air force said, as a barrage of missiles targeted the northern Cherkasy region, with one hitting the city of Smilla. Other missiles were detected from Russias Kursk region heading towards the northeastern Ukrainian city of Sumy. Its been a long time since we have seen so many enemy targets on our monitors in all regions and all directions, Yurii Ihnat, spokesperson for Ukraines air force, told national television. Everything was being fired. Russia used 158 drones and missiles, including hypersonic Kinzhal missiles, cruise missiles and Shahed drones, to strike targets in Kyiv, the east, south and west of the country, Ukraines air force said. Today the enemy has struck a powerful blow. There are downed targets, however unfortunately there are also casualties, Ihnat added. The Polish military reported an unidentified airborne object entered Polish airspace from Ukrainian territory early Friday morning. Ihnat implied the object may have been fired by Ukrainian air defenses seeking to intercept incoming Russian missiles near the far-western city of Lviv, near Polands border. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Russia used nearly every type of weapon in its arsenal in the terrorist strikes, to which he pledged Ukraines military would respond. The massive overnight assault comes just days after Ukraine struck a Russian Navy landing ship in Crimea on Tuesday, causing severe damage to the vessel in another major blow to Moscows Black Sea fleet. But the onslaught also came shortly after Ukraine received the last package of military aid from the United States until Congress approves the Biden administrations funding request. Nearly two years since Russian President Vladimir Putin launched his unprovoked invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Zelensky is facing a largely-stalled counteroffensive while Western aid has begun to dry up. In Kyiv at least three people were killed and 28 injured, including 25 hospitalized, after Russia targeted a metro station and residential buildings. Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said four people had been pulled from the rubble of a damaged warehouse in Shevchenkivskyi district, adding that rescue operations were ongoing. Kharkiv was hit by a massive attack, Ukrainian Prime Minster Denys Shmyhal said, with more than 20 strikes reported in the region, including on a hospital. At least three people were killed and 11 injured in the strikes, according to regional military administration head Oleh Syniehubov. At least four people were killed and 10 people were injured in the southern region of Zaporizhzhia, the regional military administration head Yurif Malashko said on Telegram. Emergency workers are still working to see if people are trapped under the rubble of collapsed buildings. Malashko said the region had been targeted by 10 missiles, including Kinzhal missiles, of which one was intercepted. Further south, a school building was hit in Odesa, injuring seven people, including a child. At least three people were killed and 22 injured  including two children and a pregnant woman  in strikes elsewhere in the region, according to Oleh Kiper, head of Odesa region military administration. At least 18 people were hospitalized. And in the central city of Dnipro, at least five were killed and more than 20 injured, officials said. Prime Minister Shymal praised the professionalism of Ukraines air defense forces, which he said had shot down most of the drones and missiles, but had not been able to prevent all of the strikes. Ukraines Foreign Ministry said Russia had targeted Ukrainian women, children, the elderly, and civilians. The crimes that Russia has committed in Ukraine today are its revenge for its inability to turn the tide of the battle in the fight against the Ukrainian defense forces, it said in a statement. Without referring directly to Fridays attacks, the Russian Defense Ministry said its army had carried out 50 group strikes and one mass strike with high-precision weapons and unmanned aerial vehicles in the period from December 23 to 29, claiming it had only struck military targets. The head of Ukraines Presidential Office, Andriy Yermak, called for support as his country battles Russian airstrikes. A massive terrorist attack, rockets are flying at our cities again, and civilians are being targeted, Yermak said in a Telegram post on Friday. Ukraine needs support. We will be even stronger, we are doing everything to strengthen our air shield. But the world needs to see that we need more support and strength to stop this terror. The house was shaking The Ukrainian Air Force said it recorded the departure of 9 Tu-95MS strategic bombers from the Olenya airfield in the Murmansk region of Russia. The Tu-95 bomber is a mainstay of Russias aerial attacks on Ukraine, able to launch cruise missiles against its neighbor out of the range of most air-defense systems. In Kyiv, air raid sirens sounded for several hours overnight. Residents told CNN later Friday how they were woken by the attacks. It was very loud, the house was shaking, it was very scary, said Viktoria Krasyuk. It seems like youve been living in this for many months, but it still causes emotions, its still very difficult, its very hard to decide whether to stay or go somewhere, or even leave (the country). A man named Sehiy told CNN the attack was a reminder that Russias goal is the same  to destroy Ukraine as a state. Unfortunately, Russia is learning to fight. It is learning to fight, including from us Ukrainians. They are accumulating ammunition, everything else they need, he said. Trains were halted as a building was damaged at Lukianivska subway station in central Kyiv, which is also operating as a shelter, mayor Klitschko said. Many were wounded and a search for victims is underway after a warehouse caught fire in the Podilskyi district of the capital region, the head of Kyivs military administration, Serhiy Popko, said in a Telegram post. In Lviv, which borders Poland, the head of the regional military administration said that at least 15 people had been injured, with damage reported in 13 residential buildings and two schools. The National Basketball Federation later announced that one of the countrys most celebrated basketball players, Viktor Kobzystyi, had died in the strikes on the city. Responding to reports that an unidentified airborne object had entered Polish airspace, Ihnat, spokesperson for Ukraines airforce, said this is not something new. Weve seen missiles flying into Romania, as well as attack UAVs and debris. The same thing happened in Poland, he told Ukrainian television. These things can happen under such massive attacks. The enemy is attacking the border areas in the west of Ukraine as well. In November 2022, a missile struck near the Polish village Przewodow, close to the border with Ukraine, killing two people. US officials later determined it was a Ukrainian S-300 air defense missile. Fridays widespread strikes followed Russias launch of 53 attacks across eastern Ukraine on Thursday, according to a Telegram post from the Ukrainian General Staff. Russia launched dozens of airstrikes, wounding civilians and destroying civilian infrastructure, the post said. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said he wished the loud sound of explosions heard across Ukraine Friday morning could be heard all around the world. In all major capitals, headquarters, and parliaments, which are currently debating further support for Ukraine. In all newsrooms, which are writing about fatigue or Russia purportedly being ready for negotiations, he wrote on X. These sounds are what Russia really has to say. Our only collective response can and must be continued, robust, and long-term military and financial assistance to Ukraine. Only greater firepower can silence Russian terror.

        "date": "December 30, 2023 09:06 am",
        "content": "South Africa asked the International Court of Justice (ICJ) on Friday for an urgent order declaring that Israel was in breach of its obligations under the 1948 Genocide Convention in its crackdown against the Palestinian group Hamas in Gaza. The ICJ, sometimes known as the World Court, is the United Nations venue for resolving disputes between states. Israels foreign ministry said in a reaction that the suit was baseless. South Africas filing alleged Israel was violating its obligations under the treaty, drafted in the wake of the Holocaust, which makes it a crime to attempt to destroy a people in whole or in part. It asked the court to issue provisional, or short-term, measures ordering Israel to stop its military campaign in Gaza, which it said were necessary in this case to protect against further, severe and irreparable harm to the rights of the Palestinian people. No date has been set for a hearing. While the ICJ in The Hague is considered the U.N.s highest court, its rulings are sometimes ignored. In March 2022 the court ordered Russia to immediately halt its military campaign in Ukraine. ISRAEL REJECTS FILING War began on Oct. 7 when militants of the Islamist group Hamas killed 1,200 people in a cross-border attack on Israel and seized 240 hostages by Israels count. Israel responded with an assault on Hamas-ruled Gaza, killing more than 21,000 people, Palestinian health officials say. In a first response to South Africas suit, Israels foreign ministry blamed Hamas for the suffering of Palestinians in the Gaza Strip by using them as human shields and stealing humanitarian aid from them, accusations Hamas denies. Israel has made it clear that the residents of the Gaza Strip are not the enemy, and is making every effort to limit harm to the non-involved, the ministry statement said. Palestine, whose statehood is contested but is seen by the court as having observer state status, said it welcomed South Africas suit. The court must immediately take action to protect the Palestinian people and call on Israel, the occupying power, to halt its onslaught, the Palestinian Foreign Ministry said in a statement. The court application is the latest move by South Africa, a critic of Israels war, to ratchet up pressure after its lawmakers last month voted in favour of closing down the Israeli embassy in Pretoria and suspending diplomatic relations. In a statement from South Africas Department of International Relations and Cooperation (DIRCO), the government said the application against Israel was filed on Friday. Israel, since 7 October 2023 in particular, has failed to prevent genocide and has failed to prosecute the direct and public incitement to genocide, DIRCO said in a statement. South Africa has backed the Palestinian cause for statehood in Israeli-occupied territories for decades, likening the plight of Palestinians to those of the Black majority in South Africa during the repressive apartheid era, a comparison that Israel vehemently denies. A different court in The Hague, the International Criminal Court (ICC), is separately investigating alleged atrocities in Gaza and the West Bank, but has not named any suspects. Israel is not a member of the ICC and rejects its jurisdiction. Source: Reuters -Agencies",

        "content": "Saudi Arabia has ranked first in providing work opportunities to Sri Lankan expats in 2023, as more than 63,000 of them found employment in the Kingdom. Every year, more than 200,000 migrant workers leave Sri Lanka to work abroad. They are a main source of foreign exchange for the country, which since last year was gripped by its worst ever financial crisis. P.M. Amza, Sri Lankas ambassador to Saudi Arabia, estimated that in 2023 remittances amounted to over 7 billion, of which a significant portion was contributed by expat workers in the Kingdom. During the year 2023, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has become the number one country, generating 63,000 employment (opportunities) for Sri Lankans, he told Arab News on Saturday. Of the annual remittances amounting to 7-8 billion a year, a sizable portion has been generated from the Kingdom, which is in the region of 15 to 20 percent of the total remittances. Gulf Cooperation Council countries are a preferred choice for Sri Lankan workers, with Saudi Arabia being their key destination, lately also attracting skilled professionals to its megaprojects under Vision 2030. These projects, in addition to a new employment scheme under the Skill Verification Program, were the main factors making the Kingdom increasingly attractive to Sri Lankans, according to Amza. The SVP agreement signed in March aims to improve the professional competence of employees in the Saudi labor market and ease the recruitment process of skilled workers from the island nation. Under the deal  which covers 23 professions  Saudi employers recognize accreditations issued by Sri Lankas Tertiary and Vocational Education Commission. The year 2023 has seen the qualitative and quantitative increase of employment opportunities for Sri Lankans in the Kingdom, Amza said, adding that while half of Sri Lankan expats have been employed in the domestic sector, this year showed growth in the number of those working in the construction and hospitality sector. The signing of the agreement on the Skill Verification Program between the two countries has also contributed to this increase of skill and professional categories of employment, which stood as nearly 12,000 during 2023.

        "content": "The members of BLACKPINK are closing out the year with some bombshell news  Jennie, Jisoo, Rosé and Lisa have split with YG Entertainment for all solo endeavors. On Friday (Dec. 29), YG issued a statement announcing the decision. YG recently signed an extension contract for BLACKPINKs group activities and agreed not to proceed with a separate additional contract for individual activities, read a translated statement provided to Billboard by representatives for YG Entertainment. We will do our best to support BLACKPINKs activities and will cheer for the individual activities of the members with a warm heart. Earlier this month (Dec. 6), via a regulatory filing, YG Entertainment confirmed that BLACKPINK had renewed its contract with the company for all group activities. Details regarding the new contracts were not immediately available upon filing. Just this week (Dec. 24), Jennie shared that she will be launching a new record label and company called OA. A caption of a photoset posted to the official OA Instagram page reads: OA, which stands for ODD ATELIER, is a space that aims to create new things that attract attention in a different way from what is usual or expected. It is a label founded by artist JENNIE in November 2023. To date, all four members of BLACKPINK have begun their respective solo journeys. In 2021, both Rosé and Lisa unleashed their debut solo albums. Rosés -R- contained the single On the Ground, which debuted at No. 1 on both the Billboard Global 200 and Global Excl. US charts  the first song by a Korean solo artist to do so. With her LaLisa album  which housed a pair of Billboard Hot 100 hits in the title track (No. 84) and Money (No. 90)  Lisa became the first soloist to win the MTV Video Music Award for best K-pop. This spring (Mar. 31), Jisoo released Me, her debut single album. The two-track project was led by Flower, which reached No. 2 on the Global 200. Although Jennie was the first BLACKPINK member to go solo back in 2018 (her aptly titled Solo peaked atop US World Digital Song Sales), she finally made her Hot 100 debut on the chart dated Dec. 30, 2023, with her Idol hit One of the Girls alongside The Weeknd  Lily-Rose Depp. In June, Jennie starred in the controversial Weeknd-produced HBO drama The Idol. BLACKPINK is, to date, the most successful K-pop girl group in U.S. history. In 2023, the group headlined Coachella and wrapped their blockbuster Born Pink World Tour (which helped them take home top K-pop touring artist at the 2023 Billboard Music Awards) in support of their Billboard 200-topping Born Pink album.

It is expected that pardoning of the Sri Lankan detainees would contribute to further strengthening these friendly relations, the Sri Lankan Embassy in Abu Dhabi said in a statement. These 44 Sri Lankans who have received the Royal pardon will be repatriated to Sri Lanka by the government of the UAE in due course. The Sri Lankan Embassy in Abu Dhabi will collaboratively coordinate with the UAE government authorities and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Sri Lanka to ensure their safe repatriation.

        "date": "December 30, 2023 10:35 pm",
        "content": "A pioneer of location-tracking technology has been appointed OBE in the Kings New Year Honours in the United Kingdom. Dr Sabesan Sithamparanathan, who founded Cambridge company PervasID, devised a real-time location tracking system used by NHS trusts, hospitals, aircraft manufacturers and retailers. He is among 105 people in the East honoured for their exceptional contribution to their communities. He said he was absolutely over the moon, thrilled to receive the award. Dr Sithamparanathan is recognised for services to innovation technology and the promotion of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (Stem) subjects in education. He said it was a great honour and testament to the hard work and innovation of the entire team. In hospitals, his system uses electromagnetic fields to track surgical instruments, ensuring they are decontaminated and sterilised properly, and available in the right place at the right time. Retailers have also adopted the technology to track stock and enhance click-and-collect services. Originally from Sri Lanka, Dr Sithamparanathan studied at the University of Sheffield before embarking on a PhD at Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, where he developed his tracking system. He was elected a research fellow at Girton College in 2011. I came here as a teenager to pursue higher education, he said. If it was not for Cambridge and the people who mentored me along the way, I would not be where I am today. Cambridge allowed me to exploit possibilities; to maximise potential. I learned from very talented professionals. At the end of the day, innovating is exciting but bringing an idea from the lab to the real world has been a real challenge. On a personal level, it is a dream come true. Other people from Cambridgeshire who have received awards in the Kings New Year Honours List include:  Lorna Woor, 69, from Cambridge, the founder of a village stitches group, receives the BEM for services to the community  Sheila Betts, 72, from Cambridge, the chair and volunteer with the Jarman Centre for Girlguiding, receives the BEM for services to young people  Sharon Livermore, 42, from Ely, is appointed MBE for services to the victims of domestic abuse  Helen Pain, 54, from Great Chishill, is appointed MBE for services to science  Maxine Purdie, 54, from Ely, is appointed MBE for services to knowledge exchange  Julia Fentem, 57, from Huntingdon, is appointed MBE for services to human health and animal welfare  Joan Winterkorn, 74, from Cambridge, is appointed MBE for services to heritage and culture  Michael Frankl, 75, from Cambridge, is appointed MBE for services to charity, to homeless people and to the Jewish community in Cambridge Source: BBC -Agencies",

        "content": "In what could be seen as a bid to woo Tamil voters ahead of the 2024 LS elections, BJP national president JP Nadda on Saturday released a stamp commemorating 200 years of Indian-origin Tamils living in Sri Lanka now. Nadda, speaking at the BJP central office-based function, said, This is truly a historic occasion when we remember the extreme hardships endured by the people belonging to the Madras Presidency who were taken to erstwhile Ceylon by the British and their long struggle to gain dignity and recognition. Nadda, reiterating the Modi governments commitment, further said that the government as well as the BJP is deeply committed to the welfare and prosperity of Indian-origin Tamils in Sri Lanka. We have been working relentlessly to provide them with housing, healthcare, and other basic necessities, ensuring their ease of living, he said, adding that Narendra Modi visited Jaffna in Sri Lanka after becoming Prime Minister in 2014 and promised pucca houses for Indian-origin Tamils. Thats when our people got the opportunity to live a life with dignity in Sri Lanka, he said, adding that the PM during his visit to Jaffna in 2017 promised 14,000 pucca houses for India-origin Tamils in Sri Lanka and fulfilled it to a great extent. Quoting various references, Nadda said that the Britishers made them (Tamils in Sri Lanka now) migrate to Sri Lanka after they started economic activities there and wanted them to work in many fields. Nadda assured that the BJP-led government under the leadership of PM Narendra Modi is truly concerned with the welfare of Tamils in Sri Lanka and acknowledges their contributions made in infrastructural development in Sri Lanka. Present at the function, Senthil Thondaman, governor of Eastern Province (Sri Lanka), as a special guest, also lauded PMs concerns shown for Tamils in Sri Lanka I thank PM Modi for his support in rebuilding Sri Lanka during an economic crisis and taking care of Indian-origin Tamils.

        "date": "December 31, 2023 02:06 pm",
        "content": "An election boycotted by the main opposition as the worlds longest serving female prime minister looks set to extend her rule. A cricket legend and former prime minister languishing in prison versus a one-time fugitive looking to make a comeback as a powerful military keeps watch. A populist leader hoping to enter his second decade in power as he pushes a popular but religiously divisive brand of politics. And an island nation recovering from its worst economic crisis in decades after protesters stormed the presidential palace. Four South Asian countries are expected to head to the polls next year, in a grand test for democracy that will see nearly 2 billion people across Bangladesh, Pakistan, India and Sri Lanka cast their ballots from January through September. All former colonies who gained independence from Britain within the last century, each are at a different stage of growth and facing a variety of crises and opportunities. Heres what you need to know about democracys greatest show. Bangladesh Bangladesh, a country of some 170 million people, is the first to cast votes on January 7. The once multiparty democracy is being threatened as its ruling Awami League party continues what rights groups say is a campaign to silence dissent, pushing the republic toward something more closely resembling a one-party state. Sheikh Hasina, current Prime Minister and chair of the Awami Party, is likely to be reelected as the countrys leader for a fourth consecutive term. Hasina has been in power since 2009 and won the last election in December 2019, in a poll marred in deadly violence and accusations of poll rigging. Missing then was her primary opponent Khaleda Zia, a former prime minister and chief of the main opposition, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), who was jailed the year before on corruption charges. For much of the past three decades, politics in Bangladesh has been defined by a bitter rivalry between the two women, who both saw their politician father and husband respectively assassinated in office. Political turmoil has followed into the second generation. Zia, 78, now lives under house arrest and her BNP continues to face mounting challenges by Hasina and her ruling dispensation with the mass arrest of its politicians. The situation has led to protests, and the BNP has decided to boycott the election again, paving the way for Hasina once more. The government is claiming to commit to free and fair elections with diplomatic partners while the state authorities are simultaneously filling prisons with the ruling Awami Leagues political opponents, said Julia Bleckner, senior Asia researcher at Human Rights Watch, in a November statement. A free election is impossible when the government stifles free expression and systematically incapacitates the opposition, critics, and activists through arbitrary arrests, enforced disappearance, harassment, and intimidation, Bleckner added. Yet, the country  which is aspiring to become a middle-income country by 2031  is experiencing an era of economic growth. Much of this is because of the garment manufacturing industry, which accounts for 35.1 of Bangladeshs annual gross domestic product, according to the US Commerce Department. Since its come into being, Bangladesh has always had political instability, but theyve managed to have very good growth rate said Sreeradha Dutta, professor of international affairs at OP Jindal Global University and author of Bangladesh on a New Journey  Moving Beyond Regional Identity. She added also that the country is building strong relations with key neighbors in the region. So irrespective whoever the leader is, the same developmental models will be picked up because Bangladesh aspires to be something much larger than what it currently is. Pakistan Ruled for much of its 76 years by political dynasties or military establishments, no democratically elected leader has ever completed a full five-year term since Pakistan won independence. In recent years the country of 230 million has seen the all-too-familiar mix of political instability and militant attacks percolate alongside a particularly acute economic crisis that has been brutal on both middle and lower income families. Imran Khan, the countrys former prime minister and arguably the most popular figurehead, is languishing behind bars, charged with fraud and facing charges for revealing state secrets  leaving him unable to contest in the upcoming polls in February. Khan, who was ousted from power in a parliamentary no-confidence vote last year, says the charges against him are politically motivated and framed to stop him from standing in the election, an allegation authorities deny. TV stations are banned from running Khans speeches, and many of his Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party colleagues have been arrested. In October, Nawaz Sharif, the fugitive former prime minister of Pakistan, returned to the South Asian nation after nearly four years in self-exile, skirting arrest and stirring up the countrys already fraught political scene and leaving many to believe he is bidding for the top seat once again. The country, meanwhile, faces mounting challenges  from economic uncertainty and frequent militant attacks to climate catastrophes that are putting millions at risk  setting the stage for a difficult road to recovery for its new leadership. Political and economic uncertainty go hand in hand, said Fahd Humayun, assistant professor of political science  Neubauer faculty fellow at the department of political science at Tufts University. And any government coming to power through suspicious elections is not only likely to be on a weak footing and reliant on the military for its political survival but will also be unlikely to attract the capital inflows so badly needed. India Often called the worlds largest experiment in democracy, India is expected to head to the polls in the spring, in a mammoth election that is likely to see Prime Minister Narendra Modi secure a rare third term in power. The populist leader of the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), has tightened his grip on Indias democratic institutions in way not seen since 1970s, when Indira Gandhi ruled the country with an iron fist, pushing it toward autocracy. But on the world stage, India has arguably never been more significant. Modi, whose calendar this year included diplomatic trips to Australia and the United States, is presenting himself as a statesman who is cementing the country as a modern superpower. And 2023 has been a remarkable year for Indias 1.4 billion people. This year was the moment it overtook China to become the worlds most-populous nation, while the year before it surpassed its former colonial ruler Britain to become the worlds fifth-largest economy. In August, India made history by soft landing a rover on the moon, becoming just the fourth nation in the world to have completed such a feat  and it launched its first spacecraft dedicated to studying the sun weeks after. The country hosted the Group of 20 (G20) in September, presenting New Delhi with an opportunity to extend its leadership beyond the countrys borders at a time of increasing political turmoil. Yet, since his first election nearly a decade ago, critics also say the once secular and democratic founding ethos of the worlds largest democracy is crumbling at alarming speed, with minorities feeling persecuted under the BJPs majoritarian policies and any criticism of the government facing censorship and harsh punishment. Squaring off against Modi is a newly formed alliance of 26 political parties known as INDIA, which includes the countrys main opposition, the Indian National Congress. But in its most recent gauge of voter sentiment, the Congress party lost three out of four regional votes in key state elections in December, giving a boost to Modi and his BJP. As the election draws close, analysts say Indian politics remains unpredictable, and much can change as the parties gear up to campaign in the months ahead. People are hoping there will be a challenge to Modi, that the opposition parties can get their act together. That dream that seemed possible even three months ago now looks more difficult, said C. Raja Mohan, senior fellow at Asia Society Policy Institute, during a recent talk with the Asia Society. But even six months is a long time in politics. Sri Lanka Nearly two years ago, Sri Lankas then-President Gotabaya Rajapaksa was forced to flee his country after angry protesters stormed his residence in anger, blaming him for the countrys worst economic crisis in 73 years. It was a remarkable moment for a protest movement that thrust the bankrupt nation of 22 million into the global spotlight after inflation soared and foreign reserves dwindled, leaving millions unable to afford food, fuel and medicines. Rajapaksa resigned from his post, paving the way for current President Ranil Wickremesinghe to take over. In elections expected before September, Wickremesinghe is likely to stand for a second term, months after he helped secure a much-needed loan from the International Monetary Fund and made sweeping reforms to the budget to ensure financial growth. Sri Lanka hasnt had a general election since 2018, and Wickremesinghe has repeatedly delayed the polls due to the economic crisis. As the economy  and the countrys people  recover, a date for the election is yet to be announced and it remains to be seen whether 2024 will be the year the countrys people decide on its future leader.

        "date": "December 31, 2023 03:29 pm",
        "content": "Two-time Oscar-nominated actor Tom Wilkinson, who starred in The Full Monty, a film about a group of unemployed steel workers who launch new careers as strippers, died on Saturday aged 75. The British actors death was confirmed in a statement released by his agent on behalf of his family. It is with great sadness that the family of Tom Wilkinson announce that he died suddenly at home on December 30. His wife and family were with him. Among his numerous accolades was an Academy Award nomination for In the Bedroom in 2001, and another for a supporting role in Michael Clayton in 2007. He most recently reunited with his Full Monty co-stars Robert Carlyle and Mark Addy in a Disney series of the same name. The original 1997 smash hit about an unlikely group of men stripping won an Oscar for Best Original MusicalComedy or comedy score and was nominated in three other categories, including Best Picture and best director. Wilkinson played Gerald Cooper, an ex-foreman who was recruited to help the unemployed men dance. The actor also took home a Best Supporting Actor Bafta for the role. Carlyle paid tribute to his co-star, calling him a real titan of an actor, one of the greats of not only his but of any generation. Wilkinson, who was born in Leeds to a family of farmers, studied at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in London and racked up more than 130 film and TV credits, including Batman Begins, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind and Shakespeare in Love. While working on the British mini-series First Among Equals in 1986, he met actress Diana Hardcastle, who he married in 1988. The couple had two daughters. American actor George Clooney, who played alongside Wilkinson in Michael Clayton, told Variety: Tom made every project better. Made every actor better. He was the epitome of elegance and he will be dearly missed by all of us. Peaky Blinders actor Aneurin Barnard, who starred opposite Wilkinson in the 2018 black comedy Dead in a Week (Or Your Money Back), said he was sad to hear of his co-stars passing. One of our wonderful legends that we say goodbye to. Bye for now Tom x, he wrote on social media. Wilkinson won a 2009 Golden Globe and 2008 Emmy for his role as American political figure Benjamin Franklin in the HBO series John Adams, playing opposite Paul Giamatti. A noted character actor, he also netted roles in a BBC adaptation of Charles Dickenss novel Martin Chuzzlewit; the 1995 adaptation of Jane Austens Sense and Sensibility; the 2014 Wes Anderson comedy-drama The Grand Budapest Hotel; and 2011 ensemble comedy The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel. In 2005, Wilkinson was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) for services to drama. Source - AFP --Agencies",

        "date": "December 31, 2023 04:20 pm",
        "content": "After Reddit user boddhya posted two pictures of a Cybertruck accident, the California Highway Patrol confirmed to The Verge that units responded to a two-vehicle accident on SR 35 (Skyline Boulevard). It occurred in this area south of Page Mill Road, which Google Maps lists as Palo Alto, around 2:05PM local time and involved a 2023 Tesla Cybertruck carrying three people that appears to have been hit by a 2009 Toyota Corolla driven by a 17-year-old. Teslas Cybertruck delivery event raised questions about the design and what would occur in an impact with other cars or pedestrians. Fortunately, it doesnt appear that anyone involved in this incident suffered major injury as a result. Our preliminary investigation indicates a Toyota Corolla was traveling south on SR-35 southbound, south of Page Mill Road, at an unknown speed, when the driver, for unknown reasons, turned to the right and subsequently struck a dirt embankment on the right shoulder. The Toyota then re-entered the roadway, crossed over the double yellow lines into the northbound lane, and crashed into a Tesla Cybertruck traveling north on SR-35 northbound. The only injury noted in the release provided by CHP mentions a suspected minor injury to the Cybertruck driver, who declined medical transportation, and it mentions that it does not appear the Tesla was operating in autonomous mode. The weather is described as cloudy and wet. The pictures posted on Reddit show significant damage to the Corollas front end. You can also get a look at the drivers side and front of the Corolla as a driver approaches the accident in dashcam footage posted to YouTube. Although we still cant see the front of the Cybertruck, both sides of the vehicle and the rear dont show the same amount of damage despite the side-curtain airbags deployed. While the truck doesnt show markings of a release candidate, we didnt spot any of the Foundation Series etching, so its unclear if this is a customer-delivered model or something else.

        "date": "December 31, 2023 04:58 pm",
        "content": "The US Navy has destroyed Houthi small boats attempting to board a container ship in the Red Sea. Four vessels from Houthi-controlled areas in Yemen fired upon the Maersk Hangzhou and got to within metres of the ship, the US military said. Helicopters from nearby US warships responded to a distress call and after being fired upon, sunk three of them in self-defence. The crews were killed and the fourth boat fled the area. The Houthis have been attacking ships in the Red Sea since November. The Iranian-backed Yemeni rebel group have claimed its attacks on the vital shipping lane are directed at vessels linked to Israel, in response to the war in Gaza. The commercial ship attacked, the Maersk Hangzhou, is registered to Singapore and operated and owned by a Danish firm, US Central Command (Centcom) said. Maersk, one of the largest shipping companies in the world, says it has paused sailings through the Red Sea for 48 hours. The four Houthi boats attacked at around 06:30 Yemeni time (03:30 GMT) with mounted weapons and small arms, getting to within 20m (66ft) of the container ship, which the crew attempted to board. The ships crew issued a distress call and a security team returned fire, the statement said. Helicopters from the nearby USS Eisenhower aircraft carrier and USS Gravely destroyer responded to the call for help and were shot at while in the process of issuing verbal calls to the small boats. The helicopters returned fire in self-defense, sinking three of the four small boats, and killing the crews, Centcom said. It added that the fourth boat fled the area and no damage had been recorded to US personnel or equipment. It was the second attack on the Maersk Hangzhou in 24 hours, after it was attacked with missiles on Saturday. The anti-ship missiles were fired from Houthi-controlled areas as the destroyers Gravely and Laboon responded on Saturday, according to a previous Centcom statement. A US Navy admiral told AP the missile attack was the first successful strike since a global patrol was launched on 18 December. Centcom said while the ships were responding to the distress call, two anti-ship missiles were fired from Houthi-controlled areas at the pair of US navy vessels. The USS Gravely destroyed the inbound ballistic missiles, Centcom said, adding it was the twenty-third illegal attack by the Houthis on international shipping since 19 November. Centcom added the Maersk Hangzhou is reportedly seaworthy and there are no reported injuries on board. Separately, the United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations (UKMTO) organisation reported an incident in the Red Sea about 55 nautical miles (101km) to the south-west of the Yemeni port of Hodeidah. In a statement, the organisation said an unidentified ship had reported a loud bang accompanied by a flash on the port bow of the vessel and several explosions. No damage was recorded and all members of the crew were reported unhurt, with the vessel escaping the area to a nearby port, the statement said. The rise in Houthi attacks over several weeks has led many shipping firms, including Maersk, to divert their vessels away from the Red Sea, travelling around the horn of Africa instead. To reach the Suez Canal in Egypt - which connects to the Mediterranean Sea - ships must pass through the tiny Bab al-Mandab Strait, just off the coast of Houthi-controlled areas in Yemen. The Tehran-sponsored rebels have previously claimed to only target Israel-linked commercial ships in response to the war in Gaza, saying the attacks are an attempt to stop Israeli attacks on Palestinians. In response, the US launched Operation Prosperity Guardian - an international coalition to safeguard shipping in the the region. In an interview with the Associated Press, US Navy Vice Admiral Brad Cooper said the Houthis do not seem to be ending their reckless attacks in light of the maritime taskforce. He added that 1,200 commercial ships have passed through the Red Sea since the operation was launched, with none hit by drone or missile strikes until Saturday. Maersk said last week that it was preparing to resume journeys through Red Sea - after diverting to the much longer route around the Cape of Good Hope because of recent Houthi attacks on shipping. Sundays attacks have led to another 48 hour pause. The Red Sea is one of the worlds most important shipping lanes as it links markets in Europe with Asia. Analysts have warned the attacks could see a rise in prices, as it is also one of the most important routes for oil and liquefied natural gas shipments produced in the Middle East.

        "date": "December 31, 2023 06:10 pm",
        "content": "Auckland has become the first major city to ring in 2024, with thousands cheering a fireworks display sprouting from New Zealands tallest structure, Sky Tower, and a downtown light show. This years New Years Eve celebrations are overshadowed by the ongoing wars in Ukraine and Gaza, which have cast a pall over festivities and heightened tensions across parts of the world. Many cities are deploying extra security and some places have canceled New Years Eve events altogether. In Auckland, light rain throughout Sunday had cleared as forecast by midnight over the city of 1.7 million people before the countdown began on an illuminated digital display near the top of the 328-meter (1,076-foot) communications and observation tower. Two hours later in neighboring Australia, the Sydney Harbor Bridge will become the focal point of a renowned midnight fireworks display and light show viewed annually by around 425 million people worldwide, according to city authorities. More police than ever have been deployed throughout Sydney to ensure safety as more than 1 million people  equivalent to one in five of the citys population  converge on the harbor waterfront for the best available views, state government authorities said in a statement. Many revelers have been camping at the best vantage points since Sunday morning. The waterfront has been the scene of heated pro-Palestinian protests after the sails of the Sydney Opera House were illuminated in the colors of the Israeli flag in response to the Oct. 7 attack by Palestinian militant group Hamas that triggered the war. In the Vatican, Pope Francis recalled 2023 as a year marked by war during a traditional Sunday blessing from a window overlooking St. Peters Square. He offered prayers for the tormented Ukrainian people and the Palestinian and Israeli populations, the Sudanese people and many others. At the end of the year, we will have the courage to ask ourselves how many human lives have been shattered by armed conflict, how many dead and how much destruction, how much suffering, how much poverty, the pontiff said. Whoever has interest in these conflicts, listen to the voice of conscience. In New Yorks Times Square, officials and party organizers say they are prepared to welcome tens of thousands of revelers to the heart of midtown Manhattan and ensure their safety. New York City Mayor Eric Adams said there were no specific threats to the annual New Years Eve bash, which will feature live performances from Flo Rida, Megan Thee Stallion and LL Cool J, as well as televised appearances from Cardi B and others. Organizers said in-person attendance is expected to return to pre-COVID levels, even as foot traffic around Times Square remains down slightly since the pandemic. Amid near-daily protests in New York sparked by the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza, police said they would expand the security perimeter around the party, creating a buffer zone that will allow them to head off potential demonstrations. We will be out here with our canines, on horseback, our helicopters, our boats, Adams said. Officials will also monitor protests with drones, he said. But as we saw last year, after having no specific threats, we get a threat. During last years New Years Eve party, a machete-wielding man attacked three police officers a few blocks from Times Square. Security will also be heightened across European cities on Sunday. In France, 90,000 law enforcement officers are set to be deployed, domestic intelligence chief Céline Berthon said Friday. Of those, 6,000 will be in Paris, where French Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin said over 1.5 million people are expected to attend celebrations on the Champs-Elysees. Darmanin cited a very high terrorist threat because, in part, of what is happening in Israel and Palestine, referring to the Israel-Hamas war. Darmanin said that police for the first time will be able to use drones as part of security work and that tens of thousands of firefighters and 5,000 soldiers would also be deployed. New Years Eve celebrations in the French capital will center on the 2024 Paris Olympic Games, including DJ sets, fireworks and video projections on the Arc de Triomphe, highlighting changes in the city and faces of the Games, according to the press service of the City of Paris. Other planned events include the largest Mexican wave ever performed and a giant karaoke. The security challenge ahead of the Olympics was highlighted when a tourist was killed in a knife attack near the Eiffel Tower on Dec. 2. Large-scale attacks  such as that at the Bataclan in 2015, when Islamic extremists invaded the music hall and shot up cafe terraces, killing 130 people  also loom large. In Berlin, some 4,500 police officers are expected to keep order and avoid riots like a year ago. Police in the German capital issued a ban on the traditional use of fire crackers for several streets across the city. They also banned a pro-Palestinian protest in the Neukoelln neighborhood of the city, which has seen several pro-Palestinian riots since the Oct. 7 attack by Hamas. In Russia, the countrys military actions in Ukraine have overshadowed end-of-year celebrations, with the usual fireworks and concert on Moscows Red Square canceled, as last year. After shelling in the center of the Russian border city of Belgorod Saturday killed 24 people, some local authorities across Russia also canceled their usual firework displays, including in Vladivostok. Millions throughout Russia are expected to tune into Russian President Vladimir Putins New Years address. In Muslim-majority Pakistan, the government has banned all New Years Eve celebrations as an act of solidarity with the Palestinians. In an overnight televised message, caretaker Prime Minister Anwaar-ul-Haq Kakar urged Pakistanis to show solidarity with the oppressed people of Gaza by beginning the new year with simplicity. Kakar said Muslims across the world were saddened over Israels attacks on Gaza that resulted in the killings of thousands of innocent people. Source: The Associated Press --Agencies",

        "date": "December 31, 2023 10:52 pm",
        "content": "Sri Lanka has informed India that it will not allow any Chinese research vessel to dock at its ports or operate within its exclusive economic zone (EEZ) for one year, the Hindustan Times reported on Sunday. The move comes after Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi urged President Ranil Wickremesinghe to respect Indian strategic and security concerns. Sri Lankas decision means that the Chinese research vessel Xiang Yang Hong 3 will not be granted clearance to conduct deep water exploration in the south Indian Ocean. Sri Lanka has informed India that it will not allow any Chinese research vessel to dock at its ports or operate within its exclusive economic zone (EEZ) for a period of one year, people aware of the matter were quoted as saying in the report. The move comes close on the heels of Prime Minister Narendra Modi urging President Ranil Wickremesinghe to respect Indian strategic and security concerns during their meeting on July 21, 2023. The declared moratorium was conveyed to India through apex diplomatic channels last week, the people cited above added. This means that Chinese scientific research vessel Xiang Yang Hong 3, which was scheduled to conduct deep water exploration in the south Indian Ocean from January 5, 2024 to late May, will not be granted a clearance by Sri Lankan authorities. China has also asked the current pro-Beijing Mohammed Muizzu regime in Maldives to let the 4,600-tonne Xiamen-based vessel conduct a survey off the coast of Male. The Wickremesinghe government notified the one-year moratorium last week after India and the US red-flagged Colombo entertaining Chinese scientific research vessels and ballistic missile trackers in the Indian Ocean and providing them logistical support, the people said. India had raised objections to Chinese research vessel Shi Yan 6 conducting a joint maritime survey with the Sri Lankan maritime agency in October-November, but Colombo allowed the vessel to dock at its seaport after Wickremesinghe visited Beijing for the 10the anniversary of Belt Road Initiative (BRI) on October 17-18. The research vessel reached Colombo on October 25, and crossed the Malacca Straits on December 2. The objections to both Shi Yan 6, which was expected to be back in Sri Lanka around March, and Xiang Yang Hong 3, were conveyed to Wickremesinghe by top Indian diplomatic interlocutors, the people added. In the past, Chinese research ships, ballistic missile trackers and hydrographic vessels have entered the Indian Ocean Region (IOR) and conducted deep surveys of the 90-degree ridge south of the Andamans and Nicobar Islands. For example, Deng Jiaxian, a Shupang-class hydrographic vessel, was deployed in IOR from August 10-24. The ship re-entered IOR through the Sunda Straits on August 28 and exited through the LombokOmbai Wetar Straits in early September 2023. On September 11, the same vessel was seen surveying the Philippines Sea. This year, at least 25 Chinese ships including PLA warships, submarines, ballistic missile trackers and research vessels operated in the IOR, much to the chagrin of India and the US. Since 2019, a total of 48 Chinese scientific research vessels have been deployed in IOR. Their generic area of activity has been near the east and west coastlines of India, and in the deep Indian Ocean. Source: The Hindustan Times --Agencies",

        "date": "December 31, 2023 11:00 pm",
        "content": "(Reuters) - Iranian-backed Houthi militants attacked a Maersk container vessel with missiles and small boats, prompting the company to pause all sailing through the Red Sea for 48 hours, Maersk said on Sunday. The crew of the Maersk Hangzhou crew was safe and there was no indication of fire onboard the vessel, which was fully manoeuvrable and continued its journey north to Port Suez, Maersk said. The attack was the latest by Houthi militants in Yemen, who have been targeting vessels in the Red Sea to show their support for Palestinian Islamist group Hamas fighting Israel in Gaza. The attacks have disrupted world trade, with major shipping companies taking the longer and costlier route around the Africas Cape of Good Hope rather than through the Suez Canal. The Red Sea is the entry point for ships using the Suez Canal, which handles about 12 of global trade and vital for the movement of goods between Asia and Europe. The United States launched Operation Prosperity Guardian on Dec. 19, saying more than 20 countries had agreed to participate in the efforts to safeguard ships in Red Sea waters near Yemen. In response, Maersk said on Dec. 24 it would resume sailings through the Red Sea. However, attacks have continued and U.S. allies have proven reluctant to commit to the coalition, with nearly half not declaring their presence publicly. Maersk, one of the worlds major cargo shippers, said on Sunday it would delay all transits through the area for 48 hours, after the Maersk Hangzhou was struck by a missile at around 1730 GMT on Saturday 55 nautical miles southwest of Al Hodeidah, Yemen. A U.S. warship shot down another two anti-ship ballistic missiles fired from Houthi-controlled areas in Yemen, according to the U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM). Later at around 0330 GMT on Sunday, the same ship was attacked by Houthi militants in four small boats. An attempt by the attackers to board the vessel was averted after its security team and helicopters from the USS Eisenhower and USS Gravely, responding to distress calls, returned fire, according to statements by Maersk and CENTCOM. The helicopters sank three of the militant boats, with no survivors, while the fourth boat fled the area, CENTCOM said in the statement. The Singapore-flagged Maersk Hangzhou with capacity to carry 14,000 containers was en route from Singapore. British Foreign Secretary David Cameron said on Sunday that he had told Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian in a call that Iran should help stop the Houthi attacks in the Red Sea. I made clear that Iran shares responsibility for preventing these attacks, given their long-standing support to the Houthis, Cameron said in a post on social media site X, adding that the attacks threaten innocent lives and the global economy. The BIMCO shipping association condemned the attacks and thanked those states involved in repelling them. We are thankful to U.S., French, and UK efforts so far and hope even more states will support the coalition with naval assets or other impactful means including diplomatic pressure on the Houthis and their sponsors, Jakob Larsen, BIMCOs head of maritime safety and security, told Reuters.

        "date": "January 1, 2024 08:15 am",
        "content": "(Reuters) - Denmarks Queen Margrethe II, Europes longest-serving monarch, will abdicate on Jan. 14 after 52 years on the throne and will be succeeded by her eldest son Crown Prince Frederik, she announced on Sunday. The 83-year-old queen, who ascended the throne in 1972, made the surprise announcement on live TV during her traditional New Years Eve speech, which is viewed by many in the country of 5.9 million people. Referring to a successful back operation she underwent in February, she said, The surgery naturally gave rise to thinking about the future - whether the time had come to leave the responsibility to the next generation. I have decided that now is the right time. On 14 January 2024  52 years after I succeeded my beloved father  I will step down as queen of Denmark, she said. I leave the throne to my son, Crown Prince Frederik, she said. The queen became the longest-serving monarch in Europe following the death of Britains Queen Elizabeth II in September 2022. In July, she became the longest-sitting monarch in Denmarks history. In Denmark, formal power resides with the elected parliament and its government. The monarch is expected to stay above partisan politics, representing the nation with traditional duties ranging from state visits to national day celebrations. Denmarks Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen thanked the queen for her life-long dedication to duty. It is still difficult to understand that the time has now come for a change of throne, Frederiksen said in a statement, adding that many Danes had never known another monarch. Queen Margrethe is the epitome of Denmark and throughout the years has put words and feelings into who we are as a people and as a nation, she said. Born in 1940 to Denmarks former monarch King Frederik IX and Queen Ingrid, Margrethe has throughout her life enjoyed broad support from Danes, who are fond of her tactful and yet creative personality. She is also known for her love of archaeology and has taken part in several excavations. She became heir to her father in 1953 at the age of 31, after a constitutional amendment allowed women to inherit the throne. In 1967, she married French diplomat Henri de Laborde de Monpezat, who served as her royal consort until his death in 2018. The couples two sons are Crown Prince Frederik, who will become King Frederik X, and Prince Joachim. Frederik married Mary Elizabeth Donaldson, an Australian, in 2004. Source: Ruters --Agencies",
