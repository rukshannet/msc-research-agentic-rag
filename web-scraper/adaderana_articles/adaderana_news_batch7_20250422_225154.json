        "title": "Cory Booker breaks record for longest Senate speech after 24 hours",
        "date": "April 2, 2025 08:42 am",
        "content": "US Senator Cory Booker has broken the record for the longest speech ever delivered in the Senate. The New Jersey Democrats marathon address, a symbolic protest against President Donald Trump, in which he warned of a grave and urgent moment in American history, ended after for 25 hours and four minutes. Although it was not a filibuster - a speech designed to obstruct passage of a bill - it held up legislative business in the Republican-controlled Senate. The rules for such speeches require a speaker to remain standing and forgo bathroom breaks. The previous record was held by Republican Senator Strom Thurmond, who spoke for 24 hours and 18 minutes against the Civil Rights Act in 1957. Booker said he would speak for as long as he was physically able as he began his address at around 19:00 local time on Monday evening. He concluded at 20:06 on Tuesday. The 55-year-old, who is the fourth-ranking Democrat in the chamber, filled some of the time reading letters from constituents, who said they had been harmed by President Trumps policies. The former presidential candidate also ran out the clock by discussing sports, reciting poetry and taking questions from colleagues. Booker, who is African-American, spoke of his roots as the descendant of both slaves and slave-owners. Im here because as powerful as he was, the people are more powerful, he said, referring to segregationist Thurmonds record-setting address 68 years ago. As he reached the milestone, Booker said he was going to deal with some of the biological urgencies Im feeling. He was able to give his jaw much-needed respite during the speech by taking questions from colleagues, including Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer of New York, Senator Dick Durbin of Illinois and Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York. The Democratic Party, currently out of power in the White House, Senate and House of Representatives, rallied behind Bookers symbolic act of protest. Bookers speech is also the longest in the Senate since a 21-hour filibuster in 2013 by Texas Senator Ted Cruz, a Republican, against Obamacare. Cruz told CBS, the BBCs US partner, that a filibuster is a challenging physical feat. For his own protest, he wore comfortable shoes and tried to drink as little water as possible - an approach he described as nothing in, nothing out. Source: BBC --Agencies",

According to the National Center for Seismology (NCS), the tremors were felt in several parts of the country at around 2.58 am (IST). The United States Geological Survey (USGS) reported that the epicenter was located 65 kilometers east-southeast of Uthal in Balochistan, at a depth of 10 kilometers. This is not the first time Pakistan has experienced seismic activity this year. Earlier, on February 28, a 4.5-magnitude earthquake was recorded with its epicenter within Pakistan itself. Just weeks before, on February 16, tremors were felt with the epicenter located 8 kilometers southeast of Rawalpindi, at a depth of 17 kilometers. These shocks were also experienced in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. No reports of injuries or casualties so far So far, there have been no reports of injuries or casualties in Pakistan, but the tremors have struck at a time when the world is witnessing the destructive force of earthquakes in Myanmar and Thailand. The massive 7.7-magnitude earthquake that struck Myanmar last week has claimed over 2,700 lives and also left thousands injured. The quake struck on March 28, with its impact felt across regions from Bangkok to India. In Bangkok, the disaster turned tragic as a building collapsed, leading to the death of at least 30 people.

        "title": "Putin begins biggest Russian military call-up in years",
        "date": "April 2, 2025 10:46 am",
        "content": "President Vladimir Putin has called up 160,000 men aged 18-30, Russias highest number of conscripts since 2011, as the country moves to expand the size of its military. The spring call-up for a years military service came several months after Putin said Russia should increase the overall size of its military to almost 2.39 million and its number of active servicemen to 1.5 million. That is a rise of 180,000 over the coming three years. Vice Adm Vladimir Tsimlyansky said the new conscripts would not be sent to fight in Ukraine for what Russia calls its special military operation. However, there have been reports of conscripts being killed in fighting in Russias border regions and they were sent to fight in Ukraine in the early months of the full-scale war. The current draft, which takes place between April and July, comes despite US attempts to forge a ceasefire in the war. There was no let-up in the violence on Tuesday, with Ukraine saying that a Russian attack on a power facility in the southern city of Kherson had left 45,000 people without electricity. Although Russia has turned down a full US-brokered ceasefire with Ukraine, it says it did agree to stop attacking Ukraines energy facilities. In an apparent attempt to deny Moscow had broken the terms of that deal, Russian officials said they had told Putin that Ukrainian drones had carried out attacks with little sign of a break. Russia calls up conscripts in the spring and autumn but the latest draft of 160,000 young men is 10,000 higher than the same period in 2024. Since the start of last year, the pool of young men available for the draft has been increased by raising the maximum age from 27 to 30. As well as call-up notices delivered by post, Russias young men will be receiving notifications on the state services website Gosuslugi. In Moscow there were reports that call-ups had already been sent out on 1 April via the mos.ru city website. Increasing numbers of Russians are trying to avoid the army by taking on alternative civilian service. But human rights lawyer Timofey Vaskin warned on independent Russian media that every new call-up since the start of the war had become a lottery: Authorities are coming up with new forms of refilling the army. Quite apart from its twice-yearly draft, Russia has also called up large numbers of men as contract soldiers and recruited thousands of soldiers from North Korea. Moscow has had to respond to extensive losses in Ukraine, with more than 100,000 verified by the BBC and Mediazona as soldiers killed in Ukraine. The true number could be more than double. Putin has scaled up the size of the military three times since he ordered troops to capture Ukraine in February 2022. Russias defence ministry linked the December 2023 increase in the size of the military to growing threats from both the war in Ukraine and the ongoing expansion of Nato. Nato has expanded to include Finland and Sweden, as a direct result of Russias invasion of Ukraine. Finland has Natos longest border with Russia, at 1,343km (834 miles) and Prime Minister Petteri Orpo said on Tuesday that his country would join other states neighbouring Russia in pulling out of the Ottawa convention banning anti-personnel mines. Poland and the Baltic states made similar decisions two weeks ago because of the military threat from Russia. Orpo said the decision to resume using anti-personnel mines was based on military advice, and that the people of Finland had nothing to worry about. The government in Helsinki also said defence spending would be increased to 3 of economic output (GDP), up from 2.4 last year. Source: BBC --Agencies",

        "title": "Val Kilmer, film star known for Top Gun, Batman Forever and Tombstone, dead at 65",
        "date": "April 2, 2025 10:55 am",
        "content": "Val Kilmer, a movie star in the 1980s and 90s who played everything from Batman to Doc Holliday, died on Tuesday, according to his daughter Mercedes Kilmer, who released a statement to the New York Times and the Associated Press. He was 65. The cause of death was pneumonia, Mercedes Kilmer told the media outlets. CNN has reached out to representatives for Kilmer and his family for comment. Kilmer had recovered from a 2014 throat cancer diagnosis that required tracheotomy surgery that altered his voice. He largely stepped away from acting, though he reprised his role as Tom Iceman Kazansky in the wildly successful and long-awaited film, Top Gun: Maverick, which released in 2022 after a two-year delay. Kilmers Iceman was the cocky but cool rival to Tom Cruises Pete Maverick Mitchell in the original film. The sequel deftly blended Kilmers off-screen health issues into the films story, giving it a real-life emotional layer. David Rooney, The Hollywood Reporters chief film critic, wrote in his review that Top Gun: Mavericks most moving element comes during the brief screen time of Kilmers Iceman, whose health issues reflect those suffered by the actor in real life, generating resonant pathos. Theres reciprocal warmth, even love, in a scene between Iceman and Maverick that acknowledges the characters hard-won bond as well as the rivalry that preceded it, with gentle humor, Rooney wrote. As one of Kilmers last film roles, it concluded one of the most interesting  and bankable  careers in Hollywood history. Kilmers films made nearly 2 billion at the global box office, according to Comscore. Kilmers acting career was rooted in the theater. Born and raised in Californias San Fernando Valley, he studied at the Hollywood Professional School before heading to New York where, at 21, he became the youngest student at the time to be accepted into Julliard Schools drama department. He began his film career in the 1984 comedy Top Secret! and acted in several movies throughout the 80s including his breakout role in 1986s Top Gun. Kilmer starred in a long streak of successful genre-spanning movies in the 1990s: Superhero films like 1995s Batman Forever in which he played the Dark Knight, and memorable turns in Westerns as Doc Holliday in 1993s Tombstone, biopics as Jim Morrison in 1991s The Doors and in crime films as a bank robber in Michael Manns 1995 masterpiece, Heat. Kilmer shared an intimate look at his life and career in the 2021 documentary Val through interactions he had videotaped with his family and on film sets for years, including behind-the-scenes footage from Tombstone and the Top Gun cast partying after hours (We were all at the start of our careers, Kilmer recalled). At the time, Kilmer was recovering from throat-cancer surgery, so his son, Jack, read the actors written narration  sounding uncannily like his father. Throughout his career, the roles that Kilmer played possessed an iconic quality while underscoring the way his career frequently zigged at the point where it could have zagged, to his detriment if not in terms of the quality of the work but how Hollywood and the public perceived him. Kilmer enthusiastically agreed to star as Batman, for example, but quickly soured on that experience, passing on another sequel in favor of the forgettable reboot The Saint. Similarly, he took a role in The Island of Dr. Moreau in order to play opposite Marlon Brando, only to clash with director John Frankenheimer (exchanges caught on camera) and be disappointed when a detached Brando periodically refused to come to the set, letting a stand-in take his place. Kilmer spoke frequently about his desire to work with certain directors, showing audition videos that he shot for parts he failed to land in Goodfellas and Full Metal Jacket, seeking to impress directors Martin Scorsese and Stanley Kubrick, respectively. He also documented his laborious auditioning and preparation process for portraying Jim Morrison in The Doors. Kilmer is survived by his two adult children, Jack and Mercedes, from his marriage to Willow co-star Joanne Whalley. The younger Kilmers are both actors and have been involved in projects with their father. Kilmer co-starred with Mercedes in the 2020 film Paydirt and, in addition to voicing the Val documentary, Jack lent his voice to his fathers character on the Disney Willow series. Despite his condition at the time of the 2021 documentary, and tragedies that included the death of his younger brother at age 15, Kilmer spoke of leading a magical life. He said that he found the silver lining even as he endured fans asking for the same Top Gun-inspired You can be my wingman autograph over and over at Comic-Con. I feel grateful, he said.

A notable increase in rice prices has been observed in the market, along with reports of shortages in certain rice varieties, despite the current harvest season, according to the Presidents Media Division (PMD). Given this situation, discussions were held regarding the need for the Cabinet to prioritize the maintenance of sufficient stock levels through rice imports. The Committee, chaired by Minister of Agriculture, Livestock, Lands and Irrigation K.D. Lalkantha and Minister of Trade, Commerce, Food Security and Cooperative Development Vasantha Samarasinghe, convened for the fifth time at the Presidential Secretariat on April 01 (Tuesday). The meeting aimed to formulate policy decisions to ensure food security. During the discussions, it was revealed that due to excessive rainfall this year, crop damage occurred on two occasions, leading to a significant reduction in the expected harvest, the PMD said. Furthermore, during the meeting it was stated that the improper use of rice for animal feed is another major reason contributing to the rice shortage. As a result, the Committee also focused on the importation of broken rice for animal feed and the use of alternative feeds to mitigate the impact on livestock production, it added. Accordingly, the Food Policy and Security Committee approved the formation of a Committee, led by the Director General of Agriculture, to oversee the importation of the required quantity of broken rice through proper mechanisms. Secretary to the Prime Minister Pradeep Saputhanthri, Senior Additional Secretary to the President Kapila Janaka Bandara, and other members of the Food Policy and Security Committee, including Ministry Secretaries, also participated in the discussions. --PMD",

        "content": "Earthquake of magnitude 6.0 strikes Japans Kyushu, the Japan Meteorological Agency said that the earthquake struck at 7.34 (local time) at a depth of 40km. The earthquake comes days after a 7.7-magnitude earthquake flattened buildings across Myanmar, killing more than 2,800 people and making thousands more homeless. On Monday, a report by the Japanese government said that a megaquake and subsequent tsunami could cause as many as 298,000 deaths in Japan and damage costing up to 2 trillion. A megaquake refers to an extremely powerful earthquake, typically magnitude 8 or higher, capable of causing widespread destruction and potentially triggering a tsunami. The updated figures revise a 2014 estimate that assessed the potential impact of a massive earthquake along the Nankai Trough, an 800-kilometer (500-mile) undersea trench stretching from Shizuoka, west of Tokyo, to the southern tip of Kyushu. This trench is where the Philippine Sea tectonic plate is gradually subducted beneath the continental plate on which Japan rests. Over time, the plates become locked, accumulating energy that is eventually released in the form of major earthquakes. In August last year, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) issued its first-ever megaquake advisory under post-2011 rules, following a magnitude 7.1 earthquake in southern Japan that injured 14 people. Earlier in January of the same year, a massive earthquake struck Japans Noto Peninsula, killing at least 260 people, including 30 quake-related deaths. Source: The Hindustan Times --Agencies",

        "date": "April 3, 2025 06:07 am",
        "content": "United States President Donald Trump on Wednesday announced a sweeping set of reciprocal tariffs, imposing a baseline 10 per cent tax on all imports and significantly higher rates on dozens of countries with which the US runs trade deficits. The sweeping duties, which drew bewildered condemnation from many long-standing U.S. allies who found themselves tagged with unexpectedly high tariff rates, promise to erect new barriers around the worlds largest consumer economy, reversing decades of trade liberalization that have shaped the global order. In a statement delivered from the White House Rose Garden, Trump described the measure as a declaration of economic independence and vowed to boost domestic production by levelling the playing field with foreign competitors. Trading partners are expected to respond with countermeasures of their own that could lead to dramatically higher prices for everything from bicycles to wine. U.S. stock futures dropped sharply after the announcement, following weeks of volatile trading as investors speculated about how the incoming tariffs might affect the global economy, inflation and corporate earnings. U.S. stocks have erased nearly 5 trillion of value since mid-February. The new tariff structure introduces a 10 per cent flat rate on all imports and applies higher rates to several major trading partners. At 49 per cent, Cambodia faces the steepest tariff, followed closely by Vietnam at 46 per cent, Sri Lanka at 44 per cent, and China at 34 per cent. Trump also announced a 26 per cent discounted reciprocal tariff on imports from India. Sri Lanka faces the 6th highest tariff rates in the world, while currently 25 of the island nations total exports go to the US. The reciprocal tariffs, Trump said, were a response to duties and other non-tariff barriers put on U.S. goods. He argued that the new levies will boost manufacturing jobs at home. Outside economists have warned that tariffs could slow the global economy, raise the risk of recession, and increase living costs for the average U.S. family by thousands of dollars. Canada and Mexico, the two largest U.S. trading partners, already face 25 tariffs on many goods and will not face additional levies from Wednesdays announcement. Even some fellow Republicans have expressed concern about Trumps aggressive trade policy. Within hours of Wednesdays announcement, the Senate voted 51-48 to approve legislation that would terminate Trumps Canadian tariffs, with a handful of Republicans breaking with the president. Passage in the Republican-controlled U.S. House of Representatives, however, was seen as unlikely. Trumps top economist, Stephen Miran, told Fox Business on Wednesday the tariffs would work out well for the U.S. in the long run, even if they cause some initial disruption. Tariff concerns have already slowed manufacturing activity across the globe, while also spurring sales of autos and other imported products as consumers rush to make purchases before prices rise. European leaders reacted with dismay, saying a trade war would hurt consumers and benefit neither side. Countries facing the highest tariffs (40 per cent and above): Lesotho: 50 per cent (charges US 99 per cent) Saint Pierre and Miquelon: 50 per cent (charges US 99 per cent) Cambodia: 49 per cent (charges US 97 per cent) Laos: 48 per cent (charges US 95 per cent) Madagascar: 47 per cent (charges US 93 per cent) Vietnam: 46 per cent (charges US 90 per cent) Myanmar: 44 percent (charges US 88 per cent) Sri Lanka: 44 per cent (charges US 88 per cent) Falkland Islands: 41 per cent (charges US 82 per cent) Syria: 41 per cent (charges US 81 per cent) Moderate-to-high tariffs (20 to 39 per cent): Iraq: 39 per cent (charges US 78 per cent) Guyana: 38 per cent (charges US 76 per cent) Bangladesh: 37 per cent (charges US 74 per cent) Botswana: 37 per cent (charges US 74 per cent) Reunion: 37 per cent (charges US 73 per cent) Serbia: 37 per cent (charges US 74 per cent) Thailand: 36 per cent (charges US 72 per cent) Bosnia and Herzegovina: 35 per cent (charges US 70 per cent) Tunisia: 28 per cent (charges US 55 per cent) Kazakhstan: 27 per cent (charges US 54 per cent) India: 26 per cent (charges US 52 per cent) South Korea: 25 per cent (charges US 50 per cent) Japan: 24 per cent (charges US 46 per cent) Malaysia: 24 per cent (charges US 47 per cent) Cote dIvoire: 21 per cent (charges US 41 per cent) Namibia: 21 per cent (charges US 42 per cent) European Union: 20 per cent (charges US 39 per cent) Jordan: 20 per cent (charges US 40 per cent) Low or standardised tariffs (10 to 19 per cent): Nicaragua: 18 per cent (charges US 36 per cent) Malawi: 17 per cent (charges US 34 per cent) Philippines: 17 per cent (charges US 34 per cent) Israel: 17 per cent (charges US 33 per cent) Zambia: 17 per cent (charges US 33 per cent) Mozambique: 16 per cent (charges US 31 per cent) Venezuela: 15 per cent (charges US 29 per cent) Nigeria: 14 per cent (charges US 27 per cent) Equatorial Guinea: 13 per cent (charges US 25 per cent) Cameroon: 11 per cent (charges US 22 per cent) Argentina: 10 per cent (charges US 10 per cent) Australia: 10 per cent (charges US 10 per cent) Azerbaijan: 10 per cent (charges US 10 per cent) Bahamas: 10 per cent (charges US 10 per cent) Bahrain: 10 per cent (charges US 10 per cent) Bolivia: 10 per cent (charges US 20 per cent) Brazil: 10 per cent (charges US 10 per cent) Chile: 10 per cent (charges US 10 per cent) Colombia: 10 per cent (charges US 10 per cent) Costa Rica: 10 per cent (charges US 17 per cent) Dominican Republic: 10 per cent (charges US 10 per cent) Ecuador: 10 per cent (charges US 12 per cent) Egypt: 10 per cent (charges US 10 per cent) El Salvador: 10 per cent (charges US 10 per cent) Ethiopia: 10 per cent (charges US 10 per cent) Georgia: 10 per cent (charges US 10 per cent) Ghana: 10 per cent (charges US 17 per cent) Guatemala: 10 per cent (charges US 10 per cent) Haiti: 10 per cent (charges US 10 per cent) Honduras: 10 per cent (charges US 10 per cent) Iceland: 10 per cent (charges US 10 per cent) Jamaica: 10 per cent (charges US 10 per cent) Kenya: 10 per cent (charges US 10 per cent) Lebanon: 10 per cent (charges US 10 per cent) Morocco: 10 per cent (charges US 10 per cent) New Zealand: 10 per cent (charges US 20 per cent) Oman: 10 per cent (charges US 10 per cent) Panama: 10 per cent (charges US 10 per cent) Paraguay: 10 per cent (charges US 10 per cent) Peru: 10 per cent (charges US 10 per cent) Qatar: 10 per cent (charges US 10 per cent) Saudi Arabia: 10 per cent (charges US 10 per cent) Senegal: 10 per cent (charges US 10 per cent) Singapore: 10 per cent (charges US 10 per cent) Tanzania: 10 per cent (charges US 10 per cent) Trinidad and Tobago: 10 per cent (charges US 12 per cent) Turkey: 10 per cent (charges US 10 per cent) UAE: 10 per cent (charges US 10 per cent) Uganda: 10 per cent (charges US 20 per cent) Ukraine: 10 per cent (charges US 10 per cent) United Kingdom: 10 per cent (charges US 10 per cent) Uruguay: 10 per cent (charges US 10 per cent) The move, part of Trumps broader Liberation Day economic agenda, is considered by his administration as a key strategy to rectify what it sees as unfair trade practices by imposing duties that match those levied by other countries on US products. However, economists warn the move may prompt retaliatory measures and raise prices for American consumers already struggling with inflation. --Agencies",

        "title": "How Trumps new US tariffs can impact Sri Lankas exports",
        "date": "April 3, 2025 07:12 am",
        "content": "The higher trade tariffs imposed by the United States on Sri Lanka can put a significant number of jobs in the countrys apparel industry at risk in the near future, warns Professor Wasantha Athukorala from the Department of Economics and Statistics at the University of Peradeniya. On Wednesday, US President Donald Trump announced a sweeping set of reciprocal tariffs, imposing a baseline 10 tax on all imports and significantly higher rates on dozens of countries with which the US runs trade deficits. As a result, Sri Lanka now faces the 6th highest tariff rates in the world44, a sharp increase from the previous 12.2 tariff rate. Currently, 25 of Sri Lankas total exportsprimarily apparelare destined for the US. Reports indicate that Sri Lankas export earnings from the US amounted to USD 3 billion in 2024, with USD 346 million earned in January 2025 alone. However, Prof. Athukorala warns that these high tariffs could severely impact Sri Lankas exports, particularly the apparel industry, as the US remains a key market for the countrys textiles. He cautioned that export income could decline significantly, posing a serious threat to employment in the sector. Furthermore, he stressed that if Sri Lankas exports take a hit, a large number of workers in the apparel industry could lose their jobs in the near future.",

        "date": "April 3, 2025 07:32 am",
        "content": "Global financial markets, including in Asia were rocked on Wednesday by Donald Trumps announcement of sweeping tariffs, targeting China and the European Union in particular, with the risk of undermining the international economy. The US president laid out the new measures after Wall Street stock markets had closed. But his announcement still rippled through the markets that were open at the time, sending stock futures and bond yields lower, while gold surged to a new record high. Stocks struggle As the evening progressed, US futures fell sharply, with the Dow Jones dropping 2.4 percent at around 2345 GMT, the Nasdaq index plunging 4.2 percent, and the broader futures index for the SP 500 falling 3.5 percent. Wall Street has largely suffered from Trumps various trade announcements in recent weeks. The silver lining for investors could be that this is only a starting point for negotiations with other countries and ultimately tariff rates will come down across the board, Northlight Asset Managements Chris Zaccarelli wrote in a note to clients. But for now traders are shooting first and asking questions later, he added. The share price of technology companies whose components are produced abroad also fell sharply, with Apple losing 7.4 percent after-hours, Nvidia falling 5.2 percent and TSMC declining 5.9 percent. Futures markets are typically much more volatile than the regular indices. The clothing sector was also hit especially hard, with a particularly heavy bill for China, where products will be hit by an additional duty of 34 percent from April 9, and Vietnam, where the new reciprocal rate will be 46 percent. Brands whose clothes are partly made in China or Vietnam were sharply lower, with Gap down 8.5 percent after hours, Ralph Lauren falling 7.3 percent, and Nike losing 7.1 percent. Tokyos Nikkei 225 index dipped more than 3.4, but recovered slightly. It was down 2.9 at 34,699.52. Trump said he was imposing a 24 reciprocal tariff on Japan, one of the United States closest allies. South Korea, also an ally, was hit with a 25 tariff. Its benchmark Kospi slumped 1.9 soon after the opening, to 2,459.30. In Australia, the SPASX 200 fell 1.8 to 7,793.10. The future for the SP 500 dropped 3 while that for the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 2, auguring potential losses when U.S. markets reopen on Thursday (April 3, 2025). On Wednesday (April 2, 2025), U.S. stocks whipped through another dizzying day before Mr. Trumps unveiling of his Liberation Day tariffs. The SP 500 rose 0.7 to 5,670.97 after careening between an earlier loss of 1.1 and a later gain of 1.1. Its had a pattern this week of opening with sharp drops only to finish the day higher. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.6 to 42,225.32, and the Nasdaq composite climbed 0.9 to 17,601.05. Elon Musks Tesla helped knock the market around after initially falling more than 6 following a report that it delivered fewer electric vehicles in the first three months of the year than it did in last years first quarter. It closed 5.3 higher. Tesla is one of Wall Streets most influential stocks because of its immense size, and its faced backlash due to anger about CEO Elon Musks leading the U.S. governments efforts to cut spending. On Wall Street, Newsmax fell 77.5 in its third day of trading to give back some of the meteoric gains from its debut at the start of the week. It surged 735 Monday and then another 179 on Tuesday. Several airlines, meanwhile, flew higher to recover some of the sharp losses taken recently on worries that tariff-weary customers will fly less. United Airlines climbed 4.6. Financial markets around the world have broadly been shaky lately because of uncertainty about Trumps trade war. He has said he wants tariffs to make the global system more fair and to bring manufacturing jobs back to the United States from other countries. But tariffs also threaten to grind down growth for the U.S. and other economies, while worsening inflation when it may be stuck above the Federal Reserves 2 target. After the U.S. market closed, Mr. Trump declared a 10 baseline tax on imports from all countries and higher tariff rates on dozens of nations that run trade surpluses with the United States. The president held up a chart while speaking at the White House, showing the United States would charge a 34 tax on imports from China, a 20 tax on imports from the European Union, and 32 on Taiwan. Mr. Trump earlier announced 25 tariffs on auto imports; levies against China, Canada and Mexico; and expanded tariffs on steel and aluminium. Trump has also put tariffs against countries that import oil from Venezuela and plans separate import taxes on pharmaceutical drugs, lumber, copper and computer chips. Treasury yields swung in the bond market, echoing the indecision seen in the stock market. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell as low as 4.11 in the morning from 4.17 late Tuesday (April 1, 2025) and from roughly 4.8 early this year. But it later rose to 4.18. Higher yields can indicate higher expectations for the economy or for inflation In other dealings early Thursday (April 3, 2025), U.S. benchmark crude plunged 2.08 to 69.63 per barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, gave up 2.06 to 72.89 per barrel. The dollar fell to 148.07 Japanese yen from 149.28 yen. The euro rose to 1.0897 from 1.0855. Safe-haven assets in demand Investors flocked to gold, which has been setting new records in the face of trade uncertainties. The yellow metal blew past its previous days record high after Donald Trumps new announcements, and was trading at roughly 3,160 an ounce at around 2345 GMT. The price of gold has jumped by close to 20 percent since the start of 2025. The bond market also played its role as a safe haven, with the yield on the benchmark ten-year US Treasury, easing to 4.10 percent after Donald Trumps announcement. Bond yields move in the opposite direction to prices, with yields typically falling in the face of increased demand for bonds. Weaker dollar Within minutes of Trumps first words on Wednesday, the dollar plunged by over one percent against the euro. The increased tariffs have been a negative factor for the US dollar, Forex.coms Matthew Weller told AFP. One euro was equivalent to 1.04 dollars on the day Trump was inaugurated to his second term. By 2345 GMT on Wednesday, it was worth around 1.09 dollars. Bitcoin, the most popular cryptocurrency, also suffered from the White House announcements, falling more than three percent on Wednesday evening. --Agencies",

        "date": "April 3, 2025 10:49 am",
        "content": "European visitors to Britain will have to purchase an electronic permit in advance for trips from Wednesday, as the UK government follows other countries in seeking to strengthen immigration security by screening people before they cross its borders. The Electronic Travel Authorisation (ETA) scheme requires all visitors who do not need a visa to enter Britain to purchase pre-travel authorisation online at a cost of 10 pounds (12 euros), rising to 16 pounds from April 9. Irish citizens are excluded. The regime was initially rolled out to non-European nationals last year, including visitors from the United States, Canada and Australia. Expanding ETA worldwide cements our commitment to enhance security through technology and innovation, migration minister Seema Malhotra said last month. Britains Home Office, or interior ministry, said applying for an ETA should be simple through the UK ETA app, with the vast majority of applicants receiving a decision automatically in minutes. Applicants provide a photo and biographic details and answer questions on suitability and criminality. Once an applicant has successfully applied, their ETA is digitally linked to their passport. An ETA allows multiple visits to the UK of up to six months over a two-year period. Airlines, ferry and train companies will be responsible for verifying the ETA status of travellers before they board. Budget airline easyJet said on Tuesday it did not expect the new permit requirement to dent demand for Europe to UK travel. The United Kingdom received 22.5 million visitors from the European Union in 2023, up from 19.0 million in 2022, according to official data. The EUs much delayed post-Brexit border security checks for UK nationals entering the bloc are slated to be introduced in October. Britain left the EU in 2020. The EUs EntryExit System (EES) will remove the requirement to manually stamp passports at the EUs external borders and instead create digital records that link a travel document to a persons identity using biometrics. EES will be a precursor to an enhanced system, the European Travel Information and Authorisation System (ETIAS), which will also require non-Schengen area citizens to pay a fee before they travel. Britons currently pay about 17 pounds for a similar permit to enter the U.S. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "title": "Oil prices drop as Trumps higher-than-expected tariffs spark global trade war",
        "date": "April 3, 2025 11:12 am",
        "content": "Oil prices fell by as much as 3 today after U.S. President Donald Trump announced sweeping new tariffs that investors worry will spark a global trade war that will curtail economic growth and limit fuel demand. Brent futures were down 1.60, or 2.13, to 73.35 a barrel by 0331 GMT after dropping by as much as 3.2 earlier, its biggest daily percentage decline since March 5. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures were down 1.62, or 2.26, to 70.09 after slipping by as much as 3.4 earlier. Trump on Wednesday unveiled a 10 minimum tariff on most goods imported to the United States, the worlds biggest oil consumer, with much higher duties on products from dozens of countries, kicking into high gear a global trade war that threatens to drive up inflation and stall U.S. and worldwide economic growth. The US tariff announcement clearly caught markets off guard. Pre-announcement speculation suggested a flat 15-20 tariff, but the final decision was more hawkish, Yeap Jun Rong, market strategist at IG, said in an email. For oil prices, the focus now shifts to the global growth outlook, which is likely to be revised downward due to these higher-than-expected tariffs, he added. Imports of oil, gas and refined products were exempted from the new tariffs, the White House said on Wednesday. The tariffs sent markets reeling on Thursday, with Japans Nikkei (.N225), opens new tab plunging to an eight-month low, Chinas yuan dropped to its lowest levels in seven weeks and stock markets slumped in early Asia trade. We know it will be negative for trade, economic growth and thus oil demand growth. But we dont know how bad it will be as the effects come a little bit down the road, said Bjarne Schieldrop, chief commodities analyst at SEB. On Wednesday, UBS analysts cut their oil forecasts by 3 barrels over 2025-2026 to 72 per barrel, citing weaker fundamentals. Traders and analysts now expect more price volatility in the near term, as the tariffs may change as countries try to negotiate lower rates or enact retaliatory levies. Reinforcing the bearish sentiment, the Energy Information Administration data on Wednesday showed U.S. crude inventories rose by a surprisingly large 6.2 million barrels last week, against analysts forecasts for a decline of 2.1 million barrels. Inventories gained amid a surge in imports from Canada, which had expected to be hit with tariffs on its crude shipments to the U.S. The EIA data also showed gasoline demand was lower last week and refinery runs were lower at a time of year that plants should be producing more fuel ahead of the summer driving season.

        "date": "April 3, 2025 11:42 am",
        "content": "As the weekend deadline for TikTok to find a buyer approaches, bidders for the short-video social media site are piling up. Amazon and, separately, a consortium led by OnlyFans founder Tim Stokely are the latest to throw their hats into the ring for TikTok. The site faces an April 5 deadline to reach a deal to find a non-Chinese buyer under threat of being banned from the United States. U.S. officials have raised security concerns over the apps ties to China, which TikTok and owner ByteDance have denied. Trump administration officials are meeting on Wednesday to discuss the various options for TikTok. Startup Zoop, which is run by Stokely, founder of adult content social media site OnlyFans, has partnered with a cryptocurrency foundation to submit a late-stage plan to bid for TikTok, the two told Reuters Wednesday. A U.S. administration official confirmed Amazon had sent a letter to Vice President JD Vance and Department of Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick. Amazon declined to comment, while TikTok and ByteDance did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Shares of Amazon rose about 2 following news of the last-minute TikTok bid. Amazon has long harbored ambitions for an in-house social media network that could help it sell more goods and appeal to a younger audience. It bought live video site Twitch in 2014 for nearly 1 billion and book review site Goodreads in 2013 as part of its efforts to build a viable social network. Amazon also developed and tested a TikTok-like short-form video and photo feed called Inspire that it shuttered earlier this year. Trump said last month his administration was in touch with four different groups about the sale of the platform, without identifying them. Private equity firm Blackstone is discussing joining ByteDances non-Chinese shareholders, led by Susquehanna International Group and General Atlantic, in contributing fresh capital to bid for TikToks U.S. business, Reuters reported last week. U.S. venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz is also in talks to add outside funding to buy out TikToks Chinese investors, as part of a bid led by Oracle and other American investors to carve it out of ByteDance, the Financial Times reported on Tuesday. White House-led talks entail plans to spin off a U.S. entity for TikTok and dilute Chinese ownership in the new business to below a 20 threshold required by U.S. law, Reuters reported last month. The New York Times first reported Amazons involvement on Wednesday. Various parties who have been involved in the talks do not appear to be taking Amazons bid seriously, the Times reported. The future of the app used by nearly half of all Americans has been up in the air since a 2024 law, passed with overwhelming bipartisan support, required ByteDance to divest TikTok by January 19. Washington officials have said TikToks ownership by ByteDance makes it beholden to the Chinese government, and Beijing could use the app to conduct influence operations against the United States and collect data on Americans.

        "date": "April 3, 2025 11:59 am",
        "content": "A developer behind titles in the Call of Duty (CoD) series has defended the effect of video games on young men. Pete Actipis says makers like him are not here to dictate anything other than an outlet for enjoyment and entertainment for a player. It follows criticism by former England manager Sir Gareth Southgate, who said he feared young men were falling into unhealthy alternatives like gaming. Every person can determine whats right for their situation, for their family, Pete tells BBC Newsbeat. You can look at anything and say its a problem, adds Pete, whose work as designer includes CoD titles such as last years Black Ops 6. Its just really about how you use the medium. Sir Gareth referenced gaming, gambling and pornography when discussing young men in the UK during a speech at the BBCs annual Richard Dimbleby Lecture in March. And the subject has since been brought into even sharper focus by hit Netflix drama Adolescence. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer described the series, which tells the story of a 13-year-old boy accused of murdering a girl from his class, as really hard to watch. CoD designer Pete feels gaming isnt any more responsible for negatively influencing young players than any of their other interests. Gaming has its place with everything else, he says. It depends what youre looking for and how you handle the moderation of that, how you handle what it means to your life. Its kind of a personal journey from there. He also denied the CoD series has a responsibility to educate younger gamers about violence. Its latest title was rated as suitable for players aged 18 and above by PEGI, which sets age recommendations for games in Europe. Double-edged sword CoD player Rhys tells Newsbeat that while he accepts abusive behaviour can take place, he believes playing games doesnt necessarily have a negative influence on male players. People look at someone playing games for eight hours and think hes not really doing much. But he might be preparing for a tournament. That could be worth a months salary, sometimes a yearly salary for some people. Its a double-edged sword, he says. Gamer Abi, who plays and streams as AbiCoops, has mixed feelings about her gaming experiences. I had a stalker, she says. Id block his account, hed make new accounts and actually re-bought the game CoD to constantly try and find me in it. Abi adds shes had derogatory things said to her by other male players. About sexual assault, about rape, the stereotypical go back to the kitchen. It really messes with your mental health. Well be fat-shamed, bullied about our appearance, bullied about whether youre in a relationship. They will nit-pick everything about you just to get to you but women do it to women as well, she says. Despite the abuse and harassment, Abi says she wont back down to it because of the positive impact gaming has had on her life. I met all of my friends online. Ive made friendships, its brought my family closer together, I met my partner through gaming. And CoD developer Pete Actipis claims its positive impact on players hit new heights during Covid lockdowns. People were stuck in their house, he says. The game was actually a very social experience. A lot of memories were formed, a lot of friendships were formed, online. That period in the series history is virtually bringing players together again in 2025. An update to Call of Duty: Warzone has revived a fan favourite - a map called Verdansk, based in Ukraine, where people around the world can play each other online. For Rhys, it brings back memories of bonding with other players during the UKs tightest Covid restrictions. It gave players the opportunity to just get to know each other, Rhys says. I built bonds with people I now class as really good friends. Its a really bizarre and amazing experience. Source: BBC --Agencies",

Tennakoon was remanded until today, after he surrendered to the court on March 19. Tennakoon, who was subject to an arrest warrant in connection with a shooting incident near a hotel in the Pelena area of Weligama in 2023, surrendered to the court by submitting a motion after absconding for nearly 20 days. Following his surrender, the Matara Magistrate ordered that the suspect be remanded until today. The Matara Magistrates Court had previously issued an arrest order for eight police officers, including former officers of the Colombo Crimes Division (CCD) and IGP Deshabandu Tennakoon, naming them as suspects in the shooting incident that occurred in front of the W15 Hotel in the Pelena area of Weligama, Matara, on December 31, 2023. Following this, the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) was instructed to arrest and present the eight individuals, including Deshabandu Tennakoon, before the court. On March 17, the Court of Appeal dismissed the writ petition filed by Tennakoon, in which he sought an interim injunction to prevent the execution of the arrest order issued by the Matara Magistrates Court in connection with the shooting incident. The Court of Appeal subsequently directed the CID to take immediate steps to arrest Tennakoon and present him before the court. Meanwhile, the motion filed by a group of MPs for the removal of Tennakoon from the post of IGP is scheduled to be tabled in the Parliament on April 08 (Tuesday).",

Union Minister for External Affairs Jaishankar has said in March that 97 fishermen are still in prison. In 2024 alone, more than 500 fishermen were arrested, which translates to two arrests per day, he said. Stalin called on the Union Government to take action. Union Government should stop this and create a permanent solution. On behalf of the Tamil Nadu government, I have written 74 letters addressing PM Narendra Modi and EAM. Every time I meet the PM, I raise the issue. Retrieving Katchatheevu is the only solution, he added. What is the Katchatheevu Row? Katchatheevu is a small island in the Palk Strait between India and Sri Lanka. It was given to Sri Lanka in 1974 under an agreement between the two countries. The issue remains controversial because Tamil Nadu fishermen often get arrested by the Sri Lankan Navy when they fish near the island. Many political parties in Tamil Nadu demand that the island be taken back to protect the rights of local fishermen. Opposition criticises DMK Leader of Opposition Edappadi Palaniswami criticised the ruling DMK party for its handling of the Katchatheevu issue. He reminded the Assembly that Katchatheevu was once part of Ramanathapuram Samasthanam until 1948 and was handed over to Sri Lanka in 1974 when the Congress was in power at the Centre and the DMK ruled Tamil Nadu. Palaniswami said, Our fishermen are in danger. He mentioned that former CM J Jayalalithaa took legal action by filing a case in the Supreme Court in 2008 and passed a resolution in 2009 for retrieving the island, but the issue remained unresolved. He pointed out a Supreme Court ruling that without the approval of Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha, no land can be given to any country, and stated that the matter is still pending in court. The AIADMK leader questioned the DMKs role in the central government, asking, When DMK was in power in the central government for 16 years, why was this matter not raised? Why didnt they take any steps to retrieve Katchatheevu? He accused the DMK of using the issue for political gain. Today they (DMK) have taken this resolution because they want to play electoral politics. Just one year left for the TN Assembly Election 2026, so they have taken this issue into their hands, he claimed. DMK is doing drama by taking this issue in their hands ahead of the elections. The resolution has now been passed in the Tamil Nadu Assembly, and the demand for Katchatheevus retrieval has been officially placed before the Union Government.

        "date": "April 3, 2025 02:54 pm",
        "content": "Extreme heat and heavy rain in Myanmar could cause disease outbreaks among earthquake survivors camping in the open, global aid bodies warned on Thursday, complicating rescue efforts made difficult by a civil war, as the death toll surpassed 3,000. Last Fridays 7.7-magnitude quake, one of Myanmars strongest in a century, jolted a region home to 28 million, toppling buildings such as hospitals, flattening communities and leaving many without food, water and shelter. Deaths rose to 3,085 on Thursday, with 4,715 injured and 341 missing, the ruling junta said. The World Health Organization flagged a rising risk of cholera and other diseases in the worst-affected areas, such as Mandalay, Sagaing and the capital of Naypyitaw, while it prepared 1 million of relief supplies, including body bags. Cholera remains a particular concern for all of us, said Elena Vuolo, the deputy head of its Myanmar office, pointing to an outbreak last year in Mandalay. The risk was worsened by damage to about half of healthcare facilities in the quake-hit areas, including hospitals destroyed by the quake in Mandalay and Naypyitaw, she added. People were camping outdoors in temperatures of 38C (100F) because they were too scared to go home, and many hospitals were also setting up temporary facilities there, Vuolo told Reuters from Naypyitaw. Skin disease, malaria and dengue were among the diseases that could result from prolonged crises, such as in Myanmar, she said. But conditions could get even tougher for the huge relief effort, after weather officials warned that unseasonal rain from Sunday to April 11 could threaten the areas hardest-hit by the quake. Ive heard that in the next day or two there are rains (expected), Titon Mitra, the Myanmar representative of the United Nations Development Programme told Reuters by telephone, during a visit to Sagaing. If that hits, weve got people, lots of people now, in temporary shelters, makeshift camps out on the streets, and thats going to be a real problem, he said, also flagging the UNs concerns about an outbreak of waterborne disease. Despite the devastation, junta chief Min Aung Hlaing will leave his disaster-stricken country on Thursday for a rare trip to a regional summit in Bangkok, state television said. It is an uncommon foreign visit for a general regarded as a pariah by many countries and the subject of Western sanctions and an International Criminal Court investigation. Ceasefire The weather extremes will add to the challenges faced by aid and rescue groups, which have called for access to all affected areas despite the strife of civil war. The military has struggled to run Myanmar since its return to power in a 2021 coup that unseated the elected civilian government of Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi. The generals have been internationally isolated since the takeover and Myanmars economy and basic services, including healthcare, have been reduced to tatters amid the strife. On Wednesday state-run MRTV said a unilateral government ceasefire would take immediate effect for 20 days, to support relief efforts after the quake, but warned authorities would respond accordingly if rebels launched attacks. The move came after a major rebel alliance declared a ceasefire on Tuesday to assist the humanitarian effort. Nearly a week after the quake, searchers in neighbouring Thailand hunting for survivors combed a mountain of debris left after a skyscraper in the capital, Bangkok, collapsed while under construction. Rescuers are using mechanical diggers and bulldozers to break up 100 tons of concrete to locate any still alive after the disaster that killed 15 people, with 72 still missing. Thailands nationwide toll stands at 22. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

The prime minister made these remarks while addressing the International Expert Conference on An Integrated and Sustainable Approach to Safeguarding the World Heritage Property of the Sacred City of Anuradhapura in Sri Lanka, which was convened at UNESCO headquarters in Paris. The summit representing the partnership between UNESCO and Sri Lanka, brought together international experts in discussing sustainable strategies for conserving Anuradhapura, a UNESCO World Heritage site with significant cultural and historical value, according to the Prime Ministers Office. Prime Minister Dr. Harini Amarasuriya further elaborated: I consider it a special privilege to have this opportunity to visit UNESCO when Sri Lanka is celebrating the 75th anniversary of its partnership with the organization. We celebrated last July with a productive visit to Sri Lanka by the Director-General of UNESCO, Audrey Azoulay, and its culminating today in Paris with the convening of this expert conference on Anuradhapura, one of the most revered heritage sites and cultural treasures in the world. This conference provides us with a unique opportunity to reflect upon aspects of Sri Lankas long-standing collaboration with UNESCO, a partnership that has reinforced and enriched our shared vision of advancing intercultural dialogue, heritage conservation, education, sustainable development, and technological progress. In this backdrop, where it requires ensuring the preservation of cultural heritage for future generations, UNESCOs role as a global leader is more relevant than ever. This timely initiative, gathering the worlds experts on heritage conservation, provides a critical platform for dialogue, knowledge sharing, technical collaboration, and resource mobilization, thus reinforcing our collective responsibility to protect and sustain this invaluable cultural legacy for future generations. In Sri Lanka, the ancient kingdoms of Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa stand at heritage sites located in the cultural triangle conserved with the support of UNESCO since the 1980s which goes back to the long-standing partnership. We also be very conscious that heritage, history and archeology has been weaponized in the past by resists group to divide our people for narrow political games. The government rejects racism and thriving to acknowledge and celebrate the diversity of cultures and traditions of Sri Lanka and bring people together. Further, the prime Minister stated that the government plans to develop three cities, Anuradhapura, Jaffna, and Kandy as heritage cities in Sri Lanka, the statement said. Prime Minister Dr. Harini Amarasuriya also conveyed deep condolences of Sri Lanka to the government and people of Myanmar and Thailand.

Furthermore, the Opposition Leader called on Sri Lanka to have a strategic reset by embracing partnerships over paranoia, stop the hate-mongering for the sake of appeasing some local cartels, build an Asia-centric trade strategy with India, ASEAN and Bangladesh, and to shift from tariffs to production-led, investor-friendly growth. And above all, we must stop the silent defiance of regional interests of other nations. Protecting mutual interests is the only way forward. Posturing is not strategy. Mature nations negotiate. Its time we did too, Premadasa noted. On Wednesday, US President Donald Trump announced a sweeping set of reciprocal tariffs, imposing a baseline 10 tax on all imports and significantly higher rates on dozens of countries with which the US runs trade deficits. As a result, Sri Lanka now faces the 6th highest tariff rates in the world44, a sharp increase from the previous 12.2 tariff rate.",

MP Dilith Jayaweera noted that Sri Lankas failure to anticipate US President Trumps 44 reciprocal tax is a self-inflicted wound. Issuing a statement on X (formerly Twitter), the parliamentarian stressed that short-sighted politics is steering Sri Lanka back towards bankruptcy. He added, With the U.S. buying 23 of our exports (2.9B in 2024), key industriesapparel (1.92B), rubber (330M) (for which U.S. is our largest individual buyer), tea, seafood, gems  moreare at grave risk. Sri Lanka is one of the countries facing the highest Trump-era tariffs. Meanwhile, earlier today, President Anura Kumara Dissanayake appointed a high-level committee to review the potential economic impact of the newly imposed reciprocal tariffs by the US President and to provide recommendations to the government. The committee comprises key economic policymakers and industry experts, including the Secretary to the Ministry of Finance, the Governor of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka, the Chairman of the Board of Investment (BOI), the Chairman of the Export Development Board (EDB), and the Director General of Economic Affairs at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Additionally, Senior Economic Advisor to the President Duminda Hulangamuwa, Chief Economic Policy Advisor of the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce Shiran Fernando, and prominent business figures Ashroff Omar, Sharad Amalean, and Saif Jafferjee have been named in the committee. This initiative aims to assess challenges arising from the US tariff adjustments and propose strategic measures to mitigate any adverse effects on Sri Lankas economy and trade. The committee is expected to submit its findings and recommendations to the government in the coming weeks. US President Donald Trump on Wednesday announced a sweeping set of reciprocal tariffs, imposing a baseline 10 per cent tax on all imports and significantly higher rates on dozens of countries with which the US runs trade deficits. The sweeping duties, which drew bewildered condemnation from many long-standing U.S. allies who found themselves tagged with unexpectedly high tariff rates, promise to erect new barriers around the worlds largest consumer economy, reversing decades of trade liberalization that have shaped the global order. In a statement delivered from the White House Rose Garden, Trump described the measure as a declaration of economic independence and vowed to boost domestic production by levelling the playing field with foreign competitors. Trading partners are expected to respond with countermeasures of their own that could lead to dramatically higher prices for everything from bicycles to wine. Earlier, U.S. stock futures dropped sharply after the announcement, following weeks of volatile trading as investors speculated about how the incoming tariffs might affect the global economy, inflation and corporate earnings. U.S. stocks have erased nearly 5 trillion of value since mid-February. The new tariff structure introduces a 10 per cent flat rate on all imports and applies higher rates to several major trading partners. At 49 per cent, Cambodia faces the steepest tariff, followed closely by Vietnam at 46 per cent, Sri Lanka at 44 per cent, and China at 34 per cent. Trump also announced a 26 per cent discounted reciprocal tariff on imports from India. Sri Lanka faces the sixth highest tariff rates in the world, while currently 25 of the countrys total exports go to the US. The reciprocal tariffs, Trump said, were a response to duties and other non-tariff barriers put on U.S. goods. He argued that the new levies will boost manufacturing jobs at home. Outside economists have warned that tariffs could slow the global economy, raise the risk of recession, and increase living costs for the average U.S. family by thousands of dollars. --With Agencies Inputs",

Issuing a clarification on the 44 trade tariffs imposed on Sri Lanka as part of US President Donald Trumps decision to impose reciprocal tariffs with a baseline 10 tax on all imports and significantly higher rates on dozens of countries, the Minister stated that the government had prior knowledge of the situation, but awaited the US policy decision before taking action. We were aware of the situationbut a country cannot go into another country and pressure their policy decisions before they are enacted. This is their common policy, now we have to discuss and take decisions on its negative impact on us, Dr. Fernando added. We have already held a few rounds of internal talks on what happened. These tariffs will come into effect on April 09. Were hopeful of negotiating and receiving a possible reduction of the tariffs through discussions, he noted. Furthermore, the Minister stated that Sri Lankan government is hopeful of receiving a reduction of these new tariffs, since the country is moving forward with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and is still in a state of recovery. We are in a special position right now. Although Sri Lanka has a beneficial trade deficit, the country is moving forward tied with a programme of the International Monetary Fund. The country is in a state of re-building, and is in a hard position...still in the process of stabilizing. So, we have space to explain this situation. This explanation will have to align with their United States policy as well. The Minister also highlighted possible negative impact on Sri Lanka through the new trade tariffs, explaining that the textile and food exports will possibly be hit and that the countrys export revenue will go down. Commenting further, the Deputy Minister of Economic Development said that if Sri Lanka fails to receive a positive outcome through the negotiations, the government is confident of moving forward with other options. If we fail to negotiate, as US is following a common policy for the whole world, we have other optionsAs an example, we have the opportunity to discuss a special benefit through the GSP tariff system.

        "date": "April 3, 2025 06:53 pm",
        "content": "Sri Lankan animal rights activists marched on Thursday to protest the round-up of stray dogs a day ahead of a visit by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Authorities in Colombo and the Buddhist pilgrim city of Anuradhapura have reportedly deployed dog catchers to impound hounds ahead of Modis visit, which begins on Friday. Many of Colombos strays are beloved by their adopted neighbourhoods despite lacking formal owners -- and are dubbed community canines rather than street dogs. Around a dozen protesters from the Rally for Animal Rights and Environment (RARE) waved placards outside President Anura Kumara Dissanayakes office in Colombo after submitting a petition to Indias high commission. Stop the cruel removal of our community dogs, one placard read. Protesters said that many of the dogs in public parks had been vaccinated and neutered and were cared for by locals and animal welfare groups. How can Sri Lanka promote tourism when we are a country known for animal cruelty? another placard read. Protesters urged New Delhis intervention to prevent the cruel and unnecessary removal of these dogs, saying that the round-up of dogs would create displacement, suffering, and potential harm. Modi is set to receive an official welcome at Colombos Independence Square, where dog catchers are reported to have been busy in this week. He is also set to visit Anuradhapura to pay homage to the Jaya Sri Maha Bodhi Tree, a sacred bo tree grown from a cutting brought from the holy Bodhi tree in Bodh Gaya, India.

        "content": "The Ceylon Chamber of Commerce (CCC) today expresses deep concern over the imposition of a 44 tariff on Sri Lankan exports to the United States. US President Donald Trump announced sweeping tariffs yesterday on major trade partners, including China and the European Union. With the US accounting for approximately USD 3 billion in exports and 25 of Sri Lankas total merchandise export, this development poses a significant challenge to the countrys trade and economic stability, the chamber said in a statement. Additionally, broader global trade disruptions could slow economic growth, affecting overall demand in key export markets such as the US and the EU, it warned. The CCC said it appreciates the President of Sri Lanka setting up a committee to evaluate the impact of the US tariffs and provide solutions to mitigate potential risks to the export sector. Since we are halfway through the IMF Extended Fund Facility programme and navigating a tight fiscal space, it is vital that Sri Lanka is able to negotiate down from the high tariff band. The Ceylon Chamber said it is an opportune moment for the Government to relook at its tariff structure and implement measures that will improve trade facilitation and improve the ease of doing business. The Ceylon Chamber said it remains committed to working closely with the Government to develop a coordinated and strategic response to mitigate the potential economic impact of these tariffs. We urge all stakeholders to collaborate in ensuring that Sri Lankas trade interests are safeguarded, while actively pursuing diplomatic and policy-driven solutions to sustain and strengthen its export sector, the statement added.",

        "title": "Family of Sri Lankan woman who died in Japan detention demand release of full footage",
        "date": "April 4, 2025 06:52 am",
        "content": "The family of a Sri Lankan woman who died in a detention centre in Japan in 2021 is planning to file a lawsuit to demand that Japanese authorities release hundreds of hours of security footage of her last days to help determine the cause of her death. The case involving Wishma Sandamali, who was 33 years old when she died on March 6, 2021, has intensified scrutiny of Japans immigration detention system. Rights groups have called for greater transparency and an end to prolonged and opaque detentions of foreigners under investigation by local immigration authorities. Nagoyas immigration agency has confirmed it possesses around 295 hours of video footage of Sandamali while she was in detention for overstaying her visa. However, the agency has only agreed to release five hours of recordings to her family. Sandamalis family has already filed a suit demanding compensation from the Japanese government for her death, claiming that she died because immigration authorities failed to provide her with medical care when she became unwell. The government has defended the actions of the officials at the detention centre and claimed that medical examinations found no reasons for Sandamalis poor health. Her family believes the footage that has been being withheld may shed light on the circumstances leading to her death. A segment of the footage that has been provided to the family shows her falling to the floor from her bunk and pleading with two staff for help, the familys Japanese lawyers have said. Left untreated, she died a few hours later, the lawyers added. Through their Japanese lawyers, Sandamalis family members asked in February that they be allowed to view all the footage in which she appears. Nagoyas detention bureau has rejected their request, saying the footage could reveal security systems in the detention centre and that releasing it could undermine the maintenance of order, national broadcaster NHK reported. The family is taking further legal action on the grounds that the footage could be vital in determining how Sandamali died and has described the agencys decision as unacceptable. Teppei Kasai, an official with Human Rights Watch in Japan, said the government must responsibly handle Sandamalis case and others like it. The authorities have a responsibility to ensure that her death in detention is investigated and to be transparent, he told This Week in Asia. Releasing all the available footage is one step towards securing that transparency. If the detention bureau and the government were concerned that releasing the footage in a courtroom could lead to security breaches, it should be shown fully to Sandamalis family in a secure and private location to address the security concerns while demonstrating transparency to the family, he added. Kasai also said the case should be used to highlight the prolonged detention that immigrants and asylum seekers were often forced to endure in Japan. Sandamali arrived in Japan in 2017 on a student visa but later dropped out of her language school. She was taken into custody in August 2020 for overstaying her visa and held at the Nagoya detention facility. In January 2021, she began reporting health problems, including vomiting and dizziness, and lost more than 20kg before her death in March. The bottom line is that she should not have been detained for that long in the first place, Kasai said. And this is something that United Nations human rights experts expressed concern about when Japan reformed its immigration and refugee law two years ago. By detaining Sandamali for such a long time, the Japanese government was putting her at risk. The core issue here is the unnecessary prolonged detention of asylum seekers in Japan, he added. However, the case has also led to criticisms against overstayers in Japan and Sandamalis family. One message linked to a Jiji Press story on the case read: How much longer are you going to keep making a fuss about this? Another said: First and foremost, all illegal immigrants should be deported immediately and banned from re-entering the country. They are trying to squeeze money out of Japan at all costs. Despite the criticisms, Kasai said studies had shown that most Japanese were in favour of Japan accepting foreigners who were in the country legally. The people who go on those sites and write these things are the noisy minority. While that is a problem, it really does not reflect the feelings of the silent majority here, he added.

        "content": "Energy Analyst Dr. Vidhura Ralapanawe says Sri Lankas local energy developers are being offered unfavourable terms for renewable energy projects compared to foreign investors. He made this statement while speaking at a press conference convened by the National Chamber of Commerce on Thursday (03). If you look at Siyambalanduwa project or Mannar wind project, what they say is developers account for up to 5 uncompensated curtailment and beyond that if the CEB (Ceylon Electricity Board) curtails, it has to be compensated at the same rate. People who bid for that, they account for this 5 curtailment, he noted. The problem is this feed-in tariff uses equation. This equation assumes 100 of the power generated will be taken by the CEB. If they wanted, they could put the same 5 curtailment in the contract and they should have added that in to the equation. Then the contract becomes bankable. Furthermore, Dr. Ralapanawe argued that excess curtailment will cause developers to operate at a loss, stating, in some years, they are projecting 23 of the energy will be curtailed from renewable energy. So, we are running at a loss. People who keep tariffs low are given bad conditions while people who sign contracts in dollar terms and fossil fuel contracts are given favourable terms, he added.",

        "content": "South Koreas Constitutional Court on Friday (Apr 4) decided to oust President Yoon Suk Yeol, upholding parliaments impeachment motion over his short-lived imposition of martial law last year that sparked the countrys worst political crisis in decades. We hereby pronounce the following ruling, with the unanimous agreement of all Justices. (We) dismiss respondent President Yoon Suk Yeol, acting chief justice Moon Hyung-bae said. With Yoons ouster, a presidential election is required to take place within 60 days, according to the countrys constitution. Prime Minister Han Duck-soo will continue to serve as acting president until the new president is inaugurated. The ruling caps months of political turmoil that have overshadowed efforts to deal with the new administration of US President Donald Trump at a time of slowing growth. Separately, 64-year-old Yoon faces a criminal trial on insurrection charges. The embattled leader became the first sitting South Korean president to be arrested on Jan 15 but was released in March after a court cancelled his arrest warrant. The crisis was triggered by Yoons Dec 3 declaration of martial law, which he has said was needed to root out anti-state elements and the opposition Democratic Partys alleged abuse of its parliamentary majority that he said was destroying the country. Yoon lifted the decree six hours later after lawmakers defied efforts by the security forces to seal off parliament and voted to reject it. Yoon has said he never intended to fully impose emergency military rule and tried to downplay the fallout, saying nobody was hurt. Months of protests have followed, and it remained unclear if the political chaos sparked by Yoons martial law declaration would now be eased by the court ruling. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "content": "The government must provide urgent relief to exporters on the backdrop of the reciprocal tariffs imposed by United States President Donald Trump, according to the Chairman of the Committee on Public Finance, Parliamentarian Harsha de Silva. MP de Silva while acknowledging the complexities that could arise following the announcement urged the government to introduce urgent relief measures until the matter is resolved. He also urged the government to suspend next weeks scheduled amendment of the Simplified Value Added Tax (SVAT) removal for exporters. Despite being a key figure of the opposition, MP Harsha de Silva offered to help the incumbent government led by President Anura Kumara Dissanayake to help figure out a way forward. On Wednesday, US President Donald Trump announced a sweeping set of reciprocal tariffs, imposing a baseline 10 per cent tax on all imports and significantly higher rates on dozens of countries with which the US runs trade deficits. Sri Lanka is facing one of the steepest tariffs among countries amounting 44 per cent. Following the announcement, President Anura Kumara Dissanayake appointed a committee to conduct an in-depth study on potential issues that may arise due to the new reciprocal tariff system and to submit recommendations to the government. The committee comprises key economic policymakers and industry experts, including the Secretary to the Ministry of Finance, the Governor of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka, the Chairman of the Board of Investment (BOI), the Chairman of the Export Development Board (EDB), and the Director General of Economic Affairs at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Additionally, Senior Economic Advisor to the President Duminda Hulangamuwa, Chief Economic Policy Advisor of the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce Shiran Fernando, and business figures Ashroff Omar, Sharad Amalean, and Saif Jafferjee have also been appointed to the committee. The Presidents Media Division said the initiative aims to assess challenges arising from the US tariff adjustments and propose strategic measures to mitigate any adverse effects on Sri Lankas economy and trade. The committee is expected to submit its findings and recommendations to the government in the coming weeks. Moreover, Minister of Labour and Deputy Minister of Economic Development Dr. Anil Jayantha Fernando said Sri Lanka will hold talks and negotiate the new trade tariffs imposed by the United States on the countrys exports before April 09. Issuing a clarification on the 44 per cent trade tariffs imposed on Sri Lanka as part of US President Donald Trumps decision to impose reciprocal tariffs with a baseline 10 per cent tax on all imports and significantly higher rates on dozens of countries, the Minister stated that the government had prior knowledge of the situation, but awaited the US policy decision before taking action.",

        "date": "April 4, 2025 11:25 am",
        "content": "Apples next iPhone is expected to be a significant upgrade over more than six generations, bringing a design overhaul. Reports are rife that the iPhone 17 will feature a new camera design, thinner and smoother displays, and better software capabilities for photography, navigation, and artificial intelligence. As anticipation for the next iPhone model grows, here is a list of five major changes users might see in the iPhone 17. Dual-material design According to Bloombergs Mark Gurman, Apple is looking at a combination of metal and glass on the next iPhone instead of using plain glass like before. The iPhone 17 may use a sturdier titanium alloy frame, while its back may use metal around the camera bump for better durability. The redesigned chassis may also allow Apple to move away from the current boxy edges. Apple is also expected to use an Ultra-Thin Glass (UTG) display to make the iPhone 17 sleeker. Faster performance The next iPhone may use an A19 chip, built using TSMCs 2nm process for faster performance and better power efficiency. However, reports also suggest that these improvements will be incremental, so while the changes may not be discernible, they could improve the battery life. The new chip could also handle advanced AI features. Apple is also expected to upgrade the cooling mechanism of the next iPhone, making heat dissipation faster. Improved cameras While the Pro models of the next iPhone series could feature a camera bump, the standard iPhone 17 may continue to use a 48MP main sensor. The ultrawide camera, however, may be upgraded from 12MP to 48MP for crisper ultrawide shots. Reports suggest Apple could improve Portrait Mode and Night Mode on the next iPhone models. Apple may also switch to a 24MP camera on the front for clearer selfies and video calls. ProMotion displays For the first time, the non-Pro models may have a 120Hz refresh rate. According to reports, Apple may equip the iPhone 17 with a ProMotion display with adaptive refresh rates. However, the display may use a MicroLED panel instead of OLED to minimise costs. This panel may offer better contrast, consume less power, and avoid burn-in issues. Battery upgrades The new chip on the iPhone 17 could allow longer battery life, while the improved thermal management system could reduce heating on the device. The MagSafe connectivity on the iPhone 17 may also be improved, per reports. Source: Republic World --Agencies",

Indian High Commissioner Santosh Jha has also described Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modis visit to the country as significant, stating that it would add a new agenda to the bilateral relationship. Indian Prime Minister Modi is scheduled to arrive in Colombo later this evening on a three-day official visit. Prime Minister Modis visit comes at the invitation of President Anura Kumara Dissanayake, who visited India in December last year as his maiden foreign visit after assuming office. PM Modi will be accompanied by Indias External Affairs Minister, S. Jaishankar. The official welcoming ceremony is scheduled to take place tomorrow (05) at Independence Square in Colombo. Speaking regarding the visit, High Commissioner Jha has told ANI, It is a very important visit. Our relationship today is on an upswing, and Prime Minister Modi will be coming as the first foreign guest under the new government. You would recall that last year, in December, President Dissanayake visited India as his first foreign destination. So, this is a very, very important visit. We are essentially looking at taking forward existing understandings and adding a new agenda to the relationship. Discussing bilateral ties and expected outcomes, the Indian envoy said, We are looking at a very wide-ranging agenda. When President Dissanayake visited Delhi, the Prime Minister highlighted three pillars of our partnership: connectivity, energy, and digitisation. We will have agreements in these areas. There will also be some agreements in the health sector, and we are working on a framework MoU in defence cooperation. He further noted that relations between the two nations are in very good shape. Prime Minister Modi will have official engagements in Colombo tomorrow (05) while he will visit Anuradhapura on Sunday (06). --With inputs from agencies",

        "date": "April 4, 2025 04:09 pm",
        "content": "Major U.S. stock indexes registered their biggest daily percentage drops since 2020 on Thursday and the dollar weakened as U.S. President Donald Trumps drastic trade tariffs stoked fears of a global recession and led investors to seek safe-haven assets like bonds and the yen. SP 500 companies lost a combined 2.4 trillion in stock market value, their biggest one-day loss since the coronavirus pandemic hit global markets on March 16, 2020. The Nasdaq Composite Index led declines on Wall Street, ending the day down 5.97 in its biggest daily fall since March 2020, while the SP 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average posted their biggest daily percentage declines since June 2020. Traders were rattled by the severity of a new baseline 10 tariff on imported goods and some eye-watering reciprocal tariffs on dozens of countries that Trump said had unfair trade barriers. Investors fear a full-blown trade dispute could trigger a sharp global economic slowdown and drive up inflation, with the latest round of U.S. trade tariffs hitting a world economy barely recovered from the post-pandemic inflation surge and dealing with geopolitical strife. Markets plummeted today, and I kind of view it as a near-complete reset of what investors are thinking going forward, said Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel in Charlottesville, Virginia. Any expectation for revenues and earnings for most companies in the U.S. - and globally for that matter - are going to be lowered. The market is reflecting reduced growth, reduced earnings, reduced revenue. Shares of Apple fell 9.2, hit by the tariffs on China, the base for much of its manufacturing. Amazon.com dropped 9, Microsoft fell 2.4, and Nvidia declined 7.8. The SP 500 technology index fell 6.9. The SP 500 energy sector sank 7.5, with oil prices falling more than 6 on the day. The CBOE Volatility index, known as Wall Streets fear gauge, rose to 30.02, its highest closing level since August 5, 2024. The Dow fell 1,679.39 points, or 3.98, to 40,545.93, the SP 500 dropped 274.45 points, or 4.84, to 5,396.52 and the Nasdaq Composite sank 1,050.44 points, or 5.97, to 16,550.61. MSCIs gauge of stocks across the globe fell 28.47 points, or 3.41, to 807.64, set for its biggest daily percentage fall since June 2022. The U.S. dollar also weakened sharply. The euro hit a six-month high against the dollar and was last up 1.74 at 1.1037 , while the dollar fell 1.95 against the Japanese yen to 146.445 yen , and sank 2.35 on the Swiss franc to 0.8608 franc . In Europe, the 27-country EU bloc now faces a 20 reciprocal levy. The pan-European STOXX 600 index fell 2.57. Trumps levies impacted Asia particularly hard. China was hit with a 34 reciprocal tariff, Japan 24, South Korea 25 and Vietnam 46. This is how you sabotage the worlds economic engine while claiming to supercharge it, said Nigel Green, CEO of global financial advisory deVere Group. The scramble for ultra-safe government bonds that provide a guaranteed income drove down U.S. Treasury yields. The benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury note yield tumbled 14.6 basis points to 4.049 after falling to a 4.004, its lowest since November 25. The yield on the note was on track for its biggest daily drop since August 2. Euro area government bond yields dropped, with Germanys 10-year yield, the euro areas benchmark, hitting its lowest since March 4. If the tariffs trigger recessions, central banks around the world are likely to slash interest rates, which benefit bonds. Credit rating agency Fitch warned they were a game-changer for the U.S. and global economy, while Deutsche Bank called them a once in a lifetime moment that could knock 1-1.5 off U.S. growth this year. Oil prices dropped after OPEC agreed to a surprise increase in output, the day after Trump announced his new tariffs. Brent futures settled at 70.14 a barrel, down 4.81, or 6.42. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures finished at 66.95 a barrel, down 4.76, or 6.64. Gold hit a record high above 3,160 an ounce before running out of steam. Spot gold was last down 0.85 at 3,106.99 an ounce. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "date": "April 4, 2025 04:20 pm",
        "content": "A significant misuse has occurred in issuing permits for the importation of fully electric vehicles to Sri Lankans employed abroad, based on foreign remittances, the Committee on Public Accounts (COPA) has revealed. The matter was disclosed during a COPA meeting, chaired by Member of Parliament Aravinda Senarath, to discuss the special audit reports compiled regarding the scheme implemented between May 01, 2022, and September 15, 2023, to grant permits for the importation of fully electric vehicles for Sri Lankans employed abroad, based on foreign remittances. The statement issued by the Department of Communications of Parliament noted that during the meeting, the Auditor General pointed out that there are concerns that the scheme has been used for money laundering. He indicated that these suspicions emerged upon examining the entire procedure carried out in this regard. The Auditor General had further revealed that 1,077 vehicle permits were issued during this period, of which 77 permits were later canceled, and that two main institutions had operated as importers providing facilities for 640 permit holders. The Auditor General emphasized that this indicates the creation of a business under the pretext of permit issuance. Moreover, due to the increase of the luxury tax exemption threshold from Rs. 6 million to Rs. 12 million for 921 vehicles imported until September 30, 2024, the Auditor General stated that the government lost tax revenue amounting to Rs. 2.42 billion. It was also revealed that four individuals who had not traveled abroad during the relevant period were issued electric vehicle permits. The statement added that since the circular for the scheme did not specify a minimum duration of overseas employment required to be eligible for an electric vehicle permit, individuals who had been overseas for short periods ranging from three days to three months, as well as those who had traveled abroad intermittently, had been granted permits. Accordingly, COPA recommended that an internal investigation be conducted and a report be submitted within a month, and that disciplinary action be taken against the officials involved in these irregularities, the statement added.",

        "date": "April 4, 2025 04:51 pm",
        "content": "The National New Paddy Harvest Festival (Aluth Sahal Mangalya), a traditional annual ceremony of offering the first portion of the freshly harvested Maha season paddy to the sacred Sri Maha Bodhi, was held this morning (04) under the patronage of President Anura Kumara Dissanayake at the historic Sri Maha Bodhi premises in Anuradhapura. The 58th edition of the National New Paddy Harvest Festival was organized by the Ministry of Agriculture and the Department of Agrarian Services under the theme In unison, let us cultivate the land, to build a self-sufficient nation, following the guidance of the Atamasthanadhipathi, the Most Venerable Pallegama Hemarathana Nayaka Thera. This ritual, which dates back to the era of ancient monarchs, saw the participation of farmers from across the country. In accordance with tradition, they prayed for timely rains and fertile fields and invoked blessings for a self-sufficient and prosperous economy through agriculture. President Anura Kumara Disanayake first paid homage and received blessings from the sacred Jaya Sri Maha Bodhi before joining the ceremonial proceedings, according to the Presidents Media Division (PMD). The sacred procession, which carried the newly harvested paddy from near the historic Sinha Kanuwa in Anuradhapura, arrived at the sandy courtyard of the Sri Maha Bodhi, marking the ceremonial commencement of the New Paddy Harvest Festival. The Most Venerable Pallegama Hemarathana Nayaka Thera commenced the ritual by filling the golden bowl with the new paddy, after which representatives from all provinces added paddy from their respective regions, symbolically filling the golden bowl. President Anura Kumara Disanayake also participated in this ritualistic moment, amidst the chanting of Pirith by the Maha Sangha, the PMD reported. A vessel of pure bees honey, traditionally offered to the Sri Maha Bodhi, was ceremonially presented to the President by Deputy Leader of the Vedda Community W.U. Bandiyala Aththo. The vessel of ghee, brought from the historic Saman Devalaya in Sabaragamuwa, was also presented to President Anura Kumara Disanayake, to be used in the customary ghee offering at the Sri Maha Bodhi. The President also received the commemorative plaque of the 58th National New Paddy Harvest Festival and presented tokens of appreciation to farmer leaders who have made significant contributions to the development of the countrys agriculture sector, the statement stated. As part of the initiative to secure a pest-free harvest, the President participated in the distribution of pest-resistant seed paddy to farming communities across the provinces. Addressing the subsequent official ceremony, President Anura Kumara Disanayake stated that the current government is working to transform an economy that was in disarray. He noted that the Paddy Marketing Board is burdened with a debt of Rs. 28 billion, while harvested paddy is being left to spoil in storage. The President emphasized that the current administration has accepted the responsibility of restoring and restructuring this disordered system. He added that the government expects the support not only of the state machinery related to agriculture but also of all farming communities. He affirmed the intention to integrate Sri Lankas cultural and traditional systems to reclaim the legacy of the agricultural economy and thereby strengthen the national economy. President Disanayake further stated that the countrys ancient kings achieved greatness through their contributions to agriculture and irrigation and that self-sufficiency in food was a critical factor in that success. He highlighted that sustainable development has become a global discourse today and that Sri Lankas Tank Cascade System or Vapi System, stands as a remarkable example of sustainable development. The countrys irrigation system, which dates back nearly 2,000 years, continues to contribute to the advancement of agriculture even today, it added. As such, the government has allocated Rs. 2 billion in the current budget to rehabilitate the irrigation system and renovation work on the North Central Maha Ela Project has already commenced to revitalize the countrys agricultural industry. He added that the government also plans to develop seed farms to produce self-sufficient seeds, while protecting genetic ownership. He further emphasized the need for fair prices for agricultural produce, both for farmers and consumers. Due to long-standing market distortions, the government will intervene over the next two to three harvesting seasons to ensure both parties receive fair prices. The President also stated that the necessary provisions for such state interventions have been made in the current budget. Steps have been taken to create storage capacity to hold 300,000 metric tons of paddy, which is expected to mitigate market distortions going forward. Among those present at the occasion were the Chief Incumbent of the Ruwanweliseya and Chancellor of the Rajarata University, Most Venerable Ithalawetunuwewe Gnanatillake Thera, the Chief Incumbent of the Lankaramaya, Most Venerable Ralapanawa Dhammajothi Thera and members of the clergy; Minister of Agriculture, Livestock, Lands and Irrigation K.D.

Chinas aggressive countermove to U.S. tariffs all but confirms we are heading towards a global trade war; a war that has no winners and which will hurt economic growth and demand for key commodities such as crude oil and refined products, said Ole Hansen, head of commodity strategy at Saxo Bank. Fuelling the oil sell-off was a decision by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, known collectively as OPEC, to advance plans for output increases, with the group now aiming to return 411,000 barrels per day (bpd) to the market in May, up from the previously planned 135,000 bpd.

The timing is frankly amazing, Evans said. Imports of oil, gas and refined products were given exemptions from Trumps sweeping new tariffs, but the policies could stoke inflation, slow economic growth and intensify trade disputes, weighing on oil prices. Goldman Sachs analysts responded with sharp cuts to their December 2025 targets for Brent and WTI by 5 each to 66 and 62 respectively. The risks to our reduced oil price forecast are to the downside, especially for 2026, given growing risks of recession and to a lesser extent of higher OPEC supply, the banks head of oil research, Daan Struyven, said in a note.

        "date": "April 4, 2025 09:26 pm",
        "content": "The Government of Sri Lanka says it stands ready to engage with the US administration at the earliest opportunity to explore ways to manage the trade balance in a fair manner and that it is committed to substantially reducing tariff and non-tariff barriers that hinder trade and investment. On Wednesday, US President Donald Trump announced a sweeping set of reciprocal tariffs, imposing a baseline 10 per cent tax on all imports and significantly higher rates on dozens of countries with which the US runs trade deficits. Sri Lanka is facing one of the steepest tariffs among countries amounting 44 per cent. The Government of Sri Lanka said it recognizes the evolving trade landscape with the United States looking to address trade imbalances through reciprocal tariffs. This tariff is set at 44 which is significant as Sri Lanka exports USD 3 billion to the US, Sri Lankas Finance Ministry said, issuing a statement to clarify the governments stance on the tariffs. The Government reaffirmed its strong commitment to deepening economic ties with the US, a longstanding friend and trusted trading partner. Sri Lanka is engaged in an IMF Extended Fund Facility since March 2023 as part of its recovery from the unprecedented economic crisis and successfully completed the Third review of the programme. In this context, Sri Lanka said it appreciates the steadfast support extended by the US in supporting Sri Lankas economic recovery, in particular the support in the external debt restructuring efforts. We have now stabilized our economy and on a steady growth path of 5 in 2024. Considering our export exposure and potential slowdown in global demand, we are concerned that our recovery path could be constrained, the statement said. The Government stands ready to engage with the US administration at the earliest opportunity to explore ways to manage the trade balance in a fair manner. We are committed to substantially reduce tariff and non-tariff barriers that hinder trade and investment, the Finance Ministry said. Improving the ease of doing business remains a top priority of the Government, as we strive to create an environment that encourages innovation, fosters commercial partnerships, and unlocks opportunities for both nations. In conclusion, by working together, our countries have the opportunity to usher in a new era of growth, and shared prosperity for both our nations.",
