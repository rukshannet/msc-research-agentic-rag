        "title": "Israeli airstrikes kill at least 35 in Rafah, Gaza authorities say",
        "date": "May 27, 2024 10:03 am",
        "content": "Israeli air strikes killed at least 35 Palestinians and wounded dozens in an area in the southern Gaza Strip city of Rafah designated for the displaced, Palestinian health and civil emergency service officials said. The Israeli military said its air force struck a Hamas compound in Rafah and that the strike was carried out with precise ammunition and on the basis of precise intelligence. It took out Hamas chief of staff for the West Bank and another senior official behind deadly attacks on Israelis, it said. The IDF is aware of reports indicating that as a result of the strike and fire that was ignited several civilians in the area were harmed. The incident is under review. The spokesman for the health ministry in the Hamas-run Gaza, Ashraf Al-Qidra, said 35 people were killed and dozens others, most of them women and children, were wounded in the attack. The strike took place in Tel Al-Sultan neighborhood in western Rafah, where thousands of people were taking shelter after many fled the eastern areas of the city where Israeli forces began a ground offensive over two weeks ago. The International Committee of the Red Cross said its field hospital in Rafah was receiving an influx of casualties, and that other hospitals also were taking in a large number of patients. Senior Hamas official Sami Abu Zuhri described the attack in Rafah as a massacre, holding the United States responsible for aiding Israel with weapons and money. The air strikes burnt the tents, the tents are melting and the peoples bodies are also melting, said one of the residents who arrived at the Kuwaiti hospital in Rafah. Earlier on Sunday, the Israeli military said eight projectiles were identified crossing from the area of Rafah, the southern tip of the Gaza Strip where Israel kept up operations despite a ruling by the top U.N. court on Friday ordering it to stop attacking the city. A number of the projectiles were intercepted, it said. There were no reports of casualties. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was convening his war cabinet later on Sunday to discuss continued operations in Rafah. Israel argues that the U.N. courts ruling allows room for some military action there. In a statement on its Telegram channel, the Hamas al-Qassam Brigades said the rockets were launched in response to Zionist massacres against civilians. Rafah is located about 100 km (60 miles) south of Tel Aviv. Israel says it wants to root out Hamas fighters holed up in Rafah and rescue hostages it says are being held in the area, but its assault has worsened the plight of civilians and caused an international outcry. On Sunday, Israeli strikes killed at least five Palestinians in Rafah, according to local medical services. The Gaza health ministry identified the dead as civilians. Israeli tanks have probed around the edges of Rafah, near the crossing point from Gaza into Egypt, and have entered some of its eastern districts, residents say, but have not yet entered the city in force since the start of operations in the city earlier this month. Israeli war cabinet minister Benny Gantz said the rockets fired from Rafah prove that the (Israel Defense Forces) must operate in every place Hamas still operates from. Defence Minister Yoav Gallant held an operational assessment in Rafah where he was briefed on troops operations above and below the ground, as well as the deepening of operations in additional areas with the aim of dismantling Hamas battalions, his office said in a statement. Itamar Ben Gvir, a hardline public security minister who is not part of Israels war cabinet, urged the army to hit Rafah harder. Rafah with full force, he posted on X. Nearly 36,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israels offensive, Gazas health ministry says. Israel launched the operation after Hamas-led militants attacked southern Israeli communities on Oct. 7, killing around 1,200 people and seizing more than 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies. Fighting also continued in the northern Gaza area of Jabaliya, the scene of intense combat earlier in the war. During one raid, the military said it found a weapons storage site with dozens of rocket parts and weapons at a school. It denied Hamas statements that Palestinian fighters had abducted an Israeli soldier. Hamas media said an Israeli airstrike on a house in a neighborhood near Jabaliya killed 10 people and wounded others. TRUCE TALKS Efforts to agree a halt to the fighting and return more than 120 hostages have been blocked for weeks but there were some signs of movement this weekend following meetings between Israeli and U.S. intelligence officials and Qatars prime minister. An official with knowledge of the matter said a decision had been taken to resume the talks this week based on new proposals from Egyptian and Qatari mediators, and with active U.S. involvement. However, a Hamas official played down the report, telling Reuters: It is not true. Netanyahus war cabinet would discuss the new proposals, his office said. A second Hamas official, Izzat El-Reshiq, said the group had not received anything from the mediators on new dates for resuming talks as had been reported by Israeli media. Reshiq restated Hamass demands, which include: Ending the aggression completely and permanently, in all of Gaza Strip, not only Rafah. While Israel is seeking the return of hostages, Netanyahu has repeatedly said the war will not end until Hamas, which is sworn to Israels destruction, is eliminated. AID TRUCKS ENTER GAZA Israel has faced calls to get more aid into Gaza after more than seven months of a war that has caused widespread destruction and hunger in the enclave. Khaled Zayed of the Egyptian Red Crescent told Reuters 200 trucks of aid, including four fuel trucks, were expected to enter Gaza on Sunday through Kerem Shalom. It follows an agreement between U.S. President Joe Biden and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi on Friday to temporarily send aid via the Kerem Shalom crossing, bypassing the Rafah crossing that has been blocked for weeks. Egypts state-affiliated Al Qahera News TV shared a video on social media platform X, showing what it said were aid trucks as they entered Kerem Shalom, which before the conflict was the main commercial crossing station between Israel, Egypt and Gaza. The Rafah crossing has been shut for almost three weeks, since Israel took control of the Palestinian side of the crossing as it stepped up its offensive. Egypt has been increasingly alarmed at the prospect of large numbers of Palestinians entering its territory from Gaza and has refused to open its side of the Rafah crossing. Israel has said it is not restricting aid flows and has opened up new crossing points in the north as well as cooperating with the United States, which has built a temporary floating pier for aid deliveries.

        "date": "May 27, 2024 02:14 pm",
        "content": "The landslide occurred in the mountainous Enga region in northern Papua New Guinea on Friday and the latest figure is a sharp rise from earlier estimates. Soon after the disaster occurred, the United Nations said as many as 100 may have died. That was later revised up to 670, according to estimates from the Chief of Mission for the International Organization for Migration (IOM) in the country. But that may now be a major underestimate according to the latest projection from Papua New Guineas disaster agency. The landslide buried more than 2000 people alive and caused major destruction to buildings, food gardens and caused major impact on the economic lifeline of the country, Lusete Laso Mana, Acting Director the National Disaster Centre, said in a letter to the UN. The situation remains unstable as the landslip continues to shift slowly, posing ongoing danger to both rescue teams and survivors alike, he added, saying the main highway to the area had been completely blocked by the landslide. Following the inspection conducted by the team, it was determined that the damages are extensive and require immediate and collaborative actions from all players. The landslide hit the remote village of Kaokalam, about 600 kilometers (372 miles) northwest of the capital Port Moresby, at approximately 3 a.m. local time on Friday, leaving a scar of debris that humanitarian workers said was as big as four football pitches. More than 150 houses in Yambali village were buried in debris, officials said on Sunday. The area continues to pose an extreme risk, officials said, as rocks continue to fall and the ground soil is exposed to constant increased pressure. Pierre Rognon, an associate professor from the University of Sydneys School of Civil Engineering, said its particularly challenging for rescuers to find survivors after a landslide. Landslides can bury collapsed structures and people under dozens of meters of geomaterials, he said. To make things worse, they can move structures and trap people over hundreds of meters. No one can predict exactly where potential survivors may be located and where to start looking for them. Its not clear what caused the landslide, but geology professor Alan Collins from the University of Adelaide said it occurred in a region of considerable rainfall. Although the landslide does not appear to have been directly triggered by an earthquake, frequent earthquakes caused by plates colliding build steep slopes and high mountains that can become very unstable, Collins said. He said rainfall could have altered the minerals making the bedrock, weakening the rock that forms the steep hillsides. Vegetation mitigates this as tree roots can stabilise the ground and deforestation can make landslides more prevalent by destroying this biological mesh, he said. Source: CNN --Agencies",

        "date": "May 27, 2024 03:07 pm",
        "content": "Tropical Cyclone Remal made landfall in Bangladesh on Sunday, bringing torrential rain and heavy winds as it continues to move inland across eastern India, toppling trees, turning roads into rivers and causing large-scale damage. More than 1 million vulnerable people across both countries were evacuated from their homes ahead of Remals arrival, authorities said, with volunteers and army staff mobilized to assist with clean-up efforts and distribute food and water to displaced families. Remal made landfall packing gusts of up to 135 kilometers per hour (84 mph) and is moving northwards across Bangladesh and its adjoining West Bengal coasts, the Indian Meteorological Department said. The storm weakened after it hit the coast with wind speeds of up to 115 kilometers per hour (71 mph). Remal is expected to dump more than 89mm (3.5 inches) of rain and bring wind-driven storm surges of 2.5 to 3.7 meters to the coasts of the Bay of Bengal, according to CNN Weather. The maritime ports of Mongla and Payra in Bangladesh put up the Great Danger Signal 10  the highest alert signal  on Sunday, and all fishing and boating vessels have been advised to remain in shelter by the Bangladesh Meteorological Department. About 2 million people live in storm-affected areas in Bangladesh, according to non-profit BRAC. At least half a million of these people live in houses made of materials such as clay, wood, plastic sheets, straw or tin, said Dr. Md Liakath Ali, a disaster expert at BRAC. Millions are without power as authorities shut down electricity supply to many areas in advance to avoid accidents, according to Ali. Fallen trees and broken lines disrupted supply, he said. An especially vulnerable group are the stateless Rohingya communities who fled persecution in nearby Myanmar during a military crackdown in 2017. They are already living in the worlds largest refugee camps in Coxs Bazar, which is at risk of landslides and floods, owing to the flimsy structure of their shelters. Many live in bamboo and tarpaulin shelters perched on hilly slopes that are vulnerable to strong winds, rain, and landslides. Video taken by a BRACs volunteer early Monday in Mongla showed a woman struggling to walk through the floodwaters as gusts of wind nearly toppled her over. In India, video from the countrys National Disaster Response Force showed workers removing broken trees in the state of West Bengal as heavy rain lashed down on them. The Coast Guard was seen closely monitoring Remals landfall, with ships and hovercraft on standby to respond to any challenges, it said. Flights were also impacted following the closure on Sunday of the main international airport in Kolkata, West Bengals capital. Tropical Cyclone Remal has been churning across the Bay of Bengal since late last week prompting authorities to prepare ahead of its arrival. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday said he had reviewed disaster management and preparation efforts. I pray for everyones safety and wellbeing, Modi wrote on X. Cyclones, also known as typhoons and called hurricanes in North America, are enormous heat engines of wind and rain that feed on warm ocean water and moist air. And scientists say the climate crisis is making them more potent. A study published in 2021 by researchers at the Shenzhen Institute of Meteorological Innovation and the Chinese University of Hong Kong and published in Frontiers in Earth Science found that tropical cyclones in Asia could have double the destructive power by the end of the century, with scientists saying the human-made climate crisis is already making them stronger. The cyclone comes as parts of Western and Central India continue to bake under severe heat, with temperatures soaring beyond 45 degrees Celsius (113 Fahrenheit) in some cities, causing illness and forcing some schools to close. Climate scientists have long warned that these extremes of weather will only continue to intensify because of the climate crisis, with millions of people in India vulnerable to the risks associated with it.

        "date": "May 27, 2024 04:33 pm",
        "content": "Anora, a darkly funny and touching drama about a young exotic dancer who becomes involved with a Russian oligarchs son, won the Cannes Film Festivals top prize, the Palme dOr, on Saturday. The film by U.S. director Sean Baker beat the 21 other films in the competition line-up, including entries by established directors like Francis Ford Coppola and David Cronenberg. Anora continues a streak of sex worker-focused films by Baker, including the 2021 Cannes entry Red Rocket and 2017s The Florida Project starring Willem Dafoe. This win is dedicated to to all sex workers past present and future, he said while accepting the award, while also thanking the films star, Mikey Madison, as well as his wife and producer. Madison plays the character of the title, who meets Vanya, the immature son of a Russian oligarch with seemingly unlimited money, while working at a strip club. Vanya, played by Mark Eydelshteyn, hires Anora to be his girlfriend for a week, deciding on a whim to take his private plane to party in Las Vegas, where they get married. That decision upsets his disapproving parents so much that they jet over from Russia to ensure he gets an annulment. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "date": "May 27, 2024 06:53 pm",
        "content": "Sri Lanka hopes to work closer with Saudi Arabia in tourism, labor and renewable energy sectors to support the Kingdoms Vision 2030, the island nations new ambassador told Arab News as he assumed his post in Riyadh on Monday. A career diplomat, Omar Lebbe Ameer Ajwad concurrently served as ambassador in Oman and Yemen from 2019 to 2022. He had previously served as Sri Lankas acting high commissioner in Singapore and deputy high commissioner in Chennai, India. With around 26 years of experience, one of his earliest postings was as the deputy chief of mission at the Sri Lankan Embassy in Riyadh. As he lauded Saudi Arabias Vision 2030, Ajwad said that Sri Lanka can contribute to the transformation and diversification project. Sri Lanka wishes to partner with Saudi Arabia in this transformative journey. Therefore, my primary focus would be on promoting economic diplomacy, he told Arab News over the weekend. Sri Lanka and Saudi Arabia are well poised for greater connectivity and deeper economic cooperation and synergies. With Saudi Arabia and Sri Lanka celebrating their 50th anniversary of diplomatic relations this year, Ajwad is set on charting pathways for future cooperation to achieve another milestone of productive relations. Key sectors in Saudi Arabias diversification efforts, such as tourism, transportation and logistics, and renewable energy correspond to Sri Lankas potentials and priorities, he added. As such, Sri Lanka wants to tap into the possibilities posed by Saudi megaprojects, including the flagship multibillion-dollar NEOM smart city. Sri Lankas skilled and semi-skilled workforce could support various aspects of construction, engineering, and service industries required for projects such as NEOM, Ajwad said. Sri Lankan workers can provide expertise and technology in NEOMs renewable energy sector, agricultural projects and the citys information technology development. Saudi Arabia is a major labor-receiving country for Sri Lanka, with tens of thousands of workers from the island nation living in the Kingdom  making it one of the main sources of foreign remittances for Colombo. NEOM also aims to become a major tourist destination. Sri Lankas well-established tourism sector expertise, especially in sustainable and eco-tourism, can provide insights and professional services to develop NEOMs hospitality sector, the ambassador said. Ajwad will work on increasing engagements between Saudi and Sri Lankan public and private sectors through political consultation between their foreign ministries and setting up a bilateral business council. I strongly believe that the setting up of strong platforms for the bilateral engagements will serve as a catalyst for the much-needed information flow, networking, and follow-up with a view to fostering greater cooperation between the two countries.

At 05:40 am, a phone call was received from the IGI airport regarding a bomb threat.

        "date": "May 28, 2024 11:07 am",
        "content": "Amnesty International along with other organizations have urgently called on the Sri Lankan Government to halt the current proposals for a new Labour Law and to ensure that reforms to the labour laws are only taken after due consultation with workers and their representatives. We express our serious concerns over the proposed reforms which, as they stand, would weaken the rights and protection of workers by removing international minimum standards and rights, rights group said. In an open letter to the Government and Parliament of Sri Lanka on the imminent labour law reforms, the coalition has raised significant concerns that the proposed reforms if implemented without proper consultation, would weaken workers rights and protections by eliminating international minimum standards and rights. Amnesty International, Clean Clothes Campaign and Human Rights Watch express serious concerns about imminent and sweeping changes to Sri Lankan labour laws. We fear for the future of Sri Lankas garment industrynot just for workers but also how the proposed reforms would negatively impact brands human rights risk assessments and responsible sourcing if these changes are pushed through. They urge the government to immediately halt the current reform process and to ensure that additional new steps towards any necessary reforms to the labour laws are only taken in due consultation with workers and their representatives. The concerns expressed in this letter reflect and follow those repeatedly expressed through protests and raised by a broad coalition of unions and civil society organisations in Sri Lanka, the letter said. The proposed draft Act contains many articles weakening the rights and protection of workers by removing international minimum standards and rights, it warned, adding, the draft Act contains clauses which threaten Sri Lankas compliance with international law, including ILO conventions No. 87, 98, 144, and 190. While there has been no clarity around the proposed timetable for discussion and passage of the draft Act, we understand that the proposed unified labour code could be placed for voting in the parliament soon. The Sri Lankan garment industry has tried to set itself apart from other garment producing countries with the slogan Garments Without Guilt. The imminent reforms threaten to make Sri Lankans garment factories synonymous with the worst forms of sweatshop labour instead, the organisations warned. We, therefore, urge you to immediately halt the existing labour reform process and start an alternative process, which is transparent, consensus-based, includes all tripartite stakeholders, and meets the established Sri Lankan democratic processes on consultation, translation, and publication so all workers and their representatives to enable their effective participation, to work towards a unified labour code that respects international labour rights standards.",

The Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) National Organiser stated that extending the terms of the President and the Parliament undermines the fundamental principles of a democratic society. Stability should come through the will of the people, not by delaying their voice, he said in a post on X (formerly Twitter). Rajapaksas comments come likely in response to a statement made by the General Secretary of the United National Party (UNP) Palitha Range Bandara, proposing for the postponement of the two upcoming elections by two years. Speaking at a press conference in Colombo today (28), he proposed that the Presidential Election and the General Election be postponed for 2 years, through a proposal to be tabled in Parliament and that a referendum could be called if necessary. Now we have to save the country from this bankruptcy and rebuild the countrys economy, Range Bandara said. He stated that Sri Lanka has an agreement in place with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and if the said agreement is violated the country will regress back to how it was two years back. So, do we want to knowingly go back to that point and get ruined? Or else do we reach a common agreement and postpone both these elections for two years? The President is not greedy to stay on. We are the ones asking, he said, adding that funds should not be wasted by going for a general election at this time. Postpone them both for two years. These issues can be resolved within those two years and afterwards elections can be held, Range Bandara added.",

        "content": "The Gujarat Anti-Terrorist Squad (ATS) is preparing to visit Sri Lanka to further investigate the arrest of four ISIS terrorists at Ahmedabad airport. This development comes as Sri Lankan police have detained two individuals related to the case, while a third suspect, Osmond Gerrard, remains at large. Sri Lanka has declared Gerrard wanted and announced a Rs. 2 million reward for his capture. Gujarat Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS) thwarted a potential terror attack with the arrest of four Sri Lankan nationals at Ahmedabad airport on May 20. The apprehended suspects, identified as Mohammad Nusrat (33), Mohammad Farish (35), Mohammad Nafran (27), and Mohammad Rashdeen (43), are believed to be linked to the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS). The arrests of the four ISIS terrorists by the Gujarat ATS have taken a new turn with the discovery of objectionable materials in their residences. Mobile phones belonging to the terrorists have been seized and are currently under investigation by the ATS team. Preliminary findings suggest that the terrorists were in contact with a Muslim preacher named Abu Pakistani and had spent 42 days with him for indoctrination. Three dedicated teams from the Gujarat ATS are actively investigating leads outside the state. Their efforts have revealed that Osmond Gerrard provided the four terrorists with four lakh rupees and has been known to change his appearance frequently to evade capture. Acting on information from the ATS, Sri Lankan authorities have detained two individuals, though Gerrard continues to elude arrest. The investigation has uncovered that three additional individuals assisted the terrorists in their activities in India. The ATS is now focusing on these accomplices and examining the mobile phones of the arrested terrorists for further clues. Notably, it has been discovered that a weapon was delivered via drone over the Pakistan border in Punjab, adding a significant dimension to the case. In their meticulous investigation, the ATS has analyzed CCTV data from 78,000 vehicles near Chiloda, checking 13,000 vehicles for any leads. Additionally, three ATS teams have been dispatched to Delhi, Rajasthan, and Punjab to pursue various angles of the investigation. Source: The Free Press Journal --Agencies",

The explosion occurred near Central Square Tuesday afternoon, police said, urging people to avoid the area. It is unclear what caused the explosion, which impacted a building that contains a Chase bank and apartments, authorities said. Youngstown Fire Chief Barry Finley had initially characterized the incident as a natural gas explosion, but later said crews were working to determine if there was a gas leak. All I know for sure is that there was an explosion, Finley told reporters during a press briefing Tuesday evening. Mercy Health said Tuesday evening it is treating seven people who were injured in the incident, including one person in critical condition. Following a search of the building, a man and woman remain unaccounted for, Finley said. The man is an employee of the bank, the fire chief said. Police were searching for his vehicle in the wake of the explosion, he said. Until then, we have to assume he is in the building, Finley said. The floor collapsed into the basement, which was flooded, and search crews were working to send a mini-drone in there to aid in the search effort, Finley said. The Chase bank is located on the ground floor of the building, with apartment units on the 12 floors above. The building has been evacuated and streets in the surrounding area have been closed to traffic indefinitely due to the potential for a structural collapse, authorities said. A Chase spokesperson told ABC News the company is in close contact with local officials to check on the safety of everyone in the building and area. After that, well work to determine what happened and to assess the damage, the spokesperson said. There is no evidence of any suspicious activity at this time, officials said.

        "date": "May 29, 2024 12:12 pm",
        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe has called on all stakeholders, including private sector investors, to support and develop a long-term plan for advancing Sri Lankas energy sector transformation and promoting green growth efforts. During the Advancing Energy Transition roundtable discussion at the Hilton Colombo this morning (29), Wickremesinghe emphasized the need for a comprehensive plan to exploit renewable energy and explore future trends in green hydrogen in Sri Lanka. The event, held in collaboration with the World Bank, the Ministry of Power and Energy, and the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB), provided a platform for discussing the countrys energy transition, the PMD reported. President Wickremesinghe highlighted a recent report by PricewaterhouseCoopers on green hydrogen, noting its importance and the necessity for detailed planning to leverage this emerging sector. He acknowledged the gaps in local expertise and called for international assistance from organizations such as the World Bank (WB), the Asian Development Bank (ADB), and all stakeholders, including local and international investors. He stressed that Sri Lanka is committed to creating a sustainable and competitive economy, with renewable energy playing a pivotal role. The President outlined the countrys legislative efforts, including the recently passed Electricity Reform Bill and the upcoming Climate Change Act, aimed at facilitating this transition. President Ranil Wickremesinghe further said: As we are emerging from bankruptcy, Sri Lanka is now focusing on a new economic framework, a transition into a highly competitive export-oriented economy, an economy committed to achieving net-zero, and an economy committed to modernizing agriculture. We have already started the work and now comes the planning stage: what are the new sectors of the economy, what are the energy sources for Sri Lanka, and this is where green energy and green hydrogen come into the picture. We have sufficient potential to emerge as a player in the field of renewable energy. Sri Lankas dry zone and its potential for wind power are such that we have identified this sector for rapid development. It is also in line with Sri Lankas commitment to achieving net-zero. As I said, 2050 is too long. Let us try and see whether we can do it by 2040. And we are working on this. So let me now outline for you the steps we have taken. We have already brought in the Electricity Reform Bill, which was approved by the Supreme Court about two days ago with a number of amendments that the ministry finds acceptable. We will have this bill debated in Parliament and passed in the near future. Second is the Economic Transformation Bill, which has already been tabled in Parliament. There are challenges with the Supreme Court, and certainly by early July, this should be passed into law. So these are two legislative enactments called into play. Then we will also be looking at two other pieces of legislation. One is the Climate Change Act. The Climate Change Act is being drafted and is the third piece of legislation. Fourth, which we have to discuss, is whether we need energy transition legislation also. Some countries have energy transition legislation. We have also looked at that. We have looked at some areas such as South Australia. It may be useful for us to have energy transition legislation. One is we are going to a new sector. We are opening it up, not merely for power generation but for power distribution. We will have the private sector playing the lead role. So it is going to be private-sector-driven. There is no other way in which we can achieve our targets by 2040 or, for that matter, 2050. The Ministry of Finance will also work with others. The Ministry of Environment and the Ministry of Power will work on a green finance policy. So the green finance policy will also drive us. These are the components that we will have for the transition into green hydrogen and using renewable energy. Next comes the issue of green hydrogen and our potential for green hydrogen. The estimate is about 40 gigawatts, maybe more. There is also the issue of how we safeguard bird life in the Mannar area. I think, in my view, this can be done and should be done. Nevertheless, there is significant potential for green hydrogen. But there are many more questions to be answered about green hydrogen today than earlier. We have to work on what the cost is and when it will be attractive for private-sector investments. I note that India has already included the export of green hydrogen in its plans, with a fairly substantial amount of green hydrogen. Secondly, there are new undersea cables coming for power distribution. One is between Australia and Singapore, and the other is between Singapore and India. Now Sri Lanka has the potential to connect to the Indo-Singapore undersea cable. That is where the potential is. While looking at the uses of green hydrogen, we feel that it will help us in the long term to become a logistics centre for the region. We have three ports: Trincomalee, which is close to green hydrogen sources; Hambantota in the south, where there is also green hydrogen available; and finally Colombo. This should be the area. We are also discussing about a land bridge with India and land connectivity between South India and Sri Lanka, which means we also have the potential of reaching out into South India. In any case, we are discussing power link connectivity between Sri Lanka and India. So all this will fall into place and it is how we use it. What is the framework we have for the exploitation of renewable energy in Sri Lanka, and what will be the future trends of green hydrogen? About a month ago, PricewaterhouseCoopers put out its latest report on green hydrogen, which is very interesting. So we have to work this out. But what we want from you all is a plan for Sri Lanka to go ahead. That is why we have to call everyone in. We dont have full expertise, I must admit. We need assistance from outside. So World Bank, ADB, and others who are interested, certainly come in. Because we are committed to a green economy and we want to go ahead. This, in short, is what Sri Lanka is planning to do. The rest of the details I leave it to you to tell the government what needs to be done. World Bank Country Director for Sri Lanka, Faris H. Hadad-Zervos, highlighted the pivotal moment for Sri Lankas energy future, emphasizing the need for renewable energy investments to drive economic growth. He commended Sri Lankas ambitious goal to achieve 70 electricity from renewables by 2030 and become a regional leader. The Climate Prosperity Plan, unveiled at COP27, outlines the national investment strategy for achieving climate objectives. Hadad-Zervos praised Sri Lankas strides in expanding renewable energy, particularly in solar and wind power procurement. He stressed the importance of enhancing institutional capacity and regulatory frameworks for renewable energy procurement to attract private sector investments. The Government of Sri Lanka has embarked on ambitious power sector reforms to improve governance, efficiency, and financial sustainability. The World Bank Group, in collaboration with other partners, supports these reforms through policy advice, technical assistance, and financial products. Moving forward, Hadad-Zervos emphasized the need for a comprehensive roadmap and clear procurement frameworks to attract private investments for renewable energy projects. He called for joint action from stakeholders, including policymakers, development partners, and the private sector, to realize Sri Lankas ambitious energy goals. Private sector investments and innovations will be crucial in transforming Sri Lankas energy sector, generating employment, and enhancing energy security. Hadad-Zervos concluded by thanking President Ranil Wickremesinghe, Minister Kanchana Wijesekara, and the Ministry of Power and Energy for their leadership and commitment in advancing Sri Lankas energy transition. Meanwhile, Minister of Power and Energy Kanchana Wijesekara highlighted Sri Lankas strategic initiatives and on-going efforts in the renewable energy sector, emphasizing collaboration with international partners for the countrys energy transition. Notable progress includes Supreme Court approval of reforms aimed at driving renewable energy adoption, ensuring security, and lowering costs. Minister Wijesekara emphasized Sri Lankas ambitious renewable energy targets, aiming for 70 renewable energy by 2030 and advancing carbon neutrality to 2040. This commitment includes a policy against new coal power plants, aligned with principles from COP26. However, challenges persist, notably the integration of 4000 megawatts of new renewable energy into the grid by 2030. The Minister also outlined challenges faced in integrating renewable energy sources over the past two years, primarily due to the financial crisis deterring high-level developers from investing in Sri Lanka. While local developers and some international partnerships exist, they bear significant risks. Discussions with development partners have focused on mitigating these risks through financial and technical tools. Infrastructure development is another significant hurdle, particularly in identified renewable energy zones in the northern and eastern parts of Sri Lanka. An estimated 6 billion investment over the next six years is needed to develop infrastructure, including integrating nine backbone lines with other transmission lines. He emphasized the need for additional technical assistance in evaluating projects and determining appropriate pricing to attract the right investors with suitable technology and ensure competitive pricing for consumers. Acknowledging the importance of empowering agencies involved in the energy sector, he clarified that the reform bill aims to strengthen rather than weaken them. Specifically, he highlighted the importance of empowering the Ceylon Electricity Board, the Sustainable Energy Authority, and the regulator, proposing the establishment of an individual regulator empowered to oversee the electricity sector. Minister Wijesekara stressed the necessity of continued support to achieve these goals effectively. State Ministers of Power and Energy D.V. Chanka and Indika Anuruddha Herath, along with Advisor to the President on Climate Change Ruwan Wijewardena, Secretary to the Ministry of Power and Energy Dr. Sulakshana Jayawardena, Chairman of the Ceylon Electricity Board Nalinda Illangakoon, senior officials from the Ministry and representatives from The World Bank, AIIB, JICA, USAID, ADB, and other relevant organizations were present at the event. --PMD",

He made these comments while responding to questions from journalists after attending the opening of the Martin Wickramasinghe Hall of Life section at the National Library and Documentation Services Board today (29). The governments stand on the election has already been announced. The Election Commission declared that the presidential election can be held according to the constitution. They have announced that it will be scheduled between the months of September and October. The government has also announced that, he said. Replying to a question on allegations that the government is trying to postpone the election after seeing the crowd for its May Day, the Premier said: No political decision will be taken after seeing a crowd. We will not be panicked or reversed, but will move forward. He added: Steps have been taken according to the accepted election law for the development of the country by advancing the supreme parliamentary system and the peoples mandate. There is a two-thirds system that is very difficult to be followed to change the election rules. Otherwise, the parliament can go on until next August. If necessary it can be dissolved earlier. Or they can dissolve it by themselves. There is a system in the constitution to do so. After the Presidential election, it will be the general election. Later, attention has been paid on holding provincial council and local government elections at the same time. Some people declare various things without responsibility. I am telling the countrymen that a Democratic government or parliament will not allow the government to make sudden announcements about something that has not been discussed in any situation and to create unrest in the country irresponsibly. The Election Commission has the power to call the Presidential election, according to the Constitution. It cannot be called in advance or later. It has been fixed in the constitution. Accordingly, the Election Commission will conduct the election as scheduled.",

        "date": "May 29, 2024 05:00 pm",
        "content": "Preliminary findings released on Wednesday of an investigation into a Singapore Airlines flight hit by severe turbulence last week showed that a rapid change in gravitational force and a 54-metre altitude drop caused injuries. A 73-year-old passenger died of a suspected heart attack and dozens were injured after flight SQ321, flying from London to Singapore, encountered what the airline described as sudden, extreme turbulence while flying over Myanmar. The May 21 flight on a Boeing 777-300ER plane carrying 211 passengers and 18 crew diverted to Bangkok for an emergency landing after the plane was buffeted by turbulence that flung passengers and crew around the cabin, slamming some into the ceiling. The aircraft experienced a rapid change in G (gravitational force)  This likely resulted in the occupants who were not belted up to become airborne, the Singapore Transport Ministry said in a statement. The vertical acceleration changed from negative 1.5G to positive 1.5G within 4 seconds. This likely resulted in the occupants who were airborne to fall back down, it said, citing information extracted from the flight data and cockpit voice recorders. The rapid changes in G over the 4.6 seconds duration resulted in an altitude drop of 178 ft (54 m), from 37,362 ft to 37,184 ft. This sequence of events likely caused the injuries to the crew and passengers, it added. CHAOTIC SCENES Shaken passengers described scenes of chaos in the minutes after the incident, with the turbulence throwing people upwards then into the aisle, many left with bleeding and head wounds. Photographs of the cabin showed gashes in the overhead cabin panels, oxygen masks and panels hanging from the ceiling and luggage strewn around. A passenger said some peoples heads had slammed into lights above the seats and broken the panels. Singapore Airlines said it acknowledged the report and was cooperating fully with the investigation. The airline late on Tuesday had said 42 people who were on board the flight were still in Bangkok, including 26 passengers receiving medical treatment in hospital. Among those initially hospitalised were patients with spinal cord injuries and some with brain and skull injuries, according to Thai medical officials. The preliminary report said that upon the flight encountering slight vibrations there was an uncommanded increase in altitude, resulting in the autopilot pitching the aircraft downwards. The pilots experienced an increase in airspeed and responded by applying speed brakes. While managing the airspeed  it was heard that a pilot called out that the fasten seat belt sign had been switched on, it said. Hong Kongs Greater Bay Airlines said on Wednesday it would require passengers to fasten seatbelt at all times during the flight even when the seat belt sign is off, starting from Thursday. The company said its not a mandatory requirement but a precautionary measure for passenger safety. The investigation team comprised Singaporean investigators, and U.S. representatives from Boeing, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). The Singapore transport ministry said the probe was ongoing. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "date": "May 29, 2024 05:01 pm",
        "content": "Nvidias shares rallied around 6 to hit a record high on Tuesday, leaving the AI chipmakers stock market value about 100 billion away from overtaking Apple in a major reshuffle of Wall streets biggest players. Last trading at 1,128, Nvidias market capitalization reached 2.8 trillion, compared to a market value of 2.9 trillion for Apple, which is Wall Streets second-most valuable company after Microsoft. Its stock surged as much as 8 to 1,149.39 during the session, an intra-day record high. Apples stock was down 0.2 in afternoon trading. Nvidias shares have surged nearly 13 since it forecast second-quarter revenue above Wall Street expectations last week and announced a stock split, which excited investors as they continue to bet on the AI poster child. The market has been struggling to keep up with the companys ever improving growth trajectory. At a mid-thirties forward earnings multiple, this still doesnt feel like bubble territory, said Derren Nathan, head of equity analysis at Hargreaves Lansdown. Nvidia recently traded at 36 times its forward profit estimates, compared with 38 for Advanced Micro Devices and 21 for Intel, according to LSEG data. The companys shares have more than doubled so far this year after more than tripling last year. Nvidia, which has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of the AI boom, reported a five-fold jump in revenue at its data center segment last week as customers line up for their high-performance chips. Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon.com and other technology companies have been competing for a limited supply of Nvidias high-end chips as they race to dominate AI computing. Business is doing incredibly well, there are so many opportunities to keep growing, and the AI theme still has legs. When the song is that catchy, investors want to keep humming it all day long, said Dan Coatsworth, investment analyst at AJ Bell when asked about the stocks rally. Long considered a must-own stock on Wall Street, Apple has underperformed other Big Tech companies in recent months, falling around 2 this year as it struggles with weak iPhone demand and tough competition in China. Microsoft overtook Apple as the worlds most valuable company earlier this year as it raced ahead of other tech firms due to gains made by early investments in artificial intelligence across its cloud services. Microsofts shares were down 0.4 on Tuesday, giving it a market value of 3.1 trillion. Apple has also been slower in rolling out generative AI, which can generate human-like responses to written prompts, than rivals such as Microsoft and Google, which are weaving them into products.

        "date": "May 29, 2024 05:12 pm",
        "content": "Lawyers for singer Nick Carter have described claims of sexual assault made against him in a new documentary as outrageous. Fallen Idols: Nick and Aaron Carter, released this week, includes allegations about the Backstreet Boys singer from three women. Melissa Schuman, Shannon Ruth and Ashley Repp have alleged assaults during the early 2000s and are suing Carter. He has filed a countersuit against all three women for defamation. In a statement to the Los Angeles Times, the singers legal team said the women were spreading falsehoods. These are exactly the same outrageous claims that led us to sue this gang of conspirators, the statement read. Those cases are working their way through the legal system now, and, based on both the initial court rulings and the overwhelming evidence, we have every belief that we will prevail and hold them accountable for spreading these falsehoods. The singer reportedly declined to take part in the new four-part docuseries, which premiered in the US on Monday. Ms Ruth filed a civil sexual battery lawsuit against Carter in 2022, alleging he raped her in 2001, when she was 17, following a Backstreet Boys concert in Tacoma, Washington. A representative for Carter called the allegations legally meritless and entirely untrue. Carter countersued Ms Ruth two months after she filed her suit, describing her as an opportunist who allegedly conspired with Ms Schuman to extort him. Ms Schuman, a former member of girl group Dream, accused Carter of rape in 2017, but prosecutors did not file charges because the statute of limitations had expired. She then filed a civil lawsuit in April 2023, alleging Carter sexually assaulted her in 2002 in Santa Monica when he was 22 and she was 18. Ms Repp filed her lawsuit in August 2023, alleging Carter assaulted her three times in Florida in 2003 when she was 15 and he was 23. Carters lawyer called Ms Repps accusations ridiculous and added her to the defamation countersuit in January 2024. The series, broadcast by Investigation Discovery, also examines the rift between Carter and his late brother. Before his death, singer Aaron Carter publicly supported the women who accused his older brother of sexual assault. The docuseries also studies the mental health struggles of Aaron Carter before he died at the age of 34 in November 2022. Source: BBC --Agencies",

        "date": "May 29, 2024 09:15 pm",
        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe emphasized that none of the candidates aspiring to run in the presidential election have announced their intention to abolish the executive powers associated with the position. The President highlighted the dual nature of the executive presidential system, noting its advantages and disadvantages. He emphasized that the executive power vested in the presidency played a pivotal role in the economic development of Sri Lanka and the resolution of the 30-year war. President Wickremesinghe made these remarks while participating in the Whats New dialogue on legal reforms with young legal professionals at a workshop held yesterday (28) at the Presidential Secretariat. President Wickremesinghe emphasized the importance of enacting laws that render the President accountable to Parliament. He noted the decentralization of certain executive powers to Provincial Councils and Parliamentary Oversight Committees, highlighting forthcoming divisions in this regard. Moreover, President Wickremesinghe affirmed the inevitability of future Presidential elections, stating that financial provisions for this purpose have already been allocated. The President further stated: Sri Lanka boasts multiple governance systems. One resembles the English model, epitomized by the cabinet, while the other adopts the executive presidential system, where the President wields executive authority. The legislature holds legislative powers. Notably, the President and the legislature may hail from different political parties. Examining the Swiss parliamentary setup, parliament appoints seven individuals to the federal committee, granting executive authority to the Federal Council. In adherence to a customary practice, the two primary parties receive two seats each, while the remaining parties are allocated one seat each. Subsequently, these councillors convene to discuss the distribution of responsibilities among institutions, collectively exercising executive authority. Additionally, the Prime Minister holds the authority to appoint and dismiss ministers within the cabinet. Annually, one of the seven councillors ascends to the Chairmanship. Alternatively, the Donoughmore system, once employed in Sri Lanka, involved dividing the executive structure into seven components. Among these, one served as the speaker, while another was elected as the chairman, simultaneously assuming the role of minister. Further, a minister was designated as the Leader of the House. The governor appointed three additional secretaries, resulting in a council of ministers comprised of ten individuals. Among these, the chief secretary chaired the council, where decisions were deliberated and finalized. Following the previous systems, the French model emerged, where the executive president is elected via popular vote and members of Parliament are chosen by the electorate. This approach is predominantly adopted in Sri Lanka, possessing both advantages and disadvantages. During President J. R. Jayawardenas tenure as Executive President, significant strides were made for the country, marked by the implementation of major projects such as Mahaveli, Samanala wewa, and Lunugamvehera. Additionally, Kotte was elevated to the status of a capital city, and two trading zones were established. Notably, these developmental endeavours were executed amidst an eleven-year-long war. Similarly, President Premadasa initiated the establishment of around two hundred garment factories. The presence of the executive presidency was pivotal in Sri Lankas victory in the war, thwarting foreign hopes of inducing crisis and government collapse. The ability to apply executive power, exemplified by President Mahinda Rajapaksa, facilitated the deployment of the military and eventual triumph in the conflict. During the tenure of the good governance government, there was a notable disconnect between the Executive President and the rest of the government. The presence of executive powers was crucial in maintaining stability during the Aragalaya. This was evident when there was no clear successor for the premiership. On a particular occasion, when the President departed for Trincomalee, some individuals urged me to resign from my position as Prime Minister. However, I asserted that I could only resign if there was a parliamentary majority, and even then, the resignation letter would need to be submitted to the President. Resigning under external pressure or due to personal reasons, such as threats to my residence, would risk the ascension of someone outside the democratic process to power. In the future, we will hold the presidential election. None of the candidates vying for the position have announced plans to abolish its executive authority. Its imperative that we develop a program geared towards reinforcing the parliaments role and capabilities. Currently, some executive powers have been delegated to the Provincial Council, while others have been assigned to various commissions. Furthermore, parliamentary oversight committees are operational. As more bills are introduced and debated in parliament, there will be a gradual shift of presidential powers to the Parliament, the legislative body. Enacting laws that render the President accountable to Parliament is imperative. The governments agenda for the next four years should be outlined through the newly introduced Economic Transformation Act. Progress on implemented programs each year ought to be reported to Parliament annually. Mr. Karu Jayasuriyas proposed Jana Sabha system appears highly feasible. Additionally, its worth noting the practicality of the forthcoming gender equality law. --PMD",

        "title": "Thailand set to indict former PM Thaksin over royal insult",
        "date": "May 29, 2024 11:17 pm",
        "content": "(Reuters) - Thailands attorney-general will indict former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra for allegedly insulting the monarchy, an official said on Wednesday, in a setback to a political heavyweight whose loyalists are currently in government. The complaint, lodged by the royalist military that ousted the government of his sister, Yingluck Shinawatra, had stemmed from an interview the influential tycoon gave to foreign media in 2015. Other charges include violating a computer crime law. The attorney-general has decided to indict Thaksin on all charges, spokesperson Prayuth Bejraguna said, adding he must appear in court on June 18. Thaksin, 74, denies wrongdoing and has repeatedly pledged loyalty to the crown, criticism of which is forbidden under Thailands lese-majeste law, one of the worlds strictest of its kind. Thaksin would be the highest-profile case among more than 270 prosecutions in recent years under the controversial law, which carries a maximum jail term of 15 years for each perceived insult of the royal family. Thaksin did not appear at Wednesdays hearing, having been infected with COVID-19. His lawyer, Winyat Chartmontri, said a comprehensive defence had been prepared and Thaksin would seek bail. He questioned the authenticity of the video of the interview in which the alleged insult was made. Thaksin Shinawatra is ready to prove his innocence in the justice system, Winyat told a press conference. CENTRAL FIGURE Thaksin founded the populist Pheu Thai party. His familys parties have won all but one election since 2001, with three Shinawatra governments toppled by coups or court rulings. The billionaire returned to Thailand in 2023 from 15 years of self-imposed exile, during which he remained a central figure throughout repeated bouts of political upheaval. He was convicted of abuse of power and conflicts of interest and sentenced to eight years in prison, later commuted to one year by the king. He was released on parole in February after just six months in detention. Pheu Thai leads the current government, with Thaksins business ally Srettha Thavisin the prime minister and daughter Paetongtarn Shinawatra the party chief. The indictment was announced days after an opposition lawmaker and an activist musician were given jail terms for alleged royal insults. The palace typically does not comment on the law. The popular opposition Move Forward Party has found itself in hot water over its campaign to amend the law, with the Constitutional Court due to decide whether to dissolve the party, which would see bans for its leadership. A separate complaint with another body is seeking life bans for 44 current and former Move Forward legislators. Thaksins smooth return and relatively short time in detention, spent in hospital, has fueled speculation he struck a deal with his rivals in the conservative establishment and military, which he has blamed for trying to stifle Shinawatra governments. His allies have denied any such pact. Thaksin has been active since his release, meeting supporters and politicians, while saying he has retired from politics. Commentators have anticipated he will wield significant political influence from behind the scenes, raising the possibility of another confrontation with the establishment. Political analyst Titipol Phakdeewanich said the indictment could be an attempt by authorities to show balance, in light of royal insults cases against activists and Move Forward, but that recent developments indicated Thaksin will still be able to weather this. Thitinan Pongsudhirak of Chulalongkorn University said the indictment could be a warning to Thaksin to stay in line.

        "content": "The prevailing showery and windy conditions over the island are expected to continue further, due to the active Southwest Monsoonal condition, according to the Meteorology Department. Showers will occur at times in Western, Sabaragamuwa, Central and Southern provinces while several spells of showers will occur in North-western province. Fairly heavy showers above 75 mm are likely at some places in Western and Sabaragamuwa province and in Nuwara-Eliya district. Showers or thundershowers will occur at a few places in Uva province and in Ampara and Batticaloa districts in the evening or night, it said. Strong winds of about 50-60 kmph can be expected at times over Western slopes of the central hills and in North-central, Western, Southern and North-western provinces and in Trincomalee and Monaragala districts. Sea Areas: The sea areas around the island will be rough or very rough due to the active south-west monsoonal condition. Naval and fishing communities are advised not to venture into the sea areas extending from Kankasanthurai to Pottuvil via Mannar, Colombo, Galle and Hambantota, until further notice and be vigilant in the other sea areas around the island. Waves heights may increase up to about 2.5 m  3.5 m in the sea areas off the coast, extending from Kalpitiya to Pottuvil via Colombo, Galle, and Hambantota. Therefore, there is a possibility that nearshore sea areas extending from Kalpitiya to Matara via Colombo and Galle, may experience surges due to sea waves. Temporarily strong gusty winds and very rough seas can be expected during thundershowers.",

        "title": "UK Parliament dissolves ahead of July 4 general election",
        "date": "May 30, 2024 08:51 am",
        "content": "The British parliament dissolved on Thursday ahead of a July 4 general election, which looks set to bring Labour to power after 14 years of Conservative rule. Five weeks of campaigning officially began as 650 seats of members of parliament (MPs) became vacant at one minute past midnight (2301 GMT) in line with the electoral schedule. The first week of campaigning has seen a shaky start following Prime Minister Rishi Sunaks rain-drenched election announcement, with many observers taking the downpour as a bad omen. Sunak set the election for July 4, instead of later in the year as had been widely expected, in what observers said was an attempt to regain momentum as his party slides in opinion polls. After 14 years in opposition, the Labour party now has the chance to win back power with its leader Keir Starmer, a former human rights lawyer, at the helm. - Mass exodus - Trailing double digits behind Labour in polls, the ruling party also faced a mass exodus of parliamentarians, some throwing in the towel in the face of bleak chances of victory. Some 129 MPs have so far announced that they will not be standing for re-election. Among them are 77 Conservatives, an unprecedented exodus for a governing party. Among the Tories standing for re-election, some have made no secret of their annoyance at having been caught off guard by the July election date. Steve Baker, Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, stood by his decision to continue his vacation in Greece, saying that he would be preparing his campaign there. Signs of infighting also spilled into the open with one Tory MP backing a candidate from the right-wing populist Reform UK party in her constituency, before being promptly suspended by the Conservatives. - Faltering start - After the election announcement, Sunak travelled across the country, promoting Conservatives as the safe option. His campaign met with some early snags, including a visit to the site where the Titanic was built drawing comparisons between his leadership and captaining a sinking ship. Doubling down on older voters and right-wing supporters, Sunaks campaign has seen pledges to bring back national service and what is billed as a 2.4 billion (3 billion) tax break for pensioners. However, Sunaks week of intense campaigning and bid to surprise the country have done little to boost favour. Polls put Labour on average at 45 of voting intentions, against 23 for the Tories, suggesting that, given the simple-majority voting system, Labour will enjoy a very large win. In a bid to turn things around, Sunak is hoping to win points in the scheduled debates with Keir Starmer, the first of which is set to take place next Tuesday on ITV. - More infighting - Meanwhile Labour is seeking to capitalise on the publics weariness with the Conservatives, who have seen five prime ministers since 2016 alongside a slew of scandals and economic woes. It has tried to focus on its shift to the natural party of business after winning the backing of 120 industry leaders this week. After a resounding defeat under left-wing leader Jeremy Corbyn in 2019, Starmer has pushed the party to the centre in a bid to win back voters, including by purging Corbyn and making moves to root out anti-Semitism. However, the past week has exposed the long-standing factional splits within the party, with MP Diane Abbott expressing her dismay at the partys desire to bar her from candidacy. Starmer has insisted that the fate of Abbott, who was suspended last year for comments on racism, had not yet been decided. But the treatment meted out to the highly respected 70-year-old, who has spent 37 years as a member of parliament, has provoked fierce criticism. Starmer has also faced condemnation from leftist voters who accuse him of rolling back promises he made during his successful leadership campaign. Source: AFP --Agencies",

        "date": "May 30, 2024 10:03 am",
        "content": "The Thai cabinet has adopted multiple visa measures to stimulate tourism, which will benefit tourists from 36 more countries including Sri Lankan travelers who may have plan to stay in the kingdom for more than 30 days. From 1 June, the number of countries eligible for visa-free entry will increase from 57 to 93, with the duration of visa-free stays extended to 60 days. Newly added countries include Sri Lanka, Laos, Albania, Cambodia, China, India, Jamaica, Kazakhstan, Mexico, Morocco, Panama, Romania, Uzbekistan, and others. These measures, including new visa-free and visa-on-arrival schemes, also extended stays for students and reduced health insurance requirements for retirees. The Thai cabinet also approved visa-on-arrival for a total of 31 countries, up from the previous 19. Meanwhile, digital nomads can now obtain multiple-entry five-year visas. With this type of visa, visitors can stay for up to 180 days each time, with one extension allowed within the five-year period for stays of up to 180 days, extendable for another 180 days. Previously, these tourists were only permitted to stay for two 30-day periods. Government spokesperson Chai Watcharong emphasized that these regulations target digital nomads, remote workers, freelancers, as well as individuals keen on learning Muay Thai and Thai cuisine, with the goal of attracting them to the region. Furthermore, foreign graduates can now stay in the country for a full year after completing their studies, a significant extension from the previous requirement of immediate departure. Chai mentioned that this change facilitates job searches, especially in high-demand fields. Currently, approximately 40,000 foreign students are studying in the country. In another notable change, tourists aged 50 and above seeking long-stay visas will now only need health insurance coverage of THB 440,000 (USD 12,000), down from the previous requirement of THB 3 million (about USD 81,820). This change will come into effect in September. Additionally, the cabinet approved expanding e-visa application services at Thai consulates and embassies, increasing the number of locations from 47 to 94, starting in December. Aiming to attract over 36 million international visitors this year to drive economic growth, Thailand has already welcomed more than 14.32 million foreign tourists as of 26 May, generating over THB 682.9 billion (over USD 18 billion). After a meeting on Tuesday, Thai Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin revealed that extension of the period of visa-free stays from 30 days to 60 days will come into effect in June. The government will also increase the number of visa-free countries from 57 to 93, including Cambodia, India, Kazakhstan, Laos, etc. Countries eligible for visa arrivals will also be added from 19 to 31. --With Agencies Inputs",

        "date": "May 30, 2024 11:48 am",
        "content": "The United States will boycott a United Nations tribute on Thursday to Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi, who was killed earlier this month in a helicopter crash, a U.S. official said. The 193-member U.N. General Assembly traditionally meets to pay tribute to any world leader who was a sitting head of state at the time of their death. The tribute will feature speeches about Raisi. We wont attend this event in any capacity, a U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, told Reuters. The U.S. boycott has not previously been reported. Irans mission to the United Nations in New York declined to comment. Raisi, a hardliner who had been seen as a potential successor to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, was killed when his helicopter came down in poor weather in mountains near the Azerbaijan border on May 19. The United Nations should be standing with the people of Iran, not memorializing their decades-long oppressor, said the U.S. official. Raisi was involved in numerous, horrific human rights abuses, including the extrajudicial killings of thousands of political prisoners in 1988. Some of the worst human rights abuses on record, especially against the women and girls of Iran, took place during his tenure, the official said. The U.N. Security Council stood at the beginning of an unrelated meeting for a moment of silence on May 20 to remember the victims of the helicopter crash. Deputy U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Robert Wood reluctantly stood with his 14 counterparts. The United States expressed its official condolences for Raisis death, the State Department said on May 20. White House national security spokesperson John Kirby also said that day: No question this was a man who had a lot of blood on his hands. U.S. President Joe Bidens administration was strongly criticized by some Republican members of Congress for offering condolences to Iran. Raisi, 63, was elected president in 2021 and in office ordered a tightening of morality laws, oversaw a bloody crackdown on anti-government protests and pushed hard in nuclear talks with world powers.

        "date": "May 30, 2024 11:55 am",
        "content": "The Alcohol and Drug Information Centre (ADIC) reports that nearly 50 deaths occur daily in Sri Lanka due to smoking, totaling approximately 20,000 deaths annually. In a statement, ADIC highlighted the importance of World No Tobacco Day, observed tomorrow, May 31. The theme of World No Tobacco Day 2024 is Protecting Children from Tobacco Industry Interference. The ADIC noted that cigarette consumption among young people in Sri Lanka is rapidly decreasing, with an overall national decline of 9.1. Tobacco company reports indicate that tobacco production in the country has decreased by around 19, according to the ADIC. Despite these positive trends, ADIC states that approximately 1.5 million people in Sri Lanka still smoke tobacco. Additionally, multinational tobacco companies (MNCs) are employing various tactics to attract the younger generation and children to tobacco use, it claims. Meanwhile, a recent report by the World Health Organization (WHO) shows that globally an estimated 37 million children aged 1315 years use tobacco, and in many countries, the rate of e-cigarette use among adolescents exceeds that of adults. In the WHO European Region, 20 of 15-year-olds surveyed reported using e-cigarettes in the past 30 days. Despite significant progress in reducing tobacco use, the emergence of e-cigarettes and other new tobacco and nicotine products present a grave threat to youth and tobacco control. Studies demonstrate that e-cigarette use increases conventional cigarette use, particularly among non-smoking youth, by nearly three times, the report highlighted.",

ABC News cited a New York City Police Department bulletin, saying the tournament and its related events in New York City could be viewed by extremists as an opportunity to commit acts of violence or disruption. Recent pro-ISIS propaganda which specifically referenced the upcoming India-Pakistan match at this major event ... raises concerns and reinforces the need for heightened vigilance among security partners, the bulletin is quoted as saying by ABC News. Nassau County Police Commissioner Patrick Ryder said the World Cup received an ISIS-K-linked threat in April and more specific threats over the India versus Pakistan match. World Cup matches between India and Pakistan, which have not played a bilateral series in several years due to tense political relations, are among the most viewed sporting events in the world. Hochul said in a statement New York State Police had been directed to increase enforcement presence, surveillance and screening processes for the tournament.

        "title": "Violence clouds the last day of campaigning for Mexicos election",
        "date": "May 30, 2024 02:59 pm",
        "content": "Mexico held the last day of campaigning Wednesday before Sundays nationwide election, but the closing rallies were darkened by attacks on candidates and the countrys persistently high homicide rate. Opposition candidate Xóchitl Gálvez started her last campaign rallies early Wednesday on the outskirts of Mexico City, and she focused her ire on President Andrés Manuel López Obradors hugs not bullets policy of not confronting the drug cartels. Gálvez is facing the candidate of López Obradors Morena party, former Mexico City Mayor Claudia Sheinbaum. Sheinbaum, who leads in the race, has promised to continue all of López Obradors policies. Are we going to continue with hugs, or are we going to apply the law to criminals? Gálvez asked a cheering crowd. Mexico wants peace, wants tranquility. López Obrador has withdrawn funding for police forces and directed it to the quasi-military National Guard, which critics say lacks the professional and investigative abilities needed to fight the drug gangs. Gálvez promised to return the funding to police forces and guarantee them wages of at least 1,200 per month. Gálvez also pledged to reconcile a country that has been highly polarized by the outgoing presidents rhetoric, saying enough division, enough hatred ... we are all Mexicans. Sheinbaum held her final rally later Wednesday in Mexico Citys vast, colonial-era central square. She delivered a strongly nationalistic speech to a large crowd. Mexico is respected in the world, it is a reference point, Sheinbaum said, claiming that López Obradors government has returned to us the pride of being Mexicans. Mexico has changed, and for the better, she said. On the violence issue, Sheinbaum vowed to continue López Obradors policy of offering apprenticeships to encourage youths not to join drug cartels. We will deepen the strategy of peace and security, and the progress that has been made, she said. This is not an iron fist policy, Sheinbaum said. This is justice. While López Obrador has increased the countrys minimum wage and increased government benefit programs, he has been unable to significantly reduce the historically high homicide rate, which currently runs at more than 30,000 killings per year nationwide. That gang-fueled violence has also cast a shadow over the campaigns. Late Wednesday, a mayoral candidate in the violent southern state of Guerrero was shot to death in the town of Coyuca de Benitez. Gov. Evelyn Salgado identified the dead candidate as Alfredo Cabrera, but gave no further details on his killing. Local media reported he was shot in the head at his closing campaign event. A mayoral candidate in the western state of Jalisco was shot multiple times by intruders in his campaign offices late Tuesday. Two members of Gilberto Palomars campaign staff were also wounded, and all three were hospitalized in serious condition, according to Jalisco state security coordinator Sánchez Beruben. Mexicans will vote Sunday in an election weighing gender, democracy and populism, as they chart the countrys path forward in voting shadowed by cartel violence. With two women leading the contest, Mexico will likely elect its first female president. More than 20,000 congressional and local positions are up for grabs, according to the National Electoral Institute. Gunmen killed an alternate mayoral candidate in Morelos state, just south of Mexico City on Tuesday, state prosecutors said. Local media reported attackers on a motorcycle shot Ricardo Arizmendi five times in the head in the city of Cuautla in Morelos. Alternate candidates take office if the winner of a race is incapacitated or resigns. About 27 candidates, mostly running for mayor or town councils, have been killed so far this year. While that is not much higher than in some past elections, what is unprecedented is the mass shootings: candidates used to be killed in targeted attacks, but now criminals have taken to spraying whole campaign events with gunfire.

The death happened as the KL1341 flight was getting ready to fly to Billund, Denmark, on Wednesday afternoon. The airline said it was taking care of passengers and employees who witnessed the incident and it was investigating. Netherlands military police also said it had started an investigation. Royal Netherlands Marechaussee force added in a post on X that all passengers and employees had been removed from the flight. The deceased has not yet been identified and it is too early to say whether it was an accident or a form of suicide, a spokesperson told Reuters new agency. Various Dutch media outlets have suggested the victim could be an employee involved in pushing back an aeroplane before it takes off. Pictures obtained by Dutch national broadcaster NOS show emergency services surrounding the passenger jet on the airports apron - where aircraft are parked. According to reports, the aircraft involved was a short-haul Embraer jet used by KLMs Cityhopper service operating flights between nearby destinations within Europe.

        "date": "May 30, 2024 03:40 pm",
        "content": "An international law enforcement team has arrested a Chinese national and disrupted a major botnet that officials said he ran for nearly a decade, amassing at least 99 million in profits by reselling access to criminals who used it for identity theft, child exploitation, and financial fraud, including pandemic relief scams. The U.S. Department of Justice quoted FBI Director Christopher Wray as saying Wednesday that the 911 S5 botnet  a network of malware-infected computers in nearly 200 countries  was likely the worlds largest. Justice said in a news release that Yunhe Wang, 35, was arrested May 24. Wang was arrested in Singapore, and search warrants were executed there and in Thailand, the FBIs deputy assistant director for cyber operations, Brett Leatherman, said in a LinkedIn post. Authorities also seized 29 million in cryptocurrency, Leatherman said. Cybercriminals used Wangs network of zombie residential computers to steal billions of dollars from financial institutions, credit card issuers and accountholders, and federal lending programs since 2014, according to an indictment filed in Texas eastern district. The administrator, Wang, sold access to the 19 million Windows computers he hijacked  more than 613,000 in the United States  to criminals who used that access to commit a staggering array of crimes that victimized children, threatened peoples safety and defrauded financial institutions and federal lending programs, U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland said in announcing the takedown. He said criminals who purchased access to the zombie network from Wang were responsible for more than 5.9 billion in estimated losses due to fraud against relief programs. Officials estimated 560,000 fraudulent unemployment insurance claims originated from compromised IP addresses. Wang allegedly managed the botnet through 150 dedicated servers, half of them leased from U.S.-based online service providers. The indictment says Wang used his illicit gains to purchase 21 properties in the United States, China, Singapore, Thailand, the United Arab Emirates and St. Kitts and Nevis, where it said he obtained citizenship through investment. In its news release, the Justice Department thanked police and other authorities in Singapore and Thailand for their assistance. Source: The Associated Press --Agencies",

        "date": "May 30, 2024 03:56 pm",
        "content": "Rapper and singer Sean Kingston on Tuesday waived his right to fight extradition in a California court and agreed to be turned over to authorities in Florida, where he and his mother are charged with committing more than a million dollars worth of fraud. Kingston, 34, did not make a public court appearance but signed papers agreeing to skip extradition hearings, representatives from San Bernardino courts and sheriff told The Associated Press. He remained in a Southern California jail Tuesday afternoon, but sheriffs officials will coordinate with the Broward County Sheriffs Office to return him to Florida, sheriffs spokeswoman Mara Rodriguez said in an email. Kingston was arrested Thursday at Fort Irwin, an Army training base in Californias Mojave Desert where he was performing. His mother, 61-year-old Janice Turner, was arrested the same day, when a SWAT team raided Kingstons rented mansion in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Kingston and Turner have been charged with conducting an organized scheme to defraud, grand theft, identity theft and related crimes, according to arrest warrants released by the Broward County Sheriffs Office. The warrants allege they stole money, jewelry, a Cadillac Escalade and furniture. The Jamaican American performer had a No. 1 hit with Beautiful Girls in 2007 and collaborated with Justin Bieber on the song Eenie Meenie. Robert Rosenblatt, an attorney for Kingston and his mother, had said Friday that they planned to waive extradition, saying they looked forward to addressing the charges in a Florida court and are confident of a successful resolution. Emails sent to Rosenblatt for further comment Tuesday were not immediately answered. The warrants in the case say that from October to March they stole almost 500,000 in jewelry, more than 200,000 from Bank of America, 160,000 from the Escalade dealer, more than 100,000 from First Republic Bank, 86,000 from the maker of customized beds. Specifics were not given. Kingston, whose legal name is Kisean Anderson, was already on two years probation for trafficking stolen property. His mother pleaded guilty in 2006 to bank fraud for stealing over 160,000 and served nearly 1.5 years in prison, according to federal court records. Source: AP --Agencies",

        "title": "Israel extends control of Gazas entire land border",
        "date": "May 30, 2024 04:43 pm",
        "content": "Israels military has said it has taken control of the strategically important buffer zone along the Gaza-Egypt border known as the Philadelphi Corridor, meaning it now controls Gazas entire land border. A spokesman for the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said about 20 tunnels used by Hamas to smuggle weapons into Gaza had been found within the zone. Egyptian TV quoted sources denying this, and said Israel was trying to justify its military operation in the southern Gaza city of Rafah. The announcement comes during a period of heightened tensions with Egypt. In recent days, IDF troops established operational control on the Philadelphi Corridor, on the border between Egypt and Rafah, IDF spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said on Wednesday. He described the corridor as a lifeline for Hamas, through which the group regularly smuggled weapons into the Gaza Strip. He said troops were investigating.. and neutralizing tunnels found in the area. Mr Hagari later said in a briefing with reporters that he could not be sure that all of the tunnels crossed into Egypt, the New York Times reported. The Philadelphi Corridor is a buffer zone, only about 100m (330ft) wide in parts, which runs along the Gaza side of the 13km (8-mile) border with Egypt. Gazas only other land border is with Israel itself. Egypt has previously said it had destroyed cross-border tunnels, making any weapons smuggling impossible. And a high-level Egyptian source, quoted by Al-Qahera News, accused Israel of using these allegations to justify continuing the operation on the Palestinian city of Rafah and prolonging the war for political purposes. Israel has insisted that it must take Rafah to achieve victory in the war triggered by Hamass unprecedented attack on the country on 7 October, during which about 1,200 people were killed and 252 others were taken hostage. At least 36,170 people have been killed across Gaza since the start of the conflict, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Tensions between Egypt and Israel have heightened since Israeli forces took control of the Gazan side of the Rafah crossing point three weeks ago as part of their offensive against Hamas. Earlier this week, an Egyptian soldier was killed in an incident involving Egyptian and Israeli troops in the border area near Rafah. Egypt is a strong supporter of the Palestinians and has condemned Israels military campaign in Gaza and the killing of thousands of civilians by Israel in the war. Like Israel, Egypt has maintained a blockade on its border with Gaza since Hamas came to power in 2006. Hamas is an off-shoot of the Islamist Muslim Brotherhood organisation, which is banned as a terrorist group in Egypt. Egypt has, however, kept channels open with Hamas and has been acting as a mediator in on-off indirect talks between Israel and the group to try to reach a ceasefire deal and release of Israeli hostages held by Hamas in Gaza.

        "date": "May 30, 2024 05:22 pm",
        "content": "The Committee on Public Finance (CoPF) has directed the officials of the Welfare Benefits Board to prioritise the criteria that can be verified and determined in order to accurately identify poverty while selecting the Aswesuma beneficiaries. Drawing examples, the committee pointed out that individual poverty can be identified better based on the electricity bill amount considering the electricity units consumed in each home, the Parliamentary Communications Department said in a statement. The committee pointed out that there are major problems and lack of formality in the criteria used in the selection of Aswesuma beneficiaries, and advised them to rectify it as soon as possible. The officials of the Ministry of Finance told the committee that they will change the method of giving points that is currently used in the selection of relief beneficiaries. The matter was taken up for discussion when the Committee on Public Finance met in Parliament recently (28) under the chairmanship of Dr. Harsha de Silva, the statement mentioned. Furthermore, the amendment to the regulations under section 27 of the Welfare Benefits Act No. 24 of 2002 published in the Extraordinary Gazette No. 238202 dated 29.04.2024 was considered before the Committee. The members of the committee pointed out the way in which huge corruption and irregularities take place through the manual recording of data by those people while selecting the beneficiaries. Accordingly, the Committee on Public Finance gave a recommendation to the Ministry of Finance officials to conduct the entire process from collecting necessary data to the selection of relief beneficiaries only via electronic means, it added. Furthermore, the displeasure of the committee was expressed for not taking formal legal action for the irregularities that have arisen in relation to the selection of beneficiaries. The Committee pointed out that by not taking legal action, more and more corruption and irregularities will occur and it will create a serious obstacle for the right people to get the benefits. Accordingly, the Committee Chair instructed the officials to investigate the complaints received and take necessary legal measures for the same. Additionally, the order was reconsidered under Section 3 of the Port and Airport Development Tax Act No. 18 of 2011 published in the Extraordinary Gazette No. 2350-45 dated 21.9.2023. Milk powder prices and local milk powder market were discussed under this. The Chair emphasized the importance of introducing a price formula for milk powder based on a scientific method. Accordingly, the Chair also instructed the officials to introduce the HHI (Herfindahl-Hirschman index) index, it added. Members of Parliament Rauff Hakeem, Johnston Fernando, M. A. Sumanthiran, Mahindananda Aluthgamage, Nimal Lanza, Madhura Withanage, Mayantha Dissanayake, and other government officials were present at this Committee meeting held, according to the Parliamentary Communications Department.",

        "content": "State Minister for Finance, Shehan Semasinghe stated that only those wishing to plunge the country back into an economic crisis would oppose the Economic Transformation Bill. He emphasized that while the current government is focused on an optimistic economic outlook, the opposition groups are driven solely by political motives. State Minister Semasinghe made these remarks during a press conference at the Presidential Media Centre today (30), themed Collective path to a stable country. State Minister for Finance Shehan Semasinghe, further stated, The Economic Transformation Bill aims to increase productivity and ensure equal opportunities for all citizens in Sri Lanka, while also enhancing infrastructure. It is expected to generate job opportunities, foster economic growth, and expand the competitive market through innovative exports. However, some individuals, lacking understanding of the bill, are making various claims. Opposition to the bill, according to some, comes from those wishing to plunge the country back into an economic crisis, alleging that its goals are unattainable. While the current government remains optimistic about the countrys economic prospects, opposition groups are driven purely by political motives. It is well-known that the absence of a targeted legal framework has contributed to our economic decline, a lesson we must heed. The bill proposes reducing the countrys debt burden from 128 of the Gross Domestic Product in 2022 to 95 by 2032. Similarly, the governments gross money supply, which was 34.6 in 2022, should be reduced to 13 by 2032. The foreign debt servicing ratio, 9.6 in 2022, is targeted to drop to 4.5 by 2027. We are committed to embedding these goals into the countrys legal framework to establish a sustainable economy. Additionally, the bill aims to achieve an economic growth rate exceeding 5 after 2027, recovering from a decline to -7.8 in 2022. Unemployment, which was 4.7 in 2022, is expected to be maintained below 5 by 2025. Moreover, in 2022, the labour force participation rate for women was 32.1. Our goal is to increase this to at least 40 by 2030 and 50 by 2040. Additionally, the current account balance, which was at -1.9 in 2022, is targeted to be maintained at 1 by 2025. The export of goods and services, which was 21 in 2022, will be increased to 40 by 2025 and 60 by 2040 through the Economic Transformation Act. Foreign direct investment, which was 1.6 in 2022, is expected to reach at least 5 by 2030. Our aim is to make direct investment account for 40 of the countrys exports of goods and services by 2030. The primary balance of our country is a key factor in the International Monetary Funds economic stabilization program. We aim to shift the primary balance from -3.7 in 2022 to 2.3 by 2025 and maintain it at 2 beyond 2032. Additionally, government revenue, which was 8.3 of GDP in 2022, is targeted to exceed 15 by 2025. This increase will ensure the uninterrupted provision of essential services to the people. Moreover, the reform process has heightened the impact on poor and vulnerable populations. Our goal is to reduce multidimensional poverty to below 15 by 2027 and to 10 by 2035. It is the governments responsibility to implement the necessary reforms and programs outlined in the Economic Transformation Act, and we are committed to fulfilling this mandate without hesitation.",
