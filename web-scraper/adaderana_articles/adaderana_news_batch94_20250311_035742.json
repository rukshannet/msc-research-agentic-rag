        "title": "Biden hopes for ceasefire in days as Israelis, Hamas take part in Qatar talks",
        "date": "February 27, 2024 07:48 am",
        "content": "(Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden said on Monday he hopes to have a ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas conflict in Gaza start by next Monday as the warring parties appeared to close in on a deal during negotiations in Qatar that also aim to broker the release of hostages. The presence of both sides for so-called proximity talks - meeting mediators separately but in the same city - suggested negotiations were further along than at any time since a big push at the start of February, when Israel rejected a Hamas counter-offer for a four-and-a-half-month truce. Biden said he hoped a ceasefire would start within days. Well I hope by the beginning of the weekend, by the end of the weekend, he said, when asked when he expected a ceasefire to start. My national security adviser tells me that were close. Were close. Were not done yet. My hope is by next Monday well have a ceasefire, Biden told reporters during a visit to New York. A U.S. official said U.S. negotiators had been pushing hard to get a pause-for-hostages deal by Ramadans beginning on March 10 and top U.S. officials were working on the issue last week. The optimism appeared to grow out of meetings between the Israelis and Qataris, the official said. In public, Israel and Hamas continued to take positions far apart on a possible truce, while blaming each other for delays. After meeting Qatari Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, Ismail Haniyeh, the reclusive head of Hamas, said his group had embraced efforts to find an end to the war, and accused Israel of stalling while Gazans die under siege. We will not allow the enemy to use negotiations as a cover for this crime, he said. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel was ready for a deal, and it was up to Hamas to drop demands he described as from another planet. Obviously, we want this deal if we can have it. It depends on Hamas. Its really now their decision, he told U.S. network Fox News. They have to come down to reality. Al Thanis office said Al Thani and the Hamas chief had discussed Qatars efforts to broker an immediate and permanent ceasefire agreement in the Gaza Strip. A source told Reuters earlier that an Israeli working delegation had flown to Qatar to create an operational centre to support negotiations. Its mission would include vetting proposed Palestinian militants that Hamas wants freed in a hostage release deal, the source said. Israel continues to maintain in public that it will not end the war until Hamas is eradicated, while Hamas says it will not free hostages without an agreement to end the war. Were totally committed to wipe Hamas off the face of the Earth, Israels economy and industry minister, Nir Barkat, told Reuters at a conference in the United Arab Emirates, where his presence signalled Israels continued acceptance by Arab states that has angered Palestinian militants. Senior Hamas official Sami Abu Zuhri told Reuters on Monday any ceasefire agreement would require securing an end to the aggression, the withdrawal of the occupation, the returning of the displaced, the entry of aid, shelter equipment, and rebuilding. Israel is under pressure from its main ally the United States to agree on a truce soon, to head off a threatened assault on Rafah, the city in southern Gaza where over half the enclaves 2.3 million people are sheltering, which Washington fears could become a bloodbath. WELL GO IN Netanyahu insisted an assault on Rafah was still planned, and Israel had a plan to evacuate civilians from harms way. Asked if Israel would attack even if Washington asked it not to, Netanyahu said: Well, well go in. We make our own decisions, obviously, but well go in based on the idea of having also the evacuation of the civilians. The momentum behind talks appears to have grown since Friday, when Israeli officials discussed terms of a hostage release deal in Paris with delegations from the United States, Egypt and Qatar, though not Hamas. Since Hamas killed 1,200 people and captured 253 hostages on Oct. 7, Israel has launched an all-out ground assault on Gaza, with nearly 30,000 people confirmed killed, according to Gaza health authorities. In a development that could have an impact on longer-term negotiations, the prime minister of the Palestinian Authority, which exerts limited civil control in parts of the West Bank, stepped down on Monday. Mohammad Shtayyeh said he was resigning to allow for the formation of a broad consensus among Palestinians about political arrangements following the Gaza war. The PA, recognised by the West as the official representative of Palestinians, lost control of Gaza to Hamas in 2007. Washington has called for reforms to the PA as part of an overall solution to govern Palestinian territories including Gaza after the war. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "date": "February 27, 2024 11:17 am",
        "content": "Dozens of people have been shot dead at a mosque on the same day that a church was attacked, say the authorities in Burkina Faso. It was during early-morning prayers that the gunmen surrounded the mosque in Natiaboani town. The victims were all Muslims, most of them men, a local resident told the AFP news agency. More than a third of Burkina Faso is currently under the control of Islamist insurgents. The attackers are suspected to be Islamist fighters who also targeted soldiers and a self-defence militia stationed locally that same day. Local media describe (in French) a huge invasion by hundreds of machine gun-wielding militants on motorbikes. Unverified reports on social media suggest the death toll from the mosque attack could be much higher than the count given by officials. Natiaboani, where those attacks happened, is in Burkina Fasos troubled eastern region where multiple armed groups operate. That same day, at least 15 worshippers were killed in an attack on a Catholic church during Sunday mass in Essakane in the countrys north-east. A church official said suspected Islamist militants were to blame. No link has been formally made between the two attacks, but Burkina Fasos privately owned LObservateur Paalga newspaper has questioned whether they were part of a coordinated plot. Attacks on religious figures are not uncommon in Burkina Faso. A priest who was kidnapped from the northern town of Djibo five years ago is still missing. And in 2021, the main imam of the same town of Djibo was kidnapped by armed men and found dead days later. Humanitarian workers say Burkina Faso is one of the worlds most-neglected crises. Years of rampant insecurity has forced more than two million people from their homes, and the UN estimates that a quarter of all children under five have stunted growth resulting from hunger. The military seized power two years ago promising to win the battle against insurgents but the violence continues. Source: BBC -Agencies",

        "content": "Palestinian Islamist group Hamas has received a draft proposal from Gaza truce talks in Paris which includes a 40-day pause in all military operations and the exchange of Palestinian prisoners for Israeli hostages at a ratio of 10 to one, a senior source close to the talks told Reuters on Tuesday. Under the proposed ceasefire, hospitals and bakeries in Gaza would be repaired, 500 aid trucks would enter into the strip each day and thousands of tents and caravans would be delivered to house the displaced, the source said. The draft also states Hamas would free 40 Israeli hostages including women, children under 19, elderly over 50 and the sick, while Israeli would release around 400 Palestinian prisoners and will not re-arrest them, the source told Reuters. The Gaza truce talks appear to be the most serious push in weeks to halt the fighting in the battered Palestinian enclave and secure the release of Israeli and foreign hostages. Mediators have ramped up efforts to secure a ceasefire in Gaza, in the hope of heading off an Israeli assault on the Gaza city of Rafah where more than a million displaced people are sheltering at the southern edge of the enclave. U.S. President Joe Biden said Israel has agreed not to engage in military activities during Ramadan in the Gaza Strip, which is expected to begin on the evening of March 10th, 2024, and end on the evening of April 9th, 2024. Biden, whose remarks were recorded on Monday and broadcast on NBCs Late Night with Seth Meyers on Tuesday, said Israel had committed to make it possible for Palestinians to evacuate from Rafah in Gazas south before intensifying its campaign there to destroy Hamas. After Hamas killed 1,200 people and captured 253 hostages on Oct. 7, Israel launched a ground assault on Gaza, with nearly 30,000 people confirmed killed, according to Gaza health authorities.

The embassy has assured that all required facilities would be provided to Sagara Lakshman who sustained critical injuries after being shot by a customer over a delayed food order. Meanwhile, the Minister of Labour and Foreign Employment, Manusha Nanayakkara has instructed the SLBFE authorities to look into the matter and take necessary measures without delay. The 44-year-old, originally from Rajanganaya, faced the harrowing incident on January 11 in Al Jahra city where he was residing. According to his account of the event, the initial location details given by the customer were wrong, and as a result, he had to drive to a different location to complete the delivery. However, the customer in question, agitated by the delay, had opened fire when Thilakaratne arrived at his doorstep, leaving him with serious injuries to the abdomen. After being shot, Lakshman had reportedly driven his car back with blood gushing out from the wounds and contacted an Indian acquaintance who rushed him to the hospital. Lakshman, who is the father of two daughters aged 10 and 13, earlier urged respective authorities to help him seek justice and take necessary measures to repatriate him to Sri Lanka. The SLBFE said Lakshman was treated at a hospital in Jabriya where he underwent surgery to extract the bullets. The embassy officials including the Sri Lankan ambassador to Kuwait have visited Lakshman at the hospital to check in on his condition. As per reports, the Kuwaiti national who shot Lakshman is now under arrest on attempted murder charges. The SLBFE asserted that all necessary measures would be taken to repatriate Lakshman, based on the progress of the ongoing legal proceedings. His hospital expenses have been borne by the restaurant where he is employed, the Bureau said further.",

        "title": "India to push rupee investments in Sri Lanka - report",
        "date": "February 27, 2024 06:56 pm",
        "content": "The Indian government is working on operationalizing Rupee investments in Sri Lanka in a move to boost Indian investments in its southern neighbour, two people aware of the matter told Mint. Rupee investments will ease the way for Indian firms to enter the Sri Lankan markets, the people mentioned above said, speaking under the condition of anonymity. During FY 2023, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) allowed invoicing and payments for international trade in the Indian Rupee. This allowed exports and imports to be denominated and invoiced in Indian rupees, with the settlement of trade transactions taking place in the currency. The RBIs decision is aimed at promoting the growth of global trade, especially Indian exports, apart from systematically internationalizing the currency. India wants the Indian Rupee to be a hard currency in the future, the second person mentioned above said. Last year, Sri Lanka notified the Indian Rupee as a designated currency, which enabled trade between the two countries to be settled in the currency and also allowed tourists visiting the island-nation to use the currency for transactions. India now hopes to work with Sri Lankan to make it easier for Indian firms to invest in the island nation. At present, Indian investors invest in the country through international currencies like the dollar, which is more cumbersome and involves conversion costs, said one of the persons cited above. Rupee investments will ease the way for Indian firms to enter the Sri Lankan markets. The ministry of external affairs (MEA), in particular, is learnt to be pushing for this change, the person added. Spokespersons of Indias MEA, finance ministry and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) didnt respond to emailed queries. India has built a closer economic relationship with Sri Lanka in recent years. India is a key partner of Sri Lanka, playing a pivotal role in its recovery from the economic crisis that started in 2019 and threatened to derail the economy of the South Asian nation. The crisis that peaked in 2022-23 saw spiralling inflation, emptying of foreign exchange reserves, and shortages of basic commodities. While the IMF extended assistance of 3 billion, India gave an assistance of over 4 billion to Sri Lanka aiding its economic recovery. Indias financial assistance included credit lines, a currency swap arrangement and deferred import payments. India and Sri Lanka also unveiled a slew of connectivity initiatives during President Ranil Wickremesinghes visit to India last July. These include proposals for a petroleum pipeline, power grid linkages, a land bridge and a comprehensive Economic and Technology Cooperation Agreement (ETCA). On 19 February, Mint reported that the ETCA deal is expected to be finalized in FY25, with negotiations in advanced stages. Pushing for rupee investments will also aid Indian firms, which have made high-profile investments in Sri Lanka, the person mentioned above said. Major Indian corporate houses have invested in Sri Lanka. For instance, the Adani Group is developing the West Container Terminal in Colombo Port, for which it received 553 million from the US governments Development Finance Corporation (DFC). The group is also considering a 750 million initial investment in Sri Lankas power sector, according to reports. There is a vision to make Indian currency into a hard currency in the coming years, which will enable it to become a part of the IMFs SDR (special drawing rights) basket, and allow it to be held as a foreign exchange reserve, the second person said.

        "content": "Cabinet approval has been granted to implement a project funded by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to provide credit facilities at concessional interest rates to existing micro, small and medium-scale enterprises (MSMEs) in Sri Lanka for further expansion and recovery of their businesses. The government said a significant number of small and medium-scale entrepreneurs involved in manufacturing, import, export, tourism, apparel and various other commercial operations have found it very difficult to continue running their enterprises as a result of the economic downturn and the impact of external factors beyond their control. The Asian Development Bank has agreed to provide working capital support for the small and medium enterprise sector as a relief, the Government Info. Department said. The proposed program is intended to provide credit facilities to existing micro, small and medium-scale enterprises for further expansion and recovery of their businesses through licensed commercial banks and licensed specialized banks at concessional interest rates. Rs. 20 billion will be spent on the entire project which has two components. Out of this, Rs. 15 billion rupees will be used to strengthen existing and new enterprises and the remaining amount of Rs. 05 billion will be used to support enterprises under the non-performing loan category. Accordingly, the Cabinet of Ministers approved the proposal presented by the President, in his capacity as the Minister of Finance, Economic Stabilization and National Policies, to implement the said project, the statement said.",

        "date": "February 27, 2024 09:39 pm",
        "content": "Dr. Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe, the Minister of Justice, Prisons Affairs and Constitutional Reforms on Tuesday (Feb.27) disclosed plans to introduce an amendment concerning the temporary suspension of Parate execution, indicating its imminent presentation to Parliament. This proposed legislative change signifies a proactive approach towards addressing legal matters crucial for the countrys governance and justice system, he added. Furthermore, Minister Rajapakshe highlighted the anticipation of implementing a distinct loan scheme tailored specifically for Small and Midsize Enterprises (SMEs). This initiative aims to bolster the economic prospects of smaller businesses, contributing to overall economic resilience and growth. The lawmaker unveiled these during a press briefing held at the Presidential Media Centre (PMC), focused on the pivotal theme of Collective Path to a Stable Country. Through this platform, he emphasizes the governments steadfast dedication to advancing legal reforms and providing support to SMEs, thus affirming its commitment to national progress and prosperity. Addressing the media briefing Dr. Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe further said; A nations fiscal policy is integral to its economic strength. The central bank holds significant authority in shaping this policy landscape. Reflecting on discussions surrounding Parate execution in Sri Lanka, it becomes apparent that the central banks focus primarily centered on safeguarding the stability of financial institutions. However, concerns have been raised regarding whether sufficient attention has been paid to the countrys overall balance sheet, especially amidst declines in the agricultural sector from 22 to 8 and the industrial sector from 38 to 32. Despite borrowing from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on 17 occasions, the economy has struggled to regain its footing. A notable trend has been the continuous expansion of the service sector at the expense of neglecting the industrial sector, resulting in decreased production capacity. This imbalance has impeded the nations economic recovery and overall growth trajectory. The staggering amount of loans extended by two state banks, totalling approximately Rs. 602 billion, presents a daunting challenge. Much of this sum is destined to be written off as bad debt due to non-payment. Had these funds been allocated towards agriculture and industry, significant strides in growth could have been achieved. This predicament underscores the necessity for stringent financial controls within the country to ensure optimal utilization of resources and sustainable economic development. To prevent crises for businesses and financial institutions, proactive measures are essential. Therefore, steps must be taken to alleviate the challenges associated with Parate execution. Plans are underway to propose amendments to Parliament regarding Parate execution to address these concerns. Additionally, a separate loan scheme tailored for Small and Midsize Enterprises (SMEs) is on the agenda, with President Ranil Wickremesinghe lending his support to this initiative. Furthermore, the government aims to implement a low-interest loan program for SMEs, collaborating with key financial institutions like the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank. Recognizing the importance of responsible lending, discussions with the Cabinet have led to the decision to establish a monitoring system for credit facilities. Future deliberations with the Ministry of Finance are also anticipated to refine these strategies further. --PMD",

        "date": "February 28, 2024 09:37 am",
        "content": "Leading a significant drive to improve public governance and service delivery, Indias National Centre for Good Governance (NCGG) in Mussoorie has commenced the second phase of its capacity building program for senior civil servants from the Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka. Hosted from February 26 to March 08, this initiative attends to the enduring partnership between India and Sri Lanka in the realm of administrative reforms and governance enhancement. The programme is being attended by 40 elite civil servants from Sri Lanka, encompassing a wide array of positions such as Directors, Deputy Directors, Divisional Secretaries, and Assistant Divisional Secretaries, among others. This follows the inaugural executive batch successfully conducted from February 12 - 17, where the Sri Lankan team was led by Anura Dissanayaka, Secretary to the Prime Minister of Sri Lanka. This concerted effort fosters governance excellence and administrative efficiency through cross-border knowledge exchange and skill development. V. Srinivas, the Director General of NCGG and Secretary of the Department of Administrative Reforms and Public Grievances (DARPG), introduced the operational ethos of NCGG, emphasizing its pivotal role since its inception in driving governance innovations. Highlighting the decade-long journey of governance reforms from 2014 to 2024, Srinivas detailed Indias strides in digital governance, public grievance redressal systems, and e-governance platforms such as E-Unnat, Nivesh Mistra, and Seva Sindhu. These initiatives, aimed at realizing the vision of Maximum Governance  Minimum Government, have contributed to narrowing the gap between the government and citizens, with an aim to achieve transparency, responsiveness, and an efficient administrative framework. The programmes curriculum, designed by AP Singh, Associate Professor and Course Coordinator at NCGG, covers an expansive range of topics. These include land acquisition reforms, digital technologys role in governance, disaster management with a focus on coastal resilience, public-private partnerships, and the transformative Swamitva scheme, among others. The inclusion of field visits to renowned Indian institutions and cultural landmarks like the Taj Mahal offers participants tangible insights into Indias governance models and societal fabric. An integral component of the program is fostering institutional collaboration between NCGG and the Sri Lanka Institute of Development Administration (SLIDA), aiming to create a sustainable framework for bilateral cooperation in governance and public administration. This initiative renders to the NCGGs global commitment, having extended its capacity building programs to civil servants from 17 countries, thus positioning itself as a beacon of excellence in governance and public policy training on the international stage. The convergence of Sri Lankan civil servants at NCGG not only represents a platform for learning and exchange but also signifies the shared aspirations of India and Sri Lanka towards enhancing public administration and governance. As the programme unfolds, it promises to equip these leaders with next-generation skills and insights, enabling them to drive transformative changes within their respective domains. This collaboration is a step forward in strengthening bilateral ties, developing a spirit of mutual learning, and contributing to the broader goal of governance excellence across borders.

Instead, the Democrats want former first lady Michelle Obama to replace him as the partys frontrunner. The poll survey data released by Rasmussen Reports on Monday (Feb 26) shows that about 48 per cent of Democrats approve of the party finding another candidate to replace Joe Biden before the election in November, compared to 38 per cent who disapprove. However, only 33 per cent believe that such a ballot shakeup, this late in the presidential campaign was likely to happen. The poll conducted on 960 voters found little consensus on who should replace Biden on the ballot but Obama, 60, led with 20 per cent of respondents voting for her. She emerged as the leading candidate amongst the likes of Vice President Kamala Harris, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, California Gov. Gavin Newsom, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, none of the above and not sure. A difficult climb for Biden At least 12 per cent of Democrats said they were game for a possible rematch of the 2016 presidential race when Clinton squared up against Trump. Notably, Republican Senator Ted Cruz had argued in September last year that Obama might be parachuted in at the Democratic National Convention and announced as the partys nominee for president in place of Biden. Despite Obamas repeated insistence that she wants to remain away from politics, her name keeps popping up - leading to routine speculations. Also read  Hypocrisy?

The petitioning companies claimed that despite having submitted all required documents to the respondents for the transfer of 50.23 state-owned shares in SLT and 51.34 shares in Lanka Hospitals, the Cabinet sub-committee assigned to the restructuring of State-Owned Enterprises rejected the said applications for no apparent reason. Thus, the companies noted that the committees decision to reject their applications is not only arbitrary and unfair, but also unlawful, given that they had fulfilled all pre-requisites. Upon consideration of these facts, Appellate Court Judge D. N. Samarakoon issued a notice for the respondents named in the petitions, including President Ranil Wickremesinghe, in his capacity as the Minister of Finance, Economic Stabilisation and National Policies, and State Minister of Finance Shehan Semasinghe, members of the Cabinet sub-committee appointed for the restructuring of public enterprises and the Attorney General, to appear before the court on 12 March to present their submissions.",

        "title": "South Koreas fertility rate dropped to fresh record low in 2023",
        "date": "February 28, 2024 01:22 pm",
        "content": "South Koreas fertility rate, already the worlds lowest, dropped to a fresh record low in 2023, defying the billions of dollars spent by the country to try to reverse the trend as the population shrank for a fourth straight year. The average number of expected babies for a South Korean woman during her reproductive life fell to 0.72 from 0.78 in 2022, data from Statistics Korea showed on Wednesday. That is far below the rate of 2.1 per woman needed for a steady population and well behind the rate of 1.24 in 2015 when concerns about issues such as the cost of housing and education were lower. Since 2018, South Korea has been the only Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD) member with a rate below 1, defying the billions of dollars spent by the country to try to reverse the trend that led the population to decline for a fourth straight year in 2023. Having a baby is on my list, but theres windows for promotions and I dont want to be passed over, said Gwak Tae-hee, 34, a junior manager at a Korean dairy product maker who has been married for three years. Gwak had considered starting in vitro fertilisation (IVF) treatment last year to try to have a baby, but ended up volunteering for work projects to improve her career prospects. I dont know about elsewhere but working two or three days a week doesnt get you anywhere in Korean companies. I hope its not too late when I try next year or the year after, Gwak said. South Koreas demographic crisis has become the top risk to economic growth and the social welfare system, with the countrys population of 51 million on track to halve by the end of this century. South Korea has previously projected its fertility rate is likely to fall further to 0.68 in 2024. The capital Seoul, which has the countrys highest housing costs, had the lowest fertility rate of 0.55 last year. Ahead of elections in April, South Koreas major political parties vowed more public housing and easier loans to encourage childbirth, aiming to allay fears of national extinction as fertility rates crumble. Being married is seen as a prerequisite to having children in South Korea, but marriages are also declining in the country. There are people who dont get married but we think about why married couples choose not to have babies, and my understanding is that addressing that part is going to be the focus of our policies (to boost the birth rate), an official at Statistics Korea told a briefing, without elaborating. The parties focus on population in their election planks reflects growing alarm after spending of more than 360 trillion won (270 billion) in areas such as childcare subsidies since 2006 has failed to reverse record low fertility rates. South Korea is not alone in the region struggling with a rapidly ageing population. Neighbouring Japan said on Tuesday the number of babies born in 2023 fell for an eighth straight year to a fresh record low. Japans fertility rate hit a record low of 1.26 in 2022, while China recorded 1.09, also a record low. Source: Reuters -Agencies",

        "date": "February 28, 2024 01:28 pm",
        "content": "Sri Lankas Foreign Affairs Minister Ali Sabry has urged the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) to refrain from allowing short-term political gains or domestic vote bank politics to overtake the work of the Council. Addressing the High-Level segment of the 55th Session of the council through a pre-recorded video statement on 27 February, the Minister highlighted that despite the severe constraints faced by the country, Sri Lanka continued to engage actively and constructively with an extensive array of helpful working methods of the council, that are productive and beneficial to the people. Foreign Minister Sabry reiterated Sri Lankas rejection of the UNHRC Resolutions 461 and 511 and the external evidence gathering mechanism established by these resolutions, while emphasizing that such mechanisms are counterproductive and unhelpful and contradict the founding principles of the council. He also provided an overview of the tangible progress made by the country with regard to economic recovery, national unity and reconciliation and added that the cornerstone of this recovery lies in pragmatic policy decisions that prioritize the countrys welfare over short-term political gains. The significant progress achieved in this regard has been recognized and welcomed both locally and internationally, he stated. While stating that the councils approach to the humanitarian crisis in Gaza will be another litmus test to its credibility, Minister Sabry urged the council to prioritize de-politicization, constructive dialogue, and multilateral cooperation while avoiding double standards. The 55th Session of the council takes place in Geneva from 26 February  5 April 2024, during which the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights will present an oral update on Sri Lanka on 04 March, as mandated by the HRC Resolution 511. Sri Lankas Permanent Representative to the UN in Geneva Himalee Arunatilaka will deliver Sri Lankas statement as the country concerned following the oral update by the High Commissioner.",

        "date": "February 28, 2024 02:32 pm",
        "content": "International Monetary Fund chief Kristalina Georgieva on Tuesday said she wants to shine a spotlight on the timelines and predictability of debt restructuring processes at the next meeting of the Global Sovereign Debt Roundtable in April. Georgieva told Reuters she hoped to make progress on the issue when the roundtable  which includes debtor countries and official and private creditors  meet in Washington in April during the spring meetings of the IMF and the World Bank. Do we see scope for improvement? Yes. And we would like to use the next Global Sovereign Debt Roundtable in the spring to talk about predictability and timelines, because this is where the biggest difficulty for the debtor countries is, she said in an interview before a meeting in Brazil of finance officials from the Group of 20 major economies. Everything takes much longer than countries need and expect, she said. Georgieva declined to give specific timelines, but said panel participants would work to define specific steps in a debt restructuring process and then set a maximum time for completing that step. Despite long delays in ongoing debt restructuring processes, Georgieva said she saw some progress, noting that Zambia was in the final steps of its agreement with creditors and Ghana was also making progress, as were countries like Sri Lanka that were not covered by the G20 Common Framework. Other countries that needed restructuring but had not asked for restructuring under the Common Framework, like Malawi, were seeing improved conditions and constructive engagement by China, the worlds largest sovereign creditor. The financial conditions globally were also improving, she said, noting that Ivory Coast and Benin and others were seeing better conditions on markets than before. The goal now was to build on the engagement of key creditors and make this engagement more productive. Source  Reuters - Agencies",

        "date": "February 28, 2024 02:42 pm",
        "content": "A teenager of Sri Lankan origin took his own life after he was blackmailed on Snapchat over nude photographs, a UK inquest has heard. Dinal De Alwis, 16, represented Whitgift School, Croydon, at rugby and football and hoped to study economics at Cambridge after achieving straight As in all his GCSE subjects. Dinal killed himself in October 2022 days after he returned from a family holiday in Majorca over the autumn half-term break. He left his home at 2 a.m. and was seen on CCTV falling to his death an hour later. South London Coroners Court heard that the teenager recorded a video outlining he planned to kill himself after he received two nude photographs of himself from a blackmailer on social media. The blackmailer demanded that Dinal pay 100 to stop sending the images to his followers. Dinals family say they believe a girl may have taken the images with Dinal before they ended up in the wrong hands. An inquest into Dinals death heard the blackmailer, who is understood to have targeted other victims, wrote: So you think blocking me can stop me? What do you want me to do  you want me to send it to all of your followers? Why cant you just pay me? 100? The inquest heard that a Met Police investigation found that Dinal had received messages in the hours before his death. They came from a man who detectives believe was probably based in Nigeria but who was using a virtual private network (VPN) to mask his location. Dinals father, Kaushallya De Alwis, told the inquest his son had not shown any signs of unhappiness but believed he wanted to avoid the shame of the photographs going public. He told the court how he was proud his son was proficient in English after the family moved from Sri Lanka and described him as brave and caring. The hearing was told that Dinal was a strong sportsman at Whitgift School, where England rugby players Danny Cipriani and Elliot Daly are among the sporting alumni. He achieved straight A grades in his GCSEs. Talking about his death, Mr De Alwis said the fact his son had taken his own life after he was blackmailed was incredibly painful and showed the world is so cruel. The inquest ruled that Dinal died as a result of suicide. Police did not establish exactly how the suspect managed to get hold of the photographs. It is still a big question mark, Mr De Alwis said. Last year, a report from the US based Network Contagion Research Institute, found male teenagers from Western English-speaking countries are increasingly targeted by blackmail attacks carried out by Nigeria-based cybercriminals. The majority of these happen on social media platforms like TikTok, Snapchat, Instagram, and Wizz. There must be ways of tracking these things Speaking to the Daily Mail on Sunday night, Mr De Alwis said he did not want other families to experience similar tragedies and called for parents to be allowed access to their childrens social media accounts. He told the newspaper: Dinal had had some girlfriends, hed been very open with me  Id warned him to be careful. The grieving is never-ending. Im very worried about my younger son  hes big time into all this social media, and young people underestimate the dangers around them. There must be ways of tracking these things and parents should have access. I dont want this to happen to anyone else. Snapchat said the app had a pop-up warning for users if they were added by someone they did not know. A spokesman said: Any sexual exploitation of young people is abhorrent and our hearts go out to the family and friends of the victim in this case. We work in multiple ways to detect and prevent this type of abuse and work with police to support investigations. We have extra protections for under-18s including a special reporting category if someone is threatening to share sexual content. Our Family Centre also allows parents to see who their teens are talking to.

        "date": "February 28, 2024 03:16 pm",
        "content": "Apple has canceled work on its electric car, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters on Tuesday, a decade after the iPhone maker kicked off the project. Shares of the company were up 0.7 in afternoon trading, having pared some losses from earlier in the trading day. Several employees working on the electric car project will be shifted to the firms artificial intelligence (AI) division, according to Bloomberg News, which first reported the development. If it is true, Apple will put more focus on GenAI and that should give investors more optimism about the companys efforts and ability to compete at a platform level on AI, said Ben Bajarin, chief executive of consulting firm Creative Strategies. Apple has so far held back from any big moves in AI, in stark contrast to other tech giants such as Alphabet and Microsoft, which have first-mover advantage in incorporating the breakthrough technology. Apple declined to comment. High interest rates to tame inflation have soured consumer sentiment and led to a slowdown in demand for usually pricier electric vehicles, prompting the industry to cut jobs and reduce production. Several major automakers, including EV market leader Tesla, have decided to pull back on investments, with some shifting plans to focus on hybrids instead of fully battery-powered cars. Apple kicked off Project Titan, as its car effort was known internally, a decade ago, as a wave of interest in self-driving vehicles swept through Silicon Valley. Reuters reported in 2020 that Apple was considering releasing a vehicle as soon as 2024 or 2025. But progress had been uneven even before the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted the global automotive industry. Apple had laid off 190 workers from the group in 2019 after revamping its software approach. The design of the concept car also changed, from a radical, steering-wheel-free autonomous vehicle that would have been a departure from traditional automotive design, to a more conventional car with advanced driver-assistance features.

Accordingly, the SLFP announced that it will support the motion being brought against the Speaker by the opposition, and will vote in favour of it. On Monday (26 Feb.), several Opposition members, led by Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) Leader Sajith Premadasa, signed a motion of no confidence against the Speaker, claiming that he had violated the Constitution. As such, a group of MPs belonging to the opposition in Parliament including M. A. Sumanthiran, Lakshman Kiriella, Prof. G. L. Pieris, Tissa Attanayake, Chandima Weerakkody and Shan Wijayalal de Silva, had inked the motion for approving the much-disputed Online Safety Bill amidst irregular procedures. The no-confidence motion pointed out that the Speaker had ignored the Supreme Courts recommendations pertaining to Sections 13, 17, 20, 33 (6), 34 (1), 35 (1), 21, 22 and 33 of the Online Safety Bill. Earlier this month, Opposition Leader charged that the Speaker had ignored nine recommendations given by the Supreme Court while enacting the Online Safety Act, adding that they no longer have faith in him.",

The state minister said he believes the second review for the third disbursement under the extended fund facility will be carried out across a period of around two weeks. The second review will commence from the 7th of March and we are very confident that will be a smoother review than the first review. Because the first review, it was the initial stages of the implementation of the policy decisions the government had taken, he told reporters, during a press briefing at the Presidential Media Center on Wednesday (28). The progress in meeting key commitments under the IMF-supported program is set to be formally assessed in the context of the second review of the EFF arrangement alongside the forthcoming 2024 Article IV consultation assessing Sri Lankas economic health. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) had previously said the second review of Sri Lankas 2.9 billion bailout could be completed in the first half of 2024, provided it manages to meet debt restructuring and revenue targets set under the programme. The IMF executive board had cleared the first review of Sri Lankas 2.9 billion bailout in December last year, providing about 337 million in funds to help tackle the fallout from the countrys worst financial crisis in decades.",

        "date": "February 28, 2024 05:59 pm",
        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe has affirmed the governments commitment to fostering development through reconciliation, emphasising that nations worldwide which have eradicated racism and bigotry have experienced significant development. The President further highlighted how racism and bigotry have become convenient tools for politicians to wield power and for religious leaders to maintain their authority, recounting the grim lessons learned from the prolonged use of these divisive tactics, which ultimately led the nation into a devastating conflict. Addressing the Religions to Reconcile National Inter Religious Symposium, organized by the National Peace Council of Sri Lanka, held today (28 Feb.) at the Bandaranaike International Conference Hall (BMICH) in Colombo, President Wickremesinghe stressed the importance of fostering unity and religious harmony among all citizens, underscoring the governments proactive measures toward this goal. The interreligious conference served as a culmination of the Plural Action for Conflict Transformation project, spanning three years and encompassing 17 districts. President Wickremesinghe actively engaged with district representatives, addressing their queries and concerns during the event, underscoring the governments commitment to fostering reconciliation and harmony across the nation. Speaking at the conference, President Ranil Wickremesinghe further added; Having acknowledged the intrinsic connection between religion and reconciliation, our nation has endured the bitter consequences of racism and religious extremism, culminating in a devastating conflict. Following the cessation of hostilities, our main objective has been to foster coexistence among all communities. The responsibility of cultivating harmony rests significantly on the shoulders of religious leaders. It is imperative that we remain mindful of our intentions. While politicians often pursue power, religious leaders strive to maintain their positions, frequently resorting to the perilous avenues of racism and bigotry. This unfortunate trend has plagued our country since the 1930s, yielding disastrous outcomes that require no further explanation. Take Singapore, for example, where the absence of racism and bigotry has contributed to its rapid development despite its diverse linguistic landscape. With the military conflict resolved, Sri Lankas political challenges are now receiving attention, necessitating a renewed focus on coexistence, a topic also being deliberated in Parliament. Mr. Karu Jayasuriya, served as the Chairman of the Sectoral Oversight Committee on Religious Affairs and Co-Existence when he was serving as the Speaker. This committee was established in response to conflicts involving Muslims in March 2018, as well as incidents in Galle in 2017 and Beruwela in 2014. Various proposals were put forth by these committees to address these issues, and consensus was reached on their implementation. Its crucial that we uphold this agreement and continue working collaboratively to resolve these challenges. Towards the close of last year, numerous Buddhist monks and Tamil leaders presented the Himalaya Declaration, a document we are currently adhering to. As we move forward, the final phase entails fostering synergy, particularly through discussions with Tamil political parties and MPs, aimed at addressing lingering issues. Steps have been initiated to resolve the matter of missing persons, with further updates forthcoming in the near future. Additionally, arrangements have been made for the release of certain individuals held in connection with these matters. The primary concern at present revolves around the fate of the missing persons To address this issue, weve presented and successfully passed a bill in Parliament to establish the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC). Numerous reports from Disappearance Commissions have been reviewed, and one report authored by Judge A.H.M.D.Nawaz was selected. Following the approval of the draft for the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa pledged his support for these initiatives. Similar assistance is being extended by other nations as well, enabling us to advance these critical endeavours. Addressing the on-going political challenges, our attention is directed towards resolving land disputes, particularly in regions like Jaffna where tensions persist between villagers and the Wildlife Department. Similar conflicts also arise in areas such as Vavuniya, Trincomalee, Polonnaruwa, and Mahianganaya. We aim to address these issues through inclusive dialogue, involving all concerned parties. Furthermore, I have instructed to proceed in accordance with the 1985 map. Additionally, I anticipate meeting with Tamil MPs in Parliament next week to discuss these matters further. Following consultations with the security forces, agreements have been reached to release more land, providing a pathway forward in our efforts. Another pressing issue is the delimitation of powers. A key demand is the empowerment of the 3rd list of devolution, with an emphasis on not interfering with police powers at present, leaving them open for future consideration. The Land Act is slated for presentation, and there are no objections to the delegation of other subjects in the 3rd list. However, securing the necessary consensus with other parties in Parliament to achieve a two-thirds majority remains crucial. Simultaneously, discussions are underway regarding the implementation of the Provincial Board of Education. Proposals have been made to establish provincial professional training institutes in each province. Additionally, plans are underway to appoint provincial-level committees to lead the modernization of agriculture, establish a tourism board, and undertake related initiatives. Additionally, the work of five provincial ministries is expected to be distributed among twenty ministries. This restructuring cannot simply resemble a general ministry, so officials are currently deliberating on adjusting their structure accordingly. I eagerly anticipate addressing the final aspect of this matter, the decentralized budget, once all parties have convened. Theres also a call for a secondary board, akin to a Senate, which the government does not oppose. However, such an initiative would need to coincide with the framing of a constitution, potentially requiring a referendum. I also intend to engage in discussions on this topic with other party leaders. These measures aim to lay the groundwork for a new era in our country. Religious leaders have been entrusted with significant responsibilities in this endeavour. I am confident that further discussions on these matters will yield fruitful outcomes. The Maha Sangha, along with religious leaders and representatives, former Speaker Karu Jayasuriya, German Ambassador to Sri Lanka H.E. Dr. Felix Neumann, South African High Commissioner to Sri Lanka, H.E.

        "date": "February 28, 2024 07:59 pm",
        "content": "In his address at the Pathfinder Indian Ocean Security Conference phase III held in Colombo today (Feb.28), President Ranil Wickremesinghe emphasized Sri Lankas dedication to maintaining a strategic position aimed at ensuring the absence of major power rivalries and upholding freedom of navigation in the Indian Ocean. The President highlighted that Sri Lankas commitment to freedom of navigation has prompted the country to engage in operations as guardians of prosperity in the Red Sea. He underscored the significance of the Suez Canal, particularly evident during the Six-Day War when its closure for ten years negatively impacted the Colombo port, emphasizing the necessity of ensuring unrestricted navigation. President Wickremesinghe also highlighted emerging issues, including security concerns in the undersea domain, prompting a reassessment of approaches. He expressed the belief that the future lies in the Indian Ocean, stressing the importance of understanding Sri Lankas role within the broader Indo-Pacific framework. The President noted that the dynamics of the Indo-Pacific, originating from post-World War II arrangements such as the San Francisco system and the Shanghai communiqu√©, have evolved, leading to questions about the countrys positioning and potential involvement in regional conflicts. The two-day conference will see participation from delegates representing several nations, underscoring the significance of the Indian Ocean and its role in global security and supply chain resilience. The President further highlighted that its imperative to reconcile varying viewpoints on the Indo-Pacific, particularly regarding its geographical limits and implications for maritime security. Sri Lanka adamantly opposes the idea of confining the Indo-Pacific to Indias western boundary, stressing its wider territorial concerns that stretch to the African coast, he noted. This stance diverges sharply from Chinas expansive outlook, prompting scrutiny into the underlying motives and potential repercussions of these contrasting approaches. The President emphasized the importance of addressing emerging developments in the Indian Ocean amid complex geopolitical dynamics. This includes Chinas growing presence, which is bolstered by infrastructure projects like the Friendship Highway in Pakistan and agreements with India concerning connectivity and harbour development. Furthermore, the evolution of economic corridors such as the Mumbai-UAE-Israel-Europe connection highlights the changing geopolitical landscape, emphasizing the need for long-term strategic planning. In his address, President Wickremesinghe highlighted the interconnectedness of regional dynamics and the potential implications for maritime security and diplomacy, as evidenced by the recent conflict in Gaza. Stressing the arc of Islam stretching from the Middle East to Indonesia, he underscored the need for nuanced approaches to crisis management, considering geopolitical complexities and cultural sensitivities. Emphasizing the importance of embracing the Indian Oceans identity and historical significance, the Sri Lankan leader advocated for cooperation among major powers rather than competition. He outlined Sri Lankas vision for the region as a hub for economic growth extending beyond India to Africa. Regarding the resurgence of Asias influence, particularly Chinas pivot to the Indian Ocean and the Belt and Road Initiatives impact, the President highlighted the necessity of re-evaluating traditional power structures and alliances. He also addressed Russias eastward shift and the evolving dynamics between Iran and Saudi Arabia, which further complicate the geopolitical landscape, calling for nuanced diplomacy and strategic foresight. In conclusion, President Wickremesinghe reiterated Sri Lankas commitment to promoting stability and cooperation in the Indian Ocean region. He stressed the importance of maintaining an inclusive approach that respects the historical significance of the Indian Ocean and considers the perspectives of its diverse stakeholders for long-term peace and prosperity. US Ambassador Julie Chung, Japans Deputy Assistant Minister for Southwest Asian Affairs Hayashi Makoto, Founder of Pathfinder Mr. Milinda Moragoda, Co-Chairmen of the Pathfinder Indian Ocean Security Conference, Mr. Bernard Gunathilake  Mr. Shivshankar Menon, along with High Commissioners, Ambassadors, officials from Ministries, line institutions of the Ministries and the tri-forces participated in this event.",

        "date": "February 28, 2024 09:17 pm",
        "content": "State Minister of Finance Shehan Semasinghe, announced that the verification and certification process for applicants in the second phase of the Aswasuma program has been finalized. All necessary arrangements have been made to extend benefits to 2.4 million family units starting from June 2024. The State Minister underscored the imminent closure of the second phase of applications, slated to conclude on March 15, 2024. Emphasizing the importance of timely submission, he reiterated that individuals failing to submit their applications by the given deadline will forfeit eligibility for benefits associated with the program. These updates were provided by State Minister Semasinghe during his participation in a press briefing at the Presidential Media Centre today (28), themed Collective Path to a Stable Country. Additionally, Minister Semasinghe noted that approximately 7,000 individuals who were found to have received benefits based on false information have been removed from the program due to appeals and objections. The Minister of State for Finance provided further details, stating that initially, 3.4 million family units were certified for the programs first phase. Out of this, 1.9 million families have been deemed eligible to receive benefits. Following the assessment of appeals and objections received, the Welfare Benefit Board is prepared to commence payments to the selected beneficiaries from July 2024. A total of 1,227,000 appeals and objections were registered, of which around 1,197,000 have been resolved. Furthermore, there is a group of deserving individuals who did not receive welfare benefits because they did not submit their application forms during the initial application period. Following extensive online awareness efforts, we have received approximately 200,000 to 250,000 applications thus far. The application forms handed in directly to the Divisional Secretariats are currently being processed through our online system. The call for applications in the second phase will conclude after March 15, 2024. Its crucial to note that failure to submit application forms renders individuals ineligible for relief benefits. Furthermore, after completing the verification and certification of new applicants, all preparations have been finalized to extend insurance benefits to 2.4 million family units starting from June 2024. Consequently, we anticipate allocating Rs. 205 billion for compensation payments in 2024. Its worth mentioning that the allocation of these provisions has already been arranged. We are actively gathering information about such individuals. It is imperative to note that upon identifying them, we are ready to pursue the recovery of funds and initiate legal action against them in accordance with the law.",

        "title": "Hamas raises stakes in Gaza truce talks with Ramadan call",
        "date": "February 28, 2024 09:40 pm",
        "content": "Hamas urged Palestinians on Wednesday to march to Jerusalems Al-Aqsa Mosque at the start of Ramadan next month, raising the stakes in negotiations for a truce in Gaza, which U.S. President Joe Biden hopes will be in place by then. The call by Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh followed comments by Biden, broadcast on Tuesday, that there was an agreement in principle for a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas during Ramadan, while hostages held by the militants are released. Biden said he hoped such an agreement, which a source said would also allow more aid into the stricken Palestinian enclave and bring the release of Palestinians prisoners, could be finalised by March 4. The Muslim holy month of Ramadan is expected to begin on the evening of March 10. Both Israel and Hamas have played down the prospects for a truce and Qatari mediators have said the most contentious issues are still unresolved. Israel said on Monday it would allow Ramadan prayers at Jerusalems Al-Aqsa Mosque but set limits according to security needs, setting the stage for possible clashes if crowds of Palestinians turn up and Gaza violence is still raging. This is a call on our people in Jerusalem and the West Bank to march to Al-Aqsa since the first day of Ramadan, said Haniyeh, who described Hamass Oct. 7 rampage into Israel as a move to end Israeli attacks on Palestinian territories and sites. In a televised speech, he said Hamas was showing flexibility in negotiations with Israel but at the same time was ready to continue fighting. Israel has said any deal with Hamas would require the group to drop outlandish demands. Hamas is weighing a proposal, agreed by Israel at talks with mediators in Paris last week, for a 40-day ceasefire, which would be the first extended truce of the five-month-old war. Both sides have delegations in Qatar this week hammering out details. A senior source close to the talks said Israeli troops would pull out of populated areas under the agreement. But it did not appear to meet Hamass demand for a permanent end to the war and Israeli withdrawal, or resolve the fate of fighting-age Israeli men among those being held by Hamas. HANIYEH CALLS FOR MORE SUPPORT FROM ARAB STATES Haniyeh also called on the self-styled Axis of Resistance - allies of Iran consisting of Lebanons Hezbollah, Yemens Houthis, and the Islamic Resistance in Iraq - as well as Arab states, to step up their support for the Palestinians in Gaza. It is the duty of the Arab and Islamic nations to take the initiative to break the starvation conspiracy in Gaza, Haniyeh said, referring to what Palestinians say appears to be a deliberate policy by Israel to deny them food. Israel says its blockade on Gaza is essential to destroy Hamas, which it sees as an existential threat since the Oct. 7 attacks, but that it is allowing in humanitarian supplies, trading blame with aid agencies for shortfalls they say have led to acute hunger. The Israeli military said on Wednesday it had cooperated with the United Arab Emirates, Jordan, Egypt, France and the United States in an airdrop of food aid to southern Gaza. The Palestinian death toll neared 30,000 on Wednesday, at 29,954, according to Gaza health officials, who say many others are buried beneath the rubble of ruined buildings across Gaza. Israel began its assault after Hamas killed 1,200 people on Oct. 7 and seized 253 hostages, with 136 still being held, according to Israeli tallies. On Wednesday, Israeli tanks and planes pounded northern Gaza, residents said, months after the army declared Hamas defeated there, and the government pledged to settle more Israelis among Palestinians in the West Bank, another hurdle to a peace deal. Palestinian health officials said 18 bodies of people killed on Tuesday had been recovered in Khan Younis in the southern Gaza Strip, where several residential buildings were destroyed on Wednesday by Israeli tanks. In the north, Israels focus was on the suburb of Zeitoun, which has been witnessing fierce gunbattles in the past few days, despite the armys claim it had gained control of the area months ago, residents and militants said. On Wednesday morning a man and a boy were killed in an air strike on a house in Zeitoun, medics said. One Palestinian official with knowledge of the matter told Reuters mediation efforts were intensifying, but there was no certainty of success. Time is pressuring because Ramadan is closing in, mediators have stepped up their efforts, the Palestinian official, with knowledge of effort told Reuters. It is early to say whether there will be an agreement soon, but things are not stalled, he said. Source  Reuters - Agencies",

        "date": "February 29, 2024 08:06 am",
        "content": "(Reuters) -An Illinois state judge on Wednesday barred Donald Trump from appearing on the Illinois Republican presidential primary ballot because of his role in the insurrection at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, but she delayed her ruling from taking effect in light of an expected appeal by the former U.S. president. Cook County Circuit Judge Tracie Porter sided with Illinois voters who argued that the former president should be disqualified from the states March 19 primary ballot and its Nov. 5 general election ballot for violating the anti-insurrection clause of the U.S. Constitutions 14th Amendment. The final outcome of the Illinois case and similar challenges will likely be decided by the U.S. Supreme Court, which heard arguments related to Trumps ballot eligibility on Feb. 8. Porter said she was staying her decision because she expected his appeal to Illinois appellate courts, and a potential ruling from the U.S. Supreme Court. The advocacy group Free Speech For People, which spearheaded the Illinois disqualification effort, praised the ruling as a historic victory in a statement. A campaign spokesperson for Trump, the national frontrunner for the 2024 Republican nomination, said in a statement this is an unconstitutional ruling that we will quickly appeal. Colorado and Maine earlier removed Trump from their state ballots after determining he is disqualified under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment to the Constitution. Both decisions are on hold while Trump appeals. Section 3 bars from public office anyone who took an oath to support the U.S. Constitution and then has engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof. Trump supporters on Jan. 6, 2021, attacked police and swarmed the Capitol in a bid to prevent Congress from certifying Democrat Joe Bidens 2020 election victory. Trump gave an incendiary speech to supporters beforehand, telling them to go to the Capitol and fight like hell. He then for hours did not act on requests that he urge the mob to stop. The Supreme Court is currently weighing Trumps challenge to his Colorado disqualification. The justices in Washington appeared skeptical of the decision during oral arguments in the case, expressing concerns about states taking sweeping actions that could affect the national election.

        "date": "February 29, 2024 11:24 am",
        "content": "An organiser of a white party in Sri Lanka has apologised after the event sparked a backlash online. The events advertisement specified a white dress code, but also had a line saying Face control: White - which was largely interpreted to mean the event was open only to white people. An organiser later said the event was a bad idea, adding that it was meant to bring together expatriates. The party, which was due to take place last Saturday, was cancelled. Backlash against the event was swift, with many on social media calling it disgusting and racist. I know not all expats are like this... but this sort of thing should be stopped fast and stopped hard, said one local restaurant owner. How dare they come to a brown country and ban the people of that country, another social media user said on Facebook. Writing on Instagram under the handle geo_ecstatic, a man who said he was an event organiser, said there was no malice or racism in planning the party. We wanted to meet expats who have been living here for a long time and love Sri Lanka. The team... supported me and a joint decision was made to quickly organise a party, he said, adding that he has since had to leave the country after receiving a barrage of abuse and threats. I didnt expect this to be such a sensitive moment for a huge number of people. I admit that it was a bad idea... and I understand that we created it ourselves out of our stupidity. I deeply apologise to everyone whose feelings were hurt. The event was due to be held in the Sarayka Lounge in the southern coastal town of Unawatuna. The venue later posted a statement saying the party had been cancelled, adding that its staff team  did not conduct a thorough-enough check and have severed ties with the event planners. We have never supported and will never support various racist statements or organisations, they wrote. The organiser as well as the owners of Sarayka Lounge are believed to be Russian citizens. Rupasena Koswatta, president of an Unawatuna entrepreneurs association told BBC Sinhala many Russians have moved into Unawatuna, a coastal city just 5km (3.1mi) from Galle, in the last two years. Many of the tourism businesses there are now owned by Russians in the area now known by many as Little Moscow. The Russian Embassy in Colombo later released a statement saying it strongly condemns all forms of racial discrimination and nationalism and urged citizens residing on the island to follow its laws and respect local customs. Later on Sunday, Sri Lanka said it had ended long-term tourist visa extensions for Russians and Ukrainians. More than 288,000 Russians and nearly 20,000 Ukrainians have travelled to Sri Lanka since Moscows invasion of Ukraine, according to reports. But the countrys President Ranil Wickremesinghe later reportedly said the decision was made without prior Cabinet approval. Source - BBC --Agencies",

Thousands of medical interns and residents have been on strike for about 10 days to protest the governments push to boost medical school enrollments. Government officials have warned that strikers would face legal repercussions if they dont return to their hospitals by Thursday. As of Wednesday night, about 9,076 of the countrys 13,000 medical interns and residents were confirmed to have left their hospitals after submitting resignations, according to the Health Ministry. Observers say many strikers are likely to defy the deadline, continuing the labor boycott for weeks or months. The government is expected to begin formal steps toward punishments on Monday, as Friday is a national holiday. Weve said that we wont hold them responsible for leaving their worksites if they return by today, Vice Health Minister Park Min-soo told a briefing. Doctors are there to serve patients, and those patients are anxiously waiting for you. This isnt the way to protest against the government. Park said officials had invited 94 representatives of the strikers to a meeting on Thursday afternoon, using a mass text message. Its not clear if any doctors will attend, but Park said he would go to the meeting site and meet with anyone who showed up. Starting March 4, the government will notify doctors who miss the deadline that it plans to suspend their licenses, and will give them opportunities to respond, senior Health Ministry official Kim Chung-hwan told the same briefing. Under South Korean law, the government can order doctors back to work if it sees grave risks to public health. Those who refuse to abide by such orders can have their medical licenses suspended for up to one year, and also face up to three years in prison or a 30 million won (roughly 22,500) fine. Those who receive prison sentences would be stripped of their medical licenses. Some observers say authorities will probably punish only leaders of the strike to avoid further straining hospital operations. At the center of the dispute is a government plan to admit 2,000 more applicants to medical schools starting next year, a two thirds increase from the current 3,058. The government says it aims to add up to 10,000 new doctors by 2035 to cope with the countrys fast-aging population. Officials say South Koreas doctor-to-population ratio is one of the lowest among industrialized countries. But many doctors reject the plan, arguing that universities arent ready to provide quality education to that many new students. They also say the government plan would also fail to address chronic shortage of doctors in essential but low-paying specialties like pediatrics and emergency departments. But their critics say the striking junior doctors simply worry about expected lower income because of the sharply increased number of fellow doctors. The governments plan is broadly popular with the South Korean public, according to a poll. The countrys 13,000 trainee doctors represent a small fraction of South Koreas 140,000 doctors, but they account for about 30-40 of the total doctors at some major hospitals and perform many vital functions to support senior medical staff. The doctors walkouts have caused cancellations or delays to several hundred surgeries and other medical treatments at their hospitals, according to the Health Ministry. The ministry says the countrys handling of emergency and critical patients remains largely stable, as public medical institutions extended their working hours and military hospitals opened their emergency rooms to the public. But observers say if senior doctors join the trainee doctors strikes, South Koreas medical service would suffer serious damage. The Korea Medical Association, which represents the countrys 140,000 doctors, has said it supports the trainee doctors, but hasnt yet decided whether to join the walkouts.

Accordingly, the court stated that an order will be issued invalidating the Cabinet decision taken on 15 October 2019 in this regard. The relevant court order was issued by Supreme Court Justice Priyantha Jayawardena, with the concurrence of Justices Gamini Amarasekera and Kumudini Wickremasinghe, upon consideration of a Fundamental Rights (FR) petition filed by the Centre for Policy Alternatives (CPA) and its Executive Director Dr. Paikiasothy Saravanamuttu. The petition further sought a court order stating that former President Sirisena had violated several fundamental rights of the public by taking decisions pertaining to his own privileges and rights during his tenure as the President, thereby making him the head of the Cabinet of Ministers. Announcing the verdict, Supreme Court Justice Priyantha Jayawardena highlighted that the relevant Cabinet decision made by Sirisena was, in fact, unlawful, given that he was both, the President and the head of the Cabinet of Ministers at the time the decision in question was taken. In their petition, the CPA and Dr. Pakiasothy Saravanamuttu claimed that the residence in question is of great financial value to the country, and thereby stated that such an allocation for a former President was irrational, illegal and arbitrary, and also violated several fundamental rights of the countrys citizens including that of the right to equality.",

The comic, who disclosed last year that he was battling Parkinsons disease, died at his home in Los Angeles on Tuesday evening after suffering a heart attack, publicist Jeff Abraham said. Richard and I were born three days apart in the same hospital and for most of my life hes been like a brother to me, David said in a written statement. He had that rare combination of being the funniest person and also the sweetest. But today he made me sob and for that Ill never forgive him. His wife, Joyce Lapinsky, thanks everyone for all the love, friendship and support and asks for privacy at this time, Abraham said in a written statement. Brooklyn-born Lewis began performing stand-up comedy in the early 1970s while working a day job in advertising and by the end of the decade had risen to the forefront of his generation of comedians. He was a regular on late-night talk shows through the 1980s and starred alongside Jamie Lee Curtis on the ABC TV comedy Anything But Love. He made several film appearances in the 1990s, most notably in Robin Hood: Men in Tights.

India, which is seeking to rival countries such as Taiwan in chipmaking, expects its semiconductor market to be worth 63 billion by 2026, but does not yet have a chipmaking facility. Prime Minister Narendra Modi wants to make India a chipmaker for the world as his government tries to overcome setbacks faced in its bid to offer 10 billion in incentives to the industry. Indian Electronics Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said construction will begin on the plants within the next 100 days, adding that they will manufacture and package chips for sectors including defence, automobiles and telecommunication. This is a big decision for the country and a key accomplishment towards making India a self-dependent country, Vaishnaw told reporters. He did not give updates on other key chipmaking applicants, including Indian conglomerate Vedanta, Taiwans Foxconn and Israels Tower Semiconductor. Tata will partner with Taiwans Powerchip to set up Indias first chipmaking plant worth 910 billion rupees in Gujarat states Dholera, he said, while CG Power will partner with Japans Renesas Electronics Corp and Thailands Stars Microelectronics for a 76 billion rupees chip packaging plant, also in Gujarat.

        "date": "February 29, 2024 07:04 pm",
        "content": "The Madras High Court on Thursday, February 29, 2024, directed the Tamil Nadu government to appoint a senior Indian Administrative Service (IAS) officer and an Indian Police Service (IPS) officer as nodal officers in-charge, to make all necessary arrangements to take the mortal remains of former PM Rajiv Gandhi assassination convict Santhan alias T. Suthenthirarajah to Sri Lanka. Santhan died at the Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital in Chennai on February 28, 2024. A Division Bench of Justices R. Sureshkumar and K. Kumaresh Babu issued the direction after Additional Solicitor General (ASG) AR.L. Sundaresan and State Public Prosecutor (SPP) Hasan Mohamed Jinnah informed the court that the mortal remains could be flown to the convicts home country only if the Sri Lankan Deputy High Commission in Chennai granted the necessary permission. The ASG also told the court that the Foreigners Regional Registration Officer (FRRO) in Chennai would issue the necessary clearance if the permission from the High Commission was accompanied with the death certificate and embalming certificate. Therefore, the judges directed the State government to expedite the process of issuing both the certificates though government doctors. They also directed the State government to liaise with the Deputy High Commission through its nodal officers for the issuance of necessary permissions, swiftly and smoothly. The FRRO and the State government were further directed to take all steps necessary for the transportation of the body to Sri Lanka, and asked for the filing of a compliance report before the court on March 4. The interim order was passed on a writ petition that Santhan had originally filed, through his counsel M. Radhakrishnan and P. Pugalendhi, in 2023 seeking permission to go to Sri Lanka. He complained that though the Supreme Court had ordered his release from prison, the FRRO lodged him at a foreigners detention camp in Tiruchi for want of necessary travel documents from the Deputy High Commission. Initially, the FRRO, falling under the Union Ministry of Home Affairs, responded to the case stating he had written to the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) asking the latter to obtain the necessary travel documents in favour of the writ petitioner from the Deputy High Commission but he was yet to receive any response from the MEA to his communication. After several hearings, the State government informed the court on February 13, 2024 that the Deputy High Commission had issued the travel document in favour of the petitioner on February 1, 2024 itself and communicated it to the State government on February 2, 2024. The document had been issued pursuant to a request made by the MEA on November 29, 2023. However, the ASG told the court he had no instructions regarding the issuance of the travel document by the Deputy High Commission and obtained time till February 29, 2024 to get instructions from the FRRO. Accordingly, when the matter was heard on Thursday (February 29, 2024), the court was informed that the FRRO had issued the exit permit, on basis of the Deputy High Commissions travel document, on February 22, 2024 itself but the petitioner died at the Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital in Chennai on February 28, 2024. The court was also told that he had been under treatment for certain ailments since January 2024. When the court called for the medical records, the SPP submitted them and informed the judges that after the issuance of the exit permit by the FRRO on February 22, 2024, it had been decided to fly the petitioner to Sri Lanka in an air ambulance on February 27, 2024. However, at around 7 am on February 27, he suffered a massive cardiac arrest and died at 7:50 am on February 28, the court was told. Stating the post-mortem had been completed and the embalming process too had ended, the SPP said, the State government was ready to provide any assistance required by the petitioners family to take the mortal remains to Sri Lanka. After recording his submissions, the judges ordered appointment of a senior IAS officer and an IPS officer as nodal officers to carry out the task at the earliest. Source: The Hindu --Agencies",

        "content": "Former Health Minister Keheliya Rambukwella, former Health Ministry Secretary Janaka Chandragupta and 5 others have been further remanded until 14th March by the Maligakanda Magistrate Court over the import of substandard human immunoglobulin vials. Former Minister Rambukwella, who was in remand custody, was produced before the Maligakanda Magistrates Court earlier today (29), along with the other accused when the case was taken up. On 15 February, Rambukwella and six others including former Health Secretary Janaka Chandragupta were remanded until 29 February on orders of the Maligakanda Magistrates Court. The Criminal Investigation Department (CID) arrested Rambukwella on 02 February in connection with the procurement of substandard human intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), when he arrived there, complying with a court order. He had been grilled for nearly 10 hours before being arrested. The arrest came hot on the heels of pressure from civil society activists and health sector trade unionists, who called for the immediate apprehension of the lawmaker. Prior to the apprehension of Rambukwella, seven arrests had been made in connection with the drug procurement scam. But the fifth accused was later released on bail. As such, the former Health Secretary, the Director of the Health Ministrys Medical Supplies Division (MSD) and three other officials of the same division, as well as the owner of the company, which is said to have supplied the substandard batch of immunoglobulin vials, now remain in remand custody. Meanwhile a Fundamental Rights (FR) petition was filed Thursday (29 Feb.) on behalf of former Health Minister Keheliya Rambukwella. Rambukwellas attorneys have filed the relevant petition challenging his arrest by the Criminal Investigation Department (CID), and demanding a compensation of Rs. 100 million.",

        "content": "The State Minister for Technology, Mr. Kanaka Herath, announced that the anticipated National Cyber Security Act will be introduced this year, followed by the establishment of the Cyber Security Authority. Additionally, the State Minister underscored the preparations made for the Digital Economy Summit scheduled to take place in Sri Lanka by the end of July. The summit serves as a platform for fostering innovation, collaboration, and investment in digital technologies, thus propelling the country towards a more resilient and prosperous digital economy, he said. Speaking at a press briefing titled Collective Path to a Stable Country held at the President Media Centre (PMC) today (29), State Minister Herath further said; The digital economy, which previously stood at 4.73, has now surpassed the 5 mark, indicating significant growth. This expansion has notably bolstered the countrys overall economic resilience. To further enhance this momentum, preparations are underway for the Digital Economy Summit scheduled to take place in Sri Lanka at the end of July. The summit aims to attract both local and foreign investors, with collaborative efforts from foreign embassies, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Ministry of Investment Promotion facilitating this initiative. Furthermore, a sum of Rs. 50 million derived from the profits of Sri Lanka Standards Institution (SLSI) was allocated to the treasury in the previous year. In line with President Ranil Wickremesinghes proposal, a new initiative has been launched to uplift small and medium-sized industrialists, who constitute 52 of the countrys economy. This endeavour seeks to empower such enterprises technologically, offering them good manufacturing practice (GMP) and SLSI certifications. Additionally, plans are underway to facilitate access to low-interest loans through the Asian Development Bank (ADB), with the ultimate goal of guiding these small and medium-sized industrialists into the market. In addition, the Sri Lanka Computer Emergency Readiness Team (SLCERT) is anticipated to introduce the National Cyber Security Act within the year, followed swiftly by the establishment of the Cyber Security Authority. Concurrently, in collaboration with the Ministry of Education, 700 out of 1000 selected schools lacking internet access have already been equipped with this essential facility. As the next phase of this initiative, plans are underway to establish AI Centers aimed at introducing the subject of Artificial Intelligence at the school level, further advancing education in this critical field. Additionally, there are plans to commence a six-month technology industry training program in May, targeting 10,000 non-technical graduates. This initiative is being undertaken in collaboration with the Ministry of Higher Education. Source: PMD",

        "date": "February 29, 2024 10:49 pm",
        "content": "(Reuters) - Gaza health authorities said more than 100 Palestinians were shot dead by Israeli forces as they waited for an aid delivery on Thursday, but Israel challenged the death toll and said many of the victims were run over by aid trucks. At least 104 people were killed and more than 280 wounded in the incident near Gaza City, Palestinian health officials said, and the death toll in nearly five months of war passed 30,000. Medical teams said they were unable to cope with the volume and severity of the injuries, with dozens of wounded taken to the al-Shifa hospital, which is only partially operational after Israeli raids on the facility. The incident caused the largest loss of civilian lives in weeks. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said it was an ugly massacre conducted by the Israeli occupation army on people who waited for aid trucks at the Nabulsi roundabout. Israel disputed the account provided by health officials in Hamas-run Gaza, which has been bombarded by Israeli forces for months in the war that began after the Palestinian militant groups deadly attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7. An Israeli military official said two separate incidents had occurred as the convoy of trucks passed into northern Gaza from the south along the main coastal road. In the first incident, he said aid trucks were surrounded by hundreds of people and in the confusion, dozens were injured or killed, by being trampled or run over by the trucks. As the trucks left, he said, a second incident occurred in which some of the people who rushed the convoy approached Israeli forces including a tank, which then opened fire. The soldiers fired warning shots in the air and then fired towards those who posed a threat and did not move away, he told a news briefing. From our perspective, this is what we understand. Were continuing to review the circumstances. He said he did not believe the death toll provided by the Palestinian authorities but provided no Israeli estimate, saying it was a limited response. Ashraf Al-Qidra, spokesperson for the Gaza health ministry, dismissed the Israeli version of events. He said the latest comments showed Israel had pre-plotted intentions to carry out the new crime and massacre, and that the death toll could rise. Palestinian militant group Hamas, which has run the Gaza strip since 2007, said in a statement that the incident could jeopardise talks in Qatar aimed at securing a ceasefire and the release of Israeli hostages being held by Hamas in the enclave. U.S. President Joe Biden also acknowledged the potential impact of the incident on efforts to mediate a truce. Asked whether he thought the incident would complicate matters, he said: I know it will. CHAOS One video shared on social media, which Reuters was able to verify as being at the roundabout, showed trucks loaded with many dead bodies, as well as wounded people. Another, which Reuters could not verify, showed bloodstained people being carried in a truck, bodies wrapped in shrouds and doctors treating injured patients on the hospital floor. We dont want aid like this. We dont want aid and bullets together. There are many martyrs, a man said in one of the videos. The U.S. said it was looking into reports of what it called a serious incident. We mourn the loss of innocent life and recognise the dire humanitarian situation in Gaza, where innocent Palestinians are just trying to feed their families, a White House National Security Council spokesperson said, adding it underscored the need to get more humanitarian aid into Gaza, including through a potential ceasefire. The Palestinian health authorities said 30,035 Palestinians had been confirmed killed and more than 70,000 wounded in Israels offensive, launched after the Oct. 7 attack in which Israel said Hamas gunmen killed 1,200 people and abducted 253. Much of Gaza has been reduced to rubble and the majority of its 2.3 million population displaced from their homes at least once. Aid deliveries to northern Gaza have been rare and chaotic, passing through more active military zones to an area where the U.N. says many people are starving, with videos showing desperate crowds surging around supply trucks. U.N. and other relief agencies have complained that Israel has denied attempts they have made to transfer humanitarian aid to northern parts of the enclave, restricting movement and communications. Juliette Touma, director of communications at UNRWA, the main U.N. aid agency for Gaza, said there had been a drop of about 50 in the average daily number of trucks entering Gaza. She said the clock is ticking fast towards severe hunger, starvation and in some cases famine. Israel has denied any restrictions on humanitarian aid for civilians in Gaza and has said the U.N. is responsible for failures to deliver supplies. On Wednesday, Israel said a convoy of 31 trucks had moved to northern Gaza on Tuesday night and that the U.N. was responsible for distribution. The U.N. humanitarian agency OCHA said no U.N. agency was involved in that aid convoy. Officials from UNRWA say deliveries have also been hampered by the refusal of uniformed municipal police in Gaza to provide security for the convoys after some were killed in Israeli strikes.

        "content": "At least 43 people have been killed after a fire broke out in a multi-storey building in Bangladesh, the countrys health minister says. According to local media, the blaze began in a restaurant at around 22:00 local time (16:00 GMT) on Thursday in the capital, Dhaka. It spread quickly through the building, trapping dozens of people. The fire was later bought under control, according to fire officials, and the cause is being investigated. Bangladeshs Health Minister, Samanta Lal Sen, said that at least 33 people, including women and children, were declared dead at the Dhaka Medical College Hospital. At least 10 others died at the citys main burns hospital. Dozens more people have been sent there for treatment, Mr Sen said. The emergency services were called to the Kacchi Bhai restaurant, which according to the Daily Bangladesh newspaper, is in a building that has seven floors. The complex that the building is in also contains other restaurants, as well as several clothing and mobile phone shops. We were at the sixth floor when we first saw smoke racing through the staircase, said a restaurant manager called Sohel, according to AFP. A lot of people rushed upstairs. We used a water pipe to climb down the building. Some of us were injured as they jumped from upstairs. Another survivor, Mohammad Altaf, told Reuters that he narrowly escaped the blaze through a broken window. He said two of his colleagues, who had helped to get people out, both later died. Fires in commercial and residential buildings are common in Bangladesh. They are often blamed on poor safety awareness and an inadequate enforcement of regulations. Source: BBC -Agencies",

To this, state public prosecutor Hasan Mohamed Jinnah informed the court that the state planned to send Santhan to Sri Lanka on Feb 27 using an air ambulance, but his health condition deteriorated and he passed away on Feb 28.

        "date": "March 1, 2024 11:03 am",
        "content": "Indias economy grew at its fastest pace in one-and-half years in the final three months of 2023, led by strong manufacturing and construction activity and bolstering Prime Minister Narendra Modis economic record just months before a national election. Asias third largest economy grew 8.4 in the October-December quarter, much faster than the 6.6 estimated by economists polled by Reuters and higher than the 7.6 recorded in the previous three months. The ongoing growth momentum is indicative of the Indian economys resilience, notwithstanding global headwinds, said Sunil Kumar Sinha, economist at India Ratings, noting that industrial growth continued its good run in the quarter. India has consistently beat market expectations and is ranked as one of the fastest-growing economies in the world, with China struggling to recover after the pandemic and the euro zone narrowly escaping a recession. India revised its growth estimate for the current fiscal year to March 31 to 7.6 from 7.3. Such a strong showing in the last major economic data release before elections due by May could bolster Modis chances after he made high economic growth one of his main platforms at rallies across the country. The December growth shows the strength of Indian economy and its potential, Modi said in a social media post. Modi has sharply raised government spending on infrastructure and offered incentives to boost manufacturing of phones, electronics, drones and semiconductors to help India compete with likes of Vietnam and Thailand. The manufacturing sector, which for the past decade has accounted for 17 of Asias third-largest economy, expanded 11.6 year-on-year in the December quarter, while investment growth was above 10 for the second consecutive quarter, and the construction sector grew by more than 9. Manufacturing sector growth was supported by lower input costs, said Rajani Sinha, Economist at CareEdge. Private consumption, accounting for 60 of gross domestic product (GDP), recovered slightly in the quarter, with a 3.5 year-on-year rise, compared with 2.4 in the previous three months. Government spending contracted 3.2 year-on-year, compared with 1.4 growth in the previous quarter. RURAL WEAKNESS The farm sector, which accounts for about 15 of the 3.7 trillion economy, continued to struggle due to unfavourable monsoon rains. It contracted 0.8 in the December quarter, compared with 1.6 growth in the September quarter. Slowing rural growth dragged down farm incomes and some farmers have hit the streets demanding higher procurement prices. Rural weakness has lead to slower growth for major retail companies like Hindustan Unilever (HLL.NS), opens new tab and Britannia Industries (BRIT.NS), opens new tab. The pace of growth in real rural wages was around 1 in 2023 after contracting nearly 3 in the previous two years, according to ICRA, while average salaries in urban areas have been going up by nearly 10 a year. However, policymakers remain optimistic on rural recovery. With the anticipated better value addition in the farm sector next financial year, rural demand growth and rural income growth will be even better and more evident in FY25, countrys Chief Economic Adviser V Anantha Nageswaran said.

There, the CBSL officials will be inquired about the process and rationale behind the recent salary hike given to its employees. This was decided at the meeting of Committee on Parliamentary Business held this morning (March 01). Next weeks parliamentary sessions are slated to be held from Tuesday to Thursday. Earlier this week, the CBSL requested the President, in his capacity as the Minister of Finance, for an opportunity to apprise the Members of Parliament, through an appropriate Parliamentary Committee, of the recent salary increment which came under fire. The request was made in writing by CBSL Governor Dr. Nandalal Weerasinghe. Issuing a release in this regard, the CBSL had explained that the latest revision of remuneration of its employees had been approved by the Governing Board under the triennial Collective Agreement entered into with the Trade Unions covering the period 2024- 2026. CBSL will explain its position upon being offered the requested opportunity or on receipt of a request for information, the statement read. In light of the situation, State Minister of Finance Shehan Semasinghe suggested that CBSL officials be summoned before the Committee on Public Finance (COPF), for clarifications pertaining to the matter. Recent media reports revealed that the CBSL had increased the salaries of its employees by 70 and the move was heavily criticized by parliamentarians of both the ruling party and the opposition.",
