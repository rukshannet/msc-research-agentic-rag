        "title": "India slashes import taxes on key metals, smartphones",
        "date": "July 24, 2024 09:55 pm",
        "content": "India slashed import duties on gold and silver to 6 percent from 15 percent , a move that industry officials say could boost retail demand and help curtail smuggling in the worlds second-biggest consumer of bullion. Higher demand for gold from India could boost global prices, which hit a record high this year, although that could widen Indias trade deficit and put pressure on the ailing rupee. To enhance domestic value addition in gold and precious metal jewelry, I propose to reduce customs duties of gold and silver to 6 percent , Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said in a budget speech on Tuesday. She also announced an import duty exemption for 25 critical minerals, including lithium. India has been exploring ways to secure supplies of lithium, a critical raw material used to make electric vehicle batteries. India announced it will cut import duty on mobile phones and some key parts to 15 percent from 20 percent, a move that will directly benefit Apple, which still imports its high-end smartphones into the country despite increasing local production. Presenting the annual budget for 202425 in parliament on Tuesday, Indias finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman said import tax on mobile phones, printed circuit board assembly (PCBA) and mobile chargers is in the interest of consumers. Almost 10-12 percent of the Apple iPhones are imported each year into India and a 5 percent reduction in tax on the devices will result in a 35-50 million annual benefit to Apple, said Neil Shah, a co-founder at Hong Kong-based Counterpoint Research. Although Apple has boosted its local production in India through contract manufacturers such as Foxconn and Indias Tata Group, it still imports some of its high-end Pro and Pro Max iPhone models into the country. Apple will directly benefit  they (also) have some models for which PCBAs are still being imported, said Shah. The move will also alleviate import duties for new players entering the market. Its a gamechanger for them, he added. Other manufacturers such as Samsung would also benefit, but to a lesser degree as the majority of their smartphones are locally made, said a source with direct knowledge of the matter. Apple and Samsung did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Apple has a 6 percent share of Indias smartphone market, according to Counterpoint. Indias deputy IT ministry in January privately argued for a reduction on import taxes on mobile phones, saying the country risks losing out to China and Vietnam in the race to become a major smartphone export hub and must act fast to lure global companies with lower tariffs, Reuters has reported. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has in recent years promoted India as a smartphone manufacturing hub and the nations 24-billion local production scheme covers mobile phones, prompting companies such as Apple, Xiaomi, Samsung and Vivo to expand local operations. Chinas Xiaomi has also in the past asked for tariff reductions on sub-components used in batteries, USB cables and phone covers. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

We need to leverage our natural resources to boost income generation. This is my formal and official announcement as the presidential candidate of Sri Lanka for the 2024 Presidential Election, he added.

        "date": "July 25, 2024 10:07 am",
        "content": "A tanker carrying close to 1.5 million litres of industrial fuel has capsized and sank off the Philippine capital on Thursday, causing an oil spill, officials say. Sixteen crew members of the Philippine-flagged MT Terra Nova have been rescued while one remains missing, Transportation Secretary Jaime Bautista said. Mr Bautista said an oil spill has been detected but strong winds and high waves were hampering the authorities response. The incident comes a day after Typhoon Gaemi intensified seasonal monsoon rains, submerging large swathes of Metro Manila and its suburbs in deep floods. Gaemi has made landfall in Taiwan, leaving three people killed and wounding hundreds more. The MT Terra Nova was heading for the central Philippine city of Iloilo when it sank, leaving an oil spill stretching for several kilometres, authorities said. It capsized and eventually submerged, the coast guard said in a report, adding they were investigating whether bad weather was a factor. Philippine coast guard spokesperson Rear Admiral Armando Balilo told a briefing that the agency was racing against time to contain the spill. He added that if all the oil in the tanker leaked, it would be the biggest spill in Philippine history. There is a big danger that Manila will be affected, even the shoreline of Manila, if the fuel will leak, because it is within Manila Bay, he said. Manila Bay, where the tanker capsized, hosts busy shipping lanes and its shores are home to shopping malls, casino resorts and fishing communities. In March 2023, an oil tanker carrying 800,000 litres of industrial fuel sank off the coast of Oriental Mindoro province. That oil reached the shores of several nearby fishing villages, coating beaches in black sludge. Residents in coastal villages reported experiencing cramps, vomiting and dizziness, and clean-up workers deployed to the affected village of Pola also reported feeling ill. Almost two decades earlier, an oil tanker carrying around two million litres of oil sank in heavy seas off the Guimaras island province. However only one of its 10 compartments leaked oil.

        "date": "July 25, 2024 10:30 am",
        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe reaffirmed his unwavering commitment to advancing Buddhist education in Sri Lanka, regardless of the challenges faced. He made this declaration during a scholarship award ceremony held at Temple Trees yesterday (24). At the ceremony, 3,000 scholarships were awarded to assist student monks, Seela Mathas at Piriven and Seela Matha Educational Institutions, and lay students across the country. This was part of the Presidential Scholarship Program 2024, organized by the Presidents Fund under the directives of the President. Scholarships are being offered to student monks studying up to the Piriven (Ordinary Level), Seela Matha, and lay students studying up to G.C.E. (Ordinary Level). An amount of Rs.9, 000 has been directly credited to the accounts of these students, along with the outstanding instalments and future payments will be made monthly in instalments of Rs.3, 000. Additionally, Rs. 6,000 per month will be awarded to student monks, Seela Matha, and lay students who pass the Piriven (Ordinary Level), G.C.E. (Ordinary Level) exam and precede to the Piriven Pracheena or G.C.E. (Advanced Level) exams, up until the month they take the exam. Scholarships are to be awarded for a period of 24 months, and Rs. 18,000 was credited to each scholarship recipients account on the day of the scholarship ceremony, including outstanding instalments. Instalment payments will be directly deposited into the bank accounts of other scholarship recipients who were not able to attend the ceremony in the near future. All scholarship recipients have been selected with the full cooperation of each Piriven Parivenadhipathi Thero or Institute Director, with all activities supervised by the Pirivena Education Division of the Ministry of Education. The Presidents Fund allocates nearly Rs.300 million annually for this scholarship program. President Ranil Wickremesinghe further said; Today, we are launching a new phase of the Presidential Scholarship Program, which now includes provisions for student monks and seela matha. We have transferred all outstanding scholarship amounts to the recipients bank accounts. This scholarship program has a significant background. I dont need to elaborate on the hardships faced by the people over the past four years due to the economic downturn. With the stabilization of the countrys economy, it is time to provide relief to the people. To this end, we have implemented various initiatives such as Aswesuma and Urumaya. We have also introduced several scholarship programs through the Presidents Fund to help talented students from low-income families continue their education. Given the countrys economic situation, monks in rural temples are also facing difficulties. We cannot allow monk education to collapse, so we have implemented this scholarship program for the monks and Seela Matha. In focusing on the Buddhist order, we must create the necessary conditions for nurturing a new generation of monks in the country. This scholarship program represents a significant initiative by the government toward that goal. Buddhist education should be preserved and enhanced. When the Piriven system was established, I had the opportunity to support it. I must emphasize that, despite the countrys challenges, we will never abandon this responsibility. Prime Minister Dinesh Gunawardena, Ministers Susil Premajayantha, Prasanna Ranatunga, Bandula Gunawardena, MPs Vajira Abeywardena, Pradeep Undugoda, Western Province Governor, Marshal of the Air Force Roshan Gunathilake, Senior Adviser to the President on National Security and Chief of Presidential Staff Sagala Ratnayaka, Secretary to the President Saman Ekanayake, Secretary to the Prime Minister Anura Dissanyake, Secretary to the Ministry of Public Administration Pradeep Yasarathne, Senior Additional Secretary to the President and Secretary to the Presidents Fund W.A.

Fire fighters extinguished the blaze, an official at the Gyeonggi Northern Fire and Disaster Headquarters said. South Koreas military said some trash balloons were equipped with timed poppers that could cause fires. A timer is attached to the trash balloons, which has the effect of popping the balloons and spreading the trash after a certain period of time has passed, Lee Sung-jun, a spokesperson for South Koreas Joint Chiefs of Staff, told a briefing. Lee said 480 balloons had landed mostly carrying paper and plastic trash in South Korea as of Thursday.

        "date": "July 25, 2024 04:53 pm",
        "content": "The Cabinet of Ministers has recently approved President Ranil Wickremesinghes Cabinet Memorandum to implement the National Agenda for Anti-Corruption. This decision aligns with the legal, organizational, and strategic anti-corruption framework outlined in the International Monetary Funds report on governance diagnostics technical assistance support, said Presidents Media Division. The National Anti-Corruption Framework includes several key actions, such as the full implementation of the anti-corruption legislation passed in 2023, the development of an effective action plan, regular progress reviews every six months, and ensuring adequate budget provisions for the action plan. Additionally, the framework calls for the creation of a clear national anti-corruption strategy for the period 2025-2029. The framework also proposes amending the National Audit Act (No. 19 of 2018) to expand the legal authority of the Auditor General. This includes provisions for presenting full reports on investigative audits to Parliament and allowing the Auditor General to authorize criminal investigations into fraud and corruption revealed through such audits. Furthermore, the framework empowers the Auditor General to hold accountable, senior officials to levy surcharge, including those responsible for financial management, for failing to meet oversight and accountability standards. The National Anti-Corruption Framework suggests setting up a robust system for asset disclosure and conflict-of-interest management. It includes implementing regulations related to conflict-of-interest rules and asset disclosure procedures as outlined in the anti-corruption legislation. This framework will define what constitutes a conflict of interest, mandate public disclosure, provide guidelines for managing conflicts of interest, enforce penalties for officials who fail to comply, and require reporting on relevant performance. Additionally, it provides for the creation of a dedicated website for senior public officials to disclose their assets, in accordance with the anti-corruption law. The framework also mandates semi-annual and annual progress reviews of these processes. The framework further proposes the development of a national strategy and policies for the recovery of assets obtained through crime and money laundering. This includes providing necessary support for the effective functioning of the newly empowered Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption (CIABOC), ensuring proper handling of investigations and prosecutions, and addressing the identification of Politically Exposed Persons (PEPs). The National Anti-Corruption Agenda aims to significantly enhance investigations and prosecutions related to corruption cases. It outlines plans to develop regulations supporting transparency in company ownership by establishing a comprehensive beneficial ownership register. To promote transparency in public procurement, the agenda calls for the implementation of a public procurement law that aligns with international standards and requires the publication of information on procurement contracts exceeding one billion rupees. Additional measures include publicizing tax exemptions for all companies and temporarily suspending the Strategic Development Project Act until a proper process for evaluating investment promotion conditions and proposals is developed. The agenda also emphasizes the reform of public enterprises to ensure the creation of trained and independent staff, alongside implementing short-term anti-corruption measures by the Department of Government Revenue. Further reforms involve establishing new management functions for the Employee Provident Fund, removing its direct management by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka. It also focuses on strengthening corporate controls in government-owned banks by improving the selection process for executive and board members, and enforcing standards for the Judicial Service Commission. Additionally, the agenda includes provisions to enhance the right to information, ensuring greater transparency and accountability. The agenda also incorporates recommendations from the International Monetary Funds second review of the Extended Fund Facility, published on May 29, 2024, to strengthen the countrys anti-corruption framework. It suggests implementing measures to enhance the effectiveness of current anti-corruption efforts by focusing on several key areas. These include providing support for the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption (CIABOC), improving state revenue management, strengthening financial oversight and management of state assets, and preventing money laundering and the financing of terrorism. --PMD--",

        "date": "July 25, 2024 05:56 pm",
        "content": "The Public Financial Management Bill and the Economic Transformation Bill have been passed in Parliament today (25) with amendments and without a vote. Amendments were incorporated to the bills during the committee stage and subsequently, the third reading was passed without a vote. These two bills were presented to Parliament on 22 May 2024. The government says the two significant bills are aimed at bolstering the countrys economy. The Economic Transformation Bill and the Public Financial Management Bill, are designed to enhance the management of public finances, thereby safeguarding against future economic downturns, the State Minister of Finance Shehan Semasinghe said recently. Explaining the bills, he said the Economic Transformation Law, is aimed at preventing future economic collapses and that the legislation stems from the vision of President Ranil Wickremesinghe, rather than being proposed by the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The recent stabilization of the economy following previous downturns underscores the importance of preserving this stability going forward, he said, adding that it is necessary to maintain optimal levels of public financial management to avert future economic crises. The Public Finance Management Bill is set to be presented with a focus on enhancing accountability in managing public finances. This legislative initiative aligns with recommendations from a collaborative program with the IMF and holds significant importance for the countrys future financial management, the state minister said. He said these drafts contain numerous technical intricacies aimed at bolstering confidence in the economy and maintaining the trajectory of the new economic direction implemented thus far. Meanwhile, the Supreme Court recently determined that several clauses of the Economic Transformation Bill are inconsistent with the countrys Constitution. Consequently, these clauses require a special majority in parliament and, in some cases, approval by a referendum to be passed. However, if the contentious clauses are amended, they can be passed with a simple majority, the court said in its determination.",

        "date": "July 25, 2024 06:10 pm",
        "content": "Former Health Minister Keheliya Rambukwella and 05 other suspects implicated in the alleged importation of substandard immunoglobulin vials have been further remanded until August 08. The order was issued after the defendants were produced before the Maligakanda Magistrates Court today (25). The former Minister of Health is currently in remand custody in connection with his alleged complicity in the procurement of substandard human intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) vials. The Criminal Investigation Department (CID) arrested Rambukwella on 02 February over his alleged complicity in the procurement of substandard IVIG vials. The arrest came hot on the heels of pressure from civil society activists and health sector trade unionists, who called for the immediate apprehension of the lawmaker. In October 2023, the National Medicines Regulatory Authority (NMRA) revealed that forged documents were found to have been submitted for Customs clearance to procure a batch of vials containing human immunoglobulin, an antibody produced by blood plasma cells, which later failed the quality tests. Prior to the apprehension of Rambukwella, seven arrests had been made in connection with the drug procurement scam. But the fifth accused was later released on bail. As such, the former Health Secretary, the Director of the Health Ministrys Medical Supplies Division (MSD) and three other officials of the same division, as well as the owner of the company, which is said to have supplied the substandard batch of immunoglobulin vials, were in remand custody. Meanwhile, one of the suspects who was arrested and remanded in connection with the case was released on bail when the case was previously taken up on May 06. Accordingly, the former Deputy Director of the Medical Supplies Division of the Health Ministry, Dr. Thusitha Sudarshana had been released on bail. Meanwhile, the Court of Appeal today (25) ordered the Maligakanda Magistrates Court to release on bail the former Director of the Health Ministrys Medical Supplies Division, Dr. Kapila Wickramanayake, who was also in remand custody. The Court of Appeal had issued the order to the Maligakanda Magistrates Court to release Dr. Wickramanayake under suitable bail conditions, after considering a writ petition filed by his attorneys.",

        "date": "July 25, 2024 10:46 pm",
        "content": "The death toll from landslides in a remote region of southern Ethiopia has risen to 257, the United Nations said on Thursday, warning that the number of victims could soar to 500. Rescuers are pressing on with the grim search for bodies and survivors in the stricken locality of Kencho Shacha Gozdi, with crowds of distraught locals digging through a sea of mud often using just their bare hands and shovels. The death toll has risen to 257, as of July 24, the UNs humanitarian agency OCHA said in statement citing local authorities. The death toll is expected to rise to up to 500 people. OCHA said more than 15,000 people need to be evacuated because of the high risk of further landslides, including at least 1,320 children under the age of five and 5,293 pregnant women or new mothers. Aid has begun arriving in the isolated, hard-to-reach area, including four trucks of life-saving supplies from the Ethiopian Red Cross Society, it said. The landslide is the deadliest on record in Ethiopia, Africas second most populous nation which is often battered by climate-related disasters. Officials have said that most of the victims were buried after they rushed to help after the first landslide, which followed heavy rain on Sunday in the area roughly 480 km from the capital Addis Ababa -- about a 10-hour drive. Villagers carried bodies on makeshift stretchers while in a nearby tent women wailed as they sat near a row of bodies wrapped in shrouds being prepared for burial. OCHA said 12 people who sustained injuries had been taken to a local hospital, while at least 125 are displaced and sheltering with other local residents. The number of missing is not known. UN chief Antonio Guterres sent his condolences over the disaster, with his spokesman Stephane Dujarric saying he was deeply saddened. The United Nations and its partners are working closely with the Government, evaluating the humanitarian situation to determine the extent of the damage and assess the humanitarian needs of the affected population, Dujarric said. UN agencies are dispatching food, nutrition, health and other critical supplies to help people affected by the landslides. Senait Solomon, head of communications for the South Ethiopia regional government, told AFP on Wednesday that the landslide site was sloped and prone to disasters, adding that conservation work to protect the area, including tree planting, had been under way at the time of the landslides. More than 21 million people or about 18 per cent of the population rely on humanitarian aid in Ethiopia as a result of conflict and natural disasters such as flooding and drought. OCHA said earlier this week that that a similar but lower-scale landslide struck in May in the same area, killing more than 50 people. Seasonal rains in South Ethiopia state between April and early May had caused flooding, mass displacement and damage to livelihoods and infrastructure, it had said in May. In 2017, at least 113 people died when a mountain of garbage collapsed in a dump on the outskirts of Addis Ababa. The deadliest landslide in Africa was in Sierra Leones capital in Freetown in August 2017, when 1,141 people perished. Mudslides in the Mount Elgon region of eastern Uganda killed more than 350 people in February 2010. Source: AFP --Agencies",

        "date": "July 26, 2024 10:35 am",
        "content": "Mexican drug kingpin Ismael El Mayo Zambada and the son of his ex-partner, Joaquin El Chapo Guzman, were arrested on Thursday in El Paso, Texas, in a major coup for U.S. authorities that may also reshape the Mexican criminal landscape. Zambada is one of the most consequential traffickers in Mexicos history and co-founded the Sinaloa Cartel with El Chapo, who was extradited to the United States in 2017 and is serving a life sentence in a maximum security prison. Both Zambada and Joaquin Guzman Lopez, the son of El Chapo, face multiple charges in the U.S. for funneling huge quantities of drugs to U.S. streets, including fentanyl, which has surged to become the leading cause of death for Americans between the ages of 18 and 45. Zambada, who is believed to be in his 70s, and Guzman Lopez, who is in his 30s, were detained after landing in a private plane in the El Paso area, two U.S. officials told Reuters. Guzman Lopez is one of four sons of El Chapo -- known as Los Chapitos, or Little Chapos -- who inherited their fathers faction of the Sinaloa Cartel. His brother, Ovidio Guzman, was arrested last year and extradited to the United States. In recent years, the Sinaloa Cartel has become the biggest target for U.S. authorities, who have accused the crime syndicate of being the biggest supplier of fentanyl to the United States. Zambada and Guzman Lopez face multiple charges in the U.S. for heading the Cartels criminal operations, including its deadly fentanyl manufacturing and trafficking networks, U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement. The arrest of Guzman Lopez was first reported by Reuters, ahead of the Justice Department statement where it was confirmed they were detained in El Paso. One worker at the Santa Teresa airport, near El Paso, on Thursday afternoon told Reuters that he saw a Beechcraft King Air land on the runway, where federal agents were already waiting. Two individuals got off the plane and were calmly taken into custody, said the man, who declined to share his name out of concern for his safety. It seemed like a pretty calm, arranged thing, he added. The U.S. authorities had a 15 million reward for Zambadas capture, while Guzman Lopez had a 5 million bounty on his head. The Sinaloa cartel traffics drugs to more than 50 countries around the globe and is one of two most powerful organized crime groups in Mexico, according to U.S. authorities. Zambada and El Chapos sons belong to two different generations of traffickers, with differing styles. Zambada is known for being an old-school narco, avoiding the limelight and operating in the shadows. El Chapos sons, by contrast, have a reputation for being flashy narcos who courted attention as they ascended the ranks of the cartel. El Chapos sons are also known to be more violent and hot-headed than Zambada, who had a reputation as a shrewd operator. Zambada and El Chapos sons have had a fractious relationship since their father was extradited in 2017, and the arrests of Zambada and Guzman Lopez may trigger instability or even violence in their heartlands in the northern state of Sinaloa. Previous arrests of important cartel leaders has triggered violence as power vacuums open, leading to significant infighting within the organizations and between them and their rivals. This possibility certainly looms very large, said Vanda Felbab-Brown, a researcher at Washingtons Brookings Institution who closely monitors Mexican security. Their arrests were part of a joint operation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) agencies, HSI said in a statement. U.S. authorities have over the past year launched fresh indictments against Zambada and Guzmans sons on new charges in the United States that focus on fentanyl smuggling, as well as the flow of precursor chemicals to the illicit labs operated by their crime syndicate. Over decades, the cartel has set up sophisticated supply chains to move drugs across the globe and to source heavily regulated chemicals to their home base in Sinaloa. Earlier in the day on Thursday, Reuters published an investigation that revealed how fentanyl precursor chemicals are astonishingly easy and cheap to buy online from Chinese sellers that ship the substances door-to-door in North America. Fentanyl is the deadliest drug threat our country has ever faced, and the Justice Department will not rest until every single cartel leader, member, and associate responsible for poisoning our communities is held accountable, Garland added.

        "content": "The Speaker of the Parliament Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena has informed the Parliament that the decision to appoint the Inspector General of Police (IGP) was correct, legal, constitutional, and made in good faith. He further said that the situation with regard to the IGP cannot be resolved even by the President, and the matter must be sorted out in court if necessary. The Speaker made these comments following the special statement delivered in Parliament by the Prime Minister regarding the Supreme Court decision on the IGP. Speaking in Parliament this morning (26), PM Dinesh Gunawardena had clarified that the President has no legal provisions at this moment to appoint an Acting IGP. The Prime Minister also emphasized that the position of the IGP is not vacated presently. He also stated that the court cannot change the approval granted by the Constitutional Council to appoint the current IGP. We remind the Speaker and Parliament that the order of the Supreme Court suspending the duties of the IGP should be nullified. We request the Speaker to intervene as soon as possible in this regard, he said. The Supreme Court on Wednesday issued an interim order preventing Deshabandu Tennakoon from performing duties and functioning in the position of the IGP. The Supreme Court had issued this order after granting leave to proceed with the nine petitions, filed by several parties including Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith, challenging Tennakoons appointment as the IGP. The Supreme Court had also ordered the President to name a suitable person for the position of IGP, for the duration of the interim order being enforced against Deshabandu Tennakoon.",

        "content": "A Hamas leader in the West Bank died in Israeli custody after a deterioration in his health condition, a Palestinian governmental body said early on Friday. Mustafa Muhammad Abu Ara, 63, died after being transferred to a hospital from the Ramon jail in southern Israel, the Palestinian Commission of Detainees Affairs said in a statement. Before his arrest, he was suffering from serious health problems and needed intensive medical follow-up. However, from the moment of his arrest, Sheikh Abu Ara, like all prisoners, has faced unprecedented crimes ... since the beginning of the war of extermination. Abu Ara, who was arrested in October last year, was subjected to torture and deprived of medical treatment, the Palestinian body said. There was no immediate comment from Israel. At least 18 Palestinians have died in Israeli custody since the start of the Gaza war on Oct. 7, the Palestinian Prisoners Association said last month. Hamas-led attackers killed 1,200 people and took more than 250 captives, according to Israeli tallies. Some 120 hostages are still being held, though Israel believes a third of them are dead. Gaza health authorities say more than 39,000 Palestinians have been killed and most of Gazas 2.3 million people displaced by fighting that has destroyed much of the enclave and created a humanitarian disaster.

        "content": "Bangladeshs leader has been accused of crying crocodile tears after she was photographed weeping at a train station that was destroyed during anti-government protests. At leat 150 people have been killed as a result of nationwide clashes between police and university students, with security forces accused of execessive force. Protesters had been calling for quotas on government jobs to be scrapped. Online, many accused Ms Hasina of not expressing the same level of sympathy towards those who had died, or their families. The pictures were taken during Ms Hasinas visit to a metro rail station in the city of Mirpur on Thursday, where ticket vending machines and the signalling control station were shattered. Ms Hasina was pictured frowning and wiping her tears with tissue paper. What kind of mentality leads them to destroy facilities that make peoples lives easier? Dhaka city was clogged with traffic. The metro rail offered respite. I cannot accept the destruction of this transport facility made with modern technology, Bangladeshi daily The Business Standard quoted the prime minister as saying. These comments drew the ire of Bangladeshi internet users. We lost hundreds of students. But PM Sheikh Hasina had the time to go cry for a metro rail, not for the people who wont return ever again, said one Twitter user. Shedding crocodile tears for a railway track while others have died.... another chimed in. Journalist Zulkarnian Saer, who has in the past spoken out against the government, said: Hasina had the time to visit the vandalised train station, but she did not visit the families of the students... shot dead during protests. Some called the photographs an attempt to drive attention away from deaths from the protests. No doubt that she went there to ... get some attention and empathy, said one Facebook user. Security forces have been accused of using excessive force to quell the unrest, but Ms Hasina had instead blamed her political opponents for the wave of violence. Her government is working to suppress these militants and create a better environment, the 76-year-old said earlier this week, adding she was forced to impose a curfew for public safety.

        "content": "(AP)  High-speed trains around France were hit by several malicious acts Friday that heavily disrupted traffic on the day of the high-risk opening ceremony of the Paris Olympics, according to the national rail company SNCF. Travel to and from London beneath the English Channel, to neighboring Belgium, and across the west, north and east of France were affected by what SNCF called a series of coordinated overnight incidents. Government officials denounced the incidents hours before the opening ceremony of the Paris Olympics, which are happening around France, though there was no immediate sign of a link to the Games. National police said authorities are investigating what happened. French media reported a big fire on a busy western route. Transport Minister Patrice Vergriete said in a post on X that he firmly condemns these criminal incidents, and that SNCF is working to restore traffic. Sports Minister Amélie Oudéa-Castera said authorities are working to evaluate the impact on travelers, athletes, and ensure the transport of all delegations to the competition sites for the Olympics. Speaking on BFM television, she said, Playing against the Games is playing against France, against your own camp, against your country. She didnt identify who was behind the vandalism. Paris police chief Laurent Nunez, speaking on France Info radio, said he would send police reinforcement to overcrowded train stations in relation to the SNCF incidents. Passengers at St. Pancras station in London were warned to expect delays of around an hour to their Eurostar journeys. Announcements in the departure hall at the international terminus informed travelers heading to Paris that there was a problem with overhead power supplies. Source: AP --Agencies",

The incident had occurred while they were traveling in a three-wheeler when two unidentified gunmen had fired at them at around 5.50 p.m. last evening (25) before fleeing the scene. The woman, who was in critical condition, has succumbed to her injuries this morning (26) while being treated at the Colombo National Hospital. Police later confirmed that the driver of the three-wheeler had died at the scene. It has been reported that five gunshots had been fired at the woman, who has been identified as K. Suneetha also known as Grandpass Kudu Suneetha. Police further stated that she had been involved in a large-scale drug racket operation in the area and had been evading the police since the commencement of the Yukthiya anti-drug operation. Additionally, it is also reported that there are several pending court cases against her on drug-related charges. The driver of the three-wheeler, a 31-year-old resident of the Kamburupitiya area, who was also killed in the shooting, is said to be a relative of the woman and had assisted her in the drug racket. Meanwhile, police have found a motorcycle this afternoon (26) which is suspected to have been used by the gunmen, abandoned in the Orugodawatta area.

        "date": "July 26, 2024 03:48 pm",
        "content": "The Supreme Court today (26) ordered to issue notice on the Election Commission, the Justice Minister, and several others, to present their facts before the court regarding a petition filed seeking the release of a set of guidelines providing facilities for remand prisoners to vote in elections including the Presidential Election. The court has issued this order to the attorney of the petitioner, former-prisoner Sudesha Nandimal de Silva, when his petition seeking voting rights for remand prisoners was taken up for consideration today. Accordingly, the court ordered to issue notice on the Chairman of the Election Commission and its members, Minister of Justice Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe, the Commissioner General of Prisons, and other respondents named in the petition, asking them to appear before the court on August 8. The petitioner claims that under the countrys Constitution, a person is presumed innocent until convicted by a court of law and is therefore entitled to all fundamental rights guaranteed by the Constitution. He referenced the United Nations charter on human rights, which states that all prisoners shall be treated with the respect due to their inherent dignity and value as human beings and provided with all the privileges enjoyed by the average persons. The petition points out that Article 89 of the Constitution clearly stipulates which prisoners are ineligible to vote, and that this excludes remand suspects who have not been convicted by a court. Therefore, the petitioner argues that there is no legal obstacle preventing remand suspects from exercising their franchise. The petitioner highlighted that he was unable to vote in past elections due to being in remand prison for several years and mentioned that a significant number of remand prisoners have lost their democratic right to vote. He revealed that there are more than 20,000 eligible voters in remand prisons. The petitioner further requested the Supreme Court to order the Election Commission to issue a set of guidelines to the relevant parties, ensuring that remand prisoners can exercise their right to vote in the upcoming elections.",

We called to say Michelle and I couldnt be prouder to endorse you and to do everything we can to get you through this election and into the Oval Office, Obama told Harris. I am proud of you. This is going to be historic, the former first lady told Harris. Talking into a cell phone and cracking a few smiles, Harris expressed her gratitude for the endorsement and their long friendship. Thank you both. It means so much. And were gonna have some fun with this too, Harris said. The campaign said the video was the actual call, not a reenactment. Harriss surprise bid against Republican rival Donald Trump continues to gain steam from supporters, donors and politicians less than a week after President Joe Biden bowed out of the race amid slumping poll numbers. Obama, the first US Black president, remains one of the most popular figures in the Democratic party even after more than a decade has passed since he was last elected. Obama has lent his support to Biden during big-money fundraisers, which were among some of the biggest blockbuster events of his campaign. The endorsement could help activate and sustain energy and fundraising for Harris campaign and it signals he is likely to get on the campaign trail for Harris once she is officially the presumptive nominee. Obama initially withheld his endorsement even as Biden, his former vice president, anointed her as his heir apparent. Obama reportedly did not want to put his thumb on the scale as the party worked through the process of determining its nominee. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "content": "High Commissioner of Sri Lanka, Ambassador Admiral (R) Ravindra C Wijegunaratne on Friday said the people of Sri Lanka esteemed Pakistan as a friendly country unlike any other nation for its unprecedented support against terrorism. He was addressing the Institute of Regional Studies (IRS)s seminar on Building on Pakistan-Sri Lanka Cooperation in Islamabad as the keynote speaker. Ambassador Ravindra said Sri Lankas Prime Minister and the worlds first female premier Sirimavo Bandaranaike despite her close relationship with her Indian counterpart Indira Gandhi gave safe passage and permission to Pakistan to use its airspace and Colombo air base during its 1971 War. However, Sri Lank fought thirty years long worst war against the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), he said, adding, No nation supported us like Pakistan in this war and we have memory like elephants to keep it intact in our minds. The Pakistan Armed Forces, he said had forged deep ties with the Sri Lankan military that played a crucial and decisive part in the war against LTTE. Sri Lanka, he said had 74 Buddhist,16 Muslims and the remaining part of population comprising of Hindus. Pakistan is sitting on a goldmine of Gandhara civilization based Buddhist site whereas 9.3 million Buddhist globally visit their religious sites world over that can be tapped by Pakistan to benefit its tourism sector and national economy, he suggested. Sri Lankan nation, he said is the largest exporter of eye cornea and had exported around 88,000 corneas world over with more than 36,000 sent to Pakistan. Every Sri Lankan writes in his last will that if possible his or her eyes be donated to a Pakistani, he added. Commenting on the mutually shared cultural affinities between the friendly nations, he said the Lankan nations religion is cricket. Sri Lanka has great curiosity of having green shirts facing Sri Lankas women cricket team in Asia Cup semi finals and wants Pakistan to defeat India in the finals. Ambassador Ravindra mentioned that there were 120 items that could be imported and exported without tax after the free trade agreement (FTA) of Pakistan with Sri Lanka. He said, We have no direct flights between the two countries as theres very low competition among the local and regional players. It needs to be addressed to boost tourism and close tries. LOLC microfinance bank of Sri Lanka has 85 branches in Pakistan including one in the federal capital that is supporting small entrepreneurs particularly females to get easy loans for their businesses, he said. In his opening remarks, President IRS, Ambassador Jauhar Saleem said the relationships between Pakistan and Sri Lanka have been cordial since independence. He added that South Asia would have been a different region if the entire region had such level of ties. During times of conflict and peace both the countries helped each other whereas their position and terms on key matters at international foras has been tremendous, he added. He mentioned that both the nations had witnessed improved trade and investment cooperation in recent years, whereas Pakistans Buddhism tourism potential demands to build a dialogue on it. Ambassador Saleem said, Sri Lankan foreign minister is coming to Pakistan after a hiatus of two years after the Covid-19 pandemic that would resume bilateral talks. He commended that the Sri Lankan ambassador is very popular in Pakistan and got the highest award of Nishan-i-Imtiaz. Ambassador Seema Elahi Baloch former high commissioner to Sri Lanka said the country helped Pakistan graciously during dengue outbreak in Punjab. However, We have been supporting each other internationally at global foras and will continue to do so. The Defence Cooperation between the two is important and will be galvanized further, whereas at the moment both the nations have 1 billion trade volume that can be scaled up to 2.7 billion, she added. She underlined that there was a lot of scope for joint ventures to explore pharmaceutical, ayurvedic, plastics and textiles potential. She noted that encouraging trade links and businesses needed environmental trust with appropriate information, whereas there was no media and cultural exchanges between Sri Lanka and Pakistan that were important in that regard. Tourism and hospitality industry is one of the mainstays of Sri Lanka. It can guide us on keeping tourist attractions neat and clean, and develop sustainable and eco-friendly hoteling infrastructure, she added. Ambassador Baloch also called for promotion of drama and film exchange with the aim to focus on culture and media collaborations to improve economic cooperation through public diplomacy. Former Ambassador to Sri Lanka, and head of Pakistan Institute of Conflict and Security Studies, Major General (R) Saad Khattak delivered a detailed presentation on geography, demography, history, defence collaboration and economic engagement between Pakistan and Sri Lanka. Pak-Sri Lanka trade is hovering around 400-500 million despite a billion dollars potential despite FTA in 2005 which needs to be enhanced whereas both nations have similar security threats internally and externally, he added. He mentioned that Pak-Sri Lanka ties remained security centric throughout that made the countrys relevance decreasing amid the latters policy shift over geoeconomics. He highlighted that the attitude of both the countries leadership and bureaucracy was taking toll on the current ties that demanded diversification of ties and proactive leadership in the foreign office domain. Prof Dr Shaheen Akhtar HOD at National Defence University (NDU) said Sri Lankans admire and love Pakistanis at the grassroots level. She shared her memories during her fellowship in Sri Lanka. She added that both nations have religious, cultural connectivity and social affinity but despite all commonalities there was lack of full scale cooperation, whereas trade and investment needed to be promoted through joint ventures especially in the textile sector. DG South Asia and SAARC, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Illyas Mehmood Nizami said Sri Lanka has achieved great human development with limited resources whereas political good will and commitment on both sides was the basis of cordial and robust relationships between the two nations. Sri Lanka was the first country in the world with which Pakistan signed its first FTA. We should also focus on services exports and trade as well as defence is another important dimension of this relationship, he added. He mentioned that on Buddhism and shared history, the Ministry was working on this important aspect and thats why it had hosted an international symposium to showcase Gandhara Civilization potential. The Sri Lankan Minister for Religious Affairs and high ranking monks participated in that seminar, he added. Source: APP --Agencies",

The hosts chased down the 141-run target in the last over which was bowled by Pakistans skipper Nida Dar. Sri Lanka needed three off six balls in the last over but Dars impressive display made it somewhat difficult for the home side.

During their chase, Sri Lanka suffered initially as they lost two of their batters Vishmi Gunaratne and Harshitha Samarawickrama and were 19-2 in just four overs. However, skipper Chamari Athapaththu played a leaders knock which guided Sri Lanka near to victory. She scored 63 runs on 48 balls with 10 boundaries. Down the order, Anushka Sanjeewani provided crucial 24 runs and the Islanders chased the target with one ball to spare. For Pakistan, Sadia Iqbal bagged four wickets while Dar and Omaima Sohail took one each. Sri Lanka will now face India in the final on July 28 in Dambulla. After being asked to bat first, Pakistan had a decent start as their openers Gull Feroza and Muneeba Ali  continued to play with caution and kept scoring without much trouble. Feroza and Muneeba formed a 61-run partnership before the former was dismissed by Udeshika Prabodhani for 25 runs. The latter followed her opening partner in the same over after scoring 37 runs on 34 balls. Sidra Amin came at number three but she could not do much as well as she lost her wicket after 10 runs off 13 deliveries. Skipper Nida Dar played a great and quick knock, scoring 23 runs on 17 balls and her valiant display was continued by Fatima Sana (23 off 17) and Aliya Riaz (16 off 15) as the late contributions by the batters helped Pakistan post a 141-run target. For Sri Lanka, Udeshika Prabodhani and Kavisha Dilhari bagged two wickets each.

        "date": "July 27, 2024 11:49 am",
        "content": "Vice President Kamala Harris on Thursday said she urged Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to reach a cease-fire deal soon with Hamas so that dozens of hostages held by the militants in Gaza since Oct. 7 can return home. Harris said she had a frank and constructive conversation with Netanyahu in which she affirmed Israels right to defend itself but also expressed deep concern about the high death toll in Gaza over nine months of war and the dire humanitarian situation there. With all eyes on the likely Democratic presidential nominee, Harris largely reiterated President Joe Bidens longstanding message that its time to find an endgame to the brutal war in Gaza, where more than 39,000 Palestinians have died. Yet she offered a more forceful tone about the urgency of the moment just one day after Netanyahu gave a fiery speech to Congress in which he defended the war, vowed total victory against Hamas and made relatively scant mention of cease-fire negotiations. There has been hopeful movement in the talks to secure an agreement on this deal, Harris told reporters shortly after meeting with Netanyahu. And as I just told Prime Minister Netanyahu, it is time to get this deal done. Netanyahu met separately earlier in the day with Biden, who has also been calling on Israel and Hamas to come to an agreement on a U.S.-backed, three-phase deal to bring home remaining hostages and establish an extended cease-fire. The White House said in a statement that Biden discussed with Netanyahu the need to close the remaining gaps, finalize the deal as soon as possible, bring the hostages home, and reach a durable end to the war in Gaza. Biden and Netanyahu also discussed improving the flow of aid into Gaza as well as the ongoing threat posed by Iranian-backed militant groups, including Hamas, Hezbollah and the Houthis. Harris said after her meeting with Netanyahu that Israels war in Gaza is more complicated than simply being supportive of one side or the other. Too often, the conversation is binary when the reality is anything but, Harris said. Harris also condemned Hamas brutality. White House national security spokesperson John Kirby reiterated the administration position that the militant group that killed some 1,200 on Oct. 7 and kidnapped 250 people from Israel ultimately holds responsibility for the suffering in Gaza and must come to terms with Israel. Kirby added that gaps between the two sides can be closed but there are issues that need to be resolved that will require some leadership, some compromise. With Harris forceful comments, the administration also appeared to be stepping up pressure on the Israelis to not let the moment pass to get a deal done. What has happened in Gaza over the past nine months is devastating. The images of dead children and desperate, hungry people fleeing for safety, sometimes displaced for the second, third or fourth time, Harris said. We cannot look away in the face of these tragedies. We cannot allow ourselves to become numb to the suffering. And I will not be silent. Thousands protested Netanyahus visit in Washington, and Harris condemned those who were violent or used rhetoric that praised Hamas. Netanyahu, last at the White House when former President Donald Trump was in office, is headed to Florida on Friday to meet with the Republican presidential nominee. Ahead of the Harris-Netanyahu meeting Thursday, Trump said at a rally in North Carolina the vice president was totally against the Jewish people. Harris has long spoken of her strong support for Israel. The first overseas trip of her Senate career in early 2017 was to Israel, and one of her first acts in office was to introduce a resolution opposing a U.N. Security Council resolution condemning Israel. Shes also spoken of her personal ties to Israel, including memories of raising money as a child to plant trees in Israel and installing a mezuzah near the front door of the vice presidents residence in Washington  her husband is Jewish. She also has connections to pro-Israel groups including the conservative American Israel Public Affairs Committee and the liberal J Street. For Harris, the meeting with Netanyahu was an opportunity to demonstrate that she has the mettle to serve as commander in chief. Shes being scrutinized by those on the political left who say Biden hasnt done enough to force Netanyahu to end the war and by Republicans looking to brand her as insufficient in her support for Israel. Harris last one-on-one engagement with Netanyahu was in March 2021, but shes taken part in more than 20 calls between Biden and Netanyahu. The conservative Likud Party leader Netanyahu and centrist Democrat Biden have had ups-and-downs over the years. Netanyahu, in what will likely be his last White House meeting with Biden, reflected on the roughly 40 years theyve known each other and thanked the president for his service. From a proud Jewish Zionist to a proud Irish American Zionist, I want to thank you for 50 years of public service and 50 years of support for the state of Israel, Netanyahu told Biden. A U.S.-backed proposal to release remaining hostages in Gaza over three phases is something that would be a legacy-affirming achievement for Biden, who abandoned his reelection bid and endorsed Harris. It could also be a boon for Harris in her bid to succeed him. Following their talks, Biden and Netanyahu met with the families of American hostages. Jonathan Dekel-Chen, the father of hostage Sagui Dekel-Chen, said the families received an ironclad commitment from Biden and Netanyahu to get the hostages home. He said he was more hopeful than at anytime since Hamas released more than 100 hostages during a temporary cease-fire in November. There is more reason today than in any time since the last round of hostage releases that something can happen, he said. Netanyahu is trying to navigate his own delicate political moment. He faces pressure from the families of hostages demanding a cease-fire agreement to bring their loved ones home and from far-right members of his governing coalition who demand he resist any deal that could keep Israeli forces from eliminating Hamas. In his speech to a joint session of Congress on Wednesday, Netanyahu offered a robust defense of Israels conduct during the war and lashed out against accusations by the International Criminal Court of Israeli war crimes. He made the case that Israel, in its fight against Iran-backed Hamas, was effectively keeping Americans boots off the ground while protecting our shared interests in the Middle East. Remember this: Our enemies are your enemies, Netanyahu said. Our fight, its your fight. And our victory will be your victory.  Netanyahu also derided protesters who massed near the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday, calling them Irans useful idiots. Harris on Thursday said she was outraged that some protesters tagged areas near the U.S. Capitol with pro-Hamas graffiti, expressed support for the militants and burned a U.S. flag at Union Station. Pro-Hamas graffiti and rhetoric is abhorrent and we must not tolerate it in our nation, Harris said in a statement. I condemn the burning of the American flag. That flag is a symbol of our highest ideals as a nation and represents the promise of America. It should never be desecrated in that way. Protesters massed near the White House on Thursday chanted, Arrest Netanyahu, and brought an effigy of the prime minister with blood on its hands and wearing an orange jumpsuit. A small number of counterprotesters wore Israeli flags around their shoulders. Source: The Associated Press --Agencies",

        "date": "July 27, 2024 12:11 pm",
        "content": "A team of divers discovered a 19th-century shipwreck off the coast of Sweden that was loaded to the sides with historical artifacts  including 100 bottles of champagne. The shipwreck was discovered in the Baltic Sea, about 20 nautical miles off the Swedish coast, by a team of Polish technical divers from the group Baltictech. We encountered a 19th-century sailing ship in very good condition, loaded to the sides with champagne, wine, mineral water and porcelain, Baltictech diver Tomasz Stachura said in a press release this week. Stachura said it was difficult for divers to determine exactly how much bubbly was aboard the ship but confirmed they certainly saw more than 100 bottles. Interestingly, it wasnt the alcohol that piqued the divers interests, but rather the mineral water in clay bottles, which Stachura said was treated almost like medicine and only found its way to royal tables in the 19th century. Its value was so precious that transports were escorted by the police, Stachura added. Historians determined that the stamp on the mineral water, which hails from the German brand Selters, was produced between 1850 and 1867, according to Stachura, who has been in contact with the brand, which is still in business. The pottery factory into which the water was bottled also exists, and we are in contact with them to find out more details, Stachura said. When the team initially spotted the wreck via sonar on July 11, they believed it was a fishing boat, according to Stachura. We were already after one dive that day and at first, there were doubts whether there would be anyone willing to go down, Stachura said, before adding fellow divers Marek Cacaj and Pawel Truszynski decided to take the now-historic plunge. For now, the shipwreck remains in the Baltic Sea outside of economic waters, according to Stachura, who is collaborating regarding the wreck with the Marie-Stella-Maris Foundation, Södertörn University, and Professor Johan Rönnby, who is in charge of all underwater research in Sweden.

        "date": "July 27, 2024 01:45 pm",
        "content": "The Bar Association of Sri Lanka (BASL) has condemned the recent government actions aimed at undermining the Supreme Courts interim order concerning the appointment of the Inspector General of Police (IGP) Deshabandu Tennakoon. Issuing a statement in this regard, the BASL emphasized the governments claim that the Supreme Court does not have power to call into question appointments made by the President which are approved by the Constitutional Council is totally untenable in view of the BASL. In its statement, the BASL highlighted: The decisions of the Constitutional Council are clearly amenable to the Fundamental Rights Jurisdiction of the Supreme Court (as per Article 411 of the Constitution). It is equally clear that following the 19th Amendment to the Constitution, the exercise of powers by the President, except his power to declare war and peace, are subject to the Fundamental Rights Jurisdiction of the Supreme Court (as per Article 35 of the Constitution). The association further claimed that in the said cases, a three-judge bench of the Supreme Court heard all parties including the Attorney General and counsel for IGP Tennekoon and delivered its order granting leave to proceed, adding that the Court also issued an interim order restraining Mr. Tennekoon from exercising the duties, functions and powers of the Inspector General of Police until the final determination of the applications. The said cases had been fixed for hearing on 11th November, 2024, with the consent of all parties including the Attorney General and all counsel, it added. The BASL highlighted that the Supreme Courts authority to review presidential appointments is firmly established within the framework of Sri Lankas Constitution. This includes oversight of decisions by the Constitutional Council under Article 411 and the Presidents powers, as modified by the 19th Amendment, under Article 35, the statement mentioned. The BASL referenced historical judgments to support their position: In the case of Edward Siva V Dr. Shirani Bandaranaike 1997(1) SLR 92 a seven-judge bench of the Supreme Court held as follows, quoting with approval the decision of the Supreme Court in Bandara v Premachandra 1994(1) SLR 301. In common with Courts in other democracies founded on the Rule of Law, this Court has consistently recognised that powers of appointment are not absolute: There are no absolute or unfettered discretions in public law; discretions are conferred on public functionaries in trust for the public, to be used for the public good, and the propriety of the exercise of such discretions is to be judged by reference to the purposes for which they were so entrusted, it added. Reaffirming the judiciarys independence, the BASL stressed that the Supreme Courts decisions cannot be overruled by any other body, including the Prime Minister or the Speaker of the House. The Association warned that any failure by the government to respect court decisions would erode public confidence in justice and jeopardize democracy. Moreover, the BASL expressed its fullest confidence in the judiciary of Sri Lanka including the Supreme Court and will stand by the judiciary in order to ensure that its integrity is protected at this critical hour.",

        "content": "A new police unit on election related affairs has reportedly been established at the Police Headquarters with an Officer-In-Charge (OIC) also appointed to lead the relevant unit. Meanwhile, it was reported that in addition to the Senior Deputy Inspector of Police (SDIG) Asanga Karavita, another DIG and a Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) have been assigned to oversee duties related to the upcoming Presidential Election. Accordingly, DIG P. Liyanage and SSP K.D.G.L.A Dharmasena have been assigned the relevant duties, as per reports. On Wednesday (24), the Supreme Court issued an interim order preventing Deshabandu Tennakoon from performing duties and functioning in the position of the IGP. The Supreme Court had issued this order after granting leave to proceed with the nine petitions, filed by several parties including Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith, challenging Tennakoons appointment as the IGP. The Supreme Court had also ordered the President to name a suitable person for the position of IGP, for the duration of the interim order being enforced against Deshabandu Tennakoon. However, the Commissioner General of Elections earlier said that the issues pertaining to the IGP post will not affect the holding of elections, as SDIG Asanga Karavita has already been assigned to oversee the election-related duties.",

        "date": "July 27, 2024 04:54 pm",
        "content": "More details have been revealed regarding the incident where a man was found stabbed to death with sharp weapons inside a parked three-wheeler at Ward Place in Colombo on July 23, following the interrogation of the arrested suspects. Two suspects were arrested by the Colombo Crimes Division (CCD) in connection with the incident. The suspects were apprehended following an extensive investigation by several police units, including the Organized Crime Investigation Unit of the CCD. The breakthrough came through the analysis of CCTV footage, which led officers to arrest the suspects on July 26, during a search operation at Samagi Mawatha, Grandpass. The suspects, aged 35 and 48, are residents of Gonawila and Grandpass, according to police. Upon their arrest, authorities found 30 grams and 200 milligrams of crystal methamphetamine, commonly known as Ice, in their possession. Interrogations revealed that the suspects targeted the three-wheeler driver with the intention of stealing his mobile phone to fund their drug addiction. On the morning of July 23, they had arrived at Ward Place in a stolen three-wheeler from the Sapugaskanda area. After spotting the victim on a phone call, they decided to rob him. During the subsequent altercation, one suspect had stabbed the driver in the chest with a sharp weapon. Following the attack, the driver fell onto the road, but the suspects had placed him back in the three-wheeler before fleeing with his mobile phone. The stolen phone was later pawned for Rs. 4,000, which was used to purchase the Ice drugs. Police have recovered both the weapon used in the attack and the stolen three-wheeler. Authorities are now seeking a third suspect believed to be involved in the crime.",

        "content": "The Marvel duo of Deadpool  Wolverine grabbed 38.5 million at U.S. and Canadian box offices in the first screenings of the film on Thursday, distributor Walt Disney said. The early returns, a record for an R-rated movie, suggest Disney will enjoy its second hit in a row in a turnaround for its movie division. The opening-day tally ranks as the eighth-highest of all time, behind films such as Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker and Avengers: Infinity War. By Sunday, Deadpool  Wolverine is expected to claim the largest domestic box office opening of 2024, according to industry analysts. U.S. and Canadian sales through Sunday should hit between 175 million and 185 million, said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst at Comscore. That would top Inside Out 2, Disneys animated Pixar movie that debuted with 154.2 million in June. Deadpool  Wolverine, the first R-rated Marvel film by Disney, stars Ryan Reynolds as Deadpool, a character known for sexually explicit jokes, swearing and violence. Hugh Jackman plays Wolverine, a sharp-clawed mutant. The movie opened in international markets on Wednesday and has brought in 64.8 million outside of the United States and Canada, Disney said. Disney is rebounding from lackluster performances in 2023 for movies such as The Marvels and Haunted Mansion. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "title": "Israeli airstrike hits school sheltering people in Gaza, killing at least 30",
        "date": "July 27, 2024 07:11 pm",
        "content": "Israeli airstrikes hit a school being used by displaced people in central Gaza on Saturday, killing dozens, as the countrys negotiators prepared to meet international mediators to discuss a proposed cease-fire. At least 30 people sheltering at a girls school in Deir Al-Balah were taken to Al Aqsa Hospital and pronounced dead after a strike that Israels military said targeted a Hamas command and control center used to store weapons and plan attacks. It said militants used the compound as a hiding place to direct and plan numerous attacks against IDF troops and developed and stored large quantities of weapons inside. Civil defense workers in Gaza said that thousands were sheltering in the school, which also contained a medical site. Near the hospital, where the bodies were transported, Associated Press journalists saw an ambulance rushing through a dusty road as a few people ran in the opposite direction. An injured man lay on a stretcher on the ground. A body covered with a blanket and a dead toddler lay inside the ambulance. Inside the school, classrooms were in ruins. People were seen searching for victims under the rubble and some were gathering the remains of those who were killed. Gazas Health Ministry said at least 12 people had been killed in other strikes on Saturday. The strikes hit a day before officials from the U.S., Egypt, Qatar and Israel are scheduled to meet in Italy to discuss the ongoing hostage and cease-fire negotiations. CIA Director Bill Burns is expected to meet Qatari Prime Minister Mohammed Bin Abdul Rahman al-Thani, Mossad director David Barnea and Egyptian spy chief Abbas Kamel on Sunday, according to officials from the U.S. and Egypt who spoke on condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to discuss the plans. U.S. officials said on Friday that Israel and Hamas are in agreement on the basic framework of the three-phase deal under consideration. However, in Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahus speech to the U.S. Congress, he vowed to press forward with the war until Israel achieves total victory. Palestinian officials vehemently condemned the speech after the school strike. Nabil Abu Rudeineh, spokesperson for Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, said in a statement that Netanyahus reception from his supporters in the United States constituted a green light to continue Israels offensive. Every time the occupation bombs a school that shelters displaced persons, we see only some condemnations and denunciations that will not force the occupation to stop its bloody aggression, he said. Humanitarian zone evacuated ahead of strikes Earlier, Israels military ordered the evacuation of a part of a designated humanitarian zone in Gaza ahead of a planned strike on Khan Younis on Saturday. The evacuation order was in response to rocket fire that Israel said originated from the area. The military said it planned an operation against Hamas militants in the city, including parts of Muwasi, the crowded tent camp in an area where Israel has told thousands of Palestinians to seek refuge throughout the war. Its the second evacuation order issued in a week that has included striking part of the humanitarian zone, a 60-square-kilometer (roughly 20-square-mile) blanketed with tent camps that lack sanitation and medical facilities and have limited access to aid, United Nations and humanitarian groups say. Israel expanded the zone in May to take in people fleeing Rafah, where more than half of Gazas population at the time had crowded. Gaza Health Ministry officials said the evacuation orders had forced at least three health centers to stop providing care and compounded existing issues such as displaced people crammed in places where waste has piled up and hygiene kits are unavailable. According to Israeli estimates, about 1.8 million Palestinians are currently sheltering there after being uprooted multiple times in search of safety during Israels punishing air and ground campaign. In November, the military said the area could still be struck and that it was not a safe zone, but it is a safer place than any other in Gaza. The U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, known as UNRWA, said it was increasingly difficult to know how many people would be affected by the evacuation order because those sheltering under there were constantly being displaced. Referring to the orders as evacuation orders dont do any justice to what this means, said Juliette Touma, the agencys director of communications. These are forced displacement orders. What happens is when people have these orders, they have very little time to move. Further north, Palestinians mourned the deaths of seven killed by Israeli airstrikes overnight on Zawaida, in central Gaza. Members of two families  parents and their two children as well as a mother and her two children  were wrapped in traditional Islamic white burial shrouds as community members gathered to perform funeral rights. As men lined up to pray in front of the bodies, weeping friends and neighbors approached individually to pay their final respects. Deir al-Balahs Al Aqsa Hospital confirmed the count and Associated Press journalists saw the bodies. The war in Gaza has killed more than 39,200 Palestinians, according to the territorys Health Ministry, which doesnt distinguish between combatants and civilians in its count. The U.N. estimated in February that some 17,000 children in the territory are now unaccompanied, and the number is likely to have grown since. The war began with an assault by Hamas militants on southern Israel on Oct. 7 that killed 1,200 people, most of them civilians, and took about 250 hostages. About 115 are still in Gaza, about a third of them believed to be dead, according to Israeli authorities. Source: The Associated Press --Agencies",

Speaking further, the NPP Leader said: The NPP must establish a government that has the trust of the Tamil, Muslim and Sinhala communities. Creating a united government is the expectation of the NPP. Winning the election with the Sinhala votes alone is not enough for us. To win, Sinhala votes are enough. However, such a victory is not enough for us. We want to form a government to develop this country. Our movement is not exclusively focused on winning elections. Our movement does politics in the interest of truth. Whenever any community faced discrimination, our movement stood with them against such discrimination. We first call on you to establish a united government, Dissanayake added. Additionally, he added: Ranil Wickremesinghe is going against court verdicts. While it is true that he is in power now, he is also about to lose power in the near future. What happened yesterday is enough in itself to disqualify him from holding power again. On the other hand, is Sajith Premadasa. I really dont talk about him that much now.

        "title": "Womens Asia Cup Final: Sri Lanka to face seven-time champions India today",
        "date": "July 28, 2024 10:40 am",
        "content": "Defending champions India will look to translate their overwhelming dominance in the Womens Asia Cup to a record-extending eighth title while facing a feisty Sri Lanka in the final here on Sunday. India have lorded over their opponents in this continental showpiece  hammering Pakistan by seven wickets and followed it up with facile wins over UAE (78 runs), Nepal (82 runs), and Bangladesh (10 wickets). Indias top-order batters and bowlers fired in tandem, not giving their rivals even an iota of chance to mount a fight. Openers Smriti Mandhana and Shafali Verma have scored well in excess of 100 runs and at a healthy strike-rate of over 140, giving India solidity and quick starts alike at the top. But the management could be even more pleased with the way bowlers responded to the challenge, particularly Deepti Sharma and Renuka Singh. Deepti is the leading wicket-taker of this event with nine wickets and Renuka is third on the chart with seven scalps. But their economy rate across four matches has been brilliant  4.37 and 4.31 respectively. It ensured that the opposition batters have no breathing space at the top or in the middle-overs, phases when Renuka and Deepti often operate. It has also aided other bowlers, as batters often look for relief shots against them, and left-arm spinner Radha Yadav offers a prime example. She has taken six wickets at an economy of 5.5, while feeding on the success of her senior colleagues success. While there is no palpable worry in the Indian camp, they may just be a tad concerned about the lack of batting time for skipper Harmanpreet Kaur and Jemimah Rodrigues. Harmanpreet has batted just twice in three matches, even though she made a riveting 66 in one of them, while Rodrigues is yet to hit the top gear here in three innings. The think tank will hope that these experienced campaigners can find their range, if the situation comes to that. They might not have got that much time in the middle, but everyone is working hard at nets, and I am sure they will fire when the time comes, wicketkeeper batter Richa Ghosh had said. On the other hand, Sri Lanka too are undefeated in this event and they also have scored the biggest victory in terms of runs  a 144-run toweling of Malaysia in the group stage. The primary reason behind their supremacy is the fine form of skipper Chamari Athapathuthu, the leading run-scorer here with 243 runs. But it also has a bleaker side to it. Apart from Athapathuthu none of their batters have scored over 100 runs with Rushmi Gunarathne a distant second for them with 91 runs. Their bowling too offers a similar story. Except off-spinner Kavisha Dilhari (7 wickets, economy 5.35), others Lankan bowlers have failed to make an impact as yet. In that context, the Islanders will require a quick all-round improvement against a settled India to have a smidgeon of chance even to stretch them. Teams: India: Harmanpreet Kaur (c), Smriti Mandhana (vc), Shafali Verma, Deepti Sharma, Jemimah Rodrigues, Richa Ghosh (wk), Uma Chetry (wk), Pooja Vastrakar, Arundhati Reddy, Renuka Singh Thakur, Dayalan Hemalatha, Asha Sobhana, Radha Yadav, Shreyanka Patil, Sajana Sajeevan.

        "title": "Israel says Hezbollah rocket kills 12 at football ground, vows response",
        "date": "July 28, 2024 11:07 am",
        "content": "A rocket attack on a football ground in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights killed 12 people including children on Saturday, Israeli authorities said, blaming Hezbollah and vowing to inflict a heavy price on the Iran-backed Lebanese group. Hezbollah denied any responsibility for the strike, the deadliest in Israel or Israeli-annexed territory since the start of the conflict in Gaza. The attack sharply escalated tensions in the hostilities which have been fought in parallel to the Gaza war and has raised fears of a full-blown conflict between the heavily armed adversaries. The rocket struck a football pitch in the Druze village of Majdal Shams in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights, territory captured from Syria by Israel in the 1967 Middle East war and annexed in a move not recognised by most countries. Hezbollah will pay a heavy price, the kind it has thus far not paid, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a phone call with the leader of the Druze community in Israel, according to a statement from his office. In a written statement, Hezbollah said: The Islamic Resistance has absolutely nothing to do with the incident, and categorically denies all false allegations in this regard. Hezbollah had earlier announced several rocket attacks targeting Israeli military positions. The Israeli ambulance service said 13 more people were wounded by the rocket that hit the soccer pitch which was filled at the time with children and teenagers. They were playing soccer, they heard sirens they ran to shelter...it may take them like 15 seconds (to reach the shelter). But they couldnt reach the shelter because the rocket hit the site between the ground and the shelter, said Mourhaf Abu Saleh, a witness. Footage posted on social media showed the moment the rocket hit. An air raid siren can be heard, followed by a big explosion and images of smoke rising. Reuters was able to independently verify the location with the buildings and road layout that matched the satellite imagery of the area. Idan Avshalom, a medic with the Magen David Adom ambulance service, said first responders arrived to a scene of great destruction. There were casualties on the grass and the scene was gruesome, he said. Netanyahu, already due to head back from the United States to Israel overnight on Saturday, said he would bring his flight forward and convene his security cabinet upon arrival. The United States, which has been leading diplomatic efforts aimed at de-escalating the conflict across the Lebanese-Israeli border, condemned it as a horrific attack and said U.S. support for Israels security was iron-clad and unwavering against all Iranian backed terrorist groups, including Lebanese Hezbollah. The United States will continue to support efforts to end these terrible attacks along the Blue Line, which must be a top priority, the spokesperson for the White House National Security Council said in a statement. The Blue Line refers to the frontier between Lebanon and Israel. Moscow, which has ties with most of the key players in the Middle East, including Israel, Iran, the Palestinian Authority and Hamas, condemned the attacks in the Golan Heights. We condemn all terrorist actions undertaken by any entity, Russian TASS state news agency cited Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov as saying on Sunday. IRANIAN MISSILE The Israeli military said the rocket launch was carried out from an area located north of the village of Chebaa in southern Lebanon. Speaking with reporters at Majdal Shams, Israeli military spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said that forensics showed the rocket was an Iranian-made Falaq-1. Hezbollah had earlier announced firing a Falaq-1 missile on Saturday, saying it had targeted an Israeli military headquarters. In a televised statement, Hagari also said that for now there was no change in Home Front Command instructions, indicating the army was not expecting imminent escalation across Israel. Netanyahus far-right coalition ally, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, called for tough retaliation, including against Hezbollahs leader, Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah. For the death of children, Nasrallah should pay with his head. All of Lebanon should pay, Smotrich posted on X. The conflict has forced tens of thousands of people in both Lebanon and Israel to leave their homes. Israeli strikes have killed some 350 Hezbollah fighters in Lebanon and more than 100 civilians, including medics, children and journalists. The Israeli military said after Saturdays attack the death toll among civilians killed in Hezbollah attacks had risen to 23 since October, along with at least 17 soldiers. Andrea Tenenti, spokesperson for the UNIFIL peacekeeping force which operates in southern Lebanon, told Reuters its force commander was in contact with authorities in both Lebanon and Israel to understand the details of the Majdal Shams incident and to maintain calm. A senior diplomat focused on Lebanon said all efforts were now needed to avoid an all-out war. ATTACKS FROM LEBANON Hezbollah is the most powerful of a network of Iran-backed groups across the Middle East that have entered the fray in support of their Palestinian ally Hamas since October. Iraqi groups and the Houthis of Yemen have both fired at Israel. Hamas has also carried out rocket attacks on Israel from Lebanon, as has the Lebanese Sunni group, the Jamaa Islamiya. More than 40,000 people live on the Israeli-occupied Golan, more than half of them Druze residents. The Druze are an Arab minority who practice an offshoot of Islam. The attack on the soccer pitch followed an Israeli strike in Lebanon that killed four militants on Saturday. Two security sources in Lebanon said the four fighters killed in the Israeli strike on Kfarkila in southern Lebanon were members of different armed groups, with at least one of them belonging to Hezbollah. The Israeli military said its aircraft had targeted a military structure belonging to Hezbollah, after identifying a militant cell entering the building. At least 30 rockets were then fired from Lebanon across the border, the military said. Hezbollah claimed at least four attacks, including with Katyusha rockets, in retaliation for the Kfarkila attacks. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "date": "July 28, 2024 12:10 pm",
        "content": "Lady Gaga was one of the biggest names to perform during Friday evenings uniquely memorable Olympics Opening Ceremony in Paris. Gaga took to a specially built stage on the bank of the River Seine to give a performance inspired by French Cabaret. She sang Mon Truc en Plume, a well known French circus song. The Poker Face singer was the first musical act of the night, and appeared to experience some sound issues that fans on social media were quick to note were marring her performance once she sat down at her piano to sing. One also took issue with her vocals, calling her accent French-adjacent. Events werent helped when one of her dancers fell off the stage, no doubt wet and slippery after the torrents of rain that fell early in the evening. BBC footage captured the dancer falling backwards and landing on the floor behind a speaker, where he lay flat on his back for a few seconds before recovering and continuing the routine. Gaga took to social media following the performance, writing on X how privileged she had felt to take part: I am humbled to be asked by the Olympics organising committee to sing such a special French song  a song to honour the French people and their tremendous history of art, music, and theatre. We rented pompoms from Le Lido archive  a real French cabaret theatre. We collaborated with Dior to create custom costumes, using naturally molted feathers. I studied French choreography that put a modern twist on a French classic. I rehearsed tirelessly to study a joyful French dance, brushing up on some old skills. I bet you didnt know I used to dance at a 60s French party on the lower east side when I was first starting out! I hope you love this performance as much as I do. The star finished by wishing the athletes taking part all the best and saying, Let the Games begin. Source: Deadline --Agencies",

        "content": "The Consumer Affairs Authority (CAA) has announced that a controlled price will be imposed for bread starting next week, if the vendors fail to sell a 450-gram loaf of bread at a fixed price of Rs 130. Director of the Raids and Special Investigation Department of the CAA Sanjay Irasinghe stated that non-compliance with the fixed price for bread could result in fines ranging from Rs. 100,000 for small shops and Rs. 500,000 to Rs. 5 million for larger companies or bakeries. The consumers frequently complain about the lack of fixed prices and inconsistent weights of bread. In response, the Consumer Affairs Authority has been conducting raids time to time in order to address these issues. On February 02, the CAA issued a gazette notification mandating that the minimum weight of a loaf of bread should be 450 grams, and a half loaf should weigh at least 225 grams. Against this backdrop, the All Ceylon Bakery Owners Association recently announced a reduction in the price of a 450-gram loaf of bread by Rs 10, effective from midnight on Friday (July 26).",

        "date": "July 28, 2024 02:59 pm",
        "content": "The official video of the Paris 2024 opening ceremony appears to have been deleted from the Olympics account as viewers backlash grows - with fans flocking to praise the London 2012 showcase, which remains online. Social media users shared a screenshot of the organisations footage, which showed a blank screen with the caption this video is not available. Meanwhile, the show also does not appear to be on their YouTube channel - despite there being coverage of the games both before and after the ceremony. And full-length versions of the ceremonies for London 2012, Rio 2016, Beijing 2022 and even Nagano 1998 are all available. Neither the Olympics nor the Paris games have given any reason for this apparent omission. Both have been contacted for comment. It comes after the event was dubbed the worst ever and sparked backlash as it was carried out amid appalling weather. Among the various artistic tableaus, named after French values such as freedom, fraternity and equality, it was the last supper-style performance in festivité - or party - scene which caused the most controversy. Complete with models, dancers, fashion icons and drag queens from the host nation, the performance took place on a bridge over the capitals river around a table, which also doubled as a catwalk. At the centre was a woman in front of DJ equipment with a golden halo-style crown, surrounded by several drag queens and dozens of dancers and performers. A fashion show which showcased clothing designed by some of Frances most promising young designers took centre stage, as those seated on either side performed slick choreography. Among those present was Drag Race icon Nicky Doll, who has appeared on the French franchise, RuPauls Drag Race UK vs The World and now hosts Frances own version. Although also hampered by hard-to-hear music, many young people and fans of the popular TV show took to social media to praise the tableau, which aimed to echo the atmosphere of a nightclub and featured dancing and lip-syncing on the soaking-wet stage. But others were less impressed, accusing organisers of creating a woke parody of the Last Supper - a painting by Leonardo da Vinci depicting Jesus last meal with his disciples. The curtain-raiser was also blighted by several gaffes, including issues with country names and the Olympic flag accidentally raised upside down. Tesla and SpaceX owner Elon Musk, who has come under criticism for his conservative beliefs, including towards his own daughter, wrote on X - formerly Twitter - claimed the performance was extremely disrespectful to Christians. He added: Christianity has become toothless. Reacting to the event, Catholic Bishop Robert Barron, from the US, posted a video online and said: I love the Olympics, so I turn on the opening ceremony of the Olympics. And what do I see now? Its in Paris, France, a city I love, I spent three years as a doctoral student there. I see this gross mockery of the last supper and I wont describe it any further. Later in the show, the most bizarre moment of the night saw a giant platter bedecked in fake fruits and other foods - with a smurf resting among them. The man, dressed in a skintight blue bodysuit that left very little to the imagination, was dressed as the Greek God of wine, festivity and theatre, Dionysus, who was later unveiled to be French actor and singer Phillippe Katerine. Today, he laughed off the criticism, telling BFM TV: It wouldnt be fun if there were no controversy. Wouldnt it be boring if everyone agreed on this planet? Viewers reported poor audio caused by the near-torrential rain and even joked online that organisers needed to stop the boats. Fans online were left unimpressed by the unique approach to the opening ceremony, with one writing: Im sorry but this is the worst Olympic opening ceremony in memory. Its an interesting idea bringing the athletes in on boats but it looks rubbish and misses the roar of the crowd. Sorry but not for me. Hundreds of thousands of spectators watched as 6,800 athletes covered in plastic ponchos attempted to keep their spirits high as they travelled down the river Seine in a huge flotilla of 85 boats. Performances from Lady Gaga and approximately 3,000 dancers, acrobats and actors were hard to hear over the sound of rain, with viewers slamming it as the worst Olympic opening ceremony in memory. The show garnered a mixed reception from the UK and foreign press. The New York Times scathingly called it a bloated made-for-TV spectacle, with the New York Post labelling it boring, ill-conceived and choppy. Even within France the reception was muted, with Le Figaro saying the show was great but some of it was just too much. Gaffes with country names, the mounting of the Olympic flag and bizarre scenes which saw as headless Marie Antoinette singing peppered the display last night as sport begins in earnest this morning. At one point, as the long line of boats filled with athletes made its way down the Seine, an embarrassing moment saw South Korea labelled North Korea by the announcers. As the South Korean delegation sailed down the Seine River, they were introduced with the official name for North Korea: Republique populaire democratique de Coree in French, then Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea in English. The IOC said in a post on its official Korean-language X account: We deeply apologise for the mistake that occurred when introducing the South Korean team during the broadcast of the opening ceremony. The Paris Olympics have been contacted for comment. Source: Daily Mali --Agencies",

        "content": "Compared to the past two years, 2024 is expected to see a significant rise in the number of local and foreign tourists visiting attractions managed by the Department of Forest Conservation, said Pavithra Wanniarachchi, the Minister of Wildlife, Forest Resources Conservation, and Irrigation. She noted that 364,521 tourists visited in the first half of 2024, with 40 of them being tourists. Addressing a press briefing held under the press briefing series titled Two Years of Progress and Way Forward, held at the Presidential Media Centre today (28), Wildlife, Forest Resources Conservation, and Irrigation Minister Pavithra Wanniarachchi further elaborated; Compared to the past two years, 2024 is expected to see a significant increase in the number of local and foreign tourists visiting attractive destinations managed by the Department of Forest Conservation. In 2022, 289,405 tourists visited these destinations, and in 2023, the number rose to 444,053. In the first six months of 2024 alone, 364,521 tourists have already visited. Among these visitors, 19.8 were foreign tourists in 2022. This percentage increased to 27.8 in 2023 and has reached 40 so far in 2024. To strengthen the economy by earning foreign exchange, we have prepared regulations to uplift the eco-tourism industry, obtained Parliaments approval, and made the necessary legal amendments. In 2023, the 2,500-hectare Gal Oya national park was opened to the public as a new tourist destination. Additionally, an information Centre was established at the entrance gate of the Kudava Dorana ela in Sinharaja Forest, drawing more visitors. In 2024, the Manigala Forest Lodge was built in the Ilukkumbura area of the Knuckles forest reserve, and a bicycle path was opened in Udawattakele, Kandy, for tourists. This year also saw the opening of the Bandarawela Falls Lodge and Galwila Ecological Park in the Puttalam district. To address the sanitary issues faced by foreign tourists, dedicated sanitary facilities have been established exclusively for foreign passport holders at popular tourist destinations such as Sinharaja, Kanneliya, Hurulu, Knuckles, and Udawattakele. Additionally, an online ticket reservation system named Day Visitor E-Permits is now available for Yala, Udawalawe, Horton Plains, Kaudulla, Minneriya, and Wilpattu National Parks. Efforts are also underway to increase the forest cover from the current 29 to 32 by 2030. This involves acquiring approximately 144,000 hectares of new forest land that was not previously gazetted under our management. To encourage people to plant trees outside of forests, the Cabinet has approved the preparation of the related act, which has been submitted to the Legal Draftsman Department, and the draft is now complete. This year, modern technology, including the use of drones, has been employed to protect forests. Additionally, joint efforts are underway to safeguard non-reserved forests in the North Eastern and North Central Provinces. Forest boundaries are being identified and declared as protected, with boundary canals planted around them to establish a permanent forest system. We have placed special emphasis on the restoration of mangrove ecosystems, and our efforts have received international recognition. Over the past two years, we have planted 326 hectares of mangroves, and this year, Sri Lanka was honoured with the United Nations Flagship Award for our contributions to mangrove restoration during the United Nations Decade on Ecosystem Restoration. The Department of National Zoological Gardens under our ministry was also adversely affected by the countrys economic crisis. Although revenue was low during those years, we earned Rs.1, 089.97 million in 2023. By the end of June 2023, revenue reached Rs.436.71 million, and by the end of June 2024, it had increased to Rs.728.60 million, representing a 66 growth compared to the previous year. The State Timber Corporation is expected to record a net profit by the end of the year, thanks to the revenue of Rs.2, 000 million achieved so far in 2024. Additionally, the measures taken to control the elephant menacea significant issue in our countryshould help reduce human and wild elephant deaths starting from 2023. To support this effort, over 4,700 workers have been hired to maintain the existing 5,390 km of electric fencing. We also plan to conduct a survey on the countrys elephant population for the first time in 13 years within the next two months. Moreover, the Fauna and Flora Protection Ordinance have been amended, and new laws have been introduced to combat wildlife crimes more effectively. Secretary to the Ministry of Wildlife, Forest Resources Conservation and Irrigation Gunadasa Samarasinghe, Director General of Wildlife M.G.C. Sooriyabandara, Conservator General of Forests E.A.P.N.

        "date": "July 29, 2024 10:03 am",
        "content": "Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro has won a third term with 51 of the vote, the countrys electoral authority said just after midnight on Monday, with 80 of ballot boxes counted. The result announced by the authority came despite multiple exit polls which pointed to an opposition win. The authority said opposition candidate Edmundo Gonzalez won 44 of the vote, though the opposition had earlier said it had reasons to celebrate and asked supporters to continue monitoring vote counts. The results cannot be hidden. The country has peacefully chosen a change, Gonzalez said in a post on X at around 11 p.m. local time, before the results were announced. Opposition leader Maria Corina Machado reiterated a call for the countrys military to uphold the results of the vote. A message for the military. The people of Venezuela have spoken: they dont want Maduro, she said earlier on X. It is time to put yourselves on the right side of history. You have a chance and its now. Venezuelas military has always supported Maduro, a 61-year-old former bus driver and foreign minister, and there have been no public signs that leaders of the armed forces are breaking from the government.

        "date": "July 29, 2024 11:22 am",
        "content": "The applications to cast postal votes must be handed over to District Returning Officers on or before August 05, the Election Commission announced. Accordingly, all applications of the postal voting applicants must be forwarded to the relevant District Returning Officers through the District Election Office address. The commission announced that the application forms to be completed for availing the postal voting facility can be obtained free of charge from the places where the voters lists are displayed, from the district election offices and also from the website of the Election Commission. Furthermore, the Election Commission informs the general public that the applications must be received by the respective District Election Offices before 12.00 midnight on August 05, which is the last day of applications receipt and mere delivery of applications by post on that day is not a reason for acceptance of applications. The applications received after the deadline will be rejected without consideration, as per the Election Commission. The Election regulatory body further mentioned that the 2024 voters list must be displayed at the relevant government offices for the ease of the postal voters. Thus, all certified voters lists related to all the electoral districts will be displayed at the following locations during usual office hours from July 26, 2024. - All District Secretariats Kachcheris - All Divisional Secretariats - All Grama Niladhari Offices",

        "date": "July 29, 2024 11:26 am",
        "content": "Apples upcoming artificial intelligence features will arrive later than anticipated and will miss the initial launch of upcoming iPhone and iPad software overhauls, Bloomberg News reported on Sunday. The iPhone maker is planning to begin rolling out Apple Intelligence to customers as part of software updates coming by October, the report added, citing people familiar with the matter. AI features will arrive a few weeks after the initial iOS 18 and iPadOS 18 releases planned for September, Bloomberg said. Apple is planning to make Apple Intelligence available to software developers for the first time for early testing as soon as this week via iOS 18.1 and iPadOS 18.1 betas, the report added. Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment outside regular business hours. In June, Apple underscored its AI push with a slew of new features and software enhancements for its iPhone and other devices to bolster sagging sales. Apple Intelligence, which uses AI to conjure text, images and other content on command, would be available on iPhone 15 Pro, iPhone 15 Pro Max, and iPad and Mac with its M1 chip and later versions. iPhone Mirroring on MacOS Sequoia allows the phones screen to be viewed and interacted with on Mac computers. The report comes after Apple in late June delayed launching three new artificial intelligence features because landmark European Union tech rules require it to ensure that rival products and services can function with its device.
