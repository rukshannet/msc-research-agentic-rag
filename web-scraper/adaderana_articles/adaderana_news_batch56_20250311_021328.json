The Civil Security Department (CSD) has commenced an internal disciplinary investigation on this incident, however, Acting Minister of Defence has ordered relevant authorities to conduct an internal investigation in this regard. Accordingly, disciplinary action will be taken against the CSD personnel for misconduct if he was found to have committed any disciplinary offense while on duty, the Ministry of Defence said in a statement. It was reported that following the procession, the female elephant had been tied to a tree on the banks of the Mahaweli River, where the officer in question had shot Sita after mistaking it for a wild elephant that had crossed the river, at around 3.30 a.m. last morning. The mahout, who said he was having breakfast when the incident happened, accused the officer of shooting the elephant despite people telling him that Sita was not a wild elephant. The injured 48-year-old elephant was later treated by veterinary surgeons of the Wildlife Conservation Department. In a statement, the Director General of the Wildlife Conservation Department, M.G.C. Sooriyabandara had clarified that one of the wildlife officers at the site had mistakenly fired rubber bullets at the female elephant Sita while trying to scare off the wild elephants in the vicinity.

In response to the request, a team of Wildlife Department officers along with one Civil Security Department (CSD) personnel had been entrusted to drive away the wild elephants.",

        "date": "October 2, 2023 08:13 am",
        "content": "(Reuters) - At least 13 people have been killed in a fire in a nightclub in Murcia in southeast Spain, emergency services said on Sunday, adding that rescuers were still searching for people unaccounted for after the blaze. Outside the club, young people hugged, looking shocked as they waited for information after the fire that broke out in the early hours in Atalayas, on the outskirts of the city. I think we left 30 seconds to 1 minute before the alarms went off and all the lights went out (and) the screams saying there was a fire, one survivor, who was not identified, said. Five family members and two friends are missing. Spanish media reported that several of the dead were from one group that was celebrating a birthday. Diego Seral, of Spains National Police, told reporters the dead were found in the Fonda Milagros nightclub, one of three adjoining clubs, which had sustained the majority of fire damage, including the collapse of its roof, he added. The collapse was making it difficult to locate victims, and it was difficult to pinpoint yet where exactly the fire started, he said. Police investigators have not yet been able to access the site due to the high temperatures and danger of collapse. The identification of the bodies would take time, Seral said. The emergency services gave the death toll, which has risen steadily throughout the day, as 13. The cause of the blaze is being investigated. Earlier, Murcias Mayor Jose Ballesta told reporters seven bodies had been found in the same area of the first floor, where the fire broke out. A spokesperson for the Teatre nightclub, Maria Dolores Albellan, told reporters the fire originated in the neighbouring club, Fonda Milagros, before spreading to the two adjoining clubs. Ballesta declared three days of mourning for those who had died. Flags were lowered to half mast outside Murcias City Hall. Footage released by Murcias fire service showed firefighters working to control flames inside the nightclub. The fire had destroyed part of the roof, the footage showed. We are devastated, Ballesta said on Spanish TV channel 24h, adding rescuers were still searching for several people reported missing. Ballesta told 24h the fire started at around 6 a.m and had now been brought under control. Four people have been treated in hospital for smoke inhalation. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

The CEB recently made a request from the PUCSL to increase electricity tariffs once again, citing the need to cover the costs for thermal power generation during the months when arid weather conditions were prevalent across the country. According to CEB sources, the detailed facts in relation to the tariff hike request will be submitted to the PUCSL within the next two days since it is a request to increase the tariffs beyond the usual tariff revision procedure. CEB General Manager Eng. Dr. Narendra De Silva said they have sought an electricity tariff hike in October, which was supposed to be made in January. However, Samagi Jana Balavegaya (SJB) Parliamentarian Tissa Attanayake stressed that the PUCSL has no rights to permit an electricity tariff hike again. Meanwhile, Minister Manusha Nanayakkara states that the institutions like CEB are needed to be restricted and made profitable, without inconveniencing the public. At the meantime, the Publicity Secretary to the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) Vijitha Herath mentioned that it if the electricity tariff is revised again, it is inevitable that the people will be in dire straits. However, Saman Rathnapriya, the Director General of Trade Unions to the President expressed that the government will take measures to revise the electricity tariffs in a manner that does not inconvenience the people.",

        "date": "October 2, 2023 10:48 am",
        "content": "At least 10 Cuban migrants died and 17 others were seriously injured after a freight truck they were riding in crashed on a highway in southern Mexico near the border with Guatemala. The National Immigration Institute said all of the dead Cuban migrants were women, and one of them was under 18. The Institute said the driver of the vehicle had apparently been speeding and lost control of the truck, which was carrying 27 migrants at the time. The driver fled the scene. The Chiapas state civil defense office said the crash happened Sunday on a highway near the town of Pijijiapan. Photos showed a truck with an open cargo box tipped on its side, and the victims on the side of the highway. An employee of the state prosecutors office said the migrants had been hitching rides on passing vehicles. Mexican authorities generally prohibit migrants without proper documents from riding buses, so those without the money to hire smugglers often walk along the side of highways, hitching rides aboard passing trucks. It was the latest in a series of migrants deaths in Mexico amid a surge in migrants traveling toward the U.S. border. A migrant from Ecuador died and 10 others from Colombia and Guatemala were injured in an crash Saturday that occurred while they were being taken for processing in a van operated by Mexicos immigration agency. Mexicos National Migration Institute said the van was involved in a collision with a bus in the the city of Mexicali, across the border from Calexico, California. On Friday, two Mexican migrants were fatally shot on the Mexican side of the border and three others suffered gunshot wounds, the Migration Institute said. Rescue services found a group of 14 Mexican nationals at dawn on Cuchuma Hill near Tecate, a city between Mexicali and Tijuana. The cause of the shooting wasnt known, but migrant crossings often involve agreements with local cartels for right of passage. Migrants are sometimes shot if their smuggler is working for a rival gang or if they havent paid passage rights. Migrants are also often robbed by roving gangs of thieves and kidnappers in border areas. And on Thursday in Chiapas, a truck flipped over on the highway, killing two Central American migrants and injuring another 27. The Migration Institute said Friday that 52 migrants were traveling in an overcrowded dump truck when the driver lost control and overturned. The injured, including six children, were transported to hospital, where they were all granted legal cards of asylum, as victims of a crime on Mexican territory. And on Wednesday, two Central American migrants died after trying to board a moving train in the state of Coahuila near the Texas border. Source - The Associated Press --Agencies",

Called ARCHAX after the avian dinosaur archaeopteryx, the robot has cockpit monitors that receive images from cameras hooked up to the exterior so that the pilot can manoeuvre the arms and hands with joysticks from inside its torso. The 3.5-ton robot, which will be unveiled at the Japan Mobility Show later this month, has two modes: the upright robot mode and a vehicle mode in which it can travel up to 10 km (6 miles) per hour. Japan is very good at animation, games, robots and automobiles so I thought it would be great if I could create a product that compressed all these elements into one, said Ryo Yoshida, the 25-year-old chief executive of Tsubame Industries. I wanted to create something that says, This is Japan. Yoshida plans to build and sell five of the machines for the well-heeled robot fan, but hopes the robot could one day be used for disaster relief or in the space industry. Yoshida became interested in manufacturing at an early age, learning how to weld at his grandfathers ironworks and then going on to found a company that produces myoelectric prosthetic hands. He said he is eager to keep Japans competitive edge in manufacturing alive. I hope to learn from previous generations and carry on the tradition, he said. Source  Reuters --Agencies",

        "date": "October 2, 2023 03:52 pm",
        "content": "(Reuters) - Scientists Katalin Kariko and Drew Weissman from Hungary and the United States respectively won the 2023 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for discoveries enabling the development of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, the award-giving body said on Monday. The prize, among the most prestigious in the scientific world, is selected by the Nobel Assembly of Swedens Karolinska Institute medical university and also comes with 11 million Swedish crowns (about 1 million). The 2023 NobelPrize in Physiology or Medicine has been awarded to Katalin Karikó and Drew Weissman for their discoveries concerning nucleoside base modifications that enabled the development of effective mRNA vaccines against COVID-19, the body said. Kariko was senior vice president and head of RNA protein replacement at BioNTech until 2022 and has since acted as an adviser to the company. She is also a professor at the University of Szeged in Hungary and adjunct professor at the University of Pennsylvanias Perelman School of Medicine. Weissman is professor in vaccine research at the Perelman School. Kariko found a way to prevent the immune system from launching an inflammatory reaction against lab-made mRNA, previously seen as a major hurdle against any therapeutic use of mRNA. Together with Weissman, she showed in 2005 that adjustments to nucleosides, the molecular letters that write the mRNAs genetic code, can keep the mRNA under the immune systems radar. So this years Nobel Prize recognizes their basic science discovery that fundamentally changed our understanding of how mRNA interacts with the immune system and had a major impact on society during the recent pandemic, said Rickard Sandberg, member of the Nobel Assembly at Karolinska Institute The medicine prize kicks off this years awards with the remaining five to be unveiled in the coming days. The prizes, first handed out in 1901, were created by Swedish dynamite inventor and wealthy businessman Alfred Nobel, and are awarded for achievements in science, literature and peace, and in later years also for economics. The Swedish king will present the prizes at a ceremony in Stockholm on Dec. 10, the anniversary of Nobels death, followed by a lavish banquet at city hall. Last years medicine prize went to Swede Svante Paabo for sequencing the genome of the Neanderthal, an extinct relative of present-day humans, and for discovering a previously unknown human relative, the Denisovans. Other past winners include Alexander Fleming, who shared the 1945 prize for the discovery of penicillin, and Karl Landsteiner in 1930 for his discovery of human blood groups.

During the discussion, the representatives of the engineers trade unions stated that the recent flight delays were caused by the technical failures in several aircraft, however, the authorities of Sri Lankan Airlines have claimed that this situation arose as a result of certain trade union actions. Following inquiries by the officials and trade union representatives, the Aviation Minister expressed that there are about 260 pilots for the 21 aircraft currently in operation with the airline and that accordingly, 12 pilots can be assigned per aircraft in rotation, and that this is in line with international standards. Furthermore, Minister de Silva, who highlighted that a flight officer must fly 100 hours per month according to international regulations, pointed out that in general, a SriLankan Airlines pilot has flown only around 60 hours per month as per the available data. He also claimed that if one pilot of the airline flew at least 80 hours per month, such an issue would not have arisen. Moreover, the minister also drew attention to the fact that there is an issue within the trade unions regarding their salaries and allowances. However, the Aviation Minister claimed that SriLankan Airlines Ltd. has to pay back loans amounting to a total of USD 1.2 billion as well as their interest. Meanwhile, the losses incurred during the recent few days due to the delays in nearly 08 flights were USD 06 million, the minister said, emphasizing that it was therefore neither possible to make any allowance nor any salary increment for the employees at the time. The minister, however stressed to the trade union representatives that nevertheless, if the productivity of the airline is increased, certain payments can be made based on their productivity. Nimal Siripala de Silva, who claimed that he holds a great responsibility to provide high-quality service to air passengers as the aviation minister, asserted that accordingly, he decided to hand over the right to operate these flights for other airlines while protecting the rights of SriLankan Airlines. Accordingly, the other airlines should be provided with the Fifth Freedom Right right or privilege granted by one State to another State to put down and to take on, in the territory of the first State, traffic coming from or destined for a third State in international air services, the minister said. The Secretary of the Ministry of Ports and Aviation K.D.S. Ruwanchandra, Chairman of SriLankan Airlines Asoka Pathirage, Chairman of the Civil Aviation Authority G.S. Vithanage, its Director General G.K. Jayakantha and other officials took part in this discussion.",

        "content": "The Asia Internet Coalition (AIC) has voiced concern that the Sri Lanka Government is moving the proposed Online Safety Bill without undertaking any stakeholder consultation. The Bill provides for a draconian system to stifle dissent and Sri Lankans rights to expression, said Jeff Paine, Managing Director of Asia Internet Coalition, in a statement. He stated that legislation should not dampen innovation by restricting public debate and the exchange of ideas while strongly urging the Sri Lankan government to work closely with industry stakeholders to develop regulations that are reasonable and consistent with international best practices.

        "content": "Minister of State for Technology Kanaka Herath announced that Sri Lanka will introduce the new motor vehicle revenue license system (eRL 2.0) on October 07. He emphasized that this program will be implemented in all provinces except for the Western Province, the Presidents Media Division (PMD) reported. Additionally, he highlighted that the new motor vehicle revenue licenses (eRL 2.0) can be conveniently obtained from home using this innovative system. State Minister Herath shared these details during a news conference held at the Presidential Media Centre today (02), under the theme Collective path to a stable country. State Minister Kanaka Herath who spoke further said: To improve the efficiency of the public service in this country, as well as to reduce irregularities, the entire public service should be digitized. Therefore, President Ranil Wickremesinghe stated that all government institutions in Sri Lanka should be digitized through the 2023 budget statement. Nine pilot projects are being implemented by selecting nine government institutions including Divisional Secretariat Divisions, Pradeshiya Sabha, Municipal Councils and District Secretariat Offices, under the digitization of the public service. In addition to this, starting from the 7th of this month with the introduction of eRL 2.0, an opportunity arises to acquire vehicle revenue licenses through the online system, a program jointly executed by the State Ministry of Technology and the Information and Communication Technology Association of Sri Lanka. This initiative encompasses all eight provinces, excluding the Western Province. Concurrently, there are ongoing efforts to expand this program to encompass all government institutions and facilitate online payments by March of the coming year. These endeavours are geared toward enhancing the efficiency and fortifying the public service throughout the entire country through digitization, with the Digicon 2023-2030 program having been initiated under the guidance of President Ranil Wickremesinghe to attain this objective. Furthermore, a series of events, including technology exhibitions, conferences, and commendation ceremonies for young individuals, have been organized. Of particular note, the Digital Investment Conference aimed at kick-starting new businesses in the country is scheduled for October 13 at the Shangri-La Hotel in Colombo, with approximately 100 investors slated to participate. This event is poised to bolster the nations investments and aligns with the core objective of the Digicon program, which is to establish a comprehensive digital economy plan for the country. It is anticipated that this endeavour will enable the rapid accumulation of foreign exchange, thereby contributing to the overall strengthening of the countrys economy.",

        "date": "October 2, 2023 10:01 pm",
        "content": "The World Health Organization (WHO) recommended on Monday the use of a second malaria vaccine to curb the life-threatening disease spread to humans by some mosquitoes. Almost exactly two years ago, W.H.O. recommended the broad use of the worlds first malaria vaccine called RTS,S, WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told a briefing in Geneva. Today, it gives me great pleasure to announce that WHO is recommending a second vaccine called R21Matrix-M to prevent malaria in children at risk of the disease. R21Matrix-M, developed by Britains University of Oxford, will become available to countries by mid-2024, Tedros said, adding that doses would cost between 2 and 4. WHO is now reviewing the vaccine for prequalification, which is WHO stamp of approval, and will enable GAVI (a global vaccine alliance) and UNICEF to buy the vaccine from manufacturers, Tedros said. 20 MILLION DOSES R21Matrix-M is mass manufactured by Serum Institute of India and uses Novavaxs Matrix M adjuvant. Adar Poonawalla, CEO of Serum Institute of India, said it had already produced more than 20 million doses in anticipation of WHOs recommendation. We will ramp it up as per what the demand requirements are, he told Reuters. We hope that by the end of 2024, there will be zero mismatch of demand and supply, with our supply coming into the system. The vaccine will compete against the RTS,S shot by GSK plc (GSK.L), which was recommended by the United Nations-agency in 2021 and sold under the brand Mosquirix. The WHO said both vaccines had shown similar efficacy in separate trials, but as there had been no head-to-head trial there was no evidence showing whether one performed better. The agency has left it to countries to decide which product they will use based on various factors, including the affordability and supply. GSK has always recognised the need for a second malaria vaccine, but it is increasingly evident that RTS,S, the first ever malaria vaccine and the first ever vaccine against a human parasite, set a strong benchmark, GSK said in a statement. The company added that over 1.7 million children in Ghana, Kenya and Malawi had received at least one dose of the shot and it would be rolled our in a further nine malaria endemic countries from early next year. DENGUE VACCINE Tedros added the agency had also recommended Takeda Pharmaceuticals vaccine against dengue called Qdenga for children aged six to 16 years living in areas where the infection is a significant public health problem. Dengue, common in tropical and subtropical climates, is a viral infection spread from mosquitoes to people. Takedas vaccine was shown in trials to be effective against all 4 stereotypes of the virus in people who were previously infected by dengue, Hanna Nohynek, chair of WHOs Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization, told journalists. She added, however, that there remained uncertainty about its performance against stereotype 3 and 4 in people who have not been infected previously. The WHOs strategic advisory group also recommended a simplified single dose regime for primary immunization for most COVID-19 vaccines to improve acceptance of the shots at a time when most people have had at least one prior infection The agency added that any monovalent or bivalent vaccine could be used given that monovalent vaccines that target the XBB.1.5 variant - the dominant variant in many places this year - are not available in many countries.

The session will commence at 9:30 a.m. However, the proposed Anti-Terrorism Bill would not be tabled in the parliament today, Minister of Justice, Prisons Affairs and Constitutional Reforms Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe said speaking on the matter. From 10:30 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., Civil Procedure Code (Amendment) Bill (Second Reading), Elections (Special Provisions) Bill (Second Reading), Regulations under the Mediation (Special Categories of Disputes) Act and Order under the Judicature Act have been scheduled to be taken up for debate. Subsequently, from 5:00 p.m. to 5:30 p.m., the Motion at the Adjournment Time by the government will be taken up for debate.

        "content": "(Bloomberg)  The US government said a bondholders lawsuit against Sri Lanka over the countrys historic debt default should be put on hold. In a statement of interest filed Monday in New York federal court, the US backed the Sri Lankan governments request to delay a lawsuit by Hamilton Reserve Bank Ltd. seeking full payment and accrued interest on more than 250 million in bonds that came due in July 2022. The US said the delay would help with ongoing restructuring talks between the South Asian country and other creditors. Sri Lanka fell into default in May 2022 after the expiration of a 30-day grace period for missed interest payments on two of its sovereign bonds, the first debt default by the country since it gained independence from Britain in 1948. Hamilton Bank sued Sri Lanka in July 2022 Sri Lanka in July asked US District Judge Denise Cote to put the case on hold for six months. Cote had put her decision on hold until the US decided whether or not to file a statement of interest. The French and UK governments previously asked the court to put the suit on hold. The two countries said in a Sept. 6 letter that they were writing as members of the Paris Club, an informal group of official creditors that help coordinate repayments for struggling debtor nations. They said delaying the case was key to ensuring the success of the International Monetary Fund supported assistance program for the nation. Sri Lanka recently announced the completion of its local debt restructuring plan and is now engaging with other holders of Sri Lankas foreign debt, including China and India. Hamilton Reserve has opposed the bid to postpone the proceedings, saying that putting them on hold would be both contrary to US policy interests and an exercise in futility. The case is Hamilton Reserve Bank v. Sri Lanka, 22-cv-5199, US District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). -Agencies",

        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe, during an interview with an international broadcaster based in Germany, slammed the allegations levelled in the documentary aired by British television network Channel 4 with regard to the 2019 Easter Sunday bombings. Wickremesinghe stressed that the Sri Lankan government would not carry out an international inquiry on any issue, including the Easter Sunday terror attacks. On September 06, Channel 4 aired a controversial documentary containing startling accusations relating to the bombings on Easter Sunday 2019 which targeted several Catholic churches and luxury hotels in Sri Lanka. The carnage claimed the lives of more than 260 people and left hundreds of others wounded. Channel 4s latest Dispatches investigation titled Sri Lankas Easter Bombings is a nearly 50-minute-long video with serious, yet straightforward allegations about the attacks. It was based on the testimonies of high-placed whistleblowers who alleged that senior governmental officials were complicit in this heinous act. Speaking to Martin Gak from the German state-owned international broadcaster Deutsche Welle during his Berlin visit, the Sri Lankan leader said a few people may have asked for an international probe, but the parliament has not. Further, referring to an FBI report, Wickremesinghe said No one outside was involved in the attack. Clearly peeved when inquired about Channel 4s allegations in its documentary, Wickremesinghe accused the host of putting the British television network on a pedestal and treating its report as the gospel truth. Wickremesinghe said he has appointed a committee comprising a judge, a well-known former air force commander and a renowned lawyer to look into these accusations. When the host cast doubt about this committee having teeth enough to do anything and inquired about the Sri Lankan Catholic Church seeking for an independent investigation into the carnage, the Sri Lankan president lashed out at him saying, You have no right to ask me this question. Interrupting the questions multiple times and losing his cool, Wickremesinghe went on to accuse the host of trying to corner him and denigrating the incumbent government for not doing anything.",

The HRCSL on Monday (Oct. 02), sent a letter to the Public Security Minister with preliminary observations and recommendations on the Bill, suggesting that the legislation should avoid criminalizing statements deemed merely distressing to persons, as feelings of distress can vary in degrees and can be highly subjective. In its letter, the rights organization also noted that the proposed Online Safety Commission should be formed through an appointment mechanism that guarantees its political independence. This Commission should not be vested with quasi-judicial powers, not with powers to designate online locations as declared online locations. The HRCSL further pointed out that clear criteria for the classification of inauthentic online accounts should be included in the Bill in a manner that preserves the freedom of online users to remain anonymous and to engage in parody or satire.

In response to a question raised by a Member of the Parliament during the parliamentary session today (Oct. 03), Minister Thondaman further emphasized that the NWSDB experiences a short-staffed situation in many areas and an over-staffed situation in some. When I took over the water ministry, I had to deal with an unusually high number of political appointments, and today the water ministry stands close to 70 of the labor force being unskilled. We have short-staffed in many areas and over-staffed in some. The Water Supply Minister made these remarks while replying to a question regarding whether the ministry has any capacity to recruit the labourers hired through contractors for NWSDBs pipe installations so as to make the work more efficient while safeguarding their jobs, as these labourers are now facing severe issues pertaining to their wages. In response, Minister Thondaman also pointed out that it is not possible to give permanent appointments against this backdrop, citing the current expenditures of the ministry. So that is the case. We have tried to do our restructuring but at the same time we cannot give permanent appointments. Before this water tariff hike that has taken place recently, it was the first time in 10 years when a water tariff hike came in, he said, adding that with the electricity increase of 66 initially, we have to pay close to Rs. 425 million a month. Apart from that with our loan component, Rs. 2.8 billion was going out every month, the minister emphasized. Furthermore, the Water Supply Minister stated that basically, it is not sustainable for the ministry to recruit permanent workers, highlighting what the ministry is trying to do is to enhance the skills of existing unskilled workers.",

        "content": "Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa has warned that Sri Lanka will have to face grave consequences as a result of the enforcement of the Online Safety Bill. Joining the parliamentary debate on the matter this morning (03 Oct.), Premadasa explained that as of now, several social media and tech giants including Facebook and Google have extensively opposed the relevant Bill. Speaking on the recent concerns voiced by the Asia Internet Coalition (AIC) in this regard, Premadasa questioned how Sri Lanka will promote foreign investments in the event it upsets such large-scale companies. Deeming the matter a dictatorial process, the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) Leader urged that both, the Online Security Bill and the Anti-Terrorism Bill be withdrawn. On 02 October, the AIC voiced concern that the Sri Lanka Government is moving the proposed Online Safety Bill without undertaking any stakeholder consultation. The Bill provides for a draconian system to stifle dissent and Sri Lankans rights to expression, said Jeff Paine, Managing Director of Asia Internet Coalition, in a statement. He stated that legislation should not dampen innovation by restricting public debate and the exchange of ideas while strongly urging the Sri Lankan government to work closely with industry stakeholders to develop regulations that are reasonable and consistent with international best practices. The AIC is an industry association comprising leading Internet and technology companies, which seeks to promote the understanding and resolution of Internet policy issues in the Asia Pacific region. Co-founded by eBay, Google, Nokia, Skype, and Yahoo! in 2010, the trade association lobbies government agencies to address public policy issues and facilitate the development of the internet economy in the Asia Pacific region. The AICs current membership includes Apple, Facebook, Google, Expedia Group, Amazon, Line, LinkedIn, Rakuten, SAP, Airbnb, Grab, Twitter, Yahoo, Booking.com, and Cloudfare.",

The petitioner further claimed that provisions of the Online Safety Bill violated certain fundamental human rights, including the right to freedom of speech and expression. Thus, Uduwaragedara filed the petition seeking a court order that in order for the Bill to be passed, it must be done with a two-thirds majority in parliament, and a referendum. The much-debated Online Safety Bill was tabled in parliament this morning by Minister of Security Tiran Alles, despite being under fire for some of its problematic aspects. The Bill, published in the government gazette on 18 September, aims to prohibit online communication of certain statements within the country, prevent the use of online accounts  both authentic and inauthentic  for the use of prohibited purposes, to make provisions to identify and declare online locations used for prohibited purposes, to suppress the financing and other support of communication of false statements and for other matters connected therewith.",

        "date": "October 3, 2023 03:38 pm",
        "content": "The World Bank revised up its forecasts for Sri Lankas economy on Tuesday, noting the crisis-hit nation had made strides in reducing inflation and had benefited from tourism revenue as well as an appreciation in its currency. The bank now expects the economy to expand 1.7 in 2024, up from an earlier forecast of 1. It also said the economy is likely to shrink 3.8 this year, less than its earlier prediction of a 4.2 contraction. In the last six months, Sri Lanka has seen runaway inflation drop to 1.3 in September, its currency appreciate by about 12 and foreign exchange reserves improve. It has also benefited from an increase in remittances. But the World Bank also noted Sri Lankas outlook was still clouded by significant uncertainty and there were downside risks. Growth prospects will depend on progress with debt restructuring as well as continued implementation of growth enhancing structural reforms, Richard Walker, a World Bank senior economist told a media briefing. We see further monetary loosening and potential exchange rate pressures, which could counter this downward inflationary trend, he added. Sri Lanka struck an agreement for a 2.9 billion bailout package from the International Monetary Fund in March but a potential shortfall in government revenue has meant that a second tranche of funds from the package may be delayed. In contrast to the World Bank, Sri Lankas central bank has predicted a milder 2 contraction this year and growth of 3.3 in 2024. The economy shrunk 7.8 in 2022. For South Asia as a whole, the global lender predicts growth of 5.8, led by India which is seen expanding 6.3 in fiscal 202324. But it added that regional growth was still slower than its pre-pandemic pace. While South Asia is making steady progress, most countries in the region are not growing fast enough to reach high-income thresholds within a generation, Martin Raiser, World Bank Vice President for South Asia said in a statement.

Electrons move so quickly that their movements were previously thought impossible to follow. But the three physicists have demonstrated a way to create extremely short pulses of light that can be used to measure the rapid processes in which electrons move or change energy, the committee said. It praised the laureates for giving humanity new tools for exploring the world of electrons inside atoms and molecules. The movements of electrons inside atoms and molecules are so rapid that they are measured in attoseconds  an almost incomprehensibly short unit of time. An attosecond is to one second as one second is to the age of the universe, the committee explained. They were able to, in a sense, provide an illumination tool that allows us to watch the assembly of molecules: how things come together to make a molecule, Bob Rosner, president of the American Physical Society and a professor at the University of Chicago, told CNN. These movements happen so quickly that normally we have no idea how they actually occur or what the sequence of events is, said Rosner. But the laureates work means scientists can now observe how these movements happen, he added. Imagine building a house. You have foundation, walls, roof and so on. Theres a sequence to anything complicated. For a molecule, if you dont get the sequence right, you wont be able to assemble it, said Rosner. Source  CNN --Agencies",

        "date": "October 3, 2023 06:32 pm",
        "content": "Countries going through a sovereign default need a debt rework mechanism that grants timely relief, even if that means finding a solution outside the G20s programme, an executive at Lazards sovereign advisory team said. As adviser to the governments of Ghana, Zambia and Sri Lanka, Lazard plays a key role in a number of critical debt restructurings at a time when emerging markets more widely face renewed pressure from growing debt burdens and rising global borrowing costs. The G20 Common Framework - a mechanism designed to provide a swift and comprehensive debt overhaul to poor nations buckling under debt burdens after the COVID-19 shock - was launched by the G20 in late 2020. Zambia, Ghana and Ethiopia are currently reworking their debt under the programme, which has been widely criticised for slow progress that has left countries in limbo. Meanwhile Sri Lanka, too wealthy to qualify for the framework, has seen comparatively swifter progress so far in its debt overhaul. If the choice is between three years in the Common Framework process or a year and a half in an ad-hoc process, I would much prefer the ad-hoc process, Pierre Cailleteau, a managing director at Lazard, told Reuters in an interview. Clearly what matters for our government clients is to have in place a mechanism that really helps them strike a deal and move on, he said. Analysts have blamed in part the increase in the number of different creditors that debt-distressed countries now need to negotiate with, from Chinese policy and commercial banks, to international and in some cases local bondholders. But countries signing up to the programme might have also overestimated the degree to which creditors and other parties in the process were aligned, said Cailleteau. The Common Framework was originally presented as if there was a full agreement behind it and a complete understanding of what it entailed. That I dont think is true, he said. From the beginning there were different interpretations, different degrees of commitment, different understanding of the rules that should apply. A number of efforts have been made to streamline and quicken debt restructuring proceedings. The Global Sovereign Debt Roundtable was launched late last year and held meetings in February, April and September. Another meeting of the roundtable - which brings together official and private creditors as well as governments and international lenders such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) - is scheduled for the World Bank IMF annual meeting in Morocco which kicks off next week. While the Common Framework might eventually evolve to become that smooth and swift mechanism, in the interim a pragmatic but principled solution would have to be found to bring countries debt back to sustainable levels as prescribed by the IMF, Cailleteau said. Thats ok, even if its not under the aegis of the Common Framework. Source  Reuters --Agencies",

In a media release issued on the matter, the NMRA chairman Prof. S. D. Jayaratne said forged documents were found to have been submitted for Customs clearance when importing the drug which later failed the quality tests. The product, manufactured by Livealth Biopharma Pvt Ltd. India, was imported by Isolez Biotech Pharma AG (Pvt) Ltd. The NMRA said the situation came to light following reports of allergic reactions after the drug was administered to several patients under treatment at the Colombo National Hospital and the Matale District Hospital on August 22 and September 16, respectively. While doubts were cast about the quality of the drug, the NMRA had received several reports that sounded the alarm. It was uncovered that the relevant vials containing human immunoglobulin, an antibody produced by blood plasma cells, had not been registered with the NMRA prior to being imported. Additionally, it was observed that not only the due procedure had not been followed when the batch of vials was brought into the country, but the Waiver of Registration (WOR) was also not obtained. The NMRA has found that the document submitted as the WOR had been forged using NMRA letterhead and the signature of a senior official. Accordingly, the use of the controversial batch of human immunoglobulin has temporarily been halted as investigations are on. The NMRA said it also filed a complaint before the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) today. When contacted by the NMRA, the India-based manufacturer has said it does not produce this drug anymore, the medicines regulator clarified, asserting that this drug had been imported and used in the country without its approval.",

        "title": "Kevin McCarthy ousted as US House Speaker in historic vote",
        "date": "October 4, 2023 07:44 am",
        "content": "(Reuters) - A handful of Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives on Tuesday ousted Republican Speaker Kevin McCarthy, as party infighting plunged Congress into further chaos just days after it narrowly averted a government shutdown. The 216-to-210 vote marked the first time in history that the House removed its leader, with eight Republicans voting with 208 Democrats to remove McCarthy. McCarthy told reporters he would not make another run for speaker. I fought for what I believe in, McCarthy said. I believe I can continue to fight, but maybe in a different manner. The House looked set to go leaderless for at least a week, as multiple Republicans said they planned to meet on Oct. 10 to discuss possible McCarthy successors, with a vote on a new speaker planned for Oct. 11. Tuesdays rebellion was led by Representative Matt Gaetz, a far-right Republican from Florida and McCarthy antagonist who finally turned on the speaker after he on Saturday relied on Democratic votes to help pass a bill to avoid a partial government shutdown. Kevin McCarthy is a creature of the swamp. He has risen to power by collecting special interest money and redistributing that money in exchange for favors. We are breaking the fever now, Gaetz told reporters after the vote. It was the latest moment of high drama in a year when the Republican-controlled House brought Washington to the brink of a catastrophic default on U.S. debt of 31.4 trillion and a partial government shutdown. Republicans control the chamber by a narrow 221-212 majority, meaning they can afford to lose no more than five votes if Democrats unite in opposition. McCarthys ouster as speaker brings legislative activity in the House to a halt, with another government shutdown deadline looming Nov. 17 if Congress does not extend funding. The White House said it hoped the House would move swiftly to choose a replacement speaker, a position second in line to the presidency after the vice president. UNCHARTED WATERS The vote left Congress in uncharted waters as it scrambles to update farm-subsidy and nutrition programs, pass government funding bills and consider further aid to Ukraine. It was unclear who would succeed McCarthy. McCarthy had repeatedly angered Democrats in recent weeks, including by launching an impeachment inquiry into Biden and on Saturday by giving them little time to read a stopgap spending bill to avert a government shutdown that he needed their votes to pass. Democrats could have saved McCarthy but, after considering it, said they would not help Republicans resolve their own problems. Other Republican leaders like Steve Scalise and Tom Emmer could possibly be candidates, though neither has publicly expressed interest. Representative Patrick McHenry was named to the post on a temporary basis. The last two Republican speakers, Paul Ryan and John Boehner, retired from Congress after clashes with their right wing. In debate on the House floor, Gaetz and a handful of allies criticized McCarthy for relying on Democratic votes to pass temporary funding that headed off a partial government shutdown. We need a speaker who will fight for something - anything - other than staying on as speaker, said Republican Representative Bob Good. Representative Nancy Mace told reporters she voted to remove McCarthy as speaker because he broke promises to her on improving access to birth control and supporting a bill she wrote on rape kits. Ive made deals with Kevin McCarthy, with the speaker, that he has not kept to help women in this country, Mace said. We have done nothing for them. McCarthys supporters, including some of the chambers most vocal conservatives, said McCarthy had successfully limited spending and advanced other conservative priorities even though Democrats control the White House and the Senate. Think long and hard before you plunge us into chaos, because thats where were headed, said Republican Representative Tom Cole. NO DEMOCRATIC SUPPORT Democrats said they viewed McCarthy as untrustworthy after he broke a May agreement on spending with Biden. Let them wallow in their pigsty of incompetence, Representative Pramila Jayapal told reporters before the vote. Gaetz was one of more than a dozen Republicans who repeatedly voted against McCarthys bid for speaker in January. McCarthy ultimately secured the gavel after 15 rounds of voting over four days. To win the job, McCarthy agreed to rules that made it easier to challenge his leadership. McCarthy supporters have said Gaetz was motivated by a hunger for publicity, a chance to win higher office or resentment over an ongoing ethics probe into possible sexual misconduct and illicit drug use. Gaetz has denied wrongdoing and said he is not motivated by a dislike of McCarthy. This isnt a critique of the individual - its a critique of the job. The job hasnt been done, he said.

        "date": "October 4, 2023 09:19 am",
        "content": "In a joint initiative aimed at fostering energy efficiency among businesses and simplifying energy usage reporting, the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) has partnered with the Sri Lanka Sustainable Energy Authority (SLSEA) to unveil a groundbreaking tool. On September 14, USAID, in collaboration with SLSEA through its Sri Lanka Energy Program, introduced the National Energy Benchmarking Portal (NEBP), in US Embassy in Colombo said in a press release. This innovative platform is designed to assist businesses in curbing electricity consumption by promoting efficient practices and conservation methods, thereby addressing the challenges posed by escalating energy costs. The launch of NEBP marks a significant step toward a more sustainable and energy-efficient future for businesses in Sri Lanka. The NEBP is the result of two years of collaboration between USAID, SLSEA and select private organizations. The portal is a digital solution to disseminate energy consumption data and will be managed by SLSEA as a central repository for energy consumption data from all industrial, commercial, and government facilities in Sri Lanka, starting with supermarkets and the financial sector. Organizations can submit their energy consumption and other data required for benchmarking through the portal, which contains data from a companys own facilities and allows a company to compare its performance against the SLSEA benchmarks. The portal will improve the efficiency and accuracy of data entry and analysis for nearly one million consumer accounts, allowing for identification and comparison of consumption patterns in real time. Christopher Powers, Director of Economic Growth at USAIDSri Lanka, called the new portal a critical tool to support energy efficiency initiatives. USAID, through the Sri Lanka Energy Program, aims to introduce clean energy and reduce excess energy use across Sri Lanka. This portal is a critical tool that will support USAID investments to power an energy sector that is secure, efficient and sustainable, he said. We initiated mandatory energy efficiency and conservation (EEC) program many years after voluntary programs failed to impress the majority of Sri Lankan enterprises, said Ranjith Sepala, SLSEA chairman. Due to their low-cost energy supply, businesses rarely make energy efficiency and conservation investments despite their financial appeal. Now, with realistic energy prices, is the ideal time to engage businesses in EEC, and we appreciate USAIDs assistance in digitizing our process.",

        "date": "October 4, 2023 10:24 am",
        "content": "A metal detector has indicated that the injured elephant Sita of Mahiyangana Perahera had been shot with live bullets. This piece of information came to light following a scan conducted on Tuesday (Oct. 03), Prof. Ashoka Dangolla of Peradeniya Universitys Faculty of Veterinary Medicine and Animal Science mentioned. The 48-year-old elephant was mistakenly shot by an officer of the Civil Security Department (CSD) after the Mahiyanganaya Rajamaha Vihara annual Perahera on Saturday morning (Sept. 30). Prof. Dangolla, speaking further on the matter, said it is now clear that Sita shot with live bullets and that several fragments of metal are inert in the 7 wounds the elephant has sustained. We are sure that these are live bullets. These should be removed, but we have yet to take a decision. It was reported that following the procession, the elephant had been tied to a tree near the banks of the Mahaweli River, where the officer in question had shot Sita after mistaking it for a wild elephant that had crossed the river. The incident took place at around 3.30 a.m. The mahout, who said he was having breakfast when the incident happened, accused the officer of shooting the elephant despite people telling him that Sita was not a wild elephant. The injured 48-year-old elephant was later treated by veterinary surgeons of the Wildlife Conservation Department. In a statement, the Director General of the Wildlife Conservation Department, M.G.C. Sooriyabandara had said that one of the wildlife officers at the site had mistakenly fired rubber bullets at the female elephant Sita in a bid to scare off the wild elephants in the vicinity. On Sunday (Oct. 01), the Defence Ministry explained that as elephants from different parts of the country participate in the annual Mahiyangana Perahera, the chief prelate of the Mahiyangana temple had requested the Wildlife Department to establish a wildlife team in the temple to drive out wild elephants as there is frequent roaming of these animals in the area. In response to the request, a team of Wildlife Department officers along with one CSD personnel had been entrusted to drive away the wild elephants. Accordingly, the Defence Ministry said it has initiated a formal internal investigation on the directives of Acting Defence Minister Premitha Bandara Tennakoon. The ministry has promised to take disciplinary action against the CSD personnel for misconduct if he was found to have committed any disciplinary offense while on duty.",

        "date": "October 4, 2023 12:23 pm",
        "content": "At least 21 people died on Tuesday and 18 were injured after a bus carrying tourists to a campground crashed off an overpass near Venice in northern Italy and caught fire, city officials said. The bus veered off the road and fell close to railway lines in the district of Mestre, which is connected to Venice by a bridge. The cause of the accident was unclear. Venice city councillor Renato Boraso said one line of enquiry was that the driver, a 40-year-old Italian who was among those killed, had been taken ill before the crash. Its an appalling tragedy, the city is in mourning, Boraso told Sky Italia television. He said the coach had been carrying 40 passengers, of whom 21 had died and 18 were injured. The death toll could rise because several of those hurt were in a critical condition, he added. Venices city hall said the injured people had been taken to nearby hospitals, with four in a serious condition. Officials said the vehicle fell around 15 metres (50 feet) onto electricity lines and caught fire at around 7:45 p.m. local time (1745 GMT). Its an apocalyptic scene. I am speechless, Venices Mayor Luigi Brugnaro posted on X, formerly known as Twitter. Five of the victims were Ukrainians and one was German, said Venices prefect Michele Di Bari, the local representative of the interior ministry. The bus was also carrying passengers from France and Croatia, Italian news agency ANSA reported. The bus is totally crushed. The firefighters had difficulty getting a lot of the bodies out, Di Bari told Sky Italia television. He said two children were among the victims. Late on Tuesday evening, rescuers were still struggling to remove the wreckage of the bus to make sure no more passengers were trapped inside. Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni expressed her condolences, saying in a statement that her governments thoughts were with the victims, their families and their friends. Italy has suffered a number of deadly bus crashes in recent years. In 2017, 16 people on board a bus carrying Hungarian students died in an accident near the northern city of Verona, while 40 people died in 2013 when a bus plunged off a viaduct in southern Italy.

General Secretary of Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) MP Ranjith Madduma Bandara, SJBs Rehan Jayawickrema and Freedom Peoples Congress (FPC) member Prof. G.L. Peiris filed the petition today (Oct. 04), naming the Attorney General as its respondent. The petitioners point out that the Bill, which was published in the government gazette on September 18 and presented to the parliament yesterday (Oct. 03), violates the fundamental rights of the countrys people. Accordingly, they have voiced concerns about the Bill empowering the Online Safety Commission to determine the rights of the citizens and issue directives on persons without a hearing. The Bill takes away all procedural safeguards known to the law such as the right to a hearing and notice prior to any determinations of the rights of the citizens, they explained. In addition, the President having the sole discretion to appoint the Online Safety Commission and its members makes way for the exercise of arbitrary powers, the petitioners further pointed out. Another argument put forward by the petitioners is that the clauses of the Bill are excessively onerous and disproportionate in the measures that the Online Safety Commission may impose. In particular, the provisions of Clause 12 of the Bill are vague and permit the exercise of arbitrary powers and do not pursue any legitimate goals or objectives recognized by Article 15 of the Constitution, the petitioners added. Accordingly, the petitioners have sought a Supreme Court order declaring that the Online Safety Bill be passed with a special majority of the parliament and approved by the people at a referendum. On Tuesday (Oct. 03), social activist and independent journalist Tharindu Uduwaragedara filed a petition against the Online Safety Bill, alleging that certain provisions do not comply with the Constitution.",

        "date": "October 4, 2023 03:00 pm",
        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe has emphasised that all media outlets, including social media, should engage in a discussion regarding whether to enter into international agreements or adhere to the respective countrys legal framework. He made these remarks during his attendance at the ceremony, held at the Presidential Secretariat on Tuesday (03 Oct.), in honour of the distinguished figure in Sri Lankan journalism, Edmund Ranasinghe, the founding Editor and Editorial Director of the Diwaina, newspaper. Addressing the gathering, the Head of State pointed out that the advent of social media has led to a situation where some entities publish content according to their own whims, circumventing established regulations, and thus emphasised that media in any country must operate within the framework of its own laws. The future of media art will undoubtedly unfold in the coming two or three years and expertise in this domain may emerge not just from New York but also from Sri Lanka, President Wickremesinghe said. This event marked the inauguration of a program initiated by President Ranil Wickremesinghe to pay tribute to senior journalists who have made significant contributions to the field of journalism in the country. During the ceremony, the book Edmunds Newspaper Revolution, a compilation recognizing Mr. Ranasinghes seven decades of media dedication at the age of 93, was also unveiled. This book was authored by Presidential Senior Adviser Prof. Sunanda Madduma Bandara and edited by Presidential Media Director Mr. W. M. K. Wijebandara and Deputy Media Director Deepti Adhikari. Addressing the event, President Wickremesinghe said; In 1977, when I initially ran for election in the Biyagama Constituency, I sought out a skilled journalist to write an article for me. My father promptly recommended Edmund Ranasinghe, who subsequently penned my first political article. I held onto it until last year, but regrettably, I no longer possess it. During my fathers tenure as the Chairman of Lake House, Mr. Edmund Ranasinghe served admirably as the Editor of newspapers such as Silumina and Dinamina. Piyasena Nishanka and M.A. Silva, along with Martin Wickramasinghe, received recognition from senior journalists and writers. Consequently, Mr. Ranasinghe possesses substantial experience in both the media landscape that existed before independence and the one that emerged thereafter. In 1953, when rice prices surged, Mr. Dudley Senanayake was compelled to resign as Prime Minister. Sixty-nine years later, Gotabaya Rajapaksa faced a similar predicament over fuel shortages. Throughout these 69 years, Mr. Ranasinghe has amassed a wealth of experience, making him capable of writing a comprehensive book on the subject. Mr. Ranasinghe played a pivotal role in the press struggle of 1964 and his experiences undeniably left an indelible mark on the media culture of our nation. However, the landscape of print media is undergoing significant changes. Journalism, once reliant on lead type, has evolved to include tools like the iPad. The capacity to swiftly access knowledge, even within a venerable institution like the Lake House Institute, has been realized through technological advancements. Consequently, technology has become an invaluable tool for advancing the field of journalism. The event saw the presence of notable figures, including Prime Minister Dinesh Gunawardena, Minister of Mass Media Dr. Bandula Gunawardena, State Minister of Mass Media Shanta Bandara, Member of Parliament, Attorney Premanath C. Dolowatta, Presidents Senior Adviser on National Security and Chief of Presidential Staff Sagala Ratnayaka, Presidents Senior Adviser on Climate Change Ruwan Wijewardena, Presidents Secretary Saman Ekanayake, Secretary of the Ministry of Mass Media Anusha Palpita, Government Information Director General Dinith Chinthaka Karunaratne, and distinguished senior journalists, along with a multitude of journalists who gathered to commemorate this occasion.",

        "date": "October 4, 2023 03:53 pm",
        "content": "Three scientists won the Nobel Prize in chemistry for their work on tiny quantum dots. Moungi Bawendi, of MIT, Louis Brus, of Columbia University, and Alexei Ekimov, of Nanocrystals Technology Inc., were honored for their work with the tiny particles that are just a few atoms in diameter and whose electrons have constrained movement. This effects how they absorb and release visible light, allowing for very bright colors. They are used in many electronics, like LED displays. These tiny particles have unique properties and now spread their light from television screens and LED lamps. They catalyze chemical reactions and their clear light can illuminate tumor tissue for a surgeon, according to the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, which announced the award in Stockholm. In a highly unusual turn of events, Swedish media reported the names of the winners before the prize was announced. The academy did not comment on the leaked names before the announcement. The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, which awards the physics, chemistry and economics prizes, asks for nominations a year in advance from thousands of university professors and other scholars around the world. A committee for each prize then discusses candidates in a series of meetings throughout the year. At the end of the process, the committee presents one or more proposals to the full academy for a vote. The deliberations, including the names of nominees other than the winners, are kept confidential for 50 years. On Tuesday, the physics prize went to French-Swedish physicist Anne LHuillier, French scientist Pierre Agostini and Hungarian-born Ferenc Krausz for producing the first split-second glimpse into the superfast world of spinning electrons. The tiny part of each atom races around the center and is fundamental to virtually everything: chemistry, physics, our bodies and our gadgets. On Monday, Hungarian-American Katalin Karikó and American Drew Weissman won the Nobel Prize in medicine for discoveries that enabled the creation of mRNA vaccines against COVID-19. Last year, Americans Carolyn R. Bertozzi and K. Barry Sharpless, and Danish scientist Morten Meldal were jointly awarded the Nobel Prize in chemistry for developing a way of  snapping molecules together that can be used to explore cells, map DNA and design drugs that can target diseases such as cancer more precisely. The chemistry prize means Nobel season has reached its halfway stage. The prizes in literature, peace and economics follow, with one announcement every weekday until Oct. 9. The Nobel Foundation raised the prize money by 10 this year to 11 million kronor (about 1 million). In addition to the money, winners receive an 18-carat gold medal and diploma when they collect their Nobel Prizes at the award ceremonies in December. Source - AP News - Agencies",

        "date": "October 4, 2023 05:04 pm",
        "content": "Crisis-hit Sri Lanka will focus on improving tax collection to reduce budget deficits as it streamlines the structure of the tax system, the Treasury Secretary said on Wednesday, with new legislation planned to improve public finances. The steps follow comments by the International Monetary Fund, which blamed an expected shortfall in government revenue generation for its failure to reach a staff-level pact with Sri Lanka after a 2.9-billion bailout package in late September. Sri Lanka has to strike a very delicate balance, Treasury Secretary Mahinda Siriwardana said. It is imperative that historically high budget deficits must be reduced through better tax collection and improvement in tax administration...to recover from the financial crisis. Besides tackling debt management, the government wants to restructure loss-making state-owned enterprises, he said, with plans to introduce new legislation to reform loss-making commercial public firms before the end of the year. Loss-making state-run enterprises have also placed a massive burden on state banks, Siriwardana said. These multiple challenges can only be addressed by reducing the strain on the Treasury. The IMF had urged Sri Lanka to strengthen tax administration, scrap exemptions and stamp out evasion so as to boost revenues and signal better governance. The failure to sign a staff-level agreement in the first review following the bailout package could delay release of a second tranche of funds. Sri Lanka is planning to privatise its loss-making state-run carrier SriLankan Airlines in the second quarter of 2024, said Suresh Shah, the head of the state-owned Enterprises Restructuring Unit (SOERU). About another 130 loss-making entities will also be restructured and about 85 can be privatised, Shah said. Sri Lanka is also separately looking at restructuring its energy, water, and fuel distribution monopoly businesses as part of efforts to overhaul its public finances under the IMF program.

Speaking at a press conference held at the Ministrys premises this afternoon (04 Oct.), Minister of Agriculture Mahinda Amaraweera explained that owing to the arid weather conditions faced earlier, nearly 70,000 acres of paddy cultivation, while hundreds of acres of cultivated land which were ready for harvest were also destroyed due to the recent torrential rains. Speaking further on the vegetable crops that were destroyed in the Southern Province due to the heavy rains, Amaraweera revealed that nearly 15,000 acres of cultivated mung beans which were ready for harvest in Hambantota were destroyed, emphasisng that nearly 40 of Sri Lankas mung bean requirement could have been covered with this harvest. Thus, further emphasising the possible risk of a food shortage within the country, Minister Amaraweera advised the Secretary to the Agriculture Ministry, Gunadasa Samarasinghe, that programmes encouraging the growing of vegetable crops in gardens, and other such programmes to maximise the harvest during the upcoming Maha cultivation season be implemented immediately. Meanwhile, the Department of Agriculture was also requested to submit a report on the total damage caused to crops due to the extreme weather.",
