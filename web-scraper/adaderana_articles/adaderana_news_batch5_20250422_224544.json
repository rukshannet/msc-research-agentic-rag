        "date": "March 25, 2025 09:29 pm",
        "content": "The United States said on Tuesday it has reached separate agreements with Ukraine and Russia to ensure safe navigation in the Black Sea and to implement a ban on attacks by the two countries on each others energy facilities. The agreements, if implemented, would represent the clearest progress yet towards a wider ceasefire that Washington sees a stepping stone towards peace talks to bring an end to Russias three-year-old war in Ukraine. Russia, however, said it could not trust Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy and it could therefore only sign a Black Sea deal if Washington issued an order to him to respect it. We will need clear guarantees. And given the sad experience of agreements with just Kyiv, the guarantees can only be the result of an order from Washington to Zelenskiy and his team to do one thing and not the other, Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said in televised comments. It was not immediately clear whether Moscows demand risked derailing the deal. Zelenskiy has previously said Russian President Vladimir Putin, who sent troops into Ukraine in February 2022, is not to be trusted over peace moves. Ukraines defence minister said Kyiv had agreed to both a maritime ceasefire and a pause by Russia and Ukraine in attacks on each others energy infrastructure. Seeking to fulfil a pledge by President Donald Trump to end the war quickly, the U.S. originally proposed a full 30-day ceasefire - to which Ukraine agreed in principle on March 11 - as a step towards peace talks. But the Americans held separate talks in Saudi Arabia with Russia and Ukraine this week to discuss more limited ceasefires on energy and at sea, after Putin responded to the wider truce plan with a long list of conditions and questions.

        "date": "March 26, 2025 06:32 am",
        "content": "Human rights activist, professor, and lawyer Prathibha Mahanamahewa emphasized the need for an investigation committee to review the proposal seeking the removal of Inspector General of Police (IGP) Deshabandu Tennakoon, who is currently in remand custody and suspended from his duties. Explaining the constitutional process for removing an IGP, Prof. Mahanamahewa stated, When a proposal to remove the IGP is submitted, an investigation committee has to be appointed. This committee is primarily nominated by the Chief Justice and includes a sitting Supreme Court judge, the Chairman of the National Police Commission, and a senior administrative official. They examine all aspects of the proposal and make a recommendation, which is then presented to Parliament. The IGP can only be removed if the motion is passed by a majority of the MPs present, he noted. A motion seeking the removal of Tennakoon was submitted to Speaker of Parliament, (Dr.) Jagath Wickramaratne on Tuesday (25) by a group of National Peoples Power (NPP) MPs. The motion, signed by 115 MPs, lists 27 corruption charges against the IGP. Meanwhile, Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa announced that the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) would fully support the motion. We stand firmly against corruption and abuse of power. The SJB will give its unconditional support to this motion, Premadasa said. Tennakoon, who faces charges in connection with a shooting incident near a hotel in the Weligama area, had surrendered to court nearly 20 days after an arrest warrant was issued over his involvement in the case. Following his surrender, the Matara Magistrate ordered that Tennakoon be remanded until April 3.",

        "content": "At least 16 people have died as multiple wildfires rage across South Koreas southeastern region. Deadly wildfires spread across South Koreas southeastern region on Tuesday, forcing thousands of residents to flee their homes and razing neighbourhoods, with authorities transferring hundreds of inmates from prisons. As of Wednesday 5 a.m. (2100 GMT), 12 people had died in a wildfire starting from Uiseong county, while four other deaths were linked to another fire from Sancheong county, according to the Safety Ministry. The Uiseong fire, only 68 contained and exacerbated by strong winds, shows unimaginable scale and speed, said Lee Byung-doo, a forest disaster expert at the National Institute of Forest Science. Acting President Han Duck-soo has vowed to deploy firefighting helicopters and ground personnel to battle the fires, fuelled by winds and dry weather. Dry conditions are expected to persist in the wildfire-hit region on Wednesday, the Safety Ministry said. Climate change is projected to make wildfires more frequent, Lee said, as wildfires that ravaged part of Los Angeles in January and a recent wildfire in northeast Japan are still relatively rare. We have to admit large-scale wildfires are going to increase and prepare more resources and manpower, he told a local television station. The casualties included four people who were trying to escape the fire but their vehicle was overturned. Three died and one was injured, Yonhap News Agency reported. The blazes that broke out on Saturday in Uiseong are yet to be contained, gutting ancient temples and destroying homes. The government has designated the affected areas as special disaster zones, and said the fires had damaged more than 15,000 hectares (37,065 acres). Source: Reuters --Agencies",

Signal has been growing in popularity in Europe and the United States as an alternative to WhatsApp because it collects very little data about its users.

In a February interview, opens new tab with De Telegraaf, a Dutch newspaper, Whittaker said Signal was a safer alternative because WhatsApp collects metadata which can be used to see who messages whom, and how often. When compelled, like all companies that collect the data to begin with, they turn this important, revealing data over, Whittaker said in her post on X. In a statement, a WhatsApp spokesperson said it relies on metadata to prevent spam and keep the service safe from abuse.

        "date": "March 26, 2025 07:48 am",
        "content": "The Monetary Policy Board of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) has decided to maintain the Overnight Policy Rate (OPR) at 8.00, citing confidence in the current monetary stance to guide inflation towards its 5 target while supporting economic growth. The decision has been made at the boards meeting held yesterday (25). Furthermore, the CBSL said that the Board remains confident that the prevailing monetary policy stance will ensure that inflation will move towards the target of 5 while supporting the growth of the domestic economy. Releasing the regular statement on the monetary policy review, CBSL highlighted, Inflation remains negative at present mainly due to repeated reductions in electricity tariffs and fuel prices. Deflationary conditions are expected to gradually ease from March 2025, with inflation projected to turn positive by mid-2025. Meanwhile, the CBSL also noted that the projections based on the currently available data suggest that inflation would reach the targeted levels by year-end, adding that the latest annual estimates revealed that the domestic economy recorded a strong recovery in 2024 after two years of contractions. Recent developments in the economy and leading indicators point towards a continuation of this momentum. Rupee liquidity remains at surplus level. Market interest rates have continued to decline in line with the eased monetary policy stance. Supported by low interest rates, credit flows to the private sector remained robust, the countrys financial regulatory body highlighted. This trend is expected to continue, encouraging domestic economic activity, the CBSL mentioned, adding that the external sector performance has been more favourable than expected. Exports have remained strong, while imports have gained traction causing the trade deficit to widen. Earnings from tourism and workers remittances helped improve the external current account. Foreign inflows to the government securities market have risen recently reflecting improved confidence. Increased net foreign purchases by the Central Bank and the receipt of the fourth tranche of the IMF-EFF programme helped increase official reserves enhancing resilience. The Sri Lanka rupee saw a marginal depreciation thus far in 2025, the CBSL noted. The regular statement on the monetary policy review further mentioned that risks to the inflation and growth outlook remain broadly in balance, however, the Board is watchful, among other things, of the possible impact of global trade and geopolitical uncertainties on the Sri Lankan economy. As such, monetary policy formulation will continue to be based on a forwardlooking and data-dependent approach. The Board stands ready to respond to emerging risks to maintaining price stability while supporting the economy to reach its potential, it added. The release of the next regular statement on the monetary policy review will be on 28 May 2025.",

        "date": "March 26, 2025 09:45 am",
        "content": "A Gazette notification has been issued for the implementation of a maximum retail pricing mechanism for medicinal drugs. The regulations, published in the gazette by the Minister of Health and Mass Media, Dr. Nalinda Jayatissa, are aimed at ensuring transparency, fairness, and affordability in the pricing of medicines. The Medicines (Pricing Mechanism for Medicines) Regulations, No. 01 of 2025, published in the Gazette Extraordinary yesterday (25), introduce a structured system for determining the Maximum Retail Price (MRP) and Maximum Ceiling Price (MCP) for medicines sold in the country. Key Highlights of the Regulations: 1. MRP Calculation: The Maximum Retail Price will be determined based on the Cost, Insurance, and Freight (CIF), Duties and Taxes (DT), and a Supply Chain Total Markup (SCTM). The exchange rate will be considered based on the average value of the past three months, as published by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL). 2. MCP Calculation: The Maximum Ceiling Price for medicines will be determined by considering retail prices across different pharmacies and market shares of brands and generics. A statistical method involving the median retail price will be used. 3. Regulation Enforcement: Medicines cannot be sold above the MCP. If a products MRP is lower than the MCP, it cannot be increased. The authorities reserve the right to revise the MRP and MCP periodically based on market conditions and fluctuations in exchange rates. 4. New Registration: For newly registered medicines, if the calculated MRP exceeds the MCP, the MCP will be adopted as the price. 5. Penalties for Non-Compliance: Sellers who violate the pricing regulations will be subject to penalties under the National Medicines Regulatory Authority Act. The Authority may review the MRP biannually. However, it may also revise the MRP if there is a fluctuation in the exchange rate beyond an accepted tolerance level, which the Authority will consider necessary in the public interest. Additionally, the Authority has the legal right to recall MRPs issued based on market conditions and improve access to medicines by substituting them with a new MRP.

        "date": "March 26, 2025 09:47 am",
        "content": "A Japanese man who spent more than 40 years on death row until he was acquitted last year has been awarded 1.4 million in compensation, a court said on Tuesday  roughly 85 for each day he was wrongfully convicted. Former professional boxer Iwao Hakamata, 89, was sentenced to death in 1968 for a quadruple murder despite repeatedly alleging that the police had fabricated evidence against him. Once the worlds longest-serving death row inmate, he was acquitted after a DNA test showed that the bloodstained clothing which was used to convict him was planted long after the murders, according to Japanese public broadcaster NHK. The Shizuoka District Court confirmed to CNN that Hakamata had been awarded more than 217 million yen  a payout that represents about US85 per day since he was found guilty. His legal representative Hideyo Ogawa described the compensation as the highest amount ever handed out for a wrongful conviction in Japan, but said it could never make up for what Hakamata had suffered. I think the state (government) has made a mistake that cannot be atoned for with 200 million yen, the lawyer said, according to NHK. I think the state (government) has made a mistake that cannot be atoned for with 200 million yen, the lawyer said, according to NHK. Hakamata retired as a professional boxer in 1961 and got a job at a soybean processing plant in Shizuoka, central Japan. Five years later he was arrested by police after his boss, his boss wife and their two children were found stabbed to death in their home. Hakamata initially admitted to the charges against him, but later changed his plea, accusing police of forcing him to confess by beating and threatening him. He was sentenced to death in a 2-1 decision by judges in 1968. The one dissenting judge stepped down from the bar six months later, demoralized by his inability to stop the sentencing. Hakamata, who has maintained his innocence ever since, would go on to spend more than half his life waiting to be hanged. New evidence led to his release in 2014 pending a retrial, which acquitted him last year. His case brought global scrutiny to Japans criminal justice system, where conviction rates stand at 99, according to the Ministry of Justice website, and fueled calls to abolish the death penalty in the country. Hakamatas sister Hideko, who had long campaigned for his release, told CNN last year that decades of imprisonment had wrought irreversible damage on her brothers mental health. Hakamata was living in his own world, she said. Sometimes he smiles happily, but thats when hes in his delusion We have not even discussed the trial with Iwao because of his inability to recognize reality. Source: CNN --Agencies",

        "date": "March 26, 2025 09:53 am",
        "content": "Prime Minister Harini Amarasuriya emphasized that gender inequality is not just a womens issue, but a societal challenge requiring policy changes, education, and attitudinal transformation. The Prime Minister made these remarks while attending the official launch of THRIVE- Together for Her: Resilience-building, Inclusivity, and Voices for Equality in Sri Lanka, held yesterday (25) at the Australian High Commission in Colombo which was jointly hosted by the High Commissioner of Australia, UN Women, and Chrysalis, according to the Prime Ministers Media Division. THRIVE is a five-year initiative implemented by UN Women and Chrysalis, and funded by the Government of Australia. This project contributes to achieving Outcome 6  Gender Equality and Womens Empowerment  of the UN Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework for Sri Lanka 2023-2027, which has been co-signed by the Government of Sri Lanka and the United Nations, guiding the work of the UN system in Sri Lanka, the statement said. The project aims to advance gender equality and womens empowerment in Sri Lanka by strengthening the economic and social resilience of marginalized women to navigate and recover from crises, insecurity, and the impacts of climate change aiming women with disabilities, women-headed households, and women in the plantation sector across six districts  Mannar, Kilinochchi, Nuwara Eliya, Badulla, Moneragala, and Colombo. Delivering the keynote address, Prime Minister Amarasuriya emphasized the need for structural and attitudinal change for ensuring gender parity and eliminate violence against women, the statement added. Sri Lanka ranks high on the Human Development Index, with a literacy rate exceeding 92, and over 60 of university students being women. However, only 35 of women participate in the paid workforce. It is necessary to find ways and means to ensure that women have opportunities to contribute towards the economy through employment opportunities and equal pay with given a dully acknowledge and recognize unpaid work and unpaid care work, which are often disproportionately carried out by women. The Parliament of Sri Lanka adopted the Women Empowerment Act in 2024 which includes the establishment of an independent National Commission on Women to oversee womens rights, and to create of a National Fund for Women. The administrative process for appointing the Commissioners is currently underway. Further, as a government, we have implemented several benefits for women and young women under the national budget. As Minister of Education, I can confidently say that we have allocated funds to ensure children from marginalized communities have access to education including providing free uniforms, shoes, sanitary facilities, meals, books, and a stipend, ensuring that no child drops out due to economic barriers. However, it is statistically proven that the 90 of women faced sexual harassment in public transport at least once in their lifetime and the Global Gender Gap Index of Sri Lanka lists at 122 among 146 countries that marks gender disparity is not just a womens issue. It is a societal challenge that transcends gender, race, religion, and age. Moreover, new threats are emerging. While digital tools offer great potential for development and technological advancement, they are also being misused to silence women, amplify biases, and fuel harassment. It is essential to create an inclusive digital space where everyoneregardless of gender, race, religion, or agehas equal opportunities to thrive in the digital age. The government remains committed to closing the gender digital divide and ensuring that women, especially young women, can participate independently in the digital economy. Gender inequality is not a women issue, it is a societal issue that demands policy change, education, attitudinal and behavioural transformation. For countries like Sri Lanka, collaborative efforts like THRIVE are essential in creating a future where all women have equal opportunities to thrive. The event was attended by the Australian High Commissioner to Sri Lanka, Paul Stephens; UN Women Deputy Regional Director for Asia and the Pacific, Ms. Maria Holtsberg; United Nations Resident Coordinator, Mr. Marc-Andr Franche; and other esteemed dignitaries.",

        "date": "March 26, 2025 09:59 am",
        "content": "The Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of SriLankan Airlines Richard Nuttall states that as Sri Lankas economy recovers and tourism returns, SriLankan Airlines is benefiting from an operationally profitable period, marking three years of consistent performance. Nuttall emphasized that the airline is now focusing on expanding its fleet and services to accommodate rising demand. In a keynote interview at the Aviation Festival Asia 2025, Nuttall shared that SriLankan Airlines is currently working on a business plan that aims to double the size of the airline within the next five years. Nuttall explained that, in the short term, the airline plans to lease aircraft as they become available, noting that competition in the leasing market has driven up costs. He acknowledged the importance of planning for the long-term, especially considering the need to replace the airlines aging fleet, particularly the A330s. The airlines initial focus will be on increasing the frequency of flights to existing destinations, Nuttall expressed, pointing out that the competition in the region has intensified, with airlines from Southeast Asia doubling their capacity to Sri Lanka over the past year. Nuttall underscored the importance of tourism to both SriLankan Airlines and the countrys economy, noting that tourism is one of the largest earners of foreign currency and a significant employer and that in turn, the SriLankan Airlines play a key role in Sri Lankas tourism industry. He added that as the primary carrier for nearly 40 of Sri Lankas incoming tourists, the airline plays a critical role in the countrys tourism promotion efforts. We are the biggest single promoter of tourism to Sri Lanka, Nuttall said. The airlines marketing initiatives, which focus on promoting Sri Lanka as a destination rather than just the airline itself, are a key part of this effort. Nuttall also highlighted the airlines digital presence and collaborations with local tour operators to boost Sri Lankas visibility in the global market. We are the only organization with a name that people recognize and weve got a brand thats actually much bigger than the airline for historical reasons. We have people on the ground in all of the countries that we fly. If you watch SriLankan advertising its much more about the country than it is about the airline. I mean if you look at our inflight safety video, I think its got more hits than any other Airlines safety video but its all about views from the island - its spectacular. So, you know what we really do is we promote Sri Lanka, he added. Strategic Position and Regional Connectivity Nuttall emphasized SriLankan Airlines geographical advantage, noting the airlines strategic location in the Indian Ocean. The airline serves as a natural hub for flights connecting India, East Africa, and Southeast Asia. This position allows SriLankan Airlines to tap into growing regional demand, especially as the Indian market experiences significant growth. Ive worked for eight Airlines, its incredibly frustrating because the opportunity SriLankan has is massive. We are in a unique position, with our location allowing us to feed traffic from India and East Africa into Asia and beyond, Nuttall explained. He expressed confidence that the airlines role in regional connectivity, particularly in serving as an alternative to Gulf carriers, will continue to be an asset. Ownership and Investment Considerations When asked about the possibility of a strategic partnership, Nuttall confirmed that tourism is crucial to Sri Lankas national interests, and thus, the ownership and management of SriLankan Airlines should remain within Sri Lankan hands. However, he acknowledged that the airline is exploring different options for securing future investment, which may include public-private partnerships or even stock market listings. Its strategically important for Sri Lanka and therefore the control should be within Sri Lanka. So I think the view is that as far as possible that investment should be Sri Lankan. Now, the debate is going on at the moment as to how that actually operates. Is it the airline, is it subsidiaries, is it government money, is it public private partnerships, is it to go to the stock market, Nuttall explained. Decisions have not been made on that, but there are options and because of the growth of tourism and the growth of foreign airlines, the multiples are much more favourable than they would have been two years ago. So there are more options on the table, but the plan at the moment is as far as possible to keep the ownership and management within Sri Lanka, he said. Looking Forward With the airlines recovery in full swing, Nuttall is focused on SriLankan Airlines growth, aiming to expand its network, improve flight frequency, and invest in fleet modernization. Despite the challenges, Nuttall remains confident that with the right investment, SriLankan Airlines can significantly improve its position in the coming years. We are moving in the right direction, Nuttall said, adding, With the growth of tourism, the increasing demand for air travel, and our unique position in the market, we are well-placed for a strong future. This Airline could be in a really different place in a few years with the right investment, he signed off.",

        "title": "Sri Lankas economy still in critical care, govts role crucial  Ranil",
        "date": "March 26, 2025 11:41 am",
        "content": "Former President Ranil Wickremesinghe emphasized that it is the incumbent governments responsibility to ensure that Sri Lanka fully recovers from the economic crisis. He acknowledged that the previous government had made some progress toward economic recovery but stressed that the task of guiding the country out of the crisis now lies with the current administration. Speaking at the launch of the book The Panchayudha of Sri Lankas Economy, written by former Minister Dr. Bandula Gunawardena, Wickremesinghe urged the government to honor agreements made with investors during the previous regime, rather than introducing new proposals that could undermine investor confidence. He warned that such actions could erode the trust of investors and harm Sri Lankas reputation as a reliable destination for investment. Wickremesinghe compared the Sri Lankan economy to a patient who had been on life support and was now being weaned off but was still in critical care. He stressed the importance of the governments role in ensuring a full recovery for the economy, likening the task to taking proper care of a patient in intensive care. To grow the economy, we need both capital and technology. However, we lack sufficient capital to undertake these initiatives, nor do we have the necessary technology. Therefore, we must seek these resources from external sourcesjust as China and India have done, he stated. He expressed concern over recent government decisions, particularly the announcement requiring all companies in the energy sector to submit new proposals. Wickremesinghe warned that this could create uncertainty among investors, potentially leading them to view Sri Lanka as an unreliable place for investment. We must build confidence among investors and avoid actions that could shatter that trust by reverting to outdated methods. That is why I have been concerned in recent days. The government has announced that all companies involved in the energy sector must submit new proposals. This decision could create uncertainty among investors, making them believe that Sri Lanka is not a reliable place to invest. As a result, they may hesitate to come here. With great difficulty, we have managed to attract a few investors, and we must safeguard their confidence at all costs. The government must reconsider this decision and continue with the established approach, he added. Wickremesinghe also highlighted the significance of the agreement with Indias Adani Group, urging the government to continue with the Adani project, which he believes could be pivotal in boosting Sri Lankas economy. He mentioned his discussions with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, during which Modi expressed interest in purchasing power from Sri Lanka. The agreement with Indias Adani Group has become a significant factor. We must bring the Adani project to Sri Lanka. When I discussed this with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, he expressed interest in purchasing power from Sri Lanka. He noted that Sri Lanka could potentially supply between 25 and 50 gigawatts of power, which could result in a substantial inflow of investment. Although I am not fully aware of our electricity production capacity, I mentioned that we could supply between 25 and 50 gigawatts. If we can achieve this, imagine the level of investment that would flow into the country. Further emphasizing Sri Lankas relationship with India, Wickremesinghe remarked that India is a vital ally and that it is important not to give the impression of an anti-India stance. He recalled his visit to Delhi, where Indian officials raised concerns about Sri Lankas position toward India, urging the two countries to strengthen their relationship and continue to move forward together. We must not give such an impression. Instead, we must strengthen our relationship and move forward together, Wickremesinghe expressed.",

        "title": "Thai PM Paetongtarn Shinawatra sails through no-confidence vote in parliament",
        "date": "March 26, 2025 11:45 am",
        "content": "Thai Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra breezed through a no-confidence vote in parliament on Wednesday in the first test of her premiership, emerging unscathed from a two-day opposition onslaught to reaffirm the stability of her coalition. Thailands youngest premier won the backing of 319 of 488 lawmakers present, despite a barrage of barbs during a censure debate that accused her of being unqualified, lacking economic knowledge, evading tax, serving her wealthy family and taking direction from her billionaire father and political heavyweight Thaksin Shinawatra. The censure motion was an early test of Paetongtarns mandate more than seven months after she was unexpectedly thrust into the spotlight as a political neophyte who had never held public office, replacing ally Srettha Thavisin after his removal by a court for an ethics violation. She rejected all the allegations levelled at her. Despite her lukewarm ratings in opinion polls and economic growth far adrift of regional peers, Wednesdays vote showed Paetongtarns 11-party coalition remains solid, lowering the prospect of near-term instability in a country for two decades fraught with intermittent political turmoil. Every vote, both support and against, will be the strength for me and the cabinet to continue our work for the people, 38-year-old Paetongtarn posted on X social media, thanking her ruling alliance for its support. POLARISING TYCOON Multiple governments led by the Pheu Thai Party and its predecessors, all controlled by Thaksin, have been removed by courts or military coups since 2006, underscoring deep-rooted animosity between the polarising tycoon and powerful conservatives with influence over Thailands key institutions. The opposition Peoples Party, the biggest party in parliament, directed much of its attacks on Paetongtarns close relationship with her father, a former premier who is banned from holding office over a conviction for conflicts of interest and abuse of power that kept him in self-exile for 15 years. Thaksin, a former owner of English football giants Manchester City, has loomed large over Thai politics for 24 years and returned home in 2023. He spent six months in detention in hospital under a government led by Pheu Thai, before being released on parole and declaring he was retired from politics. He has since spoken openly and often about government policy but has repeatedly said he only offers his daughter advice. Paetongtarn, the fourth member of the Shinawatra family to hold the top job, had during the debate insisted she was giving her best for the country and should be judged by her work, not her family ties. Peoples Party leader Natthaphong Ruengpanyawut said that despite winning the confidence vote, Paetongtarn was still unfit for the job. The prime ministers abilities are still lacking, he said. And if Thailand has a prime minister without the right qualities, the nation will be at a loss. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "date": "March 26, 2025 11:50 am",
        "content": "Indias Supreme Court on Tuesday (March 25, 2025) allowed DMK leader T.R. Baalu to replace former Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M. Karunanidhi, who passed away in 2018, as petitioner in over a decade-old challenge against agreements entered into between India and Sri Lanka to cede Katchatheevu to the island nation. A three-judge Bench headed by Chief Justice of India Sanjiv Khanna heard a short preliminary submission by senior advocate P. Wilson, for the petitioner side, that the agreements made on June 26 and 28, 1974 and another one on March 23, 1976, along with related communications surrendering Katchatheevu to Sri Lanka, were unconstitutional and void. The court scheduled the case for final hearing on September 15, 2025. Mr. Wilson said his oral submissions would take a day approximately. The issue involved in this writ petition is the unconstitutional ceding of the island of Katchatheevu by the Prime Minister of India to the Island nation of Sri Lanka, completely disregarding the constitutional provisions and totally ignoring the federal polity of our country which is an integral part of the basic structure of the Constitution, the petition filed by Mr. Karunanidhi had said. The DMK patriarch had wanted a direction to protect the historic fishing rights and other traditional rights of Tamil Nadu fishermen in the waters of Palk Strait and Palk Bay and the waters around the island of Katchatheevu. He had sought a direction to the Union government to take appropriate actions to restore the pre-existing historic rights of the fishermen of Tamil Nadu to work the waters surrounding the island, take rest, dry their nets, worship in the Saint Antonys Church there and participate in the festival in the church. He had also sought a direction to the Centre to pay compensation for the loss of life and property suffered by Tamil Nadu fishermen. Tamil Nadu fishermens right to life, livelihood and the right to carry on fishing and other allied activities were infringed and abrogated by the Sri Lankan army and the navy, he had said. In 2013, the Centre had filed a response to a separate writ petition by former Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Jayalalithaas writ petition, informing the court that the question of retrieval of Kachchatheevu from Sri Lanka did not arise as no territory belonging to India was ceded to Sri Lanka. No territory belonging to India was ceded nor sovereignty relinquished since the area in question was in dispute and had never been demarcated Indian fishermen and pilgrims will enjoy access to visit Kachchatheevu and will not be required by Sri Lanka to obtain travel documents or visas for these purposes. The right of access is not to be understood to cover fishing rights around the island to Indian fishermen, the Centre had submitted. On the frequent incidents of firing against Indian fishermen by the Sri Lankan Navy and their arrest, the Centre had said the government has always taken up on a priority basis with Sri Lanka including at the highest levels any incident involving safety and security of Indian fishermen in the waters between two countries. Whenever Indian fishermen were arrested, the government of India intervened and got them released. Katchatheevu is an uninhabited island located about ten miles north east of Rameswaram on the Indian side and nine miles south of Delft Island on the Sri Lankan side. It has an area of 285.20 acres and is a mile and 300 yards at its widest. It has no permanent population and does not possess any economic wealth. But the sea waters surrounding it are rich in marine life, especially prawns and a favourite fishing place for Indian fishermen from the districts of Ramanathapuram, Pudukkottai, Thanjavur and Nagapattinam, who use the island as their resting place while drying their nets.

        "date": "March 26, 2025 11:52 am",
        "content": "Amazon MGM Studios have announced that Amy Pascal and David Heyman will produce the next James Bond movie - the companys first since gaining creative control of the famous spy film franchise. Pascal is best known for the three latest Spider-Man titles starring Tom Holland, while Heyman was behind all eight Harry Potter movies. In a statement on Tuesday, Amazon MGM Studios head of film, Courtenay Valenti, described them as two of the most accomplished, experienced, and respected film producers in our industry. In a joint statement, Pascal and Heyman called 007 one of the most iconic characters in the history of cinema. Long-serving masterminds Barbara Broccoli and Michael G Wilson announced they were stepping down from the franchise in February, giving creative control to Amazon MGM Studios, which was formed when Amazon bought Bonds parent studio in 2022. The Bond films were launched by Albert Cubby Broccoli in 1962, before his daughter and stepson took over. We are humbled to follow in the footsteps of Barbara Broccoli and Michael Wilson who made so many extraordinary films and honoured and excited to keep the spirit of Bond very much alive as he embarks on his next adventure, noted Pascal and Heyman. Amazons Valenti added: We are honoured to be working with them on James Bonds next chapter and are excited to deliver to global audiences storytelling that upholds the impeccable legacy of this beloved character. The new deal came after mounting speculation about the fate of the British spy, four years after his last outing in No Time to Die, which was also Daniel Craigs fifth and final appearance in the role. Following the announcement last month, Amazon boss Jeff Bezos asked his 6.8 million followers on X: Whod you pick as the next Bond? Amazon and its chosen producers will now decide which actor will take over the famous character, but there is still no timescale for when that that will happen or when the next film will be made. James Norton, Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Theo James are among the bookmakers favourites to fill Craigs shoes. Pascal recently produced Challengers, starring Zendaya, and was also behind the Spider-Verse film series. Heyman is currently in pre-production on the Harry Potter television series and in post-production on Taika Waititis adaptation of Kazuo Ishigurus Klara and the Sun, starring Jenna Ortega and Amy Adams. The Hollywood power duo are also working together on Noah Baumbachs Jay Kelly, starring George Clooney and Adam Sandler. Source: BBC --Agencies",

        "date": "March 26, 2025 11:56 am",
        "content": "A Palestinian Oscar winner who activists say was attacked by Israeli settlers before being detained by the Israeli military has been released, his co-director has said. Hamdan Ballal, who co-directed No Other Land, had his house in the Israeli-occupied West Bank surrounded by settlers during an attack on Monday, the activists said. His co-director Yuval Abraham - who said Mr Ballal was beaten by settlers then taken by soldiers while in an ambulance, which the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) denied - said on Tuesday afternoon that Mr Ballal had been freed. The IDF said three Palestinians and an Israeli had been detained on suspicion of rock hurling at security forces. The five activists from the Center for Jewish Nonviolence group (CJNV) said they had gone to the village to document the incident and had come under attack themselves, with settlers smashing their car windows, and punching and hitting them with sticks. Earlier, an activist who was at the scene told the BBC the three detained Palestinians, including Mr Ballal, were injured in the settler attack and had been held at an Israeli police station in the West Bank. They are suspected of throwing stones and injuring a young settler shepherd and were interrogated, the activist said, adding that they had access to a lawyer. The attack began at about 18:00 (16:00 GMT) on Monday, when around a dozen masked settlers mounted an attack in the village of Susya, according to the activists. Mr Ballals house is reported to have been surrounded by the settlers. Yuval Abraham, the Israeli director who won the Oscar this month alongside Mr Ballal, said people had been injured and properties destroyed in the attack. The activist who spoke to the BBC said they had complained to the Israeli soldiers that they were under attack. They said the army initially watched the attack, then approached only as the assault on the car was ending. The soldiers then refused to pursue the settlers, leaving them free to attack houses on the other side of the hill, the activist said. The IDF confirmed that soldiers and police had arrived to disperse the confrontation. They said rocks had been hurled at security forces. In response, the forces apprehended three Palestinians suspected of hurling rocks at them, as well as an Israeli civilian involved in the violent confrontation, the IDF said. The detainees were taken for further questioning by the Israel Police. An Israeli citizen was injured in the incident and was evacuated to receive medical treatment. No Other Land - which picked up best documentary at the 97th Academy Awards - follows the fight over Masafer Yatta, a community of about 20 villages, and the friendship between Adra and Abraham. Israel has occupied the West Bank since 1967. Israeli settlements in the territory are considered illegal under international law, though Israel disputes this. They have expanded over the past 55 years, becoming a focal point for violence and conflicting claims over land. Since the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war in 2023, settler violence against Palestinian civilians in the West Bank has surged. Source: BBC ---Agencies",

        "content": "Twenty Sri Lankan prisoners held at Kuwaits Central Jail have been repatriated to Sri Lanka this afternoon (26) under the Kuwait-Sri Lanka Prisoner Exchange Agreement. They arrived at Bandaranaike International Airport aboard a special Kuwaiti Air Force flight. The prisoner exchange agreement, first signed in 2007, facilitated the return of 32 Sri Lankan inmates in early 2024. With this latest transfer, a total of 52 Sri Lankan prisoners have been repatriated under the arrangement. However, it was reported that no Kuwaiti prisoners are currently in Sri Lankas custody to the date for exchange. The returnees had been convicted of various offenses in Kuwait, including drug use, drug trafficking, and smuggling. They were arrested by Kuwaiti authorities, prosecuted, and subsequently sentenced to prison terms. Upon arrival, Sri Lankas Prison Department officials took custody of the prisoners, who were later transferred to the Welikada Magazine Prison in Colombo.",

        "content": "Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa has categorically denied the UK governments allegations of widespread human rights violations during Sri Lankas military operations against the LTTE and called on the incumbent government to resolutely stand by and defend former armed forces personnel who face persecution by foreign governments and organisations. Issuing a statement regarding the recent decision by the UK government to impose sanctions including travel bans and asset freezes against Sri Lankas former Chief of Defence Staff Shavendra Silva, former Navy Commander Wasantha Karannagoda and former Army Commander Jagath Jayasuriya, the then-President Rajapaksa expressed displeasure that the action comes over unproven allegations of human rights violations during the war with the LTTE. Rajapaksa also alleged that imposing sanctions on Vinayagamoorthy Muralitharan also known as Karuna Amman, who broke away from the LTTE in 2004 and later entered democratic politics, is a clear case of penalizing anti-LTTE Tamils so as to placate the dominant segment of the Tamil diaspora in the UK. Three decades of LTTE terrorism claimed the lives of 27,965 armed forces and police personnel not to mention the lives of many thousands of civilians including politicians. What Sri Lanka defeated in 2009 was the organization that the US Federal Bureau of Investigation had officially designated as the deadliest terrorist organization in the world. It is noteworthy that the United Kingdom introduced special legislation in 2021 and 2023 to protect their own armed forces from persecution by interested parties, Rajapaksa pointed out. I categorically reject the UK govt.s allegation of widespread human rights violations during the military operations, he reiterated. The former President called on the current government to defend the former defence personnel from foreign powers, stating, I expect the present government to resolutely stand by and defend former armed forces personnel who face persecution by foreign governments and organisations for doing their duty to safeguard Sri Lankas national security.

The ministry said it takes note of the Press Release dated 24th March 2025, issued by the UK, Foreign Commonwealth  Development Office (FCDO) entitled UK Sanctions for Human Rights Violations and Abuses during the Sri Lankan Civil War. As stated in the press release, the UK government has imposed sanctions on four individuals, three of whom are former military commanders of the Sri Lankan armed forces. Sri Lankas foreign ministry said it is also noted that the UK FCDO Press Release refers to a commitment made during the election campaign to ensure those responsible are not allowed impunity. In this regard, the Ministry said it wishes to underline that this is a unilateral action taken by the UK government which involves an asset freeze and travel ban on the individuals concerned. Such unilateral actions by countries do not assist but serve to complicate the national reconciliation process underway in Sri Lanka, the ministry said in the statement. It further said that the government is in the process of strengthening domestic mechanisms on accountability and reconciliation and that any past human rights violations should be dealt with through domestic accountability mechanisms. The statement further said that the position of the Government of Sri Lanka was conveyed by Foreign Minister Vijitha Herath to the British High Commissioner to Sri Lanka, Andrew Patrick, today at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Foreign Employment and Tourism.",

        "date": "March 26, 2025 09:03 pm",
        "content": "The death toll in the wildfires raging across South Koreas southeastern region rose to 24 and the pilot of a firefighting helicopter was killed when the aircraft crashed on Wednesday, as the country battles some of its worst forest fires in decades. The deadly wildfires have spread rapidly and forced more than 27,000 people from their homes, the government said. The blazes, fuelled by strong winds and dry weather, have razed entire neighbourhoods, closed schools and forced authorities to transfer hundreds of inmates from prisons. We are deploying all available personnel and equipment in response to the worst wildfires ever but the situation is not good, Acting President Han Duck-soo said, adding that the U.S. military in Korea was also assisting. The Korea Forest Service said 24 people had been confirmed dead in the fires. It did not give a breakdown, but earlier the Safety Ministry said 14 people had died in Uiseong county, and four other deaths were linked to a blaze in Sancheong county, Many of the dead were older people in their 60s and 70s, said Son Chang-ho, a local police official. The Forest Service also said one of its fire-fighting helicopters crashed while trying to extinguish a blaze and the pilot was killed. South Korea relies on helicopters to tackle forest fires because of its mountainous terrain and the incident led to the brief grounding of the fleet. The Uiseong fire, only 68 contained and exacerbated by gusty winds, showed unimaginable scale and speed, said Lee Byung-doo, a forest disaster expert at the National Institute of Forest Science. Climate change is projected to make wildfires more frequent globally, Lee said, citing the unusual timing of wildfires that ravaged part of Los Angeles in January and a recent wildfire in northeast Japan. We have to admit large-scale wildfires are going to increase and for that we need more resources and trained manpower, he told Reuters. The Korea Forest Service has been facing technical issues with its fleet of 48 Russian helicopters. Eight have been out of operation since last year because sanctions related to the Ukraine war mean it cannot import parts, a Democratic Party lawmaker said in October. On Wednesday, an eyewitness said the Forest Service helicopter started making a strange sound before plunging to the ground. It completely exploded and I couldnt even tell which parts were the propellers, Kim Jin-han, 63, told Reuters. Video footage from the scene showed what appeared to be smoking debris scattered over a hillside. The cause of the accident was being investigated, authorities said. The weather agency has forecast rain across South Korea on Thursday, though only between 5 to 10 mm was expected in fire-hit areas. More than 10,000 firefighters were being deployed in four separate areas on Wednesday, including hundreds of police officers and military units, while 87 helicopters were being used, the Safety Ministry said. Kim Jong-gun, a Forest Service spokesperson, said it planned to secure more wildfire-fighting helicopters, responding to criticism about a lack of equipment and helicopters. The blazes broke out on Saturday and were threatening several UNESCO World Heritage sites - Hahoe Village and the Byeongsan Confucian Academy - in Andong city on Wednesday, a city official said, as authorities sprayed fire retardants to try to protect them. The flames had already burnt down Goun Temple, which was built in 681. The government has designated the affected areas as special disaster zones, and said the fires had damaged more than 15,000 hectares (37,065 acres). Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "date": "March 26, 2025 09:44 pm",
        "content": "Sri Lankas central bank governor said monetary policy is appropriate right now, as the South Asian nations economy and inflation are moving in line with their goals. The Central Bank of Sri Lanka held the overnight policy rate at 8 for the second straight meeting this year on Wednesday. The move was in line with the forecast of most of the economists surveyed by Bloomberg. The monetary policy is transmitting into the economy nicely and inflation will come back into positive territory from the second half of the year, Governor P. Nandalal Weerasinghe told Bloomberg TVs Haslinda Amin in an interview on Wednesday. So we thought this is the right, appropriate policy stance for the time being. Sri Lankas economy expanded 5 last year, bouncing from a contraction of 2.3 in 2023, and is expected to sustain the pace in the current year. However, the monetary authority will closely monitor the risks from the possible impact of volatile commodity prices and US President Donald Trumps tariffs, the governor said. A 3 billion bailout from the International Monetary Fund has helped in stabilizing Sri Lankas cash-strapped economy. Since the historic default in 2022, authorities have raised taxes and unveiled measures to keep up with the conditions of the lenders loan program. The country needs to increase energy prices and meet fiscal parameters for further aid, the IMF recently said. The country will have to stay the course to meet the revenue-based fiscal consolidation targets and deliver on the promised governance reforms, Weerasinghe said. Theres a lot of confidence and assurance from the administration that theyll move in the same direction, he said. What Bloomberg Economics Says The policy rate is at an appropriate level, based on our estimates of inflation and the output gap. Any easing beyond this point could cause the economy to overheat  leading to an undesirable jump in imports which would pressure FX reserves and hit the rupee. We doubt the central bank will want to risk those events. Ankur Shukla, economist Sri Lanka secured about 334 million in loans from the IMF on Feb 28. The nation is also in the process of signing debt restructuring agreements with bilateral partners in the official creditor committee such as India and members of the Paris club, the governor said.

        "date": "March 26, 2025 10:22 pm",
        "content": "Brazils former President Jair Bolsonaro will stand trial for allegedly attempting to stage a coup against current president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, after a ruling from the countrys top court. The Supreme Courts five-member panel voted unanimously in favour of the trial going ahead. Bolsonaro, 70, denies the charges and says he is the victim of political persecution aimed at preventing him from running for president in 2026. The trial could go ahead as early as this year. If found guilty, Bolsonaro could face years in prison. The panel was tasked with determining whether there was enough evidence to put Bolsonaro on trial. The first to cast his vote on Wednesday was the judge heading the panel, Alexandre de Moraes. He recommended that Bolsonaro, as well as seven other former government officials described by the attorney-general as co-conspirators, stand trial over the events which led up to the storming of government buildings by his supporters on 8 January 2023. The seven men accused of being co-conspirators are:  Alexandre Ramagem, former spy chief  Adm Almir Garnier Santos, former navy commander  Anderson Torres, former security minister  Gen Augusto Heleno, former minister for institutional security  Mauro Cid, Bolsonaros former assistant  Gen Walter Braga Netto, former defence minister  Gen Paulo Sérgio Nogueira de Oliveira former defence minister The other justices also voted in favour of Bolsonaro and the seven others going on trial. Bolsonaro, a former army captain and admirer of US President Donald Trump, governed Brazil from January 2019 to December 2022. He narrowly lost a presidential election run-off in October 2022 to his left-wing rival, Lula. Bolsonaro never publicly acknowledged his defeat. Many of his supporters spent weeks camping outside army barracks in an attempt to convince the military to prevent Lula from being sworn in as president as scheduled on 1 January 2023. A week after Lulas inauguration, on 8 January 2023, thousands of Bolsonaro supporters stormed government buildings in the capital, Brasilia, in what federal investigators say was an attempted coup. Parts of the buildings were ransacked and police arrested 1,500 people. Bolsonaro was in the United States at the time and has always denied any links to the rioters. A federal police investigation into the riots and the events leading up to them was launched. The investigators said they had found evidence that there was a criminal organisation which had acted in a coordinated manner to keep then-President Bolsonaro in power. Their 884-page report, which was unsealed in November 2024, alleged that then-President Jair Messias Bolsonaro planned, acted and was directly and effectively aware of the actions of the criminal organisation aiming to launch a coup detat and eliminate the democratic rule of law. Brazils Attorney-General, Paulo Gonet, went even further in his report published last month, in which he accused Bolsonaro of not just being aware but of leading the criminal organisation that he says sought to overthrow Lula. According to Gonets report, the alleged plot included a plan to poison Lula and shoot dead Alexandre de Moraes - the Supreme Court justice who headed the panel which has now decided that the case should proceed to trial. Bolsonaro has always denied the allegations which he says are politically motivated and designed to stop him from running for president again. While he is already barred from running for public office until 2030 for falsely claiming that Brazils voting system was vulnerable to fraud, he had declared his intention to fight that ban so he could run for a second term in 2026. However, Wednesdays decision by the Supreme Court has placed a very high hurdle in his way to a possible candidacy. Source: BBC --Agencies",

        "content": "The Governor of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka Dr. Nandalal Weerasinghe says it will take at least two years for Sri Lanka to reach a real GDP value similar to that of 2018. Speaking at the CBSLs Monetary Policy briefing on Wednesday (26), the Governor further said this years economic growth will depend on policies implemented within the year, mainly fiscal and structural policies. Dr. Weerasinghe, who further clarified that the negative inflation is temporary, noted that it is mainly due to repeated reductions in electricity tariffs and fuel prices, not because of volatility in demand and supply or monetary policy. Deflationary conditions are expected to gradually ease from March 2025, with inflation projected to turn positive by mid-2025, he added. He mentioned that therefore, the Monetary Policy Board has decided to keep the Overnight Policy Rate at 8. We see that other interest rates are also coming down to favorable, more normal levels. With that, we observed 5 economic growth last year, showing an expansion in the economy that had been contracting for two consecutive years. We expect this trend to continue, Dr. Weerasinghe highlighted. When asked whether the private sector credit being reported at Rs. 105 billion in February 2025 is due to the demand for vehicle imports, the CBSL Chief said, We do not see such a relationship. So far, only around USD 200 million worth of Letters of Credit have been opened.

Furthermore, HRW, an International Non-Governmental Organisation, claimed that the United Kingdom government has advanced accountability in Sri Lanka by imposing sanctions on four men implicated in atrocities during the countrys civil war.

        "content": "According to data released by the Tea Board of India, India has exported 254 million kg of tea in 2024, thus becoming the second-highest exporter in the world. While Kenya retained the first spot in global tea exports, India surpassed Sri Lanka to take the second spot. Kenya exported over 500 Mkg of tea in 2024. In 2023, India and Sri Lanka were neck-in-neck in tea exports with around 231 Mkg, but in 2024 Indiaovertook the island nation with 24 Mkg more exports. Indias 2024 figures were also its second-best export margins behind 2018 when it exported around 256 Mkg of tea. Indias 2024 tea exports amounted to Rs 7,112 crore. While Indias export figures hovered around 200-225 Mkg for the last several years, barring 2018, this impressive growth has provided the tea industry with the hope to touch the 300-Mkg mark by 2030. India, on average, produces 1,400 Mkg of tea every year. The bulk of the export has come from the orthodox segment, the growth of which has been supported by various schemes launched by the Union and state governments in recent times. With the favourable export policy by the Centre and support by the state governments, the industry is hopeful of increasing its export basket in the years to come, said Prabir Kumar Bhattacharjee, secretary general of the Tea Association of India.

        "date": "March 27, 2025 10:01 am",
        "content": "U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday unveiled a 25 tariff on imported cars and light trucks starting next week, widening the global trade war he kicked off upon regaining the White House this year in a move auto industry experts expect will drive up prices and stymie production. What were going to be doing is a 25 tariff for all cars that are not made in the United States, Trump said at an event in the Oval Office. Trump, who sees tariffs as a tool to raise revenue to offset his promised tax cuts and to revive a long-declining U.S. industrial base, said collections would begin on April 3, the day after he plans to announce reciprocal tariffs aimed at the countries responsible for the bulk of the U.S. trade deficit. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen described the move as bad for businesses, worse for consumers, while Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney labeled it a direct attack on Canadian workers. We will defend our workers, we will defend our companies, we will defend our country, and we will defend it together, Carney told reporters in Ottawa. The United Auto Workers, long-standing critics of free trade agreements it says have destroyed American jobs, lauded it. These tariffs are a major step in the right direction for autoworkers and blue-collar communities across the country, and it is now on the automakers, from the Big Three to Volkswagen and beyond, to bring back good union jobs to the U.S., UAW President Shawn Fain said in a statement. Shares of automakers fell in after-hours trading and U.S. equity index futures slid, indicating stocks were headed for a lower open on Thursday. The legal basis for the action is a 2019 national security investigation under Section 232 of the Trade Act of 1962 into auto imports conducted by Trumps first administration. That probe found that auto imports impair U.S. national security, but at the time Trump did not take action to impose tariffs. In an indication of the hastiness with which the new levies are being imposed, Trumps directive included temporary exemptions for auto parts while government officials sort through the complexities of turning his proclamation into practice. It exempts for now, for instance, automotive parts that are compliant with the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) on trade that Trump negotiated during his first term. The agreement allows for largely duty-free trade between the U.S. and its two largest trading partners. USMCA-compliant automobile parts will remain tariff-free until the Secretary of Commerce, in consultation with U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), establishes a process to apply tariffs to their non-U.S. content, White House principal deputy press secretary Harrison Fields said on X. It further exempts until May 3 all other auto parts imports. Brad Setser, a former U.S. Treasury official now with the Council on Foreign Relations, said some 4 million cars from Canada and Mexico now faced 25 or more tariffs, which would likely drive up prices and dampen U.S. car sales for a while. He said the tariffs were a clear violation of USMCA and also raised questions about South Koreas free trade agreement. The economic impact could be significant, he said, noting that U.S. imports of finished vehicles are close to a percentage point of U.S. gross domestic product. The U.S. imported 474 billion worth of automotive products in 2024, including passenger cars worth 220 billion. Mexico, Japan, South Korea, Canada and Germany, all close U.S. allies, were the biggest suppliers. Stocks Fall Ahead of Trumps announcement, shares of U.S.-listed automakers fell on concerns that tariffs would send shock waves through a global auto industry that is already reeling from uncertainty caused by Trumps rapid-fire tariff threats and occasional reversals. Trump on Wednesday said auto tariffs could be net neutral for Tesla, the electric car company that is led by Elon Musk, who is also spearheading a government cost-cutting effort. Musk later posted on X that Tesla would not be unscathed. The tariff impact on Tesla is still significant, he wrote. The U.S. stock market also closed lower on worries over tariffs, which have dogged investors for much of the last month. The benchmark SP 500 Index fell 1.1 ahead of the press conference, and is down more than 4 so far in March for its worst monthly performance in nearly a year. Since taking office on January 20, Trump has announced and delayed tariffs on Canada and Mexico for what he alleges is their role in allowing the opioid fentanyl into the U.S.; set import taxes on goods from China for the same reason; launched hefty duties on imports of steel and aluminum; and has repeatedly touted his plans to announce global reciprocal tariffs on April 2. Regarding the coming April 2 announcement, Trump indicated the measures may not be the like-for-like levies he has been pledging to impose. Were going to make it very lenient, Trump said. I think people will be very surprised. Itll be, in many cases, less than the tariff theyve been charging (the U.S.) for decades. The new vehicle levies were expected to drive costs of cars higher for consumers by thousands of dollars, hitting new vehicle sales and resulting in job losses, since the U.S. automotive industry relies heavily on imported parts, according to the Center for Automotive Research. At a time when cost is the number one concern for American car buyers, U.S. automakers are working to provide a range of affordable vehicles for consumers, Jennifer Safavian, president and CEO of Autos Drive America, a trade group representing foreign automakers, said in a statement. The tariffs imposed today will make it more expensive to produce and sell cars in the United States, ultimately leading to higher prices, fewer options for consumers, and fewer manufacturing jobs in the U.S. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "content": "Ever found yourself speechless in the presence of overwhelming cuteness, like your baby nephew or the cat video you saw on Instagram? Theres now a word for it: gigil. Gigil (pronounced ghee-gill) is part of a list of untranslatable words, or those that do not have English equivalents, that have been added to the Oxford English Dictionary.. Taken from the Philippines Tagalog language, gigil is a feeling so intense that it gives us the irresistible urge to tightly clench our hands, grit our teeth, and pinch or squeeze whomever or whatever it is we find so adorable. Alamak, a colloquial exclamation used to convey surprise or outrage in Singapore and Malaysia, also made the list. Wouldnt it be useful for English speakers to have a specific word for sunlight dappling through leaves... Or a word for the action of sitting outside enjoying a beer? OED said in its latest update. People who speak English alongside other languages fill lexical gaps by borrowing the untranslatable word from another language. When they do this often enough, the borrowed word becomes part of their vocabulary, OED said. The majority of newly-added words from Singapore and Malaysia are names of dishes, a testament to the nations obsessions with food. These include kaya toast, a popular breakfast option of toasted bread slathered with a jam made from coconut milk, eggs, sugar and pandan leaves; fish head curry, a dish combining Chinese and South Indian influences, where a large fish head is cooked in a tamarind-based curry; and steamboat, a dish of thinly-sliced meat and vegetables cooked in a broth kept simmering in a heated pot. All this talk of food might inspire one to get a takeaway, or to tapau, OED said, referring to another new word which originated from Mandarin and the Cantonese dialect, meaning to package, or wrap up, food to take away. Apart from gigil, the newly-added Philippine words include the national pastime of videoke, the local version of karaoke which includes a scoring system, and salakot, a wide-brimmed, lightweight hat often used by farmers. Other Philippine additions include what the OED calls idiosyncratic uses of existing English words, such as terror, sometimes used to describe a teacher who is strict, harsh, or demanding. The OED contains more than 600,000 words, making it one of the most comprehensive dictionaries in the English-speaking world. Its editors consider thousands of new word suggestions each year. These come from a variety of sources, including its editors own reading, crowdsourcing appeals, and analysis of language databases. Words and phrases from South Africa and Ireland were also part of OEDs latest update. Source: BBC --Agencies",

        "date": "March 27, 2025 03:34 pm",
        "content": "Sri Lankas investment environment needs diversification to provide better opportunities for both the public and corporations, Governor of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka Dr. Nandalal Weerasinghe stated while addressing the Invest Sri Lanka forum held in Colombo today (27). Highlighting the limited investment options available to the general public within the country, he emphasized the need for expanding capital markets and allowing state-owned enterprises (SOEs) to raise funds through public ownership. Many Sri Lankans invest their savings in fixed deposits or banking instruments because there arent enough diverse investment opportunities, the Governor said, adding that because there is a lack of investment opportunities in diverse instruments, people fall victim to scams, pyramid schemes, and unauthorized financial operations and people lose their money. He stressed that relying solely on interest income is not sustainable in the long run, stating If we look at Sri Lankan investors or the general public, what are the investment opportunities for the general public available in Sri Lanka, still a lot of people, their savings, they invest in fixed deposits or the banking sector. The reason is because they dont have that much of investment opportunities. This is another important element, for the people to have been offered with opportunity to invest their savings in diverse investment opportunities. The senior citizens, deposit their savings and try to live with the interest income. That is not sustainable. Under this kind of a monetary policy cycle market interest rates cannot be overly high, can never be double digit if we maintain inflation at 5. We have to have a situation where people get used to relatively low banking interest rates, he added. Furthermore, he mentioned: In this situation, no one will be able to live out of interest income out of their savings, unless they have a huge amount of savings in a bank. This is where it is important to provide this kind of financial instruments. According to the CBSL Governor, one solution is strengthening the government securities market and fostering corporate ventures. Capital markets and regulated financial instruments provide opportunities for better returns. Its crucial to ensure financial stability and predictability while enabling capital formation, he noted. On state-owned enterprises, Dr. Weerasinghe underscored the importance of public investment. The government is not in a position to inject more taxpayer money into SOE expansion, and even banks have limited capacity to finance such growth. The best approach is to allow SOEs to raise capital through the stock market while maintaining a level of state ownership, he said. The government has signaled its willingness to shift towards public ownership while retaining strategic control. Offering that part to public is the right move in my view. Thats where you will have opportunities and corporations both public and private will have opportunities to raise capital with the stability in place, with predictability in place, but capital is where that capital formation is important, the CBSL chief stated.",

        "date": "March 27, 2025 05:20 pm",
        "content": "Badulla District MP Chamara Sampath Dassanayake has been remanded until April 01 in connection with another bribery allegation, Ada Derana reporter said. The New Democratic Front (NDF) MP, who was arrested by the Bribery Commission earlier today in connection with three separate bribery cases, was granted bail by the Colombo Magistrates Court over one of the cases. However, he has been ordered to be remanded until April 01 with regard to another bribery case against him. During his tenure as the Chief Minister of Uva Province in 2016, Mr. Dassanayake had allegedly requested money from three state banks, claiming to provide school bags for preschool children in the Uva Province. Two banks had provided Rs. 1 million and Rs. 2.5 million, respectively, and it is alleged that he had credited these funds to his personal foundations bank account. However, when the money was requested from the third bank, and that bank had refused to provide the money, Mr. Dassanayake had proceeded to withdraw the fixed deposits belonging to the Uva Provincial Council from that bank. The Bribery Commission has filed a case before the court, stating that the government has incurred a loss of Rs. 17.3 million due to this decision. After considering the relevant facts presented, the court ordered MP Chamara Sampath Dassanayake to be remanded in custody for the third charge, although he was granted bail for the first two charges, Ada Derana reporter said. Accordingly, the court ordered the release of Mr. Dassanayake on a cash bail of Rs. 50,000 and two sureties of Rs. 5 million each over the first two charges while he was ordered remanded until April 1 over the third charge.",

        "date": "March 27, 2025 06:05 pm",
        "content": "Six people died and nine were injured when a tourist submarine carrying 45 passengers sank off the Egyptian coast Thursday, said provincial officials. They were speaking on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief the media. Emergency crews rescued 29 people from the sinking off one of the beaches in the tourist promenade area in the Red Sea resort of Hurghada. In addition to crew members, there were 45 passengers on board, all of them Russian and some of them minors, Russian consular officials in Hurghada said. It is unclear how many crew members were on board. The submarine, which belonged to the Sindbad hotel in Hurghada, was out on a regular tour to view coral reefs. It sailed off at around 10 a.m. Thursday and sank when it was about 1 kilometer (approximately half a mile) from the shore. Those rescued were taken to hospitals and are in a stable condition, according to the Russian consulate. It was not immediately clear what caused the submarine to sink. The vessel, which was operated by a Hurghada-based company called Sindbad Submarines, has 44 passenger seats, two pilot seats, and a round viewing window for each passenger, according to the company website. In November, a tourist yacht sank in the Red Sea after warnings of rough waters, Egyptian officials said. At least four people drowned, while 33 were rescued. Tourism is an important sector of Egypts economy but many tourist companies have stopped or limited traveling on the Red Sea due to the dangers from conflicts in the region.

Replying to supplementaries during question hour, Jaishankar said India is trying to engage with Sri Lanka to take a humanitarian approach to the issue, even as the central government is finding long-term ways, including installing transponders on fishing boats, to ensure that such a situation does not recur. Jaishankar said the decisions which were taken in 1974 and 1976 are today the root cause of the situation the country is facing. Right now the situation is that till yesterday there were 86 Indian fishermen in Sri Lankan custody. Today, one more trawler has been apprehended and so 11 more fishermen. All together, 97 of them are in custody. Eighty three are serving sentences, three are awaiting trial and 11 have been apprehended today, he informed the Upper House. He said among those who are today serving sentences, many of them are owners of boats or they are repeat offenders and that has been the challenge in dealing with the issue. Jaishankar said that in a way our government has inherited a problem. Source: PTI --Agencies",

        "date": "March 27, 2025 09:23 pm",
        "content": "During Prime Minister Narendra Modis upcoming Sri Lanka visit, key focus will be on infrastructure development, with railway projects expected to be inaugurated in Anuradhapura, including track upgradation, signalling and launch of NTPC Sampur Solar Project. The solar power project in Sampur, located in the Trincomalee district of eastern Sri Lanka is a joint venture between Indias National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) and Sri Lankas Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB). This initiative complements other renewable energy efforts in Sri Lanka, including India supporting a project to install rooftop solar systems across 5,000 religious institutions in Sri Lanka, spanning all nine provinces and 25 districts worth 17 million. The handover of solar panels and equipment to sites like a Buddhist temple in Hokandara, Sri Aanjaneyar Temple, St. Anthonys Church, and Mutwal Jumma Mosque occurred in October 2024, involving representatives from the Indian High Commission, Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB), and Sri Lanka Sustainable Energy Authority. PM Modi is expected to be in Sri Lanka from 4th to 6th April, his 4th visit to the country since 2014. The Indian leader has been to Sri Lanka in 2015, 2017 and 2019. He is the first foreign head of the government to be hosted by Sri Lankan President Anura Kumara Dissanayake. During the conversation, a key focus will be Indias support to Sri Lankas debt restructuring. In early 2023, India became the first country to officially back Sri Lankas debt restructuring plan, conveying its support to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) as Sri Lanka sought a 2.9 billion bailout. Between January and July 2022, New Delhi provided approximately 4 billion in rapid assistance, including credit lines, currency swaps, and deferred import payments, to help Sri Lanka cope with severe foreign exchange shortages and import essential goods. In June 2024, India, alongside France and Japan as part of the Official Creditors Committee (OCC), agreed to a broader debt restructuring deal covering 5.8 billion of Sri Lankas bilateral debt. Another key focus during the visit will be on connectivity, with expected conversation on India, Sri Lanka power grid connectivity. The plan involves establishing a high-voltage direct current (HVDC) transmission link between Madurai in southern India (Tamil Nadu) and Anuradhapura in central Sri Lanka. The project is being developed by the Power Grid Corporation of India Limited (PGCIL) and the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) and can help Sri Lanka save a lot of money, reduce reliance on expensive thermal power. Also on the anvil, plans to take forward the India Sri Lanka oil pipeline, in which UAE is playing an important role. The project is intended to transport various energy products, such as oil and possibly gas, to meet Sri Lankas energy needs, with special focus on connectivity. PM Modi travels to Rameswaram in Tamil Nadu from Sri Lanka, on 6th April, in what is seen as a symbolic message on the closeness between the 2 countries. On 6th April, which is Ram Navmi, PM Modi will pray at the Sri Arulmigu Ramanathaswamy Temple, which is one of the 12 Jyotirlinga temples. During Sri Lanka, the PM could travel to the Indian Peace Keeping Force (IPKF) Memorial in the country. The memorial is a war monument dedicated to the Indian soldiers who lost their lives during the peacekeeping mission in Sri Lanka between 1987 and 1990. Another key announcement also expected on capacity building of Sri Lankan civil servants. Source: WION --Agencies",

        "content": "U.S. President Donald Trump said on Thursday that larger tariffs could be placed on the European Union and Canada if they both work together to do economic harm to the USA. If the European Union works with Canada in order to do economic harm to the USA, large scale tariffs, far larger than currently planned, will be placed on them both in order to protect the best friend that each of those two countries has ever had, he said in a post on Truth Social. On Wednesday, Trump unveiled a 25 tariff on imported vehicles, expanding a global trade war and prompting criticism and threats of retaliation from affected U.S. allies. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen described the move as bad for businesses, worse for consumers, while Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney labeled the tariffs a direct attack on Canadian workers and said retaliatory measures were being considered. The new levies on cars and light trucks will take effect on April 3, the day after Trump plans to announce reciprocal tariffs aimed at the countries responsible for the bulk of the U.S. trade deficit. They come on top of duties already introduced on steel and aluminum, and on goods from Mexico, Canada and China. The EU has said it will delay its first set of counter-measures to mid-April, including a 50 tariff on U.S. bourbon. In response, Trump threatened to slap a 200 tariff on all wines and other alcoholic products from the EU if the bloc went ahead with this. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

Karannagoda claimed that the sanctions are not based on any transparent investigation or legal proceedings, but reflect the selective application of international pressure, targeting those who played key roles in Sri Lankas military victory. He added that the same foreign entities that now impose restrictions did nothing while Sri Lanka was under siege by terrorists and ignored atrocities committed by the LTTE. Meanwhile, commenting on the matter, Minister of Health and Media Dr. Nalinda Jayatissa stated that the government has already announced their decision clearly and firmly as a country and that however, the opposition is always looking for a political slogan to fight against.

His engagements for Thursday afternoon and Friday were canceled. His majesty has now returned to Clarence House and as a precautionary measure, acting on medical advice, tomorrows diary program will also be rescheduled, the palace said. His majesty would like to send his apologies to all those who may be inconvenienced or disappointed as a result. The kings health has been closely watched ever since early last year when he announced that he had been diagnosed with an undisclosed form of cancer. Charles, 76, stepped away from public duties for about three months but continued fulfilling state duties, such as reviewing government papers and meeting with the prime minister. Charles cancer diagnosis has heaped pressure on the British monarchy, which is still evolving after the 70-year reign of the late Queen Elizabeth II. When he succeeded his mother in September 2022, Charles task was to demonstrate that the 1,000-year-old institution remains relevant in a modern nation whose citizens come from all corners of the globe. But this task takes much time and energy. Although the duties of a constitutional monarch are largely ceremonial, the royal whirl can be exhausting. Besides the occasional procession in full royal regalia, there are meetings with political leaders, dedication ceremonies and events honoring the accomplishments of British citizens. That added up to 161 days of royal engagements during Charless first year on the throne. Charles illness came as his daughter-in-law, Kate, the Princess of Wales, was also diagnosed with cancer. Kate, the wife of Prince William, took more than six months off before returning to public duties in late September. Source: AP --Agencies",

        "content": "The International Monetary Fund (IMF) says that the economic recovery is gaining momentum in Sri Lanka and that yet, the economy still remains vulnerable, making it critical that the reform momentum be sustained to ensure that macroeconomic stability and debt sustainability are durably achieved. Speaking during the IMFs weekly press briefing, IMF Spokesperson Julie Kozack stated that the fourth tranche of 334 million was made available to Sri Lanka to support its economic policies and reforms, immediately after the Executive Board approved the Third Review. On Friday, February 28th, the IMF Executive Board approved the Third Review under the EFF (Extended Fund Facility) arrangement for Sri Lanka. And this provided the country with immediate access to 334 million of support. So, yes, once the Board approved that Third Review, the 334 million was made available to Sri Lanka to support its economic policies and reforms. And with this 334 million, it brings total financial support from the IMF to Sri Lanka to 1.34 billion, Kozack confirmed. Furthermore, the IMF Spokesperson said that reforms in Sri Lanka are bearing fruit and that the economic recovery is gaining momentum. She noted that inflation remains low in Sri Lanka, revenue collection on the fiscal side is improving, and international reserves are continuing to accumulate. Economic growth reached 5 percent in 2024, and that was after two years of economic contraction, she added, highlighting that the IMF do expect the recovery to continue in 2025 in Sri Lanka. These are all very positive developments for Sri Lanka and for the people of Sri Lanka, Kozack expressed. Meanwhile, the IMF Spokesperson also mentioned: All of this said, the economy still does remain vulnerable, and therefore it is critical that the reform momentum be sustained to ensure that macroeconomic stability and debt sustainability are durably achieved. In response to a question raised by a journalist on the IMFs take on the proposal to list Sri Lankas State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) in the Colombo Stock Exchange given that the program also calls for extensive reforms in SEOs, Kozack denied a comment, stating, I dont have anything for you on that regarding the SOEs, but well come back to you bilaterally.",

        "content": "Former Sri Lankan cricketer and international umpire Kumara Dharmasena emphasizes that cricketers must comply with the countrys tax laws, stating that if taxes are required, players should adhere to legal obligations. Sharing his views on the matter, Dharmasena stated, I personally believe that if there is a law in the country, we must respect it. If we are required to pay taxes, we should do so as law-abiding citizens. He added that while he is unaware of the exact earnings of current cricketers, he personally received a good salary during his playing days and continues to do so as an umpire. I think cricket provides a decent livelihood, he remarked. His comments come in the wake of the ongoing legal battle involving Sri Lankas ODI and Test captains, Charith Asalanka and Dhananjaya de Silva. The two cricketers have filed a petition seeking an exemption from paying withholding tax, challenging the Inland Revenue Departments decision to classify national players as employees of Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC). The petition is scheduled to be heard today (March 28) to review the facts of the case.",

        "title": "Sundance Film Festival to relocate to Boulder, Colorado",
        "date": "March 28, 2025 03:23 pm",
        "content": "After a yearlong search, the Sundance Film Festival announced Thursday that its new home will be Boulder, Colorado, keeping Sundance in the mountains but moving it out of Park City, the Utah ski town that had for decades provided the premier independent film gathering its picturesque snowy backdrop. Organizers said that after 40 years in the mountains, the festival had outgrown Park City, and lacked the necessary theaters or affordable housing to continue hosting what has become one of North Americas most sprawling movie events. Sundance had narrowed down the options to Salt Lake City (with a smaller presence in Park City), Cincinnati and Boulder. Boulder emerged as their choice due to its close proximity to nature, its small-town charm and an engaged community that, organizer said, provides Sundance the ideal setting for its future. Boulder is a tech town, its a college town, its an arts town, and its a mountain town, Amanda Kelso, acting chief executive of the Sundance Institute, said in an interview Thursday from Boulder. At 100,000 people, a larger town than Park City, it gives us the space to expand. Kelso, Sundance Institute board chair Ebs Burnough and Eugene Hernandez, director of the festival and head of programming, spoke shortly before announcing the festivals move. Local officials, who helped lure Sundance with 34 million in tax credits over 10 years, applauded the decision. Here in our state we celebrate the arts and film industry as a key economic driver, job creator and important contributor to our thriving culture, Colorado Gov. Jared Polis, a Democrat, said in a statement. Utah Gov. Spencer Cox, a Republican, said Thursday that Sundance will come to regret leaving Utah. As Ive said from the beginning, we wanted Sundance to stay, Cox said in a statement. We made that clear to their leadership and put together a highly competitive package. Ultimately, this decision is theirs to make, but I believe its a mistake and that, one day, theyll realize they left behind not just a place, but their heritage. A change endorsed by Sundance founder Robert Redford A shift from Park City to Boulder means Sundance stays in the mountains but trades a luxury ski resort enclave for a growing, outdoorsy small city. The mile-high Colorado city set in the foothills of the Rockies also maintains a sense of surrounding nature  something organizers stressed as a major factor in their decision. Boulders four-block pedestrian mall on Pearl Street, with nearby theaters, could provide a similar sense of central hub like Park Citys Main Street. The Macky Auditorium, on the University of Colorado campus, is expected to be a central stage for Sundance. The Sundance Institute was founded in 1981 by Robert Redford, who sought a location far from Hollywood to foster independent voices in film. In 1984, the institute took over the Sundance Film Festival, but the nonprofits mission of helping young filmmakers grow through labs and workshops  Redfords real passion  continued year-round away from the festival. The 88-year-old Redford, who attended the University of Colorado in Boulder in his youth, gave the move his blessing. Words cannot express the sincere gratitude I have for Park City, the state of Utah, and all those in the Utah community that have helped to build the organization, Redford said in a statement. What weve created is remarkably special and defining. As change is inevitable, we must always evolve and grow, which has been at the core of our survival. How Sundance chose its new home The festival made ethos and equity values one of its criteria, prompting many to wonder how much local politics would influence the choice by Sundance, which emphasizes inclusivity. Later Thursday, Cox said he was allowing a first-in-the-nation policy banning certain flag displays at schools and government buildings, including the LGBTQ pride flag, to become law without his signature. The bills Republican sponsor, state Sen. Trevor Lee, said in response to the Sundance news that it promoted filth and would not be missed. Organizers said Boulders welcoming environment aligns with the ethos of Sundance. This process started 18 months ago and weve been in Utah for 40 years. So politics really didnt guide the process, Burnough said Thursday. It was really and truly about evolution. Thats where it landed. We didnt constantly spend time examining what bill was going forward or may or may not be signed. With its current contract expiration date looming, the hunt for a new host city began in earnest in April 2024. The initial group of six contenders also included Atlanta, Louisville, Kentucky, and Santa Fe, New Mexico. What Sundance has meant for Park City, and the film world Before packing up, Sundance will have one last edition in Park City in January 2026. The Sundance Film Festival will be the Sundance Film Festival wherever we go. Whats consistent is our mission, said Hernandez. This is a festival of global discovery. Whats exciting about Boulder is this is a place we can build. Over the years, Sundance in Park City swelled into a premier marketplace for American film, drawing studio executives and parka-wearing celebrities into the Wasatch mountains every January. It helped launch countless filmmakers over the years, from Steven Soderbergh (Sex, Lies and Videotape) to Ryan Coogler (Fruitvale Station). Sundance scored its first best picture winner with CODA in 2022. Sundance meant big business for Utah and Park City. In 2024, the festival had some 72,840 in-person attendees, 24,200 of whom were coming from out of state. According to the festivals economic impact report, out-of-state visitors spent an estimated 106.4 million in Utah during the festival. Its total economic impact was estimated to be 132 million, with 1,730 jobs for Utah residents. But the festival had also sparred with local ski resorts  Park Citys other major money maker  as festivalgoers filled the hotels and left the slopes virtually empty for two weeks during peak ski season. The festival was a boon to some local businesses, but a hindrance to others. For visitors flying into the 10-day festival, ballooning rental costs increasingly factored into attending. Debbie Gold, a festivalgoer from Florida who got bit by the Sundance bug 20 years ago, said shes not yet sure whether she will continue attending at the new location. Its the end of an era, for me anyway, in Park City, said Gold, whose experiences at Sundance inspired her to get involved with her local Miami Film Festival and some independent film productions. I dont think itll be quite the same in a new place. But between Boulder and Cincinnati, Boulder at least sounds a little enticing because its a cute mountain town. Sundances relocation puts two of the top U.S. film festivals in Colorado. The Telluride Film Festival, held further west in the state, runs in late August. Source: AP --Agencies",

        "date": "March 28, 2025 10:20 pm",
        "content": "It was revealed in the Committee on Public Enterprises (COPE) that a private company named Savorite was issued Waiver of Registration (WoR) certificates to import 38 types of medicines in 2022 without the evaluation of the National Medicines Regulatory Authority (NMRA). The former Secretary to the Ministry of Health also informed the Committee that the former Minister of Health had given instructions to select this private company called Savorite to import medicines in this way. This was disclosed when the Committee on Public Enterprises (COPE) of Parliament met in Parliament on Wednesday (March 26), under the chairmanship of Member of Parliament (Dr.) Nishantha Samaraweera, to examine the Auditor Generals reports for the years 2022, 2023 and 2024 and the current performance of the National Medicines Regulatory Authority, the Department of Communication of Parliament said. The Committee Chair informed the committee that on December 30, 2022, the NMRA had issued Waiver of Registration (WoR) certificates to a private company named Savorite for the import of 38 types of medicines submitted through unsolicited proposals without the evaluation of the NMRA. The Committee Chair said that the NMRA has abdicated its responsibility, stating that the purpose of establishing the NMRA is to ensure the quality, safety and efficacy of those medicines and that it cannot be handed over to the Medical Supplies Sector. Former members of the Board of Directors of the NMRA said that since the import of medicines through a special pathway with prior approval was carried out, the Board of Directors could not grant permission for it without conducting a proper evaluation. Therefore, they said that they did not accept responsibility in this regard. Accordingly, this matter was discussed at length in the committee, and it was revealed that the former Minister of Health had instructed to select a private company called Savorite to import the medicines in short supply for 3 months. Meanwhile, the Committee also discussed at length the Cabinet Memorandum submitted by the former Minister of Health on 26 September 2022. The Committee Chair inquired from the Ministry of Health officials about the fact that a large number of medicines would reach zero levels within the next 3 weeks from the date of submission of the relevant Cabinet Memorandum. The officials who responded said that the information had been added to the Cabinet Memorandum based on the information obtained from the existing database regarding medicines. However, the committee Chair said that it was unacceptable for a large number of medicines to reach zero levels at the same time and that the relevant responsible officials had acted irresponsibly until such a level was reached. The Auditor General, who spoke at the time, stated that the medicines that were ordered and to be received in advance have also been imported, citing that the medicines have reached zero levels. Accordingly, the committee chair instructed the officials to submit a full report to the Committee on who were the officials involved in preparing this Cabinet Memorandum. The Chair further stated that a full report regarding the import of these medicines will be prepared by the Committee and submitted to Parliament, and that necessary action will be taken expeditiously. The Members of Parliament Mano Ganeshan, Nalin Bandara Jayamaha, S. M. Marikkar, Chaminda Wijesiri, Attorney-at-Law Nilanthi Kottahachchi, Chandima Hettiarachchi, Asitha Niroshana Egoda Vithana, Kosala Nuwan Jayaweera, Sudath Balagalla, (Dr.) S.
