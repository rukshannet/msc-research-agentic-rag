The Sungavila-Somawathiya road in the Pulasthipura Police Division has been submerged for approximately two kilometers, starting from the Diggala area near the Somawathi Raja Maha Viharaya. The flooding has occurred due to the rising water levels of the Mahaweli River, caused by heavy rainfall that prevailed since yesterday (13). As a result, traffic movement along the route has been completely disrupted. Police have taken steps to evacuate individuals who had traveled to Somawathi Raja Maha Viharaya by sending them back in the buses they arrived in, from the Welikanda direction. To ensure safety and prevent incidents, police lifeguards have been deployed in the affected area, the police said.",

        "title": "Hamas expected to release 33 hostages in first phase of emerging ceasefire deal, Israeli officials say",
        "date": "January 14, 2025 03:01 pm",
        "content": "Hamas is expected to release 33 hostages during the first phase of an emerging ceasefire agreement being finalized by negotiators in Doha, two Israeli officials said, the first positive sign in months that a truce in the Israel-Hamas war may be in sight. Officials have expressed cautious optimism that a deal could soon be announced to halt 15 months of fighting that has destabilized the Middle East and devastated Gaza, allow for more aid into the besieged Palestinian enclave, and ensure the return of dozens of hostages held by Hamas since its attack on Israel on October 7, 2023. Hamas and its allies still hold 94 of the 251 hostages taken from Israel, including at least 34 of whom are dead, according to the Israeli government. Israel believes that most of the 33 hostages to be released in the first phase of the deal are alive, a senior Israeli official told reporters on Monday, but the bodies of dead captives will also likely be among those released. The first phase would take place over an initial 42-day ceasefire. The senior Israeli official said the parties appear to be on the verge of an agreement and that Israel is prepared to immediately implement the deal once it has been inked. US President Joe Biden expressed similar optimism in a speech Monday focused on foreign policy, saying the United States was pressing hard to close this. The deal we have structured would free the hostages, halt the fighting, provide security to Israel, and allow us to significantly surge humanitarian assistance to the Palestinians who suffered terribly in this war that Hamas started. They have been through hell, Biden said. Meanwhile, President-elect Donald Trump told Newsmax that his understanding is that theres been a handshake and theyre getting it finished. Trumps incoming special envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff previously told reporters he was working alongside Biden administration officials during the negotiations, and hoped to get a temporary ceasefire deal enacted before Trumps inauguration on Monday. A diplomat close to the negotiations told CNN a final round of proximity talks to finalize any issues was scheduled to take place in Doha on Tuesday. The same day, some of the hostages families have been invited to meet Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, according to the Hostages and Missing Families Forum. On Tuesday, protesters formed a human chain outside the Israeli parliament, also known as the Knesset, to demand the release of all remaining hostages held in Gaza. Many held large banners with the names and faces of the captives alongside the words DONT leave me behind! One demonstrator, Shay Dickmann, said a family member held in Gaza had been released in a previous ceasefire and hostage deal in November 2023, while another  her cousin  had been killed while in Hamas captivity in the enclave. From my family, I know how it is when someone comes back alive on a deal, she said. We are not going to let go for any one of them. We want them all back home. And it sounds like there is a chance right now, but we cant let it go until we see them stepping here in Israel. Qadura Fares, the head of the Palestinian Commission for Detainees and Ex-Detainees, told CNN on Monday that he was traveling to Doha to advise negotiators on the list of detainees to be released in the event the deal materializes. The release of the 33 hostages would be the first phase of the deal being finalized. Negotiations to reach the second phase  which is intended to end the war  would begin on the 16th day of the implementation of the deal. Under the latest proposals, Israeli forces would maintain a presence along the Philadelphi Corridor  a narrow strip of land along the Egypt-Gaza border  during the first phase of the agreement, the officials said. The presence of Israeli troops along the corridor previously contributed to sinking a potential deal in September during the last round of negotiations. Israel would also maintain a buffer zone inside Gaza along the border with Israel, the official said, without specifying how wide that zone would be  another subject of contention during the negotiations. A Hamas official told CNN earlier that the group wanted the buffer zone to return to the pre-October 7 size of 300-500 meters (330-545 yards) from the border line, while Israel was requesting 2,000 meters. The current status of the Hamas hostages abducted on October 7 In total, 251 people in Israel were taken on Oct. 7, 2023, and the Israeli government says 94 are still in Gaza as of January 10, 2025. Most of the 157 who have been returned so far were released after a deal was reached with Hamas late last year. The residents of northern Gaza would be allowed to return freely to the north of the strip, but an Israeli official claimed there would be unspecified security arrangements in place. Palestinian prisoners deemed responsible for killing Israelis would not be released into the West Bank, the official said, but rather to the Gaza Strip or abroad following agreements with foreign countries. CNN has reached out to Hamas for comment. A senior Israeli official told reporters on Monday that a breakthrough in the talks came late Sunday night during Israeli intelligence agency Mossad Director David Barneas meeting with the mediators in Doha, Qatar. There is talk of an agreement in the near future  it is impossible to say whether it is a matter of hours or days, the official said. The official said Israel is prepared to quickly implement the agreement, but the deal must first pass both the security cabinet and full government cabinet. The government must also allow time for opponents of the agreement to petition the Supreme Court. We are closer than ever to a deal but mediators in Doha are still awaiting official responses from both sides, said an Arab official briefed on the talks. Speaking to CNN Monday, the former Israeli intelligence official Avi Melamed cautioned that even if a deal were reached, the continued presence of the Israeli military and Hamas in Gaza during the first phase of its implementation could risk reigniting hostilities. That part is very sensitive because it could potentially have the seeds that result in  at some point for whatever the reason  reignition or flares of fighting in Gaza. Its not to say necessarily that that will happen, but its something that could happen and we should take it into consideration, he said. Melamed said that during the first phase of a deal, neither side would want to give up leverage but in the next phase would try to exhaust any kind of leverage cards they have including in the context of military capacities in Gaza. Meanwhile, the Hostages and Missing Families Forum said Monday it remained hopeful but cautious amid the reports of a deal being close. We continue to trust in those working tirelessly to bring our loved ones home, and we will not rest until the last hostage returns, the group said. Israel launched its war on Hamas in Gaza following the attacks of October 7, 2023, in which around 1,200 people were killed and 250 taken hostage. Since then, the Israeli military has killed at least 46,565 Palestinians in Gaza, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health. More than 100,000 have been injured. Source: CNN --Agencies",

        "content": "Sydneys popular Manly Beach and other beaches around the Australian city were closed on Tuesday as authorities investigated marble-sized balls of white and gray debris that had washed on shore, in the latest such mysterious incident in recent months. The Northern Beaches Council said most of the samples identified were marble-sized, though some were larger. It said it was organizing the safe removal of the debris, the makeup and origin of which is unknown. In addition to Manly, officials closed Dee Why, Long Reef, Queenscliff, Freshwater, North and South Curl Curl, North Steyne and North Narrabeen beaches until further notice. Other beaches are being inspected. The closures come at the peak of the Australian summer. The council said it was collecting samples of the debris for testing in close coordination with the Environmental Protection Agency of New South Wales, the state that includes Sydney. The agency advised members of the public not to touch the balls of debris, which are similar in appearance to those that washed up on beaches in the east of the city in October, including the famous Bondi Beach. That debris, which was initially thought to be tar balls, was found to be a combination of decomposed cooking oils, hair and food waste. Source: NBC News --Agencies",

        "date": "January 14, 2025 07:27 pm",
        "content": "Minister of Trade, Commerce and Food Security Wasantha Samarasinghe stated that the current shortage of Red Rice in the market emerged as a result of mismanagement by previous governments, while assuring the public that measures are being taken to address the situation. We understand that red rice is a staple for many, especially during Thai Pongal festival. The shortage has raised concerns, and I want to clarify the reasons behind it, Samarasinghe said. According to the Minister, red rice cultivation has historically been concentrated in areas such as Matara, Galle, Hambantota, and other parts of the Southern and Eastern provinces. In 2024, a total of 277,315 hectares were cultivated across the Yala and Maha seasons, yielding 1.1 million metric tons of paddy. However, due to the poor management of resources and distribution by previous administrations, there is a noticeable scarcity now, the Minister added. The Maha season of 2024 saw a cultivation area of 277,000 hectares, producing approximately 706,000 metric tons of paddy, while the Yala season contributed 403,097 metric tons from a similar cultivated area. Despite these figures, the Minister highlighted that inefficient distribution policies have left the market short of red rice. Looking forward, Minister Samarasinghe provided reassurance about the upcoming Maha season in 2025, where 161,067 hectares have already been cultivated, with an expected yield of 648,200 metric tons. There is no reason for a shortage in 2025, he emphasized. The Minister criticized the previous government for policies that he claimed disrupted the market. He pointed to a pre-election initiative where 20 kilograms of red rice per family were distributed indiscriminately, even to individuals who typically consume white rice. This ill-advised policy created an imbalance in the market. By giving red rice to people unaccustomed to eating it, they inadvertently caused a shortage for those who rely on it, he explained. We have conducted surveys in paddy-growing areas, mills, and warehouses to better understand the situation and prevent future shortages, he concluded.",

        "date": "January 14, 2025 09:35 pm",
        "content": "I have traveled almost all over China, and get impressed by the beauty of the diverse culture, food and friendly people. I also hope that more Chinese tourists will come to my country to experience Sri Lankas scenery and culture, Ruwan Ranasinghe, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs, Foreign Employment and Tourism of Sri Lanka, has told Xinhua. In 2014, Ranasinghe realized his dream of studying in China. Under the Belt and Road Initiative, Ranasinghe won a Chinese government scholarship and went to Sichuan University to pursue a doctorate in tourism management. During his stay in China, Ranasinghe and his tutor promoted the establishment of the International Center for Interdisciplinary Culture Heritage  Tourism Research, SCU-UWU. He also witnessed the increasing preference of Chinese tourists for Sri Lanka. In 2017, China became the second largest source of tourists to Sri Lanka, with more than 260,000 Chinese tourists traveling to Sri Lanka throughout the year. However, with turbulence in Sri Lankas domestic situation and the COVID-19 pandemic, the number of Chinese tourists to Sri Lanka has sharply declined for some time. After the pandemic, Chinese tourists traveling abroad increased significantly. Ranasinghe said that the Sri Lankan government welcomed the return of Chinese tourists. The country hopes to create more convenient conditions for Chinese tourists regarding visas and direct flights, so that Sri Lanka will become one of preferred choices for Chinese tourists. Sri Lanka and China have close economic, diplomatic and cultural exchanges, said Ranasinghe, stressing that high-quality Belt and Road cooperation and major projects between the two countries such as the Colombo Port City and Hambantota Port have provided important impetus for Sri Lankas economic recovery and showcased a strong junction between the two sides. Sri Lankan President Anura Kumara Dissanayake pays a state visit to China from Jan. 14 to Jan. 17. Ranasinghe said that Sri Lanka and China are expected to achieve more results in many aspects including trade and investment, cooperation in key projects, and cultural and tourism exchanges, to promote bilateral ties to a new high. Sri Lanka also has frequent and close cultural exchanges with China in history, Ranasinghe said. Famous Chinese monk Fa Xian and legendary Chinese navigator Zheng He had visited this island. Exchanges between the two peoples and cultures can still establish a solid bond for bilateral relations, Ranasinghe said. For example, I went to school in Sichuan and knew that Sichuan people like spicy food. Sri Lanka is also a country that likes spicy food very much. I welcome more Chinese tourists to visit my hometown. Source: Xinhua --Agencies",

The meeting focused on fostering greater collaboration in the area of security and addressing shared challenges affecting both nations and the region, the Embassy and Permanent Mission of Sri Lanka in Bangkok said in a statement. During the meeting, both sides underscored the importance of enhancing bilateral interaction to strengthen security cooperation. The discussion continued on strategies to deepen collaboration between the NSC of Thailand and Sri Lanka in areas such as national defense, countering human trafficking, and addressing transboundary security issues, which have become significant concerns for the region, the statement mentioned. Ambassador Edirisinghe emphasized the need to enhance defense cooperation and sought support for knowledge-sharing initiatives on policy development in national security. She also highlighted the importance of capacity-building programs and expertise exchange to help Sri Lanka develop robust national security policies and frameworks. In response, Secretary-General Chatchai Bangchuad expressed Thailands commitment to fostering stronger ties with Sri Lanka and assured his support in critical areas. He emphasized Thailands readiness to assist in rescue operations for victims of human trafficking, particularly in cybercrime centers in Myanmar, which pose a growing regional threat, the Sri Lanka Embassy said. The Office of the National Security Council, which operates under the Office of the Prime Minister in Thailand, plays a pivotal role in coordinating security and defense policies for the nation. The ambassador praised the NSCs role in advancing national security and expressed Sri Lankas eagerness to learn from Thailands experience in policy development and implementation. This high-level engagement marks another step forward in the long-standing partnership between Sri Lanka and Thailand, reaffirming their shared commitment to regional stability and security.

        "title": "South Koreas impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol arrested",
        "date": "January 15, 2025 07:46 am",
        "content": "South Korean president Yoon Suk Yeol was reportedly arrested by the countrys Corruption Investigation Office for High Ranking officials, a first for a sitting South Korean leader. This was the second bid to arrest the impeached president, following a failed attempt on Jan.3 when agents from South Koreas Presidential Security Service had blocked investigators from entering Yoons residence. About 1,000 police officers were reportedly involved in the second attempt to execute the arrest warrant, almost 10 times more than the first attempt. The CIO had initially requested the arrest warrant after Yoon failed to turn up for questioning, which was granted on Dec. 31 by a Seoul district court. The warrant was then extended after it initially expired on Jan. 6. Yoon faces charges of insurrection after his failed declaration of martial law on Dec. 3, a charge which is not subject to presidential immunity and carries the death penalty at maximum. On Dec. 3, Yoon had made a surprise late night broadcast and declared martial law, citing the need to protect the country from North Korean communist forces and antistate forces. This was the first time martial law had been declared in South Korea in over 40 years. Lawmakers then managed to get past police barricades and voted down the declaration at the countrys parliament, before filing impeachment motions against Yoon a few days later. Yoon was impeached on Dec. 14 and suspended from office. South Koreas Constitutional Court has opened the impeachment trial on Jan. 14 against Yoon, but adjourned it to Jan. 16 after Yoon did not turn up. Hundreds of law enforcement officers entered the residential compound of South Koreas impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol early Wednesday in their second attempt to detain him over his imposition of martial law last month. Investigators from the Corruption Investigation Office for High-Ranking Officials were negotiating with the presidents attorneys, and Yoon had not been apprehended as of midmorning. The officers seemingly encountered no meaningful resistance from presidential security forces as they approached Yoons residence and there were no immediate reports of clashes. More than a thousand anti-corruption investigators and police officers were deployed in the operation to apprehend Yoon, who has been holed up in the Hannam-dong residence in the capital, Seoul, for weeks while vowing to fight to the end against the efforts to oust him. Yoon has justified his declaration of martial law Dec. 3 as a legitimate act of governance against an anti-state opposition employing its legislative majority to thwart his agenda. Yoons lawyers were trying to persuade investigators not to execute the detention warrant, saying the president would voluntarily appear for questioning, but the agency told reporters they werent immediately considering that option. The anti-corruption agency is leading a joint investigation with police and the military over whether Yoons martial law declaration amounted to an attempted rebellion and sought to bring him into custody after he ignored several summons for questioning. They have pledged more forceful measures to detain him after the presidential security service blocked their initial efforts on Jan. 3. Following an hourslong standoff at the compounds gate, anti-corruption investigators and police officers were seen moving up the hilly compound. Police officers were earlier seen using ladders to climb over rows of buses placed by the presidential security service near the compounds entrance. Anti-corruption investigators and police later arrived in front of a metal gate with a gold presidential mark thats near Yoons residential building. Some officers were seen entering a security door on the side of the metal gate, joined by one of Yoons lawyers and his chief of staff. The presidential security service later removed a bus and other vehicles that had been parked tightly inside the gate as a barricade. Seok Dong-hyeon, a lawyer for Yoon, said attorneys at the residence were negotiating with the anti-corruption agency over the possibility the president could voluntarily appear for questioning. It was unclear whether law enforcement would accept the offer from Yoons lawyers, as the president previously evaded multiple requests to appear for questioning before the agency sought court warrants for his detention. Despite a court warrant for Yoons detention, the presidential security service has insisted its obligated to protect the impeached president and has fortified the compound with barbed wire and rows of buses blocking paths. If investigators manage to detain Yoon Suk Yeol, they will likely ask a court for permission to make a formal arrest. Otherwise, he will be released after 48 hours. The preparations and the concerns As tensions escalated, South Koreas acting leader, Deputy Prime Minister Choi Sang-mok, issued a statement early Wednesday urging law enforcement and the presidential security service to ensure there are no physical clashes. The liberal opposition Democratic Party, which drove a legislative campaign that led to Yoons impeachment on Dec. 14, issued a statement calling for the presidential security service to stand down and cooperate with Yoons detention. Lawmakers from Yoons People Power Party held a rally near the presidential residence, decrying the efforts to detain him as unlawful. The National Police Agency has convened multiple meetings of field commanders in Seoul and nearby Gyeonggi province in recent days to plan their detainment efforts, and the size of those forces fueled speculation that more than a thousand officers could be deployed in a possible multiday operation. The agency and police have openly warned that presidential bodyguards obstructing the execution of the warrant could be arrested. Yoons lawyers said the presidential security service will continue to provide security for Yoon and claimed that the detainment warrant issued by the Seoul Western District Court was invalid. They cited a law that protects locations potentially linked to military secrets from search without the consent of the person in charge  which would be Yoon. The court warrant for Yoons detainment is valid through Jan. 21. Yoons supporters and critics have held competing protests near the residence  one side vowing to protect him, the other calling for his imprisonment  while thousands of police officers in yellow jackets closely monitored the tense situation. --Agencies",

        "title": "UK anti-corruption minister resigns over ties to ousted Bangladesh PM",
        "date": "January 15, 2025 08:40 am",
        "content": "The British minister responsible for financial services and fighting corruption resigned on Tuesday after weeks of questions over her financial ties to her aunt Sheikh Hasina, ousted last year as prime minister of Bangladesh. Tulip Siddiq, 42, had repeatedly denied any wrongdoing and Prime Minister Keir Starmer said last week he had full confidence in her. The resignation of a second government minister in two months is a blow to Starmer, whose approval ratings have plunged since his Labour Party won a general election in July. Siddiq was handed the portfolio for financial services policy after the election, a role that included responsibility for measures against money-laundering. In a letter to Starmer, Siddiq said she was resigning because her position was likely to be a distraction from the work of the government. The governments ethics adviser said in his letter to Starmer released at the same time that although Siddiq had not breached the ministerial code of conduct, he found it regrettable she was not more alert to the potential reputational risks from her familys close association with Bangladesh. You will want to consider her ongoing responsibilities in the light of this, he said. Starmer swiftly appointed Emma Reynolds, who was a pensions minister, to Siddiqs role. Hasina, who had ruled Bangladesh since 2009, is being investigated there on suspicion of corruption and money laundering. Hasina and her party deny wrongdoing. Siddiq was named in December as part of Bangladeshs investigation into whether her family were involved in siphoning off funds from Bangladeshi infrastructure projects. The anti-corruption commission alleged financial irregularities worth billions of dollars in the awarding of a 12.65 billion nuclear power contract, saying Hasina and Siddiq may have benefited. After facing further scrutiny over the use of properties in Britain linked to Hasina and her supporters, Siddiq referred herself to the governments independent ethics adviser. Siddiq lived in a north London property given to her family in 2009 by Moin Ghani, a Bangladeshi lawyer who has represented Hasinas government, documents filed with Companies House and the Land Registry show. She also acquired a separate property in London in 2004, without paying for it, from a developer linked to the Awami League, Hasinas political party, the Financial Times reported this month. Hasina fled Bangladesh after being toppled following weeks of protests. Siddiqs departure follows the resignation of British transport minister Louise Haigh late last year. Haigh acknowledged a minor criminal offence before she entered government, relating to a mobile phone that she had wrongly reported stolen. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

The prevailing rainy weather has raised the water levels of the Senanayake Samudraya in Ampara, bringing it closer to its overflow level. It was reported that if the reservoir, which has a maximum capacity of 770,000 acre-feet of water, reaches its maximum limit of 110 feet, it will begin overflowing. As of this morning (15), the water level of the reservoir stood at 103 feet. In response, authorities have taken precautionary measures by slightly opening two spill gates to manage the increasing water levels. However, concerns remain high, as continued heavy rains may necessitate the fully opening of the spill gates, significantly increasing the Gal Oyas water flow. The riverbanks in the Suduwella and Kotawehera areas have already experienced severe erosion, heightening fears of potential breaches.",

        "content": "The United States Securities and Exchange Commission has sued Elon Musk, arguing that his purchase of Twitter shares in 2022 was carried out with violations, the regulator said in a filing published Tuesday. Defendant Elon Musk failed to timely file with the SEC a beneficial ownership report disclosing his acquisition of more than five percent of the outstanding shares of Twitters common stock in March 2022, in violation of the federal securities laws, the agency said in a court filing. According to the SEC, the omission enabled Musk, the worlds richest man and a close ally of President-elect Donald Trump, to continue purchasing shares at artificially low prices, allowing him to underpay by at least 150 million for shares he purchased after his beneficial ownership report was due. Alex Spiro, an attorney for Musk, called the filing a sham that culminated a multi-year campaign of harassment against the billionaire. Todays action is an admission by the SEC that...they cannot bring an actual case, he said in an email to AFP. Musks role at the social network has been marked by numerous controversies and led to various legal actions on the part of investors, former employees and companies that had contracts with Twitter, now called X. Shareholders, for example, have filed a lawsuit against Musk, accusing him of disclosing his five percent stake in Twitter too late, after the deadline set by the SEC. Source: AFP --Agencies",

        "date": "January 15, 2025 04:48 pm",
        "content": "Drake has scrapped a legal case against Universal Music and Spotify, in which he accused the companies of conspiring to boost the streams of Kendrick Lamars diss track against him, Not Like Us. The Canadian star took action last November, alleging that the music companies had used bots, payola and other methods to promote Lamars song, which accused him of paedophilia. The record-shattering spread of Not Like Us on streaming, sales, and radio play was deliberate and appears to have relied upon irregular and inappropriate business practices, court documents alleged. However, on Tuesday, Drakes lawyers voluntarily withdrew a pre-action filing, effectively ending the case. According to court documents filed in New York, the star met with representatives of Spotify and Universal on Tuesday to discuss the case. Spotify, which had filed an opposition, had no objection to the withdrawal and discontinuance. Universal, which hadnt filed an opposition, reserved its position. A related case, filed against Universal and radio network iHeartRadio in Texas, is still active. Not Like Us was widely regarded as the decisive blow in a long-running feud between Drake and Lamar, which dates back to the early 2010s. In the lyrics, Lamar alleges that Drake likes em young and accuses him of using other, more credible rappers, to boost his profile. Around 24 hours later, Drake responded with a track called The Heart Part 6, where he rejected the allegations, saying, I never been with no one under age. He also claimed to have fed Lamar false information through a double agent. However, his retort failed to attract the same attention as Not Like Us, which debuted at number one in the US chart and attracted more than 1 billion streams on Spotify. Taking to the courts, Drake accused Universal - which distributes both his music and Lamars - of artificially boosting the songs numbers. In court documents, he claimed that the label licensed the song at drastically reduced rates to Spotify and used bots to stream the song, generating the false impression that the song was more popular than it was in reality. The papers were not a lawsuit, but a pre-action petition, in which Drakes lawyers sought to gain access to internal documents at Spotify and Universal which might have supported their case. In a statement at the time, Universal told the BBC: The suggestion that the company would do anything to undermine any of its artists is offensive and untrue. We employ the highest ethical practices in our marketing and promotional campaigns. No amount of contrived and absurd legal arguments in this pre-action submission can mask the fact that fans choose the music they want to hear. Spotify also responded that there was no economic incentive for users to stream Not Like Us over any of Drakes tracks. The Swedish streaming company later filed an opposition brief to Drakes petition, stating that it should be denied. Music industry experts had been sceptical that the accusations would ever reach trial. Some suggested that Drake was using the court to leverage Universal for information that could allow him to potentially sue for a breach of contract and get out of his deal. But entertainment lawyer Kevin Casini said the proposed legal action could do Drakes reputation more harm than good. The media coverage really only serves to bring more attention to the lyrics that Drake finds offensive or objectionable, he told Rolling Stone magazine. And I think the streaming numbers for the song will just go up again. Source: BBC --Agencies",

The landers will eventually separate once they reach the Moons orbit and conduct independent explorations. They are the latest in a growing number of commercial missions to the Moon. Fireflys rover, Blue Ghost, is expected to take about 45 days to reach the Moon, once it has separated from the SpaceX rocket. It will then drill, collect samples and also take X-ray images of the Earths magnetic field to advance research for future human missions on the Moon and provide insights into how space weather impacts the planet, according to SpaceX. Meanwhile, ispaces Resilence lander will take up to five months to reach the Moons surface, where it will deploy a rover for exploration and attempt to scoop up loose surface material known as regolith. Nasa is backing the endeavour, which, if successful, will be its biggest commercial delivery to the Moon so far. Intuitive Machines last year became the first commercial outfit to put a lander on the Moon, a feat only previously accomplished by the US, the Soviet Union, China, India and Japan.

        "title": "Trump advisers concede Ukraine peace deal is months away",
        "date": "January 15, 2025 05:52 pm",
        "content": "Advisers to President-elect Donald Trump now concede that the Ukraine war will take months or even longer to resolve, a sharp reality check on his biggest foreign policy promise - to strike a peace deal on his first day in the White House. Two Trump associates, who have discussed the war in Ukraine with the president-elect, told Reuters they were looking at a timeline of months to resolve the conflict, describing the Day One promises as a combination of campaign bluster and a lack of appreciation of the intractability of the conflict and the time it takes to staff up a new administration. Those assessments dovetail with remarks by Trumps incoming Russia-Ukraine envoy, retired Lieutenant-General Keith Kellogg, who said in an interview with Fox News last week that he would like to have a solution to the war within 100 days, far beyond the president-elects original timeline. Yet even Kelloggs extended deadline was way, way too optimistic, said John Herbst, a former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine who is now at the Atlantic Council think tank in Washington. For this to work, Trump has to persuade (Russian President Vladimir) Putin that theres a downside for being intransigent, Herbst said. In the run-up to his Nov. 5 election victory, Trump declared dozens of times that he would have a deal in place between Ukraine and Russia on his first day in office, if not before. In late October, however, he made a subtle shift in his rhetoric, and began saying he could solve the war very quickly. Since the election, Trump has walked back his rhetoric further, often simply saying that he would solve the conflict, without offering a timeline. And the president-elect has said ending the war in Ukraine will be harder than reaching a ceasefire in Gaza. I think, actually, more difficult is going to be the Russia-Ukraine situation, Trump said when asked about Gaza during a press conference in December. I see that as more difficult. Russia has also sent mixed signals regarding a possible peace deal, welcoming direct talks with Trump, while dismissing some of the ideas put forth by his advisers as unworkable. The Kremlin declined to comment on the Trump teams updated timeline. Representatives for Trumps incoming administration and the Ukrainian embassy in Washington did not respond to requests for comment. Nothing of Interest Russia has made significant battlefield gains in recent months. While those gains have come at a huge cost in terms of men and materiel, many analysts argue Putin has an incentive to slow-walk a deal while he tries to gain control of more Ukrainian territory. Herbst pointed to comments earlier this month by Russias UN ambassador, Vasily Nebenzya, who said that the peace plans put forward by Trumps advisers were nothing of interest. While the exact contours of a Trump peace plan are still being mulled, Trumps advisers generally support taking the possibility of NATO membership for Ukraine off the table, at least for the foreseeable future, and freezing the current battle lines. Most high-ranking Trump advisers also support giving Ukraine a material security guarantee, such as the creation of a demilitarized zone patrolled by European troops. So far, the Trump teams attempts to end the war have proceeded in fits and starts, underlining the degree to which campaign promises can run into the reality of complex diplomatic negotiations. Kellogg, Trumps Ukraine envoy, postponed a planned visit to Kyiv before the inauguration, seen as part of a fact-finding mission to give officials a head start on a peace plan, Reuters reported last week. The Ukrainian foreign ministry cited U.S. concerns about violating the Logan Act, which limits the ability of private citizens to negotiate with foreign governments. I dont think its appropriate that I meet (Putin) until after the 20th, which I hate because every day people are being - many, many young people are being killed, Trump said at a press conference last week. Meanwhile, incoming Trump administration officials at the State Department, National Security Council and other agencies are still feeling out who has input and jurisdiction over different geopolitical issues, one of the Trump foreign policy advisers told Reuters.

        "date": "January 15, 2025 10:47 pm",
        "content": "(Reuters) - Israel and Hamas agreed to a deal to halt fighting in Gaza and exchange Israeli hostages for Palestinian prisoners, an official briefed on the deal told Reuters on Wednesday, opening the way to a possible end to a 15-month war that has upended the Middle East. The agreement follows months of on-off negotiations brokered by Egyptian and Qatari mediators, with the backing of the United States, and came just ahead of the Jan. 20 inauguration of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump. Israeli troops invaded Gaza after Hamas-led gunmen broke through security barriers and burst into Israeli communities on Oct. 7, 2023, killing 1,200 soldiers and civilians and abducting more than 250 foreign and Israeli hostages. Israels campaign in Gaza has killed more than 46,000 people, according to Gaza health ministry figures, and left the narrow coastal enclave a wasteland of rubble, with hundreds of thousands surviving the winter cold in tents and makeshift shelters. As his inauguration approached, Trump repeated his demand that a deal be done swiftly, warning repeatedly that there would be hell to pay if the hostages were not released. His Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff worked with President Joe Bidens team to push the deal over the line. In Israel, the return of the hostages may ease some of the public anger against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his right-wing government over the Oct. 7 security failure that led to the deadliest single day in the countrys history. The conflict spread across the Middle East, with Iran-backed proxies in Lebanon, Iraq and Yemen attacking Israel in solidarity with the Palestinians. The deal comes after Israel killed the top leaders of Hamas and Lebanons Hezbollah in assassinations which gave it the upper hand. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "content": "U.S. President Joe Biden and President-elect Donald Trump both claimed credit on Wednesday for a Gaza ceasefire-for-hostages deal that was months in the making but was helped across the line by a Trump envoy. In announcing the ceasefire, Biden noted the final deal largely mirrored the framework of a proposal he made back in May. He smiled when a reporter asked who the history books will credit for the ceasefire and asked, Is that a joke? This plan was developed and negotiated by my team and will be largely implemented by the incoming administration. Thats why I told my team to keep the incoming administration fully informed, Biden said in a farewell address on Wednesday night from the Oval Office. Trump, in a social media post, was quick to claim a measure of credit for the breakthrough that came after months of stalled negotiations. He had repeatedly warned there would be hell to pay if a deal was not made by the time he takes office on Monday. This EPIC ceasefire agreement could have only happened as a result of our Historic Victory in November, as it signaled to the entire World that my Administration would seek Peace and negotiate deals to ensure the safety of all Americans, and our Allies, he said. Trump had dispatched his Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, to join the negotiations in Doha, and Witkoff was there for the last 96 hours of talks leading up to the deal. A senior Biden administration official, in a briefing with reporters, credited Witkoff with helping deliver the deal, working alongside Bidens envoy, Brett McGurk, who has been in Doha since Jan. 5. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters that Biden had wanted the Trump team involved because Trump will be tasked with implementing the ceasefire deal. In these past few days, we have been speaking as one team, Biden said. Biden did not provide specifics outside the broad outlines of the deal that were already known, but suggested it could set the stage for an independent Palestinian state alongside Israel. For the Palestinian people, a credible, credible pathway to a state of their own. And for the region, a future of normalization, integration of Israel and all its Arab neighbors, including Saudi Arabia, he said. The latest bloodshed in the decades-old Israeli-Palestinian conflict was triggered on Oct. 7, 2023, when Hamas attacked Israel, killing 1,200 and taking about 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies. Israels subsequent military assault on Gaza has killed over 46,000 Palestinians, according to the local health ministry, while also leading to accusations of genocide and war crimes that Israel denies. The assault has displaced the entire population of Gaza and caused a hunger crisis. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "title": "TikTok prepares to shut down app in US on Sunday, sources say",
        "date": "January 16, 2025 08:09 am",
        "content": "TikTok plans to shut U.S. operations of its social media app used by 170 million Americans on Sunday, when a federal ban is set to take effect, barring a last-minute reprieve, people familiar with the matter said on Wednesday. The Washington Post reported President-elect Donald Trump, whose term begins a day after a ban would start, is considering issuing an executive order to suspend enforcement of a shutdown for 60 to 90 days. The newspaper did not say how Trump could legally do so. The law signed in April mandates a ban on new TikTok downloads on Apple or Google app stores if Chinese parent ByteDance fails to divest the site. Users who have downloaded TikTok would theoretically still be able to use the app, except that the law also bars U.S. companies starting Sunday from providing services to enable the distribution, maintenance, or updating of it. The Trump transition team did not have an immediate comment. Trump has said he should have time after taking office to pursue a political resolution of the issue. TikTok itself is a fantastic platform, Trumps incoming national security adviser Mike Waltz told Fox News on Wednesday. Were going to find a way to preserve it but protect peoples data. A White House official told Reuters Wednesday President Joe Biden has no plans to intervene to block a ban in his final days in office if the Supreme Court fails to act and added Biden is legally unable to intervene absent a credible plan from ByteDance to divest TikTok. U.S. Senator Ed Markey on Wednesday sought unanimous consent to extend the deadline for ByteDance to divest TikTok by 270 days but Republican Senator Tom Cotton blocked the proposal. If it is banned, TikTok plans that users attempting to open the app will see a pop-up message directing them to a website with information about the ban, the people said, requesting anonymity as the matter is not public. We go dark. Essentially, the platform shuts down, TikTok lawyer Noel Francisco told the Supreme Court last week. The company also plans to give users an option to download all their data so that they can take a record of their personal information, the sources said. The U.S. Supreme Court is currently deciding whether to uphold the law and allow TikTok to be banned on Sunday, overturn the law, or pause the law to give the court more time to make a decision. Shutting down TikTok in the U.S. could make it unavailable for users in many other countries, the company said in a court filing last month, because hundreds of service providers in the U.S. help make the platform available to TikTok users around the world - and could no longer do so starting Sunday. TikTok said in the court filing an order was needed to avoid interruption of services for tens of millions of TikTok users outside the United States. TikTok had said that the prohibitions would eventually make the app unusable, noting in the filing that data centers would almost certainly conclude that they can no longer store TikTok code, content, or data. The sources said the shutdown aims to protect TikTok service providers from legal liability and make it easier to resume operations if President-elect Donald Trump opted to roll back any ban. Shutting down such services does not require longer planning, one of the sources said, noting that most operations have been continuing as usual as of this week. If the ban gets reversed later, TikTok would be able to restore service for U.S. users in a relatively short time, sources said. TikTok and its Chinese parent, ByteDance, did not immediately respond to Reuters requests for comment. U.S. tech publication The Information first reported the news late on Tuesday. Privately held ByteDance is about 60 owned by institutional investors such as BlackRock and General Atlantic, while its founders and employees own 20 each. It has more than 7,000 employees in the United States. President Joe Biden last April signed a law requiring ByteDance to sell its U.S. assets by Jan. 19, or face a nationwide ban. Last week, the Supreme Court seemed inclined to uphold the law, despite calls from Trump and lawmakers to extend the deadline. TikTok and ByteDance have sought, at the very least, a delay in the implementation of the law, which they say violates the U.S. Constitutions First Amendment protection against government abridgment of free speech. TikTok said in the court filing last month it estimated one-third of its 170 million American users would stop accessing the platform if the ban lasted a month. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "date": "January 16, 2025 03:28 pm",
        "content": "India on Thursday became the fourth country to successfully achieve an unmanned docking in space, a feat seen as pivotal for future missions as New Delhi cements its place as a global space power. The United States, Russia and China are the only other countries to have developed and tested the docking capability. Spacecraft docking successfully completed! A historic moment, the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) said on X. The Indian space agencys mission, called the Space Docking Experiment (SpaDex), involved deploying two small spacecraft, weighing about 220 kilograms each, into low-earth orbit. The two spacecraft, called Target and Chaser, blasted off from the Satish Dhawan Space Center in southern Andhra Pradesh state on December 30 aboard an Indian-made PSLV rocket. On Thursday, they conducted a rendezvous before docking together. Congratulations to our scientists at ISRO and the entire space fraternity for the successful demonstration of space docking of satellites. It is a significant stepping stone for Indias ambitious space missions in the years to come, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on X. In-docking technology is critical for future space endeavors, such as satellite servicing and when multiple rocket launches are required to achieve mission objectives. Domestically developed docking technology will be crucial if India is to succeed in advancing its ambition of putting an Indian national on the moon, building a home-grown space station, and returning lunar samples, according to the ISRO. The technology will allow India to transfer materials from one satellite or spacecraft to another, such as payloads, lunar samples or, eventually, humans in space, Singh told reporters at a press conference on December 31. As part of the mission, the docked spacecraft will also demonstrate the transfer of electric power between them, once they are linked. This is essential for operating in-space robotics, spacecraft control, and payload operations during future missions. Before the docking, India on Sunday conducted a trial attempt where the two satellites were brought progressively closer together in orbit until they reached 3 meters apart, before moving back to a safe distance. The successful docking came after the experiment was twice postponed on January 7 and 9 due to technical issues, and the spacecraft drifting more than expected during a maneuver to bring them closer together. A global space race Indias space ambitions have accelerated under Modi, who was elected to a third term last June and has tried to assert Indias place on the global stage. In 2023, India joined an elite space club becoming the fourth country to land a spacecraft on the moon. The historic Chandrayaan-3 mission, the first to make a soft landing close to the moons unexplored South Pole, has collected samples that are helping scientists understand how the moon was formed and evolved over time. As part of its ambitious plans, India aims to launch its first crewed mission to space in the next few years, and put an astronaut on the moon  a feat only ever achieved by the US  by 2040. The country has also set its sights on building its own space station by 2035, which will be called the Bharatiya Antariksha Station, and launching its first orbital mission to Venus in 2028. It also plans to return moon samples as part of its ongoing lunar Chandarayaan program in 2027. India has also made a major push to commercialize its space sector in recent years, allowing private enterprise and easing approvals for foreign investment, which has focused on building and launching small satellites into low-Earth orbit more cheaply. For Sundays docking experiment, the rocket and spacecraft were integrated and tested at private company Ananth Technologies, in a first for the country. Source: CNN --Agencies",

The planned meeting of Israels security cabinet has been delayed amid accusations from Netanyahus office that Hamas were reneging on parts of the deal by attempting to obtain concessions on some aspects. Netanyahus office told Reuters: Hamas reneges on parts of the agreement reached with the mediators and Israel in an effort to extort last minute concessions. The Israeli cabinet will not convene until the mediators notify Israel that Hamas has accepted all elements of the agreement. Originally scheduled for 9am GMT, the Jerusalem Post had previously reported the delay had been caused as the hostage deal delegation hasnt finished its work in Qatar and returned to Israel. The deal follows weeks of negotiations in the Qatari capital and promises the release of dozens of hostages held by Hamas in phases, and the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners in Israel. It will also allow hundreds of thousands of people displaced in Gaza to return to what remains of their homes and allow the devastated territory access to badly needed humanitarian aid. According to reports the proposed deal, expected to take effect on Sunday, January 19, would involve a six-week initial ceasefire phase which would see the gradual withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza and the return of Palestinians to north Gaza. Hostages held by Hamas will then be released and Palestinian detainees held by Israel will also released, the Reuters news agency reported, citing an official briefed on the agreement.

        "date": "January 16, 2025 04:14 pm",
        "content": "Deputy Minister of Transport and Highways Dr. Prasanna Gunasena alleges that a major racket involving e-tickets for up-country trains to Ella is presently taking place. According to the Deputy Minister, e-tickets for this popular tourist route are sold out within an astonishing 42 seconds of their release online, raising serious concerns about fraudulent practices. Deputy Minister Gunasena made this accusation while speaking at the Kandy District Coordination Committee meeting, highlighting that a complaint has been lodged with the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) regarding the e-ticket racket. The Kandy District Coordination Committee meeting was held yesterday (15) at the Kandy District Secretariat Auditorium with Co-Chairman Minister K. D. Lalkantha and the Governor of the Central Province Prof. Sarath Abeykoon in attendance. Dr. Gunasena revealed that certain groups are purchasing all available tickets through dubious means and resell them to tourists at exorbitant prices. Tickets priced at Rs. 2,000 are reportedly being resold for as much as Rs. 16,000. The Deputy Minister identified Colombo Fort, Kandy, and Ella railway stations as the primary locations where ticket re-sales are occurring. He also noted that some individuals operating three-wheelers near these stations are allegedly complicit in the racket. Highlighting the issue, Dr. Gunasena explained that the Department of Railways releases e-tickets for specific travel dates one month in advance, yet these tickets are consistently sold out within seconds of their release online. This has fueled suspicions that the operation is being carried out by individuals or groups with advanced computer literacy. Despite the complaint to the CID, Dr. Gunasena mentioned that the investigation report is still pending. He called for immediate action to address the issue, stating that the current situation undermines public confidence in the ticketing system. Adding to the complexity of the investigation, police have noted that legal action is hindered by the reluctance of affected passengers to formally participate in the judicial process. While many accuse resellers of exploiting the system, the lack of formal complaints has created obstacles for law enforcement officers.",

        "title": "Death toll rises to 87 as standoff between police and miners ends in South Africa",
        "date": "January 16, 2025 07:04 pm",
        "content": "The death toll in a monthslong standoff between police and miners trapped while working illegally in an abandoned gold mine in South Africa has risen to at least 87, police said Thursday. Authorities faced growing anger and a possible investigation over their initial refusal to help the miners and instead smoke them out by cutting off their food supplies. National police spokesperson Athlenda Mathe said that 78 bodies were retrieved in a court-ordered rescue operation, with 246 survivors also pulled out from deep underground since the operation began on Monday. Mathe said nine other bodies had been recovered before the rescue operation, without giving details. Community groups launched their own rescue attempts when authorities said last year they would not help the hundreds of miners because they were criminals. The miners are suspected to have died of starvation and dehydration, although no causes of death have been released. South African authorities have been fiercely criticized for cutting off food and supplies to the miners in the Buffelsfontein Gold Mine last year. That tactic to smoke them out, as described by a prominent Cabinet minister, was condemned by one of South Africas biggest trade unions. Police and the mine owners were also accused of taking away ropes and dismantling a pulley system the miners used to enter the mine and send supplies down from the surface. A court ordered authorities last year to allow food and water to be sent down to the miners, while another court ruling last week forced them to launch a rescue operation. Many say the unfolding disaster underground was clear weeks ago, when community members sporadically pulled decomposing bodies out of the mine, some with notes attached pleading for food to be sent down. If the police had acted earlier, we would not be in this situation, with bodies piling up, said Johannes Qankase, a local community leader. It is a disgrace for a constitutional democracy like ours. Somebody needs to account for what has happened here. South Africas second biggest political party, which is part of a government coalition, called for President Cyril Ramaphosa to establish an independent inquiry to find out why the situation was allowed to get so badly out of hand. The scale of the disaster underground at Buffelsfontein is rapidly proving to be as bad as feared, the Democratic Alliance party said. Authorities now believe that nearly 2,000 miners were working illegally in the mine near the town of Stilfontein, southwest of Johannesburg, since August last year. Many of them resurfaced on their own over the last few months, police said, and all the survivors have been arrested, even as some emerged this week badly emaciated and barely able to walk to waiting ambulances. A convoy of mortuary vans arrived at the mine to carry away the bodies. Mathe said at least 13 children had also come out of the mine before the official rescue operation. Police announced Wednesday that they were ending that operation after three days and said they believed no one else was underground. A camera was sent down on Thursday in a cage that was used to pull out survivors and bodies to ensure no one was left behind, Mathe said. The mine is one of the deepest in South Africa and is a maze of tunnels and levels and has several shafts leading into it. The miners were working up to 2.5 kilometers (1.5 miles) underground in different groups. Police have maintained that the miners were able to come out through several shafts but refused out of fear of being arrested. Thats been disputed by groups representing the miners, who say hundreds were trapped and left starving in dark and damp conditions with decomposing bodies around them. The initial police operation last year to force the miners to come out and give themselves up for arrest was part of a larger nationwide clampdown on illegal mining called Vala Umgodi, or Close the Hole. Illegal mining is often in the news in South Africa and a major problem for authorities as large groups go into mines that have been shut down to extract any leftover deposits. Gold-rich South Africa has an estimated 6,000 abandoned or closed mines. The illicit miners, known as zama zamas  hustlers or chancers in the Zulu language  are usually armed and part of criminal syndicates, the government says, and they rob South Africa of more than 1 billion a year in gold deposits. They are often undocumented foreign nationals and authorities said that the vast majority who came out of the Buffelsfontein mine were from Mozambique, Zimbabwe and Lesotho who were in South Africa illegally. Police said they seized gold, explosives, firearms and more than 2 million in cash from the miners and have defended their hardline approach. By providing food, water and necessities to these illegal miners, it would be the police entertaining and allowing criminality to thrive, Mathe said Wednesday. But the South African Federation of Trade Unions questioned the governments humanity and how it could allow anyone  be they citizens or undocumented immigrants  to starve to death in the depths of the earth. While the police operation has been condemned by civic groups, the disaster hasnt provoked a strong outpouring of anger across South Africa, where the mostly foreign zama zamas have long been considered unwelcome in a country that already struggles with high rates of violent crime.

        "date": "January 17, 2025 07:57 am",
        "content": "The Chairman of Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority (SLTDA) Buddhika Hewawasam assures that Sri Lanka possesses the necessary infrastructure to achieve the governments target of attracting 3 million tourists to the island this year. Speaking to the media, Hewawasam went on to say that the SLTDA will take action to streamline the process of investing in the tourism industry and stated that action is being taken against foreigners operating businesses in Sri Lanka while on tourist visas. Speaking regarding the matter, Hewawasam added: Among all the rooms in Sri Lankan tourist hotels, only a few have been documented in government censuses. There are a significant number of rooms that are not under government regulation but are catering to tourists. If we consider both of these categories together, there are sufficient rooms. We do not want to destroy such illegal operations, but we do want them to be regulated. By obtaining legal status, these businesses can be eligible to receive certain government services. Furthermore, the SLTDA Chairman said that if there are businesses that refuse to obtain legal status even with that being the case, the authorities will not hesitate to initiate legal action against them. Moreover, he said that there is a trend of accommodation being constructed at locations that are already tourist hotspots but not at locations that have the potential to become tourist destinations. In order to mitigate this situation, we must attract more investors. To that end, we are currently putting government-owned lands that have been earmarked for tourism into the care of a land bank. This land bank will streamline the process of investing in tourism, and the Tourism Development Authority is facilitating the issuance of relevant licenses and permits to such investors, he expressed He also mentioned that the SLTDA already has an investment relations unit, and that it is in the process of digitizing it. Addressing the concerns that some foreigners arrive on tourist visas and operate tourism businesses for years in the country, the tourism regulatory bodys chief highlighted: We have already arrested several such individuals on the Southern coast, and some of them have already been deported. If a person who arrives on a tourist visa takes up an occupation, they are no longer a tourist. Their country of origin is irrelevant. Tourism professionals and locals have been informing us of such individuals, and we request that they continue to do so. If the information is true, we can take immediate legal action. We are already conducting such operations in Unawatuna, Bentota, and Mirissa, and we hope to expand them to the rest of Sri Lanka, Hewawasam said. We have reached an agreement with the Acting Inspector General of Police and the Senior Deputy Inspector General of Police in charge of the Tourist Police to attach two officers who specialize in tourist policing to all police stations in tourist zones, he added. A centralized unit for this purpose will also be established.We have also sought advice from the Attorney General regarding the establishment of a unit within the Tourism Development Authority to initiate legal action against these individuals, Hewawasam emphasized.",

        "title": "Netanyahu says deal to release hostages held in Gaza has been reached",
        "date": "January 17, 2025 08:38 am",
        "content": "Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Friday a deal to return hostages held in the Gaza Strip has been reached, after his office had said earlier there were last minute snags in finalizing a ceasefire that would pause 15 months of war. Netanyahu said he would convene his security Cabinet later Friday and then the government will approve the long-awaited hostage deal. Netanyahus pre-dawn statement appeared to clear the way for Israeli approval of the deal, which would pause the fighting in the Gaza Strip and see dozens of hostages held by militants in Gaza released in exchange for Palestinian prisoners held by Israel. The deal would also allow hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians to return to the remains of their homes in Gaza. Israeli airstrikes, meanwhile, killed at least 72 people in the war-ravaged territory on Thursday. Netanyahu said he had instructed a special task force to prepare to receive the hostages returning from Gaza, and that their families had been informed the deal had been reached. Israel had delayed a vote Thursday on the ceasefire, blaming a last-minute dispute with Hamas for holding up approval as rising tensions in Netanyahus government coalition raised concerns about the implementation of the deal just a day after U.S. President Joe Biden and key mediator Qatar announced it was complete. Netanyahus office had accused Hamas of reneging on parts of the agreement in an attempt to gain further concessions. In a briefing Thursday, David Mencer, an Israeli government spokesman, said Hamas new demands dealt with the deployment of Israeli forces in the Philadelphi corridor, the narrow strip bordering Egypt that Israeli troops seized in May. Hamas denied the claims, with Izzat al-Rishq, a senior Hamas official, saying the militant group is committed to the ceasefire agreement, which was announced by the mediators. The ceasefire agreement has drawn fierce resistance from Netanyahus far-right coalition partners, which the Israeli prime minister depends on to remain in power. On Thursday, Israels hard-line national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, threatened to quit the government if Israel approved the ceasefire. There was no immediate comment from Ben-Gvir following Netanyahus statement the hostage deal had been reached. Egyptian Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty called on Israel and Hamas to implement a Gaza ceasefire plan without any delay in an exclusive interview Thursday with The Associated Press. Egypt has been a key mediator between the enemies for years and a leading player in ongoing ceasefire negotiations. The deal announced Wednesday would pause the fighting with a view to eventually wind down a 15-month war that has destabilized the Middle East and sparked worldwide protests. Hamas triggered the war with its Oct. 7, 2023, cross-border attack into Israel that killed some 1,200 people and took 250 others hostage. Israel responded with a devastating offensive that has killed over 46,000 Palestinians, according to local health officials, who do not distinguish between civilians and militants but say women and children make up more than half of those killed. The military campaign has leveled vast swaths of Gaza, and pushed about 90 of Gazas population of 2.3 million from their homes. Hundreds of thousands are struggling with hunger and disease in squalid tent camps on the coast. Netanyahu faces heavy internal pressure The Israeli prime minister has faced great domestic pressure to bring home the hostages, whose families have pleaded with Netanyahu to prioritize the release of their loved ones over politics. But Israeli divisions over the deal were on stark display Thursday, as Ben-Gvir, a keycoalition partner, threatened to resign, saying the ceasefire was reckless and would destroy all of Israels achievements. The departure of Ben-Gvirs Jewish Power party would reduce the number of the ruling coalitions seats in the Israeli parliament, or Knesset, from 68 to 62  leaving Netanyahus government with just the slimmest of majorities. Ben-Gvir said his party would return to the coalition if Israel resumes its war. Ben-Gvirs resignation would not bring down the government or derail the ceasefire deal. But the move would destabilize the government at a delicate moment and could lead to its collapse if Ben-Gvir is joined by other key Netanyahu allies. Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, for instance, is vehemently opposed to the agreement and has demanded that Netanyahu promise to resume the war against Hamas after the first phase of the ceasefire as a condition of his party staying in the coalition. A night of heavy Israeli strikes Palestinians in Gaza reported heavy Israeli bombardment Thursday as people were celebrating the ceasefire deal. In previous conflicts, both sides have stepped up military operations in the final hours before ceasefires as a way to project strength. We were expecting that the (Israeli) occupation would intensify the bombing, like they did every time there were reports of progress in truce talks, said Mohammed Mahdi, who is sheltering in Gaza City. Gazas Health Ministry said Israeli strikeskilled at least 72 people since the ceasefire deal was announced. It said the toll from Thursdays strikes only includes bodies brought to two hospitals in Gaza City and the actual toll is likely higher. Yesterday was a bloody day, and today is bloodier, said Zaher al-Wahedi, a Health Ministry official. The Israeli military said it had struck approximately 50 militant targets across the Gaza Strip over the past day, including weapons storage facilities and rocket launch sites. Anxiety spread across Gaza on Thursday with the news of last-minute quarreling between Hamas and Israeli officials. We ask our brothers in Hamas to communicate with mediators to end the war, said Omar Jendiya, in Deir al-Balah. Enough with the destruction and killing. A phased withdrawal and hostage release with potential pitfalls Under the deal reached Wednesday, 33 of some 100 hostages who remain in Gaza are set to be released over the next six weeks in exchange for hundreds of Palestinians imprisoned by Israel. Israeli forces will pull back from many areas, hundreds of thousands of Palestinians would be able to return to whats left of their homes, and there would be a surge of humanitarian assistance. The remainder of the hostages, including male soldiers, are to be released in a second  and much more difficult  phase that will be negotiated during the first. Hamas has said it will not release the remaining captives without a lasting ceasefire and a full Israeli withdrawal, while Israel has vowed to keep fighting until it dismantles the group and to maintain open-ended security control over the territory. Ceasefire leaves questions about Gazas future unanswered U.S. President-elect Donald Trumps Mideast envoy joined the talks in the final weeks, and both the outgoing administration and Trumps team took credit for the breakthrough. Longer-term questions about postwar Gaza remain, including who will rule the territory or oversee the daunting task of reconstruction. Israel has come under heavy international criticism, including from its closest ally, the United States, over the civilian toll in Gaza. It also blames Hamas for the civilian casualties, accusing it of using schools, hospitals and residential areas for military purposes. Hamas has come under overwhelming pressure from Israels invasion of Gazas largest cities and towns and seizure of the border between Gaza and Egypt. Its top leaders, including Yahya Sinwar, who was believed to have helped mastermind the 2023 attack, have been killed. But its fighters have regrouped in some of the hardest-hit areas after the withdrawal of Israeli forces, raising the prospect of a prolonged insurgency if the war continues. Source: AP --Agencies",

        "date": "January 17, 2025 10:05 am",
        "content": "A SpaceX Starship rocket broke up in space minutes after launching from Texas on Thursday, forcing airline flights over the Gulf of Mexico to alter course to avoid falling debris and setting back Elon Musks flagship rocket program. SpaceX launched its Starship rocket on its latest test flight Thursday, but the spacecraft was destroyed following a thrilling booster catch back at the pad. Elon Musks company said Starship broke apart  what it called a rapid unscheduled disassembly. The spacecrafts six engines appeared to shut down one by one during ascent, with contact lost just 8 12 minutes into the flight. The spacecraft  a new and upgraded model making its debut  was supposed to soar across the Gulf of Mexico from Texas on a near loop around the world similar to previous test flights. SpaceX had packed it with 10 dummy satellites for practice at releasing them. A minute before the loss, SpaceX used the launch towers giant mechanical arms to catch the returning booster, a feat achieved only once before. The descending booster hovered over the launch pad before being gripped by the pair of arms dubbed chopsticks. The thrill of the catch quickly turned into disappointment for not only the company, but the crowds gathered along the southern tip of Texas. It was great to see a booster come down, but we are obviously bummed out about ship, said SpaceX spokesman Dan Huot, adding it would take time to analyze the data and figure out what happened. Its a flight test. Its an experimental vehicle. The last data received from the spacecraft indicated an altitude of 90 miles (146 kilometres) and a velocity of 13,245 mph (21,317 kph). The 400-foot (123-metre) rocket had thundered away in late afternoon from Boca Chica Beach near the Mexican border. The late hour ensured a daylight entry halfway around the world in the Indian Ocean. But the shiny retro-looking spacecraft never got nearly that far. SpaceX had made improvements to the spacecraft for the latest demo and added a fleet of satellite mockups. The test satellites were the same size as SpaceXs Starlink internet satellites and, like the spacecraft, were meant to be destroyed upon entry. Musk plans to launch actual Starlinks on Starships before moving on to other satellites and, eventually, crews. It was the seventh test flight for the worlds biggest and most powerful rocket. NASA has reserved a pair of Starships to land astronauts on the moon later this decade. Musks goal is Mars. Hours earlier in Florida, another billionaires rocket company  Jeff Bezos Blue Origin  launched the newest supersized rocket, New Glenn. The rocket reached orbit on its first flight, successfully placing an experimental satellite thousands of miles above Earth. But the first-stage booster was destroyed, missing its targeted landing on a floating platform in the Atlantic. Starship explodes after launch, massive debris seen falling from space. SpaceXs Starship exploded into countless fragments of space debris as it reentered the atmosphere over the Caribbean following its seventh test flight.

        "date": "January 17, 2025 12:45 pm",
        "content": "A Pakistani court sentenced former Prime Minister Imran Khan to 14 years imprisonment on Friday in a land corruption case, a setback to nascent talks between his party and the government aimed at cooling political instability in the south Asian nation. The verdict in the case was delivered by an anti-graft court in a prison in the garrison city of Rawalpindi, where Khan has been jailed since August 2023. Khans wife Bushra Bibi was also found guilty and sentenced to 7 years in prison. She was out on bail but was taken into custody after the judgment was pronounced, Geo News reported. Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar told reporters that Khans party could reach out to higher courts to appeal against the ruling, and that the former cricket star could also file a mercy petition to the president of Pakistan. Omar Ayub, an aide of Khan, said the party will challenge the verdict in higher courts. The former premier, 72, had been indicted on charges that he and his wife were gifted land by a real estate developer during his premiership from 2018 to 2022 in exchange for illegal favours. Khan and Bibi had pleaded not guilty. The case is linked to the Al-Qadir Trust, a non-government welfare body the couple set up when Khan was in office. Prosecutors say the trust was a front for Khan to illegally receive land from a real estate developer. They said he was given 60 acres (24 hectares) near Islamabad and another large plot close to his hilltop mansion in the capital. Khans Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party says the land was not for personal gain and was for the spiritual and educational institution the former prime minister had set up. Whilst we wait for detailed decision, its important to note that the Al Qadir Trust case against Imran Khan and Bushra Bibi lacks any solid foundation and is bound to collapse, PTIs foreign media wing said in a statement. The announcement of the verdict was delayed three times, most recently on Monday, amid reconciliation talks between PTI and the government. The two sides have been at loggerheads since Khan was ousted from office in 2022. The verdict is the biggest setback for Khan and his party since a surprisingly good showing in the 2024 general election when PTIs candidates - who were forced to contest as independents - won the most seats, but fell short of the majority needed to form a government. Jailed since August 2023, Khan has been facing dozens of casesranging from charges of graft and misuse of power, to inciting violence against the state after being removed from office in a parliamentary vote of confidence in April 2022. He has either been acquitted or his sentences suspended in most cases, except for this one and another on charges of inciting supporters to rampage through military facilities to protest against his arrest on May 9, 2023. His supporters have led several violent protest rallies since the May 9 incidents. Khans cases have been tried inside prison on security grounds. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "title": "Israeli security cabinet recommends Gaza ceasefire deal",
        "date": "January 17, 2025 07:31 pm",
        "content": "The Israeli security cabinet has recommended approving the Gaza ceasefire and hostage return deal, ahead of a full cabinet meeting expected later on Friday, a statement from the prime ministers office said. Cabinet is expected to meet at 3.30 p.m. (1330 GMT) to give final ratification to the agreement, which Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said is expected to take effect on Sunday, with the release of the first hostages. If successful, the ceasefire would halt fighting between Hamas and Israeli forces that has razed much of heavily urbanised Gaza, killed more than 46,000 people, and displaced most of the enclaves pre-war population of 2.3 million several times over, according to local authorities. It could also ease hostilities in the Middle East, where the Gaza war spread to include Iran and its proxies - Lebanons Hezbollah, Yemens Houthis and armed groups in Iraq as well as the occupied West Bank. In Gaza itself on Friday, Israeli warplanes kept up heavy strikes, and the Civil Emergency Service said that at least 101 Palestinians, including 58 women and children, had been killed since the deal was announced on Wednesday. Under the six-week first phase of the three-stage deal, Hamas will release 33 Israeli hostages, including all women (soldiers and civilians), children, and men over 50. Israel will release all Palestinian women and children under 19 detained in Israeli jails by the end of the first phase. The total number of Palestinians released will depend on hostages released, and could be between 990 and 1,650 Palestinians, including men, women and children. Hamas said in a statement on Friday that obstacles that arose in relation to the terms of the Gaza ceasefire agreement have been resolved. Israels acceptance of the deal will not be official until it is approved by the countrys security cabinet and government. In the early hours of Friday, Netanyahus office said that Israels security cabinet would meet to give final approval to the ceasefire accord after the meeting was pushed back from Thursday, raising concerns of delays. Ministers were summoned to a full cabinet meeting at 1330 GMT on Friday, an official with knowledge of the situation said, giving ample time for the ceasefire to begin on Sunday and the first hostages to be returned to Israel. Israel blamed Hamas for the last-minute hold-up, while Hamas on Thursday said it was committed to the deal, which is scheduled to take effect on Sunday. ACCORD REACHED ON HOSTAGES Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was informed by the negotiating team that agreements have been reached on a deal to release the hostages, his office said in a statement. Underscoring the potential obstacles facing a final ceasefire, hardliners in Netanyahus coalition have opposed the deal as a capitulation to Hamas, which had controlled Gaza. National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir threatened to resign if it was approved. However, he said he would not bring down the government. His fellow hardliner, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, has also threatened to quit the government if it does not go back to war to defeat Hamas after the first six-week phase of the ceasefire was completed. Nevertheless, a majority of ministers were expected to back the agreement. In Gaza, the airstrikes continued. In the aftermath of one strike on tents housing displaced people, a boy picked through damaged items on the floor that was littered with canned food and coffee pots. That attack killed two people and wounded seven at an encampment close to Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis, according to medics. Also in Khan Younis, mourners gathered around the body of a man killed in an Israeli strike as women hugged each other and cried. Life has become an unbearable hell, said resident Jomaa Abed al-Aal. There was no comment from the Israeli military on the latest strikes. HOSTAGE FAMILIES WANT SWIFT ACTION Israel says 98 hostages are still being held in Gaza. About half are believed to be alive. They include Israelis and non-Israelis. Of the total, 94 were seized in the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas-led attack on Israel and four have been held in Gaza since 2014. For the first time, Israeli authorities have officially informed hostage families of the names of the first 33 to be released but it remains unclear how many of those on the list are still alive. A group representing families of Israeli hostages in Gaza on Thursday urged Netanyahu to move forward quickly. The ceasefire accord emerged on Wednesday after mediation by Qatar, Egypt and the United States, Israels main supporter. As well as the release of hostages and Palestinian prisoners, the deal includes a gradual withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza. It also paves the way for a surge in humanitarian aid for the coastal strip, where the majority of the population has been displaced and faces hunger, sickness and cold. A World Health Organization official said on Friday it should be possible to scale up aid imports into Gaza massively to about 600 trucks a day under the terms of the deal. The aid surge requires more than a 10-fold daily increase in lorries from the daily average of 51 that U.N. data shows entered the enclave in early January. I think the possibility is very much there and specifically when other crossings will be opened up, Rik Peeperkorn, WHO representative for the Occupied Palestinian Territory, told a press briefing in Geneva. This can be built up very rapidly. Israel launched its campaign in Gaza after Hamas-led gunmen burst into Israeli border-area communities on Oct. 7, 2023, killing 1,200 soldiers and civilians and abducting over 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies.

        "title": "US supreme court issues ruling upholding nationwide ban on TikTok",
        "date": "January 17, 2025 10:27 pm",
        "content": "The Supreme Court on Friday unanimously upheld the federal law banning TikTok beginning Sunday unless its sold by its China-based parent company, holding that the risk to national security posed by its ties to China overcomes concerns about limiting speech by the app or its 170 million users in the United States. A sale does not appear imminent and, although experts have said the app will not disappear from existing users phones once the law takes effect on Jan. 19, new users wont be able to download it and updates wont be available. That will eventually render the app unworkable, the Justice Department has said in court filings. The decision came against the backdrop of unusual political agitation by President-elect Donald Trump, who vowed that he could negotiate a solution and the administration of President Joe Biden, which has signaled it wont enforce the law beginning Sunday, his final full day in office. Trump, mindful of TikToks popularity, and his own 14.7 million followers on the app, finds himself on the opposite side of the argument from prominent Senate Republicans who fault TikToks Chinese owner for not finding a buyer before now. Trump said in a Truth Social post shortly before the decision was issued that TikTok was among the topics in his conversation Friday with Chinese leader Xi Jinping. Its unclear what options are open to Trump once he is sworn in as president on Monday. The law allowed for a 90-day pause in the restrictions on the app if there had been progress toward a sale before it took effect. Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar, who defended the law at the Supreme Court for the Democratic Biden administration, told the justices last week that its uncertain whether the prospect of a sale once the law is in effect could trigger a 90-day respite for TikTok. Congress has determined that divestiture is necessary to address its well-supported national security concerns regarding TikToks data collection practices and relationship with a foreign adversary, the court said in an unsigned opinion, adding that the law does not violate petitioners First Amendment rights. Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Neil Gorsuch filed short separate opinions noting some reservations about the courts decision but going along with the outcome. Without doubt, the remedy Congress and the President chose here is dramatic, Gorsuch wrote. Still, he said he was persuaded by the argument that China could get access to vast troves of personal information about tens of millions of Americans. Some digital rights groups slammed the courts ruling shortly after it was released. Todays unprecedented decision upholding the TikTok ban harms the free expression of hundreds of millions of TikTok users in this country and around the world, said Kate Ruane, a director at the Washington-based Center for Democracy  Technology, which has supported TikToks challenge to the federal law. Content creators who opposed the law also worried about the effect on their business if TikTok shuts down. Im very, very concerned about whats going to happen over the next couple weeks, said Desiree Hill, owner of Crowns Corner mechanic shop in Conyers, Georgia. And very scared about the decrease that Im going to have in reaching customers and worried Im going to potentially lose my business in the next six months. At arguments, the justices were told by a lawyer for TikTok and ByteDance Ltd., the Chinese technology company that is its parent, how difficult it would be to consummate a deal, especially since Chinese law restricts the sale of the proprietary algorithm that has made the social media platform wildly successful. The app allows users to watch hundreds of videos in about half an hour because some are only a few seconds long, according to a lawsuit filed last year by Kentucky complaining that TikTok is designed to be addictive and harms kids mental health. Similar suits were filed by more than a dozen states. TikTok has called the claims inaccurate. The dispute over TikToks ties to China has come to embody the geopolitical competition between Washington and Beijing. ByteDance and its Chinese Communist masters had nine months to sell TikTok before the Sunday deadline, Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., wrote on X. The very fact that Communist China refuses to permit its sale reveals exactly what TikTok is: a communist spy app. The Supreme Court correctly rejected TikToks lies and propaganda masquerading as legal arguments. The U.S. has said its concerned about TikTok collecting vast swaths of user data, including sensitive information on viewing habits, that could fall into the hands of the Chinese government through coercion. Officials have also warned the algorithm that fuels what users see on the app is vulnerable to manipulation by Chinese authorities, who can use it to shape content on the platform in a way thats difficult to detect. TikTok points out the U.S. has not presented evidence that China has attempted to manipulate content on its U.S. platform or gather American user data through TikTok. Bipartisan majorities in Congress passed legislation and Biden signed it into law in April. The law was the culmination of a yearslong saga in Washington over TikTok, which the government sees as a national security threat. TikTok, which sued the government last year over the law, has long denied it could be used as a tool of Beijing. A three-judge panel made up of two Republican appointees and a Democratic appointee unanimously upheld the law in December, prompting TikToks quick appeal to the Supreme Court. Without a sale to an approved buyer, the law bars app stores operated by Apple, Google and others from offering TikTok beginning on Sunday. Internet hosting services also will be prohibited from hosting TikTok. ByteDance has said it wont sell. But some investors have been eyeing it, including Trumps former Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and billionaire businessman Frank McCourt. McCourts Project Liberty initiative has said it and its unnamed partners have presented a proposal to ByteDance to acquire TikToks U.S. assets. The consortium, which includes Shark Tank host Kevin OLeary, did not disclose the financial terms of the offer. McCourt, in a statement following the ruling, said his group was ready to work with the company and President Trump to complete a deal. Prelogar told the justices last week that having the law take effect might be just the jolt ByteDance needs to reconsider its position. Source: AP --Agencies",

        "title": "Israeli cabinet approves Gaza ceasefire accord, due to take effect Sunday",
        "date": "January 18, 2025 07:46 am",
        "content": "Israels cabinet approved a deal with Palestinian militant group Hamas for a ceasefire and release of hostages in the Gaza Strip, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahus office said on Saturday, a day ahead of the agreements scheduled start. In the early hours of Saturday after meeting for more than six hours, the government ratified the agreement that could pave the way for an end to the 15-month-old war in the Palestinian enclave, which Hamas controls. The Government has approved the framework for the return of the hostages. The framework for the hostages release will come into effect on Sunday, Netanyahus office said in a brief statement. In Gaza itself, Israeli warplanes have kept up heavy attacks since the ceasefire deal was agreed. Medics in Gaza said an Israeli airstrike early on Saturday killed five people in a tent in the Mawasi area west of Khan Younis in the enclaves south. This brought to 119 the number of Palestinians killed by Israeli bombardment since the accord was announced on Wednesday. After the Israeli cabinet approval, lead U.S. negotiator Brett McGurk said the plan was moving forward on track. The White House expects the ceasefire to start on Sunday morning, with three female hostages to be released to Israel on Sunday afternoon through the Red Cross. We have locked down every single detail in this agreement. We are quite confident... it is ready to be implemented on Sunday, McGurk said on CNN from the White House. Under the deal, the three-stage ceasefire starts with an initial six-week phase when hostages held by Hamas will be exchanged for prisoners detained by Israel. Thirty-three of the 98 remaining Israeli hostages, including women, children, and men over 50, were due to be freed in this phase. Israel will release all Palestinian women and children under 19 in Israeli jails by the end of the first phase. The names of 95 Palestinian prisoners to be turned over on Sunday were announced by the Israeli Justice Ministry on Friday. After Sundays hostage release, McGurk said the accord called for four more female hostages to be released after seven days followed by the release of three further hostages every seven days thereafter. HARDLINERS OPPOSE CEASEFIRE With the accord bitterly opposed by some Israeli cabinet hardliners, media reports said 24 ministers in Netanyahus coalition government voted in favour of the deal while eight opposed it. The opponents said the ceasefire agreement represented a capitulation to Hamas. National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir threatened to resign if it was approved and urged other ministers to vote against it. However, he said he would not bring down the government. His fellow hardliner, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, also threatened to quit the government if it does not go back to war to defeat Hamas after the first six-week phase of the ceasefire. After a last-minute delay on Thursday that Israel blamed on Hamas, the Israeli security cabinet voted on Friday in favour of the ceasefire accord, the first of two approvals required. Israel began its assault on Gaza after Hamas attacks on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023 during which some 1,200 people were killed and 250 were taken hostage, according to Israeli tallies. The war between Israeli forces and Hamas has razed much of heavily urbanised Gaza, killed more than 46,000 people and displaced most of the enclaves pre-war population of 2.3 million several times over, according to local authorities. If successful, the ceasefire could also ease hostilities in the Middle East, where the Gaza war spread to include Iran and its proxies - Lebanons Hezbollah, Yemens Houthis and armed groups in Iraq as well as the occupied West Bank. Gaza civilians have faced a humanitarian crisis due to hunger, cold and sickness. The ceasefire agreement calls for a surge in assistance, and international organisations have aid trucks lined up on Gazas borders to bring in food, fuel, medicine and other vital supplies. Palestinian relief agency UNRWA said on Friday that it has 4,000 truckloads of aid, half of which are food, ready to enter the coastal strip. Palestinians waiting for food in the southern Gaza Strip on Friday said they hoped a truce will mean an end to hours of queuing to fill one plate. I hope it will happen so well be able to cook in our homes and make whatever food we want, without having to go to soup kitchens and exhaust ourselves for three or four hours trying to get (food) - sometimes not even making it home, displaced Palestinian Reeham Sheikh al-Eid said.
