        "title": "Susan Wojcicki, former YouTube CEO and longtime Google executive, has died at 56",
        "date": "August 11, 2024 06:07 pm",
        "content": "Susan Wojcicki, a pioneering tech executive who helped shape Google and YouTube, has died, her husband said. She was 56. Wojcicki played a key role in Googles creation and served nine years as YouTubes CEO, stepping down last year to focus on her family, health, and personal projects Im passionate about, she said at the time. She was one of the most respected female executives in the male-dominated tech industry. Her collaboration with Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin began shortly after they incorporated their search engine into a business in 1998. Wojcicki rented the garage of her Menlo Park, California, home to them for 1,700 a month, cementing a formative partnership. Page and Brin  both 25 at the time  continued to refine their search engine in Wojcickis garage for five months before moving Google into a more formal office and later persuaded their former landlord to come work for their company. Wojcicki joined Google, now known as Alphabet, as its marketing manager in 1999 and served in various positions as Google grew its online advertising presence by acquiring YouTube in 2006 and DoubleClick in 2008. She served as Googles senior vice president of advertising and commerce from 2011 to early 2014 and CEO of YouTube from 2014 to 2023. Her loss is devastating for all of us who know and love her, for the thousands of Googlers she led over the years, and for millions of people all over the world who looked up to her, benefited from her advocacy and leadership, and felt the impact of the incredible things she created at Google, YouTube, and beyond, Google and Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai said in a note to employees. Former Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg, who was vice president of Googles sales and operations from 2001 to 2008 before decamping to Facebook, said in a Facebook post that Wojcicki was formative in her tech career. She taught me the business and helped me navigate a growing, fairly chaotic organization at the beginning of my career in tech, Sandberg wrote. She was the person I turned to for advice over and over again. And she was this person for so many others too. Her husband, Dennis Troper, announced her death in a social media post late Friday. My beloved wife of 26 years and mother to our five children left us today after 2 years of living with non small cell lung cancer, he wrote. Susan was not just my best friend and partner in life, but a brilliant mind, a loving mother, and a dear friend to many, Troper said. No other details of her death were immediately provided. Wojcicki and Tropers 19-year-old son, Marco Troper, died in February at the UC Berkeley campus where he resided as a freshman student. Source: AP --Agencies",

        "title": "Donald Trumps campaign says its emails were hacked by Iran",
        "date": "August 11, 2024 06:20 pm",
        "content": "Former President Donald Trumps presidential campaign said Saturday that it has been hacked and suggested Iranian actors were involved in stealing and distributing sensitive internal documents. The campaign provided no specific evidence of Irans involvement, but the claim comes a day after Microsoft issued a report detailing foreign agents attempts to interfere in the U.S. campaign in 2024. It cited an instance of an Iranian military intelligence unit in June sending a spear-phishing email to a high-ranking official of a presidential campaign from a compromised email account of a former senior advisor. Trump campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung blamed the hack on foreign sources hostile to the United States. A spokesperson for the National Security Council said in a statement that it takes any report of improper foreign interference extremely seriously and condemns any government or entity that attempts to undermine confidence in U.S. democratic institutions, but said it deferred to the Justice Department on this matter. Irans mission to the United Nations, when asked about the claim of the Trump campaign, denied being involved. We do not accord any credence to such reports, the mission told The Associated Press. The Iranian government neither possesses nor harbors any intent or motive to interfere in the United States presidential election. However, Iran long has been suspected of running hacking campaigns targeting its enemies in the Middle East and beyond. Tehran also long has threatened to retaliate against Trump over the 2020 drone strike he ordered that killed prominent Revolutionary Guard Gen. Qassem Soleimani. The U.S. Justice Department this past week unsealed criminal charges against a Pakistani national with ties to Iran alleged to have plotted assassination attempts against political figures in the United States, including potentially Trump, and to have sought to hire purported hitmen who were actually undercover law enforcement officials. Court documents in that case pointedly noted a desire by Iran to conduct operations against perceived enemies of the regime and to avenge the killing of Soleimani. Politico first reported Saturday on the hack. The outlet reported that it began receiving emails on July 22 from an anonymous account. The source  an AOL email account identified only as Robert  passed along what appeared to be a research dossier the campaign had apparently done on the Republican vice presidential nominee, Ohio Sen. JD Vance. The document was dated Feb. 23, almost five months before Trump selected Vance as his running mate. These documents were obtained illegally and intended to interfere with the 2024 election and sow chaos throughout our Democratic process, Cheung said. He pointed to the Microsoft report issued Friday and its conclusions that Iranian hackers broke into the account of a high ranking official on the U.S. presidential campaign in June 2024, which coincides with the close timing of President Trumps selection of a vice presidential nominee. The Iranians know that President Trump will stop their reign of terror just like he did in his first four years in the White House, Cheung said, adding a warning that any media or news outlet reprinting documents or internal communications are doing the bidding of Americas enemies and doing exactly what they want. Cheung did not immediately respond to questions about the campaigns interactions with Microsoft on the matter. Microsoft said Saturday it had no comment beyond its blog post and Friday report. In that report, Microsoft stated that foreign malign influence concerning the 2024 US election started off slowly but has steadily picked up pace over the last six months due initially to Russian operations, but more recently from Iranian activity. The analysis continued: Iranian cyber-enabled influence operations have been a consistent feature of at least the last three U.S. election cycles. Irans operations have been notable and distinguishable from Russian campaigns for appearing later in the election season and employing cyberattacks more geared toward election conduct than swaying voters. Recent activity suggests the Iranian regime  along with the Kremlin  may be equally engaged in election 2024, Microsoft concluded. Specifically, the report detailed that in June 2024, an Iranian military intelligence unit, Mint Sandstorm, sent a phishing email to an American presidential campaign via the compromised account of a former adviser. The phishing email contained a fake forward with a hyperlink that directs traffic through an actor-controlled domain before redirecting to the listed domain, the report states. Vice President Kamala Harris campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the reported hacking or on the Democratic nominees cybersecurity protocols. Source: AP --Agencies",

        "title": "Perseid meteor shower: Sri Lankas northern sky to dazzle with midnight light show tonight",
        "date": "August 11, 2024 06:43 pm",
        "content": "The most anticipated meteor shower of the year- the Perseids - will be visible to Sri Lanka tonight (11), after midnight or pre-dawn light hours. Space Scientist Gihan Weerasekara said this dazzling display will clearly appear to naked-eye from a plain ground on the northern sky of Sri Lanka from 12.00 midnight until the dawn. Streams of light and color will travel across the sky while explosions of fireballs linger, leaving behind even brighter streaks than the meteor trails from the Perseids passing through the atmosphere. Visible annually from mid-July to September 1, the Perseid meteor shower is set to peak between Sunday and before dawn Monday this year. Up to 100 meteors are expected per hour, moving at a speed of 133,200 miles per hour (214,365 kilometers per hour), as per reports. The meteor showers name comes from the location in the sky that it appears to originate from  whats called the radiant  near the constellation Perseus. The constellation can be identified with a stargazing app, which can help viewers pinpoint the showers starting point. Bill Cooke, head of NASAs Meteoroid Environment Office, described the Perseids as the richest meteor shower of the year because of the bright fireballs. Its the closest thing each year to a celestial fireworks display, Cooke said. How to view the Perseids NASAs Cooke recommends four tips for optimal viewing. You dont need instruments such as a telescope or binoculars, but find the darkest sky you can without light pollution. If you can, lie flat on your back and look straight up, taking in as much sky as possible. Give your eyes 30 to 45 minutes to adapt to the dark. Dont look at your cell phone, because that screen ruins your night vision, and it takes your eyes off the sky, Cooke said. The best time to view the shower is after midnight around 2 a.m., when the source of the meteors will be the highest in the northeastern sky, both experts said. Mother Nature doesnt respect peoples sleep, Cooke joked. --With agencies inputs",

Issuing a statement, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said that ratified by all States, the Geneva Conventions of 1949 embody the universal recognition that wars must have limits, and that, regardless of the circumstances, the actions of parties to an armed conflict must be guided by respect for human dignity and compassion. The Geneva Conventions form the core of international humanitarian law which protects people who are not, or are no longer, taking part in the fighting. They represent a shared interest in a humanitarian imperative to regulate the behaviour of warring parties and to set limits to violence in war. In the context of the devasting humanitarian impact of armed conflicts and polarised public opinion, this unique consensus must be embraced, not cast aside, it added. Meanwhile, to mark this significant milestone, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs - Sri Lanka, the Embassy of Switzerland to Sri Lanka and the Maldives and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) are organizing an event, themed 75 Years of the Geneva Conventions: Global and Sri Lankan Perspectives on 14 August 2024 in Colombo.

A panel discussion is also scheduled to take place at the event with the participation of experts in international humanitarian law, on Preserving our shared humanity: IHL as a national and international political priority, the ICRC mentioned. Additionally, a photo exhibition will be unveiled at the BMICH, showcasing historical and contemporary perspectives on the Geneva Conventions and Sri Lankas contributions to the development of IHL.

        "date": "August 12, 2024 11:27 am",
        "content": "Moscow and Kyiv accused each other of starting a fire on the grounds of Europes largest and now Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine on Sunday, with both sides reporting no sign of elevated radiation. The U.N.s International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) nuclear watchdog, which has a presence at the vast six-reactor facility, said its experts had seen strong, dark smoke coming from the northern area of the plant in southern Ukraine following multiple explosions. These reckless attacks endanger nuclear safety at the plant and increase the risk of a nuclear accident. They must stop now, IAEA chief Rafael Grossi warned in a separate statement, without attributing blame for the attack. The fire comes less than a week after Ukraines forces launched their largest incursion into Russian territory since the war-start in 2022, a surprise move that has brought conflict into a new phase, after weeks of Moscows battlefield gains. Russian state news agencies, TASS and RIA, cited the countrys nuclear energy company Rosatom as saying the main fire was extinguished shortly before midnight on Sunday. RIA, citing Rosatom, said a drone attack started the fire at the cooling tower, without providing evidence. Ukraines nuclear power company Energoatom said in a statement on the Telegram messaging app that one of the cooling towers and other equipment were damaged. Russias TASS agency also reported, citing Rosatoms statement, that a cooling tower was damaged. Citing local Russian emergency ministry representatives, TASS said it was a non-functioning tower. Grossi said the agency requested immediate access to the cooling tower to assess the damage. There was no immediate response from Moscow or Kyiv to Grossis statement. Russia captured the plant from Ukraine shortly after launching its full-scale invasion on its smaller neighbour in 2022, an attack described by Moscow as a special operation. The plants six nuclear reactors are in cold shutdown. TRADING BLAME By early Monday, it was not clear what caused the fire that started at around 8 p.m. (1700 GMT) on Sunday. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy accused Russia of lighting the fire which he said was visible from the Kyiv-held city of Nikopol, which looks out onto the Russian-held plant. The IAEA said there had been no reported impact on nuclear safety at the site. Team was told by (the nuclear plant) of an alleged drone attack today on one of the cooling towers located at the site, it wrote on X. Ukraines Energoatom said Russias negligence or arson could have sparked the fire. Without providing evidence, it also said Russia uses the plants cooling towers to store military equipment and explosives. Russias officials in turn, including Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, Maria Zakharova, accused Kyiv of deliberately trying to destroy the plant and sow nuclear terror. Zelenskiy published grainy video showing belching black smoke that appeared to be coming out a cooling tower with a blaze burning at its foot. Currently, the radiation indicators are normal. But as long as Russian terrorists retain control over the nuclear plant, the situation is not and cannot be normal, he said. The six reactors at the plant located close to the front line of the war in Ukraine are not in operation but the facility relies on external power to keep its nuclear material cool and prevent a catastrophic accident. Moscow and Kyiv have routinely accused each other of endangering safety around it. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

On July 25, MP Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe officially announced that he would contest the upcoming Presidential Election while he stepped down from his ministerial position as the Minister of Justice, Prisons Affairs and Constitutional Reforms on July 29.",

The storm, packing maximum wind speeds of 72 kph (45 mph), is expected to move towards the Sea of Japan. The Japan Meteorological Agency warned of risks from mudslides and floods after record-breaking rainfall over the last two days in some cities of the region. The government will do its best to tackle the situation, Prime Minister Fumio Kishida told reporters. Well continue to provide information to residents and support those evacuating, he said. Although Japan is observing a holiday, some high-speed bullet trains and regular services have been suspended in Iwate and other northern areas, while Japan Airlines and All Nippon Airways also cancelled flights with the affected regions.

        "date": "August 12, 2024 02:01 pm",
        "content": "Sri Lankas talismanic skipper Chamari Athapaththu beat a hot field by overcoming Indias star openers, Smriti Mandhana and Shafali Verma, to win the ICC Womens Player of the Month for July 2024. July was prolific for the southpaw, who secured new landmarks. Athapaththu led Sri Lanka to a maiden Womens Asia Cup 2024 title over seven-time champions India during the month. This is the third ICC Womens Player of the Month award for the 34-year-old, making her the joint second-most successful cricketer in the Womens Player of the Month arena, tied at three awards with West Indies Hayley Matthews, sitting behind Australias Ashleigh Gardner (four wins). I am happy and honored to have been chosen as the ICC Womens Player of the Month for the third time and it is heartening to see such reckoning for the efforts of mine, achieved with the support of my teammates and coaches, being continuously recognised by the cricketing world, she said. I believe these recognitions will send a positive message to thousands of girls who are already playing cricket in my country and also elsewhere and want to play for their country; that commitment and dedication for the game will one day pay off. This triumph was yet another feat under Athapaththus command in recent times. Over the last 12 months, Sri Lanka have set several milestones under her leadership including first-ever T20I series wins against England and South Africa. Sri Lanka also featured in the ICC Womens T20 World Cup Qualifier 2024 in April-May of 2024 in Abu Dhabi and won all their games to qualify for the global mega event in October. But July was all about Athapaththus contribution to the historic Womens Asia Cup triumph. She starred with the willow in their undefeated run in the tournament. After making just 12 in Sri Lankas first game against Bangladesh, Athapaththu responded in style, hitting a career-best 119 against Malaysia. An unbeaten 49 against Thailand in the final group game was followed by back-to-back and match-winning fifties against Pakistan (63) and India (61) in the tournament semi-final and final. Her 304 runs at a healthy strike rate of 146.85 wouldve been enough to secure a Player of the Tournament award, but the skipper also struck three times with the ball, including in the final against India. --ICC--",

        "date": "August 12, 2024 02:53 pm",
        "content": "The Acting General Secretary of the Parliament Chaminda Kularatne has informed the Chairman of the Election Commission in writing that two Parliamentary seats in the Ninth Parliament have become vacant from the 09 August 2024 due to the cancellation of the parliamentary seats of Manusha Nanayakkara and Harin Fernando. This has been informed in terms of the Sections 64(1) and 64(5) of the Parliamentary Elections Act No. 1 of 1981, the Parliamentary Communications Department said. On 09 August 2024, the Supreme Court determined that the Samagi Jana Balawegayas (SJB) decision to expel Galle District Member of Parliament Manusha Nanayakkara and the National List Member of Parliament Harin Fernando from the party is legally valid. As a result, the two Parliamentary seats became vacant. The Supreme Court declared this ruling while dismissing the petitions filed by the Minister Harin Fernando and Minister Manusha Nanayakkkara challenging the SJBs decision to remove them from their party membership. On July 18, 2023, the Working Committee of the SJB decided to expel party members Harin Fernando and Manusha Nanayakkara from the party. In May 2022, the SJB had suspended the party membership of the two parliamentarians after they had accepted ministerial portfolios in the government while the party had vowed to take disciplinary action against them. However, the General Secretary of Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) Ranjith Madduma Bandara stated that party member Bandulal Bandarigoda will be appointed fill the parliamentary seat which fell vacant following the suspension of the party membership of Manusha Nanayakkara through a Supreme Court ruling. Bandarigoda, who secured 34,897 votes and the third place from the Galle District in 2020 General Election, is next in line on SJBs preferential vote list. Meanwhile, he also said a qualified individual will be named by the SJB to fill the MP seat which remains vacant as Harin Fernando was also disqualified to hold the MP seat due to the suspension of his party membership, since Fernando was elected to the Parliament through SJBs national list.",

        "content": "MP Wimal Weerawansa has filed a case against two officers of the Immigration and Emigration Department before the Colombo District Court seeking Rs. 1,000 million as compensation for alleged defamation. The former minister says he was arrested under the Immigration and Emigration Act for no reason during the previous Yahapalana (good governance) government and a case was filed before the Negombo Magistrates Court, and that this had harmed his reputation. In this case which was filed today (12), the authorized officer of the Immigration and Emigration Department Eranga Rambukwella, senior authorized officer Sujeewa Rathnayake and the Attorney General have been named as respondents. In 2015, Weerawansa was accused of using an expired passport to fly abroad while the MP was preparing to travel to Europe for a series of lectures, following an invitation from Sri Lankan expatriates in Dubai and Italy. However, the MP had claimed that upon arriving at the airport he realized that the passport in his possession was one that he had lost and later found after obtaining a new passport. Weerawansa claims he was arrested by the officers of the Criminal Investigation Department without any reasonable cause and was released on bail after being produced before the Negombo Magistrates Court. In relation to that, the MP pointed out that the court acquitted him of all charges after nearly 09 years of hearing the case filed against him under the Immigration and Emigration Act. Accordingly, he has filed this case demanding a compensation of Rs. 1, 000 million from the respondents for the defamation caused by maliciously arresting him and prosecuting him without conducting a fair investigation.",

        "date": "August 12, 2024 04:29 pm",
        "content": "A fast-moving wildfire fuelled by gale-force winds spread to the edge of Athens on Monday, torching trees, houses and cars and forcing evacuations of several hospitals and a dozen towns and villages, Greek authorities said. Hundreds of wildfires have broken out across Greece since May. While summer fires are common in Greece, extraordinarily hot and dry weather linked to climate change have made blazes more frequent and intense. Wildfires fanned by extreme heat have also raged this month in parts of Spain and the Balkans. More than 670 firefighters backed by volunteers, 183 fire engines, 32 waterbombing planes and helicopters battled the latest wildfire that broke out at 3 p.m. (midday GMT) on Sunday near Varnavas 35 km (20 miles) north of the capital. By Monday the conflagration, the worst in Greece this year, had advanced to the village of Grammatiko, the seaside municipality of Nea Makri and the fringes of Athens densely populated northern suburbs at the heavily wooded Mount Penteli. It hurts, we have grown up in this forest. We feel great sadness and anger, 24-year old Penteli resident Marina Kalogerakou told Reuters outside her home, which the flames had nearly reached. Strong winds were constantly changing the direction of the fire and the extent of the area engulfed by flames was estimated at 30 km (18.64 miles). Winds were expected to pick up further in the coming hours, aggravating the blaze, said Theodore Giannaros, researcher at the National Observatory of Athens. We have a very difficult day ahead of us, he told state TV ERT. Firefighting aircraft resumed operations early on Monday after an overnight pause. Police said they had helped evacuate at least 250 people in danger. Some residents spent the night in shelters but authorities could not yet provide an exact number. At least three hospitals and several communities had been evacuated in the Penteli area. The blaze, with flames as high as 25 metres (82 feet), had spread like lightning due to gale-force winds, fire brigade spokesperson Vassilis Vathrakogiannis said on Sunday. Thick clouds of smoke darkened the sky over Athens by Sunday evening. Hours later, the flames were nearing the residential suburb of Dionysos about 23 km (14 miles) northeast of the city centre, and nearby districts. Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis visited the fire brigades operations centre on Monday morning after rushing back from a holiday break on the island of Crete - with memories still fresh of a 2018 fire that killed 104 people in the seaside town of Mati, near the capital. After its warmest winter on record and long periods of little or no rainfall, Greece is forecast to record its hottest-ever summer. It is on high fire alert at least until Thursday with temperatures forecast at up to 40 Celsius (104 Fahrenheit). Unfortunately the forecasts...were confirmed, Climate Crisis and Civil Protection Minister Vassilis Kikilias said in a televised statement. The states response was immediate, he said, and the first aircraft were operating five minutes after the wildfire broke out. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "title": "From Paris to Los Angeles: How the city is preparing for the 2028 Olympics",
        "date": "August 12, 2024 05:39 pm",
        "content": "Its Los Angeles turn for the torch. Mayor Karen Bass accepted the Olympic flag at the Paris closing ceremony Sunday, before handing it off to a key representative of LAs local business  Tom Cruise  who in a pre-recorded trek via motorcycle, plane and parachute kicked off the countdown to 2028. The city will become the third in the world to host the games three times as it adds to the storied years of 1932 and 1984. Heres a look forward and back in time at the Olympics in LA. Los Angeles got the 2028 games as a consolation prize when Paris was picked for 2024. Back in 1932, LA hosted its first Olympics. The city was the only bidder for the games at a time marred by the Great Depression and the absence of several nations. Yet memorable sport moments came from athletes including American athlete Babe Didrikson Zaharias, who won golds in the new womens events of javelin and hurdles. Financial and cultural success gave 1984 a reputation as the good Olympics which made seemingly every major world city want their own. Emphasizing both the modern and the classical with a hand from Hollywood, the games opened with decathlon champion Rafer Johnson lighting the torch, a guy in a jetpack descending into the Memorial Coliseum and theme music by Star Wars maestro John Williams. With Eastern Bloc countries boycotting, the U.S. dominated. Carl Lewis and Mary Lou Retton are among the athletes who became household names. A young Michael Jordan led the mens basketball team to gold. The games renewed, for a while, the global reputation of a city that had been perceived to be in decline. We want our games to be a modern games, youthful, full of the optimism that Southern California brings to the world and the globe, Janet Evans, four-time Olympic gold medalist in swimming and chief athlete officer for the LA 2028 organizing committee, told The Associated Press in Paris. Bass, who arrives back in LA Monday, spent these games in Paris along with organizers and city officials, learning what it takes to host the worlds largest sporting event. Joining her were LA28 Chairperson Casey Wasserman, an entertainment executive, and LA councilmember Traci Park, chair of the city Olympic committee. As weve seen here in Paris, the Olympics are an opportunity to make transformative change, Bass said at a press conference ahead of the closing ceremony. Amid a stadium-and-arena boom, LA will polish existing structures rather than erect new ones. Its a no-build games, Evans said. After Paris innovative opening ceremony on the Seine River, LA plans to open with a traditional, stadium-based approach at SoFi Stadium in neighboring Inglewood that also incorporates the century-old Memorial Coliseum in Los Angeles itself. Home to two NFL teams, SoFi has hosted a Super Bowl and several Taylor Swift concerts since opening in 2020. It will become what organizers say is the largest Olympic swimming venue ever. Its opening ceremony role means swimming will come after track and field for the first time since 1972. Intuit Dome, the soon-to-open Inglewood home of the NBAs Clippers, would be the games newest major venue and is the planned home for Olympic basketball. The Lakers downtown Crypto.com Arena will host gymnastics. The toxicity of swimming in the Seine became a serious issue in Paris. That could put renewed focus on the Long Beach area waterfront when it hosts marathon swimming and triathlon races. Its cleanliness history is mixed but its ocean waters got consistently high marks in a 2023 analysis by nonprofit Heal the Bay. The Long Beach shore was home to the pre-recorded performances during Sundays ceremony of the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Billie Eilish, Snoop Dogg and Dr. Dre, though it was easy to mistake for LAs Venice Beach, where the journey of the flag begun by Cruise was shown ending moments earlier. A city thats notoriously hard to traverse may seem like an odd fit for the Olympics, but it can work. Bass said she plans to emulate the tactics of Tom Bradley, the mayor in 1984, whose traffic mitigations had some saying it was better than at non-Olympic times. They include asking local businesses to stagger workforce hours to reduce the number of cars on the road and allow work from home during the 17-day games. Landing the Olympics under then-Mayor Eric Garcetti in 2017 gave the city an unusually long lead time for planning. While its no Paris Metro, LA has built a subway since its last Olympics, with lines running past major venues. In 2018, the city planned an ambitious slate of 28 bus and rail projects to transform public transit. Some were scrapped but others moved forward, including the extension of a subway line to connect downtown Los Angeles with UCLA, the planned home of the Olympic Village. Another high-profile project is the Inglewood People Mover, an automated, three-stop rail line past major Olympic venues. It initially received a commitment of 1 billion in federal funding, but opposition from Democratic Rep. Maxine Waters led to a 200 million reduction, the Los Angeles Times reported. Its unclear whether the line will be completed by 2028. Metro recently received 900 million in funding through an infrastructure spending package and grants from the Biden administration, of which 139 million will go directly toward improving transportation by 2028 and the goal of a car-free Olympics. The biggest challenge is not waiting to 2028, but really taking the opportunity between now and 2028 to help Angelenos and visitors alike reimagine the transportation network as something that will be their first choice, Metro CEO Stephanie Wiggins said. While crime rates were considerably higher in 1984 than today, the countdown to 2028 comes as the issue has gotten increased attention and cast a social-media-amplified shadow. The Olympics are designated as a national special security event, which makes the U.S. Secret Service the lead agency tasked with developing a security plan, supported by significant federal resources. LA city and county law enforcement sent officers to Paris to observe, learn and assist as they prepare for their own 2028 games. There are many more encampments on city streets than there were in 1984, and its unlikely LA will have solved its homeless crisis in the next four years. As the Paris games ended, California Gov. Gavin Newsom threatened to withhold funding from cities unable to clear encampments. Ahead of the Games in Paris, organizers relocated thousands of unhoused people, a practice also used for the 2016 Rio de Janiero games and criticized by activists as social cleansing. LA is the next logical destination for the Olympics, said Adam Burke, president and CEO of the LA Tourism and Convention Board. LA has emerged as really one of the worlds sports capitals. First though, the city will host a FIFA World Cup event and U.S. Womens Open in 2026 and another Super Bowl in 2027. The citys hotel industry has continued to see growth, adding 9,000 new hotel rooms in the past four years with more to come over the next four. LA28 organizers are banking on ticket sales, sponsorships, payments from the International Olympic Committee and other revenue streams to cover the games 6.9 billion budget. The committee has brought in just over 1 billion toward a goal of 2.5 billion in domestic corporate sponsorships. Source: ABC News --Agencies",

        "content": "Cricketer M S Dhoni-backed drone technology firm Garuda Aerospace on Monday announced its entry in the Sri Lankan market where it will primarily target agricultural sector to enhance farming practices, besides exploring opportunities in homeland security and industrial applications. As part of the companys global expansion plans, the foray into Sri Lanka will also support Garuda in capitalising on the countrys strategic location and drone-friendly regulatory environment, Garuda Aerospace said. The company said it is looking to spread its presence in at least 50 countries over the next few years, and has set aside USD 10 million, of the over Rs 100 crore revenue it delivered in FY24, to fuel the international growth. This (expansion into Sri Lanka) isnt merely about growth, its about unlocking the full potential of drone technology to create substantial impacts across various sectors. Sri Lankas diverse landscape allows us to showcase how our innovative solutions can bring tangible benefits, from agriculture to infrastructure, said Agnishwar Jayaprakash, Founder and CEO of Garuda Aerospace. Garuda Aerospace, which produces small and medium category drones, had partnered with Greek manufacturer Spirit Aeronautical Systems early this year. It has also signed a pact with French aerospace giant Thales to promote growth and innovation in Indias drone sector. Spirit Aeronautical specialises in rotary and fixed-wing weaponised drones.

        "content": "More than 47,000 people died in Europe due to scorching temperatures in 2023, with countries in the regions south hit the hardest, according to a report by the Barcelona Institute for Global Health (ISGlobal) published on Monday. Last year was the worlds hottest on record. As climate change continues to increase temperatures, Europeans live in the worlds fastest-warming continent, facing growing health risks stemming from intense heat. The 2023 death toll - below the more than 60,000 heat-related deaths estimated for the previous year - would have been 80 higher without measures introduced in the past 20 years to help people adapt to rising temperatures, such as early warning systems and healthcare improvements, according to the report by the Spanish research centre. Our results show how there have been societal adaptation processes to high temperatures during the present century, which have dramatically reduced the heat-related vulnerability and mortality burden of recent summers, especially among the elderly, said Elisa Gallo, researcher at ISGlobal and lead author of the study. Researchers used death and temperature records from 35 European countries. They estimate that 47,690 died from causes related to high temperatures. Adjusting the data for population, Greece, Bulgaria, Italy and Spain were the countries with the highest mortality rates related to heat. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "title": "Rambling Trump, Musk interview marred by tech issues",
        "date": "August 13, 2024 10:04 am",
        "content": "Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump sat Monday for a friendly two-hour interview with billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk on Musks social media platform X, after technical problems delayed the start of the event for more than 40 minutes. Musk, who has endorsed Trump, blamed the difficulties on a distributed denial-of-service attack, in which a server or network is flooded with traffic in an attempt to shut it down, though his claim could not be verified. Trump sought to turn the problems into a positive, congratulating Musk on the number of people trying to tune in. A counter on X showed as many as 1.3 million people were listening at times during the lengthy conversation. The technical issues recalled a similar event on X in May 2023, when Florida Governor Ron DeSantis suffered a chaotic start to his bid for the Republican presidential nomination due to glitches on the platform. At the time, Trump mocked DeSantis on his own, social media platform, Truth Social. My Red Button is bigger, better, stronger, and is working (TRUTH!) Trump posted, Yours does not. Ahead of Mondays event, Musk had written: Am going to do some system scaling tests tonight  tomorrow in advance of the conversation. X did not respond to requests for details or evidence of the alleged cyberattack. The two men exchanged praise repeatedly, with the Tesla (TSLA.O), opens new tab chief lauding Trump for his bravery during the attempt on his life last month, and Trump congratulating Musk for his willingness to fire workers demanding better conditions. Youre the greatest cutter, Trump said. I mean, I look at what you do. You walk in, you just say: You want to quit? They go on strike - I wont mention the name of the company - but they go on strike. And you say: Thats okay, youre all gone. Musk, the worlds richest person, announced his support for Trump shortly after his attempted assassination, despite the Republicans opposition to state support for electric carmakers like Tesla. Musk backed Democratic President Joe Biden in 2020 but has tacked rightward since. I think were at a fork in the road of destiny, of civilization, and I think we need to take the right path, and I think youre the right path, he told Trump as the interview concluded. The chat with Musk offered Trump an unfiltered chance to air his usual mix of grievances, personal attacks and overstated or false claims. Musk let Trump lead the conversation and did not challenge Trumps inaccurate statements, like the assertion that other countries were sending criminals from their prisons across the southern U.S. border, or that bacon prices had risen four or five times. Studies show immigrants, including those in the U.S. illegally, do not commit crimes at a higher rate than native-born Americans. The talk was Trumps latest effort to seize the spotlight from his Democratic rival, Vice President Kamala Harris, whose 11th-hour entry into the race has galvanized her party and boosted Democratic fundraising. Harris has dominated headlines with a series of high-energy rallies since she replaced Biden as the partys candidate three weeks ago. Her momentum could get another boost from the Democratic National Convention next week in Chicago. In a statement after the interview, a Harris campaign spokesperson, Joseph Costello, said: Trumps entire campaign is in service of people like Elon Musk and himself  self-obsessed rich guys who will sell out the middle class and who cannot run a livestream in the year 2024. The former president sounded at several points as if he had a lisp, something many listeners noted on X. The Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment about Trumps speech. HARRIS MOMENTUM Trump insulted Harris several times, referring to her as third rate, incompetent and a radical left lunatic. But then he praised her looks. She looks like the most beautiful actress ever to live, Trump said about a picture of Harris on the cover of Time magazine. It was a drawing, and actually, she looked very much like a great first lady, Melania, he added, referring to his wife Melania Trump. He also expressed anger that Harris had been swapped in for Biden on the Democratic ticket. She hasnt done an interview since this whole scam started, Trump said, claiming falsely that Biden dropping off the ticket was a coup. Trump had been leading Biden in many polls of battleground states likely to be critical to the outcome of the Nov. 5 election, but is now trailing Harris in some of the same states. A longstanding critic of electric vehicles, Trump has shifted gears since Musks endorsement. On Monday, he described the electric cars made by Tesla as incredible. He also praised Russian President Vladimir Putin, Chinese President Xi Jinping and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un - all authoritarian strongmen - as at the top of their game. TRUMP BACK ON X Trump returned to X, formerly known as Twitter, with a series of posts on Monday for the first time in a year, reviving an account that had served as a main method of communication in previous campaigns and his four years in the White House, including his followers Jan. 6 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol. Trumps access to his account, realDonaldTrump, was restored a month into Musks ownership of X after being suspended by the platforms previous owners following the Jan. 6 attack, citing concerns he would incite violence. Trump frequently posts on his Truth Social platform, which was launched in February 2022, but his posts there reach a much smaller audience than on X. Musk, who has echoed Trumps false claims about voter fraud and Bidens immigration policies, started an external super PAC spending group to support Trumps campaign. The political action committee is now under investigation in Michigan for possible violations of state laws on gathering voter information. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "date": "August 13, 2024 11:54 am",
        "content": "A study released Monday using data from NASAs Mars InSight lander shows evidence of liquid water far below the surface of the fourth planet, advancing the search for life there and showing what might have happened to Mars ancient oceans. The lander, which has been on the Red Planet since 2018, measured seismic data over four years, examining how quakes shook the ground and determining what materials or substances were beneath the surface. Based on that data, the researchers found liquid water was most likely present deep beneath the lander. Water is considered essential for life, and geological studies show the planets surface had lakes, rivers and oceans more than 3 billion years ago. On Earth what we know is where it is wet enough and there are enough sources of energy, there is microbial life very deep in Earths subsurface, said one of the authors, Vashan Wright of the University of California San Diegos Scripps Institution of Oceanography. The ingredients for life as we know it exist in the Martian subsurface if these interpretations are correct. The study found that large reservoirs of liquid water in fractures 11.5 kilometres (7.15 miles) to 20km beneath the surface best explained the InSight measurements. It notes that the volume of liquid water predicted beneath the surface is more than the water volumes proposed to have filled hypothesized ancient Martian oceans. On Earth, groundwater infiltrated from the surface to deep underground, Wright said. We expect this process to have occurred on Mars as well when the upper crust was warmer than it is today. There is no way to directly study water that deep beneath the surface of Mars, but the authors said the results have implications for understanding Mars water cycle, determining the fates of past surface water, searching for past or extant life, and assessing in situ resource utilization for future missions. The study, whose other authors are Matthias Morzfeld of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography and Michael Manga of the University of California Berkeley, was published the week of Aug. 12 in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

        "date": "August 13, 2024 01:07 pm",
        "content": "The Telecommunications Regulatory Commission of Sri Lanka (TRCSL) has officially issued a Telecommunications Service Provider License to Elon Musks Starlink, the satellite unit of SpaceX, to provide satellite broadband services in Sri Lanka. This license authorizes the company to provide satellite broadband services in Sri Lanka from August 12, 2024. The development follows a recent meeting between President Ranil Wickremesinghe and Elon Musk in Indonesia where they discussed expediting the application process to connect Sri Lanka to the Starlink network, aiming to enhance Sri Lankas access to high-speed internet. The TRCSL has issued a Telecommunications Service Provider License under Section 17B of the Sri Lanka Telecommunications Act No. 25 of 1991 as amended, to Starlink Lanka (Private) Limited for the provision of Satellite Broadband Services in Sri Lanka, a statement said. Sri Lankas parliament passed a new telecommunications bill last month, which amended the law for the first time in 28 years, and paved the way for Starlink to enter the country. On July 09, the Sri Lanka Telecommunications (Amendment) Bill was passed in Parliament with amendments. Under the new telecommunications bill, Sri Lanka introduced a new license category that will allow Starlink service to enter the countrys telecommunications space as a licensed service provider, as previously stated by State Minister of Technology Kanaka Herath. The initiative of integrating the global Starlink network with Sri Lanka is said to be aimed at addressing the internet connectivity issues, particularly in areas outside Colombo. Sri Lanka granted Starlink preliminary approval in June after fast-tracking the process. Starlink will have to pay a tariff for the license, which will be issued by the countrys telecommunications regulator, according to the State Minister. President Ranil Wickremesinghe had met with billionaire investor Elon Musk on the sidelines of the 10th World Water Forum High-Level Meeting being held in Indonesia on May 19, during which they had discussed the implementation of Starlink in Sri Lanka. Musk was in Indonesias resort island of Bali to launch Starlink satellite internet service in the worlds largest archipelago nation. The billionaire head of Tesla and SpaceX and owner of social platform X had launched the service alongside Indonesian President Joko Widodo in a ceremony at a public health clinic in Denpasar, the provincial capital of Bali. Unlike traditional telecommunications providers, which prioritise the most populated urban areas, Starlink aims to provide global coverage, extending internet connectivity to even the most remote corners of the planet. Starlink can provide internet access to virtually any location on Earth with a constellation of LEO satellites that can be re-positioned at any point, and according to experts, reliable internet access is possible, whether the user operates in the Congo, the Arctic, or on an oil rig located hundreds of miles offshore. So far, Starlink has more than 02 million active customers and is available on all seven continents and in over 60 countries.",

        "title": "More Indian hospitals hit by doctors protest against alleged rape and murder",
        "date": "August 13, 2024 04:00 pm",
        "content": "Hospital services were disrupted in several Indian cities on Tuesday, after the nationwide spread of a doctors protest against the alleged rape and murder of a 31-year-old doctor in the eastern city of Kolkata, authorities and media said. Television images showed thousands of doctors marching on Monday to protest the incident at a government-run hospital, calling for justice for the victim and better security measures, paralysing health services in West Bengal state. The protest rippled nationwide on Tuesday, joined by more than 8,000 government doctors in the western Maharashtra state, home to the financial capital of Mumbai, halting work in all hospital departments except emergency services, media said. In the capital, New Delhi, junior doctors wearing white coats held posters that read, Doctors are not punching bags, as they sat in protest outside a large government hospital to demand an investigation, Reuters Television images showed. Thousands of patients were left stranded by similar protests in cities such as Lucknow, capital of the most populous state of Uttar Pradesh, and in the western tourist resort state of Goa that crimped some hospital services, media said. Pedestrian working conditions, inhuman workloads and violence in the workplace are the reality, the Indian Medical Association, the biggest grouping of doctors in the country, told Health Minister J P Nadda in a letter. A health ministry spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Doctors maintain their workplace environment is unsafe, even after the weekend arrest of a police volunteer in Kolkata for the doctors murder, and the resignation of the principal of the medical college where it happened. City police chief Vineet Kumar Goyal told reporters a case had been registered against the suspect under provisions of the law relating to rape and murder. West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee told reporters she had given state police a deadline of Sunday to complete their investigation, or she would hand it to federal agencies. Emergency services stayed suspended on Tuesday in almost all the government-run medical college hospitals in Kolkata, state official N S Nigam told Reuters, adding that the government was assessing the impact on health services. Doctors in Indias crowded and often squalid government hospitals, who find themselves overworked and underpaid, sometimes also end up bearing the brunt of violence by those angered at medical services they see as falling short.

        "content": "Pokémon voice actress Rachael Lillis, who starred in Pokémon TV series, films and video games dating back as far as the late 1990s, has died from breast cancer at the age of 46. Lillis voiced the main characters of Misty and Jessie and many more on the beloved Japanese animated series. Her death was announced by Veronica Taylor, who co-stars as Pokémon lead character Ash Ketchum. Ms Taylor wrote: Rachael was an extraordinary talent, a bright light that shone through her voice whether speaking or singing. We all know Rachael Lillis from the many wonderful roles she played, Ms Taylor wrote on social media on Monday. She filled our Saturday mornings and beforeafter school hours with her beautiful voice, her terrific comic timing, and her remarkable acting skills. She said Lillis was grateful for the support she received as she battled cancer. It truly made a positive difference, Ms Taylor said. Her sister also confirmed Lilliss death on a GoFundMe set up earlier this year to raise money for her cancer treatment and to move her into a nursing home. This was unexpected and we are completely grief-stricken, wrote Laurie Orr, adding that her sisters health began to decline last week. My heart breaks losing my dear little sister, though I am comforted knowing she is free, she said. The page has raised more than 100,000 (78,000) - including donations made by fans since her death was announced, who said she had gone too soon and much too young and her light shined bright through her work. Ms Orr said the funds would now go towards paying off remaining medical bills, a memorial service and efforts to combat cancer. Lillis was born in Niagara Falls, New York, in 1978 and trained in opera at university before becoming a voice actor. Her voice appeared on 423 episodes of Pokémon between 1997 and 2015, according to IMDB. She also voiced Pokémon character Jigglypuff, including in the 2019 film Detective Pikachu and in the Super Smash Bros video game series. Source: BBC --Agencies",

        "date": "August 14, 2024 09:45 am",
        "content": "Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said he will step down in September, ending a three-year term marred by political scandals and paving the way for a new premier to address the impact of rising prices. I will continue to do everything I can as prime minister until then end of my term in September, Kishida said in a televised press conference on Wednesday to announce his decision not seek re-election as Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) leader. His decision to quit triggers a contest to replace him as party boss, and by extension as the leader of the worlds fourth-biggest economy. Kishidas public support eroded amid revelations about the partys ties to the controversial Unification Church, and more recently, unrecorded political donations made at LDP fundraising parties. Hes been a dead man walking for quite some time, said Michael Cucek, a professor specialising in Japanese politics at Temple University in Tokyo.There was no way to add up the numbers so that he would get reelected, he added. The successor the LDP chooses will have to unite a fractious ruling group and tackle likely further increases in living costs, escalating geopolitical tensions with China, and the potential return of Donald Trump as U.S. president next year. As the countrys eighth-longest serving post-war leader, Kishida led Japan out of the COVID pandemic with massive stimulus spending, but later appointed Kazuo Ueda, an academic tasked with ending his predecessors radical monetary stimulus, to head the Bank of Japan (BOJ). The BOJ in July unexpectedly raised interest rates as inflation took hold, contributing to stock market instability and sending the yen sharply lower. Kishidas departure could mean tighter fiscal and monetary conditions depending on the candidate, according to Shoki Omori, chief Japan desk strategist, Mizuho Securities, Tokyo. In short, risk-assets, particularly equities, will likely be hit the most, he added. In another break from the past, Kishida also eschewed corporate profit-driven trickle-down economics in favour of policies aimed at boosting household incomes, including wage hikes and promoting share ownership.

        "date": "August 14, 2024 10:11 am",
        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe emphasized that, following the establishment of law and order in July 2022, the citizens will have the opportunity to vote for a new President on September 21, 2024. The President also highlighted that it is the responsibility of himself as the President, the Election Commission and the Police Department to support free and independent elections by maintaining law and order in the country. President Ranil Wickremesinghe made this statement during the opening of the Special Operations Command of the Police Special Task Force in Sri Jayawardanepura, last afternoon (13). The President emphasized that following the Presidential Election on September 21, violence must be avoided, and urged everyone to act responsibly. President Ranil Wickremesinghe, upon arriving at the Special Operations Command in Sri Jayawardanepura, was warmly received with the Police Special Task Force Excellence Awards. The President, who unveiled the plaque and officially opened the Special Operations Command, also participated in inspecting the troops accommodations. The current commander of the Police Special Task Force Varuna Jayasundara, presented a commemorative gift to President Ranil Wickremesinghe. This command centre will act as the primary hub for managing public order and motorcycle patrols. The Director of Special Operations will oversee the operational command of the specialized units within the Special Task Force, reporting directly to the Special Task Force Commander through the Deputy Operations Commander. The specialized teams at this centre will handle emergencies such as terrorist attacks, violent extremism, public protests, hostage situations, and other similar crises. President Ranil Wickremesinghe further stated that to enhance drug control, all existing police, military, and civil agencies will be consolidated into a single agency under the Anti-Drug Act, with relevant powers transferred to this new body. The President emphasized that the underworld and drug traffickers must not be allowed to undermine the country. He also announced that new laws will be introduced to combat underworld activities using advanced technology. Additionally, the President highlighted that ensuring law and order is essential for protecting the basic rights of the people and expressed his intention to include this commitment in the law. President Ranil Wickremesinghe further stated, The opening of this Special Operations Centre today marks a significant milestone for the Special Task Force. Originally deployed to Batticaloa to combat LTTE terrorism, this team has evolved into a key force for maintaining law and order in Sri Lanka and has gained international recognition. The world today is different from the past and will continue to change in the future. By 2030, our countrys security must be updated and modernized to keep pace. Increasingly, technology plays a crucial role in every sector, and we need to leverage it more in our security measures. Today, the line between ordinary crimes and special crimes has blurred. What were once isolated criminal acts have evolved into organized conflicts. Drug trafficking, for instance, has become a battleground among competing groups. As a result, we need to re-evaluate and update our strategies for combating these illegal activities. Today, individuals involved in the underworld can exploit new technology, necessitating the introduction of specific laws to control them. I propose establishing a new agency under the Anti-Narcotics Act, which would consolidate all police, military, and civil agencies into a single entity with designated powers. This agency could be tasked with long-term engagement in combating drug-related activities. It is crucial that drug dealers are prevented from undermining society. Ensuring that citizens live under law and order is fundamental to protecting their basic rights, and we aim to protect this principle in the law. Additionally, a significant task lies ahead next month with the Presidential Election scheduled for September 21. It is the responsibility of the Police Department to maintain law and order and to facilitate the election process in a lawful manner. This duty extends not only to me as President but also to the Election Commission and the Police Department. Furthermore, violence often occurs after elections, and we must prevent it. There must be no violence following this election, and we need to focus on this issue carefully. We are able to hold this election today because law and order have been maintained in the country and our constitution has been upheld. A new government will be appointed in accordance with the constitution. Since 1931, Sri Lanka has consistently upheld universal suffrage and democracy, making it unique in this regard. While there have been other allegations of human rights violations, Sri Lanka is the only country that has maintained this democratic system. It is crucial to protect and preserve this system; it must never be compromised. Despite political disagreements, the system allows for the peaceful transition of power, with parties accepting election results and changing governments accordingly. However, two years ago, the government of this country collapsed. Protesters attempted to seize the Presidential Secretariat, the Presidential Palace, and Temple Trees, set fire to the Prime Ministers private residence, occupied the Prime Ministers Office, and took control of Parliament. However, due to the efforts of our armed forces and other law enforcement agencies, we were able to prevent the loss of Parliament that day. After taking over the government, I implemented the necessary steps to stabilize the economy and avert bankruptcy. As a result, we are able to hold an election today, which is something we can be proud of. But we must consider what could have happened if we hadnt taken those steps to uphold law and order. The election today is possible because of the decisive actions we took then. In contrast, the government of Bangladesh has been ousted, and no one is willing to take over. Members of Parliament are being killed, and key figures like the Defence Secretary, Chief Justice, and Central Bank Governor has been forced to flee. Hotels have been set on fire and destroyed, and the situation in that country remains far from normal. But we were spared from such a situation because of the actions taken by you, the security forces of our country. Now, on September 21, the people of this country have the opportunity to vote for the candidate of their choice. We have consistently maintained law and order in the country. I extend my best wishes to my friend Muhammad Yuns and hope that law and order will soon be restored in Bangladesh. It must never be neglected. Democracy and the existence of a legitimate government are fundamental rights in this country. If a government is duly elected, it must be protected. I learned this in 1970 when the United National Party was in opposition. During the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna rebellion, J.R. Jayawardene, who was the Leader of the Opposition, said, We may not like this government, and it should be replaced, but it must be done within a democratic framework. This rebellion is a threat to democracy, so I fully support Bandaranaikes government. It may not be the government I prefer, but it is the government chosen by the people. Since then, we have upheld this principle. In 1989, the Leader of the Opposition, Sirimavo Bandaranaike, along with Anuruddha Ratwatte, met with President Premadasa and declared, We give you our full support. That is part of our history. Because you restored law and order in July 2022, the people of this country now have the opportunity to vote for a President on September 21, 2024. I thank you all for making this possible. --PMD",

        "content": "A Fundamental Rights petition has been filed at the Supreme Court, requesting to issue an order to the President to appoint an Acting Inspector General of Police (IGP). Attorney-at-Law R.S.P. Ranasuriya has submitted the FR petition to the Supreme Court. President Ranil Wickremesinghe and the Attorney General have been named as respondents in the petition. On July 24, the Supreme Court issued an interim order preventing Deshabandu Tennakoon from performing duties and functioning in the position of the IGP. The Supreme Court had issued this order after granting leave to proceed with the nine petitions, filed by several parties including Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith, challenging Tennakoons appointment as the IGP. The Supreme Court had also ordered the President to name a suitable person for the position of IGP, for the duration of the interim order being enforced against Deshabandu Tennakoon. It was later reported that given the upcoming Presidential Election, President Wickremesinghe has been advised by his legal team that appointing an Acting IGP every two weeks could lead to election petitions against him. Consequently, the President had reportedly informed the Speaker of Parliament that he will refrain from getting involved in this matter. Delivering a special statement in Parliament the following day on the government stance on the matter, Prime Minister Dinesh Gunawardena clarified that the President has no legal provisions at this moment to appoint an Acting IGP. The Prime Minister also emphasized that the position of the IGP is not vacated presently. He also stated that the court cannot change the approval granted by the Constitutional Council to appoint the current IGP. We remind the Speaker and Parliament that the order of the Supreme Court suspending the duties of the IGP should be nullified. We request the Speaker to intervene as soon as possible in this regard, he said. Following the PMs statement, the Speaker of the Parliament Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena had informed the House that the decision to appoint the Inspector General of Police (IGP) was correct, legal, constitutional, and made in good faith. He further said that the situation with regard to the IGP cannot be resolved even by the President, and the matter must be sorted out in court if necessary.",

        "date": "August 14, 2024 02:46 pm",
        "content": "BANGKOK (AP)  A court in Thailand on Wednesday removed Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin from office over an ethical violation, further shaking up Thai politics after the court-ordered dissolution of the main opposition party a week ago. The case for which the Constitutional Court judged Srettha involved his appointment of a Cabinet member who had been imprisoned over an alleged attempt to bribe a court official. The court voted 5:4 against Srettha and the ruling removed him from office immediately. The Cabinet will remain in place on a caretaker basis until Parliament approves a new prime minister. There is no time limit for Parliament to fill the position. Srettha had appointed Pichit Chuenban as a minister of the Prime Ministers Office in a Cabinet reshuffle in April. Pichit was jailed for six months in 2008 on contempt of court charges after he allegedly tried to bribe a judge with 2 million baht (55,000) in cash in a grocery bag over a case involving former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra. Pichit resigned from the post weeks after being appointed when controversy over the incident was revived. The court said that although Pichit has already served his jail term, his behavior  as ruled by the Supreme Court  was dishonest. Srettha as prime minister has sole responsibility for vetting the qualifications of his Cabinet nominations, the court ruled. It said he knew about Pichits past but still nominated him, and therefore they ruled that he violated the ethics codes. The petition against Srettha was initiated by former members of the military-installed Senate who had refused to approve Move Forwards prime ministerial candidate when the party was attempting to form a government after its election victory. The petition against Srettha was seen as a move favoring a pro-military political party in his coalition government. Thailands courts, especially the Constitutional Court, are considered a bulwark of the countrys royalist establishment, which has used them and nominally independent state agencies such as the Election Commission to issue rulings to cripple or sink political opponents. Srettha became prime minister in August last year, despite his Pheu Thai party finishing second in the general election. After Move Forward was denied power by the Senate whose term ended in May, Pheu Thai  then the biggest partner of Move Forward  excluded it from the coalition and joined hands with parties affiliated with the previous military-controlled government to gather enough support from other parties and the Senate to approve a new prime minister. The Constitutional Court last week ordered the dissolution of the progressive Move Forward Party  which won the most seats in the 2023 election but failed to take power  over an accusation that the party violated the constitution by proposing an amendment to a law against defaming the countrys royal family. The party has already regrouped as the Peoples Party. Source: AP --Agencies",

        "date": "August 14, 2024 04:34 pm",
        "content": "Officials in Spain are investigating singer Katy Perry, for allegedly filming a music video in ecologically-sensitive sand dunes in the Balearic Islands without permission. The video for her latest single Lifetimes shows the singer enjoying beaches and partying in clubs on the islands of Ibiza and Formentera. But scenes believed to have been filmed in the middle of the protected dunes on the isle of SEspalmador in Formentera have raised concern. A statement from the Spanish government alleged that the production company responsible for the video had not sought permission. Katy Perry has not commented. Officials stressed that Katy Perry was not under investigation for what it called crimes against the environment, as filming can be authorised in the area. The environment department of the Balearic Islands issued a press release on Tuesday, claiming that the videos production company did not secure the necessary authorisation before filming. As a result, their release said, preliminary investigation actions have been initiated. The department drew attention to one section of the Natural Resources Management Plan, which states that photographic, cinematographic or videographic reports for an advertising or commercial exhibition purpose requires express authorisation of the ministry for the environment. The video for Lifetimes includes shots of the dune system of SEspalmador, one of the most ecologically rich areas of Formentera. SEspalmador is an uninhabited islet located to the north of Formentera, and is approximately 1.8 miles long. It has been part of the Ses Salines de Ibiza and Formentera natural park since 1980. The dunes on the small, privately owned island are of great ecological value, according to the regional governments tourism website. BBC News has contacted production company WeOwnTheCity, and representatives for Katy Perry, for comment. It follows a shaky album campaign for the singer, who is releasing her seventh album 143 in September. The first single from the upcoming project, Womans World, was critically panned and failed to make an impact on the charts, with many feeling its feminist messaging was out of touch. The Guardian asked what regressive, warmed-over hell is this?, The Cut stated that Perry is stuck in 2016, and Rolling Stone raised the question: Did Katy Perry release the worst comeback single of all time? Follow-up single Lifetimes has also been produced by Dr Luke who Perry has been criticised for working with. Singer Kesha sued Dr Luke in 2014, seeking to void their contract because, her lawyers claimed, he had sexually, physically, verbally, and emotionally abused Kesha to the point where she nearly lost her life. Dr Luke denied the claims. They reached an agreement to settle a years-long defamation lawsuit last year. Source: BBC --Agencies",

        "date": "August 14, 2024 04:59 pm",
        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe has revealed plans to provide relief for personal income tax in the near future as the government is considering adjustments to the personal income tax structure to provide relief to taxpayers, the Presidents Media Division reported. Following the strong performance in tax revenue this year, the government has proposed to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) an adjustment in Personal Income Tax slabs from Rs. 500,000 to Rs. 720,000, aiming to provide relief to mid-level taxpayers affected by recent tax reforms, he said. The IMF, in turn, has suggested changes, offering more relief to lower bands, similar relief for mid-level taxpayers and slightly less for higher earners, while keeping the proposals core intact, he said. The President revealed this while delivering the keynote address at the University Lecturers Conference held at the Waters Edge Hotel last evening (13). The President mentioned that two proposals, currently under review by the Treasury and the counter proposal by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) are being considered to achieve the goal of providing some benefit to the middle segments like the academia. We are now in the next stage of discussing tax thresholds. We have had strong economic performance this year and hope to maintain it next year. We are considering adjustments to the personal income tax structure to provide relief to taxpayers, the President was quoted as saying. He added that currently, there are two proposals being considered. The Treasurys proposal maintains a tax-free threshold of Rs. 1.2 million, widens the tax band from Rs. 500,000 to 720,000, and keeps the top tax rate at 36. And the counter proposal by the IMF proposes that the tax-free threshold remains at Rs. 1.2 million, but the first tax band is widened from Rs. 500,000 to 1 million rupees, shifting all tax bands up by 500,000 rupees, with subsequent bands remaining at Rs. 500,000 rupees and the top tax rate remains at 36. He stated that they are evaluating these proposals and working towards one that provides relief. I am considering the IMF proposal. Our decision will be guided by what is best for the country and the people, he said. In his speech, delivered under the theme Transforming Sri Lankas Higher Education towards a Developed Nation, President Wickremesinghe also announced a comprehensive reform plan aimed at transforming Sri Lankas higher education system as a key strategy to stimulate economic recovery. President Wickremesinghe emphasized the critical role of higher education in driving the country towards development and highlighted the need for state universities to operate with greater independence to enhance the quality of education. President Ranil Wickremesinghes full speech: Before attending this event, I took part in an important discussion about the countrys economic situation. However, there may be some good news for you all as we proceed, which might help retain some of the lecturers in Sri Lanka. The past two years have been very difficult, as the minister mentioned. It was thanks to the skill of our ministers that we survived the first year, virtually from nothing. We started from scratch and then built the economy up. Now we have signed agreements with the OCC, IMF, and others. There are many proposals in these agreements, but I believe the benchmarks are key. You should be aware of them because we have to operate within these benchmarks. The macroeconomic benchmarks, agreed upon between Sri Lanka, 17 OCC countries, credit countries, China (represented by the Exim Bank), the IMF, the ADB, and the World Bank totalling 21 entities took over a year of negotiations. These benchmarks cannot be changed; how we achieve them is a different matter. First, we must have a primary budget surplus of 2.3 by 2025-2032. Currently, we are at 0.6 of GDP, so our budget needs to be adjusted to achieve a surplus of 2.3. The public debt to GDP ratio must be reduced to 95 by 2032, down from 111 today. The gross financing needs to GDP ratio must be 13 by 2032, while it is currently 27.8, so we need to halve it. The forex debt service to GDP must be 1.3 compared to the current 9.2. The tax revenue to GDP ratio must reach 14 by 2025, while we are currently at 9.5. Our international reserves must be 15 billion USD by 2028; we are currently at 5.6 billion USD. Inflation must not exceed 5, and treasury guarantees should be less than 75. We have achieved these two targets for now. We cannot have arrears in government payments beyond three months. Monetary financing by the central bank is not permitted. Cost-effective pricing of electricity and fuel must be maintained, and any losses in the CEB or CPC must be directly compensated through treasury transfers. Minimum expenditure thresholds on social safety net cash transfers must be maintained. We agreed to increase the number of beneficiaries from 1.6 million to 2.4 million. During the bankruptcy period, we provided more social benefits than before, and we need to continue this trend. These terms are non-negotiable. Our creditors have agreed to provide debt relief up to about 10 billion USD. The IMF agreement gave us USD 2.9 billion over three years. Together with the USD 10.5 billion benefit, this aids us significantly, but we must meet the targets. This is why we have introduced the Economic Transformation Bill. We should aim to make Sri Lanka an export-oriented and competitive economy. We are now in the next stage of discussing tax thresholds. We have had strong economic performance this year and hope to maintain it next year. We are considering adjustments to the personal income tax structure to provide relief to taxpayers. Currently, there are two proposals. The Treasurys proposal maintains a tax-free threshold of Rs. 1.2 million, widens the tax band from Rs. 500,000 to 720,000, and keeps the top tax rate at 36. And the counter proposal by the IMF proposes that the tax-free threshold remains at Rs. 1.2 million, but the first tax band is widened from Rs. 500,000 to 1 million rupees, shifting all tax bands up by 500,000 rupees, with subsequent bands remaining at Rs. 500,000 rupees and the top tax rate remains at 36. We are evaluating these proposals and working towards one that provides relief. I am considering the IMF proposal. Our decision will be guided by what is best for the country and the people. The economy is growing, but we need to accelerate growth. We must focus on maximizing the benefits of our human resources. To do this, we need a top-class education system. We are discussing improvements to the school system and post-school education. We plan to consolidate about 500 vocational training centres and nine provincial agencies into vocational education colleges. We are also considering university colleges of technology and management offering associate degrees. Many students have asked why they were educated if they cannot find jobs. To address this, we propose associate degrees that are job-oriented, with the option to pursue bachelors or higher diplomas later. We aim to elevate our universities to a higher standard. This will take time, but we need to start by restructuring state universities and providing more autonomy. Universities should have the freedom to manage their finances and attract foreign students. We could consider a model where the government funds local students while universities charge foreign students. We are also planning new universities and expanding existing ones. We have proposals for four new technology-focused universities and potential collaboration with international institutions. As we expand, we may face a shortage of academics. We also have non-government degree-awarding institutes that could be granted university status. We should consider new models for universities, including options for funding and management. The goal is to make Sri Lanka a key academic centre, capitalizing on the anticipated increase in demand for higher education in the region. We have many plans and ideas for advancing education and economic growth. We need to continue building on what we have started and aim for success. I appreciate your time and am open to any questions you may have. Source: PMD",

The Acting General Secretary of the Parliament Chaminda Kularatne had informed the Chairman of the Election Commission in writing on August 12 that two Parliamentary seats in the Ninth Parliament have become vacant from the 09 August 2024 due to the cancellation of the parliamentary seats of Manusha Nanayakkara and Harin Fernando. On 09 August 2024, the Supreme Court determined that the Samagi Jana Balawegayas (SJB) decision to expel Galle District Member of Parliament Manusha Nanayakkara and the National List Member of Parliament Harin Fernando from the party is legally valid. As a result, the two Parliamentary seats became vacant. The Supreme Court declared this ruling while dismissing the petitions filed by Harin Fernando and Manusha Nanayakkkara challenging the SJBs decision to remove them from their party membership. On July 18, 2023, the Working Committee of the SJB decided to expel party members Harin Fernando and Manusha Nanayakkara from the party. In May 2022, the SJB had suspended the party membership of the two parliamentarians after they had accepted ministerial portfolios in the government while the party had vowed to take disciplinary action against them. However, the General Secretary of Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) Ranjith Madduma Bandara stated that party member Bandulal Bandarigoda will be appointed fill the parliamentary seat which fell vacant following the suspension of the party membership of Manusha Nanayakkara through a Supreme Court ruling. Bandarigoda, who secured 34,897 votes and the third place from the Galle District in 2020 General Election, is next in line on SJBs preferential vote list. Meanwhile, he also said a qualified individual will be named by the SJB to fill the MP seat which remains vacant as Harin Fernando was also disqualified to hold the MP seat due to the suspension of his party membership, since Fernando was elected to the Parliament through SJBs national list.",

        "title": "Ukraine is advancing deeper into Russia, Zelenskiy says",
        "date": "August 14, 2024 10:09 pm",
        "content": "Ukraine said on Wednesday its forces had advanced further into Russias Kursk region in the biggest foreign incursion into Russia since World War Two, posing a dilemma for President Vladimir Putin according to U.S. President Joe Biden. Thousands of Ukrainian troops rammed through the Russian border in the early hours of Aug. 6 into Russias western Kursk region in what Putin called a major provocation aimed at gaining a stronger hand in possible future ceasefire talks. Ukraine has carved out a slice of the Russian border region of Kursk and though Putin said the Russian army would push out the Ukrainian troops, more than a week of intense battles have so far failed to oust them. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said Kyivs forces were continuing to gain ground in the Kursk region and that they had taken another one to two kilometres on Wednesday. We continue to advance further in the Kursk region, Zelenskiy wrote in a statement on Telegram, from one to two kilometres in various areas since the start of the day. And more than 100 Russian prisoners of war in the same period. Russias defence ministry said 117 Ukrainian drones had been shot down within its territory overnight, mostly in the Kursk, Voronezh, Belgorod and Nizhny Novgorod regions. It said missiles had also been downed, and showed Sukhoi Su-34 bombers striking Ukrainian positions in the Kursk region. Later, the ministry said Russian forces had repelled a series of Ukrainian attacks inside the Kursk region, including at Russkoye Porechnoye 18 km (11 miles) from the border, and pro-Russian war bloggers said the front has been stabilised. The Ukrainian drone attack included strikes on four Russian military airfields in an attempt to undermine Russias ability to attack Ukraine with gliding bombs, a Ukrainian security source told Reuters on condition of anonymity. Russias National Guard said it was beefing up security at the Kursk nuclear power plant, located just 35 km (22 miles) from the fighting. The Ukrainian assault into Russian territory has dramatically changed the narrative around the two-and-a-half-year-old war. Russia had been advancing in eastern Ukraine since the failure of Kyivs 2023 counteroffensive to make any major gains against Russian forces. But Ukraines unprecedented incursion also comes with major risks for Russia, Ukraine and the West, which is keen to avoid a direct confrontation between Russia and the U.S.-led NATO military alliance that has helped arm Kyiv against Moscow. Biden said U.S. officials were in constant touch with Ukraine over the incursion, which he said had created a real dilemma for Putin, who ordered thousands of troops into Ukraine in February 2022. The White House said Ukraine gave no advance notice of its incursion and the United States had no involvement. Russian officials have suggested Ukraines Western backers must have known of the attack. Of course they are involved, Russian lawmaker Maria Butina told Reuters. It looks even worse when they say they dont know anything and put all the responsibility on Ukraine. RUSSIA ON DEFENSIVE Russian state television said Russian forces were turning the tide on the Ukrainian forces, showed footage of successful attacks on Ukrainian positions and gave wide coverage of the evacuations of Russian civilians from the border zone. Ukraines top commander, Oleksandr Syrskyi, said that the Russian town of Sudzha, a transhipment hub for Russian natural gas flowing to Europe via Ukraine, was fully under Ukrainian control. Natural gas was still pumping on Wednesday. By bringing the war to Russia, Ukraine has forced nearly 200,000 Russians to evacuate border regions near the site where during World War Two in 1943 the Red Army defeated Nazi forces in one of the worlds biggest ever tank battles. Putin said on Monday that Ukraine with the help of its Western masters was aiming to improve Kyivs negotiating position ahead of possible peace talks. But he questioned what negotiations there could be with an enemy he accused of firing indiscriminately at Russian civilians and nuclear facilities. The Russian rouble weakened against the dollar on Wednesday, and has lost 8.5 since the start of the Ukrainian incursion. Russian officials say Ukraine is trying to show its Western supporters that it can still muster major military operations as pressure mounts on both Kyiv and Moscow to agree to talk about halting the conflict, Europes biggest since World War Two. Zelenskiy has said the incursion is meant to pressure Russian forces and restore justice after Russias invasion. The offensive brings risks for Kyiv: Ukraine may leave other parts of the front on home soil exposed by dedicating forces to fighting in Russian sovereign territory. Russia controls 18 of Ukrainian territory and has been gradually advancing recently. Russian military bloggers said they expected Ukraine to make at least one more major move over coming days. In Russias border region of Belgorod, the governor, Vyacheslav Gladkov, declared a regionwide state of emergency. The situation remains difficult, Yuri Podolyaka, an influential Ukrainian-born, pro-Russian military blogger, said of the situation in Kursk. The enemy still has the initiative, and so, albeit slowly, it is increasing its presence in the Kursk region. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "date": "August 15, 2024 10:47 am",
        "content": "The World Health Organization on Wednesday declared mpox a global public health emergency for the second time in two years, following an outbreak of the viral infection in Democratic Republic of Congo that has spread to neighbouring countries. An emergency committee met earlier on Wednesday to advise WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus on whether the disease outbreak constitutes a public health emergency of international concern, or PHEIC. PHEIC status is WHOs highest level of alert and aims to accelerate research, funding and international public health measures and cooperation to contain a disease. Its clear that a coordinated international response is essential to stop these outbreaks and save lives, said Tedros. Mpox can spread through close contact. Usually mild, it is fatal in rare cases. It causes flu-like symptoms and pus-filled lesions on the body. The outbreak in Congo began with the spread of an endemic strain, known as clade I. But a new variant, clade Ib, appears to spread more easily through routine close contact, including sexual contact. It has spread from Congo to neighbouring countries, including Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda and Uganda, triggering the action from the WHO. The detection and rapid spread of a new clade of mpox in eastern DRC, its detection in neighbouring countries that had not previously reported mpox, and the potential for further spread within Africa and beyond is very worrying, Tedros added. Tedros said on Wednesday that WHO had released 1.5 million in contingency funds and plans to release more in the coming days. WHOs response plan would require an initial 15 million, and the agency plans to appeal to donors for funding. Earlier this week, Africas top public health body declared an mpox emergency for the continent after warning that the viral infection was spreading at an alarming rate, with more than 17,000 suspected cases and more than 500 deaths this year, mainly among children in Congo. Professor Dimie Ogoina, chair of WHOs mpox emergency committee, said all members unanimously agreed that the current upsurge of cases is an extraordinary event, with a record number of cases in Congo. Vaccines and behaviour change helped stop the spread when a different strain of mpox spread globally, primarily among men who have sex with men, and WHO declared an emergency in 2022. In Congo, the transmission routes need further study, WHO said. No vaccines are yet available, although efforts are underway to change that and work out who best to target. The agency also appealed to countries with stockpiles to donate shots. Source: Reuters --Agencies",
