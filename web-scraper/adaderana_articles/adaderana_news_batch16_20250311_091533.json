        "date": "June 9, 2024 10:41 am",
        "content": "Sri Lanka Railways (SLR) stated that a total of 35 scheduled train journeys were cancelled this morning due to the continued strike by the Locomotive Operating Engineers Union of the railway department. The Locomotive Operating Engineers Union says that the strike launched by the locomotive drivers will continue for the third consecutive day today (09). They have been on strike since midnight on Thursday, (June 06) over several key demands including solutions to the delays in second-class promotions of locomotive drivers, delays in the recruitment process and several other issues. It is also mentioned that only locomotive drivers of two of the five running sheds have joined the strike and due to this there will be no power set trains operating. Meanwhile, the Secretary of the union S.R.C.M. Senanayake stated that if the authorities fail to address their demands, they would be taking steps to intensify their trade union action. However, in response to an inquiry made by Ada Derana, a spokesperson for the Ministry of Transport and Highways revealed that they plan to file a complaint with the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) regarding the ongoing strike action. It is stated that the complaint would be filed considering the information received about 21 individuals who are carrying out the strike to inconvenience the government.",

        "title": "Israel rescues four hostages in operation Gazan officials say killed more than 200",
        "date": "June 9, 2024 12:41 pm",
        "content": "The Israeli military rescued four hostages in a special operation in the Nuseirat refugee camp, central Gaza, that Gazan authorities said killed 236 people and injured more than 400 others. Noa Argamani, Almog Meir Jan, Andrey Kozlov, and Shlomi Ziv, were rescued by the Israeli military, intelligence and special forces from two separate locations in Nuseirat, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said Saturday. All four were kidnapped from the Nova music festival on October 7. They are in good medical condition and have been transferred to the Sheba Tel-HaShomer Medical Center for further medical examinations, the IDF added. An Israeli policeman from a special counter-terrorism unit was killed in Saturdays rescue operation, according to Israeli police. News of the rescue came soon after Israels military said it was operating in Nuseirat and other areas of central Gaza, where heavy shelling and artillery fire was reported. At least 236 people have been killed as a result of the rescue operation and more than 400 injured, hospital officials in Gaza said Saturday. The killed and wounded were taken to two hospitals in Gaza, Al-Awda Hospital in Nuseirat and Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in Deir Al-Balah. Al-Awda Hospital director Dr Marwan Abu Nasser told CNN that 142 bodies had been counted at the medical facility by late Saturday, while Al-Aqsa Hospital in Deir al-Balah said 94 bodies had been counted. CNN has no way of verifying casualty numbers reported by Palestinian officials in Gaza. Medical records in the war-torn enclave do not differentiate between civilians and militants killed. An Israeli military spokesperson put the number of casualties from the operation at under 100, and had no information on how many of those were civilians. Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said Israeli forces had to enter civilian areas to reach hostages as this was where Hamas had embedded itself. He said the hostages had been locked in two separate apartments in civilian multi-story buildings about 200 meters (650 feet) apart, with Argamani held in a different building to the three males. He said the IDF had received intelligence on their location beforehand, noting that hostages in Gaza were frequently moved around and Argamani had previously been held elsewhere. Similar raids had been called off at the last minute more than three or four times due to unfavorable conditions, he added. The first phase of Saturdays operation saw the IDF target militant infrastructure with pre-planned strikes, Hagari said. For the rescue, the IDF had opted for a daytime operation because of the element of surprise, he added, and it had prepared by building models of the apartments the hostages were held in. Hagari said that the IDF had come under intense fire, especially after withdrawing from the apartments, but did not provide evidence for his claims. Saturday was an emotional and happy day for the state of Israel and the IDF, Hagari said, though he cautioned that most of the remaining hostages were not being held in conditions that would allow for similar operations. Following Saturdays announcement, the total number of hostages still held in the Gaza Strip from October 7 is now 116, of which at least 41 are dead. It is hell on earth On the ground in Gaza, locals described scenes of carnage following the strikes that led up to the rescue. Nidal Abdo, was shopping in Nuseirat on Saturday when he described a crazy bombardment hitting. It was something we never witnessed before, maybe 150 rockets fell in less than 10 minutes, while we were running away more fell on the market, he said. There are children torn apart and scattered in the streets, they wiped out Nuseirat, it is hell on earth, he said. Another local, Abu Abdallah, said the strike hit while people were sleeping, adding: Dogs were eating peoples remains. We pulled out six martyrs, all torn up children and women, we risked our lives to get them to the hospital. Footage from Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital shows trucks and ambulances transferring injured people and bodies to the hospital. Inside the hospital, people can be seen waiting on the floor. Graphic video shows many Palestinians, including children, injured with blood on their faces and clothes. Footage from the hospital also shows people screaming and crying, huddled over bodies covered in blankets. Hamas described the operation as a brutal crime, devoid of the values of civilization and humanity, saying the Israeli military committed a horrific massacre against innocent civilians. Hamas said the rescue would not change Israels strategic failure in the Gaza Strip, as the group still holds a large number of other hostages after eight months of fighting. The groups leader Ismail Haniyeh said, Our people will not surrender, and the resistance will continue to defend our rights in the face of this criminal enemy. Abu Obaida, the spokesman for the groups armed wing, the Al-Qassam Brigades, also claimed some hostages had been killed during the rescue mission, but provided no proof and did not elaborate on the identities of who had purportedly died. In a post on Telegram, he said the rescue raid posed a great danger to the remaining hostages and will have a devastating impact on their conditions and lives. Asked about the claim, the Israel Defense Forces said, Hamas is a terrorist organization that uses psychological terrorism in order to achieve its goals, accordingly its statements should be taken with limited credibility. Hostage rescues are rare: this is only the third such successful operation. IDF Corporal Ori Megidish was rescued in October last year from the northern Gaza Strip. In another operation on February 12 this year, Fernando Marman and Louis Har were rescued from southern Rafah. A symbol of October 7 One of the rescued group, 25-year-old Noa Argamani, became one of the symbols of the October 7 attacks, after video emerged of her shouting and pleading from the seat of a motorbike as a group of Hamas fighters drives away with her in tow. In the video, Argamanis boyfriend, fellow Israeli citizen Avinatan Or, is also led away by Hamas fighters. Noas mother Liora Argamani is a Chinese citizen who has been grappling with late stage brain cancer. In a video released last November, she made a desperate plea to be able to see her daughter one more time. I dont know how long I have left. I wish for the chance to see my Noa at home, her mother said, calling on US President Joe Biden to push for her daughters release. A spokesperson for Ichilov Hospital in Tel Aviv confirmed on Saturday that Argamani had been transferred there so that she could be treated alongside her mother. Argamanis family had previously received signs that she was still alive. She appeared in a series of Hamas propaganda videos released in January this year. Video showed Argamani embracing her father after her release. She also held a phone call with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu who told her we didnt give up on you for a moment. Of the others freed:  Almog Meir Jan, 22, is from the small city of Or Yehuda, outside Tel Aviv. He was due to start a new job at a technology company on October 8.  Shlomi Ziv, 41, was working as a security guard at the Nova festival when he was kidnapped on October 7. Ziv had been living in the local moshav or agricultural settlement for 17 years with his wife Miren.  Andrey Kozlov, 27, is a Russian citizen who move to Israel a year ago. He was also working as a security guard at the Nova festival. We cant forget the others Relatives of the rescued hostages said they felt happy and blessed to be reunited with their loved ones but also called on the Israeli government to bring back the remaining captives. I couldnt stop hugging him, Orit Meir, mother of Almog Meir Jan, told a news conference Saturday. Tomorrow is my birthday so I got my present. Meir thanked the Israeli military and government for the rescue, but also urged the government to secure the release of the dozens of captives that remained in Gaza. We want a deal now. We want them to come back home as soon as possible, she said. Jennifer Master, the girlfriend of Andrey Kozlov, echoed those sentiments, saying, Thank you for saving our loved ones. And we wish that all the loved ones will come back home safe and sound and there will be a deal soon. Yaakov Argamani, father of Noa Argamani, added: We cant forget there are 120 hostages. We must do everything, but everything, as soon as possible to bring them home, so that their families can embrace them in happiness. Rozi Ziv, mother of Shlomi Ziv, said, My dream came true. I wish for the other hostages that their dreams will come true, too. Meanwhile, following news of the rescue, thousands of demonstrators gathered across Israel, calling on the government to secure a deal to free the remaining hostages. In Tel Aviv, demonstrators gathered at a plaza informally known as Hostages Square, many holding up pictures of the hostages with signs that read, Bring them home now. Earlier, the crowd cheered the Israeli military for its rescue operation. Many are calling for new elections, calling for Netanyahus government to step down. Source: CNN --Agencies",

        "content": "British TV presenter and healthy living advocate Michael Mosley has been found dead in a rocky area on the Greek island of Symi, just metres away from his destination, local mayors told Reuters on Sunday. Mosley, 67, had been missing since Wednesday after he went for a walk alone along a coastal path in searing heat. It is certainly him, said deputy mayor Nikitas Grillis, pending formal identification. Police spokeswoman Constantina Dimoglidou earlier said that the body of a person believed to be Mosley had been found in the area of Agia Marina, north of the village of Pedi and opposite the northeast beach of Agios Nikolaos where Mosley set out for his walk. Another police official said his body had been found on rocky terrain, close to the sea. Symi Mayor Lefteris Papakalodoukas said the discovery was made after he and others, including state ERT TV journalists, were filming the area from a vessel. We analysed the recorded evidence and it was obvious that it was, unfortunately, Mosley, Papakalodoukas said. He was found 10 metres away from the sea, 10-15 metres from his destination, the beach of Agia Marina, between a fence and a path. State TV ERT reported that he was found lying face up with his head on a rock. It is unclear if he had an accident or if he felt unwell, Papakalodoukas said. The coast guard and fire fighters had been deployed to the scene, a Reuters witness said. A coroner was on his way to Symi in a coast guard vessel, said a police official, adding that the body would be transferred to the neighbouring island of Rhodes. Mosley, who was on the island with his wife, was last seen alive at 1:30 p.m. (1030 GMT) on Wednesday. His children arrived in Symi on Friday. Symi, part of the Dodecanese island chain, is about 10 miles (16 km) long and has 2,500 residents. Mosley has appeared on British programmes including the BBC series Trust Me, Im a Doctor, the BBCs The One Show and ITVs This Morning. He popularised the 5:2 diet, which endorses intermittent fasting. Saleyha Ahsan, a doctor who worked with Mosley at the BBC gave her heartfelt condolences to Mosleys family. He lived and breathed his work, she told Sky News. He was an inspiration. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "date": "June 9, 2024 07:46 pm",
        "content": "(AP)  Narendra Modi was sworn in Sunday for a rare third consecutive term as Indias prime minister, relying on his coalition partners after his party failed to win a parliamentary majority in a surprise outcome. Modi and his Cabinet ministers took the oath of office, administered by President Droupadi Murmu, at Indias presidential palace Rashtrapati Bhavan in New Delhi. The 73-year-old popular but polarizing leader is only the second Indian prime minister after Jawaharlal Nehru to retain power for a third five-year term. His Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, which won by landslides in 2014 and 2019, failed to secure a majority to govern on its own in the latest national election. However, Modis National Democratic Alliance coalition won enough seats to form a government, with him at the helm. This is the first time the BJP under Modi has needed support from its regional allies to form a government after a decade of commanding the majority in Parliament. Final election results released Wednesday showed Modis BJP won 240 seats, well below the 272 needed for a majority. Together, the parties in the NDA coalition secured 293 seats in the 543-member lower house of Parliament. Modis coalition government now largely depends on two key regional allies  the Telugu Desam Party in southern Andhra Pradesh state and Janata Dal (United) in eastern Bihar state  to stay in power. Meanwhile, Modis political challenger, the INDIA alliance led by the resurgent Congress party, put up a stronger-than-expected fight, doubling its strength from the last election to win 232 seats. An avowed Hindu nationalist, the prime minister is considered a champion of the countrys Hindu majority, who make up 80 of Indias 1.4 billion population. His supporters credit him with rapid economic growth and improving Indias global standing since coming to power. But critics say hes also undermined Indias democracy and its status as a secular nation with attacks by Hindu nationalists against the countrys minorities, particularly Muslims, and a shrinking space for dissent and free media. His political opponents have questioned his governments economic record, pointing to high unemployment and growing inequality despite strong growth. Several South Asian leaders attended the swearing-in ceremony Sunday, including Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, Sri Lankan President Ranil Wickremesinghe, Nepalese Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal and Maldives President Mohamed Muizzu. Tensions between India and Maldives have grown since Muizzu was elected last year. He has since taken a pro-China stance and removed Indian troops stationed on one of Maldives islets.

        "content": "In a major bust, customs officials at Chennai airport seized 13.5 kg of gold worth INR 85 million from a Sri Lankan passenger who arrived from Singapore on Saturday evening, Indian media reported today. The passenger, a 29-year-old Sri Lankan man, was attempting to smuggle the gold into India. He had hidden the gold in a parcel and was trying to pass it off as a legitimate shipment, DT Next reported. The customs officials became suspicious when the passenger, who had travelled on an IndiGo flight, tried to pass through the green channel without declaring the gold. When they searched his luggage, they found the gold, which was worth INR 85 million. This is one of the largest gold seizures at the Chennai airport in recent times the report said. The passenger was arrested along with an Indigo airline staff member who was involved in the smuggling operation, it said. Investigation revealed that the passenger was part of a large gold smuggling syndicate and had been taking the help of the airline staff member to help him smuggle gold into India. Meanwhile, Indian customs officials are reportedly investigating how the passenger managed to get past earlier security checks while carrying large amounts of gold. Source: DT Next --Agencies",

        "title": "Macron dissolves French parliament and calls elections after big EU vote defeat",
        "date": "June 10, 2024 07:58 am",
        "content": "(AP)  President Emmanuel Macron dissolved the lower house of Frances parliament in a surprise announcement sending voters back to the polls in the coming weeks to choose lawmakers, after his party was handed a humbling defeat by the far-right in the European elections Sunday. The legislative elections will take place in two rounds on June 30 and July 7. The announcement came after the first projected results from France put the far-right National Rally party well ahead in the European Unions parliamentary elections, handing a chastening loss to Macrons pro-European centrists, according to French opinion poll institutes. Marine Le Pens anti-immigration, nationalist party was estimated to get around 31-32 of the votes, a historic result more than double the share of Macrons Renaissance party, which was projected to reach around 15. Macron himself wasnt a candidate in the EU elections and his term as president still runs for three more years. He said the decision was serious but showed his confidence in our democracy, in letting the sovereign people have their say. In the next few days, Ill be saying what I think is the right direction for the nation. Ive heard your message, your concerns, and I wont leave them unanswered, he said. In latest legislative elections in 2022, Macrons centrist party won the most seats but lost its majority at the National Assembly, forcing lawmakers into political maneuvering to pass bills. With Sundays decision, he is taking a big risk with a move that could backfire and increase the chances of Le Pen to eventually take power. A scenario in which an opposition party would eventually win a parliament majority could lead to a fraught power-sharing situation called cohabitation, with Macron to name a prime minister with different views. Le Pen, who head the National Rally group at the National Assembly, welcomed Macrons move. Were ready for it, said Le Pen, who was the runner-up to Macron in the last two presidential elections. Were ready to exercise power if the French people place their trust in us in these future legislative elections. Were ready to turn the country around, ready to defend the interests of the French, ready to put an end to mass immigration, ready to make the purchasing power of the French a priority. The EU elections results were a hard blow for Macron, who has been advocating for Europe-wide efforts to defend Ukraine and the need for the EU to boost its own defenses and industry. The National Rallys lead candidate for the EU elections, Jordan Bardella, campaigned for limiting free movement of migrants by carrying out national border controls and dialing back EU climate rules. The party no longer wants to leave the EU and the euro, but aims to weaken it from within. Tonight, our compatriots have expressed a desire for change, Bardella said. Emmanuel Macron is tonight a weakened president. An official at Macrons office said the decision to dissolve the National Assembly was justified by the historic score of the far-right that could not be ignored and the current parliamentarian disorder. Youre never wrong when you give the people a say, said the official, who spoke anonymously in line with the practice of Macrons office. EU elections projections also show a resurgence of the Socialist Party, with about 14 of the votes. The party campaigned on more ambitious climate policies and protections for European businesses and workers, with about 14 of the votes. Reacting to Macrons announcement, far-left politician Francois Ruffin called on all leaders from the left, including the Greens to unite under a single Popular Front banner. To avoid the worse, to win, he wrote on X. France is electing 81 members of the European Parliament, which has 720 seats in total. Source: AP --Agencies",

        "date": "June 10, 2024 10:51 am",
        "content": "Israeli minister Benny Gantz announced his resignation from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahus emergency government on Sunday, withdrawing the only centrist power in the embattled leaders far-right coalition amid a months-long war in Gaza. The departure of Gantzs centrist party will not pose an immediate threat to the government. But it could have a serious impact nonetheless, leaving Netanyahu reliant on hardliners, with no end in sight to the Gaza war and a possible escalation in fighting with Lebanese Hezbollah. Last month, Gantz presented Netanyahu with a June 8 deadline to come up with a clear day-after strategy for Gaza, where Israel has been pressing a devastating military offensive against the ruling Palestinian militant group Hamas. Netanyahu brushed off the ultimatum soon after it was given. On Sunday, Gantz said politics was clouding fateful strategic decisions in Netanyahus cabinet. Quitting while hostages were still in Gaza and soldiers fighting there was a excruciating decision, he said. Netanyahu is preventing us from advancing toward true victory, Gantz said in a televised news conference. That is why we are leaving the emergency government today, with a heavy heart but with full confidence. Netanyahu responded in a social media post, telling Gantz it was no time to abandon the battlefront. With Gantz gone, Netanyahu would lose the backing of a centrist bloc that has helped broaden support for the government in Israel and abroad, at a time of increasing diplomatic and domestic pressure eight months into the Gaza war. While his coalition remains in control of 64 of parliaments 120 seats, Netanyahu will now have to rely more heavily on the political backing of ultra-nationalist parties, whose leaders angered Washington even before the war and who have since called for a complete Israeli occupation of Gaza. This would likely increase strains already apparent in relations with the United States and intensify public pressure at home, with the months-long military campaign still not achieving its stated goals - the destruction of Hamas and the return of more than 100 remaining hostages held in Gaza. Polls have shown Gantz, a former army commander and defence minister, to be the most formidable political rival to Netanyahu, whose image as a security hawk was shattered by the Oct. 7 attack by Hamas on Israel. Warning that the conflict in Gaza could take years, he urged Netanyahu to agree on an election date in the autumn, to avoid further political infighting at a time of national emergency. Gantz joined a unity government soon after Oct. 7 as part of Netanyahus inner war cabinet where he, Netanyahu and Defence Minister Yoav Gallant alone had votes. On Sunday, Gantz described Gallant, who has sparred with Netanyahu and some ultra-nationalists ministers, as a brave leader and called on him to do the right thing, though he did not elaborate on what that meant. Far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir demanded Gantzs now vacant seat at the war cabinet soon after the resignation was announced. Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich said in a statement Gantz was giving Israels enemies what they want. Asked whether he was worried about his departure impacting Israels standing abroad, Gantz said Gallant and Netanyahu both know what should be done. Hopefully they will stick to what should be done and then it will be okay, he said. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "date": "June 10, 2024 04:28 pm",
        "content": "Prime Minister Giorgia Melonis arch-conservative Brothers of Italy group won the most votes in the European parliamentary election over the weekend, boosting her standing both at home and abroad. With almost all ballots counted, Brothers of Italy won 28.8of the vote, more than four times what it took in the last European Union election in 2019, and exceeding the 26 it secured in the 2022 national ballot, when it rose to power. I am proud that Italy will present itself to the G7, to Europe with the strongest government of all. This is something that has not happened in the past but is happening today, it is a satisfaction and also a great responsibility, Meloni said early on Monday from the partys headquarters. The opposition centre-left Democratic Party came in second with 24 of the vote, while another opposition group, the 5-Star Movement, was third with 9.9 - its worst showing at a countrywide level since its creation in 2009. The EU ballot indicated that Melonis ruling coalition, made up of parties that stretch from the centre-right to the far right of the political spectrum, saw its support climb to more than 47 from just under 43 in 2022. The results werent at all given, it is a resounding achievement and shows that all the parties of the majority have been able to grow together, Meloni said later in the morning on RTL 102.5 Radio. Its a spur for (the government) to move forward. Italians are giving us a loud and clear message to go ahead with our work ... and if possible with greater determination. Forza Italia, founded by the late Silvio Berlusconi, was in fourth place with 9.7 of the vote, surpassing the anti-immigrant League, which had 9.1, a disappointment for leader Matteo Salvini, who has pushed his party hard right, antagonising its old guard. Underscoring tensions in the League, party founder Umberto Bossi voted for Forza Italia this time around, his allies told Italian media this weekend, sending a jolt through the group. MELONI STRENGTH Melonis party traces its roots back to a neo-fascist group, and her 2022 victory set the tone for far-right gains across Europe, including in the latest EU ballot, which has seen the continent swing right. However, Meloni has moderated her image on the international stage, dropping her previous anti-EU rhetoric and presenting herself as a bridge between the mainstream centre-right and her own national conservative camp, which was previously shunned. Her strong showing on Sunday came in stark contrast to setbacks suffered by French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, whose parties were routed. Speaking on radio, Meloni said, however, it was still too early to say whether she would back a second term for centre-right European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. Her group of lawmakers might prove decisive should Meloni decide to back von der Leyen, potentially giving Rome leverage over the new EU executive. What we need is a Europe that will listen to citizens, that will look more to the centre-right and has more pragmatic and less ideological policies, Meloni said, adding that, given the results, Italy would necessarily have a fundamental role. Sunday also represented a big success for Melonis main opponent - Elly Schlein, who took charge of the centre-left PD party in 2023 and had struggled to impose her will on the old guard. The PD won 19 of the vote in 2022 and Schlein was anxious to improve on that. The hard left Green and Left Alliance won around 6.7, meaning that its candidate, Ilaria Salis, an Italian activist detained in Hungary for more than a year for allegedly assaulting far-right militants, is now an EU lawmaker. The one disappointment for all parties was the turnout, which was just below 50, initial data suggested, a record low in a country that has had historically strong voter participation.

        "date": "June 10, 2024 04:37 pm",
        "content": "The Supreme Court has ordered for a Fundamental Rights (FR) petition filed against Pastor Jerome Fernando to be taken up for consideration before a judge bench chaired by the Chief Justice. This order was issued when the relevant petition was taken up before a three-member Supreme Court judge bench consisting of Justices Murdhu Fernando, Kumudini Wickremasinghe and Janak De Silva today (10). Several religious leaders had filed this petition seeking an order to prosecute controversial Pastor Jerome Fernando under the United Nations International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) over his derogatory statements related to Lord Buddha and other religious figures. Appearing for the petitioning party, Presidents Counsel Sanjeewa Jayawardena informed the court that three of the religious leaders involved in filing the petition have expressed their willingness to withdraw it. Meanwhile, Senior Deputy Solicitor General Dileepa Peiris, who appeared on behalf of the Attorney General, informed the court that in accordance with the previous court order, all investigation reports conducted under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act regarding Pastor Jerome have been submitted to the court. After considering the facts, the judge bench ordered that since the relevant petition had previously been considered before the Chief Justice, it is appropriate to recall the case before a bench comprising the Chief Justice. Subsequently, the Supreme Court judge bench ordered the petition to be recalled before a bench chaired by the Chief Justice on July 22.",

        "title": "Apple expected to enter AI race with ambitions to overtake the early leaders",
        "date": "June 10, 2024 04:43 pm",
        "content": "Apples annual World Wide Developers Conference on Monday is expected to herald the companys move into generative artificial intelligence, marking its late arrival to a technological frontier thats expected to be as revolutionary as the invention of the iPhone. The widely anticipated display of AI to be embedded in the iPhone and other Apple products will be the marquee moment at an event that traditionally previews the next version of software that powers the companys hardware lineup. And Apples next generation of software is expected to be packed with an array of AI features likely to make its often-bumbling virtual assistant Siri smarter, and make photos, music, texting  and possibly even creating emojis on the fly  a more productive and entertaining experience. True to its secretive nature, Apple hasnt provided any advance details about Mondays event being held at the companys Cupertino, California, headquarters. But CEO Tim Cook has dropped strong hints during the first few months of this that Apple is poised to reveal its grand plans to enter a space that has been fueling an industry boom during the past 18 months. AI mania is the main reason that Nvidia, the dominant maker of the chips underlying the technology, has seen its market value rocket from about 300 billion at the end of 2022 to about 3 trillion. The meteoric ride allowed Nvidia to briefly surpass Apple last week as the second most valuable company in the U.S. Microsoft earlier this year also eclipsed the iPhone maker on the strength of its so-far successful push into AI. But analysts have been have been getting increasingly worried that Apple may be falling too far behind in the rapidly changing AI space, a concern that has been compounded by an uncharacteristically extended slump in the companys sales. Both Google and Samsung already have released smartphone models touting AI features as their main attractions. Thats why analysts such as Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities view Mondays conference as a potential springboard that catapults Apple into another robust phase of growth. Ives believes infusing more AI into the iPhone, iPad and Mac computer will translate into an additional 450 billon to 600 billion in market value for Apple. Mondays conference represents the most important event for Apple in over a decade as the pressure to bring a generative AI stack of technology for developers and consumers is front and center, Ives wrote in a research note. Apple definitely could use the boost that AI may be able to provide, particularly for its 13-year-old assistant Siri, which Forrester Research Dipanjan Chatterjee now calls an oddly unhelpful helper. Meanwhile, OpenAIs ChatGPT is getting increasingly conversational  so much so that it recently sparked accusations of intentionally copying a piece of AI software voiced by Scarlett Johansson  and Google last month previewed an AI agent dubbed Astra that can seemingly see and remember things. Besides using AI to spruce up Siri, Apple may also team up with OpenAI to bring some elements of ChatGPT to the iPhone, according to a wide range of unconfirmed reports leading up to Mondays conference. This will be the second straight year that Apple has created a stir at its developers conference by using it to usher in its entrance into a trendy form of technology that other companies already had been making inroads. Last year, Apple provided an early look at its mixed-reality headset, the Vision Pro, which wasnt released until early this year carrying a 3,500 price tag that has been a major impediment to gaining much traction. Nevertheless, Apples push into mixed reality, tweaked with a twist that it bills as spatial computing, has raised hopes that what is currently a niche technology will turn into a huge market. Part of the optimism stems from Apples history of releasing technology later than others and then using sleek designs and services combined with slick marketing campaigns to overcome its tardy start to unleash new trends. Apples early reticence toward AI was entirely on brand, Forresters Chatterjee wrote in a preview of the developers conference. The company has always been famously obsessed with what its offerings did for its customers rather than how it did it. Bringing more AI into the iPhone, in particular, will likely raise privacy issues  a topic where Apple has gone to great lengths to assure its loyal customer base that it can be trusted not to peer too deeply into their personal lives. One way Apple could reassure consumers that the iPhone wont be used to spy on them is to leverage its own chip technology so most AI-powered features are handled on the device itself instead of remote data centers, often called the cloud. Going that route also would help protect Apples profit margins because AI technology through the cloud is far more expensive than when it is run solely on a device.

        "content": "Howard University is cutting ties to Sean Diddy Combs, rescinding an honorary degree that was awarded to him and disbanding a scholarship program in his name, after a recently released 2016 video that appeared to show him attacking the RB singer Cassie. Mr. Combs behavior as captured in a recently released video is so fundamentally incompatible with Howard Universitys core values and beliefs that he is deemed no longer worthy to hold the institutions highest honor, a statement from the universitys Board of Trustees said. The statement said the board voted unanimously Friday to accept the return of the honorary degree Combs received in 2014. This acceptance revokes all honors and privileges associated with the degree. Accordingly, the Board has directed that his name be removed from all documents listing honorary degree recipients of Howard University, it said. The board also directed university administrators to cut financial ties to Combs, including returning a 1 million contribution, ending the scholarship program and dissolving a 2023 pledge agreement with the Sean Combs Foundation. An email seeking comment was sent to a Combs spokesperson by The Associated Press on Saturday. Combs admitted last month that he beat his ex-girlfriend Cassie in a hotel hallway in 2016 after CNN released video of the attack. In a video statement posted on social media, he said he was truly sorry and his actions were inexcusable. I take full responsibility for my actions in that video. I was disgusted then when I did it. Im disgusted now, Combs said. A lawsuit filed last year by Cassie, whose legal name is Cassandra Ventura, set off a wave of similar cases and public allegations against Combs. That lawsuit was settled. Source: AP --Agencies",

        "content": "Foreign Ministers of Sri Lanka and Maldives congratulated S Jaishankar on his second term as External Affairs Minister of India in the newly constituted cabinet of the BJP-led NDA government under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Sri Lankan Minister of Foreign Affairs Ali Sabry said that Jaishankars second term as EAM is a well-deserved recognition of his acumen in foreign relations. Sabry said he looks forward to working with him to enhance the ties between the two nations. In a post on X, Ali Sabry stated, Warmest congratulations DrSJaishankar on being reappointed Minister of External Affairs of India, a well-deserved recognition of your acumen in foreign relations. I look forward to working with you in enhancing the deep-rooted traditional cooperation between SriLanka  India. While congratulating Jaishankar on his reappointment as External Affairs Minister of India, Maldives Minister of Foreign Affairs Moosa Zameer said that he looked forward to closely working with him to enhance the ties between the two nations. Warm congratulations to DrSJaishankar on your reappointment as the Minister of External Affairs of India. I look forward to working closely with you to enhance our relationship, fostering greater cooperation and shared prosperity between our two countries, Moosa Zameer posted on X. The two leaders statement comes after BJP leader S Jaishankar, who took oath as Union Cabinet Minister on Sunday at the swearing-in ceremony at Rashtrapati Bhavan was named as the new External Affairs Minister in the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance government. Maldives President Mohamed Muizzu and Sri Lankan President Ranil Wickremesinghe also attended the swearing-in ceremony of PM Modi. Jaishankar served as External Affairs Minister during Prime Minister Narendra Modis second term from 2019-2024. He has been a BJP MP in Rajya Sabha from Gujarat since 2019. Jaishankar, who has made headlines for his witty replies and oratory skills, has been at the center stage in the team shaping Indias foreign policy for the past decade. Before being appointed as the External Affairs Minister in 2019, Jaishankar also served as Indias Foreign Secretary from 2015 to 2018. Notably, he also became the first Foreign Secretary to assume the role of External Affairs Minister. Jaishankars tenure which began in 2019 as Indias EAM came amid massive uncertainties owing to global turbulence and conflicts. His tenure saw episodes like the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the Israel-Hamas war, and the Covid pandemic, all of which left a strong impact on not just the Indian economy but also that of the whole world. But, during these turbulent times, Indias stand was marked by the priority of Nation First. Regarding the Russia-Ukraine conflict, India has always condemned civilian killings and called for a peaceful resolution to the conflict. However, despite pressure from the West, India has not refrained from purchasing Russian oil below the price cap. In the Israel-Hamas war, India strongly condemned the October 7 attack. However, India has also continued with its weight behind the two-state solution to the long-running Israel-Palestine conflict. India has also sent humanitarian aid to the people of Gaza as part of its commitment. Jaishankar, who entered Indias Foreign Service in 1977, has served as Indias envoy in several prominent countries such as the United States (2013-15) and China (2009-13). He also served as Indias Ambassador to Czech Republic (2000-04) and Indian High Commissioner to Singapore (2007-09). Previously, he had also served as third secretary and second secretary at the Indian Embassy in the Soviet Union (before the disintegration of the Soviet Union). Jaishankar also worked as an undersecretary in the Ministry of External Affairs Americas Division. Source  ANI --Agencies",

The Malawi Defence Force aircraft went off the radar after it left the capital, Lilongwe, on Monday morning, it added. The plane was supposed to land at Mzuzu International Airport, in the countrys north, just after 10:00 local time (09:00 BST). In a speech late on Monday, President Lazarus Chakwera said a search and rescue operation was continuing. Soldiers are still on the ground carrying out the search and I have given strict orders that the operation should continue until the plane is found, he said, adding that it was a heart-breaking situation. I know that we are all frightened and concerned - I too am concerned. But I want to assure you that I am sparing no available resource to find that plane and I am holding onto every fibre of hope that we will find survivors. Mr Chakwera earlier cancelled his flight to the Bahamas, which was scheduled for Monday evening. The reason for the aircrafts disappearance is not yet known, General Valentino Phiri told Mr Chakwera. Moses Kunkuyu, Malawis information minister, told the BBC efforts to find the aircraft are intensive. Mr Chilima was on his way to represent the government at the burial of former cabinet minister Ralph Kasambara, who died three days ago. Mr Kunkuyu said: The airport he was to land, which is in the northern part of Mzuzu, was the closest to where the funeral was taking place. In 2022, Dr Chilima was arrested and charged on allegations that he accepted money in exchange for awarding government contracts . Last month, the court dropped the charges, giving no reasons for this decision. Who is Saulos Chilima? Prior to his political career, Dr Chilima held key leadership roles in multinational companies like Unilever and Coca Cola He is 51 years old He is married with two children Dr Chilima is described on the governments website as a performer, workaholic and an achiever He holds a PhD in Knowledge Management Source: BBC --Agencies",

        "date": "June 11, 2024 11:45 am",
        "content": "Four American educators from a small Iowa university were injured in a stabbing attack in a public park in northeast Chinas Jilin province on Monday, according to U.S. media and U.S. government officials. Iowa Representative Adam Zabner told Reuters his brother was one of the victims. My brother, David Zabner, was wounded in the arm during a stabbing attack while visiting a temple in Jilin City, China, he said. The group had been visiting a temple in Beishan Park when they were attacked by a man with a knife, he added. There were no reports of a motive. A video of people lying on the ground in a park covered in blood were circulating on X on Monday, though no trace of the images could be found on Chinese social media. Reuters was able to identify the location based on Chinese characters written on a wall, the walls structure and the layout of the path. Reuters was not able to confirm when the video was shot. No statements on the incident have been issued by Chinese authorities or reports found in Chinese media. I spoke to David a few minutes ago, he is recovering from his injuries and doing well. My family is incredibly grateful that David survived this attack, Adam Zabner said. The educators from Cornell College were visiting a partner university, Beihua, in Jilin City. We are working through proper channels and requesting to speak with the U.S. Embassy on appropriate matters to ensure that the victims first receive quality care for their injuries and then get out of China in a medically feasible manner, Iowas Congress representative Mariannette Miller-Meeks wrote on X. Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds wrote on X that she was in touch with the U.S. State Department on the horrifying attack. College spokesperson Jen Visser told CNN the U.S. State Department was aware of reports of a stabbing incident in China and was monitoring the situation. Chinas President Xi Jinping this year pledged to invite 50,000 young Americans to China for study programmes to boost people-to-people ties, but a State Department Level 3 travel advisory to China warning of possible arbitrary detention and exit bans remains in place. There are currently fewer than 900 American exchange students studying in China compared to over 290,000 Chinese students in the United States, according to U.S. data. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

Ordinary Level (OL) and Advanced Level (AL) examinations will be expedited to facilitate faster university enrollment for students. The goal is to enable students to complete their schooling by the age of 18 and seamlessly transition into higher education. Speaking at a ceremony recognizing the top achievers of the G.C.E. Advanced Level Examination, Minister Premajayantha highlighted the reforms aimed at minimizing delays in the educational timeline. He emphasized that AL studies will now begin before the release of OL results, allowing for continuous academic progress without the previous 4-5 month gap traditionally experienced between the two examination stages. Starting this year, the AL examination, which has typically been held in November, will be rescheduled to September by 2025. This change aims to streamline the process and reduce the waiting period for university admissions. Minister Premajayantha also expressed his commitment to enhancing the infrastructure and resources necessary for the effective implementation of these academic activities within schools and universities. The reforms are designed not only to accelerate the educational process but also to foster spaces for innovation and adaptability in a rapidly evolving technological landscape. He underscored the importance of equipping students with knowledge and experience in emerging fields such as artificial intelligence and highlighted the need to develop a legal framework to govern the use of such technologies within the educational system.

That kind of update, according to Musk, would be an unacceptable security violation. Its patently absurd that Apple isnt smart enough to make their own AI, yet is somehow capable of ensuring that OpenAi will protect your security and privacy! Musk wrote in a social media post. Visitors to X headquarters in San Francisco would also have to check their Apple devices at the door, where they will be stored in a Faraday cage, Musk added on the platform, referencing a type of container that stops signals from coming in and out. ChatGPT will be integrated into Siri and a new update called Writing Tools, where artificial intelligence (AI) will help you find the right words virtually everywhere you write, according to Apples announcement. Siri requests made by users, including any documents and photos, can also be sent to ChatGPT for help. Any requests made to OpenAI through Apples Siri and Writing Tools are not stored and IP addresses will be obscured, an announcement from OpenAI continued. Privacy is integrated into the core of Apple products to protect users at every step, a statement from Apple said. Its aware of your personal information without collecting it. Apple shares our commitment to safety and innovation, and this partnership aligns with OpenAIs mission to make advanced AI accessible to everyone, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said in a statement announcing the companies new partnership. Musk was one of the co-founders of OpenAI in 2015 but stepped down from the board in 2018. Lately, hes been an outspoken critic of the AI giant, launching a lawsuit against OpenAI earlier this year. The suit alleges OpenAI abandoned the companys founding mission of developing AI for the benefit of humanity. In May, Musk raised 6 billion (5.5 billion) for his AI competitor, xAI. Grok, its main product, is modeled after the Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy, where it can answer almost anything. The ChatGPT and Apple partnership is coming later this year with free software updates for users of the latest iPhone, iPad and Mac products. Source: Euronews.com --Agencies",

        "date": "June 11, 2024 04:57 pm",
        "content": "Malawis vice president and nine others were killed in a plane crash, the countrys president said Tuesday. The wreckage of the military plane carrying Vice President Saulos Chilima was located in a mountainous area in the north of the country after a search that lasted more than a day. There were no survivors of the crash, Malawian President Lazarus Chakwera said in a live address on state television. Hundreds of soldiers, police officers and forest rangers had been searching for the plane that also carried a former first lady after it went missing Monday morning while making the 45-minute flight from the southern African nations capital, Lilongwe, to the city of Mzuzu, around 370 kilometers (230 miles) to the north. Air traffic controllers told the plane not to attempt a landing at Mzuzus airport because of bad weather and poor visibility and asked it to turn back to Lilongwe, Chakwera said. Air traffic control then lost contact with the aircraft and it disappeared from radar, he said. Seven passengers and three military crew members were on board. The president described the aircraft as a small, propeller driven plane operated by the Malawian armed forces. The tail number he provided shows it is a Dornier 228-type twin propeller plane that was delivered to the Malawian army in 1988, according to the ch-aviation website that tracks aircraft information. Around 600 personnel were involved in the search in a vast forest plantation in the Viphya Mountains near Mzuzu, authorities said. Chilima was serving his second term as vice president. He was also in the role from 2014-2019 under former President Peter Mutharika. He was a candidate in the 2019 Malawian presidential election and finished third, behind the incumbent, Mutharika, and Chakwera. The vote was later annulled by Malawis Constitutional Court because of irregularities. Chilima then joined Chakweras campaign as his running mate in a historic election rerun in 2020, when Chakwera was elected president. It was the first time in Africa that an election result that was overturned by a court resulted in a defeat for the sitting president. Chilima had previously been facing corruption charges over allegations that he received money in return for influencing the awarding of government procurement contracts for the Malawi armed forces and the police, but prosecutors dropped the charges last month. He had denied the allegations, but the case led to criticism that Chakweras administration was not taking a hard enough stance against graft. Source: AP --Agencies",

        "date": "June 11, 2024 06:18 pm",
        "content": "A new attraction starring the first Black Disney princess is opening at the companys U.S. theme park resorts, and some Disney followers see it as a fitting replacement to a former ride based on a movie that contained racist tropes. The new theme park attraction updates Tianas storyline from the 2009 animated film The Princess and the Frog and is opening this year in the space previously occupied by Splash Mountain. The water ride had been themed to Song of the South, a 1946 Disney movie filled with racist cliches about African Americans and plantation life. Tianas Bayou Adventure keeps Splash Mountains DNA as a log-flume ride, but its infused with music, scenery and animatronic characters inspired by Princess, set in 1920s New Orleans. It opens to the public later this month at Walt Disney World in Florida and at Disneyland in California later this year. For little Black girls, Tiana has meant a lot. When a little child can see somebody who looks like them, that matters, said Neal Lester, an English professor at Arizona State University, who has written about Tiana. Disneys announcement that it would transform its longstanding Splash Mountain ride into Tianas Bayou Adventure was made in June 2020 following the social justice protests sparked by the murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis police custody. At the time, Disney said the change had already been in the works. But it came as companies across the U.S. were reconsidering or renaming decades-old brands amid worldwide protests. The Song of the South film is a mix of live action, cartoons and music featuring an older Black man who works at a plantation and tells fables about talking animals to a white city boy. The film has been criticized for its racist stereotypes, hasnt been released in theaters in decades and isnt available on the companys streaming service Disney.

The film has been criticized for its racist stereotypes, hasnt been released in theaters in decades and isnt available on the companys streaming service Disney. Imagineers who design the Disney rides are always attempting to look at the attractions with fresh eyes and ways to tell new stories so that everybody feels included, said Carmen Smith, a senior vice president for creative development at Walt Disney Imagineering. We never want to perpetuate stereotypes or misconceptions, Smith said Monday. Our intention is to tell great stories. Its also important for the Imagineers to tell a variety of stories for its global audience, said Charita Carter, an executive creative producer at Walt Disney Imagineering who oversaw the development of the attraction. Society does change, and we develop different sensibilities, Carter said. We focus our stories differently depending what our society needs. The transformation from Splash Mountain to Tianas Bayou Adventure is one of several recalibrations at the entertainment giants theme parks for rides whose storylines are considered antiquated or offensive. In 2021, Disney announced it would remodel Jungle Cruise, one of the original Disney parks rides, which had been been criticized in years past for being racially insensitive because of its depiction of animatronic Indigenous people as savages or headhunters. Three years before that, Disney eliminated a Bride Auction scene, deemed offensive since it depicted women lining up for auction, from its Pirates of the Caribbean ride. Its a positive step for Disney to have a ride based on a character from a background not seen in previous versions of Disney princesses replacing an attraction from a film steeped in racist tropes since representation matters, Lester said. Disney is first and foremost about money and getting people into the park, and you can make money, still have representation and be aware of social justice history and make everyone feel like they belong there, Lester said.

Justice Anita Sumanth made it clear that a reasoned order must be passed on the citizenship application filed by Gajendiran, within 12 weeks, after seeking all necessary clarifications from the applicant and by following the applicable rules and regulations. The direction was issued while disposing of a writ petition filed by the refugee in 2023 seeking a direction to Indias Union Home Ministry to expedite his citizenship application pending since 2017. In his affdavit, the petitioner, now residing in Puducherry, had claimed to have entered India in 1990. He had obtained a bachelors degree in mathematics and completed his Masters in Business Administrtation too during his stay at the Keezhputhupet Rehabilitation Camp in Villupuram. He married an Indian on February 1, 2008 and was now the father of a nine-year-old child, the petitioners counsel L. Romeo Roy Alfred said. However, central government senior panel counsel G. Babu highlighted a discrepancy in the petitioners application. While the petitioner claims to be Gajendiran, a refugee certificate issued by the rehabiltation department of the Government of Tamil Nadu had identified him as R. Gajendrakumar, the law officer said.

Hunter Biden, 54, stared straight ahead and showed little emotion as the verdict was read after jury deliberations that lasted only three hours over two days in Wilmington, Delaware. He hugged his attorneys, smiled wanly and kissed his wife, Melissa, before leaving the courtroom with her. President Joe Biden said in a statement issued shortly after the verdict that he would accept the outcome and continue to respect the judicial process as Hunter considers an appeal. Now Hunter Biden and presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, the presidents chief political rival, have both been convicted by American jurors in an election year that has been as much about the courtroom as about campaign events and rallies. Hunter Biden faces up to 25 years in prison when he is sentenced by U.S. District Judge Maryellen Noreika, though as a first-time offender he would not get anywhere near the maximum, and theres no guarantee the judge would send him to prison. She did not set a sentencing date. Defense attorney Abbe Lowell said they would continue to vigorously pursue all the legal challenges available. In a written statement, Hunter Biden said he was disappointed by the outcome but grateful for the support of family and friends. The jurys decision was read swiftly after the announcement that it reached a verdict. First lady Jill Biden sat through nearly every day of the trial but did not make it into the courtroom in time to hear the verdict. Hunter Biden walked out of the courthouse holding hands with the first lady and his wife before they got into waiting SUVs and drove off. Joe Biden steered clear of the federal courtroom where his son was tried and said little about the case, wary of appearing to interfere in a criminal matter brought by his own Justice Department. But allies of the Democrat have worried about the toll that the trial  and now the conviction  will take on the 81-year-old, who has long been concerned with his only living sons health and sustained sobriety. Hunter Bidens conviction came just weeks after Trump was found guilty of 34 felony charges related to a hush money payment to a porn actor in the 2016 campaign. The cases are in no way the same, and Hunter Biden is a private citizen who is not running for office. But they have both argued they were victimized by the politics of the moment. Trump, however, has continued to falsely claim his verdict was rigged, while Joe Biden has said he would accept the verdict involving his son and would not seek to pardon him. In his statement Tuesday, the president said he and the first lady are proud of their son, who says he has been sober since 2019, and will always be there for him with love and support. Trumps campaign called the verdict nothing more than a distraction from the real crimes of the Biden Crime Family. Trump and his allies have pressed unsubstantiated or debunked allegations that Joe Biden acted while vice president to advance his family members foreign business interests. The verdict came down as the president prepared to give a speech at a conference hosted by the Everytown for Gun Safety Action Fund in Washington. He did not mention his son as he spoke about his administrations efforts to stop gun violence and the need to ban so-called assault weapons. Hours after the conviction, President Biden hugged his son after landing in Wilmington to spend the night with family before leaving Wednesday for the Group of Seven leaders conference in Italy. Hunter Biden, his wife and their child greeted the president on the tarmac, and the president lingered to visit with them for several minutes. Jurors found Hunter Biden guilty of lying to a federally licensed gun dealer, making a false claim on the application by saying he was not a drug user and illegally having the gun for 11 days. The trial played out in the presidents home state, where Hunter Biden grew up and where the family is deeply established. Joe Biden spent 36 years as a senator in Delaware, commuting daily to Washington, and his other son, Beau Biden, was the state attorney general before he died of cancer. The proceedings put a spotlight on a dark time in Hunter Bidens life, including his spiraling descent after Beaus death in 2015. The trial featured deeply personal testimony from former romantic partners and embarrassing evidence such as text messages and photos of Hunter Biden with drug paraphernalia or partially clothed. In his closing argument on Monday, prosecutor Leo Wise acknowledged the evidence was ugly. But he told jurors it was also absolutely necessary to prove Hunter was in the throes of addiction when he bought the gun and therefore lied when he checked no on the form that asked whether he was an unlawful user of, or addicted to drugs. Before the case went to the jury, the prosecutor urged jurors to pay no mind to members of the presidents family sitting in the courtroom, telling them: People sitting in the gallery are not evidence. David Weiss, the prosecutor who has led the long-running investigation into the presidents son, told reporters the case was about Hunter Bidens illegal choices and dangerous conduct. No one in this country is above the law, said Weiss, the Trump-nominated U.S. attorney for Delaware, who was named special counsel by Attorney General Merrick Garland in August. Everyone must be accountable for their actions. Hunter Bidens lawyers had argued that he did not consider himself an addict when he bought the gun. They sought to show he was trying to turn his life around at the time, having completed a rehabilitation program at the end of August 2018. Hunter Bidens legal troubles arent over. He faces a trial in September in California on charges of failing to pay 1.4 million in taxes, and congressional Republicans have signaled they will keep going after him in their stalled impeachment effort into the president. The president has not been accused or charged with any wrongdoing by prosecutors investigating his son. Just last year, it appeared that Hunter Biden would avoid the spectacle of a trial so close to the election. Under a deal with prosecutors, he was supposed to plead guilty to misdemeanor tax offenses and avoid prosecution in the gun case if he stayed out of trouble for two years. But the deal fell apart after Noreika, who was nominated by Trump, questioned unusual aspects of the proposed agreement, and the lawyers could not resolve the matter. Hunter Biden has said he was charged because the Justice Department bowed to pressure from Republicans who argued the Democratic presidents son was getting special treatment.

He commended the Presidents initiatives in resolving past congestion problems and reinstating regularity in civil life, declaring his support for the Presidents candidacy in the upcoming presidential election. Addressing a press briefing titled Collective Path to a Stable Country, held Tuesday (11) at the Presidential Media Centre (PMC) Fisheries Minister Douglas Devananda further said that, Today, stakeholders together with Port Authority, Navy officials, industry experts, local intellectuals, and community representatives convened to deliberate on the restoration and reactivation of Oluvil Port. Our focus is on preserving resources, enhancing port operations, and addressing community needs. The objective is to harness the ports potential for national development. Urgency is paramount as we strive to expedite progress toward our objectives. Additionally, President Ranil Wickremesinghe recently visited India to attend the Prime Ministers swearing-in ceremony, marking a successful tour. The President discussed the visits outcomes during a cabinet meeting, highlighting its economic significance for our country. It is anticipated that this visit will create numerous job opportunities for the youth of the country. Additionally, theres a concerning issue of Indian fishermen encroaching across our borders and employing illegal fishing gear, adversely impacting the livelihoods of our fishermen. During his recent visit to India, the President addressed this matter with the relevant Indian authorities. Furthermore, the upcoming visits of the Indian Prime Minister and the Indian Minister of Foreign Affairs to Sri Lanka will provide an opportunity to diplomatically address this fishing dispute and seek solutions. Concurrently, efforts are underway to enact new laws aimed at enhancing the fishing industry, safeguarding the interests of fishing communities, and preserving marine resources. The rise in fuel prices not only impacts fishermen but also consumers. Consequently, we are exploring the feasibility of offering fuel subsidies to fishermen, a matter under discussion with the President. Additionally, we prioritize aquatic industries and water management, particularly freshwater fish. In accordance with the Presidents directive to return lands acquired by the Department of Forest Conservation after 1985 to their rightful owners, an upcoming discussion, chaired by the Secretary to the President, will include the Minister of Forest Resources Conservation, District Secretaries of the five districts in the Northern Province, and relevant government officials. I have toured all 15 fishing districts of Sri Lanka to address the issues faced by fishermen in these areas. During these visits, residents have emphasized the importance of selecting a capable leader for our countrys future. President Ranil Wickremesinghe has made significant strides in alleviating economic crises, shortages of goods, and the long queues, thereby restoring normalcy to peoples lives. In light of his efforts, we express our readiness to collaborate with him and extend our support for his candidacy in the upcoming presidential election. Source: PMD",

        "content": "India says two of its nationals who had been recruited by the Russian army have been killed in the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. The Indian foreign ministry said it had urged the Russian authorities to repatriate the bodies of the two deceased. The ministry has also urged Moscow to quickly release and return all Indian nationals who are with the Russian army. Moscow is yet to comment. Dozens of Indians have reportedly been duped by agents into fighting for Russian forces with the lure of money and a Russian passport. The BBC has spoken to some of them. Some said they were coerced into taking up combat roles in the Russian army. Others have also enlisted of their own accord. We regret to state that two Indian nationals who had been recruited by the Russian Army have recently been killed in the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine, the foreign ministry statement said, without naming the victims. The ministry also urged Indian nationals to exercise caution while seeking employment opportunities in Russia. In May Indian police arrested four people allegedly linked to a network of human traffickers on suspicion of luring young men to Russia with the promise of jobs or education, only to force them to fight in Ukraine. At least two other Indians died earlier this year while fighting for Russian forces. Despite urging Russia to return Indian nationals serving in the Russian army, India has refused to condemn the Kremlin over its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, urging the two sides to seek peace through dialogue and diplomacy. Meanwhile Nepal and Sri Lanka have warned their citizens not to be lured in by the false promises of human traffickers in recent months, after it emerged that hundreds of their nationals were taking part in the war as mercenaries. Kathmandu says at least 20 Nepalese have died fighting for Russia. At least 16 former Sri Lankan soldiers have been killed in the conflict so far, most of them for the Russian army. Sri Lankan Foreign Minister Ali Sabry raised the issue with his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov in Moscow on Monday, the ministry said. It was agreed that no further recruitment from Sri Lanka will be done, the ministry said. Source: BBC --Agencies",

        "date": "June 12, 2024 10:34 am",
        "content": "An international tribunal of prominent judges from the region said it was horrified by the stark realities of the lives of Sri Lankas tea and rubber plantation workers, after hearing testimonies from workers and trade unions. Hailing from the island nations Malaiyaha Tamil community, tens of thousands of workers are engaged in tea and rubber production. They earn vital foreign exchange for the country that is struggling to rebuild its economy after the dramatic meltdown of 2022. Last year, Sri Lankas revenue from tea exports totalled 1.3 billion, while rubber-based exports fetched 930 million, according to the Export Development Board. However, the workers who toil in the countrys plantations continue to work and live in abysmal conditions. It has shocked the conscience of the Tribunal that such practices could continue unabated in the modern civilized world, members said in their findings, echoing concerns that trade unions, local activists, and UN experts have flagged in the past. Organised by the Ceylon Workers Red Flag Union, a trade union based in the islands central Kandy district, the Tribunal heard 11 workers employed in tea and rubber plantations across central and southern Sri Lanka, as well as three trade union representatives last week. Testifying before the tribunal  with Justice A.P. Shah from India, Justice P.K. Pawan Kumar Ojha from Nepal and Justice Shiranee Tilakawardane from Sri Lanka as its members  the workers, mostly women, shared the multiple challenges they encounter at work, such as the demanding targets tied to their daily wage and the absence of basic sanitation facilities. Leech bites and wasp attacks are common, while medical care remains out of reach, more so amid soaring living costs following the countrys crisis. Speaking of her family being forced to ration meals to cut down expenses, a worker employed in tea plantations for over 20 years, said: Let alone having three meals, I have not been able to afford a cup of tea with milk in years. If at all I can, it is plain tea once in a way. In his remarks at the conclusion of the hearing, Justice Shah noted: they live practically a sub-human life, and certainly do not have a life of dignity. On May 1, 2024, President Ranil Wickremesinghe announced an increase in the daily wage of plantation workers to LKR 1,700 (roughly 468). Plantation companies vehemently opposed the move and petitioned Sri Lankas Court of Appeal, seeking an order invalidating the gazette on the wage hike. But the court refused to stay the gazette notification. Workers, however, remain sceptical. From 2021, the workers have been entitled to a daily wage of LKR 1,000, but they rarely earned that amount. The targets introduced by employers are unrealistic and impossible to meet, according to workers. A recent study led by University of Peradeniya Economist Prof. S. Vijesandiran, estimated that the total household expenditure for a tea estate workers family of four, as of April 2024, would be LKR 86,897.71 (roughly 23,913) for a decent life in the context of the cost of living and inflation effect as of September 2022. That would mean that a worker must earn at least LKR 2,321.04 (around 638.71) a day. Observing that the daily wage was at the heart of the problems faced by workers, the Tribunal noted that workers experience abysmal pay, extremely slow progression in wage increase and blatant non-implementation of wage increases. The Tribunal recommended that all measures be taken by stakeholders, including the State, to execute in letter and spirit, without delay, the minimum wage of Rs 1,700 fixed by the government.. Further, it urged the Sri Lankan government to prohibit all unfair practices adopted by the plantation companies, such as reducing days of work, arbitrarily increasing daily targets, and informalising labour to deprive workers of their right to receive the minimum, statutorily fixed wage.

        "content": "Sri Lankas digital literacy has increased to 63.5 in the year 2023, according to the latest report by the Department of Census and Statistics. This means that three out of five persons aged between 5 and 69 in Sri Lanka are digitally literate. Additionally, two out of five persons aged between 5 and 69 in Sri Lanka are computer literate, the report by the Department of Census and Statistics highlighted. Accordingly, Sri Lankas computer literacy rate in 2023 has increased to 39.0 compared to the rate of 16.1 in the 2006  2007 period. The findings also indicate that the computer literacy rate of males in Sri Lanka is 40.9 while in females the rate was indicated as 37.2 in 2023. The highest computer literacy rate is reported among the age group of 15  19. The computer literacy rate in this age group was recorded as 79.4, while the number was mentioned as 74.7 in the age group of 20  24.

        "date": "June 12, 2024 03:00 pm",
        "content": "Minister of Foreign Affairs Ali Sabry, delivering his statement at the BRICS Foreign Ministers meeting, stated that Global South should collectively address global challenges of climate change, debt burden and food security, the Sri Lankan Embassy in Moscow said in a statement. He further stressed that the architecture of global governance, established in the aftermath of World War II has achieved significant milestones. However, that it was increasingly evident that this structure must evolve to reflect the contemporary realities of our world, he added. The Foreign Minister highlighted that voices and interests of emerging economies and developing nations must be integrated more fully into the decision-making processes of international institutions, the statement added. Emphasizing the need for the rules based order, the Foreign Minister stated that it is imperative that we strive hard to ensure a rules-based order, not only when it suits the rich and powerful, but as an equitable and justifiable model for a sustainable world order. This means upholding international law and ensuring the principles of fairness, justice, and respect for sovereignty guide our actions. Only then can we create a world where all nations, regardless of their size or power, have a fair opportunity to thrive. While underscoring the important and effective role of the regional organizations in shaping the world order, Minister Sabry who also spoke in his capacity as chairman of the Indian Ocean RIM Association (IORA) said IORA can serve as a platform for fostering regional cooperation and advancing the shared goals of sustainable development and security. The Minister, while referring to the plight of the citizens of Gaza said that it is the duty of the Global South to get together and ensure the justice for helpless and defenseless population of Gaza particularly women and children and rescuing them from total annihilation. Minister of Foreign Affairs Ali Sabry undertook an official visit to Russia at the invitation of his counterpart, Sergey Lavrov, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation from 10-11 June 2024 to attend the BRICS Foreign Ministers meeting with the developing countries held in Nizhny Novgorod, Russia. The meeting was attended by high level representatives of 22 countries including 17 Foreign Ministers. Foreign Minister Sabry also met with Foreign Ministers of the Russian Federation, Belarus, Iran and Kazakhstan on the sidelines of the meeting, it added. During the meeting with the Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, the two Ministers reviewed the multifaceted engagements between the two countries and agreed to further enhance relations in trade, education, tourism and regional cooperation including interactions in IORA. Being a Dialogue Partner of IORA, Russian Foreign Minister reaffirmed Russias fullest support for Sri Lankas chairmanship of IORA. Minister Sabry also met the Iranian Acting Foreign Minister Dr. Ali Bagheri Kani and agreed to fully implement the consensus reached between President Wickremesinghe and the late Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi during his recent State Visit to Sri Lanka. In addition, Minister Sabry also met Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Kazakhstan Murat Nurtleu. Both Ministers discussed avenues for further strengthening bilateral cooperation in trade, tourism, energy, transportation, multilateral and regional fora. Kazakhstan welcomed Sri Lankas decision to establish the first Sri Lankan Mission in Central Asia in Astana following the decision made by the two Presidents to establish diplomatic missions in the two countries. Foreign Minister Nurtleu also expressed hope that Kazakhstan would also reciprocate in establishing an Embassy in Sri Lanka in the near future. During the meeting with the Belarusian Minister of Foreign Affairs Sergei Aleinik, the two Ministers agreed on the importance of early convening of the political consultations and Joint Commission on Trade and Economic Cooperation between the two countries towards further consolidating the existing friendly ties. The Foreign Ministers also recognized the friendly relations and the robust people to people exchanges between Sri Lanka and Belarus, according to the Sri Lankan Embassy in Moscow.

        "content": "A fire that broke out in a building housing workers in the city of Mangaf in southern Kuwait early on Wednesday has killed at least 41 people, the countrys deputy prime minister Sheikh Fahad Yusuf Saud Al-Sabah said during a visit to the site. The deputy PM accused real estate owners of violations and greed, saying those factors contributed towards the incident. Unfortunately, the greed of real estate owners is what leads to these matters, said Sheikh Fahad, who also runs the interior and defense ministries. The fire was reported to authorities at 6:00 a.m. local time (0300 GMT), Major General Eid Rashed Hamad said. The building in which the fire occurred was used to house workers, and there was a large number of workers there. Dozens were rescued, but unfortunately there were many deaths as a result of inhaling smoke from the fire, another senior police commander told state TV. We always alert and warn against cramming too many workers into housing accommodation, he said, without providing details on the workers type of employment or place of origin. The fire was contained and authorities were investigating its cause, officials said. More than 35 people were killed and dozens injured in a building fire in an area heavily populated with foreign workers in Kuwait, the interior ministry said on Wednesday.

        "date": "June 12, 2024 04:37 pm",
        "content": "One of Frances best-loved singer-songwriters, Françoise Hardy, has died at the age of 80. Mum is gone, her son, Thomas Dutronc, who is also a musician, wrote on social media. Hardy burst on to the music scene in 1962 and became a cultural icon who inspired the likes of Mick Jagger and Bob Dylan. Known for her melancholy ballads, she symbolised Frances Yé-yé (yeah yeah) pop movement, so-called because of its nod to English music. Her most famous songs included All the Girls and Boys (Tous les garçons et les filles), It Hurts to Say Goodbye (Comment te dire adieu) and My Friend the Rose (Mon amie la rose). Her biggest UK hit was All Over The World, an English-language version of her song Dans le monde entier, which reached number 16 in the charts in June 1965. Hardy was born in Nazi-occupied Paris in 1944 and raised by her mother. Like many girls at the time, she grew up listening to Elvis Presley, Cliff Richard and other American and British stars on Radio Luxembourg and she signed her first record deal at just 17. Her breakout as a musician came in 1962 with the simple, plaintive song, Tous les garçons et les filles, when she sang of all the boys and girls walking hand in hand, while I walk alone through the streets, my heart aching. It was an instant hit in France and even broke through in the UK charts. Her style captivated fashion designers, becoming a model for the likes of Yves Saint Laurent and Paco Rabanne, who designed a minidress out of gold plates for her. Rolling Stones frontman Mick Jagger once famously called her the ideal woman, while fellow singer-songwriter Bob Dylan penned several love letters to her. He addressed her in a poem on the back of his 1964 album Another Side of Bob Dylan. One of her most memorable performances came in 1968 with Comment te dire adieu, a French adaptation by Serge Gainsbourg of a song originally in English. But the Gainsbourg song has since been covered many times, with its painful goodbye to a man with a heart of pyrex. She collaborated with a number of artists, including Blur and Iggy Pop. Hardy was also an actor - appearing in films by directors including Jean-Luc Godard, Roger Vadim and John Frankenheimer - as well as a writer of fiction and non-fiction. Among the topics she wrote about was astrology, which she developed a love for during the 1970s. She was married once, to the singer Jacques Dutronc, with whom she had her son Thomas. They separated in the late 1980s, but she would often refer to her ex-husband as the love of her life. Hardy had been ill for some time before her death, revealing in 2004 that she had been diagnosed with lymphoma. In 2015, she was placed in an induced coma for weeks following a fall and in 2021, she said she had cancer in one of her ears and felt close to the end of her life. Her career spanned more than five decades, during which she released nearly 30 albums. Hardys last album, Personne DAutre (Nobody Else), was released in 2018. Rolling Stone ranked her at number 162 on its list of the 200 Greatest Singers of All Time in 2023. Among those to pay tribute to Hardy following news of her death was Frances Culture Minister, Rachida Dati, who wrote on social media: How to say goodbye to her? Eternal Françoise Hardy, legend of French song, who entered, through her sensitivity and her melodies, into the heart of an entire country. Source: BBC --Agencies",

        "title": "President hits out at politicians making promises without presenting any economic policies",
        "date": "June 12, 2024 05:47 pm",
        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe states that at present, certain politicians are making extensive promises without presenting any concrete policies to drive the countrys economic growth. Speaking during a dialogue with Youth Representatives of the Parliamentary Sectoral Oversight Committees, Wickremesinghe expressed that despite prolonged discussions between the Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa and NPP Leader Anura Dissanayake regarding debate formats and venues, no agreement was reached. Regrettably, none of these individuals have put forth a viable economic agenda, the President highlighted. Meanwhile, Wickremesinghe emphasized that the upcoming presidential election will not be about his personal victory or defeat, but that of the countrys success or failure. The President noted that if the people are satisfied with the governments program, they can support it. Otherwise, they will face the consequences of living in a country with a collapsed economy, struggling to supply essential items like medicines and fertilizer, and experience long queues for fuel and gas. President Wickremesinghe made these remarks during a Dialogue on Policy Reforms held at the Waters Edge Hotel in Battaramulla yesterday (11), with Youth Representatives of the Parliamentary Sectoral Oversight Committees. The President highlighted that those making various promises on platforms today lack a concrete program to move the countrys economy forward. He also emphasized the need to avoid past mistakes by making decisions during elections, focusing on individuals. To advance the nations economy, the President urged all political parties to support the Economic Transformation Bill presented by the government. He also invited them to present any alternative proposals they might have for the country. President Ranil Wickremesinghe further stated, Today, you are gathered here as members of the Parliamentary Sectoral Oversight Committees. Since assuming the presidency, an idea was imparted to me during a discussion with Mr. Karu Jayasuriya, which has evolved into what we witness today. We have provided young leaders with a platform to contribute to governmental initiatives by offering their insights and recommendations for the nations future plans. Consequently, we carefully consider all viewpoints presented. There is prevalent discourse regarding the economic bankruptcy of our country today. However, I do not fully concur with this assessment. Our country is not only facing economic challenges but also political ones. These intertwined issues have become a formidable challenge that demands our attention. The absence of a formalized economic structure has left our country vulnerable to significant challenges. Historically, our economy has relied heavily on imports, creating a situation where our expenditure exceeded our financial resources. Compounded by the financial burdens of war, our fiscal situation deteriorated further. Despite hopes for rapid economic growth following the end of the war, progress has been limited. Fifteen years on from the end of the war, we find ourselves still grappling with economic stagnation. We persisted in employing outdated methods, resorting to borrowing when faced with financial constraints, ultimately leading to unsustainable debt levels. During this period, there was a reluctance to acknowledge the reality of our economic situation. However, we recognized the urgent need for economic reform and made commitments to that effect during electoral campaigns. Regrettably, amidst these efforts, certain elements within the country propagated unfounded fears of national sovereignty compromise. Despite such assertions, we find ourselves in a state of financial crisis. In 2015, during my tenure as Prime Minister, I had to implement tax increases to address the countrys revenue needs. However, in 2019, President Gotabaya Rajapaksa assumed leadership and initiated tax reductions, resulting in a decline in revenue. This reduction coincided with the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, exacerbating our financial challenges. Despite the pressing need for foreign exchange reserves amounting to US3 billion, this critical issue received little attention during the parliamentary elections. While our party, the United National Party, highlighted this concern in our policy statement, other parties focused on making unrealistic promises to voters. Consequently, our party suffered significant losses in the election, winning only one seat. It is unprecedented for a party with just one seat to appoint a Prime Minister or President. This situation underscores the political turmoil and lack of leadership in our country. Faced with this crisis, I assumed the presidency to address the economic challenges. Recognizing the importance of empowering the youth, we have initiated programs to foster their understanding and involvement in shaping the countrys economic future. It is imperative to equip the younger generation with the necessary skills and knowledge to lead our nation forward. Today, certain politicians are making extensive promises without presenting any concrete policies to drive the countrys economic growth. Despite prolonged discussions between the opposition leader and Mr. Anura Dissanayake regarding debate formats and venues, no agreement was reached. Regrettably, none of these individuals have put forth a viable economic agenda. In light of this, it is essential for them to articulate whether they offer alternative approaches beyond the governments initiatives. However, no such proposals have been forthcoming. If they are unwilling to engage constructively, it is imperative to consider alternative avenues for progress. Engaging in such programs facilitates valuable interactions with officials and the private sector, fostering knowledge enhancement and the generation of new ideas. I extend an invitation to all stakeholders to break free from conventional paradigms and propel the nation forward collectively. Below are the questions posed by the youth, along with President Ranil Wickremesinghes responses. Q: The draft bill aimed at transforming the National Youth Parliament from a mere concept into a constitutional institution has been presented. What are your thoughts on this development? A: The National Youth Parliament has been functioning for quite some time now, and its high time to formalize its status through legislation. One of the key challenges we face is determining the criteria for selecting its members. Should it be limited to certain youth organizations or open to all? If its open, how do we compile the participant lists? These are some of the critical questions that need resolution. Ive urged the concerned parties to come up with viable solutions, and well proceed accordingly. Furthermore, theres a pressing need to address the issue of female representation in provincial and divisional councils. The idea of youth representation was initially proposed during President Premadasas tenure, but it was confined to mere nominations. As part of our policy agenda, Im committed to implementing measures to enhance youth representation within the next two to three years. Its time to initiate discussions on this matter. Additionally, when it comes to Janasabha, we must consider the necessity and form of representation for women and youth. I believe its imperative to engage the youth in this dialogue and work towards finding suitable solutions. Q: Is there a possibility to establish a youth leadership task force to collaborate with ministry secretaries? There seems to be a lack of grassroots understanding in activities related to smart technology. What are your thoughts on this? A: Its indeed crucial to integrate youth perspectives into ministries and administrative processes. I encourage you to deliberate on how this integration can be effectively achieved and provide your recommendations. The significance of engaging with Parliament lies in its role in policy formulation, while involvement in ministries or provincial councils entails contributing to policy implementation. Together, lets explore the most suitable approach for connectivity and present your proposals. I refrain from dictating specifics because this pertains to your future, not mine. By 2048, I wont be in office, but you will. Q: When the countrys economy collapsed, you accepted the challenge and successfully faced it. But if you somehow lose the next election, will there be anyone to take the lead to continue the current program? A: The outcome of the upcoming election is not solely about my personal victory or defeat; it will determine whether the country succeeds or fails. Weve engaged in discussions with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and formulated an economic program, supported by the Economic Transformation Law. Should this program falter, we risk losing foreign exchange reserves, leading to shortages of essential items like medicines, fuel and gas. Hence, the decision to continue with the governments program is critical. I call upon all party leaders to support this economic transformation law or propose a viable alternative. This election isnt merely about selecting individuals but about choosing the most effective system for our countrys progress. If you believe in the merits of the current approach, let us proceed accordingly. Conversely, opting for a scenario where our economy collapses, devoid of essential resources, is another option. If the governments program lacks merit, an alternative must be presented. However, to date, no such alternative has been forthcoming. While some suggest renegotiating agreements with the IMF, the IMF has indicated their inflexibility. Can we afford to default on our national debts next month? Hence, it is imperative to consider the future of our nation carefully and make informed decisions accordingly. Senior Advisor to the President on National Security and Chief of Presidential Staff Sagala Ratnayaka, During both the war and the recent economic crisis, we all experienced significant hardships. The repercussions were far-reaching, plunging us into energy insecurity with prolonged power outages and fuel shortages. Misguided policies on food and fertilizers exacerbated food insecurity, leading to the collapse of the agricultural sector. This, coupled with challenges in healthcare and other vital sectors, inflicted severe economic hardships on us. As a nation, we found ourselves stripped of even the most basic necessities like food and gas. As such, national security encompasses more than just safeguarding territorial integrity. Recognizing this, a new role has been proposed for the President, complete with a National Security Advisor and a dedicated National Security Secretariat. While the bill outlining these changes has yet to be introduced, it will form part of a comprehensive legislation covering various critical areas, including the National Security Secretariat, the newly-established Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) Act, and the National Institute for Strategic Studies. The scope of the National Security Secretariat extends beyond traditional security to encompass economic and energy security, among other sectors. National security is a multifaceted concept that defies precise definition, spanning a wide array of fields. There is a pressing need for reform within our intelligence agencies, recognizing the distinct operational requirements during peacetime and wartime, both of which are integral to safeguarding the territorial integrity of the country. Efforts are underway to modernize these agencies with the assistance of our friendly nations. Additionally, we are incorporating an overseas division, formerly under the purview of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs but typically overseen by the Ministry of Defence. The event was attended by distinguished figures including Senior Advisor to the President on Economic Affairs Dr. R. H. S. Samaratunga, Parliamentary Deputy General Secretary Chaminda Kularatne, Presidents Counsel Eraj De Silva, and other officials.",

Apple has been consistently able to deliver products, services and messaging, which has closely resonated with the consumers, creating a strong fan-following for the brand, Counterpoint analyst Varun Mishra said. With a market capitalization of 3.18 trillion, Apple is ahead of AI chip powerhouse Nvidia at 2.97 trillion. Surfing a wave of AI enthusiasm and a boom in chip demand, Nvidia has for the first time entered Kantars list of top 10 most valuable brands in the world. Nvidia, led by the Godfather of AI Jensen (Huang) and the creator of this AI Revolution, is now a household brand as its GPU chips are the new gold and oil in the tech world, said Dan Ives, analyst at Wedbush Securities. Its brand value jumped to over 200 billion from a year earlier, making Nvidia the sixth most valuable brand, Kantar said. What really sets Nvidia apart is the faith that retail and institutional investors alike have in the firms centrality to the biggest disruptive narratives in tech, the consulting company said. Oracle , which offers AI-powered cloud services, also made its debut in Kantars top 10 at the ninth place. Its brand value jumped 58 to 145 billion. Kantar said its research covered over 4.3 million consumer interviews in 532 categories, and 21,000 different brands in 54 markets. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "date": "June 12, 2024 07:04 pm",
        "content": "The Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) announced that it functions as the regulatory and supervisory authority of Money or Value Transfer Service (MVTS) providers in Sri Lanka, effective from June 03, 2024. Currently, institutions providing money transfer services in Sri Lanka such as banks and nonbank financial institutions, are regulated by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) or other relevant authorities to ensure financial system stability. However, some entities providing similar services operate outside the formal system, potentially disrupting the money transfer system and not being subject to Anti-Money Laundering and Countering the Financing of Terrorism (AMLCFT) regulatory framework, the CBSL said in a statement. To address this, the Minister of Finance, Economic Stabilization, and National Policies issued the Money or Value Transfer Service (MVTS) Providers Regulations, No. 1 of 2024 dated April 20, 2024, under the provisions of the Payment and Settlement Systems Act, No. 28 of 2005, it added. Accordingly, effective from June 3, 2024, these regulations require all MVTS providers to be registered and be monitored, offering unregistered or unlicensed MVTS providers the opportunity to formalize their operations and engage in the money transfer business through formal channels. For the purpose of these Regulations, MVTS is defined as financial services that involve the acceptance of cash, cheques, other monetary instruments or other stores of value and the payment of a corresponding sum in cash or other forms to a beneficiary by means of communication, message, transfer, or through a clearing network to which the registered MVTS Provider belongs. Such transactions may involve one or more intermediaries and a final payment to a third party, and may be from place to place, within, to or from Sri Lanka or any other country, the statement mentioned. As per these Regulations, a person shall engage in the business of or function as an MVTS Provider only under the authority and in accordance with the terms and conditions of a Certificate of Registration issued by CBSL. However, any person who is already engaged in or is eligible to engage in the business of or function as an MVTS Provider under any other licence, permit or authorization issued by CBSL, or any other Regulator or Government entity is exempted from the aforementioned regulation. Further, existing MVTS Providers who are already providing services without any licence, permit or authorization issued by CBSL, or any other Regulator or Government entity shall apply for a Certificate of Registration from CBSL, within one year from the effective date of these Regulations, June 3, 2024, according to the CBSL.",

        "date": "June 12, 2024 09:43 pm",
        "content": "Sri Lanka will start talks on a free trade agreement with Malaysia, as it seeks to improve trade ties to support its recovery from a financial crisis, the Cabinet spokesperson said on Wednesday. A severe dollar drought in 2022 sent Sri Lankas inflation soaring to a high of 70, its currency into freefall and caused the economy to contract by 7.3. To help buttress recovery, Sri Lanka entered negotiations with multiple countries on free trade deals, inking one with Thailand in February. We need to promote stronger trade to move out of this crisis and Malaysia has strong ties with Sri Lanka to assist in this process, said Sri Lankas Cabinet spokesperson Bandula Gunawardana. He did not say when formal negotiations would begin. Trade between Malaysia and Sri Lanka was worth US934 million dollars in 2023, according to official data. Sri Lanka exports mainly gems, garments and fish to Malaysia, and imports palm oil, petroleum products and fertilisers. Indonesia and Sri Lanka aim to sign a preferential trade agreement next March. Colombo is also in talks with Bangladesh on a free trade agreement and has restarted talks to expand an existing agreement with India. The South Asian island nation is projected to post a 3 growth in 2024, after two years of contraction. Source - Reuters --Agencies",

        "date": "June 12, 2024 10:37 pm",
        "content": "Muslim pilgrims have been streaming into Saudi Arabias holy city of Mecca ahead of the start of the Hajj later this week, as the annual pilgrimage returns to its monumental scale. Saudi officials say more than 1.5 million foreign pilgrims have arrived in the country by Tuesday, the vast majority by air, from across the world. More are expected, and hundreds of thousands of Saudis and others living in Saudi Arabia will also join them when the pilgrimage officially begins on Friday. Saudi officials have said they expect the number of pilgrims this year to exceed 2023, when more than 1.8 million people performed Hajj, approaching pre-pandemic levels. In 2019, more than 2.4 million Muslims made the pilgrimage. Saudi authorities control the flow of pilgrims through quotas, allowing each country one pilgrim for every thousand Muslim citizens. The pilgrims included 4,200 Palestinians from the occupied West Bank who arrived in Mecca earlier this month, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Awqaf and Religious Affairs. Palestinians in the Gaza Strip were not able to travel to Saudi Arabia for Hajj this year, because of the 8-month war between Israel and Hamas. We are praying for Palestine to be free and (for Palestinians) to liberate their land and to be like other nations, to live in peace and not always to have war, said Ibrahim al-Hadhari, an Algerian pilgrim, as he was standing in the Grand Mosque court waiting for evening prayers. On Tuesday, pilgrims thronged the Grand Mosque in Mecca, performing a ritual circuit walking seven times around the Kaaba, the cube-shaped structure inside the mosque that is considered Islams holiest site. They wore ihrams, two unstitched sheets of white cloth that resemble a shroud. Source  The Associated Press --Agencies",

        "date": "June 12, 2024 11:40 pm",
        "content": "The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has approved Sri Lankas second review under the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) programme, paving the way for the country to receive the third tranche of around USD 330 million, Sri Lankas Foreign Minister Ali Sabry said. IMFs approved the 2nd review of Sri Lankas program. This achievement is a testament to our dedication to driving forward economic reforms and securing a prosperous future for all Sri Lankans, he posted on X (formerly Twitter). The Article IV Consultation and second review under the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) for Sri Lanka are on the International Monetary Funds (IMF) Executive Board meeting agenda for today (June 12), as confirmed by Julie Kozack, the Director of the IMF Communications Department. During a press briefing on Thursday (06), Kozack affirmed that there is a strong expectation that Sri Lanka will soon reach agreements with external commercial creditors consistent with program parameters. On March 21, IMF staff and the Sri Lankan authorities reached staff-level agreement on economic policies to conclude the second review of the economic reform program and also the 2024 Article IV Consultation. Meanwhile, Sri Lankas State Minister of Finance Shehan Semasinghe said today (June 12) marks a significant milestone for Sri Lankas economy as the International Monetary Funds executive board is scheduled to discuss the second review of the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) and Article IV consultation. In a post on X, Semasinghe expressed that the government remains optimistic that international partners will continue to support Sri Lankas efforts. He further highlighted that a favorable outcome from the review is expected to unlock the third tranche of approximately USD 330 million, which would further enhance confidence in our ongoing economic reforms and growth. Further, we are in the final steps of finalizing the debt restructuring agreements, with continued support from our bilateral partners, he added. The Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) has also expressed confidence that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) will approve the release of the third tranche under the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) programme today (12). Commenting regarding the matter, Assistant Governor of the CBSL Dr. Chandranath Amarasekara said: we hope IMF will announce releasing of the third tranche to Sri Lanka under the EFF programme this evening.

        "title": "IMF approves third tranche of Sri Lanka bailout after second review",
        "date": "June 13, 2024 05:53 am",
        "content": "The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) completed the second review under the 48-month Extended Fund Facility (EFF) Arrangement, allowing the authorities to draw SDR 254 million (about US336 million). This brings the total IMF financial support disbursed so far to SDR 762 million (about US1 billion). The Executive Board also concluded the 2024 Article IV Consultation with Sri Lanka, the Washington-based lender said in a statement. The EFF arrangement for Sri Lanka was approved by the Executive Board on March 20, 2023 in an amount of SDR 2.286 billion (395 percent of quota or about US3 billion). The first review of the EFF was completed by the Executive Board on December 12, 2023 with disbursements of SDR 254 million (about US337 million). The EFF-supported program aims to restore Sri Lankas macroeconomic stability and debt sustainability, mitigate the economic impact on the poor and vulnerable, rebuild external buffers, safeguard financial sector stability, and strengthen governance and growth potential. The IMF said signs of economic recovery are emerging as real GDP expanded by 3 percent (y-o-y) in the second half of 2023. May 2024 inflation was 0.9 percent and gross international reserves increased to US5.5 billion by end-April 2024. The primary balance improved to a surplus with tax revenue increasing to 9.8 percent of GDP in 2023. Despite improvements in nonperforming loans, pockets of vulnerabilities remain in the banking sector. The recovery remains gradual, and the medium-term growth potential hinges on appropriate policy settings. Growth is projected to recover moderately in 2024-25 given constrained bank credit and fiscal consolidation, while facing uncertainties around the debt restructuring and policy direction following the elections. Inflation is expected to temporarily increase due to one-off factors. The current account is expected to remain positive in 2024, driven by improved tourist arrivals and remittances. Domestic risks could arise from waning reform momentum, especially on revenue mobilization. External risks are associated with intensified regional conflicts, commodity price volatility, and a global slowdown. Slow progress in debt restructuring could widen financing gaps. Following the Executive Boards discussion, Mr. Kenji Okamura, Deputy Managing Director and Acting Chair, issued the following statement: Sri Lankas performance under its Fund-supported program remains strong. All quantitative targets were met, except for the marginal shortfall of indicative target on social spending. Most structural benchmarks were either met or implemented with delay. Reforms and policy adjustment are bearing fruit. The economy is starting to recover, inflation remains low, revenue collection is improving, and reserves continue to accumulate. Despite these positive developments, the economy is still vulnerable and the path to debt sustainability remains knife-edged. Important vulnerabilities associated with the ongoing debt restructuring, revenue mobilization, reserve accumulation, and banks ability to support the recovery continue to cloud the outlook. Strong reform efforts, adequate safeguards, and contingency planning help mitigate these risks. To restore fiscal sustainability, sustained revenue mobilization efforts, promptly finalizing the debt restructuring in line with program targets, and protecting social and capital spending remain critical. Advancing public financial management will help enhance fiscal discipline, and strengthening the debt management framework is also needed. Monetary policy should continue prioritizing price stability, supported by a sustained commitment to refrain from monetary financing and safeguard central bank independence. Continued exchange rate flexibility and gradually phasing out the balance of payments measures remain critical to rebuild external buffers and facilitate external rebalancing. Restoring bank capital adequacy and strengthening governance and oversight of state-owned banks are top priorities to revive credit growth and support economic recovery. The authorities need to press ahead with their efforts to address structural challenges to unlock long-term potential. Key priorities include steadfast implementation of the governance reforms; further trade liberalization to promote exports and foreign direct investment; labor reforms to upgrade skills and increase female labor force participation; and state-owned enterprise reforms to improve efficiency and fiscal transparency, contain fiscal risks, and promote a level playing field for the private sector. Executive Board Assessment Executive Directors commended the authorities strong performance under the Fundsupported program, noting that reforms are bearing fruit. The economy has started to recover, inflation remains low, revenue collection is improving, and reserves continue to accumulate. Directors underscored, however, that important vulnerabilities and uncertainties remain, including with respect to the ongoing debt restructuring and the upcoming elections. Against this backdrop, they called on the authorities to continue strengthening macroeconomic policies to restore economic stability and debt sustainability and to sustain the reform momentum to promote longterm inclusive growth. Directors underscored that restoring fiscal sustainability requires additional revenue measures underpinning the 2025 Budget, further tax administration reforms, as well as limiting tax exemptions and making them more transparent. They called for protecting growthenhancing and social spending, and for improving the social safety net. Directors welcomed the submission of the new Public Financial Management bill to Parliament, which would strengthen fiscal discipline and establish a solid fiscal framework. They noted that further efforts to strengthen the debt management framework are also needed. Directors welcomed the progress on achieving costrecovery in energy pricing, noting its criticality for containing risks from stateowned enterprises (SOEs). Directors welcomed the progress made to advance debt restructuring to restore Sri Lankas debt sustainability. They called for a swift finalization of the Memorandum of Understanding with the Official Creditor Committee and final agreements with the ExportImport Bank of China. Directors stressed the importance of seeking comparable, transparent, and timely completion of restructurings with external private creditors consistent with program targets. Directors emphasized that maintaining price stability remains the top priority for monetary policy, which requires anchoring inflation expectations, continuing to refrain from monetary financing, and the gradual unwinding of government security holdings as markets allow. They also stressed the importance of strengthening central bank independence. Directors underscored the need to continue building external buffers, while maintaining exchange rate flexibility to facilitate external rebalancing and preserve the credibility of the inflation targeting regime. They called for gradually phasing out the balance of payments measures. Directors underscored the need to strengthen financial sector resilience to support the recovery. They called for swift completion of the restructuring of remaining domestic law, foreign currency loans and for adequate recapitalization of commercial and stateowned banks. Directors welcomed the enactment of the Banking Act amendments and emphasized the importance of their effective implementation to enhance supervision and the governance of stateowned banks. They also called for further efforts to strengthen the antimoney laundering and counterterrorism financing framework. Directors stressed that pressing ahead with governance and structural reforms, supported by development partners and IMF capacity development, is crucial to unlock growth potential. They welcomed the publication of the authorities action plan on the key governance reforms recommended in the Governance Diagnostic Report and called for its steadfast implementation. Directors also recommended prioritizing reforms to further liberalize trade, improve the investment climate and SOE efficiency, reduce gender gaps in the labor market, and mitigate climate vulnerabilities.",

        "content": "The UN World Food Programme has welcomed Saudi Arabias donation of 300 tonnes of dates for vulnerable children in Sri Lanka. Provided through Saudi Arabias aid agency KSrelief, the dates will be given to primary grade children enrolled in the countrys national school meal program. The contribution was acknowledged at a signing event on Tuesday between the Embassy of Saudi Arabia in Sri Lanka and the WFP, according to a press release. Sri Lankas children have been severely affected by the countrys economic downturn which began in 2022, when lost jobs and reduced incomes made it harder for families to access nutritious meals. Through this contribution, Saudi Arabia joins international communities in supporting the nations recovery, particularly in improving nutrition and building its human capital. In times of crises, it is often children who are among those hardest hit, said Gerard Rebello, country director of WFP Sri Lanka. We are grateful for the support from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in diversifying the food children receive through the school meal program. The program is designed to fulfill up to one-third of a childs daily nutrients, making it a lifeline for many families. Substituting 20 percent of a households cost of a nutritious diet, the meals provide real value to poor communities, leaving them better able to afford healthy food. The nutrient-rich dates will be served as a complementary fruit at the end of a hot meal comprising rice and curry. Packed with vitamins, fiber and protein, the dates help meet the energy requirements of children, needed for them to learn and play. Source: Arab News --Agencies",
