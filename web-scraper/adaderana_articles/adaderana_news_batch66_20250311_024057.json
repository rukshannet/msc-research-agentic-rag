        "title": "Iceland declares state of emergency over volcanic eruption threat",
        "date": "November 11, 2023 09:41 am",
        "content": "Icelandic authorities have declared a state of emergency after a series of powerful earthquakes rocked the countrys southwestern Reykjanes peninsula, signalling the increased likelihood of a volcanic eruption in the region. The National police chief  declares a state of emergency for civil defence due to the intense earthquake (activity) at Sundhnjukagigar, north of Grindavik, the Department of Civil Protection and Emergency Management said in a statement. Earthquakes can become larger than those that have occurred and this series of events could lead to an eruption, the administration warned. The Icelandic Met Office (IMO) said an eruption could take place in several days. The village of Grindavik, home to about 4,000 people, is located 1.86 miles (3km) south-west of the area where Fridays earthquake swarm was registered. It has evacuation plans in place in case of an eruption. At about 5.30pm GMT, two strong earthquakes were felt as far as the capital, Reykjavik, 40km away, and along much of the countrys southern coast, causing windows and household objects to shake. The biggest tremor, north of Grindavik, had a magnitude of 5.2, according to preliminary IMO figures. Police closed a road running north-south to Grindavik on Friday after it was damaged by the earthquakes. Since late October, 24,000 tremors have been registered on the peninsula, according to the IMO, with a dense swarm of nearly 800 quakes registered between midnight and 2pm GMT on Friday. The IMO noted an accumulation of magma underground at a depth of about 3.1 miles (5km). Should it start moving towards the surface it could lead to a volcanic eruption. The most likely scenario is that it will take several days rather than hours for magma to reach the surface, it said. If a fissure were to appear where the seismic activity is at its highest now, lava would flow to the south-east and to the west, but not towards Grindavik. Since 2021, three eruptions have taken place on the Reykjanes peninsula, in March 2021, August 2022 and July 2023. Those three were located far from any infrastructure or populated areas. On Thursday, the Blue Lagoon, located near Grindavik and famed for its geothermal spas and luxury hotels, closed as a precaution after another earthquake swarm. Also nearby is the Svartsengi geothermal plant, the main supplier of electricity and water to 30,000 residents on the Reykjanes peninsula. It has contingency plans in place to protect the plant and its workers in the event of an eruption. Iceland has 33 active volcanic systems, the highest number in Europe.

        "date": "November 11, 2023 03:32 pm",
        "content": "Sports Minister Roshan Ranasinghe has questioned the recent ban imposed by the International Cricket Council (ICC) against Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC), and assured that Sri Lanka would appeal to the global cricket governing body in this regard. Speaking at a special press conference held this afternoon (10 Nov.) at the Sports Ministry in Colombo, Ranasinghe stated that the ban comes as a shock, given its sudden implementation by the ICC. The Minister explained that the ban was imposed without any prior notice or warning, and is thereby inconsistent with the required ICC procedures usually followed in such matters. It is not ethical, it is a surprise, Ranasinghe said, explaining that as per the ICCs arbitration rules, prior to suspending a countrys membership from the ICC, the global cricket body is required to notify the relevant member country of their shortcomings at an Annual General Meeting (AGM), following which the relevant countrys membership may be suspended one year from the date of initial notice, in the event the concerns they were notified of remain unaddressed. How can they condemn our country like this? They condemned our country without informing us, the Minister asserted, explaining that Sri Lanka is not the only ICC member with interim committees and alleged state influence in cricket. Speaking further in this regard, Ranasinghe raised questions about countries such as Pakistan and Afghanistan; the former where there exists a plethora of interim committees related to cricket, and the latter where, albeit ICC law stating that there be a womens cricket team, the Taliban law does not allow for such an establishment.That is also state involvement, the Minister said, questioning the rationale behind Sri Lankas ban. Thus, the Minister explained that measures are currently underway to first question the ICC on the grounds and shortcomings on which Sri Lankas membership was banned. However, if these measures fail, the Minister asserted that Sri Lanka would appeal to the ICC in this regard. On Friday night (10 Nov.), the ICC suspended SLCs membership, with immediate effect, saying that the national cricket governing body is in serious breach of its obligations as a Member, in particular, the requirement to manage its affairs autonomously and ensure that there is no government interference.",

        "title": "Indian scientists hope cloud seeding can clean Delhis toxic air",
        "date": "November 11, 2023 04:41 pm",
        "content": "Indian scientists plan to seed clouds for the first time to trigger heavy rain in some areas of New Delhi, hoping this will be enough to tackle the smog gripping the worlds most polluted capital for a week, the projects head said on Thursday. Air quality dips in Delhi ahead of winter every year, when cold air traps pollutants from a variety of sources including vehicles, industries, construction dust, and agricultural waste burning. Scientists expect some cloud cover over the city around Nov. 20 and are hoping this will be large enough - and with high enough moisture content - to trigger heavy rain via seeding with salts, said Manindra Agrawal, a scientist at the Indian Institute of Technology at Kanpur, who is leading the trial. The project, estimated to cost 10 million rupees (120,000) for 100 square kilometres (38.6 square miles), would involve spraying into clouds a mix of salts that include silver iodine, Agrawal said. We dont expect that big a cloud that will cover entire Delhi, but a few hundred kilometres would be good, he told Reuters. The local government of the city of 20 million people, spread over roughly 1,500 square kilometres (579 square miles), has already shut all schools, stopped construction activities, and said it will impose restrictions on vehicle use to control pollution. The air quality index in the city was 506 early on Thursday, which is categorised as hazardous by Swiss group IQAir. Delhi needs heavy and widespread rain to wash away the pollutants, and light rain could worsen the situation, said Gufran Beig, the founder director of the federal governments air-quality monitoring agency SAFAR. Beig added that current airflow is carrying smoke from crop residue burning in the states of Punjab and Haryana to Delhi, which also has its own pollution sources and where there is currently almost no wind. So unless a huge pressure is established by intense rain, this chain of transport from Punjab to Delhi will not be broken, and once it is broken it is difficult for the chain to form again for some time, he told Reuters. About 38 of the pollution in the capital has been caused by stubble burning in Punjab and Haryana, where over 22,000 stubble burning events were recorded between Sept.15 and Nov. 7, according to a government statement. Stubble burning is a practice followed by farmers wherein crop stubble left behind after rice is harvested is burnt to quickly clear fields before planting wheat crops. The federal government has directed authorities in both states to take effective actions to check further stubble burning, the statement added. The Delhi government is seeking to get approval for the project from the Supreme Court, which is hearing petitions related to pollution. Several countries have used cloud seeding to produce rain, improve air quality and water crops in time of drought, including Mexico, the United States, China, Indonesia and Malaysia. However, in 2021, a plan to seed clouds over the mountains of New Mexico to increase snowfall was pulled after allegations it could poison people and the environment. Source: Reuters -Agencies",

        "date": "November 11, 2023 06:20 pm",
        "content": "Taylor Swift has broken a Grammys record with her latest nomination for song of the year. The shortlisting of her hit Anti-Hero makes Swift the first songwriter to score seven nominations in the category - overtaking Sir Paul McCartney and Lionel Richie, who have six each. She is also nominated in the album and record of the year categories alongside Olivia Rodrigo, Miley Cyrus and SZA. Lana Del Rey and Dua Lipa are among the other nominees for song of the year. Billie Eilish, Jon Batiste and SZA have also been recognised in the category. Swifts album of the year nod for Midnights is her sixth nomination in this category - and ties her with Barbra Streisand for the most nominations for a female artist. If she wins, she will become the first artist to win album of the year four times. It was harder for artists to make the Grammys shortlist this year due to new rules. Organisers have cut the number of nominations available in each category from 10 to eight. British dance and electronic producer Fred Again is among the nominees for best new artist. He is joined in the category by Gracie Abrams, Ice Spice, Jelly Roll, Coco Jones, Noah Kahan, Victoria Monet and War and Treaty. US rapper and singer Jelly Roll might have been around since 2005 - but he scored a breakout single earlier this year with Need A Favor. If the 38-year-old wins the award he will become the oldest person to be named best new artist - Sheryl Crow currently holds the record after picking it up aged 33. Cyrus, Rodrigo, Swift, SZA, Batiste, Boygenius, Eilish and Monet are recognised on the record of the year shortlist. Song of the year is different to record of the year - the former recognises songwriters and achievement in composition while the latter is concerned with the technical recording process - taking into account production, engineering and performance. Many of the same artists are nominated for album of the year, with Swift, SZA, Rodrigo, Batiste, Boygenius and Cyrus all recognised alongside Janelle Monae and Lana Del Rey. SZA and supergroups Nominations were announced on Friday, with singer-songwriter SZA leading the pack with nine in total. She was recognised in the best progressive RB album and best RB performance categories. SZAs collaboration with Phoebe Bridgers with Ghost in the Machine was nominated for best pop duogroup performance. Bridgers indie supergroup Boygenius was recognised in six categories too - including record of the year for Not Strong Enough and album of the year for The Record. Boygenius, made up of Julien Baker, Lucy Dacus and Bridgers, first got together to debut a self-titled EP in 2018 and returned with new music earlier this year. Monet has also had a strong showing - along with best new artist and record of the year for On My Mama she is also nominated for best RB album for Jaguar II and best RB performance for Hollywood. Batiste was a surprise winner at last years ceremony and features in the major categories once again, with his album World Music Radio and song Worship up for the top prizes. Pop power Cyrus nomination for Flowers in the song and record of the year categories and Endless Summer Vacations album of the year nomination mark her first appearance in one of the major categories. She previously had only received one nomination, for best pop album in 2015 for Bangerz. Lana Del Rey has never won a Grammy before - but is recognised in five categories this year, including best alternative music album and best alternative music performance. Rodrigo joins Eilish in achieving the feat of being nominated for best album, song and record for her first two studio albums. The 20-year-old former Disney stars received chart success this year with song Vampire and album Guts. Eilish has also featured heavily in this years Grammy nominations - the song she made for the Barbie movie, What Was I Made For?, has made it onto the song and record of the year list. The music from Barbie is well-represented across the nominations receiving 12 nods. Dua Lipas Dance the Night, which is up for song of the year, features on the films soundtrack. Meanwhile Barbie World by Nicki Minaj and Ice Spice, and Ryan Goslings Im Just Ken, are up for best song written for visual media. Notable snubs Country star Morgan Wallen only received one nod in the best country song category but didnt break through into any of the major ones. His single Last Night topped the US charts for 16 weeks, with the track achieving the feat of the first country song by a male solo artist to reach number one in 42 years. Wallen, who was criticised over the use of a racial slur in 2022, also had chart success with his album One Thing At A Time earlier this year. Doja Cat also didnt make it into any of the big categories - receiving nods for her song Attention in the best melodic rap performance and best rap song lists. Paint the Town Red, which samples Dionne Warwicks Walk On By, was expected to make it onto the record of the year list but only managed the best pop performance category. Earlier this year, Beyoncé became the most decorated artist in Grammys history, winning four awards at the 65th ceremony - bringing her total haul to 32. Source - BBC - Agencies",

        "date": "November 11, 2023 06:52 pm",
        "content": "President of Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) Shammi Silva has warned that in the event the International Cricket Council (ICC) does not lift the ongoing suspension against the countrys membership, the country stands to lose 50 millions of US Dollars. Speaking at a press conference held this afternoon (11 Nov.), Silva explained that it was after several discussions and deliberations that the ICC allowed the island nation to host both the U19 Cricket World Cup and the Annual General Meeting (AGM) of the ICC in 2024, and the Womens World Cup later in 2027. He further revealed that measures were also underway to co-host the T20 World Cup in 2026 together with India. The SLC President explained that in order for these tournaments, along with the AGM, to take place as scheduled, ICC required a certain level of assurance that the government of Sri Lanka would support these endeavours. They dont have that confidence anymore. The AGM has already been cancelled, and I dont know what will happen to the U19 World Cup, Shammi Silva said, explaining that an ICC official who was on the island to discuss matters in this regard, had left this morning. Thereby, he warned that Sri Lanka is on the verge of losing USD 50 million, in the event the ICC suspension continues. Speaking further on the suspension imposed by the ICC on Sri Lanka with immediate effect on Friday (10 Nov.), Shammi Silva, together with the other SLC officials present at todays briefing, revealed that the suspension, despite Sports Minister Roshan Ranasinghes claims, was not, in fact, a shock. Silva noted that the ICC initially notified SLC of a possible suspension in July this year, following ICC Deputy Chairman Imran Khwajas visit in May, subsequent to which discussions were held between the relevant parties, and the matter had been resolved to a certain extent. But how are we supposed to work with people like this?, the SLC President said in reference to Minister Ranasinghe, adding that there was a high level of unnecessary interference, politicization and corruption. Silva alleged that Sports Minister Roshan Ranasinghe was the reason behind the drastic downfall of not only cricket , but of sports as a whole in Sri Lanka, alleging that one man is destroying everything. He highlighted that the during Ranasinghes tenure, Sri Lanka has been banned in the international arena for football, rugby and cricket. Nothing can be done. We cannot develop sports with a minister like this, his powers need to be curtailed, Silva asserted, urging that President Ranil Wickremesinghe should intervene in the ordeal. SLC found itself under fire after several back and forth allegations concerning fund transfers and other nefarious activities, following which the ICC, on Friday night, suspended Sri Lankas membership, with immediate effect, on account of the cricket governing body having been in serious breach of its obligations as a Member, in particular, the requirement to manage its affairs autonomously and ensure that there is no government interference.",

        "date": "November 11, 2023 08:08 pm",
        "content": "Israel must stop killing babies and women in Gaza, French President Emmanuel Macron has told the BBC. In an exclusive interview at the Élysée Palace, he said there was no justification for the bombing, saying a ceasefire would benefit Israel. While recognising Israels right to protect itself, we do urge them to stop this bombing in Gaza, he said. But he also stressed that France clearly condemns the terrorist actions of Hamas. France - like Israel, the US, the UK, and other Western nations - considers Hamas a terrorist organisation. When asked if he wanted other leaders - including in the US and the UK - to join his calls for a ceasefire, he replied: I hope they will. After a month of Israeli bombardment and nearly two weeks after Israel launched a major ground offensive into the territory, Gazas Hamas-run health ministry said on Friday that 11,078 people had been killed, while 1.5 million had fled their homes. Israel says it attacks military targets in line with international law and takes steps to reduce civilian casualties, like issuing warnings ahead of strikes and calling on people to evacuate. Speaking the day after a humanitarian aid conference in Paris about the war in Gaza, Mr Macron said the clear conclusion of all governments and agencies present at that summit was that there is no other solution than first a humanitarian pause, going to a ceasefire, which will allow us to protect... all civilians having nothing to do with terrorists. De facto - today, civilians are bombed - de facto. These babies, these ladies, these old people are bombed and killed. So there is no reason for that and no legitimacy. So we do urge Israel to stop. He said it was not his role to judge whether international law had been broken. We share Israels pain Israels Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu responded quickly to Mr Macrons comments, saying nations should condemn Hamas, not Israel. The crimes that Hamas is committing today in Gaza will be committed tomorrow in Paris, New York and anywhere in the world, a statement from Mr Netanyahus office read. In a wide-ranging interview at the end of the first day of an annual Paris Peace Forum, President Macron also discussed:  Fears of violence spilling over from the Middle East into France, urging citizens of all faiths to be united against antisemitism  Russias invasion of Ukraine, saying it was Frances duty to help Ukraine - but suggesting there may come a time for fair and good negotiations with Moscow  Extremism online, saying Facebooks parent company Meta and Google just dont deliver on moderation  And the dangers of climate change, saying it was pushing people around the world toward terrorism. Starting by discussing Gaza, Mr Macron said France clearly condemns Hamass attacks on Israel on 7 October which sparked the war. Hamas gunmen killed about 1,200 people and took 240 others hostage in its unprecedented cross-border assault it launched that day. We do share Israels pain. And we do share their willingness to get rid of terrorism. We know what terrorism means in France. But he said there was no justification for the ongoing bombing of civilians in Gaza. Its extremely important for all of us because of our principles, because we are democracies. Its important for the mid-to-long run as well for the security of Israel itself, to recognise that all lives matter. When asked, he refused to say that Israel had broken international law in Gaza. Im not a judge. Im a head of state, he said, adding it would not be right to criticise Israel in this way - a partner and a friend - just a month after it was attacked. But Mr Macron said he disagreed that the best way for Israel to protect itself is having a large bombing of Gaza, saying it was creating resentment and bad feelings in the region that would prolong the conflict. Israel has said it will start daily four-hour military pauses in parts of northern Gaza as it continues its offensive. Its defence minister however stressed the pauses would be localised and would not detract from the war fighting. Condemn antisemitism without ambiguity Ahead of a march against antisemitism on Sunday which a large section of Frances political class will attend, President Macron called on all French citizens to condemn antisemitic acts without ambiguity. He said France had probably Europes biggest Muslim community and a big Jewish community too, and with France and the rest of Europe seeing a big rise in antisemitism, all French citizens had to be united against antisemitism, and had to share the pain or the compassion of Palestinians. Mr Macron then moved on to other global issues, including Russias full-scale invasion of Ukraine. He said if Russia were allowed to win its war, you will have a new imperial power in Europe, that could threaten other former Soviet states like Georgia and Kazakhstan, as well as the whole continent. Because, definitely, its imperialism and colonialism that Russia is doing in Ukraine, he said. The French president said it was the duty of his country and all countries to support Ukraine in its defence. But he also said the next month would be critical, as it struggles to retake lost land in counteroffensive operations. He said it was not yet time for Ukraine to come to the table, and stressed the decision to negotiate was Kyivs alone. But he added there may come a time to have fair and good negotiations, and to come back to the table and find a solution with Russia. Mr Macron also discussed online extremism - a key topic at the Paris Peace Forum. He singled out Facebooks parent company Meta and Google, saying the companies simply dont deliver on promises they made to moderate hate speech on their platforms. He said many online platforms lacked sufficient moderators for French language content, calling it a shame, and promising to push them on the issue - although he said TikTok had improved the number of moderators for its French language content. And he said that climate change was causing terrorism in parts of the world, specifically mentioning the effects of global warming in lower water levels at Lake Chad in West Africa. As a consequence of climate change, a lot of families living as fishermen suffered... A lot of species just disappeared. And it created politics that pushed a lot of people to terrorism. But when asked if he ever felt depressed by the sheer number of issues facing the world, Mr Macron said he saw it as a chance and an honour to have responsibilities as head of state. We need international cooperation to tackle global issues... This is a unique chance. Source - BBC - Agencies",

        "content": "Recognizing the significance of Artificial Intelligence (AI), the Government of Sri Lanka has appointed a committee to drive the development of Sri Lankas AI strategy, anchored under the Presidential Secretariat. The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) Sri Lanka, as a member of the aforementioned committee, launched the AI Readiness Assessment (AIRA), a key milestone in the process of shaping Sri Lankas AI strategy. The AIRA is a tool developed by UNDP that aims to assess the current AI landscape in Sri Lanka and provide input to the overall AI strategy that will be developed next year. AIRA is composed of a comprehensive survey that gauges the insights of the public sector, plus a series of Key Informant Interviews that capture the perspectives of those within the non-governmental sectors, including academic, development partners, and private sector amongst others. To launch the assessment and to carry out the Key Informant Interviews a mission from UNDPs Chief Digital Office (CDO) was carried out during the 3rd week of October 2023. During this mission, experts from UNDPs CDO conducted interviews with key stakeholders to understand the AI and digital transformation landscape of Sri Lanka. A workshop participated by more than 80 public sector officials representing numerous ministries and departments was also organized and facilitated by UNDP to launch the survey component of the AIRA. Hon. Kanaka Herath, State Minister of Technology highlighted that, We have already established the AI committee to formulate the National AI Strategy. AIRA will help us assess where we are as a country today to secure the benefits of AI and support the formulation of the foundation for strategy. Towards the end of this assessment, we should have data points on the AI Policy and Strategy based on key priorities such as focus areas, and foundational building blocks including data, infrastructure, and skills.",

        "date": "November 12, 2023 12:22 pm",
        "content": "The Sri Lanka cricket team apologised to the cricket-loving public of the country, following the teams disappointing showing at the ongoing 2023 ICC Cricket World Cup held in India. Sri Lanka captain Kusal Mendis issued the apology on behalf of the squad, during a press conference held at Sri Lanka Crickets head office today (12). Furthermore, Captain Kusal Mendis asserted that the Sri Lanka team was not under any threats or external pressures to underperform during the 2023 World Cup tournament. Meanwhile, in response to a question raised by a journalist about whether any pressure of holding the captaincy affected his poor performance, Mendis expressed that although the unexpected captaincy may have had a minor impact on his performance, it is not at all the reason since he has prior experience of captaining. We were looking at how we could get selected to the final four. I was with that pressure. Captaincy is not a big pressure for me. Mendis appealed Sunday for the governing International Cricket Council to lift its suspension of the country over alleged political interference in the local board. This is our profession and we cant be staying at home doing nothing, Mendis told reporters in the capital Colombo. We want to start practising as there are a few tours to happen next year. The ICC said on Friday that Sri Lanka Cricket was in serious breach of its obligations as a member, highlighting the requirement to manage its affairs autonomously and to ensure that there is no government interference. The suspension came a day after Sri Lankas parliament asked the board to resign over allegations by sports minister Roshan Ranasinghe that it had syphoned off millions of dollars. As players we had no control over that, Mendis said. As the captain I only hope for its (the bans) removal so that we can resume our game. It was not immediately clear if the indefinite suspension would affect Sri Lanka hosting the Under-19 World Cup in January. Team manager Mahinda Halangoda said Sri Lankas players had been told to try and carry on as normal. The team management had a discussion with the players and asked them to focus on cricket, he said. In the meantime, Consultant Coach of the Sri Lanka cricket team, former captain Mahela Jayawardene stated that they hope the suspension imposed by the International Cricket Council (ICC) on Sri Lanka Cricket will be lifted soon so that the team will be allowed to play. Also, he expressed that the issues of the cricket administration or other people are neither relevant to us nor these players. We can only control the uplifting of players skills and correcting down the mistakes through these experiences. Moreover, Jayawardene asserted that the selection committee had selected the best team from the available players, but they failed to perform at the World Cup tournament. Sri Lankas inconsistency cost them dear at the World Cup as the team suffered seven defeats in nine matches at the 50-overs tournament in India. Sri Lanka, who had already been eliminated, lost by five wickets to New Zealand at Bengalurus M. Chinnaswamy Stadium on Thursday while the country also failed to qualify for the ICC Champions Trophy 2025. --With Agencies Inputs",

        "date": "November 12, 2023 02:44 pm",
        "content": "Alibaba Group reported that its Chinese e-commerce platforms Tmall and Taobao recorded positive year-on-year growth over this years Singles Day sales period, which wrapped up at midnight on Saturday. Meanwhile competitor JD.com said its festival GMV (gross merchandising volume) hit a record high over the sales period. Originally a 24-hour online shopping event held on Nov. 11 each year in China, the Singles Day festival - a nod to the digits in the date - has expanded into weeks of promotions across the countrys major e-commerce platforms and in brick-and-mortar stores. This year marked the second time Alibaba has not disclosed the actual yuan value of its sales for its landmark festival, which this year celebrated its 15th anniversary. Last year, when sales were hit by continuing COVID curbs across China, was the first. The festival is closely watched as a gauge of consumer confidence, and expectations for sales growth this year have been subdued, as the economy has been flirting with deflation while making an unsteady recovery. E-commerce giant Alibaba, Chinas largest e-commerce player by market share, had put pressure on merchants to offer rock-bottom prices this Singles Day, announcing at the outset of the festival in late October that it would offer 80 million products at their lowest prices this year for the blockbuster event. That move was seen as a way to fight back against rivals such as Douyin and PDD Holdings Pinduoduo which have changed the landscape of Chinese e-commerce in recent years by selling lower-cost and discounted items year-round. Steep discounts of 40-50 were much more common than in previous years as a result. A Bain and Company report released last week found that 77 of the 3,000 consumers it surveyed had planned to spend less or the same on Singles Day compared with last year. Bain saw shoppers spending on necessities such as tissues, handwash, instant noodles and pet food, while at the same time trading down and buying less in discretionary or big-ticket categories such as home appliances and furniture. Last year, the total value of goods sold during the shopping bonanza totaled 1.15 trillion yuan (157.97 billion), according to Bain. Though several consultancies were predicting Singles Day GMV growth across platforms would reach anywhere from 14 to 18 - returning to double-digit growth for the first time since the pandemic - the final sales picture will take longer to energe. These GMV figures take into account the value of all orders placed, and will not capture the amount that will be returned later. Analysts and industry executives expect return rates to be high this year as consumers buy more in order to obtain larger discounts on checkout, only to return the items they dont need. Items related to health and wellness and outdoor lifestyles were expected to outperform, with global brands such as Nike and Lululemon expected to sell well. Alibaba reported that sales of road bikes jumped 300 during the first hour of sales. Colour cosmetics, traditionally a strong performer throughout the Singles Day sales period, were expected to struggle this year as make-up demand remains low almost a year after China lifted strict COVID-19 restrictions.

According to police sources, Y Jeyarasa (41), of Jaffna in Sri Lanka, was caught at Kampipadu seashore and brought to the Mandapam police station for interrogation. A preliminary inquiry revealed that he was helped by two Lankan nationals. Jeyarasa worked as a labourer in Jaffna and allegedly was associated with the LTTE till the end of the civil war in 2009. He was surrendered to the Sri Lankan army after the war concluded and was lodged in Poonthotham prison, Vavuniya, for eight years from 2016, the police said. They added that Jeyarasa is married to Raji of Navanthanai, and has four children. He separated from his family in 2019 and lived with his mother. The authorities further said that Jeyarasa has criminal cases registered in Sahavachery and Oorkavalthurai police stations in Sri Lanka. He decided to flee in order to evade the arrest, and approached one Rokshan, of Pechalai, Sri Lanka, on November 9, to help him arrange for a boat to India. Rokshan demanded 2,00,000 (SLR). On November 10, he took the money and Jeyarasa set sail on a boat from Pechalai at 4 pm. On November 11, Jeyarasa landed at Kampipadu seashore at 7 am and was brought to Mandapam PS for interrogation.

        "date": "November 12, 2023 04:00 pm",
        "content": "Icelandic authorities said on Saturday they were preparing for a volcanic eruption in the south-west of the island in the coming days after a series of earthquakes and evidence of magma spreading rapidly underground. The Icelandic Meteorological Office said there was a considerable risk of an eruption on or just off the Reykjanes peninsula because of the size of the underground magma intrusion and the rate at which it was moving. The probability of an eruption has increased since this morning and an eruption could start at any time in the next few days, it said in a statement. Icelands Civil Protection Agency overnight ordered a complete evacuation of Grindavik, a fishing town of around 3,000 residents. The Reykjanes region has seen several eruptions in unpopulated areas in recent years. The latest is expected to begin on the seabed just south-west of Grindavik, the meteorological office said. A tunnel of magma, or molten rock, that extends north-east across Grindavik and some 10km further inland, was estimated late on Saturday at a depth of less than 800 metres, compared with 1,500m earlier in the day, the office said. On Thursday, increased seismic activity prompted the closure of the Blue Lagoon geothermal spa, one of Icelands main tourist attractions. Reykjanes is a volcanic and seismic hot spot south-west of the capital Reykjavik. In March 2021, lava fountains erupted spectacularly from a fissure in the ground measuring between 500 to 750 metres long in the regions Fagradalsfjall volcanic system. Volcanic activity in the area continued for six months that year, prompting thousands of Icelanders and tourists to visit the scene. In August 2022, a three-week eruption happened in the same area, followed by another in July of this year. The Fagradalsfjall system, which is around 6km wide and 19km long, had remained inactive for more than 6,000 years prior to the recent eruptions. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "title": "President to introduce budget proposals for implementing DIGIECON economic concept",
        "date": "November 12, 2023 05:35 pm",
        "content": "The Information and Communication Technology Agency of Sri Lanka has announced that President Ranil Wickremesinghe will present proposals to implement the Digi-Econ (DIGIECON) economic concept, the Presidents Media Division reported. This initiative aims to achieve a revenue of US 15 billion through digital economies by 2030, according to Sachindra Samararatne, Deputy Chief Digital Economic Officer of the Information and Communication Technology Agency of Sri Lanka (ICTA). In a noteworthy development, the Prime Minister has instructed the Ministry of Technology to spearhead the establishment of the digital economy through extensive public and private partnerships, marking a significant first for Sri Lanka. Samararatne highlighted that the Minister of State for Technology, Kanaka Herath, has successfully engaged in discussions with various stakeholders and the resulting plan has been submitted to President Ranil Wickremesinghe, the Presidents Media Division (PMD) said in a statement. These details were shared by Sachindra Samararatne during his participation in the 101 Katha program produced by the Presidents Media Division. Expressing his views further Mr Samararatne said; When discussing the possibilities with computers, E Sri Lanka was deliberated. By 2015, the emphasis shifted from e, and the digital era took centre stage, particularly with the advent of smartphones. Today, activities like buying and selling have undergone digitization, a transformative change facilitated by the internet. In line with the Presidents guidance, Digi-Econ introduced an economic concept in 2015, aiming for success by 2030. The dynamic nature of the digital landscape necessitates continuous adaptation. The inaugural step toward constructing a digital economy, fostering collaboration between the public and private sectors, has been taken. The potential for digitization to contribute up to 20 to the existing economys growth is substantial, promising significant economic improvement. Numerous individuals in Sri Lanka have played a role in shaping the digital economy policy. Implemented in partnership with the public and private sectors, as well as the World Bank, details about this initiative are available on the Ministry of Technologys website. The digital economy has significantly empowered the new generation, becoming an integral part of everyones economic participation. The sustainability of this policy is evident due to strong government support, attracting substantial investments. International investors consider a countrys level of digitization when making investment decisions. Providing governmental backing for the advancement of the digital economy is crucial and establishing an institution for this purpose would be beneficial. The inception of Digi-Econ was inspired by the Presidents vision, advocating for collaborative efforts between the public and private sectors. The President is actively working to elevate the countrys economy by synergizing these sectors. Transforming the public mindset can accelerate economic development significantly, as evidenced by the economic progress of countries like Singapore and Malaysia. Studying their economic advancements is crucial, and we should establish an institution tailored to our model. Many nations have propelled their digital economies through budgetary allocations. To foster the export sector, investing in the digital economy is imperative. Over the past decade, our IT organization has collaborated with the World Bank, leading to rapid growth in Sri Lankas information technology industry. Specific strategies are necessary and an institutional framework with budgetary support is crucial to implementing the digital economy policy. Sponsorship empowers both the government and private sectors, positioning Sri Lankas economy for strength and growth. Currently, 4.3 of GDP is allocated to the digital economy. Increasing this to 20 can robustly propel the digital economy forward. The impact of digitization on public services and individual lives is apparent. President Ranil Wickremesinghe aims to present proposals for the Digi-Econ (DIGIECON) economic concept through this years budget, striving for a 15 billion income for Sri Lanka from digital economies by 2030. The Information Technology Agency has laid the groundwork for a digital country. Building upon this foundation, envisioning a fully digitized nation is plausible. Our institutions have directed efforts to the Australian market from 2011 to 2018 and now its essential to establish a digital economic order to surpass the existing foundation. Strengthening the legal framework is vital. Our institution has tailored a model based on Australias digital transformation, providing leadership training upon its introduction to Sri Lanka. Technical support is offered and the government is poised to provide necessary assistance. This unique opportunity demands that Sri Lanka fortify its digital economy to enhance productivity at individual and organizational levels. The qualitative impact of such productivity can swiftly advance the countrys overall economic development.",

He said that this years budget has been prepared by facing the challenge of finding solutions for the entire population who are under pressure, the challenge of making the country ride up again in the long term as well as the challenge of finding expenses for that purpose. However, more attention has been paid to the poor people who need relief, while preparing the budget, he said further.

        "date": "November 12, 2023 08:43 pm",
        "content": "World Cup-winning former Sri Lanka captain Arjuna Ranatunga, expressing his views regarding the suspension imposed by the International Cricket Council (ICC) on Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC), has called for a comprehensive investigation into the matter. Ranathunga further highlighted that President Ranil Wickremesinghe has to stand by his commitments against corruption and launch a separate investigation into the matter, in his official capacity, with the intention of punishing those who are responsible for betraying Sri Lanka. We should investigate how we ended up here, and expose everyone responsible for leading us here. If there is a system which allows someone to betray the entire country for self-protection, the President should take tough decisions by conducting proper investigations, he stressed. This is the best time to clean this up, said Ranatunga, who is the Chairman of the SLC Interim Committee which was later suspended through a court order. I urge the President to conduct a thorough investigation into the pressure exerted on the Minister of Sports to change his decision. Meanwhile, he stated that the Presidents priority must be to inquire into who laid the foundation for the suspension of SLCs membership, what statements were made abroad betraying the country, in doing so who tried to destroy Sri Lanka Cricket and what punishments should be given to those people. However, we must try to get this ban lifted as soon as possible. I am unhappy about the procedure too, he added. Ranatunga, who expressed that this investigation must be handed over to the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) and other respective authorities, also said that nevertheless, it is more important that the President conducts an investigation to uncover the individuals responsible for destroying Sri Lanka Cricket and to punish them. Commenting further regarding the matter, the former Sri Lanka captain highlighted that even the ruling party and the opposition in the Parliament got together in order to halt the corruption in Sri Lanka Cricket. Moreover, he said: During the war time in this country, even fighting was stopped for a day because we were playing for the country in 1996. It was neither Arjuna Ranatungas team nor Ranatungas cricket administration. When the Sri Lankan cricket team was playing, even the LTTE stopped the war and watched the cricket match, he claimed.",

        "date": "November 12, 2023 10:40 pm",
        "content": "Heavy fighting between Israeli forces and Hamas trapped thousands of people in Gazas hospitals on Sunday, as medics and aid workers warned patients will die in the crippled facilities unless there is a pause in the battle. Bright flares lit up the night sky over Gaza City and blasts echoed across the city as Israels air and ground campaign to destroy Hamas brought the fight to key medical installations. If we do not stop this bloodshed immediately with a ceasefire or at the bare minimum a medical evacuation of patients, these hospitals will become a morgue, medical aid group Doctors Without Borders warned early Sunday. Al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City, the biggest in the territory, is totally surrounded and bombardments are going on nearby, the hospitals director, Mohammad Abu Salmiya, said in a statement late on Saturday. The medical team cannot work and the bodies, in their dozens, cannot be managed or buried, he said. Inside the hospital, Doctors Without Borders surgeon Mohammed Obeid said there was no water, power, food or internet for about 600 post-operative patients, 37 to 40 babies and 17 people in intensive care. Countless other people are seeking refuge in the hospital grounds. Two babies died in the Al-Shifa neonatal unit after power to their incubators was cut off, and a man also died when his ventilator shut down, the surgeon said in an audio message posted on social media. We can see actually the smoke around the hospital. They hit everything around the hospital, and they hit the hospital many times, he said. A sniper had shot four patients within the hospital, he said, with one man hit in the neck and another in the abdomen. People trying to leave the grounds to seek safety further south in Gaza had faced bombardments, the surgeon said. Grave concern The United Nations World Health Organization (WHO) expressed alarm at the situation in Al-Shifa. WHO is gravely concerned about the safety of health workers, hundreds of sick and injured patients, including babies on life support, and displaced people who remain inside the hospital, director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in a statement. The Israeli military has denied strikes or a siege at Al-Shifa hospital, and has repeatedly accused Hamas of using medical facilities as command centers and hideouts. Hamas has denied the accusations. The Israeli army also said it would provide the assistance needed to help babies in the pediatric department to get to a safer hospital on Sunday, at the request of Al-Shifa staff. Twenty of Gazas 36 hospitals are no longer functioning, according to the UNs humanitarian agency. The Palestinian Red Crescent Society also called on the international community and humanitarian groups to intervene immediately and urgently to protect people in Al-Quds Hospital, also in Gaza City. Artillery shelling nearby was causing the building to shake, the Red Crescent said Saturday, reporting intense shooting at the hospital where there were about 500 patients and more than 14,000 people seeking shelter. Infants were facing dehydration because of a lack of breast milk alternatives, it said. Other hospitals crippled by the fighting include the Indonesian hospital in north Gaza, where the director, Atef Al-Kahlot, said lack of fuel forced the facility to cut power to their desalination plant, medical scanners and lifts. The hospital is working with 30-40 percent of its capacity, Al-Kahlot said. The intense fighting has accelerated an exodus of people toward Gazas south. Tens of thousands of Palestinians are fleeing southwards each day through an evacuation corridor opened by the Israeli military on Friday, according to the UNs humanitarian affairs organization. In all, the Israeli army said Saturday that in the last three days, around 200,000 Palestinians had left southwards from the area of the northern Gaza Strip where fighting is heaviest. However, strikes were also hitting buildings at the southern end of Gaza in Rafah, the area of the densely populated territory to which civilians have been urged to evacuate. Source  AFP --Agencies",

        "date": "November 13, 2023 09:44 am",
        "content": "Sri Lanka is likely to raise taxes and curb spending in its annual budget to meet the International Monetary Funds conditions and maintain a 3 billion bailout, but elections next year might see the government delay some reforms. President Ranil Wickremesinghe is expected to announce a narrower budget deficit from the last fiscal years target of 7.9 of gross domestic product and lay out a road map to boost investments to aid economic recovery. Wickremesinghe, who is also the finance minister, needs to win over voters ahead of presidential elections due in 2024. In presenting the budget, Wickremesinghe is caught between meeting IMF targets and also positioning himself to win an election, said Dhananath Fernando, chief executive at Advocata Institute, a Colombo-based think tank. Wickremesinghe will present the budget on Monday at 12 noon. He came to power last year after a popular uprising ousted his predecessor Gotabaya Rajapaksa for his role in the countrys worst financial crisis in seven decades. The veteran politician delivered a deal from the IMF for Sri Lanka and he now needs to ensure it meets targets in order to unlock funds under the program. While progress on debt restructuring will be key to getting the IMF executive boards approval for a 330 million payout, Sri Lanka is struggling to increase government revenue with the Washington-based lender projecting a 15 shortfall this year. Higher taxes are pivotal for Sri Lanka to consistently receive funds, said Jeemin Bang, an economist with Moodys Analytics in Singapore. Bang expects enhanced fiscal discipline, a focus on low-income households and corruption prevention measures in the budget  in line with the IMF demands. Sri Lankas bondholders will also watch the path to meeting the IMF targets, which include reaching a primary surplus of 2.3 by 2025 and reducing debt to GDP from 128 last year. On Edge In 2022, food and fuel shortages led to long queues while businesses had to shutter for weeks with a lack of dollars and supplies, causing widespread anger. This year, there are signs of a turnaround as essential items are more readily available, foreign reserves have risen again with tourists returning to Sri Lanka, and factories restarting. Inflation has come down from a peak of 70 last year and the central bank has been cutting interest rates after an aggressive hiking cycle. Full recovery is not assured, the IMF said last month. For one, Sri Lanka needs to keep fuel and electricity rates at market prices so that the government recoups costs, it said. Sri Lanka has cleared a proposal to revise power tariffs quarterly from every six months. But any further hikes in utility prices and higher taxes may risk angering voters who are dealing with increased personal and corporate taxes and a planned jump in value-added tax. Things appear more promising on the debt restructuring front. Sri Lanka has carried out an exchange of local debt and struck a tentative deal with the Export-Import Bank of China. A group of dollar bondholders also submitted a restructuring proposal, though it received an unfavorable initial response from authorities. The focus now is on restructuring and making debt sustainable, Advocatas Fernando said. Providing stability for the private sector is very important because the government now has very little fiscal space to act even if debt is successfully restructured. Source  Bloomberg --Agencies",

The capital New Delhi took, as it often does, the top spot. It had an air quality index (AQI) figure of 420, putting it the hazardous category, according to Swiss group IQAir. But it was also joined in the top 10 by Kolkata in Indias east, which came in fourth with an AQI of 196, while the financial capital of Mumbai was eighth with an AQI of 163. An AQI level of 400-500 impacts healthy people and is dangerous to those with existing diseases, while a level of 150-200 brings discomfort to people with asthma, lung and heart problems. Levels of 0-50 are considered good. A thick layer of smog had begun to circulate in New Delhi from Sunday night, sending its AQI to an alarming 680 a little after midnight. Every year authorities impose bans on firecrackers in the capital, but only rarely do those bans appear to be enforced. Air quality in India deteriorates every year ahead of winter, when cold air traps pollutants from vehicles, industry, construction dust and agricultural waste burning. New Delhis authorities postponed an earlier decision to restrict use of vehicles after a brief spell of rain on Friday brought some respite from a week-long exposure to toxic air.

Just after 10 p.m. local time (5 p.m. ET) on Saturday, Ladispoli mayor Alessandro Grando announced on his Facebook page that the lion had been caught. The animal had been on the loose for at least 5 hours, causing concern and confusion among local residents. The lion has been sedated and captured. It will now be handed over by the circus staff. I thank the State Police, the Carabinieri, the Fire Department, the local and provincial police, the Asl Local Health Authority, and all the volunteers who served during these hours of great apprehension, Grando said on social media on Saturday evening. I hope that this episode will stir some consciences, and that we can finally put an end to the exploitation of animals in circuses, he added. Circus staff found broken lock Earlier on Saturday, Grando alerted local residents immediately after the animals escape, urging people to stay vigilant and advising them to stay at home. It was around 5 p.m. local time (11 a.m. ET) when it was announced the lion had escaped from the circus and that the animal was immediately tracked down within the adjacent waterway. Circus personnel are implementing the capture operations, with the support of Law Enforcement who promptly responded to the scene. Please exercise caution and avoid movement until further notice, the mayor said. But the lion managed to disappear again in a very dense reedbed and reappeared in town. The lion ran away again after spotting the police car, Grando told Italian national broadcaster RAI. When asked how the animal managed to escape from the circus, the mayor said a member of the circus staff saw three people running away and that they found a broken lock at the circus. They are talking about sabotage, Grando said, adding that the incident will now be investigated.y again after spotting the police car, Grando told Italian national broadcaster RAI. After escaping, the lion wandered around the streets of Ladispoli, a seaside town some 50km from Rome, and was filmed by many people from their homes or cars. Several videos on social media show the lion wandering around among parked cars and in front of the gates of houses. In order to catch the lion, veterinarians used a dart equipped with a geolocator, thanks to which the animal was eventually found and surrounded near a school, RAI reported. According to those at the scene, the lion was in good condition, although frightened and in a state of mild hypothermia, RAI also reported. The Carabinieri are investigating the incident. The Organization for the Protection of Animals (OIPA) said Saturday that this story highlights the danger of circuses with animals from the point of view of public safety and, above all, the discomfort of poor creatures forced into captivity to be used for entertainment purposes, adding that it hopes that a law banning circuses with animals will be introduced.

        "date": "November 13, 2023 10:50 am",
        "content": "More children in South Asia are struggling due to severe water scarcity made worse by the impacts of climate change than anywhere else worldwide, the United Nations said Monday. A staggering 347 million children under 18 are exposed to high or extremely high water scarcity in South Asia, the highest number among all regions in the world, the UN Childrens Agency said in a report. The eight-nation region, comprising Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Nepal, Maldives, Pakistan and Sri Lanka, is home to more than one-quarter of the worlds children. With an increasingly unpredictable climate, water scarcity is expected to become worse for children in South Asia. At the UN COP28 climate conference in December in Dubai, Unicef said it will call for leaders to secure a liveable planet. Safe water is a basic human right, said Sanjay Wijesekera, Unicef chief for South Asia. Yet millions of children in South Asia dont have enough to drink in a region plagued by floods, droughts and other extreme weather events, triggered increasingly by climate change. Last year, 45 million children lacked access to basic drinking water services in South Asia, more than any other region, but Unicef said services were expanding rapidly, with that number slated to be halved by 2030. Behind South Asia was Eastern and Southern Africa, where 130 million children are at risk from severe water scarcity, the report added. Source: South China Morning Post",

        "date": "November 13, 2023 12:05 pm",
        "content": "The International Cricket Council (ICC) has revealed the latest cricketing icons that are to be inducted into the ICC Hall of Fame as the Class of 2023. Following a voting process conducted among existing Hall of Famers, media representatives and senior executives from FICA and the ICC, three new names will be added to the prestigious list of legends that comprise the ICC Hall of Fame; Aravinda de Silva, Diana Edulji and Virender Sehwag. The ICC Hall of Fame honours the greatest international cricketers throughout the long history of the sport, and the enduring legacies of de Silva, Edulji and Sehwag see them join as inductees number 110, 111 and 112 respectively. De Silva enjoyed a 19-year international career for Sri Lanka, notably playing a starring role in their memorable run to victory at the ICC Mens Cricket World Cup in 1996. Sehwag was also a pivotal figure in the World Cup winning campaign for India in 2011, and his record-breaking career spanned 14 years and over 17,000 runs in international cricket. Edulji becomes the first Indian female inducted into the ICC Hall of Fame thanks to a 17-year international playing career and her pioneering role in establishing the most successful domestic team in Indian womens cricket history. As part of this years celebrations, the Class of 2023 will be inducted in a special on-field ceremony at the Wankhede Stadium, Mumbai during the first semi-final of the ICC Mens Cricket World Cup 2023 on 15 November. ICC Chief Executive Officer, Geoff Allardice commented: We are thrilled to announce Aravinda, Diana and Virender as the latest group of legends to be inducted into the ICC Hall of Fame. This institution continues to celebrate the extensive and vibrant history of the sport through the very best players ever to grace the international stage. These three figures have revolutionised the sport in their own way, and have provided fans with some of the most unforgettable moments in recent memory. Their lasting contributions to cricket mean they are richly deserving of their status in the ICC Hall of Fame and we look forward to celebrating the Class of 2023 in Mumbai later this week. Virender Sehwag: I would like to thank the ICC and the jury for inducting me with this honour. I feel extremely grateful for having spent a great part of my life doing what I loved most, hitting the cricket ball. I would also like to thank my family, friends, people I played with, and countless people who prayed for me selflessly. Aravinda de Silva: I am filled with profound gratitude as I accept the immense honour of being inducted into the ICC Hall of Fame. This achievement is a tribute to the dedication, sacrifice, and love that have shaped my cricketing journey. My family, my parents, my sister, my wife and children are my anchor, and deserve the deepest thanks for their unwavering support and sacrifice, which have propelled me towards success. My friends, steadfast companions throughout my highs and lows, have been my pillars of strength. To my coaches, teachers, fans and supporters, your relentless belief in me has fuelled my drive to succeed. My mentors and captains have guided and inspired me, and my teammates have been my extended family on this incredible journey. To the ones I have played against, thank you for enriching my game. My sincere appreciation goes to the ICC, and the Hall of Fame voting committee for this extraordinary recognition. I share this honour with all who have stood by and shaped me. Thank you for being part of this remarkable journey. Diana Edulji: At the outset, I would like to thank the ICC and the Jury for having selected me to be inducted in the ICC Hall Of Fame 2023. It indeed is a great honour to be the First Indian Women Cricketer to be inducted and join a galaxy of cricketers, male and female from across the world. I am delighted to be considered for this award. Its not only a proud moment for me, my family and friends but also for BCCI and Indian Womens Cricket. Aravinda de Silva 93 Tests  6,361 runs at an average of 42.97, 29 wickets 308 ODIs  9,284 runs at an average of 34.90, 106 wickets De Silva made his Test debut at Lords in 1984, and scored 75 as Sri Lanka recorded the first Test win in their history a year later, defeating India at Colombo. A first Test century followed against a Pakistan attack of Imran Khan, Wasim Akram and Abdul Qadir at Faisalabad the following month, and in 1991 he struck a then-national record individual score of 267 against New Zealand at Wellington. The all-rounder was instrumental in Sri Lankas World Cup winning campaign in 1996, and his contributions during a memorable Final against Australia in Lahore are written in cricket folklore. De Silva took three key wickets with his off-spin to restrict Australias score, before scoring an unbeaten 107 to navigate his side out of trouble to win their maiden global crown. He was the first to score a century and take three wickets in the same World Cup match  and is still the only one to do so in a Final. He signed off from Test cricket in 2002 with a double-century in his final innings and retired from all international cricket after the ICC Mens Cricket World Cup in 2003. Diana Edulji 20 Tests  404 runs, 63 wickets at an average of 25.77 34 ODIs  211 runs, 46 wickets at an average of 16.84 Edulji was a trailblazer who enjoyed a 17-year international career, and was arguably the first great female cricketer produced by India. A right-handed batter and slow left-arm bowler, only two women have taken more Test wickets, and none have bowled more deliveries. She played in three ICC Womens Cricket World Cups, captaining India in 1978 and 1993, taking 14 wickets in the latter tournament. She struck a half-century in just her second Test, and her best bowling figures were 6-64 against Australia at Delhi eight years later. However, her sphere of influence extended beyond the field of play. In 1984, she convinced the Railways Minister to field a womens cricket team, and subsequently Railways became the most successful side in Indian womens cricket. She won 11 national titles for Railways to add to the three she had previously won with Mumbai. By the time she retired after the 1993 World Cup, only Lyn Fullston had taken more wickets in all forms of international cricket. Virender Sehwag 104 Tests  8,586 runs at an average of 49.34, 40 wickets 251 ODIs  8,273 runs at an average of 35.05, 96 wickets 19 T20Is  394 runs at an average of 21.88 Originally a middle-order batter, Sehwag struck a century on his Test debut against South Africa and was soon moved up the order by Indias captain Sourav Ganguly. He revolutionised the openers role in Test cricket and ended up scoring more runs at a greater rate than anyone in Test history. Sehwag brought up Indias first Test triple-century in March 2004 with a six against Pakistan, and four years later he again passed the 300 mark against South Africa at Chennai from just 278 balls. He almost made it three Test triple centuries the following year, but fell seven runs short against Sri Lanka at Mumbai. Sehwag set a record ODI score of 219 against the West Indies in 2011, which stood for three years, and was instrumental in Indias march to victory in the ICC Mens Cricket World Cup in 2011, striking 175 in the opening game against Bangladesh and displaying his trademark explosive approach by hitting boundaries from the first ball of Indias innings on five separate occasions.

Accordingly, a group of 25 experts have been appointed to prepare a new national education policy framework, which was adapted by the Cabinet. Under these reforms, several key institutions are slated to be established, including the Higher National Council on Education, National Higher Education Commission and the National Skills Commission, President Wickremesinghe said, adding that further details in this regard will be revealed in Parliament by the Minister of Education within the next two weeks. Speaking further in relation to the expansion of state universities, the Head of State noted that four new universities would be established, considering the current trends for the technical sector. Accordingly, the Seethawaka Science and Technology, Kurunegala Technology University under the Kotelawala Defence University, Management and Technology University and the International University of Climate Change are slated to be established. Furthermore, the Head of State also highlighted the need to enhance state universities to suit the modern era, adding that a program to do so will be initiated, starting with the University of Peradeniya. Rs. 500 million will be allocated for the initial development activities of this programme aimed at the centenary celebrations of Peradeniya University in 2042. Meanwhile, four private institutions, namely, NSBM, Sri Lanka Institute of Information Technology (SLIIT), Horizon Campus and the Royal Institute of Colombo (RIC), are also set to be converted to private universities, as part of the new reforms. With regards to non-state universities, the President noted that Sri Lanka will henceforth allow for any recognised educational institution in the world to establish universities in Sri Lanka, following the implementation of a set of rules for the regulation of non-state universities. This will create opportunities for every student who passes G.C.E (Advanced Level) to obtain university education and earn foreign exchange through the admission of foreign students. Loan facilities will be provided to students studying in these non-state universities. In addition to the existing interest-free student loan scheme, I propose to implement a subsidized student loan scheme through commercial banks. Arrangements will be made to repay the loan after getting a job, President Wickremesinghe further said in this regard. The Head of State made these revelations while delivering the 2024 Budget speech in Parliament this morning (13 Nov.), in his capacity as the Minister of Finance.",

        "content": "The Sri Lankan Head of the State, delivering the 2024 budget proposal to the Parliament, stated that an additional allocation of Rs. 55 billion will be directed towards completing projects that were temporarily halted due to the economic crisis and to provide necessary provisions for other capital expenditure proposals. The President, who emphasized that a new mechanism to approve development projects has already been introduced, mentioned that a government committee has been established to review new projects. As per recommendations of the Committee, the Minister of Finance will grant approval for projects, he said, adding that the government would not allocate funds for projects that deviate from this procedure. Meanwhile, this will enable the allocation of capital expenditure to give a higher contribution to economic growth, according to the President. This is very important for fiscal and debt sustainability. To achieve this objective, I will increase capital expenditure to Rs. 1,260 billion. This is equal to 4 per cent of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP), he added. Furthermore, he mentioned that this allocation would be made by transferring Rs. 55 billion from the Vote of the National Budget Department to Capital Expenditure Vote. Thus, we would allocate Rs. 1,260 billion for the development activities of next year. In addition, the projects implemented under foreign loans and grants which were temporarily suspended will be allowed to recommence after the completion of foreign debt restructuring activities, according to the President. He also said that since it is observed that the project management committees have been unable to achieve expected objectives for the development projects, a unit should be established for this purpose under each Ministry from 2024 onward, to include project-related activities to the duty list of the permanent staff and to procure human resources under contract and duty basis only when related specialists are not available in the public sector.",

If we allocated that building for the tourism industry at the right time, we still have that historic landmark building. And we earn foreign exchange.",

        "content": "In the budgetary allocations for the fiscal year of 2024, the Sri Lankan government has earmarked Rs. 3 trillion for the implementation of foreign debt restructuring and settlement of international sovereign bonds. Delivering the 2024 Budget Speech in the parliament this afternoon, President Ranil Wickremesinghe spoke on the measures the island nation has taken to bounce back from the economic crisis. Due to the space created by the debt restructuring process, the government was able to find resources for relief measures, the Head of State added. He pointed out that under the debt restructuring supported by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Sri Lankas public debt as a percentage of GDP is expected to go down from 128 in 2022 to 95 in 2032. After the completion of the debt restructuring process, the overall macroeconomic stability and the stability of the financial sector will be further strengthened. We have now been able to achieve significant progress in the debt restructuring process. Key aspects of domestic debt optimization are completed. As part of the restructuring of International Sovereign Bonds under the External Debt Restructuring process, Sri Lankas net debt is reduced to its present value. USD denominated new financial instruments should be issued to settle existing international sovereign bonds. Accordingly, for the settlement of existing International Sovereign Bonds, budgetary allocations are required to record the transaction in the government book of accounts.",

On November 07, the Court of Appeal issued 14-day stay orders preventing the operation of the seven-member Interim Committee appointed for the Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) and the relevant gazette notification issued by Sports Minister Roshan Ranasinghe in this regard, after considering a writ petition filed by the Chairman of SLC Shammi Silva. Accordingly, the court had issued three stay orders in total pertaining to the matter: the first to prevent the gazette issued by the Sports Minister appointing the interim committee for the SLC, the second to prevent the committee members chaired by Arjuna Ranatunga from acting in their respective positions and the third to prevent the respondents including the Sports Minister from interfering the activities of the petitioner and the other officials of cricket board.

        "title": "UK PM fires interior minister, brings ex-leader Cameron back to government",
        "date": "November 13, 2023 04:35 pm",
        "content": "Former British Prime Minister David Cameron made a shock return to high office on Monday, becoming foreign secretary in a major shakeup of the Conservative government that also saw the firing of divisive Home Secretary Suella Braverman. Cameron, who led the government between 2010 and 2016, was appointed by Prime Minister Rishi Sunak in a Cabinet shuffle in which he sacked Braverman, a divisive figure who drew anger for accusing police of being too lenient with pro-Palestinian protesters. She was replaced by James Cleverly, who had been foreign secretary. Camerons appointment came as a surprise to seasoned politics-watchers. Its rare for a non-lawmaker to take a senior government post, and it has been decades since a former prime minister held a Cabinet job. The government said Cameron will be appointed to Parliaments unelected upper chamber, the House of Lords. The last foreign secretary to serve in the Lords, rather than the elected House of Commons, was Peter Carrington, who was part of Prime Minister Margaret Thatchers government in the 1980s. It marks the return to government of a leader brought down by Britains decision to leave the European Union. Cameron called the 2016 EU membership referendum, confident the country would vote to stay in the bloc. He resigned the day after voters opted to leave. Sunak was a strong backer of the winning leave side in the referendum. Bravermans exit was less surprising. Sunak had been under growing pressure to fire Braverman  a hard-liner popular with the authoritarian wing of the governing Conservative Party  from one of the most senior jobs in government, responsible for handling immigration and policing. In a highly unusual attack on the police last week, Braverman said Londons police force was ignoring lawbreaking by pro-Palestinian mobs. She described demonstrators calling for a cease-fire in Gaza as hate marchers. On Saturday, far-right protesters scuffled with police and tried to confront a large pro-Palestinian march by hundreds of thousands through the streets of London. Critics accused Braverman of helping to inflame tensions. Last week Braverman wrote an article for the Times of London in which she said police play favorites when it comes to protesters and acted more leniently toward pro-Palestinian demonstrators and Black Lives Matter supporters than to right-wing protesters or soccer hooligans. The article was not approved in advance by the prime ministers office, as would usually be the case. Braverman said Monday it has been the greatest privilege of my life to serve as home secretary, adding that she would have more to say in due course. Braverman, a 43-year-old lawyer, has become a leader of the partys populist wing by advocating ever-tougher curbs on migration and a war on human rights protections, liberal social values and what she has called the tofu-eating wokerati. Last month she called migration a hurricane that would bring millions more immigrants to these shores, uncontrolled and unmanageable. As home secretary Braverman championed the governments stalled plan to send asylum-seekers who arrive in Britain in boats on a one-way trip to Rwanda. A U.K. Supreme Court ruling on whether the policy is legal is due on Wednesday. Critics say Braverman has been building her profile to position herself for a party leadership contest that could come if the Conservatives lose power in an election expected next year. Opinion polls for months have put the party 15 to 20 points behind the opposition Labour Party. Source - ABC News - Agencies",

        "date": "November 13, 2023 05:09 pm",
        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe, in his capacity as the Minister of Finance, Economic Stabilization and National Policies, presented proposed budgetary allocations for the fiscal year 2024, in parliament today (Nov.13). He underscored the transformative nature of the 2024 budget, positioning it as a pivotal step towards shaping the countrys future and establishing a modern economic framework aligned with global trends. The Head of State called for cooperation from all political parties, transcending partisan boundaries to collectively forge a new path for the nation through the proposed program. The budget outlines the comprehensive vision for the upcoming fiscal year, aiming to set the stage for sustained progress and prosperity. In the 2024 Budget, themed A Prelude to a Bright Future, the Sri Lankan government has projected ambitious revenue and budget deficit targets. According to Wickremesinghe, the budget deficit for the fiscal year 2024 is estimated at Rs. 2,851 billion, or 9.1 as a percentage of the GDP. This is higher than the revised 8.5 of GDP in the current year. The original target for 2023 was 7.9. The total expenditure for next year has been set at a record Rs. 6,978 billion, an increase of nearly 33 compared to 2023, with capital expenditure more than doubling and Rs. 450 billion reserved for bank recapitalization. In the 78th Budget, the Sri Lankan government has allocated Rs. 5,277 billion for recurring expenditures such as subsidies and salary payments. For salaries and wages, Rs. 1,127 billion has been earmarked, and Rs. 1,158 billion for subsidies and transfers. The Sri Lankan government has also allocated a staggering Rs. 3,000 billion to restructure foreign debt and to repay international sovereign bonds in 2024. He also proposed to raise the debt ceiling by Rs. 3,450 billion to Rs. 7,350 billion, from Rs. 3,900 billion. The total projected revenue will be Rs. 4,107 billion (including tax revenue of Rs. 3,820 billion). The Head of State said the governments revenue target for 2023 is Rs. 3,415 billion, however, only Rs. 2,410 billion has been collected in the days that have elapsed this year. This represents that we have failed to generate the targeted revenue. We have to work hard to collect the targeted revenue. He mentioned that until foreign debt restructuring is completed, the foreign financing and loans the country can obtain are constrained. Bank overdrafts amounting to Rs. 900 billion have been obtained in the year 2021. Currently, the total overdrafts are brought to a lower level of Rs. 70 billion. According to the new Central Bank Act, money printing is not allowed. Wickremesinghe warned that the country would end up again in an economic hell unless the government revenue is increased by 10 to 15. This issue cannot be resolved by simple and sweet promises, as some groups are proposing. Speaking further, the Head of State also emphasized that the governments should stop propagating lies for political motives. He also underscored the importance of streamlining tax collection to make sure that high-income people do not slip through. We have identified several critical issues in our tax system. At present the burden of taxes is placed only on a few slices of the society. Tax evasion happens due to the long-lasting weaknesses and negligence of the tax collection systems. Wickremesinghe said the 2024 Budget has proposed several measures to rectify these issues, highlighting that these proposals need to be implemented gradually. We will be able to provide more tax concessions in the future when the government revenue is increased through these proposals. He proposed that a special penal provision be introduced to prosecute people who have not submitted tax returns and information required by the tax officials. In addition, the Tax Identification Number (TIN) will be made a mandatory requirement to open a current account at any bank, obtain approval for a building plan by the applicant, register a motor vehicle or renew a license by the owner, and register a land or title to a land by the buyer. The president also underscored the necessity of unnecessary expenditure. The public suffers due to the loss-making state-owned enterprises (SOEs). The loss of these institutions is borne by the public. He hit out at the political groups that call them national treasures, accusing them of piling up the burden of these loss-making state-owned enterprises and pulling the whole nation backward. Addressing the demands of salary increments, Wickremesinghe explained that this cannot be done on an ad-hoc basis, adding that 35 of government revenue is spent to public sector pay salaries. To increase salaries, the revenue of the government also has to be increased. To make sure that Sri Lanka does not recede into another crisis, the president said the countrys economic and political systems must be created anew. A new social consensus should be established. What we have done in this budget document is to lay the foundation for it. Budget 2024-President Ranil... by Adaderana Online National Budget 2024 - English by Adaderana Online",

A recent report from the Parliamentary Committee on Ways and Means highlighted a loss of 1.4 billion rupees in recent times, attributing it to discretionary powers granted to customs officers in determining fines for smuggling restricted goods into the country, said customs media spokesman Sivali Arukgoda. The committee also revealed a surge in the smuggling of gold, mobile phones, and other valuable items over the past three years following import restrictions. Arukgoda said since June 2023 individuals caught bringing in restricted valuable items could face fines three times the value of the goods or a 100,000 rupees penalty. As of Oct. 31, customs had collected 760 billion rupees in revenue, with expectations that total customs revenue for the year would surpass 925 billion rupees, Arukgoda said.

        "content": "Nepal said on Monday it would ban Chinas TikTok, adding that social harmony and goodwill were being disturbed by misuse of the popular video app and there was rising demand to control it. TikTok has already been either partially or completely banned by other countries, with many citing security concerns. More than 1,600 TikTok-related cyber crime cases have been registered over the last four years in Nepal, according to local media reports. Nepals Minister for Communications and Information Technology Rekha Sharma said the decision to ban TikTok had been made at a cabinet meeting earlier on Monday. Colleagues are working on closing it technically, Sharma told Reuters. Nepal Telecom Authority Chair Purushottam Khanal said that internet service providers have been asked to close the app. Some have already closed while others are doing it later today, Khanal told Reuters. TikTok did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the matter. It has previously said such bans are misguided and that they are based on misconceptions. Opposition leaders in Nepal criticised the move, saying that it lacked effectiveness, maturity and responsibility. There are many unwanted materials in other social media also. What must be done is to regulate and not restrict them, Pradeep Gyawali, former foreign minister and a senior leader of the Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist-Leninist), said. Nepals neighbour India banned TikTok along with dozens of other apps by Chinese developers in June 2020, saying that they could compromise national security and integrity. Another South Asian country, Pakistan, has banned the app at least four times over what the countrys government terms its immoral and indecent content. Source  Reuters --Agencies",

Meanwhile, an online license-issuing system is also set to be introduced, so as to provide a customer-friendly and effective regulatory environment, while an administrative fees on the services provided by the Excise Department will also be introduced. President Wickremesinghe also stated that a committee will be appointed to evaluate the security features and their management systems, in order to address an array of issues including fake or counterfeit stickers.

        "date": "November 13, 2023 10:01 pm",
        "content": "A father who was assaulted and racially abused while visiting Ballarat in Australia with his young daughter, who lives with a disability, says he may never return to the regional Victorian city. The Nugagahakumbura familys trip from Melbourne was not easy to plan; 12-year-old Anuli lives with cerebral palsy, uses a wheelchair, is blind and needed to be accompanied by a carer. Thusitha Nugagahakumbura said he, his wife Neelanthi Munasinghe, Anuli and her carer were heading back to their car after a day of sightseeing when a group of boys started shouting at them, and a metal chain was hurled at the girls face. I asked, Whats wrong with you? Mr Nugagahakumbura said. He then just came in, without telling me anything, and started to punch me. Mr Nugagahakumbura said he was forced to defend himself while trying to get his family into the car as he called triple-0. By the time that I was getting onto Ballarat police, the boy stopped punching me, he said. The group got into a bus  and left. I was shocked. Mr Nugagahakumbura, whose family has lived in Melbourne since they came to Australia a decade ago, said Anulis carer heard the group shouting racial slurs during the attack, which occurred in early October. Kate Skinner, who raced to intervene when the assault occurred, told ABC Statewide Drive the area near Coles on Peel Street was a known trouble spot. My daughter said  Mum, that family is in danger  theyre hitting that family, she said. So we just took off and started sprinting over. Ms Skinner said there were seven to nine boys surrounding the terrified family. They were absolutely traumatised, she said. My daughter stepped up to the kids, which was so brave, but she just knew that if she didnt, those kids were not leaving. It was like they were a pack of hyenas. Ms Skinner said one of the boys was using a small chain as a weapon and that the mother of a child in the group was also shouting at the family. It was disgusting, she said. Ballarat police station is only a few minutes walk from where the incident occurred, but officers did not attend the scene. Mr Nugagahakumbura was told by police to file a report at the station because the offenders had by then left the area. Im not much familiar with Ballarat, right  this is the second time in the last 10 years that Ive visited Ballarat, he said. Police told Mr Nugagahakumbura there was no CCTV footage of the attack, despite the centrality of the location. We are not living in the 18th or 19th century, Mr Nugagahakumbura said. If someone needs to find someone, there are so many ways of doing that. Ms Skinner said she saw three horrible-looking men filming the assault. Someones got the phone, someones got the video, she said. In a statement, Victoria Police told the ABC an investigation into the incident was continuing. Police units in Ballarat were attending another incident at the time, the statement said. The victim was requested to attend the police station so written statements could be obtained and an investigation could be commenced as a priority. Ballarat Mayor Des Hudson said the incident was absolutely horrendous. Disgusting and deplorable behaviour on the part of every person who played a part to traumatise the family that was here visiting, he said. They just shouldnt have had to endure that particular type of behaviour. This is not usual Ballarat behaviour. Cr Hudson acknowledged that the transport interchange on Little Bridge Street had been a problem for a long, long time and said that recently, some of the seating and shelters had been removed to try to address antisocial behaviour in the area. He also said the lack of surveillance footage concerned him, and that the area would receive a CCTV upgrade when improvements to Bridge Mall were made. Cr Hudson said he hoped the family would return to the city, but Mr Nugagahakumbura has his doubts. I dont think well come back to Ballarat because it will give us a lot of mental stress, he said. Even visiting some other places  we havent thought of that, but it would be really hard. Source: ABC --Agencies",

        "content": "(AP)  Rescuers were digging through dirt and parts of a collapsed road tunnel Monday to reach 40 workers trapped by a landslide at the construction project in northern India. All of the construction workers are safe, police officer Prashant Kumar said, adding that they have been supplied with oxygen and water. He said the rescuers had established contact with the trapped individuals. The collapse occurred Sunday in Uttarakhand, a mountainous state dotted with Hindu temples that attracts many pilgrims and tourists. Massive construction of buildings and roadways have taken place in recent years in Uttarakhand. The trapped workers were building part of the Chardham all-weather road, a flagship federal government project connecting various Hindu pilgrimage sites. The number of workers trapped was confirmed Monday by Rajesh Pawar, the project manager at the Navyug Construction Company, which is overseeing the construction of the tunnel. Rescue efforts began Sunday, with authorities pumping oxygen through a pipe into the collapsed section of the tunnel to help workers breathe. The team has progressed 15 meters (yards) into the tunnel, with an additional 35 meters (yards) yet to cover, Kumar said, adding that more than 150 rescuers had used drilling equipment and excavators to clear debris through the night. The collapsed portion of the 4.5-kilometer (2.7-mile) tunnel is about 200 meters (500 feet) from the entrance, officials told the Press Trust of India news agency. In January, Uttarakhand state authorities moved hundreds of people to temporary shelters after a temple collapsed and cracks appeared in over 600 houses because of the sinking of land in and around Joshimath town in the region.

        "title": "WHO says Gazas largest hospital becoming a cemetery",
        "date": "November 14, 2023 08:46 am",
        "content": "Thousands could be trapped inside Gazas largest hospital due to nearby fighting, while officials have warned of rotting bodies piling up there. Al-Shifa Hospital, which is also tackling power cuts and a lack of fuel, is nearly a cemetery, the World Health Organization (WHO) has warned. The hospitals manager said it was under a blockade, and that dogs had started eating corpses. The area around the hospital has seen intense fighting in recent days. US President Joe Biden said he hoped to see less intrusive action at the hospital, which he said must be protected. Gaza City has seen an intensification of fighting between Israeli and Hamas forces in recent days, much of which has been taking place in streets close to the hospital. There have been reports of tanks and armoured vehicles being within metres of the hospital gate. Israel accuses Hamas of operating a command-and-control centre in tunnels underneath the hospital, which Hamas and the hospital deny. It also accuses Hamas, which governs the Gaza Strip, of preventing humanitarian solutions. Israels army has also said that while there are clashes close to Al-Shifa, there is no shooting at the hospital itself nor a siege, and that anyone wanting to leave can do so. Christian Lindmeier, a spokesman for the WHO, said about 600 people remained in the hospital, with others sheltering in hallways. Around the hospital there are dead bodies which cannot be taken care of or not even be buried or taken away to any sort of morgue, he said. The hospital is not working at all any more as it should. Its nearly a cemetery. The Hamas-run health ministry has said there are at least 2,300 people still inside the hospital - up to 650 patients, 200 to 500 staff and around 1,500 people seeking shelter. Doctors have also spoken of bodies piling up and rotting at the hospital, and Dr Mohamed Abu Selmia, Al-Shifas manager, said there were about 150 bodies decomposing, leaving unpleasant odours. He told the BBC the Israeli authorities had still not granted permission for those bodies to leave the hospital to be buried, and that dogs had now entered the hospital grounds and started eating the bodies. There are also concerns about the fate of dozens of premature babies that are no longer able to stay in their incubators due to the power cuts. Dr Selmia said seven of those babies have now died due to a lack of oxygen. He said negotiations had been conducted with Israeli authorities to try to evacuate the babies, but that no agreement had been reached. Mark Regev, a senior adviser to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, said Israel was offering practical solutions to evacuate the babies, but accused Hamas of not accepting proposals. They dont take the fuel that was offered for their generators. They dont support the movement of babies out in ambulances, so of course theyre stuck there because Hamas want those terrible photographs, he said. He also accused Hamas of turning the hospital into a war zone by building tunnels underneath it. Hamas denies using the hospital for its operations, while doctors inside insist there is no Hamas presence there. As well as Al-Shifa, other hospitals across the Gaza Strip have reported widespread issues, including a lack of supplies and power due to the fighting and the blockade Israel has enforced on the territory since Hamas launched its attacks on Israel on 7 October.

        "date": "November 14, 2023 11:25 am",
        "content": "The chief of the Sri Lanka Cricket Selection Committee, Pramodya Wickramasinghe on Tuesday (Nov.14) released a statement expressing his views on the plight of the sport in the country. Wickramasinghe dismissed the criticisms levelled against the national cricket selection committee over the past two and a half years were untrue and destructive. He is of the view that the current adversities faced by Sri Lankan cricket were the result of a multifaceted conspiratorial plans that had been operating at various levels the past two and a half years to fulfil personal ambitions. The chief selector said the ban imposed on Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) by the International Cricket Council (ICC) on Saturday was also a consequence of this scheme. Behind this conspiracy, he said were certain individuals who were vying for power in the cricket governing body, brokers involved in match-fixing, and the players who were trying hard to secure their spot in the national team. The ultimate goal was to cause the downfall of the cricket administration. These conspirators have invested significant amounts of money to disseminate certain views and opinions in their favour on social media platforms and to include certain players of their liking into the national team, Wickramasinghe alleged. The objective of these conspiracies, he said was to evoke extensive criticism against the countrys cricket. One way of doing so is to create a strong political opinion against the SLC administration. But, the conspirators followed another method, which is to create a public opinion that the SLC administration is lacking, Wickramasinghe said. For this purpose, they often the pick out the weaknesses of the national team to undermine the cricket selection committee, the coaches and the players, he added. The appointment of the new sports minister added fuel to the fire, Wickramasinghe said, praising the former subject ministers for giving their utmost support for the functioning of the cricket selection committee. Wickramasinghe also pointed out that a major criticism against the selection committee was not recalling the senior players to the team. He claimed that the conspirators had shed crocodile tears about introducing new players to the national team, accusing the selection team of arriving at erroneous decisions. He also took issue with the sports ministry for lacking a firm policy on selection, citing as an example the ministers refusal to include the injured players Wanindu Hasaranga and Dushmantha Chameera in the national squad for the 2023 ICC Mens Cricket World Cup in India, despite the selection committee nominating them.

He made this statement when the motion was called before the Appellate Court bench comprising Justice Karunaratne himself and Judge Vikum Kaluarachchi. In addition, it was decided that the motion be heard before a new bench of the Appeals Court.

        "content": "Justice Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe on Tuesday (Nov.14) made revealed about the progress of the payment of compensation to the victims of Easter Sunday bombings by the respondents of the fundamental rights (FR) petitions filed over the 2019 carnage. Just over Rs. 36 million out of the total amount of Rs. 311 million due to be paid in compensation to the victims as per the orders of the Supreme Court, has been received by the Office for Reparations, Minister Rajapakshe said. Speaking during todays parliamentary session, the minister mentioned that former President Sirisena has deposited Rs. 15 million out of the Rs. 100 million he was ordered to pay. Meanwhile, the other respondents of the petitions, filed over the failure to take action to prevent the Easter Sunday attacks despite receiving sufficient intelligence information, have deposited the following sums to the Office for Reparations  former Inspector General of Police (IGP) Pujith Jayasundara, Rs 1.725 million; former chief of State Intelligence Service (SIS) DIG Nilantha Jayawardena, Rs 4.1 million; and former Defence Secretary Hemasiri Fernando, Rs 5 million. Notably, former chief of National Intelligence Sisira Mendis has fulfilled compensation payment of Rs 10 million he was ordered to pay, while the government has also completed the payment of Rs. 1 million to the Office for Reparations. Furthermore, the Justice Minister highlighted that the Office for Reparations has prepared a procedure to make the relevant payments, and submitted it to the court, adding that however, the compensation can be paid to the victims once the full payments are received by the Office for Reparations. The Supreme Court, which ruled that former President, former Defence Secretary, former IGP, former National Intelligence Chief and former Chief of SIS had violated the Fundamental Rights of petitioners, by failing to take action to prevent the Easter Sunday attacks despite receiving sufficient intelligence information, ordered them to pay compensation to the victims of the Easter Sunday attacks, early in 2023.

        "content": "SriLankan Airlines has advanced its passenger services at Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) with the introduction of self-service check-in and self-bag-drop services. This initiative is set to redefine the travel experience, placing convenience and efficiency at the forefront, Sri Lankas national carrier said in a statement. The new self-service kiosks aim to minimize waiting times during peak periods, allowing passengers to seamlessly navigate through the check-in process and swiftly proceed to Emigration. Frequent travellers, in particular, will appreciate the streamlined check-in procedure facilitated by the user-friendly self-service kiosks with self-bag drop located in the departure terminal of BIA, it added. Accordingly, passengers will be able to independently complete the entire check-in process, including flight check-in, seat selection, and the printing of boarding passes and bag tags. Following this, they can effortlessly drop off their luggage at the self-bag-drop facility, proceeding directly to the boarding gates after emigration clearance. Senior Manager of Airport and Ground Handling, Deepal Pallegangoda, emphasized the significance of this development, stating, As the official ground handler for all airlines operating out of BIA, SriLankan Airlines handles over 550,000 passengers and their luggage monthly. The introduction of these self-service facilities not only sets a new standard for airport convenience but also enables us to manage the check-in process more efficiently to meet the demands of our growing passenger numbers.

Group Head of Information Technology of SriLankan Airlines, Chamara Perera, expressed excitement about the launch, stating, We are ecstatic to equip our airlines hub with the best-in-class self-service technology, elevating passengers pre-flight experience to another level. This initiative not only allows travellers flying out of BIA to bypass queues at the check-in counters entirely but also marks a significant step forward in Sri Lankas roadmap to digitally transform the countrys airports. As the national carrier, we are proud to lead this project, enhancing the passenger experience on our journey towards contactless travel.",

        "date": "November 14, 2023 02:47 pm",
        "content": "The Cabinet sub-committee appointed to look into the gazette issued by Sports Minister Roshan Ranasinghe appointing an Interim Committee for Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) and the future activities of the cricket board, has been authorised to make decisions pertaining to the International Cricket Councils (ICC) suspension of SLCs membership. President Ranil Wickremesinghe has instructed the Chairman of the Ministerial Sub-Committee for Cricket, Minister Ali Sabry, to spearhead efforts aimed at lifting the suspension imposed by the International Cricket Council (ICC) on Sri Lanka Cricket, the PMD said. Further, it has been decided that, moving forward, the approval of the cabinet will be mandatory for the appointment of any interim committees, the Presidents Media Division reported. On 10 November, the ICC suspended SLCs membership, with immediate effect, on the grounds that the governing body is in serious breach of its obligations as a Member, in particular, the requirement to manage its affairs autonomously and ensure that there is no government interference in the governance, regulation andor administration of cricket in Sri Lanka. Thus, while the conditions of the suspension are to be decided by the ICC board in due course, the Board is slated to meet on 21 November, after which the future course of SLC is expected to be clearer. On 06 November, President Wickremesinghe had appointed a four-member committee, chaired by Minister Ali Sabry, and comprising of Ministers Tiran Alles, Manusha Nanayakkara and Kanchana Wijesekara, to look into matters concerning SLC, after Sports Minister Roshan Ranasinghe had decided to appoint a seven-member Interim Committee for SLC, chaired by World Cup-winning former Sri Lanka captain Arjuna Ranatunga. The Interim Committee, comprising of retired Supreme Court judges S.I. Imam and Rohini Marasinghe, retired High Court judge Irangani Perera, Upali Dharmasena, Attorney-at-Law Rakitha Rajapakshe and Hisham Jamaldeen, had been appointed to carry out the boards operations until further notice or until an election is held, under the authority granted to him by the Sports Law No. 25 of 1973. However, President Ranil Wickremesinghe had not been notified about the sports ministers decision to appoint the said interim committee, its composition or the decision to suspend the previous board. Internal sources said the Head of State had only come to know of the interim panels appointment through media report. Thus, the ministerial sub-committee was appointed to look into the sports ministers move, with the consent of the Sports Minister and the President. The Court of Appeals, on 07 November, however, issued a 14-day stay order preventing the operation of the seven-member Interim Committee appointed for SLC and the relevant gazette notification issued by Sports Minister Roshan Ranasinghe in this regard. The order was delivered by a two-member judge bench upon the consideration of a writ petition filed by the Chairman of SLC Shammi Silva.",
