        "title": "Baltimore bridge collapse: Two bodies recovered from underwater wreckage",
        "date": "March 28, 2024 08:43 am",
        "content": "The bodies of two people have been recovered from a red pickup truck, which was submerged under the water where the Baltimore Bridge collapsed. Eight construction workers were on the bridge when a ship struck it, plunging them into the waters below. Two of the workers were rescued on the day, but the search continues for the other four - all presumed dead. Salvage crews are working to address hazardous materials and accident investigators are on the scene. Four of the six victims of the bridge collapse have been named so far. At a press conference on Wednesday, Maryland State Police identified Alejandro Hernandez Fuentes, 35, and Dorlian Ronial Castillo Cabrera, 26, as the two workers recovered by divers from inside the truck. Mr Fuentes is originally from Mexico and Mr Cabrera is from Guatemala. But divers are no longer able to safely navigate the waters because of concrete and debris found in the river, police said. They are now using sonar scans and believe that vehicles that may contain other bodies are encased in superstructure and concrete that came down from the bridge, an official said. Two other missing victims, who are presumed dead, have also been named: Miguel Luna, originally from El Salvador, and Maynor Suazo Sandoval, a Honduran citizen. Mexicos Ministry of Foreign Affairs said earlier that two of its citizens were presumed dead - one of whom is now identified as Mr Fuentes - while another was rescued from the water. One person who was in hospital after being pulled out of the water was released, officials said late Wednesday. First responders spent hours on Tuesday searching the waters of the Patapsco River for the six construction workers, who were working on potholes on the bridge around 01:30 (05:30 GMT) when the ship crashed into the bridge. The US Coast Guard called off the search around sunset, saying cold water temperatures and hours gone by meant the workers were presumed dead. Officials have pledged to find the bodies of the men for their relatives. Weve got to give these families closure, Mr Moore told reporters on Wednesday, adding that air, land and water resources have been devoted to the search of the victims. My promise to them is this: I will devote every single resource to make sure that you receive closure, he said. But the operation has been challenging, Coast Guard Vice Admiral Peter Gautier said on Wednesday. Divers have been swimming in chilly waters with metal debris from the bridge that fell in the river. The cargo vessel itself is stable but has over 1.5m gallons of fuel oil and lube oil on board, Mr Gautier said. Roughly 4,700 cargo containers were also on board, including 56 that contained hazardous materials. The Coast Guard has moved aggressively to board the vessel, and we have teams on board, Mr Gautier said. The US Navy plans to use barges with heavy lift cranes - some can carry as much as 1,000 tonnes - to remove parts of the bridge that fell in the water. Investigations into what went wrong on the ship will be crucial, marine specialist Jim Bellingham told the BBC. An enormous advantage is that the ship didnt sink so theyll get access to bridge records and hopefully recordings of what was going on, he said. Officials are hoping that a data recorder they took from the ship overnight will provide more information. The Dali was headed toward Sri Lanka when it lost power all of a sudden and issued a distress call before crashing into the Baltimore bridge. Officials say the bridge collapse at a key port could pose a risk to global supply chains and the US economy. Maryland Governor Wes Moore said that 8,000 jobs could be affected by the bridge collapse and called the incident a global crisis. The national economy and global economy depends on the port, he said, noting that 80bn (63.4bn) of cargo moved through there last year. Source: BBC -Agencies",

        "content": "A new method will be introduced starting Thursday (28) to submit complaints concerning any online records of child sexual abuse, the National Child Protection Authority (NCPA) says. According to NCPA chairman Senior Lecturer Udayakumara Amarasinghe, the complaints can now be lodged online via the official website of the regulatory government authority responsible for the protection of children. The complaints received by the NCPA will be directly reported to the UK-based Internet Watch Foundation (IWF), a global charity working to hunt down and remove videos and images of child sexual abuse shared online. Each report received by the IWF will subsequently be manually assessed by its highly trained analysts and necessary measures will be taken to remove online images and videos of child sexual abuse victims. The IWF says when it traces the content to being hosted in other countries, it is reported to the UK National Crime Agency (NCA) which will then forward it to INTERPOL, the international police organisation, so they can pass it on to the hosting countrys police.",

        "content": "Bodu Bala Sena (BBS) General Secretary Ven. Galagodaaththe Gnanasara Thero has been sentenced to four years of rigorous imprisonment for the defamatory comments made against Islam in late 2016. The verdict was delivered by Colombo High Court Judge Aditya Patabendige on Thursday (March 28) while imposing a fine of Rs. 100,000 on the monk. Gnanasara Thero is accused of making defamatory comments against Islam during a 2016 media briefing convened on the Kuragala Buddhist monastery, causing damage to national and religious harmony. The judge found the monk guilty of the two indictments filed by the Attorney General under the Penal Code. Accordingly, the accused was sentenced to two years of rigorous imprisonment for each indictment and was imposed two fines of Rs. 50,000 each. He also ordered that the two sentences be served separately. Gnanasara Theros prison sentence will be extended by two more years in the event of his failure to pay the fine. Presenting submission before the court during todays proceedings, the defense attorney argued that his clients remarks were based on the situation that prevailed in the country at the time. However, the judge, delivering the verdict, ruled that the allegations levelled against Gnanasara Thero by the prosecution have been proved beyond reasonable doubt, adding it became evident during the trial that the statement in question was not accidental but deliberate. Pointing out that such statements disrupts the religious harmony and unity in the country, the judge emphasized that the accused failed to fulfil his responsibility as a religious leader who is entrusted with maintaining the inter-faith harmony. Further, the judge informed Gnanasara Thero that he is allowed to appeal the verdict. The case had been filed based on a complaint filed by former MPs Mujibur Rahman and Azath Salley.",

The official toll from the attack on Crocus City Hall now stands at 140 dead and 182 wounded. But the Baza news service, which has good contacts in Russian security and law enforcement, said 95 more people appeared in lists compiled by the emergency services based on appeals from people about missing relatives. These lists include people with whom relatives have not been able to get in touch since the terrorist attack, but who are not on the lists of wounded and dead, Baza said. Some of these people died, but have not yet been identified. Russian investigators said the attack was carried out by four shooters using Kalashnikov automatic weapons. More than 500 rounds were found at the scene. The shooting began shortly before the Soviet-era rock group Picnic was set to play to a full house of 6,200 people. More than 200 people could have been in the blazing building moments before the roof collapsed, Baza reported on Saturday, citing emergency service sources who reviewed surveillance footage.

        "date": "March 28, 2024 02:43 pm",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Sri Lanka is hopeful it can resolve debt restructuring issues in the second quarter so it can get financing from the International Monetary Fund because external creditors are all engaging positively, according to the South Asian nations junior finance minister. We are looking forward to a positive outcome of discussions taking place in London with Sri Lankas bondholders, Shehan Semasinghe said Thursday on the sidelines of the Boao Forum in the southern Chinese province of Hainan. Unlocking access to the tranche is very important to Sri Lanka, he added. Semasinghe also said Chinese leader Xi Jinping pledged during very productive bilateral discussion this week with Prime Minister Dinesh Gunawardena in Beijing to reinforce links between Sri Lankan authorities and Export Import Bank of China and China Development Bank. Sri Lanka last week secured initial approval for a 337 million payout from the IMF, though more progress on debt restructuring remains key to unlocking the funding. Sri Lanka has to firm up a preliminary debt restructuring agreement with China ExIm and reach an in-principle deal with China Development Bank, the IMF has said. The government also has to enter memorandums of understanding with official creditors, including India and the Paris Club and reach a deal with its bondholders for the IMFs board to approve the next tranche of the 3 billion bailout. Sri Lankan President Ranil Wickremesinghe has said that the nation is seeking relief from payments through 2027. Semasinghe said Sri Lanka plans to introduce a law to carry forward reforms that have helped the nation get through an unprecedented economic crisis and historic debt default in 2022. These will enhance confidence in the Sri Lankan economy and boost confidence among all creditor nations, he said. Source: Bloomberg --Agencies",

        "content": "(Reuters) - The U.S. State Department on Wednesday offered up to 10 million for information on the Blackcat ransomware gang who hit the UnitedHealth Groups tech unit and snarled insurance payments across America. The ALPHV Blackcat ransomware-as-a-service group compromised computer networks of critical infrastructure sectors in the United States and worldwide, the department said in a statement announcing the reward offer. UnitedHealth said last week it was beginning to clear a medical claims backlog of more than 14 billion as it brought its services back online following the cyberattack, which caused wide-ranging disruption starting in late February. UnitedHealths tech unit, Change Healthcare, plays a critical role in processing payments from insurance companies to practitioners, and the outage caused by the cyberattack has in some cases left patients and doctors out of pocket. The toll on the community health centers that serve more than 30 million poor and uninsured patients has been especially harsh. Hackers said earlier this month that UnitedHealth paid a 22 million ransom in a bid to recover its systems, but whether Blackcat honored its end of the bargain has not been made public. Shortly after the hack, the group put a bogus press release on its website falsely claiming it had been seized by law enforcement, giving the impression that they had shut down operations.

        "date": "March 28, 2024 05:43 pm",
        "content": "(Reuters) - The worlds largest refiner, Chinas Sinopec plans to start work on a refinery in Sri Lanka by June, the power minister said on Thursday, advancing a project earmarked as the biggest investment in the crisis-hit island nation. Sri Lanka is looking to attract investment in the battle to stabilise its economy and return to growth following a financial crisis caused by a severe shortfall of dollars in 2022 that led the economy to contract 2.3 last year. Officials of Sinopec Overseas Investment Holding are visiting Colombo for talks with Sri Lankan authorities. The officials indicated that the management of Sinopec has decided to double the capacity of the refinery from the original proposal, the minister, Kanchana Wijesekera, wrote on social media platform X. They intend to sign the agreements for the project and commence work by June 2024. Sri Lankas cabinet approved the project in November, an investment that Wijesekera has earlier tagged at 4.5 billion. China is Sri Lankas biggest two-way lender, with its companies building highways, sea and air ports and other infrastructure on the island off Indias southern coast. The investment by Sinopec, one of the largest producers of petrochemicals, is part of an effort to expand beyond China, in which it has acquired refinery assets in Saudi Arabia and petrochemicals production in Russia. Iran built Sri Lankas only refinery at Sapugaskanda in the western region in 1969. It can process 38,000 barrels of crude a day. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "content": "The Development Lotteries Board (DLB) has recorded its highest-ever profit of Rs. 3.6 billion in 2023 and a significant portion of Rs. 3.6 billion goes to the Presidents Fund, the Presidents Media Division said. In 2023, the Development Lotteries Board (DLB) achieved its highest-ever profit in its 40-year history. This marked a significant milestone as the DLB recorded a profit margin of 32 for the fiscal year 2022-2023, double the previous years figure, the PMD said a statement. Consequently, contributions to both the Presidents Fund and the government saw notable increases, with a 13 rise for the former, surpassing the target, and a 6 increase for the latter. Mr. Ajith Gunaratne Narangala, Chairman and CEO of the Development Lotteries Board, attributed this success to strategic measures aimed at mitigating the countrys economic challenges, with special guidance from President Ranil Wickremesinghe, who also serves as the Minister of Finance. The chairman mentioned that measures have been implemented to boost the prize money for both regular and newly introduced special lottery tickets of the Development Lotteries Board. Additionally, the board has initiated the introduction of lottery tickets via digital technology, aiming to provide consumers in the country with a novel experience. Notably, a percentage of the proceeds are earmarked for education and healthcare initiatives within the country. --PMD",

        "content": "The Maligakanda Magistrates Court has ordered former President Maithripala Sirisena to make a statement in court on 04 April on his recent comments over the Easter Sunday bomb attacks. The order was issued today (28) after the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) had reported the relevant facts to the court, on the instructions of the Attorney General. Sirisena had recorded a statement for around five-hours with the CID on Monday (05) over his recent comments regarding the Easter Sunday bomb attacks. The CID had summoned the former President in order to record a statement over the controversial statement he recently made on the Easter Sunday attacks, after Minister of Public Security Tiran Alles had instructed the IGP to carry out an investigation into Sirisenas remarks. On Friday (22), former President Maithripala Sirisena had stirred controversy when he claimed he was aware of the true masterminds of the 2019 Easter Sunday terror attacks and that he was prepared to disclose the information to the judiciary if inquired from him or if an order is issued regarding the matter. Speaking to the media in Kandy, Sirisena had claimed that he is ready to disclose the relevant information and that at the same time, it is the responsibility of the judges to keep the information strictly confidential. The comments sparked controversy in the political arena with some accusing the former President of allegedly willfully concealing crucial information about the heinous bombings that claimed the lives of more than 250 people. Amidst the controversy, however former President Sirisena had later claimed that his statement was based on certain information he had received three weeks ago.",

        "content": "Amidst growing pressure to amend its travel advice to Sri Lanka which was deemed overly harsh, the United Kingdom (UK) has defended its decision and said it would continue to keep the island nations travel advise under close review. UKs Minister of State for the Middle East, South Asia, Commonwealth Lord Tariq Ahmad of Wimbledon made this remark in the UK Parliament responding to a question raised on plans to update the travel advice to Sri Lanka to reflect the security situation in the country. He defended the move, saying that the safety of British people is the main factor when determining UKs travel advice for all countries, including Sri Lanka. Our advice is designed to help British people make informed decisions about foreign travel and remains under constant review to ensure it reflects our latest assessment of risks when travelling abroad. Our travel advice is based on objective assessments of the risks to British nationals. These assessments are made by drawing on expert sources of information available to the government including local knowledge from our embassies and information provided by the local authorities in each country. Earlier this year, leading tourism providers including the Experience Travel Group published an open letter with 35 signatories calling for FCDO advice on Sri Lanka to be amended. It criticized the mentioning of fuel and food shortages in the country dating back to the 2022 political unrest and continued references to the 2019 terrorist attacks and said the UK the government was systematically undermining the travel industry in Sri Lanka.",

        "content": "(Reuters) - Sri Lanka has called for proposals from dealer managers to support its restructuring of some 12 billion of international bonds, the Finance Ministry said on Thursday, in a fresh sign that the island nation is closing in on finalizing its debt rework. Sri Lanka defaulted on its foreign debt in May 2022 as the economy sank into its deepest financial crisis in decades due to a severe shortfall of dollars. The government was expected to start formal restructuring talks with bondholders this week. In the context of the restructuring of its International Sovereign Bonds (ISBs), the Government of Sri Lanka is working towards launching an invitation to exchange its existing ISBs denominated in United States Dollars for new ISBs in the same currency, the notice posted on the Finance Ministrys website said. An exchange proposal - an offer by an issuer to repurchase its outstanding bonds in exchange for new bonds with different terms as part of a debt restructuring - is usually launched once an agreement in principle has been reached between the creditor and a group of core bondholders. Proposals have to be submitted by April 10. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "date": "March 28, 2024 10:52 pm",
        "content": "Sri Lankas Prime Minister Dinesh Gunawardena on Thursday called upon the Asian countries to rededicate themselves to building an Asia, free from poverty where prosperity is equitably shared. Addressing the BOAO Forum for Asia Annual Conference 2024 in Hainan in China, he praised Chinas miraculous success story of lifting millions of people from poverty to a higher living standard under the able leadership of President Xi Jinping, and added that concept provides a pathway for other countries faced with the problem of poverty. The Prime Minister called for new initiatives to ensure agricultural growth and food security, as it would not only ensure poverty eradication but also social harmony and peace. He emphasised the imperative need for harnessing renewable energy resources. Explaining Sri Lankas expansion of Colombo Port, and Hambantota Port as well as Colombo Port City, of which new Colombo Financial Center, he said it could be a major financial hub ensuring rapid progress of not only Sri Lanka but also the countries in the region. Addressing the conference the Prime Minister commented as follows: For us from Sri Lanka, we take this special opportunity to participate in an international event that looks to the future, an international event that accepts the reality of climate change, the wants of renewable energy, and to work together within the Asian borders but working together with all nations around the world. Firstly, I would like to thank President Xi Jinping, who has given him tremendous strength in the strong economy that grows and the leadership that has dedicated itself to the economic growth of China. Economic growth of China is economic growth of the world. Economic growth of the world will have to be addressed as we see, as mentioned by the Distinguished speakers of a new order. The new order comes on realities of what we can achieve and what we have achieved. Renewable energy, climate change has to be met, and other changes of a blue economy which are the important areas for the Asian countries. We have to work together in order to achieve these and succeed. From Sri Lanka, we have been participating in these programs that have been initiated and supported by our fellow leaders, countries across Asia. I would like to take one example of a success story that we all could carry together and carry to implement in order to reach better standards of living. The experiment, though it has been called a success story of bringing millions of Chinese people from poverty to better and high living standards, we all face issues of poverty. We all have faced issues of improving our agricultural produce in order to achieve food security. The miracle rice that has been produced in China today can increase production, higher levels of income for the farmers, as well as guarantee a strong future for our food security problems. I raise these two issues because over the years, over the decades, over the centuries, population has faced the challenges of food security, security of better environment and aspirations in order to achieve it. Today, we all know the BOAO conference represents the countries that produce almost 50 of the new investment that has flowed into renewable energy. Mr. Chairman, it is a promise for the future. It is a great trust that has been laid by the BOAO conference, countries that have joined to take forward the responsibility of sharing the future that can be on a trusted basis and targets that we can reach. With this, I would like to thank all the delegates who carried this message from today, once again, to our areas. Relax trade barriers, open areas for more tourism of different forms of tourism, new requirements on emissions, new plans and programs for renewable energy. These can take our planet to a future that is more secure and confident. With these few words, on behalf of Sri Lanka, I pledge our support to continue to work together as we have committed ourselves to the maritime lanes of the Indian Ocean to keep it free for all trade to flow from West East Africa to East of Asia. Sri Lankas port development has taken a new turn of an advanced port development with the assistance of China, for which we appreciate. Sri Lankan, Colombo port will become a hub of a new developed port with financial instruments that could cater to the new demands that are growing among ourselves, among our countries, for development and investment, which is essential. This will change the present scenario from East Asia to East Africa, and the blue seas that we all could work together for the future that we face in a successful and a great joint program is what we look forward to.

        "date": "March 29, 2024 08:44 am",
        "content": "An online platform was launched on Thursday (28), enabling the swift removal of websites, photos, and videos containing or potentially containing instances of child sexual abuse at the Presidential Secretariat under the patronage of President Ranil Wickremesinghe. Recognizing the urgency of addressing child abuse in cyberspace, this initiative targets the dissemination of nude photos and indecent videos of children through the internet and social media channels. Implemented by the National Child Protection Authority (NCPA) in collaboration with the Internet Watch Foundation (IWF), renowned for its expertise in internet child safety enforcement, this program receives financial support from Save the Children and Child Fund. Following the implementation of this online system, individuals can now visit the website of the National Child Protection Authority at www.childprotection.gov.lk to report incidents of indecent photos and videos of children exchanged online. These reports will be handled by the Internet Watch Foundation (IWF), a UK-based global charity working to hunt down and remove videos and images of child sexual abuse shared online, in collaboration with the NCPA. Subsequently, the offending videos will be promptly removed from the internet, and legal action will be pursued against the perpetrators. Addressing the event, President Ranil Wickremesinghe remarked; For several decades, this sector has been neglected. The government has indeed neglected it, and the attention it warranted has not been provided. The magnitude of the problem now is such that resolving it within a year seems implausible. We lack the capacity to address the issue comprehensively; therefore, we must employ a variety of strategies. Firstly, short-term recommendations must be promptly implemented. We propose that the existing committee include stakeholders from the government, specifically authorities in child care and probation services, along with representatives from the Ministry of Education, Ministry of Health, and the police force. Strengthening police numbers, particularly in women and childrens desks at every police station, is imperative. This effort must be coordinated with measures against drugs. Additionally, we must consider establishing a new structure and enacting new legislation. I advocate for the formation of a Childrens Council to oversee both the promotion of childrens interests and their protection. The management of probation and child care services should be devolved to the nine provinces, as I believe this responsibility does not necessarily belong to the central government. He added that immediate action should be taken on short-term recommendations, while the process of enacting new legislation pertaining to childrens rights should also be expedited. For further information, contact the Law Enforcement Division at 011-2778911 extension (269) or visit the official website www.childprotection.gov.lk. The launch of this online initiative was attended by Minister of State for Women and Child Affairs and Social Empowerment, Ms Geeta Kumarasinghe, Chairman of the National Child Protection Authority, Senior Lecturer Mr Udayakumara Amarasinghe, Secretary of the Ministry of Women and Child Affairs and Social Empowerment, Ms Yamuna Perera, and representatives from various organizations dedicated to ensuring child safety.",

        "date": "March 29, 2024 09:53 am",
        "content": "Good Friday is a significant Christian and Catholic religious observance that marks the crucifixion of Jesus Christ and his death at Calvary. This year, Good Friday is commemorated today (29). According to the New Testament, Jesus Christ was crucified on a Friday. As such, Good Friday is observed on the Friday preceding Easter Sunday which marks the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead on the third day of his burial. In the Christian Liturgical Calendar, Easter follows Lent, the 40-day period (excluding Sundays) before Easter which traditionally is observed by acts of penance and fasting. Easter Sunday is immediately preceded by Holy Week (Passion Week) which begins with Palm Sunday, the day Jesus Christ entered the city of Jerusalem. The week continues with Holy Thursday and it marks the Last supper of Jesus Christ, during which he established the sacrament of Holy Communion prior to being arrest. Good Friday is a solemn day of fasting and penance inviting devotees to reflect on the sacrifice made by Jesus Christ to save the humanity. On this day, many churches mediate on the events leading up to the death of Jesus Christ. After Good Friday comes Holy Saturday, which marks the transition between crucifixion and resurrection. Easter Sunday  also known as Resurrection Day  celebrates the resurrection of Jesus Christ. Easter takes place three days after Jesuss death on Good Friday. This holiday concludes the Passion of Christ series of holidays that began with Ash Wednesday. As Sri Lanka is still reeling from the devastating suicide bombings that claimed the lives of more than 250 people and injured hundreds of others on 2019 Easter Sunday, the police have decided to implement a special security plan at all churches across the island. Accordingly, the police, together with the priests and boards of trustees of churches have prepared security plans tailored to each church while the Holy Masses are in progress from 29 - 31 March. As such, a total of 6,837 police personnel, 464 Special Task Force (STF) personnel and 2,882 Tri-Forces personnel have been dispatched to the churches island-wide to implement the security arrangements. Under this security plan, the church premises are inspected before the commencement of the sermons and body searchers will be conducted, if deemed necessary. Special attention is given to churches that attract crowds in large numbers.",

        "title": "Fallen Crypto King Sam Bankman-Fried gets 25 years for fraud",
        "date": "March 29, 2024 11:56 am",
        "content": "Sam Bankman-Fried, co-founder of the failed crypto exchange FTX, has been sentenced to 25 years in prison for defrauding customers and investors of his now-bankrupt firm. The ruling cements the downfall of the former billionaire, who emerged as a high profile champion of crypto before his firms dramatic collapse in 2022. He was found to have stolen billions from customers ahead of the failure. Bankman-Frieds legal team will appeal against his conviction. A message from his parents shared with the BBC by a representative for Bankman-Fried said: We are heartbroken and will continue to fight for our son. Earlier, the 32-year-old said in court he knew a lot of people felt really let down. Im sorry about that. Im sorry about what happened at every stage, he said, speaking quietly and clearly ahead of his sentencing. FTX was one of the worlds largest crypto exchanges before its demise, turning Bankman-Fried into a business celebrity and attracting millions of customers who used the platform to buy and trade cryptocurrency. Rumours of financial trouble sparked a run on deposits in 2022, precipitating the firms implosion and exposing Bankman-Frieds crimes. He was convicted by a New York jury last year on charges including wire fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering, after a trial that detailed how he had taken more than 8bn (6.3bn) from customers, and used the money to buy property, make political donations and put toward other investments. Before reading the sentence on Thursday, Judge Lewis Kaplan provided a harsh assessment of Bankman-Frieds behaviour, saying he had lied during his testimony at trial when he claimed he was unaware until the last minute that his companies were taking money entrusted to them for safe-keeping by customers and using it for other purposes. He knew it was wrong. He knew it was criminal. He regrets that he made a very bad bet about the likelihood of getting caught but hes not going to admit a thing, the judge said. Though Bankman-Fried had made protestations of sorrow about customer losses, he had uttered never a word of remorse for the commission of terrible crimes, he added. While 25 years constitutes a serious prison sentence, it is far less than the more than 100 years Bankman-Fried could have received under official government guidelines. Federal prosecutors in New York this month told the judge such a long term was not necessary. But they requested at least 40 years, arguing that Bankman-Fried had committed a massive fraud, while showing brazen disrespect for the law. Bankman-Frieds team had argued for a lighter sentence of roughly five to 6.5 years. They said that he was a non-violent, first-time offender, and pointed to mental health struggles and argued that customers were poised to recover significant sums under a plan currently working through bankruptcy court. The victims want their money back and they should get it, his lawyer, Marc Mukasey, argued in court on Thursday morning. Sentence him to work hard and give it all away. Former federal prosecutor Mitchell Epner, now a lawyer at Rottenberg Lipman Rich, said he was very surprised by the ruling, noting that Bankman-Fried could potentially be released from prison in about 13 years. But Jennifer Taub, a law professor at Western New England University and expert on white-collar crime, said she thought the length of the sentence was appropriate. It is the right balance between how old he is and what is the purpose of deterrence, she said. In his sentencing remarks, Judge Kaplan said what could amount to a life sentence was unnecessary but that Bankman-Fried must receive a punishment sufficient to prevent him from committing future crimes. There is a risk that this man will be in a position to do something very bad in the future and its not a trivial risk, not a trivial risk at all, he said. He also ordered Bankman-Fried to forfeit 11bn that can be used to compensate victims. The government has already seized some of those assets, such as shares Bankman-Fried owned in Robinhood, the trading app which raised more than 600m when they were sold last year. Bankman-Fried showed little visible reaction to the ruling. Bankman-Fried has admitted to mistakes of mismanagement, but maintained that he was acting in good faith. In his comments ahead of the sentencing, he stuck to his story that FTX had the holdings to repay customers at the time of its collapse and said he did not think that reasons behind customer suffering had been properly told. Theyve been failed by more people than I can count including himself, he said, speaking of the exchanges customers. Its been excruciating to watch. Bankman-Fried said he was sorry for disappointing not only customers but also former employees, including top lieutenants Caroline Ellison and Gary Wang, formerly close friends who testified against him at trial and whom he praised in his remarks. They all built something really beautiful, they threw themselves into it and then I threw it all away, he added. It haunts me every day. Dozens of people, including former FTX customers, family, friends of his parents and complete strangers, had submitted letters to the court, trying to sway the outcome. Louis Dorigny of California, who had been an FTX customer said it was a bittersweet moment for creditors. I dont wish jail time on anybody, and 25 years is a very, very long time to be in prison, but it does nothing to compensate the victims for the loss of their cryptocurrency, he said. Samuel Hapak, chief executive of crypto trading fund Wincent, whose firm represented 200 investors with millions of dollars at FTX when it entered bankruptcy, told the BBC that he thought the ruling was fair. Twenty-five years is a lot and I believe that this sounds like a reasonable signal to the industry that it needs to step up the game, he said. Judge Kaplan said he would not recommend Bankman-Fried serve his sentence in a maximum security prison because the court had no reason to believe he posed a threat of violence. He said he was also taking into account concerns raised by his lawyers and parents that Bankman-Frieds social awkwardness stemming from autism spectrum disorder would make him vulnerable in prison. Bankman-Frieds case has been closely watched by other crypto executives and firms facing charges. But he is not the first player in the industry to be sentenced. Karl Sebastian Greenwood, who worked with Cryptoqueen Ruja Ignatova, was sentenced to 20 years in prison last year for his role convincing millions of people to invest more than 4bn in a fraudulent currency, OneCoin. His case also drew comparisons to Bernie Madoff, who was setenced to 150 years in prison after being found guilty of a 64bn Ponzi scheme. Former federal prosecutor Marc Litt, who worked on the case against Madoff and is now a lawyer at Wachtel Missry, said he saw big differences between the two fraudsters, noting Madoff was older when sentenced, had committed his crimes over several decades, stolen from people he knew well and had no one step forward to testify to his character. The court implicitly took those sorts of differences into consideration and I believe that the resulting lower sentence was both warranted and is unlikely to be disturbed on appeal, he said.

        "content": "British-American filmmaker Christopher Nolan, fresh from his Oscar victory for historical drama Oppenheimer, will receive a knighthood from Britain for services to film. His wife and film producer Emma Thomas will receive a damehood, the female equivalent of a knighthood, the British government said on Thursday in a list of honours recommended by Prime Minister Rishi Sunak that also included Conservative politicians and tech industry leaders. Oppenheimer, a blockbuster biopic about the race to build the first atomic bomb, claimed seven Academy Awards earlier this month, including the best picture trophy and Nolans first best director Academy Award. His career includes other highly regarded films such as Interstellar, Inception, Dunkirk and the Batman trilogy. Nolan wrote the screenplay for Oppenheimer and produced the film with Thomas. Among others to receive a knighthood were Demis Hassabis, the CEO of Googles DeepMind. Other figures from the world of artificial intelligence who were honoured include Matthew Clifford, an AI adviser to the British government, and entrepreneur Ian Hogarth, chair of the AI Safety Institute, both of whom were bestowed with CBEs (Commander of the Order of the British Empire.) Billionaire businessman and Conservative Party donor Mohamed Mansour was given a knighthood for business, charity and political service. Sunak doled out awards to his Conservative lawmakers, too - with knighthoods for Philip Davies and Mark Spencer and damehoods for Tracey Crouch and Harriett Baldwin. Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos was awarded an honorary CBE for services to creative industries. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "title": "Bunker demand surges in Sri Lankan ports as India grapples with supply shortages",
        "date": "March 29, 2024 12:18 pm",
        "content": "In the wake of vessel re-routings aimed at avoiding the Red Sea, bunker demand across ports in both India and Sri Lanka has witnessed a significant surge, highlighting a growing challenge for the maritime industry. While India contends with supply shortages, Sri Lankan ports are experiencing a notable increase in activity. According to SP Global Commodity Insights, the demand spike, estimated to be over 30 per cent in ports across India and Sri Lanka, has been primarily attributed to longer voyages undertaken by ship owners and charters to circumvent the Red Sea region. Consequently, ports on Indias west coast, particularly Kochi and Mumbai, are grappling with disrupted VLSFO (Very Low Sulfur Fuel Oil) supplies, exacerbating the situation. Despite the increased demand, price movements in the bunker fuel market have been mixed as of March 28. Platts, a division of SP Global Commodity Insights, reported that while 0.5 per cent marine fuel oil delivered to Kochi saw a USD 20mt increase to USD 700mt CFR, prices in Mumbai fell to USD 698mt, down by USD 8mt. Similarly, in Sri Lanka, prices at Colombo were assessed at USD 700mt, reflecting a decrease of USD 7mt on the week. A trader based in Gujarat highlighted the substantial rise in demand, and told SP Global, Demand has substantially increased, almost by 30 per cent across Mumbai, Kochi and Gujrat ports. Long haul vessels are calling more often now. The volumes that were being lifted at King Abdullah port, Yanbu, Djibouti and Suez Canal have now shifted to Indian and Sri Lankan Ports. Echoing this sentiment, a supplier based in Kandla noted, Longer voyages coupled with a shortage of VLSFO at some Indian ports has increased demand at Kandla and Mundra. The supply crunch at Indian ports, particularly Kochi, has further bolstered demand at Sri Lankan ports like Colombo and Hambantota. A Bunkerworld survey revealed a significant surge in bunker sales volume at Colombo, reaching 40,000 mtmonth, up from an average of 30,000 mtmonth prior to the disruptions in the Red Sea region. Despite the increased demand, Sri Lankan ports remain well supplied through consistent inflows from Fujairah and Singapore. A supplier from Kochi highlighted the market conditions, stating, For VLSFO the queries have reduced a lot as the market knows were out of product. Whatever prices are being quoted are only on best endeavor basis (subject to availability). He added, With that condition, both traders and clients do not want to take any risk. Were not getting any queries for MGO and even if we do its only for smaller parcels that would help cover the voyage to cheaper places. In response to supply shortages in India, traders have redirected their inquiries to Sri Lanka, further driving up demand in the region. A trader based in Colombo remarked, Demand has almost doubled since January. Tightness across Indian markets during the first few weeks also helped us to capture the demand. Interestingly, were seeing a considerable number of inquiries for HSFO. There are three active high sulfur fuel oil suppliers in the market now. However, supply constraints persist in India, particularly at major ports like Kochi and Mumbai. A BPCL official noted the impact of disrupted cargo inflows on VLSFO production, stating, Kochi remains dry. BPCL does not buy spot purchases, we might have been getting sweet crude cargoes from Mediterranean, but the crisis has disrupted cargo inflows and thus the production of VLSFO has been hit. Meanwhile, an IOCL official shed light on the challenges faced by refineries, stating, The IOCL refinery in Gujarat underwent a partial shutdown in February while the demand surged due to the Red Sea. Initially, the refinery was producing in line with market demand. He added, However, we found ourselves actively pursuing traders to understand why demand wasnt picking up at Kandla port, when demand was low at the time. Consequently, we slightly reduced production. With the spotlight on Indias bunker fuel production, its revealed that the entire production comes from only three refineries, out of which HPCL and BPCL have lowered output. In Haldia, while demand remains high, supply falls short of requirements due to maintenance issues at the local refinery. The top suppliers of bunker fuels in the Indian market, including IOCL, BPCL, and HPCL, continue to navigate challenges to meet the escalating demand. Source: ANI --Agencies",

        "title": "UN top court orders Israel to open more land crossings for aid into Gaza",
        "date": "March 29, 2024 03:38 pm",
        "content": "The top United Nations court on Thursday ordered Israel to take measures to improve the humanitarian situation in Gaza, including opening more land crossings to allow food, water, fuel and other supplies into the war-ravaged enclave. The International Court of Justice issued two new so-called provisional measures in a case brought by South Africa accusing Israel of acts of genocide in its military campaign launched after the Oct. 7 attacks by Hamas. Israel denies it is committing genocide and accused South Africa of trying to undermine Israels inherent right and obligation to defend its citizens. Thursdays order came after South Africa sought more provisional measures, including a cease-fire, citing starvation in Gaza. Israel, which had urged the court not to issue new orders, said it places no limits on aid entering Gaza and vowed to promote new initiatives to bring in even more assistance. In its legally binding order, the court told Israel to take measures without delay to ensure the unhindered provision of basic services and humanitarian assistance, including food, water, fuel and medical supplies. It also ordered Israel to immediately ensure that its military does not take action that could that could harm Palestinians rights under the Genocide Convention, including by preventing the delivery of humanitarian assistance. The court told Israel to report back in a month on its implementation of the orders. Israel declared war in response to a bloody cross-border attack by Hamas on Oct. 7 in which 1,200 people were killed and 250 others were taken hostage. Israel responded with a campaign of airstrikes and a ground offensive that have left over 32,000 Palestinians dead, according to local health authorities. The Health Ministry in Hamas-run Gaza does not differentiate between civilians and combatants, but say roughly two-thirds of the dead are women, children and teens. Israel says over one-third of the dead are militants, though it has not provided evidence to support the claim, and it blames Hamas for civilian casualties because the group operates in residential areas. The fighting has displaced over 80 of Gazas population, caused widespread damage and has sparked a humanitarian crisis. The U.N. and international aid agencies say virtually the entire Gaza population is struggling to get enough food, with hundreds of thousands of people on the brink of famine, especially in hard-hit northern Gaza. South Africa welcomed Thursdays decision, calling it significant. The fact that Palestinian deaths are not solely caused by bombardment and ground attacks, but also by disease and starvation, indicates a need to protect the groups right to exist, the South African president said in a statement. Hamas, an Islamic militant group sworn to Israels destruction, said the ruling must be enforced by the international community. It must be implemented immediately, so that this decision does not remain a dead letter, it said. The Palestinian Foreign Ministry thanked South Africa, calling the case a vital step in the global effort to hold Israel accountable for perpetrating genocide. After initially sealing Gazas borders in the early days of the war, Israel began to permit entry of humanitarian supplies. It says it places no restrictions on the amount of humanitarian aid allowed into Gaza and accuses the United Nations of failing to properly organize the deliveries. On Tuesday, the army said it inspected 258 aid trucks, but only 116 were distributed within Gaza by the U.N. The U.N. and international aid groups say deliveries have been impeded by Israeli military restrictions, ongoing hostilities and the breakdown of public order. The Israeli Foreign Ministry accused South Africa of making cynical attempts to exploit the world court to undermine Israels right to self-defense and to win the release of remaining hostages. Israel says Hamas continues to hold some 100 hostages and the remains of 30 others either killed on Oct. 7 or who died in captivity. Israel will continue to promote new initiatives, and to expand existing ones, in order to enable and facilitate the flow of aid to the Gaza Strip ... despite the operational challenges on the ground and Hamas active and abhorrent efforts to commandeer, hoard and steal aid, it added. Israel has been working with international partners on a plan to soon begin deliveries of aid by sea. Israel has repeatedly feuded with the United Nations, particularly UNRWA, the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees and main provider of aid in Gaza. Israel accuses the agency of tolerating and even cooperating with Hamas  a charge UNRWA denies. The court said in its order that Palestinians in Gaza are no longer facing only a risk of famine ... but that famine is setting in. It cited a report from the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs that said at least 31 people, including 27 children, have already died of malnutrition and dehydration. The world court said earlier orders imposed on Israel after landmark hearings in South Africas case do not fully address the consequences arising from the changes in the situation in Gaza. COGAT, the Israeli military body in charge of Palestinian civilian affairs, has also run pilot programs to inspect the humanitarian aid at Israels main checkpoints in the south and then use land crossings in central Gaza to try to bring aid to the devastated northern part of the Strip. The agency had no immediate comment on the ICJ ruling. Source: Associated Press -Agencies",

The delegation comprised MPs Ranjith Madduma Bandara, Ashok Abeysinghe, Sumith Udukumbura, Manjula Dissanayake, as well as Secretary General of Parliament Kushani Rohanadeera. Addressing the General Debate under the theme Parliamentary diplomacy: Building bridges for peace and understanding Abeywardena has pointed out that parliamentary diplomacy acts as a bridge between governments and citizens, ensuring that the concerns and perspectives of the people are taken into account in the formulation of foreign policies. The Sri Lankan Speaker has also stated that in recent times, parliamentary diplomacy has gained prominence as a tool for conflict prevention and resolution. By facilitating dialogue and understanding between nations at the legislative level, parliamentary diplomats contribute to creating an environment conducive to peaceful coexistence, he added. The Speaker has further mentioned that, parliamentary diplomacy is an important perspective and alternative form of diplomacy. Even if not widely studied yet, parliamentary diplomacy has developed lately by the increasing role of Parliaments and their enrolment in foreign affairs and issues related to international relations. Focusing on the experiences of the Parliament of Sri Lanka, the Speaker has pointed out that Sri Lanka joined Inter-Parliamentary Union on 9th Feb 1949. Since then, Sri Lanka actively participated in IPU assemblies and Sri Lanka had the opportunity to host several seminars and workshops of IPU in the past, the speaker added. Further, the Sectoral Oversight Committee on International Relations and Consultative Committee on Ministry of Foreign Affairs have wide mandates to inquire into all aspects of foreign policy, to examine legislation referred to them as well as the expenditure estimates of departments and agencies that are implementing foreign policy, Abeywardena has said further in his address. During the assembly, the Sri Lankan lawmakers attended the Standing Committee on Democracy and Human Rights, Standing Committee on Peace and International Security, Standing Committee on Sustainable Development and Forum of Women Parliamentarians and shared their experiences and knowledge.",

        "title": "Cocoa prices rise to fresh records: Will we run out of chocolate?",
        "date": "March 29, 2024 06:24 pm",
        "content": "Cocoa prices briefly surged to all-time highs on Tuesday, touching over 10,000 (9,234.3) per ton, before settling back at 9,622 per ton on Wednesday morning, following disappointing harvests in key cocoa-producing countries such as Ghana and Ivory Coast. Cameroon, another cocoa-producing nation, has also been seeing much of the same conditions. The crop also saw a 19.8 gain in the past week, as well as a 42.4 rise this month. In the past year, cocoa prices have jumped about 231. Cocoa is widely used in a number of chocolate products and confectioneries, with by-products such as cocoa nibs, cocoa butter, cocoa pod husks and pulp also being used for soft drinks, alcohol, vinegar, cosmetics, health supplements, fragrances and more. However, due to chocolate being by far the most common cocoa product, the rising cocoa prices have led to more worries about higher chocolate prices, as well as a chocolate shortage. Why are cocoa prices rising? Cocoa prices have been rapidly increasing for the last few months due to worse-than-expected harvests from in Western African countries such as Ghana and Ivory Coast, squeezing cocoa supplies worldwide. This is mainly due to the weather phenomenon El Nino, which caused unseasonably heavy rainfall in December last year, resulting in black pod disease widely damaging crops. A combination of climate change and the continuation of El Nino also led to extreme heat in the following months, further disrupting harvests. El Nino particularly impacts cocoa and other crops by exacerbating dry, dusty winds from the Sahara desert, which impact the crops access to sunlight. Since cocoa is an especially drought-sensitive crop, this harsher, dryer weather can be particularly debilitating for harvests. Ageing cocoa trees also contributed to lower harvests, as they are more susceptible to disease. This also means that they are more expensive to maintain, with several farmers choosing to abandon old cocoa trees and farms, for greener pastures. Illegal mining in West African regions has also increased drastically, due to the rich deposits of metals and minerals such as gold, uranium, iron ore and diamonds, amongst others. This has led to a massive loss of arable land, due to deforestation, as well as declining water body quality. Rising cocoa prices do not seem to be translating into gains for cocoa farmers, who are still struggling considerably with increased production costs and reduced crop yields. As such, several farmers have also chosen to sell their cocoa farms and lands to mining companies. What does this mean for chocolate manufacturers? Several cocoa plants in Ghana and Ivory Coast have reportedly decreased or stopped cocoa processing activities due to the beans becoming too expensive to procure. Furthermore, the Ivory Coast cocoa regulator has also revealed that it expects the countrys mid-crop, starting in April to drop approximately 33 to about 400,000 metric tons. If so, this would be quite a step down from last years 600,000 metric tons. Similarly, Ghana has also announced that its cocoa production forecast is now expected to be about 650,000 tons, down from 850,000 tons for this year. Chocolate maker Hersheys has already warned that record high cocoa prices were likely to impact earnings growth this year. Hersheys chief executive officer Michele Buck said in an analyst call, as reported by BBC, We cant talk about future pricing, but given where cocoa prices are, we will be using every tool in our toolbox, including pricing, as a way to manage the business. Mondolez, the owner of Cadbury, Oreo and Toblerone, also hiked chocolate prices by up to 15 in 2023, and has indicated that it is likely to continue doing so to achieve its revenue forecasts for this year. The company also highlighted rising sugar prices as one of the key challenges for the upcoming year, along with cocoa prices. The companys chief financial officer, Luca Zaramella, said: Pricing is clearly a key component of this plan. Its contribution will be a little bit less than we have seen in 2023, but it is higher than an average year, as reported by AP. Easter sales likely to bring a silver lining for chocolate makers Upcoming Easter chocolate sales are likely to ease chocolate maker concerns for the short-term at least, with several manufacturers already having raised the prices of Easter eggs and bunnies. Consumer services and research company which revealed that brands such as Toblerone and Lindt have already hiked prices for their popular chocolate bunnies and eggs by about 50, compared to 2023. The sizes of several sweet treats have also decreased, as manufacturers continue to find ways to cut corners. Several manufacturers, such as Hersheys, are also pushing the sales of non-cocoa products, such as their cookies and cream range, as well as gummy bears and other candy, to make up for the higher chocolate prices. However, this year, consumers may very well also be a little more cautious when it comes to holiday and non-essential spending, due to the ongoing cost of living crisis. This may potentially put a cap on Easter sales, as consumers shop more mindfully and hunt for better bargains. Source: Euro News --Agencies",

        "date": "March 29, 2024 07:18 pm",
        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe expressed his aspirations for Sri Lanka to reclaim its position as the champion of cricket, highlighting the governments commitment to providing all necessary support to achieve this goal. Speaking at the 125th anniversary celebration of the Sinhalese Sports Club (SSC) at the Shangri-La Hotel Colombo yesterday (28), the President emphasized the importance of maintaining a separation between politics and sports. He suggested that preventing politicians from assuming high positions in sports clubs could contribute to a healthier sporting environment. During the celebration, a commemorative book documenting the 125-year history of the Sinhalese Sports Club was unveiled, accompanied by the release of a postage stamp and a first-day cover. President Ranil Wickremesinghe took the opportunity to commend SSC players who had represented Sri Lanka in international cricket, expressing appreciation for their contributions. The President also joined in a group photograph with the players, symbolizing unity and camaraderie within the sporting community. Addressing the gathering, President Ranil Wickremesinghe underscored the enduring bonds between esteemed educational institutions such as Royal, St. Thomas, Wesley and the Sinhalese Sports Club. He noted that individuals who have pursued cricket from these schools have established a shared identity with the Sinhalese Sports Club. Drawing from personal history, President Wickremesinghe shared anecdotes about his own familys association with the club. He mentioned his great-grandfather Meedeniya Adigar and grandfather C.L. Wickremesinghe, both of whom had joined the SSC as a means to embrace and promote a unified Sri Lankan identity. Following their footsteps, President Wickremesinghe revealed that his father had also become a member of the club after the country gained independence. The President reflected on the historical context of the formation of sports clubs during a bygone era, highlighting their significance in fostering a sense of collective identity among different ethnic communities in Sri Lanka. He noted that clubs such as the Tamil Union and those established by the Malays served as platforms for various groups to assert their cultural and linguistic identity, rather than being rooted in ethnic strife or competition. Emphasizing the inclusive nature of these clubs, President Ranil Wickremesinghe remarked that they were not defined by religious or caste divisions, but rather by shared language and culture. He underscored how these clubs facilitated the coming together of Sinhalese, Tamils and Malays, ultimately contributing to the development of a common national identity. President Wickremesinghe also acknowledged the esteemed leaders of his party who had served as presidents of the Sinhalese Sports Club, including former Prime Minister D.S. Senanayake and former President J.R. Jayewardene. He expressed gratitude for their contributions and the honour it bestowed upon the party. While he himself had been a member of the sports club, the President revealed that he had chosen to step back from active involvement as a politician, recognizing the evolving nature of contemporary politics compared to the eras of Mr. D. S. Senanayake and Mr. J.R. Jayewardene. President Wickremesinghe articulated his belief in the importance of maintaining a clear distinction between politics and sports, advocating for the exclusion of politicians from high-ranking positions within sports clubs. He emphasized the necessity of preserving the integrity and independence of sports from political influence, recognizing that this separation would contribute to a healthier sporting environment. However, the President clarified that this stance did not signify a disengagement from sports. On the contrary, he assured the audience of his continued commitment to supporting sports initiatives and meeting the needs of athletes and sports enthusiasts. Acknowledging the significance of upholding the traditions established by past leaders, he underscored the importance of nurturing and advancing sporting activities in the country. To demonstrate his commitment to fostering sports development, President Ranil Wickremesinghe revealed that he has instructed the Minister of Sports to present a Memorandum to the Cabinet, with a proposal to provide the land belonging to the Sinhala Sports Club on a 99-year lease basis, thereby ensuring the continuity and sustainability of the clubs operations and activities. President Wickremesinghe underscored the importance of advancing Sri Lankan cricket, expressing his ambition to witness the nation reclaim its championship status in the sport. He highlighted that the government has earmarked One billion rupees for cricket development this year, with plans for additional funding in the following year. This substantial investment will be managed by a trust overseen by Sidath Wettamuni, a distinguished cricketer and a member of the SSC. The funds will be utilized to enhance cricket programs in rural schools, organize cricket matches and foster the growth of cricket at the grassroots level. The President emphasized the importance of expanding cricket programs in 1000-1500 schools, aiming to cultivate a vast talent pool from which the national team can be selected. Additionally, concerted efforts have been made to elevate the standard of cricket across the country. In this regard, both the Cricket Board and sports clubs play a pivotal role. Furthermore, the President expressed gratitude to the Sinhala Sports Club for its significant contribution to cricket in Sri Lanka, urging collective action to propel the nation towards global leadership in the sport. Professor Maithree Wickramasinghe, Minister of Tourism, Lands, Sports and Youth Affairs Harin Fernando, along with notable figures such as Chairman of Sri Lanka Cricket Association Shammi Silva, Chairman of Sinhalese Sports Club Indunil De Silva, Secretary Wasantha Wijesekera, Treasurer Nilanka Peiris and members of the executive committee of the Sinhalese Sports Club graced the occasion. The event also saw the presence of former presidents, distinguished past and present cricketers, including former captain of the England cricket team Nasser Hussain and ICC referee Ranjan Madugalle, among other esteemed guests. --PMD--",

        "date": "March 29, 2024 09:27 pm",
        "content": "A Filipino villager has been nailed to a wooden cross for the 35th time to reenact Jesus Christs suffering in a brutal Good Friday tradition he said he would devote to pray for peace in Ukraine, Gaza and the disputed South China Sea. On Friday, over a hundred people watched on as 10 devotees were nailed to wooden crosses, among them Ruben Enaje, a 63-year-old carpenter and sign painter. The real-life crucifixions have become an annual religious spectacle that draws tourists in three rural communities in Pampanga province, north of Manila. The gory ritual resumed last year after a three-year pause due to the coronavirus pandemic. It has turned Enaje into a village celebrity for his role as the Christ in the Lenten reenactment of the Way of the Cross. Ahead of the crucifixions, Enaje told The Associated Press by telephone Thursday night that he has considered ending his annual religious penitence due to his age, but said he could not turn down requests from villagers for him to pray for sick relatives and all other kinds of maladies. The need for prayers has also deepened in an alarming period of wars and conflicts worldwide, he said. If these wars worsen and spread, more people, especially the young and old, would be affected. These are innocent people who have totally nothing to do with these wars, Enaje said. Despite the distance, the wars in Ukraine and Gaza have helped send prices of oil, gas and food soaring elsewhere, including in the Philippines, making it harder for poor people to stretch their meagre income, he said. Closer to home, the escalating territorial dispute between China and the Philippines in the South China Sea has also sparked worries because its obviously a lopsided conflict, Enaje said. China has many big ships. Can you imagine what they could do? he asked. This is why I always pray for peace in the world, he said and added he would also seek relief for people in southern Philippine provinces, which have been hit recently by flooding and earthquakes. In the 1980s, Enaje survived nearly unscathed when he accidentally fell from a three-story building, prompting him to undergo the crucifixion as thanksgiving for what he considered a miracle. He extended the ritual after loved ones recovered from serious illnesses, one after another, and he landed more carpentry and sign-painting job contracts. Because my body is getting weaker, I cant tell  if there will be a next one or if this is really the final time, Enaje said. During the annual crucifixions on a dusty hill in Enajes village of San Pedro Cutud in Pampanga and two other nearby communities, he and other religious devotees, wearing thorny crowns of twigs, carried heavy wooden crosses on their backs for more than a kilometer (more than half a mile) under a hot summer sun. Village actors dressed as Roman centurions hammered 4-inch (10-centimeter) stainless steel nails through their palms and feet, then set them aloft on wooden crosses for about 10 minutes as dark clouds rolled in and a large crowd prayed and snapped pictures. Among the crowd this year was Maciej Kruszewski, a tourist from Poland and a first-time audience member of the crucifixions. Here, we would like to just grasp what does it mean, Easter in completely different part of the world, said Kruszewski. Other penitents walked barefoot through village streets and beat their bare backs with sharp bamboo sticks and pieces of wood. Some participants in the past opened cuts in the penitents backs using broken glass to ensure the ritual was sufficiently bloody. Many of the mostly impoverished penitents undergo the ritual to atone for their sins, pray for the sick or for a better life, and give thanks for miracles. The gruesome spectacle reflects the Philippines unique brand of Catholicism, which merges church traditions with folk superstitions. Church leaders in the Philippines, the largest Catholic nation in Asia, have frowned on the crucifixions and self-flagellations. Filipinos can show their faith and religious devotion, they say, without hurting themselves and by doing charity work instead, such as donating blood, but the tradition has lasted for decades.

        "content": "Prime Minister Dinesh Gunawardena had a long discussion with Gong Seng, Mayor of Shanghai, on Friday (29) in Shanghai, China. It was agreed to establish a strong relationship between Shanghai, China, which is ranked first among the worlds port cities, and the cities of Colombo and Hambantota, which have been planned to be developed as a maritime hub in the East and West shipping routes in the future. A long time has passed since the Sister City Agreement between Colombo and Shanghai was signed, and the Prime Minister pointed out that further work can be carried out under this agreement, which was signed when his brother Prasanna Gunawardena was holding the post of Mayor. It was emphasised that the city of Shanghai has handled 49.5 million containers in terms of cargo transportation, and last year it ranked first in cargo transportation in the world, and there are many lessons that can be learnt by Sri Lanka in the said sector. The Mayor of Shanghai assured that the city of Shanghai, which has an annual production income of 4.72 trillion Yuan, and is also a first class business centre and a centre for financial transactions in the world, will share their experiences with Sri Lanka. The Prime Minister pointed out that huge lessons can be learnt by Sri Lanka from the progress made in the planned urban development of the city of Shanghai, which has a population of 25 million people. The Mayor of Shanghai expressed his agreement to support Sri Lanka in each of those fields and invited the officials of those fields to visit Shanghai and study the said fields. The interest of the Chinese people to travel in Sri Lanka, which has many UNESCO heritage sites, has increased, and it was also agreed to explore the possibility of increasing the flights between Colombo and Shanghai. A group including State Ministers Shehan Semasinghe, Ashoka Priyantha, and Secretary to the Prime Minister Anura Dissanayake participated in this event.",

        "date": "March 29, 2024 11:56 pm",
        "content": "The plight of women in Afghanistan is expected to get worse. The Taliban regime has vowed to start public stoning of women to death, an act that the groups Supreme Leader, Hibatullah Akhundzada, claims is in the name of God. Taliban, who took control of the country in 2021, have already been carrying out public floggings and executions. These brutal punishments are doled out even for crimes like thefts and robberies. Now, Akhundzada, in an audio message, has said that women committing adultery will be stoned to death. In the message, released by the Taliban-run state media, he addresses the West, saying, We will soon implement the punishment for adultery. We will flog women in public. We will stone them to death in public. These are all against your democracy, but we will continue doing it. According to The Telegraph, he compared the West with the Devil and said, We both say we defend human rights  we do it as Gods representative and you as the Devils. He further asserted that the Western notion of womens rights goes against Islamic Sharia law. I told the Mujahideen that we tell the Westerners that we fought against you for 20 years and we will fight 20 and even more years against youIt did not finish when you left. It does not mean we would now just sit and drink tea. We will bring Sharia to this landwe will now bring Sharia into action, Akhundzada said. Under the guise of acting as Gods representatives and implementing the Sharia law, the Taliban have rolled back womens rights and has severely curtailed their educational and employment opportunities. Within weeks of coming into power three years ago, it banned girls and women teachers from secondary education. Around the same time, the Taliban banned women from most workplaces and introduced male guardianship beyond 72 kilometres from their homes. Then, in May 2022, under the Talibans puritanical interpretation of Sharia, women were ordered to cover themselves from head to toe. In November 2023, women were barred from parks and, a month later, womens university education was suspended. Rights groups and advocates blamed the plight of Afghan women on the international communitys silence. Human Rights Watch (HRW) researcher Sahar Fetrat told The Telegraph that the Taliban was emboldened to make such a decision because of the international communitys inaction. The world did not hold Taliban accountable for its curtailment of womens rights over the past two years, she said. Fetrat said that They tested their draconian policies one by one, and have reached this point because there is no one to hold them accountable for the abuses. Through the bodies of Afghan women, the Taliban demand and command moral and societal orders. We should all be warned that if not stopped, more and more will come. Source: Firstpost -Agencies",

        "date": "March 30, 2024 09:13 am",
        "content": "The collapse of a bridge in the US city of Baltimore will result in the largest single marine insurance loss ever, a British insurance marketplace said. Six people were presumed dead after a ship crashed into the bridge, and divers have recovered two bodies. Experts say the damages could cost as much as 3 billion (2.3 billion). I would say its certainly going to be one of the largest marine losses in history, said John Neal, chief executive officer of Lloyds of London. Of that there is little or no doubt, Mr Neal told the BBC. But genuinely the good news is its insured. Mr Neal said the port and the ship that crashed into the bridge are also insured. So from a financial point of view, there is a process that will allow for financial compensation to be made and for the claim to be settled, he said. The Maryland Department of Transportation has so far asked the Biden administration for 60m in emergency funds to help clear debris and clean up after the incident. Addressing the bridge collapse is not the only expense, either. Until the shipping lane is reopened, experts say the incident could lead to losses of up to 15m (11.8m) because of how vital the Baltimore port is to global commerce. Mr Neal would not offer a number for how much insurance companies may be billed for the collision, but analysts at Barclays have said the claims could cost insurance companies as much as 3bn. The analysts said damages to the bridge itself could amount to 1.2bn, while insurance companies may face fees between 350m and 700m for wrongful deaths. Closure of one of the US biggest ports while the bridge is repaired could also cost millions of dollars, Barclays analysts said. The Port of Baltimore is the 14th largest in the US. In 2023, 52.3 million tonnes of foreign cargo, worth 80.8bn, passed through Baltimore, according to data from the state of Maryland. Experts have stressed that the closure of the port could have ripple effects on global supply chains. President Joe Biden has said the federal government should cover the cost to rebuild the bridge. Paul Wiedefeld, secretary of the Maryland Department of Transportation, and other officials noted that resolving the bridge collapse will not be a quick process. But he promised at a press conference on Wednesday that officials were working to come up with a design for the replacement of that bridge as quickly as possible to get the port back up and the community back up and running.

        "content": "China has said it would continue to support Sri Lanka, as the crisis-hit island nations prime minister on Saturday wrapped up a visit to Beijing to try to finalise a debt restructuring deal. Prime Minister Dinesh Gunawardena arrived in China on Monday for a visit that included meeting President Xi Jinping and an appearance at the Boao Forum, a high-profile international meeting. Sri Lankas years-long economic crisis was high on the agenda during Gunawardenas trip, with China accounting for around 10 percent of the South Asian countrys total foreign debt. China is willing to continue supporting its financial institutions to actively negotiate with Sri Lanka, maintain friendly communication with other creditors, play a positive role in the International Monetary Fund, assist Sri Lanka in financial relief, Beijings foreign ministry said in the Chinese version of a joint bilateral statement released Friday. The two sides agreed to make every effort to promote the Port City Colombo and Hambantota Development Project, turning them into flagship projects of the Sino-Sri Lankan joint construction of the Belt and Road, the statement said, referring to Xis massive Belt and Road global infrastructure initiative. The southern sea port of Hambantota was considered among the white-elephant projects launched by former president Mahinda Rajapaksa, who ruled the country for a decade until 2015. Rajapaksa borrowed heavily from China for projects that many criticised as a debt trap that led to the worst economic crisis in Sri Lankas history. Unable to repay a huge loan taken from China in 2017 to build Hambantota port, Sri Lanka handed it over to the state-owned China Merchants Group for 1.12 billion on a 99-year lease. Sri Lanka defaulted on its 46 billion external debt in April 2022 after it ran out of foreign exchange to finance even essential imports such as food, fuel and medicine. It secured a 2.9 billion International Monetary Fund (IMF) bailout last year, with the programme conditional on a debt deal that satisfies foreign creditors. China had agreed in principle to restructure Sri Lankas debt in December, but neither Colombo nor Beijing had given details and the two are yet to finalise an agreement. Sri Lankas government said in January that a foreign debt restructure would be finalised by the beginning of April. Source: AFP --Agencies",

        "content": "The National Audit Office has made recommendations to the Consumer Affairs Authority (CAA) to increase the number of raids on traders selling beyond the Maximum Retail Price (MRP) as well as on importers and wholesalers. This was mentioned in a new report published by the audit office, with respect to the contribution of CAA in protecting the consumer. This audit was conducted to evaluate how the CAA has performed to implement the provisions of the Consumer Affairs Act and achieve the objectives mentioned in the legislation. The audit office has observed that the actual number of raids carried out during the period from 2018 to 2022 was lower than the target number  in the range of 56 to 74. It was also observed that it took more than 2 years to file cases for 3,616 raids out of 3,715 raids carried out from 2018 to 31 December 2021, the report revealed. Further, the audit report also recommended that market raids be conducted and legal action be taken against the importers who do not present information to the Authority to obtain MRP certificates. The CAA is also instructed to physically verify the prices before granting approval for the rates submitted by the importers to obtain MRP certificates. Among the audit offices recommendations are identification of the types of goods that need to be issued with the certification of MRP in relation to the imported goods. Additionally, the report also called for expeditious legal actions against traders and manufacturers in connection with the samples found to be unfit for consumption or not in the prescribed standard during the samples inspection.",

        "title": "IMF confirms increasing Egypts bailout loan to 8 billion",
        "date": "March 30, 2024 11:58 pm",
        "content": "The executive board of the International Monetary Fund confirmed a deal with Egypt to increase its bailout loan from 3 billion to 8 billion, in a move that is meant to shore up the Arab countrys economy which is hit by a staggering shortage of foreign currency and soaring inflation. In a statement late Friday, the board said its decision would enable Egypt to immediately receive about 820 million as part of the deal which was announced earlier this month. The deal was achieved after Egypt agreed with the IMF on a reform plan that is centered on floating the local currency, reducing public investment and allowing the private sector to become the engine of growth, the statement said. Egypt has already floated the pound and sharply increased the main interest rate. Commercial banks are now trading the U.S. currency at more than 47 pounds, up from about 31 pounds. The measures are meant to combat ballooning inflation and attract foreign investment. The Egyptian economy has been hit hard by years of government austerity, the coronavirus pandemic, the fallout from Russias full-scale invasion of Ukraine, and most recently, the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza. The Houthi attacks on shipping routes in the Red Sea have slashed Suez Canal revenues, which is a major source for foreign currency. The attacks forced traffic away from the canal and around the tip of Africa. Egypt is facing significant macroeconomic challenges that have become more complex to manage given the spillovers from the recent conflict in Gaza and Israel. The disruptions in the Red Sea are also reducing Suez Canal receipts, which are an important source of foreign exchange inflows and fiscal revenue, said IMFs Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva. The IMF said such external shocks, combined with delayed reforms, have negatively impacted economic activity. Growth slowed to 3.8 in the fiscal year 2022-23 due to weak confidence and foreign currency shortages, and is projected to slow further to 3 in the fiscal year 2023-24 before recovering to about 4½ percent in 2024-25, the IMF statement said. The annual inflation rate was 36 in February, but is expected to ease over the medium term, the IMF said. The currency devaluation and interest rate hike have inflicted further pain on Egyptians already struggling with skyrocketing prices over the past years. Nearly 30 of Egyptians live in poverty, according to official figures. Finance Minister Mohamed Maait said the confirmation by the IMFs executive board reflects the importance of the correcting measures taken by the government. Egypt also this month signed a deal with the European Union that includes a 7.4 billion-euro (8 billion) aid package for the most populous Arab country over three years. To quickly inject much-needed funds into Egypts staggering economy, the EU intends to fast-track 1 billion euros (1.1 billion) of the package, using an urgent funding procedure that bypasses parliamentary oversight and other safeguards, according to European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.

        "date": "March 31, 2024 09:52 am",
        "content": "China will play a positive role in easing the financial difficulties of cash-strapped Sri Lanka and its bid to achieve debt sustainability while Colombo will accelerate the formulation of a BRI cooperation plan to advance Beijings projects in the island nation, a joint statement said on Sunday. As Sri Lankan Prime Minister Dinesh Gunawardena wrapped up his official weeklong visit to China, the joint statement brought out the highlights of the agreements discussed during his talks with Chinese President Xi Jinping and Premier Li Qiang besides attending the Boao Forum for Asia Annual Conference. The Chinese side expresses its readiness to continue supporting its financial institution in actively consulting with Sri Lanka, maintain friendly communication with other creditors, and play a positive role in the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to help Sri Lanka ease its financial difficulties and achieve debt sustainability, the joint statement said. During Gunawardenas visit, both countries agreed to work together to deepen high-quality Belt and Road cooperation, accelerate the formulation of a Belt and Road cooperation plan, and make all-out efforts to advance the Colombo Port City project and the integrated development project of Hambantota Port as signature projects of Belt and Road cooperation between the two countries, the joint statement said. Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) is Chinas ambitious multi-country varied infrastructure project. According to the joint statement, Sri Lanka has agreed to accelerate the formulation of a BRI cooperation plan notwithstanding criticism of their financial viability. China is Sri Lankas largest bilateral lender owning 52 per cent of the USD 40 billion external debt when Sri Lanka announced its first sovereign default in 2022. Seventeen countries that had extended loans to Sri Lanka formed a committee last year to discuss steps for debt restructuring negotiations but China preferred to take part only as an observer. Sri Lanka said it would negotiate the settlement of its Chinese loans on comparable terms with that of other countries that have provided the loans. The development comes days after the IMF, which concluded its second review of the USD 2.9 billion bailout with Sri Lanka earlier this month, said reaching an agreement with the countrys commercial creditors, the international bondholders and China Development Bank was the key to achieving debt sustainability. This was the first visit by a top Sri Lankan leader to Beijing after Colombo put a moratorium on recurring visits by Chinese research ships to Sri Lankan ports, reportedly due to Indias security concerns. Colombos move had drawn angry reactions from Beijing. Earlier this month, however, Sri Lanka said it would allow foreign offshore research ships for replenishments at its ports despite a one-year ban on such vessels. Some of Chinas infrastructure investments in Sri Lanka drew global concerns over Beijings debt diplomacy especially after China took over Hambantota port on a 99-year debt swap.

        "date": "March 31, 2024 12:06 pm",
        "content": "Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi slammed the Congress party on Sunday over the Katchatheevu island controversy, following a Right To Information (RTI) report revealing the decision of the then-Prime Minister, Indira Gandhis government, to hand over the strategic island of Katchatheevu to Sri Lanka in 1974. Describing the revelation as eye-opening and startling, PM Modi accused the grand old party of weakening the countrys integrity and interests. PM Modi dubbed it a callous decision and also said that the handover of Katchatheevu by the Congress government has angered every Indian. This has angered every Indian and reaffirmed in peoples minds. We cant ever trust Congress. Weakening Indias unity, integrity, and interests has been Congress way of working for 75 years and counting, PM Modi wrote on X. Eye opening and startling! New facts reveal how Congress callously gave away Katchatheevu. This has angered every Indian and reaffirmed in peoples minds- we cant ever trust Congress! Weakening Indias unity, integrity and interests has been Congress way of working for  Narendra Modi (narendramodi) March 31, 2024 BJP spokesperson Sudhanshu Trivedi claimed that the decision of the then Congress government at the Centre has led to the capture and imprisonment of Tamil Nadu fishermen by Lankans as they at times wander to the island, which is only 25 km off their states coast, and are arrested. The island was with India till 1975, he said. Tamil Nadu fishermen used to go there earlier but the agreement India signed with Lanka under the Indira Gandhi government barred them from doing so, he added. Unfortunately, neither the DMK nor the Congress is raising the issue but Modi is due to his commitment to the issues pertaining to the country and its people, he said. PM Modis tweet also prompted a response from the Congress party with its leader Sandeep Dikshit saying, The problem with the PM is he makes statements without any references. If any agreement like this was made, we should know what it was... Secondly, what PM was doing for 9 years then? If he was in a position of this information, why was the PM quiet about it all this while? These are selective pieces of propaganda that they fake out. It is all because elections are going on in Tamil Nadu. All the surveys show the BJP will be badly smashed in Tamil Nadu. About Katchatheevu Island row Katchatheevu Island, located between Rameswaram (India) and Sri Lanka, was traditionally used by both Sri Lankan and Indian fishermen. The documents, acquired by Tamil Nadu BJP state president K Annamalai through an RTI application, revealed Sri Lankas persistent efforts to claim 1.9 square kilometers of land approximately 20 kilometers from the Indian shore. Despite its small size, Sri Lanka pursued this claim tenaciously, while New Delhi contested it for decades before eventually acquiescing. Sri Lanka, then Ceylon, pressed its claim right after Independence, stating that the Indian Navy (then Royal Indian Navy) could not conduct exercises on the island without its permission. In October 1955, the Ceylon Air Force held its exercise on the island. The report also cites first prime minister Jawaharlal Nehrus comments on the issue, a source of dispute between India and Lanka, that he would have no hesitation in giving up claims on the island. In 1974, then prime minister Indira Gandhi accepted Katchatheevu as Sri Lankan territory under the Indo-Sri Lankan Maritime agreement. The 1974 Agreement regarding historic waters between Sri Lanka and India in the Palk Strait and the Palk Bay formally confirmed Sri Lankas sovereignty over the Island.

        "date": "March 31, 2024 01:57 pm",
        "content": "Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr has ordered his government to strengthen its coordination on maritime security to confront a range of serious challenges to territorial integrity and peace, as a dispute with China escalates. The order, signed on Monday and made public on Sunday, does not mention China but follows a series of bilateral maritime confrontations and mutual accusations over a disputed area of the South China Sea. Beijing claims almost all of the South China Sea, a conduit for more than 3 trillion of annual ship-borne commerce. Chinas claims overlap those of the Philippines, Vietnam, Indonesia, Malaysia and Brunei. The Permanent Court of Arbitration in 2016 said Chinas claims had no legal basis. The latest flare-up occurred last weekend, when China used water cannon to disrupt a Philippine resupply mission to the Second Thomas Shoal for soldiers guarding a warship intentionally grounded on a reef 25 years ago. Despite efforts to promote stability and security in our maritime domain, the Philippines continues to confront a range of serious challenges that threaten territorial integrity, but also the peaceful existence of Filipinos, Marcos said in the order. The president vowed on Thursday to implement countermeasures against illegal, coercive, aggressive and dangerous attacks by Chinas coastguard. His order expands and reorganises the governments maritime council, adding the national security adviser, solicitor general, National Intelligence Coordinating Agency chief and the South China Sea task force. The order appears to expand the role of the military by naming the Armed Forces of the Philippines, not just the navy, among the agencies supporting the council. The renamed National Maritime Council will be the central body to formulate strategies to ensure a unified, coordinated and effective framework for the Philippines maritime security and domain awareness. Marcos increased the number of agencies supporting the council to 13 from nine, including the space agency and the University of the Philippines Institute for Maritime Affairs and the Law of the Sea.

        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe stated that the outmoded film corporation would be transformed using modern technology, and it would be developed into a film and teledrama industries development company in Sri Lanka. Also, President Wickremesinghe highlighted the importance of providing foreign training opportunities to artists and production designers. This measure seeks to equip them with the latest technological knowledge, emphasizing the need for the film and teledrama industries to embrace modern advancements for future progress. He further mentioned that artificial intelligence (AI) technology has integrated into the global film industry, and moving forward, the government will extend support for the production of Sri Lankas first AI film. President Ranil Wickremesinghe made this statement while addressing the 20th Raigam Telees Awards ceremony held at the Shangri-La Hotel in Colombo yesterday (30). The annual Raigam Telees Awards ceremony, organized by the Raigam Telees Secretariat, is based on a concept introduced by Mr. Dr. Ravi Liyanage, the president of the Kingdom of Raigam Group and a renowned entrepreneur in the country. This prestigious event honours excellence in teledramas, media programs, and television news programs screened during the year 2023, with over sixty awards presented across seven categories. President Ranil Wickramasinghe joined the Raigam Special Pranama Awards ceremony where veteran artists Mr. Atula Ransirilal, Mr. Givantha Arthasad, and Mrs. Grace Thennakoon were honoured with awards presented by the President. The prestigious Raigam Pratibha Prabha Honorary Award, a once-in-a-lifetime recognition, was conferred to Dr. Rohana Weerasinghe by the President. Additionally, veteran actor Mr. Mahendra Perera was honoured as the best teledrama actor of the year, and Mrs. Semini Iddamalgoda was recognized as the best teledrama actress of the year. The award ceremony was vibrant, featuring performances by seasoned singers and actors. President Ranil Wickremesinghe, who took part in a group photo with all the award recipients from the arts and journalism fields, also engaged in a pleasant conversation with the guests, including veteran artists and singers. During his speech at the Raigam Telees Awards ceremony, President Ranil Wickramasinghe elaborated: The award ceremony, initiated by the Raigam Group, is celebrating its 20th anniversary today. I would like to thank the Raigam Group for their contribution to this award ceremony. I extend my gratitude to the Raigam Group for their valuable contributions to this event. Over the last twenty years, there has been a significant revolution in television. Nowadays, television faces competition from mobile phones and laptops. The world is advancing with platforms like Netflix and Amazon. We need to keep pace with these developments. Many countries are producing films in multiple languages, including smaller nations like Greece. We should also pay attention to this. Its essential for us to take note of these trends and adapt accordingly. Hence, our primary focus is on modernizing the outmoded film corporation and transforming it into a film and teledrama development entity. It is worth mentioning that we are actively working to facilitate the required expertise for this transition. During the inception of television, numerous individuals were offered training opportunities in Japan, which resulted in the emergence of new teledramas such as Yasoravaya during that period. We want to emphasize that we will be revisiting and working on similar initiatives in the near future. Furthermore, artificial intelligence (AI) technology has become a part of the film industry since last year. The Frost short film is an example of a production created using AI technology, including the screenplay. India is also producing Maharaja in Denims, which will soon be introduced in Sri Lanka. Its imperative for us to make preparations for these advancements as well. I have instructed the committee that we appointed for the introduction of artificial intelligence in Sri Lanka to collaborate with the University of Moratuwa and the University of Beauty in producing Sri Lankas first AI film. It should be noted that the government is working to provide funding for this. In this way, the film industry is undergoing a change that we did not anticipate. I invite everyone to embark on a new journey by modernizing the film corporation and creating the first AI film. Transport, Highways, and Mass Media Minister Dr. Bandula Gunawardena, Professor Sunil Ariyaratne, Professor J. B. Dissanayake, numerous distinguished guests, veteran actresses including Mrs. Swarna Mallavarachchi, singers, artists, film directors, producers, and several renowned guests were present at the event. --PMD--",

        "content": "Samagi Jana Balavegaya (SJB) Parliamentarian Dr. Harsha de Silva alleges that former President Maithripala Sirisena has provided a controversial statement linking India to the Easter Sunday terror attacks, which will likely cause a critical diplomatic crisis. Quoting a report published on a national newspaper, de Silva stressed that the ex-president has claimed that India was behind the Easter Sunday massacres and that an Indian diplomat whom he named has not only confessed to him about the attack but also the reason. The reason was said to be because Sri Lanka has not consider handing over India any projects, according to the lawmaker. Expressing his stance regarding the relevant claims, Harsha de Silva stated that this is an extremely irresponsible statement. Then what happened to all his statements made so far? Several more issues will arise in dragging another country into this problem. They will ask for the basis of this statement. Would anyone else make a confession like that, except for a diplomat with a mental health issue? he stresses. He should have evidence to make such a statement. We see this as a statement made to create a diplomatic issue between the two countries, de Silva added. Against this backdrop, MP Patali Champika Ranawaka also disclosed several facts in relation to the Easter Sunday terror attacks, while addressing an event held in Ratnapura on Saturday (30). The MP expressed: Keep in mind that the Easter Attacks drama was a well-organized performance carried out by a corrupted group who lost power in 2015. They carried out this act in a well-planned manner for five years. Zahran Hashim left the Thowheed Jamath organization in 2017, as clearly shown in the Presidents Committee report Presidential Commission of Inquiry on the Easter Attacks. It mentions the people who helped him, those who took him away, and the manner in which he carried out the attack, he added. Zahran had visited every location where conflicts had arisen, conducted classes, and won over Muslim youth to his side. All others were well-aware of this matter, the MP stressed. Mr. Gotabaya Rajapaksas appointment occurred only after a five-year conspiracy, the lawmaker claimed.",

        "date": "March 31, 2024 09:05 pm",
        "content": "Personal information belonging to millions of past and present ATT customers has been leaked online, including Social Security numbers (SSNs), passcodes and contact details, the multinational company says. In a statement on Saturday, the telecommunication network  the largest in the United States  said a recently discovered dataset on the dark web contained information for about 7.6 million current ATT account holders and 65.4 million former users, totalling about 73 million affected accounts. It is not known if the breach originated from ATT or one of its vendors, the company said. To the best of our knowledge, the compromised data appears to be from 2019 or earlier and does not contain personal financial information or call history, the statement added. All 7.6 million existing account holders whose sensitive personal information was compromised were set to be notified about the breach ATT. The company said it had already reset passcodes and was investigating the incident. In addition to passcodes and SSNs, the hacked data possibly included email and mailing addresses, phone numbers and birth dates, ATT added. Reports of the breach first surfaced on a hacking forum nearly two weeks ago. It is unclear if the leak is linked to a similar breach in 2021 that was widely reported but that ATT did not acknowledge. A hacker at the time claimed to have access to data of 70 million ATT customers, including their names, addresses, phone numbers, SSNs, and date of birth. Auction data on a hacking forum revealed the hacker attempted to sell the stolen information for thousands of dollars. If they assess this and they made the wrong call on it, and weve had a course of years pass without them being able to notify impacted customers then its likely the company will soon face class action lawsuits, cybersecurity expert Troy Hunt told The Associated Press news agency. Troy, the creator of Have I Been Pwned?  a website that alerts subscribers to data breaches  said in a blogpost at least 153,000 of his customers were affected. The Dallas-based company faced challenges earlier in February after an outage temporarily knocked out mobile phone service for thousands of users. ATT blamed the incident on a technical coding error, not a malicious attack. Other networks were also affected, but ATT appeared to be the hardest hit. --With agencies inputs",

        "date": "March 31, 2024 10:19 pm",
        "content": "Pope Francis called for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza and the release of all Israeli hostages in an Easter Sunday address that marked the most important day on the Christian calendar by deploring the suffering caused by wars. The pontiff presided over Mass in a packed and flower-bedecked St Peters Square, and then delivered his Urbi et Orbi (to the city and the world) blessing and message from the central balcony of St. Peters Basilica. Francis, 87, has been in poor health in recent weeks, forcing him on repeated occasions to limit his public speaking and cancel engagements as he did on Good Friday, skipping at short notice a procession at Romes Colosseum. However, he took part in other Holy Week events leading up to Easter, and appeared in relatively good spirits on Sunday. Easter celebrates the day in which the faithful believe Jesus rose from the dead. After the service, Francis took to his open-topped popemobile to greet crowds in the square and the avenue connecting St Peters to the River Tiber. The Vatican said about 60,000 people had turned up. WHY ALL THIS DEATH? Francis has repeatedly deplored the death and destruction in the Gaza war and he renewed his call for a ceasefire on Sunday. I appeal once again that access to humanitarian aid be ensured to Gaza, and call once more for the prompt release of the hostages seized on last October 7 and for an immediate ceasefire in the Strip, he said in his Urbi et Orbi address. How much suffering we see in the eyes of children, the children have forgotten to smile in those war zones. With their eyes, children ask us: Why? Why all this death? Why all this destruction? War is always an absurdity and a defeat, he added. The popes Easter message traditionally focuses on world affairs, and he mentioned other flashpoints, including Ukraine, Syria, Lebanon, Armenia and Azerbaijan, Haiti, Myanmar, Sudan, the Sahel and Horn of Africa regions, Congo and Mozambique. After asking Italian Cardinal Matteo Zuppi last year to mediate the repatriatian of Ukrainian children from Russia and Russian-occupied territories, Francis called for a general exchange of all prisoners between Russia and Ukraine. He also condemned human trafficking and prayed for a path of hope for those suffering from violence, hunger and the effects of climate change, as well as consolation for the victims of terrorism in all its forms.

        "date": "April 1, 2024 10:28 am",
        "content": "Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday said that new details on the Katchatheevu island issue have unmasked DMKs (Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam) double standards totally. His remarks came a day after he attacked the Congress over its decision to hand over the strategic island to Sri Lanka in the 1970s. In a post on X, the Prime Minister said, Rhetoric aside, DMK has done NOTHING to safeguard Tamil Nadus interests. New details emerging on Katchatheevu have UNMASKED the DMKs double standards totally. Congress and DMK are family units. They only care that their own sons and daughters rise. They dont care for anyone else. Their callousness on Katchatheevu has harmed the interests of our poor fishermen and fisherwomen in particular, he added. Katchatheevu island is where fishermen from Tamil Nadu go to fish. But they are detained by the Sri Lankan Navy as soon as they cross the International Maritime Border Line (IMBL) to reach the island. On Sunday, Prime Minister Modi not only attacked the Congress for handing over the island to Sri Lanka but also accused the party of weakening the countrys integrity and interests. His remarks came in response to a Right To Information (RTI) report which revealed how the Congress government led by then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi handed over Katchatheevu to Sri Lanka in 1974. Eye-opening and startling! New facts reveal how Congress callously gave away Katchatheevu. This has angered every Indian and reaffirmed in peoples minds - we cant ever trust Congress! Weakening Indias unity, integrity and interests has been Congress way of working for 75 years and counting, he tweeted citing a media report. Also on Monday, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar also criticised the DMK and Congress on the Katchatheevu island row, saying the two parties have approached this matter as though they have no responsibility for it. While addressing a press conference in Delhi, Jaishankar said, In the last 20 years, 6,184 Indian fishermen have been detained by Sri Lanka and 1,175 Indian fishing vessels have been seized, detained or apprehended. This is the background of the issue that we are discussing. In the last five years, the Katchatheevu issue and the fishermans issue have been repeatedly raised by various parties in Parliament. It has come up in parliament questions, debates and in the consultative committee. The then Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu has written to me numerous times. And my record shows that to the current Chief Minister, I have replied 21 times on this issue. This is not an issue which has suddenly surfaced. This is a live issue, he added. He said that although the matter has been the subject of correspondence between the union government and the state government... every political party in Tamil Nadu has taken a position on this. Two parties, the Congress and the DMK, have approached this matter as though they have no responsibility for it. As though the situation is for todays Central government to resolve, there is no history to this, Jaishankar added. The External Affairs Minister further claimed that we know who did this, what we dont know is who hid it. We believe that the public has the right to know how this situation came up. This issue has been hidden too long from the gaze of the public. The fishermen are still being detained today, boats are still being apprehended, and the issue is still being raised in Parliament. It is being raised in Parliament by two parties who did it, he said. Whenever there was an arrest, how do you think they were released? It is very good to give statements from Chennai, but the people who do the work are us. The Prime Ministers remarks on Sunday led to criticism from both the Congress and DMK. While Congress chief Mallikarjun Kharge asked if the BJP-led NDA government at the Centre took any steps to resolve the issue and take back the island, the DMK said the BJP was busy playing blame games with the Opposition and alleged it was afraid to campaign on its achievements. --With agencies inputs",

The minister, who spoke in condition of anonymity, confirmed in a message that the attack only caused some damage. The minister has not disclosed any further details. Two citizens said they had heard massive explosions near the sea in Tripolis luxury Hay Andalus neighbourhood, the home to PM Dbeibahs residence. A citizen said that after the massive explosions were heard, heavy security forces with their vehicles were deployed around the area. Libya has had little peace or stability since a 2011 NATO-backed uprising, and split in 2014 between eastern and western factions, with rival administrations governing each area. Dbeibahs Government of National Unity was installed through a U.N.-backed process in 2021 but the parliament, in the east, stopped recognising its legitimacy at the end of that year after a failed attempt to hold national elections, which led to prolonged political deadlock. Early of March, three key leaders said they agreed on the necessity of forming a new unified government that would supervise long-delayed elections. Dbeibah has vowed not to cede power to a new government without national elections. Source - Reuters --Agencies",

        "date": "April 1, 2024 11:05 am",
        "content": "A Melbourne woman has been saved from sending thousands of dollars to her sick overseas boyfriend after being caught up in a romance scam. The woman, aged in her 60s, went to a NAB branch in Cranbourne, in Melbournes southeast in February, wanting to deposit 2,000 into an account to help her boyfriend, whom she met on social media. She said her boyfriend, who was living in Turkey, was sick and needed the money to fly to the UK for treatment. But his account had apparently been frozen. He told her to instead send the money to his friend in Sydney who could then transfer him the money, NAB Customer Advisor, Dilan Pathirannahalage said in a statement. However, alarm bells quickly went off for Mr Pathirannahalage when the woman wasnt able to provide the recipients surname. The reason she didnt know who she was transferring the funds to was because she had never met the person on the other end of the line who she thought was her boyfriend, and so didnt know their friends either. The woman then showed Mr Pathirannahalage a string of text messages from a conversation with her boyfriend, raising further concern. The messages were very lovey dovey, and looked like they were getting increasingly coercive, he said. While speaking to Mr Pathirannahalage at the bank, the scammer called the woman to ask when she was transferring the money. For Mr Pathirannahalage, it was the final red flag. Even though the holes in the scammers story were clear to me, she was blinded by her love for him. These criminals are cunning and will prey on peoples kindness to steal their money. I needed to act fast to convince Maxine not to deposit the money into the account. I said I would never do this if I were you. I believe you are being scammed. He contacted the fraud team to investigate and take action. Mr Pathirannahalage said the woman was thankful he intervened and saved her from losing an entire pay cheque. She would have joined hundreds of Aussies who have recently fallen victim to romance scams. Last year, Scamwatch received over 400 reports of romance baiting scams, costing Aussies 40 million. According to NAB, customer reports of romance scams have increased 29 per cent year-on-year. NAB Executive, Group Investigations Chris Sheehan said the bank sees people of all ages and demographics targeted by romance scams, adding its important to know the red flags to look out for. These scams can have a devastating impact  both financial and emotional, he said in a statement. Romance and friendship scams re-enforce the need for a co-ordinated, national approach to the scam epidemic, given many start on dating apps, social media platforms or messaging apps. Mr Pathirannahalage said he was glad he was able to spend the extra time with (the woman) to stop her from falling victim to a romance scam. I want everyone to know that if youre not sure, just ask someone. Were here to help. Source: News.com.au --Agencies",

        "content": "The preliminary arrangements required to hold the presidential election have been completed, according to the Election Commission. Nevertheless, internal sources within the government revealed that President Ranil Wickremesinghe informed the Cabinet of Ministers and the Election Commission that no election will take place before the month of July, as the countrys debt restructuring programme under the International Monetary Fund (IMF) will be in progress until July. However, the Presidential Election is required to be held within this year, as per the Constitution. Last week, reports claimed that the presidential election will possibly take place in the period between end-September to early-October this year. Meanwhile, a member of the Election Commission stated that an amount of Rs. 10 billion has been allocated from the budget for holding the elections this year, and that all Assistant Election Commissioners have been informed regarding the preparation activities to hold the election. The Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) had requested the President to hold the general election before the presidential election and if so, the general election would have to be held before the month of August.",

        "title": "Katchatheevu neither acquired nor ceded, lies in Sri Lankan maritime area  UBT leader",
        "date": "April 1, 2024 01:52 pm",
        "content": "Adding fuel to the Katchatheevu row, Indias Shiv Sena (UBT) leader Priyanka Chaturvedi shared an RTI reply of 2015 where it was mentioned that the Katchatheevu island was neither acquired nor ceded and that it lies on the Sri Lankan side of the India-Sri Lanka International Maritime Boundary Line. In a post on X, Chaturvedi pointed out that the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) should be able to address the discrepancies in its RTI response in 2015 and its position in 2024. Maybe MEAIndia will be able to address these discrepancies in its RTI response in 2015 vis a vis 2024, Chaturvedi said. This did not involve either acquiring or ceding of territory belonging to India since the area in question had never been demarcated. Under the Agreements, the Island of Katchatheevu lies on the Sri Lankan side of the India-Sri Lanka International Maritime Boundary Line, the RTI reply which Chaturvedi said was from the MEA in 2015 read. Chaturvedi claimed that the RTI reply was given when External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar was serving as the countrys Foreign Secretary. Alleging a difference in opinions she said, Today the Foreign Minister and yesterday the India PM claimed it has been ceded So is the change in stance for their election politics or has Modiji made a case for Sri Lanka? Earlier in the day, Jaishankar had criticised the historic attitude of the Congress party towards the Katchatheevu island and said that Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru saw it as a nuisance. This is an observation by the then Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru in May of 1961. He says, he writes, I attach no importance at all to this little island and I would have no hesitation in giving up our claim to it. I do not like matters like this pending. Indefinitely and being raised again and again in parliament. So to Pandit Nehru, this was a little island. It had no importance. He saw it as a nuisance, EAM Jaishankar said in a press conference. However on Monday, Indias External affairs minister S Jaishankar lashed out at the Congress and DMK saying that the parties approached the Katchatheevu issue as though they bear no responsibility. He emphasized on the matter that the public has the right to know how Katchatheevu was given away. Addressing a press conference in Delhi, Jaishankar said, We know who did this, what we dont know is who hid it. Public has the right to know how Katchatheevu island was given to Sri Lanka, why even the fishing rights of Indian fishermen were also given up in 1976 after giving an assurance to the Parliament that fishing rights of Indians in the 1974 agreement have been safeguarded. In 1974, India and Sri Lanka concluded an agreement where they drew a maritime boundary, and in drawing the maritime boundary, Katchatheevu was put on the Sri Lankan side of the boundary, he added. He further said that India needs to sit with Sri Lankan authorities and find a solution. Highlighting the background of the issue, Jaishankar said, In the last 20 years, 6184 Indian fishermen have been detained by Sri Lanka and 1175 Indian fishing vessels have been seized, detained, or apprehended by Sri Lanka. This is the background of the issue that we are discussing. Calling it a live issue and not something that surfaced suddenly, Jaishankar said, The then CM of Tamil Nadu has written to me numerous times. And my record shows that to the current CM, I have replied 21 times on this issue. This is not an issue that has suddenly surfaced. This is a live issue. It is an issue that has been very much debated in parliament and in Tamil Nadu circles. It has been the subject of correspondence between the union government and the state government, he added. He also said, DMK questions handing over Katchatheevu to Sri Lanka, claims Tamil Nadu govt not consulted; fact is it was kept fully informed. Lashing out at Congress  DMK for their attitude towards the issue, he said, Congress  DMK have approached this matter as though they have no responsibility for this. As though the situation is for todays central government to resolve, there is no history to this, this has just happened, they are the people who are taking up the cause; that is the way they would like to project it, he added. Earlier in the day, India PM Modi cited a Times of India report and slammed DMK on the Katchatheevu island issue, saying the new details emerging on the matter have unmasked the partys double standards. The development comes a day after the Indian PM came down heavily on the Congress party and the DMK for giving away the Katchatheevu island to Sri Lanka during the tenure of the Indira Gandhi government in 1974. On Sunday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said that the Katchatheevu deal has infuriated people, adding that the Congress can never be trusted. Source: ANI  Times of India --Agencies",

        "title": "President appoints independent committee to review CBSL salary hikes",
        "date": "April 1, 2024 04:23 pm",
        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe, in his capacity as the Minister of Finance, Economic Stabilization and National Policies, has appointed an Independent Remuneration Committee to review the salary increase of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL). The Independent Remuneration Committee members include Mr Dinesh Stephen Weerakkody, Mr Arjuna Herath, Dr Indrajit Coomaraswamy, Mrs Sudharma Karunarathne, Mr Anthony Nihal Fonseka, Mr Anushka S Wijesinha and Mr Duminda Hulangamuwa. Responding to mounting pressures from Members of Parliament and the Committee on Public Finance (CoPF), President Wickremesinghe has established an independent remuneration committee. This committee will review the contentious salary hike based on the recommendations delineated in the CoPF report on CBSL salary revision, the Presidents Media Division said. The CoPF report, as presented to Parliament by (Dr.) Harsha de Silva, Chair of the Committee, underscores the paramount importance of transparency and accountability in the actions of the CBSL. It emphasizes that while CBSL retains autonomy, it is imperative for it to be answerable to Parliament, particularly amidst prevailing economic challenges confronting the nation. The committees remit encompasses assessing the reasonableness of the across-the-board salary increase and proposing adjustments that are in consonance with CBSLs mandate and economic exigencies. It will comprise members from both within and outside the CBSL, ensuring a diverse spectrum of perspectives in the decision-making process. Furthermore, the committee is tasked with formulating a transparent formula for future revisions to CBSL staff remuneration, thereby fostering equity and transparency in the salary framework. President Wickremesinghes expeditious action underscores his unwavering commitment to upholding accountability and ensuring prudent financial management within Sri Lanka. The nation anticipates the findings of the independent remuneration committee, poised to herald a new era of fiscal prudence and transparency within the CBSL, the PMD said. CoPF also recommended that a report on the same be submitted within 4 weeks and that CBSL defer the salary increase until a mutually acceptable solution is arrived at, based on the findings of the report. However on March 21, the CBSL informed the COPF that they accepted all recommendations from COPF report on salary revisions. It also announced that a majority of senior management and professionals of CBSL made a collective decision to consider a revision to their salaries that sparked controversy.",
