The four suspects, who were arrested in connection with the kidney transplant racket orchestrated at a hospital in Rajagiriya by promising large sums of money to low-income people, have been remanded till 31 January on orders of the Colombo Additional Magistrate Rajindra Jayasuriya. Three of them, including two Grama Niladhari officers, were arrested by the Colombo Crimes Division yesterday. The arrests were made based on the findings of the investigations conducted by the Colombo Crimes Division following several complaints received by the Borella police station. One of the three suspects, a 32-year-old broker in this kidney transplant racket, had been arrested in the Laundry Watta area in Armour Street, Colombo. Meanwhile, two Grama Niladhari officers belonging to the Sri Jayewardenepura Kotte and Kolonnawa Divisional Secretariat Divisions have been arrested for aiding and abetting the racket by falsifying documents for a fee of Rs. 20,000 each. The two suspects, aged 59 years, were identified as residents of Rajagiriya and Kaduwela areas. Further investigations into the matter are being conducted by the Colombo Crimes Division.",

        "content": "The overseas travel ban imposed on the former Central Bank Governor, Ajith Nivard Cabraal has been extended once again. Accordingly, Cabraal is further barred from travelling abroad until February 16. The order was delivered when a private plaint filed by former Governor of the Southern Province, Ranjith Keerthi Tennakoon was called before Colombo Additional Magistrate Harshana Kekunawala this morning (Jan 17). The plaintiff alleges that during his tenure as the Central Bank governor from 2006 to 2015, Cabraal had paid a sum of USD 6.5 million to Pakistani-American political donor Imaad Zuberi without the approval of Cabinet Ministers and thereby is responsible for criminal breach of trust and criminal abuse of funds. He also accused Cabraal of causing a loss of USD 500 million to the Government of Sri Lanka through sovereign bonds due on January 18, 2022, while serving as the Central Bank governor. According to the plaintiff, the Sri Lankan government incurred a loss of LKR 10.04 billion through the appointing of close relatives to positions and from the release of confidential information on Treasury bills and bond issues, during his tenure as the Governor of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka. When the case was taken up today, the attorney representing Tennakoon raised preliminary objections, for which the defence attorneys were ordered to present written submissions on February 16.",

        "title": "China records 1st population fall in decades as births drop",
        "date": "January 17, 2023 12:05 pm",
        "content": "China has announced its first population decline in decades as what has been the worlds most populous nation ages and its birthrate plunges. The National Bureau of Statistics reported Tuesday that the country had 850,000 fewer people at the end of 2022 than the previous year. The tally includes only the population of mainland China, excluding Hong Kong and Macao as well as foreign residents. That left a total of 1.41 billion people, with 9.56 million births against 10.41 million deaths, the bureau said at a briefing on Tuesday. Men outnumbered women by 722.06 million to 689.69 million, a result of the strict one-child policy that only officially ended in 2016 and a traditional preference for male offspring to carry on the family name. Since abandoning the policy, China has sought to encourage families to have second or even third children, with little success, reflecting attitudes in much of east Asia where birth rates have fallen precipitously. In China, the expense of raising children in cities is often cited as a cause. China has long been the worlds most populous nation, but is expected to soon be overtaken by India, if it has not already. Estimates put Indias population at more than 1.4 billion and continuing to grow. The last time China is believed to have recorded a population decline was during the Great Leap Forward launched at the end of the 1950s, under then-leader Mao Zedongs disastrous drive for collective farming and industrialization that produced a massive famine killing tens of millions of people. Chinas population has begun to decline 9-10 years earlier than Chinese officials predicted and the United Nation projected, said Yi Fuxian, a demographer and expert on Chinese population trends at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. That means that Chinas real demographic crisis is beyond imagination and that all of Chinas past economic, social, defense, and foreign policies were based on faulty demographic data, Yi told The Associated Press. Yi said that, based on his own research, Chinas population has actually been declining since 2018, showing the population crisis is much more severe than previously thought. China now has one of the lowest fertility rates in the world, comparable only to Taiwan and South Korea, he added. Chinas looming economic crisis will be worse than Japans, where years of low growth have been blamed in part on a shrinking population, Yi said. China has become older before it has become rich, Yi said. Chinas statistics bureau said the working-age population between 16 and 59 years old totaled 875.56 million, accounting for 62.0 of the national population, while those aged 65 and older totaled 209.78 million, accounting for 14.9 of the total. The statistics also showed increasing urbanization in a country that traditionally had been largely rural. Over 2022, the permanent urban population increased by 6.46 million to reach 920.71 million, or 65.22, while the rural population fell by 7.31 million. It wasnt immediately clear if the population figures have been affected by the COVID-19 outbreak that was first detected in the central Chinese city of Wuhan before spreading around the world. China has been accused by some specialists of underreporting deaths from the virus by blaming them on underlying conditions, but no estimates of the actual number have been published. The United Nations estimated last year that the worlds population reached 8 billion on Nov. 15 and that India will replace China as the worlds most populous nation in 2023. Indias last census was scheduled for 2022 but was postponed amid the pandemic. In a report released on World Population Day, the U.N. also said global population growth fell below 1 in 2020 for the first time since 1950. Also Tuesday, the bureau released data showing Chinas economic growth fell to its second-lowest level in at least four decades last year under pressure from anti-virus controls and a real estate slump. The worlds No. 2 economy grew by 3 in 2022, less than half of the previous years 8.1, the data showed. That was the second-lowest annual rate since at least the 1970s, after the drop to 2.4 in 2020 at the start of the coronavirus pandemic, although activity is reviving after restrictions that kept millions of people at home and sparked protests were lifted.",

        "date": "January 17, 2023 12:54 pm",
        "content": "India formally notified that it would support Sri Lankas debt restructuring plan, clearing a major hurdle for the bankrupt nation to unlock a 2.9 billion bailout from the International Monetary Fund, Bloomberg reported citing a person with knowledge of the matter. India, one of Sri Lankas major bilateral creditors, gave its assurances late Monday, the person said, asking not to be identified as the details arent public. An announcement could be made as early as Tuesday, another person said. With very positive developments taking place over the past 12 hours, Sri Lanka is confident of reaching IMF board approval in the first quarter of 2023, Sri Lankas junior Finance Minister Shehan Semasinghe said by phone Tuesday, when asked if India had assured support. He declined to elaborate. A text message to the IMF representative in Washington wasnt immediately answered. Indias Finance Ministry spokesperson declined to comment. Sri Lanka still needs similar assurances from China, Japan and so-called Paris Club members before the IMF board can approve the loan program. The end-2022 target for IMF board approval has already been missed and Standard Chartered Plc predicted earlier this month that the multilateral lender may give the greenlight only between April-June, which means talks with commercial creditors are likely to be pushed to the second half of 2023, it said. Sri Lanka concluded debt restructuring talks with Japan, President Ranil Wickremesinghe announced last week, without sharing details. A delegation from China is visiting Sri Lanka through Jan. 18 and Indian Foreign Minister S. Jaishankar is expected to visit from Jan. 19 ahead of Sri Lanka celebrating 75 years of Independence from British rule on Feb. 4. Debt negotiations had yielded little progress since Sri Lanka defaulted in May, with creditors bickering on the size of losses they are willing to accept and whether local debt should be included in the restructuring. Sri Lanka fell deeper into recession last year as tighter monetary policy and sky-high inflation compounded its debt woes. While the government has made some progress in restoring the economys health with basic goods like food and fuel becoming more easily available, Sri Lanka still is a long way from recovery, relying on repurposed funds from multilateral lenders and aid from friendly nations for relief.

        "content": "The government of Sri Lanka has decided to halt the printing of money, Cabinet Spokesman Bandula Gunawardena announced. Speaking at the Cabinet briefing held this morning (17 Jan.), Gunawardena noted that despite the ongoing financial crisis, the government has decided to halt the money printing process as a matter of policy, as this would only further increase Sri Lankas debt issues. Currently, we are unable to obtain any loans, as we have already made it clear to the international forum that we need our debts to be restructured as we are unable to pay any of them. Thus, we cannot obtain any loans, nor can we print more money, because if we do so, we will be unable to obtain any loans in the future as well, the Cabinet Spokesman explained. Highlighting the dilemma currently being faced by the government, Gunawardena stressed on the difficulties faced with regard to bearing the states daily expenses, adding that based on data received by the Secretary to the Finance Ministry, only a total of Rs. 141 billion was earned by the government for the month of December 2022 by way of tax and other forms, while the cost incurred for that month amounted to Rs. 154 billion. Questioning how the government is supposed to bear these expenses, Gunawardena stressed that management of finances has now become impossible, adding that finding an alternative solution too, seems unlikely.",

Amarasinghe was arrested by the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) on 05 January, after making several controversial statements about the much-venerated Temple of the Sacred Tooth Relic in Kandy. The YouTubers claims led to chaotic uproar amongst Sri Lankas predominantly Buddhist society, officials of the CID highlighted, while the Director General of Department of Archaeology also asserted that the slanderous statements in question were a grave wrongdoing. The Chief Prelates of the Malwatta and Asgiriya chapters have also informed the CID that they are ready to provide statements pertaining to the matter, the CID informed the court. Investigations have also revealed that Amarasinghe had received funds from persons overseas, regarding which the CID are conducting further probes under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, and the Convention on the Suppression of Terrorist Financing Act. The CID initiated investigations into the statements made by Amarasinghe after Inspector-General of Police (IGP) C.D. Wickramaratne received written complaints in this regard, which lead to Amarasinghes arrest. The chief prelates of Malwatta and Asgiriya chapters, Most Ven. Thibbatuwawe Sri Siddhartha Sumangala Thero and Most Ven. Warakagoda Sri Gnanarathana Thero also wrote to President Ranil Wickremesinghe, raising concerns about the offensive statements made by Amarasinghe, and urged the government to take necessary measures to nip the matter in the bud. Meanwhile, Justice Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe, while speaking in parliament, vowed legal action against Amarasinghe, stressing that the religious harmony in the country cannot be allowed to be disrupted. Pursuant to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) Act, No. 56 of 2007, propagating war or advocating national, racial, or religious hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence is a punishable offense with rigorous imprisonment for a term not exceeding 10 years.",

Accordingly, an allocation of at least Rs. 30-40 billion would be made for this purpose, the Head of State mentioned while addressing the parliament earlier today. In response to the accusations levelled at the government for not making sufficient allocations for the procurement of medicines, the President stated that the Treasury and the Health Ministry are jointly working to ensure that sufficient stocks of medicines are procured. However, placing orders would take some time, the President said further, adding that it is not the intention of the government to let people suffer from shortages of medicines. Speaking on resolving the economic crisis, President Wickremesinghe reiterated that the government is taking necessary efforts to put the country back on the right path. With regard to the ongoing talks with Sri Lankas bilateral creditors, President Wickremesinghe said what is left to do now is to get the support of India and China to restructure the countrys debts. According to him, the discussions with these two bilateral creditors have thus far been successful. Meanwhile, speaking on the public sector salaries, the President said the employees can rest assured that salaries would definitely be paid, although not on time. The government is also giving prominence to the payments of pensions and allowances to Samurdhi beneficiaries, he assured. Responding to the concerns raised with regard to the financial allocations made by the government for the upcoming Independence Day celebrations, President Wickremesinghe noted that this is an investment for the future. The Independence Day celebrations are not limited to the parades, he added, stressing that in the 25 years leading up to the 100th anniversary of the Independence Day, many new institutions and laws would be introduced for Sri Lankas much-needed reforms.",

        "title": "Wikipedia needs different safety rules, says foundation",
        "date": "January 17, 2023 04:05 pm",
        "content": "Wikipedia should be treated differently to the big social media firms in the Online Safety Bill, a leading member of its foundation says. The encyclopaedia is written and edited entirely by thousands of volunteers around the world. The Wikimedia Foundations Rebecca MacKinnonalso says a proposed change to the bill, would limit freedom of expression. The bill aims to protect people from harmful content online. The Wikimedia Foundation is the not-for-profit organisation which hosts the encyclopaedia. Ms MacKinnon says the foundation is concerned about the effect of the bill on volunteer-run sites. She told the BBC that the threat of harsh new criminal penalties for tech bosses will affect not only big corporations but also public interest websites such as Wikipedia. Ms MacKinnon says the law should follow the EU Digital Services Act which, she argues, differentiates between centralised content moderation carried out by employees and Wikipedia-style moderation by community volunteers. The government told the BBC the bill is designed to strike the balance between tackling harm without imposing unnecessary burdens on low-risk tech companies. Regulator Ofcom will take a reasonable and proportionate approach when monitoring and enforcing the safety duties outlined in the bill, focusing on services where the risk of harm is highest, it said. Multi-player game How sites are treated under the bill partly depends on their size. But lawyers have also pointed out that some of the duties in the bill, promoted as a way to rein in big tech, will affect much smaller services where users can communicate with other users. Nearly 50 Tory MPs wanted to amend the Online Safety Bill to introduce two-year sentences for managers who fail to stop children seeing harmful material. Under a deal with the rebels to stave off defeat, ministers have now promised to introduce similar proposals. Neil Brown, a solicitor specialising in internet and telecoms law, told the BBC: The bill, and the amendment, would impose pages of duties on someone who, for fun, runs their own social media or photovideo sharing server, or hosts a multi-player game which lets players chat or see each others content or creations. He suggests limiting the scope of the bill to the major commercial operators with multi-million pound turnover would help remove the burden and threat to hobbyists and volunteers. Wikipedia is the eighth most visited website in the UK, according to data from software company Similarweb, but everything on the site is produced by volunteers, and the community decides what is acceptable. Ms MacKinnon says it has been caught in a net designed for the likes of Facebook and Instagram where decisions are centralised. The foundation believes in community decision making, and does not get involved with the articles, she says, but the bill could force it to intervene if a volunteer editor kept up an article which might break UK law, for example. It forces the foundation to break the community model, and proactively take things down, she says. However, the government says a site like Wikipedia will be able to develop its own approaches to community moderation, as long as it tackles illegal content and protects children. It is also understood that officials believe Wikipedia is unlikely to be classed as a Category 1 service, subject to the strictest rules. Ms MacKinnon says any UK changes would affect all readers of Wikipedia in English, including those in the US, an example the UK regulating the world, she says. Harmful definitions Wikipedia has articles covering topics like sexuality, pornography, drug use, and suicide, which some might feel could be harmful for children to view. Measures in the bill mean it worries it might have to check the ages of users, which would require collecting more information about readers, which Wikipedia tries to avoid. For example, Ms MacKinnon says the page about the Russian invasion of Ukraine is illegal in Russia. Age verification could mean collecting information on readers which might then be requested by a government or be hacked. It actually ultimately exposes everyone, including children to greater harm, she says. Blunt instrument The plans to amend the bill so that those who break the rules could face jail time for failing to protect children online, won cross party support with Labour backing the change. And a number of prominent childrens charities and campaigners lent their support. But industry body TechUK, say the amendment will be seen as a very open-ended risk by investors and could mean companies do not invest and locate senior talent in the UK. Source - BBC -Agencies",

        "date": "January 17, 2023 06:13 pm",
        "content": "China has assured that it stands ready to work with the relevant countries and institutions with regard to aiding Sri Lanka in terms of its debt. Speaking at a press conference yesterday (16 Jan.), the Spokesman for Chinas Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Wang Wenbin, noted that China has been closely following the ongoing difficulties faced by the island nation, and has provided all possible assistance for both, Sri Lankas social and economic development, to the best of their capabilities. In response to a question raised pertaining to Sri Lankas debt restructuring and the impact Chinas Communist Partys recent visit has had on the matter, Wenbin noted that while a delegation of the Communist Party of China (CPC) recently visited the island, headed by Vice President Chen Zhou, he is unable to comment on the matter and thus referred the question to other relevant authorities. The Spokesman stated, however, that with regard to Sri Lankas dues to China, they support the relevant financial institutions in having consultations with Sri Lanka to seek a propoer settlement pertaining to the matter, adding that China stands ready to work with relevant countries and international financial institutions and continue to play a positive role in helping Sri Lanka navigate the situation, easing its debt burden and helping it achieve sustainable development. In the meantime, we hope and believe that Sri Lanka will work in the same direction and make independent efforts to uphold the legitimate rights and interests of foreign investment and financing partners, and maintain stability and credibility of its investment and financing environment, Wenbin concluded his response. Sri Lankas debt restructuring currently stands at a crucial juncture, with agreements underway between the government of Sri Lanka and its bilateral creditors; China, Japan and India. The island nation is also awaiting board approval for the International Monetray Fund (IMF) bailout, which is likely to be obtained in the first quarter of 2023, based on the aforementioned agreements.",

        "title": "President says talks with India and China on debt restructuring successful",
        "date": "January 17, 2023 06:46 pm",
        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe today invited the opposition to join hands through a new political system to provide relief to the people and free them from oppression. He made this request while speaking in parliament today (17). Despite the difficult economic background in the country, the President emphasized that the government is working to provide relief to the people, adding that he will take steps to allocate Rs. 30-40 billion for medicines this year. The President said that due to the prudent agricultural policies of the government, the country has seen a bountiful paddy harvest and the government has commenced a program to provide 02 million low-income families with 10 kilograms of rice per month over a period of 02 months. Responding to allegations that the government is spending excessively on the Independence celebrations, the President pointed out that it is an investment for the future and in the 25 years leading up to the 100th anniversary of independence, several new institutions and laws will be introduced for the reform program needed by the country. President Ranil Wickremesinghe further said: Currently, we are working to get our economy on the right track. Now we have to get India and China to consent to this debt restructuring. We are continuing discussions in that regard and I am pleased to announce to this House that the discussions are currently successful. We wont get the income we expect all at once. We hope to put all this together and carry out this work. Paying salaries is one of our main functions. Second is the payment of pensions. We should also provide the Samurdhi. Similarly, two more new programs will be implemented and we have to provide money for that too. Now we have been accused of not providing money for medicines. Another 100 million has to be given. There is one problem in the health sector, which is that we have to pay a bill of Rs. 50 billion for the last few years. However, despite these difficulties, we intend to allocate Rs. 30-40 billion this year for medicines. The Health Ministry and the Treasury will somehow join hands and carry out these matters. It will take some time to order these medicines. Even we dont like to see shortcomings at our hospitals, nor to see people dying due to the lack of medicines. Therefore, we have taken steps to allocate the necessary funds for the provision of medicines. Last year, there was a shortage of food in our country. We expected that there would be a shortage of food this year as well. But somehow we provided the required fertilizer to the farmers. Now we have a surplus of crops. We have got this paddy surplus due to a bountiful Yala season as well as the previous Maha season. Now we have to maintain the price of paddy at Rs. 100 per kilo. We have allocated Rs. 10 billion for this purpose. Previously, only a sum of Rs. 05 billion was allocated for it. The excess harvest was sold earlier, but we will not do that. We have planned a program to provide 02 million low-income families with 10kg of rice per month during March and April. I would be happier if we could give them more. As we celebrate our 75th Independence, we will not allow our people to starve. We will invest the funds required to feed them. Some people criticize the expenditure of the government on the independence celebration. But, we need to provide such relief to the people. We will have to spend another Rs. 10 billion within the next few years for the 25-year development plan. Its been 75 years since we gained independence achieved and we are taking measures to create several institutions by the time we reach our 100th-year independence celebration to bring about the required reforms in the country. Accordingly, we are working to establish an institution to study and do research about the history of the country. One of the biggest accusations against us is that we have forgotten our history and accordingly we should create such an institution. We are establishing an economic and trade institution similar to those in many different countries. In addition, for the first time in our country, we are setting up an institution for women and gender. Measures will also be taken to establish a university for training the officials on Government and State Policies. We should establish an agricultural technology university if we need our agriculture to be modernized. We too have plans to establish a University on Climate Change to which foreign countries have already expressed their willingness to assist. We too hope to establish a sports university to train this countrys athletes to international standards. We need funds for these activities. These may cost more than Rs. 10 billion. We do not spend money at once on these projects. Our 75th independence celebration does not end there. We are implementing these programs for the future. We are taking measures to pass some new laws. They are the National Commission for Women Act, the Gender Equality Act, and the Womens Empowerment Act. When these three acts are passed, ours will become the country in South Asia that has taken the highest measures for the safety of women. We would also pass the Climate Change Act, Forest Replantation and Tree Cover Act etc. In addition, with the passage of the Living Entity Act, we would get the rightful ownership of the Mahaweli river, Sinharaja Forest, Sripada Site, Horton Plains, Knuckles and Adams Bridge etc. The country would become one with the best environmental laws in the region with the passage of the laws for marine resources exploration and management and the Muthurajawela (Conservation) Act. The future generations are demanding we protect these resources for them. We are introducing the Social Justice Commission Act as well as we need to work for social justice. In addition to those programs, allocations should be made for establishing 75 urban forests this year and the National Youth Platform project programs. We will also take measures to implement a 1996 housing project for low-income earners in the Colombo district and Gampaha districts. Despite the existing economic crisis in the country, we are working hard to provide relief to the people. On this 75th independence anniversary, I propose to the opposition to change the existing political system. Lets work together to provide relief to the people. If we could achieve such progress with these limited resources, I urge everyone to work together for the future of the country. Source: PMD",

        "date": "January 17, 2023 07:11 pm",
        "content": "Seven international human rights organizations have urged the Sri Lankan government to end the arbitrary detention of Inter-University Students Federation (IUSF) convenor Wasantha Mudalige, who was arrested five months ago. The appeal was made by Amnesty International, Asian Forum for Human Rights  Development (FORUM-ASIA), CIVICUS, Frontline Defenders, Human Rights Watch, International Working Group on Sri Lanka and Sri Lanka Campaign for Peace  Justice. In August 2022, Mudalige was detained on charges of the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA). Mudalige was further remanded until January 31, after his bail application was taken up before Colombo Magistrates Court earlier today (Jan 17). Under the PTA, the court does not grant bail if the Attorney Generals Department opposes it. In their statement, the international rights groups said the detention of Mudalige is part of the Sri Lanka governments crackdown on activists since an economic crisis in 2022 sparked largely peaceful protests demanding governance reform and action against alleged official corruption. They accused the government of responding by giving sweeping powers to the police and military, which used unnecessary and excessive force to disperse demonstrations and arrest hundreds of people, including many students. The rights groups noted that although many of those detained have since been released on bail, the authorities have used extraordinary powers under the PTA to keep Mudalige in detention despite having produced no evidence of any involvement in terrorism. The Prevention of Terrorism Act allows for up to a year of detention without charge on the orders of the defense minister, who is currently President Wickremesinghe, the statement pointed out, alleging that the law has been used particularly to target members of the Tamil and Muslim communities, and to stifle dissenting voices including journalists and human rights defenders, since it was introduced as a temporary measure in 1979. The United Nations and human rights groups have repeatedly documented that the PTA has been used to enable prolonged arbitrary detention and torture or other ill-treatment. The rights groups also shed light on the repeated pledges made by successive Sri Lankan governments, including the present administration, to repeal the PTA and replace it with rights-respecting legislation  most recently to the European Union in October. Yet the government continues to use the law to violate human rights, in breach of its own domestic and international commitments. They urged the Sri Lankan authorities to immediately impose a moratorium on the use of the PTA, and promptly repeal it. The authorities should immediately review the detention of anyone held under the PTA, ensuring adequate access to fair bail hearings. They should also release all protesters facing charges that do not meet international standards. The statement also called on the Sri Lankan government to fully respect the rights to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly.",

        "content": "The Embassy of China in Colombo has slammed the Ambassador of the United States to Sri Lanka, Julie Chung over her remarks during a recent interview with a UK television program on Sri Lankas debt issue. In a press release, the Chinese embassy dismissed Chungs comments as baseless accusing and lecturing and lambasted the US envoy for putting the blame on China for being the spoiler to Sri Lankas negotiations with the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Chung recently told BBC Newsnight that the US is hopeful that China would not delay extending support for Sri Lankas debt restructuring process, as the island nation does not have time to delay, adding that it needs these assurances immediately. For the sake of the Sri Lankan people, we certainly hope China is not a spoiler as they proceed to attain this IMF agreement, Chung had said further. The Chinese embassy stated that it is hypocritical of the US to play the blame game instead of a self-examination. It also raised concerns as to why the US did not take decisive actions in the IMF for a more comfortable solution for Sri Lanka or extend grant to the island nation with the rocket amount of US dollars they print every year instead of sowing discord between China and Sri Lanka. Both Chinese and Sri Lankan people are wise enough to judge without any foreign lecturing who the spoiler of our development is, the embassy said further.",

        "date": "January 17, 2023 11:56 pm",
        "content": "Vietnams President Nguyen Xuan Phuc has announced he is stepping down, sparking a potential power shift among the communist-ruled countrys leaders. The move had been widely rumoured and follows the departure of two deputy prime ministers who served under him. Mr Phuc, a former prime minister, had held the post of president since 2021. The news that he is quitting comes during an anti-corruption drive led by hard-liners. Hundreds of Communist Party members are being investigated. The presidents resignation requires approval from the National Assembly, which will hold an extraordinary vote on Wednesday that is expected to be a formality. Confirmation from Vietnams official state media that the president was resigning followed weeks of speculation that he would leave his post. A party statement praised Mr Phucs leadership but said he was politically responsible for violations and the wrongdoing of numerous officials under him. As well as the two deputy prime ministers who resigned earlier this month, two ministers and other officials are facing criminal charges. As he was well aware of his responsibilities to the Party and the people, Phuc filed a request to resign from his positions and retire, the statement said. Mr Phuc, 69, served as prime minister from 2016 until April 2021, when he was elected president - one of the four pillars at the top of Vietnamese politics. The Communist Partys general secretary is the most powerful of the four posts, although the president also holds significant authority. The other two are the prime minister and the chairman of the National Assembly. Nguyen Phu Trong, the current party general secretary and the countrys most powerful politician, is leading the anti-corruption drive. The party has reported that in 2022 alone, 539 party members were prosecuted or disciplined for corruption and deliberate wrongdoings, including ministers, top officials and diplomats. Police also investigated 453 corruption cases, a 50 increase from the previous year in the country, which has one of Asias fastest growing economies. Reports say Mr Trong may now combine his post with Mr Phucs. This move would be temporary, it is suggested, and would mean power is less divided among the countrys leaders - but could also lead to an increase in authoritarianism. In a second potential scenario being talked about, another member of the partys top decision-making body, the Politburo, could be promoted to replace Mr Phuc as president. Source: BBC -Agencies",

The epicentre of the tremor was located 150 kilometres (93 miles) northwest of the eastern Indonesian island of Halmahera, at a depth of 48 kilometres. Hazardous tsunami waves are possible for coasts located within 300 kilometres of the earthquake epicentre, the NWS Pacific Tsunami Warning Center in Hawaii said in its warning after the quake. The quake occurred around 13:06 pm local time (0606 GMT). The quake was revised down from an initial magnitude of 7.2 reported by the USGS. Indonesias Meteorology, Climatology and Geophysics Agency (BMKG) warned of possible aftershocks. Indonesia experiences frequent seismic and volcanic activity due to its position on the Pacific Ring of Fire, where tectonic plates collide. On November 21, a 5.6-magnitude quake hit West Java province on Indonesias main island of Java, killing 602 people. Most of the victims were killed when buildings collapsed or in landslides triggered by the quake. A major earthquake off Sumatra on December 26, 2004, set off an Indian Ocean tsunami that killed more than 230,000 people as far away as Sri Lanka, India and Thailand.

We hereby confirm our strong support for Sri Lankas prospective (loan) program and commit to supporting Sri Lanka with financingdebt relief consistent with restoring Sri Lankas public debt sustainability, Indian finance ministry official Rajat Kumar Mishra told the IMF chief in a letter dated Jan. 16. Sri Lanka requires the backing of China and India - its biggest bilateral lenders - to reach a final agreement with the IMF on the 2.9 billion loan that is essential to help the country emerge from its worst financial crisis in seven decades. The financingdebt relief provided by Export-Import Bank of India will be consistent with restoring debt sustainability under the IMF-supported program, the official said. Sri Lanka has to secure prior financing assurances from creditors, put its heavy debt burden on a sustainable path and boost public revenue before the global lender will disburse the funds, the IMF has said. The island nation is confident of finalising support from the IMF in the first quarter of 2023. Sri Lanka owes India around 1 billion that will come under the debt restructuring plan, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters earlier this week. New Delhi separately provided Sri Lanka with about 4 billion in rapid assistance between January and July last year, including credit lines, a currency swap arrangement and deferred import payments.

Ms Ardern choked up as she detailed how six challenging years in the job had taken a toll. She will step down as Labour Party leader no later than 7 February. There will be a vote in the coming days to determine her replacement. New Zealand will hold a general election on 14 October. Ms Ardern, 42, said she had taken time to consider her future over the summer break. I had hoped that I would find what I needed to carry on over that period but, unfortunately, I havent, and I would be doing a disservice to New Zealand to continue, she told reporters. Ms Ardern became the youngest female head of government in the world when she was elected prime minister in 2017, aged 37. She has led New Zealand through the Covid-19 pandemic, the Christchurch mosque shootings, and the White Island volcanic eruption. Its one thing to lead your country through peace time, its another to lead them through crisis, she said. These events... have been taxing because of the weight, the sheer weight and continual nature of them. Theres never really been a moment where its ever felt like we were just governing. Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese paid tribute to Ms Ardern as a leader of intellect, strength and empathy. Jacinda has been a fierce advocate for New Zealand, an inspiration to so many and a great friend to me, he wrote on Twitter. Source: BBC -Agencies",

        "date": "January 19, 2023 08:33 am",
        "content": "Fitch Ratings has downgraded the National Insurer Financial Strength (IFS) Ratings of seven Sri Lankan insurers following the recent sovereign downgrade and recalibration of the agencys Sri Lankan National Rating scale. The seven insurers ratings have been maintained on Rating Watch Negative (RWN), the rating agency said on Thursday. The recalibration is to reflect changes in the relative creditworthiness among Sri Lankan issuers following Fitchs downgrade of Sri Lankas Long-Term Local Currency Issuer Default Rating (IDR) to CC from CCC on 1 December 2022. Fitch typically does not assign Outlooks or apply modifiers to sovereigns with a rating of CCC or below. National rating scales are a risk ranking of issuers in a particular market designed to help local investors differentiate risk. Sri Lankas national rating scale is denoted by the unique identifier (lka). Fitch adds this identifier to reflect the unique nature of the Sri Lankan national scale. National rating scales are not comparable with Fitchs international rating scales or with other countries national rating scales. The National IFS Ratings of the Sri Lankan insurers take into consideration their creditworthiness relative to other issuers in the country. The recalibration of the Sri Lankan National Rating scale has resulted in downgrades of the National IFS Ratings of the following insurers: - Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation Limited to A(lka)RWN from AA(lka)RWN; - National Insurance Trust Fund Board to A-(lka)RWN from A(lka)RWN; - Peoples Insurance PLC to A-(lka)RWN from A(lka)RWN; - HNB Assurance PLC to A-(lka)RWN from A(lka)RWN; - HNB General Insurance Limited to A-(lka)RWN from A(lka)RWN; - Continental Insurance Lanka Limited to A-(lka)RWN from A(lka)RWN; and - Construction Guarantee Fund to BB(lka)RWN from BBB-(lka)RWN.",

        "date": "January 19, 2023 03:49 pm",
        "content": "Several election monitoring organisations have raised concerns pertaining to the recent Regulation of Election Expenditure Bill, which is being debated in Parliament today (19 Jan.). Accordingly, a collective of election monitoring organisations comprising of Transparency International Sri Lanka (TISL), Peoples Action for Free and Fair Elections (PAFFREL), the Centre for Monitoring Election Violence (CMEV) and Institute for Democratic Reforms and Electoral Studies (IRES) have raised concerns regarding several loopholes in the Bill, emphasizing that it remains inadequate. Despite the group having campaigned for such a law for several years now, issuing a statement, TISL noted that a law being brought to regulate the role of money in election campaigns must be one that prevents undue influence and creates a levelled playing field for all competitors, including novel entrants and underrepresented parties. To be effective, the law should also provide for a robust monitoring and enforcement mechanism by both the authorities and citizens, the statement further read. Thus, they deemed the relevant Bill which was Gazetted on 29 November 2022, and is being debated in Parliament today, inadequate, stating that although it has banned contributions from various parties, it fails to impose any limit on how much funding a candidate, party or independent group can receive from any source, thereby allowing for undue influence. The Bill bans campaign contributions from several parties, including foreign governments, corporate bodies registered outside Sri Lanka, companies with foreign shareholding and anonymous donors. Commenting further on the inadequacies of the Bill, it was highlighted that a sufficient monitoring mechanism has also not been set out within its framework, while it also fails to prevent spending by political parties and third parties, on candidates. Although the Bill foresees the allocation of an authorized amount as the spending limit for a candidate at each election, and requires for candidates to submit audited accounts to the Election Commission, it does not prevent spending by political parties and third parties, on candidates. An effective law would require maintenance and disclosure of separate all accounts of candidates, parties or independent groups to the ECSL, and would also make such information digitally accessible to the public, enabling easy scrutiny, and an opportunity to digitally identify irregularities, TISL stated with regard to what, ideally, should have been done. Thus, the collective called on the government to close the aforementioned loopholes and to engage in a consultative process with the public, as opposed to rushing its passage in Parliament. A weak regulatory system can lead to a further deterioration of peoples trust in politics and the legitimacy of the electoral process, and will not achieve the objectives of introducing such a law, they warned, while reiterating that the introduction of such a law should not be used as a reason to delay the holding of the local government elections.",

In a letter directed to the chairman of the election body, Nimal G.

Pointing out that from a technical point of view, they are not election candidates at the moment, the PAFFREL chief explained that it is natural and most likely for them to become the candidates in the upcoming election. Mr. Hettiarachchi also raised concerns about the possibility of continuing to use these resources and property that belong to the LG bodies until the end of election. Hence, this situation should be controlled forthwith, the election monitoring group noted, adding urging the Election Commission to make the LG secretaries, municipal commissioners and LG commissioners aware of this situation. He also called on the election chief to advise them to initiate necessary measures to prevent the use of resources and property that belong to local government bodies for the promotion of interest of political parties or candidates and to prepare the environment conducive for a free and fair election.",

        "date": "January 19, 2023 06:36 pm",
        "content": "The mayor of Amiens in northern France has released a video requesting that Madonna loan the city a painting from her personal collection, which resembles one lost there during World War I. The 19th-century work, Diane and Endymion by artist Jerome-Martin Langlois, is likely the same one loaned by the Louvre to the Fine Art Museum in Amiens before World War I and which subsequently disappeared, Brigitte Foure said in a video message to the Queen of Pop posted on Facebook. Obviously, we dont dispute in any way the legal acquisition that you made of this work, Foure added. Instead she asked the singer for a loan to exhibit it in 2028, when Amiens hopes to be the years European Capital of Culture. Lending the image would allow the inhabitants to discover this work and enjoy it, the mayor said. The paintings possible provenance was suggested by newspaper Le Figaro in an investigation published this month. Sold at auction for 1.3 million to Madonna in 1989, an art conservator spotted the monumental work in a photo of her home published in the magazine Paris Match. It represents a mythological scene of the bare-breasted goddess Diana approaching the shepherd Endymion. Im not certain that its the actual painting, but even if a copy, its extremely similar to the work and Id like the people of Amiens to be able to see it again, Foure said. Langlois original work was ordered in 1817 to decorate the royal Versailles palace outside Paris, said Francois Seguin, interim director of the Picardie Museum -- formerly Amiens Fine Art Museum. It was loaned by Paris Louvre Museum to the northern city from 1872, until being declared missing after World War I. Madonnas painting is almost certainly a copy, most likely by the artist himself, the Louvre said when it exhibited the painting in 1988. Her version lacks the artists signature, the date of the work and his stamp, and is around 3 centimetres (one inch) smaller than the original, making it not very likely that its the same work, expert Seguin said. Nevertheless, its the only evidence of the work that was lost, he added. Source  AFP -Agencies",

President Wickremesinghe said the past is useful to look at, however, everyone should live in the present and look to the future. Speaking further President Wickremesinghe stated that each religion will try and must preach its essence to everyone, both believers and nonbelievers. But preaching to nonbelievers doesnt mean that they are the enemies of any religion.

        "date": "January 19, 2023 09:56 pm",
        "content": "Former President Maithripala Sirisena today (19 Jan.) announced his plans to establish a public fund, in order to collect the Rs. 100 million he was ordered to pay as compensation in relation to the Easter Sunday Attacks of 2019. Speaking at a press conference today, Sirisena explained that he is unable to pay the ordered sum of Rs. 100 million and therefore decided to collect the sum of money from the public. I dont have the financial stability to pay Rs. 100 million. I dont even own a motorcycle. I will have to collect money from all over the country because if the money isnt paid, I will be jailed, the former Head of State said. Although we are siblings, I play no part in Dudley Sirisenas businesses. There are 11 of us in our family. My father had five acres of paddy fields, and three acres of land. The five paddy fields are being shared amongst my sisters, while I grew mangoes in the remaining acres of land. I have no other source of income, Sirisena emphasised. Earlier this week, Sirisena mentioned that he was abroad and receiving treatment at a hospital in Singapore, at the time of the Easter Sunday attacks, adding that none of the officials of the security forces notified him regarding the matter, despite receiving intelligence information in advance. Nearly 85 pages of this judgment include that although the officials had received information, the president had not been informed in any way regarding the matter, Mr. Sirisena claimed. The compensation was ordered to be paid with regard to a violation of fundamental human rights, he said, pointing out that the Supreme Courts judgment has mentioned that if the officials appointed by the President committed any mistake, the President should also take responsibility for the mistakes committed by the said officials. The IGP is appointed by the President and the Defense Secretary is appointed by the President, but the Director of Intelligence Service is appointed by the IGP, not the President. However, I have also been ordered to pay Rs. 100 million compensation, that I was also responsible for the non-fulfilment of the responsibilities by them. On 12 January, the Supreme Court found the former President, along with former Defence Secretary Hemasiri Fernando, former IGP Pujith Jayasundara, former National Intelligence Chief Sisira Mendis and former Chief of State Intelligence Nilantha Jayawardena in violation of the Fundamental Rights of petitioners, by failing to take action to prevent the Easter Sunday attacks despite receiving sufficient intelligence information. Accordingly, the Supreme Court ordered Sirisena to pay Rs. 100 million in compensation to the petitioners, former IGP Pujith Jayasundara and the former State Intelligence Service (SIS) Director Nilantha Jayawardena were each ordered to pay Rs. 75 million, former Defense Secretary Hemasiri Fernando was ordered to pay Rs. 50 million and former National Intelligence Director Sisira Mendis was ordered to pay Rs. 10 million from their personal money.",

        "content": "Accepting cash deposits for the upcoming Local Government (LG) election ends at 12.00 p.m. today (Jan. 20). Several political parties and independent groups had placed their cash deposits for the LG election as of yesterday (Jan. 19), since the process began on January 18. Meanwhile, 10 political parties handed over the nominations for the upcoming LG election yesterday. Accepting nominations will end at 12.00 noon on Saturday (Jan. 21). National Peoples Power (NPP) has handed over their nominations for Matale, Puttlam, Anuradhapura, Polonnaruwa, Badulla, Monaragala and Ratnapura districts so far. In addition, Nidahas Janatha Sandhanaya (Peoples Freedom Alliance), United National Freedom Front, Tamil Makkal Viduthalai Pulikal, Jana Setha Peramuna, Sri Lanka Muslim Congress and United Socialist Party and several other parties have handed over the nominations for a number of LG institutions, said the Election Commission. Meanwhile, the election monitoring organizations emphasize that nearly 15 complaints in relation to the upcoming LG election have been received so far since the day accepting cash deposits for the LG election commenced. Executive Director of the Peoples Action for Free  Fair Elections (PAFFREL) Rohana Hettiarachchi stated that a considerable number of complaints regarding the misuse of public property have been received to date. Furthermore, he points out that passing the Regulation of Election Expenditure Bill can affect the upcoming LG election despite remarks of political representatives stating otherwise. The Regulation of Election Expenditure Bill was passed in Parliament yesterday, by a majority of 61 votes, with a total of 97 votes in its favour, and 36 against. MP Anura Kumara Dissanayake, who spoke to the media after the vote, claimed that the government is trying to delay the election by passing the relevant bill. However, Minister Prasanna Ranatunga stated that the government has no intention postpone the election through this bill. State Minister Chamara Sampath Dasanayake said that the comments made by the political groups in the opposition against the Regulation of Election Expenditure Bill are baseless.",

        "date": "January 20, 2023 01:59 pm",
        "content": "Securing additional funds for an election at a time state revenue is battered by the economic crisis will be extremely challenging to the Treasury, Secretary to the Finance Ministry informed the Supreme Court. Mr. Mahinda Siriwardana conveyed this to the Supreme Court in an affidavit submitted pertaining to a writ application filed by retired Army Colonel W.M.R. Wijesundara. The petition, citing the prevailing economic crisis, has sought a court order to defer the local government election. In his affidavit, the finance secretary pointed out that the countrys export revenues dropped by 8.2 percent in 2021 due to the Covid-19 outbreak and as a result, the budget deficit increased by 11.6 percent in that year. Explaining that the government spends a sum of Rs. 90 billion on state sector salary payments, Rs. 28 billion each for Samurdhi allowances and importing essential items such as medicines and fertilizer, Siriwardana explained that the government is struggling to source funds to fulfill these essential needs of the public. In addition, the government had to incur a sum of Rs. 114 billion to settle interest payments and Rs. 169 billion for debt payments in the year 2022, Siriwardana added. He also recalled the decision taken by the government recently to delay the salary payments for executive-grade employees in the state sector by a few days due to the prevailing situation. Maintaining political stability in the country is of extreme importance at the moment, as Sri Lanka is trying to restore economic stability with the support of the International Monetary Fund, Siriwardana added. Siriwardana has also underscored that managing state funds is facing a critical situation due to the limited inflow of money from external and internal sources. Election expenditure will gravely affect the fiscal condition of the country and securing funds for the election will be extremely challenging for the Treasury, he pointed out further.",

        "date": "January 20, 2023 03:16 pm",
        "content": "A cane toad so giant wildlife officers thought it was fake has been found in a north Australian rainforest. The monster specimen is six times bigger than the average toad, weighs 2.7kg, and could break a world record. Dubbed Toadzilla, the animal was quickly placed in a container and removed from the wild. Toads - which were first introduced to Australia in 1935 - are one of the countrys most damaging pests and are now estimated to number in the hundreds of millions. When park ranger Kylee Gray first spotted the massive amphibian while out on patrol in Queensland, she couldnt believe her eyes. Ive never seen anything so big, she told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. It looked almost like a football with legs. We dubbed it Toadzilla. Her team quickly captured Toadzilla - believed to be a female - and returned to base to weigh her. They knew she would be heavy, but were surprised to find she could set a new world record. The current Guinness World Record for the largest toad - 2.65kg - was set by a pet toad in Sweden named Prinsen in 1991. Ms Gray says this giant specimen likely bulked out on a diet of insects, reptiles and small mammals. A cane toad that size will eat anything it can fit into its mouth, she said. Toads have no natural predators in Australia and the poisonous species have wrought havoc on native animal populations. Ms Gray isnt sure how old Toadzilla was - the species can live up to 15 years in the wild - but believes she has been around a long time. Toadzilla has since been euthanised, as is standard practice in Australia for the pests, and will be donated to the Queensland Museum. Source - BBC -Agencies",
