        "title": "South Korean president apologizes, saying he wont shirk responsibility for attempt at martial law",
        "date": "December 7, 2024 08:25 am",
        "content": "South Koreas president apologized Saturday for public anxiety caused by his short-lived attempt to impose martial law earlier this week hours ahead of a parliamentary vote on impeaching him. Yoon said in a brief televised address Saturday morning he wont shirk legal or political responsibility for the declaration and promised not to make another attempt to impose it. He said he would leave it to his conservative political party to chart a course through the countrys political turmoil, including matters related to my term in office. South Korean lawmakers are set to vote later Saturday on impeaching President Yoon Suk Yeol over his short-lived attempt to impose martial law, as protests grew nationwide calling for his removal. It wasnt immediately clear whether the motion submitted by opposition lawmakers would get the two-thirds majority required for Yoon to be impeached. But it appeared more likely after the leader of Yoons own party on Friday called for suspending his constitutional powers, describing him as unfit to hold the office and capable of taking more extreme action, including renewed attempts to impose martial law. Impeaching Yoon would require support from 200 of the National Assemblys 300 members. The opposition parties that jointly brought the impeachment motion have 192 seats combined. That means they would need at least eight votes from Yoons People Power Party. On Wednesday, 18 members of the PPP joined a vote that unanimously canceled martial law 190-0 less than three hours after Yoon declared the measure on television, calling the opposition-controlled parliament a den of criminals bogging down state affairs. The vote took place as hundreds of heavily-armed troops encircled the National Assembly in an attempt to disrupt the vote and possibly to detain key politicians. Parliament said Saturday that it would meet at 5 p.m. It will first vote on a bill appointing a special prosecutor to investigate influence peddling allegations surrounding Yoons wife, and then on impeaching Yoon. The turmoil resulting from Yoons bizarre and poorly-thought-out stunt has paralyzed South Korean politics and sparked alarm among key diplomatic partners, including neighboring Japan and Seouls top ally the United States, as one of the strongest democracies in Asia faces a political crisis that could unseat its leader. Opposition lawmakers claim that Yoons martial law declaration amounted to a self-coup and drafted the impeachment motion around rebellion charges. The PPP decided to oppose impeachment at a lawmakers meeting, despite pleas by its leader Han Dong-hun, who isnt a lawmaker and has no vote. Following a party meeting on Friday, Han stressed the need to suspend Yoons presidential duties and power swiftly, saying he could potentially put the Republic of Korea and its citizens in great danger. Han said he had received intelligence that during the brief period of martial law Yoon ordered the countrys defense counterintelligence commander to arrest and detain unspecified key politicians based on accusations of anti-state activities. Hong Jang-won, first deputy director of South Koreas National Intelligence Service, later told lawmakers in a closed-door briefing that Yoon called after imposing martial law and ordered him to help the defense counterintelligence unit to detain key politicians. The targeted politicians included Han, opposition leader Lee Jae-myung and National Assembly speaker Woo Won Shik, according to Kim Byung-kee, one of the lawmakers who attended the meeting. The Defense Ministry said it had suspended the defense counterintelligence commander, Yeo In-hyung, who Han alleged had received orders from Yoon to detain the politicians. The ministry also suspended Lee Jin-woo, commander of the capital defense command, and Kwak Jong-geun, commander of the special warfare command, over their involvement in enforcing martial law. Former Defense Minister Kim Yong Hyun, who has been accused of recommending Yoon to enforce martial law, has been placed under a travel ban and faces an investigation by prosecutors over rebellion charges. Vice Defense Minister Kim Seon Ho, who became acting defense minister after Yoon accepted Kim Yong Hyuns resignation on Thursday, has testified to parliament that it was Kim Yong Hyun who ordered troops to be deployed to the National Assembly after Yoon imposed martial law.

        "title": "Syrian rebels seize fourth city, close in on Homs in threat to Assads rule",
        "date": "December 7, 2024 10:03 am",
        "content": "Syrian rebels said they seized control of the southern city of Daraa on Saturday, the birthplace of a 2011 uprising against President Bashar al-Assad and the fourth city his forces have lost in a week. Rebel sources said the military agreed to make an orderly withdrawal from Daraa under a deal giving army officials safe passage to the capital Damascus, about 100 km (60 miles) north. Social media videos showed rebels on motorcycles and others mingling with residents on the streets. People fired shots into the air at the citys main square in celebration, according to the videos. There was no immediate comment from the military or Assads government, and Reuters could not independently verify the rebels claim. With the fall of Daraa, Assads forces have surrendered four important centres to the insurgents in a week. Daraa, which had a population of more than 100,000 before the civil war began 13 years ago, holds symbolic importance as the cradle of the uprising. It is the capital of a province of about 1 million people, bordering Jordan. Daraas seizure followed the rebels claim late on Friday that they had advanced to the edge of the central city of Homs, a key crossroads between the capital and the Mediterranean coast. Capturing Homs would cut off Damascus from the coastal stronghold of Assads minority Alawite sect, and from a naval base and air base of his Russian allies there. Our forces have liberated the last village on the outskirts of the city of Homs and are now on its walls, the Syrian faction leading the sweeping assault said on the Telegram messaging app. A coalition of rebel factions that include the Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) made a last call on forces loyal to Assads government in Homs to defect. Ahead of the rebel advance, thousands of people fled Homs towards the coastal regions of Latakia and Tartus, strongholds of the government, residents and witnesses said. A U.S.-backed alliance led by Syrian Kurdish fighters captured Deir el-Zor, the governments main foothold in the vast eastern desert, on Friday, three Syrian sources told Reuters. The rebels seized Aleppo and Hama in the northwest and centre earlier in the lightning offensive that began on Nov. 27. In another ominous sign for Assad in the east, the Syrian Kurdish force said Islamic State - a jihadist group that imposed martial law under its harsh rule before its defeat by a U.S.-led coalition in 2017 - had taken control of some areas in eastern Syria. Aron Lund, a fellow at think-tank Century Foundation, said Assads government was fighting for their lives at this point. It was possible the government could hold Homs, but given the speed at which things have moved so far, I wouldnt count on it, he said on Friday. Syrian state TV reported Russian-Syrian airstrikes targeting rebel headquarters in the countryside of Hama, Idlib and Aleppo killed at least 200 insurgents on Friday, citing the Russian Coordination Centre in Syria. A Syrian army source said Iran-backed Hezbollah forces were positioned to bolster government defences in and near Homs. Syrian state media reported dozens of rebels were killed in the Homs countryside on Friday in an operation by Syrian and Russian air forces, artillery, missiles and armoured vehicles. Capturing Homs would solidify a chain of powerful positions under the Islamic insurgents control from Aleppo on the Turkish border in the north to Daraa on the Jordanian border to the south. Gaining Homs would also increase the rebels chances of isolating the seat of Assads regime in Damascus with the ability to block the route northwest from the capital to the sea. As the rebels pressed their offensive, Russia and Jordan on Friday urged their nationals to leave Syria. After years locked behind frozen front lines, rebel forces have burst out of their northwestern Idlib bastion to achieve the swiftest battlefield advance by either side since a street uprising against Assad mushroomed into civil war 13 years ago. Syrias conflict killed more than 305,000 people between 2011 and 2021, the United Nations Human Rights Office said in 2022. Assad regained control of most of Syria after key allies - Russia, Iran and Lebanons Hezbollah - came to his rescue. But all have recently been weakened and diverted by other crises, giving Sunni Muslim militants a window to fight back. Tehran, which has been focussed on tensions with arch-foe Israel since the Gaza war began last year, began to evacuate its military officials and personnel from Syria on Friday, a sign of Irans inability to keep Assad in power, the New York Times reported, citing regional officials and three Iranian officials. The head of the main rebel faction HTS, Abu Mohammed Al-Golani, vowed in a separate interview with the New York Times published on Friday that the insurgents could end Assads rule. This operation broke the enemy, he said of the rebels lightning offensive. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "content": "Production of the new HBO TV series of Harry Potter will begin in summer 2025 at a UK studio, it has been announced. The programme will be filmed at Warner Bros Studios Leavesden in Hertfordshire, which is where the eight Harry Potter movies were also shot. Warner Bros streaming service Max said the new, decade-long series would be a faithful adaptation of the iconic books by author JK Rowling. It will feature a brand new cast, with 32,000 children having auditioned for the lead roles following an open casting call in September, according to HBO. On Thursday, Max posted to X: Wands at the ready. The upcoming HBO Original Series, HarryPotter, will be filming at Warner Bros. Studios Leavesden with production beginning in Summer 2025 and coming to Max. Warner Bros is the production company behind the original films, starring Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint. Grint, who was 12, applied for the role after seeing a Newsround report about the open casting. This time the TV casting call stipulated that applicants must be residents of the UK or Ireland aged between nine and 11 by April 2025. HBO said the casting team had been reviewing up to 1,000 tapes per day after thousands of children applied. The TV series was announced in 2023, with Max saying at the time that it would lead a new generation of fandom, full of the fantastic detail, much loved characters and dramatic locations that Harry Potter fans have loved for over 25 years. It is expected that there will be seven series of the show, each season adapting one of the Harry Potter books by JK Rowling. Each season will be authentic to the original books and bring Harry Potter and these incredible adventures to new audiences around the world, added Max. Francesca Gardiner and Mark Mylod, who both worked on acclaimed drama Succession, were confirmed as executive producers of the series earlier in the year. The cast of beloved characters including Harry Potter, Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger - played by Radcliffe, Grint and Watson, respectively - will be announced at a later date.

        "date": "December 7, 2024 02:09 pm",
        "content": "Numerous parties have voiced strong opposition to the Ceylon Electricity Boards (CEB) recent proposal to the Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL) to maintain the existing electricity tariffs without any revision for the next six months. Critics argue that authorities must justify why the public is not benefiting from the increased hydroelectric power generation, which has surged following heavy rainfall across the country. Earlier this year, electricity tariffs were reduced twice under the policy of revising rates quarterlyby 21.9 in March and 22.5 in July. Although another revision was due in October, it was postponed to December. The PUCSL recently rejected a CEB proposal to reduce rates by 6 to 11, asserting that a more significant reduction was possible given current conditions. The CEBs latest proposal suggests no reductions for the next six months, citing that any possible adjustment would be as minimal as 1.02. This decision has sparked public discontent, especially since hydroelectricity production has risen to 56 as of yesterday, with reservoir levels replenished after the heavy rains. However, the PUCSL has announced that it will issue its decision regarding the CEBs proposal by the third week of January.",

        "date": "December 7, 2024 06:31 pm",
        "content": "A South Korean legislative push to impeach President Yoon Suk Yeol over his short-lived imposition of martial law fell through on Saturday after most lawmakers from his conservative governing party boycotted the vote. The defeat of the motion is expected to intensify public protests calling for Yoons ouster and deepen political chaos in South Korea, with a survey suggesting a majority of South Koreans support the presidents impeachment. Yoons martial law declaration drew criticism from his own ruling conservative party, but it is also determined to oppose Yoons impeachment apparently because it fears losing the presidency to liberals. Impeaching Yoon required support from two-thirds of the National Assembly, or 200 of its 300 members. The opposition parties who brought the impeachment motion had 192 seats, but only three lawmakers from PPP participated in the vote. The motion was scrapped without ballot counting because the number of votes didnt reach 200. The likely defeat of the motion is expected to intensify public protests calling for Yoons ouster and deepen political chaos in South Korea, with a survey suggesting a majority of South Koreans support the presidents impeachment. Yoons martial law declaration drew criticism from his own ruling conservative party, but it is also determined to oppose Yoons impeachment apparently because it fears losing presidency to liberals. Impeaching Yoon would require support from two-thirds of the National Assembly, or 200 of its 300 members. The opposition parties who brought the impeachment motion have 192 seats, meaning they need at least eight additional votes from Yoons People Power Party. The opposition-controlled parliament began a vote earlier Saturday, but only three lawmakers from PPP took part with opposition members. If the number of lawmakers who cast ballots doesnt reach 200, the motion will be scrapped at midnight without the ballot counting, according to the National Assembly. Opposition parties could submit a new impeachment motion after a new parliamentary session opens next Wednesday. There are worries that Yoon wont be able to serve out his remaining 2 12 years in office because his leadership took a huge hit. Many experts say some ruling party lawmakers could eventually join opposition parties efforts to impeach Yoon if public demands for it grow further. If Yoon is impeached, his powers will be suspended until the Constitutional Court decides whether to remove him from office. If he is removed, an election to replace him must take place within 60 days. National Assembly Speaker Woo Won Shik urged ruling party members to return to the chamber to participate in the vote, stressing that it was closely watched by the nation and also the world. Dont make a shameful judgment and please vote based on your convictions, Woo said. Democratic Party leaders visited a hall on the floor below the main chamber where PPP lawmakers were gathered, attempting to persuade them to vote. After being blocked from entering, they angrily accused the conservatives leadership of preventing its lawmakers from voting freely. Earlier Saturday, Yoon issued a public apology over the martial law decree, saying he wont shirk legal or political responsibility for the declaration and promising not to make another attempt to impose martial law. He said would leave it to his party to chart a course through the countrys political turmoil, including matters related to my term in office. The declaration of this martial law was made out of my desperation. But in the course of its implementation, it caused anxiety and inconveniences to the public. I feel very sorry over that and truly apologize to the people who must have been shocked a lot, Yoon said. Since taking office in 2022, Yoon has struggled to push his agenda through an opposition-controlled parliament and grappled with low approval ratings amid scandals involving himself and his wife. In his martial law announcement on Tuesday night, Yoon called parliament a den of criminals bogging down state affairs and vowed to eliminate shameless North Korea followers and anti-state forces. The turmoil resulting from Yoons bizarre and poorly-thought-out stunt has paralyzed South Korean politics and sparked alarm among key diplomatic partners like the U.S. and Japan. Tuesday night saw special forces troops encircling the parliament building and army helicopters hovering over it, but the military withdrew after the National Assembly unanimously voted to overturn the decree, forcing Yoon to lift it before daybreak Wednesday. The declaration of martial law was the first of its kind in more than 40 years in South Korea. Eighteen lawmakers from the ruling party voted to reject Yoons martial law decree along with opposition lawmakers. Yoons speech fueled speculation that he and his party may push for a constitutional amendment to shorten his term, instead of accepting impeachment, as a way to ease public anger over the marital law and facilitate Yoons early exit from office. Lee Jae-myung, the leader of the main liberal opposition Democratic Party, told reporters that Yoons speech was greatly disappointing and that the only way forward is his immediate resignation or impeachment. His party called Yoons martial law unconstitutional, illegal rebellion or coup. The passage of Yoons impeachment motion appeared more likely Friday when the chair of Yoons party called for his removal on Friday, but the party remained formally opposed to impeachment. On Saturday, tens of thousands of people densely packed several blocks of roads leading up to the National Assembly, waving banners, shouting slogans and dancing and singing along to K-pop songs with lyrics changed to call for Yoons ouster. Protesters also gathered in front of PPPs headquarters near the Assembly, angrily shouting for its lawmakers to vote to impeach Yoon. A smaller crowd of Yoons supporters, which still seemed to be in the thousands, rallied in separate streets in Seoul, decrying the impeachment attempt they saw as unconstitutional. Lawmakers on Saturday first voted on a bill appointing a special prosecutor to investigate stock price manipulation allegations surrounding Yoons wife. Some lawmakers from Yoons party were seen leaving the hall after that vote, triggering angry shouts from opposition lawmakers. On Friday, PPP chair Han Dong-hun, who criticized Yoons martial law declaration, said he had received intelligence that during the brief period of martial law Yoon ordered the countrys defense counterintelligence commander to arrest and detain unspecified key politicians based on accusations of anti-state activities. Hong Jang-won, first deputy director of South Koreas National Intelligence Service, told lawmakers in a closed-door briefing Friday that Yoon had ordered him to help the defense counterintelligence unit to detain key politicians. The targeted politicians included Han, Lee and Woo, according to Kim Byung-kee, one of the lawmakers who attended the meeting. The Defense Ministry said Friday it suspended three military commanders including the head of the defense counterintelligence unit over their involvement in enforcing martial law. Vice Defense Minister Kim Seon Ho has told parliament that Defense Minister Kim Yong Hyun ordered the deployment of troops to the National Assembly after Yoon imposed martial law. Opposition parties accused Kim of recommending to Yoon to enforce martial law. Kim resigned Thursday, and prosecutors imposed an overseas travel ban on him. Source: AP --Agencies",

        "content": "View this post on Instagram A post shared by BBC Earth (bbcearth) Along the Buttala-Kataragama road in Sri Lanka, a majestic wild elephant, believed to be over 40 years old, performs the duties of a toll collector. Known to locals as Raja, meaning king, the elephant stands roadside but quickly seizes upon a vehicle coming from either direction and immediately requests food. The jumbo needs to be served. Raja is patient in his approach. He understands that getting angry will only drive the people away. Hence, after stopping the vehicles, Raja calmly uses his massive trunk to poke the drivers for food, who after some negotiation, albeit failed, offer the food items to him. It is an efficient business -- one that only Raja appears to be the master of. What started as an innocuous food search by Raja has now turned into a full-fledged tradition. Many motorists buy fruits including bananas in advance at wayside little stalls that dot the road from Lunugamvehera to Sella Kataragama, anticipating an encounter with the elephants, particularly Raja. Notably, the Buttala-Kataragama road is a major linkway that connects Sri Lankas west coast with the southeast coast. With wild untamed jungle on either side, the road is popular among the locals as well as foreigners who seek the thrill of engaging with nature in its visceral glory. Despite causing significant hassle on the road by blocking the vehicles, the locals treat Raja with respect and give in to his authoritarian tax-collection policy. Social media reacts Social media users have given their seal of approval to Raja to continue his bureaucratic duties and chomp on bananas and other fruits. This is where and how l want my tax to be paid, said one user, while another added: For people saying its dangerous, I mean whos gonna stop him? Its called hustle! A third added: These elephants are true businessmen. Look how patiently hes dealing with the drivers. Source: NDTV --Agencies",

        "date": "December 8, 2024 09:45 am",
        "content": "South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeols former defence minister was arrested on Sunday over his alleged role in Yoons declaration of martial law last week, prosecutors said. Yoon survived an impeachment vote in the opposition-led parliament late on Saturday, prompted by Tuesdays short-lived attempt to impose martial law, but the leader of his own party said the president would effectively be excluded from his duties before eventually stepping down. The leader of Yoons People Power Party, Han Dong-hoon, in a joint press conference with the prime minister, said on Sunday that Yoon will not be involved in foreign and other state affairs before his early resignation. Ex-Defence Minister Kim Yong-hyun, who stepped down on Wednesday after Yoon rescinded martial law, was seen as a central figure in the debacle. He had proposed martial law to the president, according to a senior military official and the impeachment filings. The prosecutions special investigative team arrested Kim on Sunday and seized his mobile phone, it said in a brief statement to reporters. Before the arrest, investigators questioned Kim, who voluntarily appeared at the Seoul Central District Prosecutors Office around 1:30 a.m. on Sunday (1630 GMT on Saturday), Yonhap news agency reported. Three minority opposition parties filed a complaint with the prosecution against Yoon, Kim and martial law commander Park An-su, accusing them of insurrection. If convicted, the crime of leading an insurrection is punishable by death or life imprisonment, with or without prison labour. Opposition lawmakers allege Yoon mobilised military forces to block a vote by lawmakers seeking to nullify what they said was an unconstitutional martial law decree. The national police raided Kims office on Sunday as part of an investigation into claims of treason against Yoon and top ministers, Yonhap said. Hours before Saturdays impeachment vote, Yoon addressed the nation in a televised speech to apologise for his martial law decree, saying he would put his fate in the hands of his party. Han said the comments were effectively a promise to leave office early, adding that the ruling party would consult with the prime minister to manage state affairs. Prime Minister Han Duck-soo said on Sunday the cabinet would do its best to maintain trust with our allies, referring to the United States and Japan. Yoon shocked the nation on Tuesday night when he gave the military sweeping emergency powers to root out what he called anti-state forces and obstructionist political opponents. He rescinded the order six hours later, after parliament defied military and police cordons to vote unanimously against the decree. Yoons martial law declaration plunged South Korea, Asias fourth-largest economy and a key U.S. military ally, into its greatest political crisis in decades, threatening to shatter the countrys reputation as a democratic success story.

        "date": "December 8, 2024 10:33 am",
        "content": "Syrian President Bashar al-Assad boarded a plane and left Damascus for an unknown destination on Sunday, two senior army officers told Reuters, as rebels said they had entered the capital with no sign of army deployments. Thousands in cars and on foot congregated at a main square in Damascus waving and chanting Freedom, witnesses said. The tyrant Bashar al-Assad has fled and we declare the city of Damascus free, the rebel factions said on Telegram, adding that after 50 years of oppression under Baath rule, and 13 years of crimes and tyranny and (forced) displacement... we announce today the end of this dark period and the start of a new era for Syria. We celebrate with the Syrian people the news of freeing our prisoners and releasing their chains and announcing the end of the era of injustice in Sednaya prison, said the rebels. Sednaya is a large military prison on the outskirts of Damascus where the Syrian government detained thousands. The leader of Syrian rebel group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, Abu Mohammed al-Jolani, ordered forces Sunday not to approach official institutions in Damascus, saying they would remain under the prime minister until they are officially handed over. To all military forces in the city of Damascus, it is strictly forbidden to approach public institutions, which will remain under the supervision of the former prime minister until they are officially handed over, Jolani said in a statement on Telegram, using his real name Ahmed al-Sharaa instead of his nom de guerre, and adding: It is forbidden to shoot into the air. In rural areas southwest of the capital, local youths and former rebels took advantage of the loss of authority to come to the streets in acts of defiance against the Assad familys authoritarian rule. Syrian rebels capture key city of Homs Syrian rebels announced they gained full control over the key city of Homs early on Sunday after only a day of fighting, leaving President Bashar al-Assads 24-year rule dangling by a thread as insurgents marched on Damascus. Thousands of Homs residents poured onto the streets after the army withdrew from the central city, dancing and chanting Assad is gone, Homs is free and Long live Syria and down with Bashar al-Assad. Rebels fired into the air in celebration, and youths tore down posters of the Syrian president, whose territorial control has collapsed in a dizzying week-long retreat by the military. The fall of Homs gives the insurgents control over Syrias strategic heartland and a key highway crossroads, severing Damascus from the coastal region that is the stronghold of Assads Alawite sect and where his Russian allies have a naval base and air base. Homs capture is also a powerful symbol of the rebel movements dramatic comeback in the 13-year-old conflict. Swathes of Homs were destroyed by gruelling siege warfare between the rebels and the army years ago. The fighting ground down the insurgents, who were forced out. Hayat Tahrir al-Sham commander Abu Mohammed al-Golani, the main rebel leader, called the capture of Homs a historic moment and urged fighters not to harm those who drop their arms. Rebels freed thousands of detainees from the city prison. Security forces left in haste after burning their documents. Residents of numerous Damascus districts turned out to protest Assad on Saturday evening, and security forces were either unwilling or unable to clamp down. Syrian rebel commander Hassan Abdul Ghani said in a statement early Sunday that operations were ongoing to completely liberate the countryside around Damascus and rebel forces were looking toward the capital.

        "date": "December 8, 2024 02:18 pm",
        "content": "A Sri Lankan national believed to be the head of the criminal gang known as Ava Group, based in Northern Sri Lanka, has been arrested in Canada. Canadian media reported that Prasanna Nallalingam, 32, who also goes by the name Ajanthan Subramaniyam, is facing extradition to France to face murder charges after being arrested in Toronto this spring. The extradition of Nallalingam is being sought in connection with the alleged gang killing of Abiraman Balakirishnan and attempted murder of another man in September 2022 in France, Canadas Department of Justice confirmed. Subramaniyam, is believed to be the leader of a group known as AAVA, an outlaw motorcycle gang active in the northern province of Sri Lanka. The filings state the attack targeted a group known to be rivals of AAVA, the LC Boys, foreign media reported. According to French media reports, the two groups were engaged in a multi-year conflict over control of La Courneuve, a commune located in the northern suburbs of Paris. Concealing their faces and armed with sabres, machetes and knives, Nallalingam and five associates are alleged to have attacked two occupants of a vehicle in La Courneuve on Sept. 21, 2022. According to the filings, Nallalingam, 32, was not only allegedly involved in the attack on Balakirishnan and the second man, but planned and instigated it. The two victims were found in agony, French court filings read; Balakirishnan died of his wounds, while the second man survived. At the time of the attack, Nallalingam was wanted in Sri Lanka for the March 2021 killing of Sivakumaran Jeewarathna. According to court filings, he escaped the country not long after, sparking Interpol to issue an international arrest warrant. Nallalingam was also already known to French authorities at the time  in 2019, court documents show he was sentenced to a six-month suspended prison sentence for acts of violence, and, in 2021, received a sentence of three years for his participation in an organized raid on a restaurant in Paris, reportedly carried out in retaliation for a prior attack on an AAVA member. Nallalingam entered Canada from the United States in December 2022. According to the filings, he was able to do so by providing a fraudulent name at an unauthorized checkpoint on Roxham Road in Quebec. It is not clear how Nallalingam entered the U.S. Nallalingam awaited a decision on that claim for the next year, during which French authorities joined Interpol in issuing a warrant for his arrest. Considering that (Nallalingam) is strongly suspected of having participated in acts of murder (and) attempted murder committed by an organized gang; That this information related to acts punishable by life imprisonment sentences; That these are acts of a particularly serious nature committed on a public highway; That there is a significant number of protagonists and that (Nallalingam) currently appears to be a fugitive abroad; that he is already being investigated by the Sri Lankan authorities for murder; In view of these elements, it appears necessary and responsible to issue an arrest warrant, the French warrant reads. It wasnt until May of this year that Nallalingam was arrested by the Canada Border Services Agency, assisted by the Toronto Police Service, after failing to appear for a refugee admissibility hearing. Upon taking him into custody, authorities ran the fingerprints provided in his claim against the set on file with Interpol  it was a match. When reached for comment, Allan Lobel, legal counsel for Nallalingam, declined to comment on the proceedings. Nallalingam is currently in custody awaiting a decision on the proposed extradition. His hearing is scheduled for May 2025. --With agencies inputs",

        "date": "December 8, 2024 03:45 pm",
        "content": "The Syrian government collapsed early Sunday, falling to a lightning rebel offensive that seized control of the capital of Damascus and sent crowds into the streets to celebrate the end of the Assad familys 50 years of iron rule. Syrian state television aired a video statement by a group of men saying that President Bashar Assad had been overthrown and all prisoners had been set free. The man who read the statement said the opposition group, known as the Operations Room to Conquer Damascus, called on all rebel fighters and citizens to preserve the institutions of the free Syrian state. The statement emerged hours after the head of a Syrian opposition war monitor said Assad had left the country for an undisclosed location, fleeing ahead of insurgents who said they had entered Damascus following a remarkably swift advance across the country. Many of the capitals residents were in disbelief at the speed at which Assad lost his hold on the country after nearly 14 years of civil war that killed hundreds of thousands of people, displaced half the countrys prewar population of 23 million and drew in several foreign powers. Celebrations erupt across the capital As daylight broke over Damascus, crowds gathered to pray in the citys mosques and to celebrate in the squares, chanting God is great. People also chanted anti-Assad slogans and honked car horns. Teen boys picked up weapons that had apparently been discarded by security forces and fired them in the air. Revelers filled Umayyad Square in the city center, where the Defense Ministry is located. Men fired celebratory gunshots into the air and some waved the three-starred Syrian flag that predates the Assad government and was adopted by the revolutionaries. A few kilometers (miles) away, Syrians stormed the presidential palace, tearing up portraits of the toppled president. Soldiers and police officers left their posts and fled, and looters broke into the Defense Ministry. Videos from Damascus showed families wandering into the presidential palace, with some emerging carrying stacks of plates and other household items. I did not sleep last night, and I refused to sleep until I heard the news of his fall, said Mohammed Amer Al-Oulabi, 44, who works in the electricity sector. From Idlib to Damascus, it only took them (the opposition forces) a few days, thank God. May God bless them, the heroic lions who made us proud. Syrias al-Watan newspaper, which was historically pro-government, wrote: We are facing a new page for Syria. We thank God for not shedding more blood. We believe and trust that Syria will be for all Syrians. The newspaper added that media workers should not be blamed for publishing government statements in the past. We only carried out the instructions and published the news they sent us, it said. It quickly became clear now that it was false. A statement from the Alawite sect  to which Assad belongs and which has formed the core of his base  called on young Syrians to be calm, rational and prudent and not to be dragged into what tears apart the unity of our country. Assads whereabouts are unknown Syrian Prime Minister Mohammed Ghazi Jalali said in a video statement that the government was ready to extend its hand to the opposition and turn its functions over to a transitional government. He later told Saudi television network Al Arabiya that he does not know where Assad and the defense minister are. He said he lost communication with Assad late Saturday. Rami Abdurrahman of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights told The Associated Press that Assad took a flight Sunday from Damascus. A senior diplomat from the United Arab Emirates, which had sought to rehabilitate Assads image and has welcomed high-profile exiles in recent years, declined to comment on his whereabouts when asked by reporters at a conference in Bahrain. Anwar Gargash said Assads destination at this point is a footnote in history, comparing it to the long exile of German Kaiser Wilhelm II after World War I. Assad has been accused of war crimes and crimes against humanity during the war, including a 2013 chemical weapons attack on the outskirts of the capital. There was no immediate comment from Iran, which had been Assads staunchest supporter. The Iranian Embassy in Damascus was ransacked after apparently having been abandoned. AP footage showed broken windows and documents scattered in the entryway. Entry into Damascus caps lightning advance Opposition forces had not reached Damascus since 2018, when Syrian troops recaptured areas on the outskirts of the capital following a yearslong siege. The night before, opposition forces took the central city of Homs, Syrias third largest, as government forces abandoned it. The city stands at an important intersection between Damascus, the capital, and Syrias coastal provinces of Latakia and Tartus  the Syrian leaders base of support and home to a Russian strategic naval base. The rebels had already seized the cities of Aleppo and Hama, as well as large parts of the south, in a fast-moving offensive that began Nov. 27. The advances in the past week were by far the largest in recent years by opposition factions, led by a group that has its origins in al-Qaida and is considered a terrorist organization by the United States and the United Nations. In their push to overthrow Assads government, the insurgents, led by the Hayat Tahrir al-Sham group, or HTS, have met little resistance from the Syrian army. Calls for an orderly transition as it remains unclear what comes next HTS set up a salvation government in 2017 to administer a large region in northwestern Syria under its control. In recent years, HTS leader Abu Mohammed al-Golani has sought to remake the groups image, cutting ties with al-Qaida, ditching hard-line officials and vowing to embrace pluralism and religious tolerance. Golani has made history and sparked hope among millions of Syrians, said Dareen Khalifa, a senior adviser with the International Crisis Group and an expert on Syrian groups. But he and the rebels now face a formidable challenge ahead. One can only hope they rise to the occasion. The U.N.s special envoy for Syria, Geir Pedersen, called Saturday for urgent talks in Geneva to ensure an orderly political transition. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, whose country is Assads chief international backer, said he feels sorry for the Syrian people. The Gulf nation of Qatar, a key regional mediator, hosted an emergency meeting of foreign ministers and top officials from eight countries with interests in Syria late Saturday. The participants included Iran, Saudi Arabia, Russia and Turkey. Majed bin Mohammed al-Ansari, Qatars foreign ministry spokesman and an adviser to the prime minister, told reporters that they agreed on the need to engage all parties on the ground, including the HTS, and that the main concern is stability and safe transition. The Israeli military said Sunday it has deployed forces in a demilitarized buffer zone along its northern frontier with Syria following the rebel offensive there. The military, which said it also sent troops to other places necessary for its defense, said the deployment was meant to provide security for residents of the Israeli-annexed Golan Heights. Israel captured the territory in the 1967 Mideast war and the international community, except for the United States, views it as occupied. Source: The Associated Press --Agencies",

        "date": "December 8, 2024 07:00 pm",
        "content": "Ghanas Vice-President Mahamudu Bawumia has accepted defeat in Saturdays election and congratulated the opposition candidate, former President John Mahama, on his victory. The people have voted for change, said Bawumia. The elections come amid the countrys worst economic crisis in a generation, which saw the country default on its debt. Despite Bawumias concession, no official results have been declared. The Electoral Commission (EC) said results had been delayed because supporters of the two main parties were impeding the process and it had asked the police to clear the collation centres. Mahamas supporters have taken to the streets to celebrate in its northern stronghold of Tamale, the central city of Kumasi and the capital, Accra. Bawumia said he was basing his statement on internal tallies from the governing New Patriotic Party (NPP). He said these showed Mahama had won decisively, while the opposition National Democratic Congress (NDC) had also won the parliamentary election. Mahama confirmed that Bawumia had called to congratulate him on his emphatic victory. The NDC earlier said that its internal results showed Mahama had won 56 of the vote against 41 for Bawumia. The vice-president said he was accepting defeat before the official announcement of the results to avoid further tension and preserve the peace of our country. President Nana Akufo-Addo is stepping down after reaching the official limit of two terms in office. Mahama, 65, previously led Ghana from 2012 until 2017, when he was replaced by Akufo-Addo. Mahama also lost the 2020 election so this victory represents a stunning comeback. Since the return of multi-party politics to Ghana in 1992, only candidates from either the NDC or the NPP have won the presidency. No party has ever won more than two consecutive terms in power - a trend that looks set to continue. Mahamas previous time in office was marred by an ailing economy, frequent power-cuts and corruption scandals. However, Ghanaians hope it will be different this time round. In Tamale, NDC supporter Gajia One told the BBC: We handed over to them NPP and thought they could manage the country well, but they have failed, and we take over again. John Mahama is the right man to rule this country. We are fed up. Source: BBC --Agencies",

        "date": "December 9, 2024 08:22 am",
        "content": "The Sri Lanka Navy, renowned for its storied history as the nations maritime defence force, is celebrating its 74th Anniversary today (9). Under the able leadership of Commander of the Navy, Vice Admiral Priyantha Perera, a series of programmes are being conducted across all Naval Commands, highlighting the Navys enduring traditions and religious practices as part of the anniversary festivities. Issuing a statement, the Sri Lanka Navy said that in celebration of the Navys Anniversary, a total of 2138 senior and junior sailors have been advanced to higher rates as of today (9), following the recommendation of the Commander of the Navy, Vice Admiral Priyantha Perera. The advancements include 158 to Ordinary Seaman, 279 to Able Seaman, 406 to Leading Seaman, 391 to Petty Officer, 539 to Chief Petty Officer, 354 to Fleet Chief Petty Officer, and 11 to Master Chief Petty Officer. Celebrating its 74th Anniversary today, the Sri Lanka Navy honours a rich and storied legacy. The journey began in Ceylon with the Naval Volunteer Force Ordinance No. 01 of 1937, leading to the establishment of the Ceylon Volunteer Naval Force in 1939, the statement said. In the 1950s, the Navy embarked on a new chapter by establishing a Regular Naval Force, culminating in the formation of the Royal Ceylon Navy through the Navy Act No. 34 of 1950, effective from 09th December 1950. With the countrys transition to a republic in 1972, the Royal Ceylon Navy became the Sri Lanka Navy, continuously expanding its capabilities and securing the nations maritime boundaries. In the early 1980s, as terrorist activities began to emerge, the Sri Lanka Navy transitioned from a ceremonial role to a key military force. Over the years, the Navy has significantly bolstered its personnel and naval capabilities, affirming its dedication to eliminating terrorism within the country. During the pivotal humanitarian operation that concluded nearly three decades of terrorism, the Sri Lanka Navy played a commendable role as the First Line of Defence. Currently, as the nations sole sea-going force, the Navy is committed to ensuring a stable ocean region by combating drug trafficking, addressing non traditional maritime challenges, and curbing various illegal activities originating from sea routes, the Navy said. In partnership with the Combined Maritime Forces (CMF), the worlds largest maritime coalition, the Navy helps uphold the International Rules-Based Order (IRBO) on the high seas, ensuring freedom of navigation. In a notable development, the Sri Lanka Navy is set to take command of the Combined Task Force (CTF) 154, a unit within the CMF, for a six-month period starting January 2025. This achievement has significantly elevated the reputation of the Sri Lanka Navy and the nation on the international stage, garnering widespread acclaim. The Navy has rolled out its Maritime Strategy 2030 and beyond, meticulously crafted using scientific methods to guide the gradual evolution of the Navy and the Coast Guard. This plan focuses on enhancing capabilities, integrating advanced technology, and developing professional manpower. Consequently, the Navy is steadfast in its commitment to fulfilling the nations maritime ambitions by optimally utilizing its resources and personnel, it added. The religious programmes organized in view of the 74th Anniversary of the Navy also took a center stage. During these multi-religious spiritual events, merits were transferred on fallen naval war veterans and blessings were invoked on Commander of the Navy, naval personnel both serving and retired, their family members, on the occasion of the anniversary. Accordingly, the symbolic Kanchuka Puja and Flag Blessing ceremonies were held at the Ruwanwelisaya and Jaya Sri Maha Bodhi in Anuradhapura. Similarly, the Joint Christian Commemoration  Thanksgiving Service was held at Cathedral of St. Lucia, Kotahena. The special Puja of Hindu tradition was held at Sri Ponnambalawaneswarar Kovil, Colombo and the special Islamic prayer session was held at the Jummah Mosque, Chatham Street. In addition, an All-night Pirith Chanting and Alms Giving for 74 members of Maha Sangha were held at the Welisara Naval Complex, said Sri Lanka Navy. Meanwhile, a Gilanpasa offering was held at the Temple of the Sacred Tooth Relic in Kandy. Moreover, a Buddha Puja to the Sacred Tooth Relic and alms for the members of Maha Sangha were arranged at the Temple of the Sacred Tooth Relic. Further, an Aloka Puja at Sandahiru Seya and a special Puja at Dhathu Mandira of Kelaniya Temple have been arranged as part of the religious segment of anniversary celebrations. In conjunction with the anniversary celebrations, the Navy has organized blood donation campaigns across the Eastern, and Northwestern Naval Commands. A significant number of naval personnel have generously participated, contributing to the noble cause of saving lives through blood donation, the statement added. In celebration of the Navys anniversary, the Navy Welfare Directorate, under the guidance of the Commander of the Navy, is rolling out a heartwarming initiative. They are reaching out to the families of naval heroes who gave their lives for the nation or are missing in action, to check on their well-being and offer support. This touching gesture exemplifies the Navys commitment to honouring its brave personnel and their loved ones, it added. This gesture serves as a heartfelt tribute from the Navy to the close relatives and dear family members of the heroic warriors. These families provided unwavering support and strength to their beloved sons, husbands, and fathers, enabling them to perform such noble duties. Under the esteemed leadership of the Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces and President, Hon. Anura Kumara Dissanayake, and the Ministry of Defence, the Sri Lanka Navy, led by Vice Admiral Priyantha Perera, remains ever vigilant and fully prepared to tackle any maritime challenge. To this end, the Navy is steadfast in fulfilling its military, diplomatic, and constabulary roles always prioritizing the nations best interests, nurturing a stable ocean region.",

We aim to initially focus on Buses and Lorries, followed by other vehicles in subsequent phases. However, there has been no decision from the government on importing vehicles, Manage explained. He urged vehicle owners not to sell their vehicles at reduced prices due to speculation, emphasizing that no timeline for resuming imports has been announced.

        "date": "December 9, 2024 08:52 am",
        "content": "Police are considering placing an overseas travel ban on South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol as they investigate possible rebellion charges over his brief imposition of martial law last week, reports said Monday. Yoons martial law decree last Tuesday, which brought armed special forces troops into Seoul streets, is plunging South Korea into huge political turmoil. On Sunday, he avoided an opposition-led bid to impeach him, with most ruling party lawmakers boycotting a floor vote. But the opposition parties vowed to submit a new impeachment motion against him this week. On Monday, Yonhap news agency cited police as saying that they are considering banning Yoon from leaving the country as they investigate charges of rebellion. Other South Korean media carried similar reports. Repeated calls to the National Police Agency werent immediately answered. The main opposition Democratic Party called Yoons martial law imposition unconstitutional, illegal rebellion or a coup. It has filed complaints with police against at least nine people, including Yoon and the former defense minister, over the alleged rebellion. While the president mostly has immunity from prosecution while in office, that does not extend to allegations of rebellion or treason. South Korean prosecutors on Sunday detained former Defense Minister Kim Yong Hyun, who allegedly recommended Yoon declare martial law. He became the first person detained over the martial law case. The Defense Ministry said it has separately suspended three top military commanders over their alleged involvement in imposing martial law. They were among those facing the opposition-raised rebellion allegations. On Saturday, Yoon issued an apology over the martial law decree, saying he wont shirk legal or political responsibility for the declaration. He said he would leave it to his party to chart a course through the countrys political turmoil, including matters related to my term in office. Since taking office in 2022 for a single five-year term, Yoon has struggled to push his agenda through an opposition-controlled parliament and grappled with low approval ratings amid scandals involving himself and his wife. In his martial law announcement on Tuesday night, Yoon called parliament a den of criminals bogging down state affairs and vowed to eliminate shameless North Korea followers and anti-state forces.

        "date": "December 9, 2024 09:26 am",
        "content": "President-elect Donald Trump has said he will look at pardons for those involved in the 2021 US Capitol riot on his first day back in office next month. These people are living in hell, he told NBCs Meet the Press in his first broadcast network interview since winning Novembers election. The Republican also vowed to end automatic citizenship for anyone born in the country, but offered to work with Democrats to help some undocumented immigrants who were brought to the US as children. In the wide-ranging sit-down, which was recorded on Friday, Trump promised to issue a lot of executive orders, including on immigration, energy and the economy, after he is inaugurated on 20 January. While he suggested he would not seek a justice department investigation into Joe Biden, he said that some of his political adversaries, including lawmakers who investigated the Capitol riot, should be jailed. Trump was asked whether he would seek to pardon the hundreds of people convicted of involvement in that riot, when supporters of his stormed Congress three months after his defeat in the 2020 election. Were going to look at independent cases, he said. Yeah, but Im going to be acting very quickly. First day, he added. Trump continued: You know, by the way, theyve been in there for years, and theyre in a filthy, disgusting place that shouldnt even be allowed to be open. The president-elect made other news in the NBC interview aired on Sunday: He offered a caveat on whether he would keep the US in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (Nato): If theyre paying their bills, and if I think theyre doing a fair - theyre treating us fairly, the answer is absolutely, Id stay with Nato. Trump said he would not seek to impose restrictions on abortion pills, though when asked to make a guarantee, he added: Well, I commit. I mean...things change. The Republican said Ukraine should probably expect less aid when he returns to the White House. Trump said he thinks somebody has to find out if there is a link between autism and childhood vaccines - an idea that has been ruled out by multiple studies around the world. Trump suggested his nominee for health secretary, vaccine sceptic Robert F Kennedy Jr, would look into the matter. The president-elect repeated his promise that he will not seek to cut Social Security, nor raise its eligibility age, though he said he would make it more efficient, without offering further details. Pressed on whether his plan to impose tariffs on imports from major US trading partners would raise consumer prices for Americans, he said: I cant guarantee anything. I cant guarantee tomorrow. On the subject of immigration, Trump told NBC he would seek through executive action to end so-called birthright citizenship, which entitles anyone born in the US to an American passport, even if their parents were born elsewhere. Birthright citizenship stems from the 14th Amendment of the US Constitution, which states that all persons born in the United States are citizens of the United States. Were going to have to get it changed, Trump said. Well maybe have to go back to the people. But we have to end it. Trump also said he would follow through on his campaign pledge to deport undocumented immigrants, including those with family members who are US citizens. I dont want to be breaking up families, he said, so the only way you dont break up the family is you keep them together and you have to send them all back. Trump also said he wants to work with Congress to help so-called Dreamers, undocumented immigrants who were shielded under an Obama-era programme, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, which Trump once attempted to scrap. I will work with the Democrats on a plan, he said, adding that some of these immigrants have found good jobs and started businesses. Trump seemed to offer mixed signals on whether he would follow through on his repeated vows to seek retribution against political adversaries. Outgoing US President Joe Biden this week issued a sweeping pardon to his criminally convicted son, Hunter. The Democrat is reported to be considering other blanket pardons for political allies before he leaves office next month. Trump seemed to indicate that he would not seek a special counsel investigation into Biden and his family, as he once vowed. Im not looking to go back into the past, he said. Im looking to make our country successful. Retribution will be through success. But he also said that members of the now-defunct, Democratic-led House of Representatives committee that investigated him should go to jail. One member of the panel, former Republican congresswoman Liz Cheney, hit back at Trump on Sunday. She said his comment that members of the committee should be jailed was a continuation of his assault on the rule of law and the foundations of our republic. In his NBC interview Trump also said he would not direct the FBI to pursue investigations against his foes. But he also told the network: If they were crooked, if they did something wrong, if they have broken the law, probably. They went after me. You know, they went after me, and I did nothing wrong.

        "title": "Jay-Z accused of sexually assaulting 13-year-old in 2000 incident along with Sean Diddy Combs",
        "date": "December 9, 2024 09:58 am",
        "content": "A woman who alleges she was sexually assaulted by Sean Diddy Combs has amended her lawsuit to include allegations that she was also assaulted by Jay-Z at the same party. The lawsuit was initially filed against Combs in October, but on Sunday the woman added Shawn Carter, the rapper and businessman known as Jay-Z, as a defendant in the civil lawsuit. Carter is the first celebrity to be accused of sexual assault in connection to Combs. In a statement addressed to CNN, Carter called the allegations so heinous in nature that I implore you to file a criminal complaint, not a civil one!! Whomever would commit such a crime against a minor should be locked away, would you not agree? Combs was indicted on charges of sex trafficking, racketeering conspiracy and prostitution related charges. Combs pleaded not guilty to the charges and has denied all wrongdoing in roughly 30 civil lawsuits that have been filed against him. The woman, who is identified as a Jane Doe, says she was 13 years old at the time she was allegedly assaulted by Combs and Carter at an after party following the Video Music Awards in 2000. The woman alleges she began to feel woozy after consuming a drink at the party and wandered into a nearby bedroom. The woman alleges Carter raped her first, followed by Combs. The woman says she hit Combs and ran out of the party, according to the amended lawsuit. Carter was identified in the initial lawsuit as Celebrity A. News of the lawsuit was first reported by NBC. According to the lawsuit, the Does attorneys reached out to Carter to request a mediation to resolve this matter. Upon present information and belief, Jay-Z responded to said letter by not only filing an utterly frivolous lawsuit, but by also orchestrating a conspiracy of harassment, bullying and intimidation against Plaintiffs lawyers, their families, employees and former associates in an attempt to silence Plaintiff from naming Jay-Z herein. This effort was meant to scare Plaintiff and to discredit her counsel. That effort failed. Indeed, Plaintiff chose to file this amendment as a result of the egregious conduct perpetuated by Carter, according to the lawsuit. In his response sent to CNN on Sunday  which was addressed to Does attorney  Carter called the mediation request a blackmail attempt. Carter also said this lawyer, who I have done a bit of research on, seems to have a pattern of these type of theatrics! In a statement from Houston-based attorney Tony Buzbee on Saturday, he wrote, The pleading speaks for itself. This is a very serious matter that will be litigated in court. CNN has also reached out to Jay-Zs wife Beyoncé Knowles for comment. Carter added in his statement that his only heartbreak is for his family: My wife and I will have to sit our children down, one of whom is at the age where her friends will surely see the press and ask questions about the nature of these claims, and explain the cruelty and greed of people. I mourn yet another loss of innocence. Children should not have to endure such at their young age. CNN reported in November that an anonymous male celebrity filed a lawsuit against the Texas attorney representing the Doe alleging he was the victim of an extortion scheme. The celebrity accused Buzbee and his firm of shamelessly attempting to extort exorbitant sums from him or else publicly file wildly false horrific allegations against him. Attorneys for the unnamed celebrity claimed further the Buzbee had threatened to unleash entirely fabricated and salacious allegations of sexual assault that included multiple instances of rape of a minor, both male and female if their client refuses to comply with their demands. Buzbee denied the extortion claims against him, in an Instagram post in which he wrote that his firm wont allow the powerful and their high-dollar lawyers to intimidate or silence sexual assault survivors, and in a statement to CNN. If you are trying to hide your identity and you claim you did nothing wrong, doesnt seem very smart to take this approach, Buzbee told CNN in an email at the time. We will address it in due course. I have confidence that with full public disclosure all of this will sort itself out, Buzbee wrote. On Sunday, Buzbee responded on social media to Carters statement, saying that the alleged victim never demanded a penny from him, claiming they only sought confidential mediation. Buzbee added, She is emboldened. Im very proud of her resolve. Source: CNN --Agencies",

        "date": "December 9, 2024 10:05 am",
        "content": "President-elect Donald Trumps transition team has invited five major tech companies, including Google , Microsoft and Meta Platforms to a meeting in mid-December about dealing with online sales of drugs, The Information reported on Sunday. A representative for Jim Carroll, the drug czar during Trumps first term, and Trumps transition team emailed staffers from the three tech giants on Thursday, as well as those from Snap and TikTok, to invite them to a call, the report added, citing a person with direct knowledge of the correspondence. The transition officials want to hear from the companies about their priorities and any barriers to addressing issues around the sales of drugs online, the person told the Information. Google, Microsoft, Meta, Snap, TikTok and the Trump transition team did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. Trump has vowed to get Mexico to do more to stop the flow of fentanyl to the U.S., which has killed hundreds of thousands of Americans and threatened to impose steep tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada unless those countries curb fentanyl trafficking and illegal migration. In November, Trump also said in a post on Truth Social that he will be working on a large scale United States Advertising Campaign, explaining how bad fentanyl is for people to use. In March, The Wall Street Journal reported that U.S. prosecutors were investigating Metas role and whether it profited from the sale and distribution of drugs on Facebook and Instagram. In January, eBay agreed to pay 59 million and upgrade compliance measures to resolve U.S. Department of Justice allegations that it didnt do enough to stop criminals from buying devices for making counterfeit drugs, including pills laced with fentanyl.

        "title": "Ousted Syrian leader Assad flees to Moscow after fall of Damascus, Russian state media say",
        "date": "December 9, 2024 10:19 am",
        "content": "Ousted Syrian leader Bashar Assad fled to Moscow and received asylum from his longtime ally, Russian media said Sunday, hours after a stunning rebel advance seized control of Damascus and ended his familys 50 years of iron rule. Thousands of Syrians poured into streets echoing with celebratory gunfire and waved the revolutionary flag in scenes that recalled the early days of the Arab Spring uprising, before a brutal crackdown and the rise of an insurgency plunged the country into a nearly 14-year civil war. The swiftly moving events raised questions about the future of the country and the wider region. Our approach has shifted the balance of power in the Middle East, President Joe Biden said, crediting action by the U.S. and its allies for weakening Syrias backers  Russia, Iran and Hezbollah. He called the fall of Assad a fundamental act of justice but also a moment of risk and uncertainty, and said rebel groups are saying the right things now but the U.S. would assess their actions. Russia requested an emergency session of the U.N. Security Council to discuss Syria, according to Dmitry Polyansky, its deputy ambassador to the U.N., in a post on Telegram. The arrival of Assad and his family in Moscow was reported by Russian agencies Tass and RIA, citing an unidentified source at the Kremlin. A spokesman there didnt immediately respond to questions. RIA also said Syrian insurgents had guaranteed the security of Russian military bases and diplomatic posts in Syria. Earlier, Russia said Assad left Syria after negotiations with rebel groups and that he had given instructions to transfer power peacefully. The leader of Syrias biggest rebel faction, Abu Mohammed al-Golani, is poised to chart the countrys future. The former al-Qaida commander cut ties with the group years ago and says he embraces pluralism and religious tolerance. His Hayat Tahrir al-Sham group, or HTS, is considered a terrorist organization by the U.S. and the U.N. In his first public appearance since fighters entered the Damascus suburbs Saturday, al-Golani visited the Umayyad Mosque and described Assads fall as a victory to the Islamic nation. Calling himself by his given name, Ahmad al-Sharaa, and not his nom de guerre, he said Assad had made Syria a farm for Irans greed. Assad loses control of Syria after a stunning rebel advance reached the capital The rebels face the daunting task of healing bitter divisions in a country ravaged by war and split among armed factions. Turkey-backed opposition fighters are battling U.S.-allied Kurdish forces in the north, and the Islamic State group is still active in remote areas. Syrian state television broadcast a rebel statement saying Assad had been overthrown and all prisoners had been released. They urged people to preserve the institutions of the free Syrian state, and announced a curfew in Damascus from 4 p.m. to 5 a.m. An online video purported to show rebels freeing dozens of women at the notorious Saydnaya prison, where rights groups say thousands were tortured and killed. At least one small child was seen among them. This happiness will not be completed until I can see my son out of prison and know where is he, said one relative, Bassam Masr. I have been searching for him for two hours. He has been detained for 13 years. Rebel commander Anas Salkhadi appeared on state TV and sought to reassure religious and ethnic minorities, saying: Syria is for everyone, no exceptions. Syria is for Druze, Sunnis, Alawites, and all sects. We will not deal with people the way the Assad family did, he added. Celebrations in the capital Damascus residents prayed in mosques and celebrated in squares, calling, God is great. People chanted anti-Assad slogans and honked car horns. Teenage boys picked up weapons apparently discarded by security forces and fired into the air. Soldiers and police fled their posts and looters broke into the Defense Ministry. Families wandered the presidential palace, walking by damaged portraits of Assad. Other parts of the capital were empty and shops were closed. Its like a dream. I need someone to wake me up, said opposition fighter Abu Laith, adding the rebels were welcomed in Damascus with love. Rebels stood guard at the Justice Ministry, where Judge Khitam Haddad said he and colleagues were protecting documents. Outside, residents sought information about relatives who disappeared under Assad. The rebels have felt the pain of the people, said one woman, giving only her first name, Heba. She worried about possible revenge killings by the rebels, many of whom appeared to be underage. Syrias historically pro-government newspaper al-Watan called it a new page for Syria. We thank God for not shedding more blood. It added that media workers should not be blamed for publishing past government statements ordered from above. A statement from the Alawite sect that formed the core of Assads base called on young Syrians to be calm, rational and prudent and not to be dragged into what tears apart the unity of our country. The rebels mainly come from the Sunni Muslim majority in Syria, which also has sizable Druze, Christian and Kurdish communities. In Qamishli in the northeast, a Kurdish man slapped a statue of the late leader Hafez Assad with his shoe. Calls for an orderly transition The rebel advances since Nov. 27 were the largest in recent years, and saw the cities of Aleppo, Hama and Homs fall within days as the Syrian army melted away. The road to Damascus from the Lebanese border was littered with military uniforms and charred armored vehicles. Russia, Iran and Hezbollah, which provided crucial support to Assad, abandoned him as they reeled from other conflicts. The end of Assads rule was a major blow to Iran and its proxies, already weakened by conflict with Israel. Iran said Syrians should decide their future without destructive, coercive, foreign intervention. The Iranian Embassy in Damascus was ransacked after apparently having been abandoned. Hossein Akbari, Irans ambassador to Syria, said it was effectively impossible to help the Syrian government after it admitted the insurgents military superiority. Speaking on Iranian state media from an undisclosed location, he said Syrias government decided Saturday night to hand over power peacefully. When the army and the people could not resist, it was a good decision to let go to prevent bloodshed and destruction, Akbari said, adding that some of his colleagues left Syria before sunrise. Irans Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, speaking on state TV, said there were concerns about the possibility of civil war, disintegration of Syria, total collapse and turning Syria into a shelter for terrorists. Syrian Prime Minister Mohammed Ghazi Jalali has said the government was ready to extend its hand to the opposition and turn its functions over to a transitional government. A video on Syrian opposition media showed armed men escorting him from his office to a hotel. The U.N.s special envoy for Syria, Geir Pedersen, has called for urgent talks in Geneva to ensure an orderly political transition. The Gulf nation of Qatar, a key regional mediator, hosted an emergency meeting of foreign ministers and top officials from eight countries with interests in Syria late Saturday, including Iran, Saudi Arabia, Russia and Turkey. Majed al-Ansari, Qatars Foreign Ministry spokesman, said they agreed on the need to engage all parties on the ground, including the HTS, and that the main concern is stability and safe transition. Meanwhile, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israeli troops had seized a buffer zone in the Golan Heights established in 1974, saying it was to protect Israeli residents after Syrian troops abandoned positions. Israels military later warned residents of five southern Syria communities to stay home for their safety, and didnt respond to questions. Israel captured the Golan in the 1967 Mideast war and later annexed it. The international community, except for the U.S., views it as occupied, and the Arab League on Sunday condemned what it called Israels efforts to take advantage of Assads downfall to occupy more territory.

        "content": "The Center for Environment and Nature Studies (CENS) announced that it will submit a report today (09) to the Ministry of Environment and the Ministry of Agriculture, proposing measures to address wildlife populations that damage crops in Sri Lanka. National Coordinator of CENS, Environmentalist Dr. Ravindra Kariyawasam, emphasized the significance of the issue and outlined the reports recommendations. The population of toque macaque has increased in Sri Lanka. This is due to the decline of natural predators and reduced food availability in forests, which has driven these animals to seek food in agricultural areas. We propose establishing a unified mechanism by merging 15 institutions to manage toque macaque populations effectively. Today, we are presenting these proposals to the Minister of Environment, said Dr. Kariyawasam. Dr. Kariyawasam also discussed the need for innovative and research-driven approaches, citing Indias experience in managing monkey populations in the states of Jammu and Kashmir. In India, sterilization efforts go beyond surgeries. Techniques include mixing sterilization drugs with food or using hormones. Some countries have even explored using viruses. In Sri Lanka, we need to introduce hormones through food in controlled quantities. However, this requires careful research to avoid risks, particularly to endemic species like the Macaca sinica monkeys, he explained. The report, which includes both short-term and long-term strategies, aims to address the growing wildlife challenge sustainably while minimizing potential ecological risks, Dr. Kariyawasam noted.",

The union had earlier requested the CEB management to provide bonuses before December 10, citing improved financial performance and the change in government administration as reasons. General Secretary of the union Ranjan Jayalal pointed out during a press briefing that CEB employees had not received bonuses for the past two years under the previous government. With the NPP now in power, he argued, it was reasonable to expect better benefits for the workforce. However, the CEB Board of Directors has justified their decision by explaining how this years profit has been utilized. According to the Board, the CEB generated a large profit in 2024, but Rs. 112 billion of it was allocated to settle outstanding debt to institutions such as the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC). The remaining Rs. 41 billion was used to reduce electricity tariffs for consumers in the year 2024, aligning with the governments promise to ease the cost of living. This left no surplus to accommodate bonuses for employees, according to the CEB. When inquired by Ada Derana, CEB Media Spokesperson Dhanushka Parakramasinghe confirmed that the Board of Directors had already finalized its decision.",

        "date": "December 9, 2024 01:31 pm",
        "content": "Tongas Prime Minister Siaosi Sovaleni abruptly resigned in parliament on Monday ahead of a planned no-confidence vote in his leadership, capping a period of fraught relations between his government and Tongas king. Sovaleni, who took office in 2021, did not specify a reason for his departure but his resignation halted the no-confidence motion expected on Monday. It was not immediately clear who would succeed him. His resignation comes less than a year before a national election in Tonga, a South Pacific island nation of 105,000 people, and it highlighted the occasional tensions between Tongas monarchy and elected lawmakers in a still-young democracy after reforms that transferred powers from the royal family and nobles to regular citizens in 2010. A statement on the Tongan Parliament Facebook page said Sovaleni, 54, quit for the good of the country and moving Tonga forward. Video from Tongas parliament on Monday showed the leader making brief and emotional remarks in Tongan before the no-confidence vote was scheduled to take place. Sovalenis office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. His leadership had survived a previous no-confidence vote in September 2023. In recent months, Sovalenis tenure was marked by difficult relations with Tongas head of state, King Tupou VI. Although the sovereigns predecessor ceded power voluntarily in the 2010 democratic reforms, Tupou VI retains powers to dissolve parliament, appoint judges and veto laws. The king at times made his dissatisfaction with Sovaleni apparent, including by withdrawing confidence in him as defense minister in February. Some lawmakers at first decried the kings pressure on Sovaleni and his foreign minister as unconstitutional, but both eventually resigned their posts in April  although Sovaleni remained prime minister. A month earlier, Sovaleni had been photographed at a traditional ceremony of apology to the king, but neither side publicly addressed the event. When Tonga hosted the Pacific Islands Forum Leaders Meeting in August, the king was traveling abroad and did not attend the conference  a significant event for the small Pacific nation  which analysts said was a snub to Sovaleni and his government. Speaking to Radio New Zealand on Monday, Sovaleni did not signal a particular reason for his departure. Asked whether his decision was prompted by disagreements with the king, Sovaleni said that differences in views were normal. Im not sure whether thats the reason, he said, according to RNZ, adding that he still did not know why he and Tongas foreign minister had lost the kings confidence earlier this year. But we still provide respect to his majesty, Sovaleni told RNZ. Whatever we do, we always consider that relationship. So maybe you can ask someone else. His successor will be selected by Tongas 26 lawmakers in a vote. The parliament is made up of 17 lawmakers elected by the public and nine who are nobles, elected by a group of hereditary chiefs. Sovaleni entered parliament in 2014 and had been a minister since 2019. He led Tonga as the tourism-dependent country struggled to rebound from the impact of the coronavirus pandemic, growing threats from climate change and a catastrophic 2022 volcanic eruption and tsunami, which battered beachfront resorts, homes and businesses around Tongas 171 islands. A former senior public servant who also worked in the private sector before entering politics, Sovaleni is the son of a former Tongan deputy prime minister. He attended high school in New Zealand and studied at the University of Oxford and the University of the South Pacific, attaining masters degrees in computer science and business.

        "content": "Germany has taken festive excess to a whole new level with the unveiling of the worlds most expensive Christmas tree. Standing at 10 feet tall, this solid gold monstrosity is worth an eye-watering 4million. The gilded giant, crafted by Munich-based bullion dealers Pro Aurum, is made of 2,024 gold Vienna Philharmonic coins, chosen to mark the year. Weighing more than 60 kilograms, it is crowned with a 24-carat gold coin in place of a traditional star or angel. Benjamin Summa, spokesperson for Pro Aurum, lauded the creation: The gold Christmas tree illustrates this timeless meaning of precious metal in an impressive way. But while the company celebrates its shimmering achievement, others have called the display tone-deaf in an era when rising costs of living loom large for many. And before anyone gets any ideas, the tree is not for sale. Pro Aurum said that its meant to showcase the enduring value of gold, rather than invite prospective buyers. This isnt the first time a Christmas tree has sparked controversy or disbelief. Over the years, holiday decorations around the world have swung wildly between opulence and outright absurdity.

        "date": "December 9, 2024 03:58 pm",
        "content": "Medical experts have emphasized that the unnecessary and incorrect use of antibiotics poses significant harm to human body by fostering resistance in the body, which reduces the effectiveness of these drugs. Speaking on Ada Deranas current affairs program Big Focus, Deputy Director General of Tertiary Care Services at the Ministry of Health, Dr. Priyantha Athapattu, explained the concept of antibiotic resistance: Antibiotic resistance refers to the diminishing effectiveness of drugs designed to combat microorganismsbacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites. When these drugs are misused, microorganisms develop resistance, rendering the medications ineffective and exacerbating health challenges. Dr. Athapattu noted that the first antibiotic, penicillin, discovered in 1928 and introduced in 1944, marked the beginning of antibiotic treatment. Since then, numerous antibiotics have been developed. However, advancements in antibiotic production have slowed significantly due to high costs, with only 10 new antibiotics produced between 2017 and 2023. In the meantime, President of the Association of Specialist Doctors in Microbiology, Dr. Sujatha Pathirage, highlighted the alarming trend of increasing antibiotic resistance: Bacteria have developed resistance to antibiotics due to misuse, while the production of new antibiotics has dwindled. Resistance to existing drugs is on the rise, leaving us with fewer options for treatment. Dr. Athapattu further stressed the importance of responsible antibiotic use and the role of medical professionals in preventing misuse: Not all diseases require medication. There are various therapieschemotherapy, food therapy, sports therapythat complement medical treatment. Medicines must be used at the right dose, time, and method to be effective. Unfortunately, many people misuse antibiotics in a bid for quick recovery, which is neither sustainable nor safe. He also urged patients to consider the potential side effects of medication: Patients need to understand the risks of medicine misuse, including potential damage to the brain, heart, kidneys, and liver. Doctors, too, have a duty to base treatments on evidence rather than patient demands for instant relief.",

Advanced Level (AL) examination duties. Speaking at a press conference, CTU General Secretary Joseph Stalin highlighted confusion caused by recent circulars issued by the Commissioner General of Examinations regarding transportation allowances for examination staff. The Advanced Level Examination is being conducted these days. A new issue has arisen regarding the examination staff due two letters issued by the Examination Commissioner, he added. According to Stalin, the first letter, dated November 11, indicated that staff traveling more than 10 kilometers to an exam center would receive a transportation allowance of Rs. 1,000. However, a subsequent letter issued on December 12 announced significant reductions in these allowances. For distances over 10 kilometers, the allowance was reduced to Rs. 500. For distances between 5 and 10 kilometers, it was cut from Rs. 750 to Rs. 400. Similarly, allowances for distances between 2 and 5 kilometers were reduced from Rs. 500 to Rs. 300, and for less than 2 kilometers, from Rs. 300 to Rs. 200, Stalin detailed. He expressed concern over the impact of these revisions, stating, Now, while there is a letter saying that the exam invigilators who come to work on the exam have to be paid, a new reduction has been made. Due to this, the exam invigilators have become seriously confused.",

Speaking at the National Commemoration of the International Anti-Corruption Day held at the Bandaranaike Memorial International Conference Hall (BMICH) today (12), the President outlined his vision for a transparent and accountable governance framework. Under the theme Let us be exemplary pioneers of a proud nation, the event brought together stakeholders to address the pressing issue of corruption. Addressing the event, the Head of the State highlighted the inefficiency of existing mechanisms. If court cases are withdrawn, we should explain why. If files are stuck in seven or eight drawers, shouldnt we explain to the people why they are stuck? Our entire system has collapsed. Rebuilding our country requires restoring this entire system. It cannot be achieved by addressing a small legal issue or restructuring one institution. My goal is to restore the system and make the state healthy again. That is my expectation, Dissanayake expressed. The President also criticized the selective application of laws, describing the current state as inequitable and ineffective. In one year, the Bribery Commission had punished only two PCs, one Grama Sevaka, an SI, and a clerk. This law has been implemented like a spiders websmall animals get entangled while big animals break free. The people know such a law exists, but they also know it is not implemented fairly. Today, the trust in the legal system is lacking, and rebuilding that trust is imperative. Furthermore, President Dissanayake stressed that his administrations efforts would not be limited to incremental reforms but aimed at comprehensive systemic change.",

        "date": "December 9, 2024 07:29 pm",
        "content": "At least 110 people were killed over the weekend in Haitis Cite Soleil slum when a gang leader targeted elderly people he suspected of causing his childs illness through witchcraft, the National Human Rights Defense Network (RNDDH) said on Sunday. All the victims were aged over 60, the rights group said. Wharf Jeremie gang leader Monel Mikano Felix ordered the massacre after his child became sick, RNDDH said, saying that he sought advice from a Voodoo priest who accused elderly people in the area of harming the child through witchcraft. Gang members killed at least 60 people on Friday and 50 on Saturday using machetes and knives, it said. Cite Soleil, a densely populated slum by the port of the capital Port-au-Prince, is among the poorest and most violent areas of Haiti. Tight gang control, including the restriction of mobile phone use, has limited residents ability to share information about the massacre. Felix, who heads the Wharf Jeremie gang, was in 2022 banned from entering neighboring Dominican Republic. Felixs child died on Saturday afternoon, RNDDH said. The United Nations in October estimated that Felixs gang numbered some 300 people and also operated around nearby Fort Dimanche and La Saline. La Saline was in November 2018 the site of the massacre of at least 71 civilians, while hundreds of homes were set on fire. Jimmy Barbecue Cherizier, the face of the Viv Ansanm alliance of gangs across Port-au-Prince, has been sanctioned by the United Nations on charges of planning the La Saline massacre while he was still a police officer, among other crimes. In October, at least 115 people were massacred in Pont-Sonde, a town in Haitis breadbasket Artibonite region, in what the Gran Grif gang said was retaliation for residents working with a self-defense group hindering their road toll operations. The government, wracked by political infighting, has struggled to contain armed gangs growing power in and around the capital. Haitian authorities had in 2022 requested international security support for local police, but the mission - based on voluntary contributions - that the United Nations approved in 2023 has only partially deployed and is severely under-resourced. Haitian leaders have since called for the mission to be converted into a U.N. peacekeeping force to ensure it is better supplied, but the plan stalled amid opposition from China and Russia in the Security Council.

        "content": "Former President Ranil Wickremesinghes office has issued a statement, claiming that the former President did not issue any liquor licenses in violation of the rules and regulations of the Excise Department. The statement further highlighted that the government has received a revenue of over Rs. 3.1 billion during the first nine months of this year through the new liquor licenses issued during Wickremesinghes tenure as the President. The statement pointed out that the legitimacy of the procedure followed in granting the liquor licenses was verified through the recommendations made in the letter forwarded by the Election Commission to the Commissioner General of Excise on the 19 August 2024. It further highlights that the incumbent Cabinet of Ministers has the power to renew or revoke these formal revenue-generating liquor licenses. The statement was issued in response to the allegations made in Parliament by Leader of the House Minister Bimal Rathnayake that the former President has issued liquor licenses as political bribes. Addressing the Parliament recently, Minister Bimal Rathnayake disclosed that former President Ranil Wickremesinghe has issued 361 liquor vendor licenses alleging that 172 of them were granted as political bribes. A total of 361 permits have been issued since January. Among these are 172 wine store permits. We believe that these licences were issued as political bribes by former President Ranil Wickremesinghe to entice MPs to change parties, Rathnayake said while addressing the Parliament. Meanwhile on November 20, a Fundamental Rights (FR) petition was filed with the Supreme Court seeking an order that the fundamental human rights have been violated through the decision by the respondents including former President Ranil Wickremesinghe to issue liquor licenses in violation of the Excise Act after the 2024 Presidential Election was announced. The petitioners alleged that these licenses have been issued with the objective of obtaining support in the Presidential Election and that they have been issued in an arbitrary and unjust manner by avoiding the provisions of the Excise Act.",

        "date": "December 10, 2024 08:25 am",
        "content": "Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel is set to take the stand on Tuesday for the first time in his long-running corruption trial under a court order that is likely to force him to juggle between the courtroom and war room for weeks. Israel has been waging war against the Palestinian militant group Hamas in Gaza for more than a year, during which Netanyahu had been granted a delay for the start of his court appearances. But on Thursday, the judges ruled that he must start testifying. Charged with bribery, fraud and breach of trust, Netanyahu will testify three times a week, the court said, despite the Gaza war and possible new threats posed by wider turmoil in the Middle East, including in neighbouring Syria. Netanyahu was indicted in 2019 in three cases involving gifts from millionaire friends and for allegedly seeking regulatory favours for media tycoons in return for favourable coverage. He denies any wrongdoing. In the run-up to his court date, Netanyahu revived familiar pre-war rhetoric against law enforcement, describing investigations against him as a witch hunt. He denies the charges and has pleaded not guilty. The real threat to democracy in Israel is not posed by the publics elected representatives, but by some among the law enforcement authorities who refuse to accept the voters choice and are trying to carry out a coup with rabid political investigations that are unacceptable in any democracy, he said in a statement on Thursday. At a Monday night press conference Netanyahu said he had waited eight years to be able to tell his story and expressed outrage at the way witnesses had been treated during investigations. Before the war, Netanyahus legal troubles bitterly divided Israelis and shook Israeli politics through five rounds of elections. His governments bid last year to curb the powers of the judiciary further polarised Israelis. The shock Hamas attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, and the ensuing Gaza war swept Netanyahus trial off the public agenda as Israelis came together in grief and trauma. But as the war dragged on, political unity crumbled. In recent weeks, while fighting abated on one front after Israel reached a ceasefire with Hamas Lebanese ally Hezbollah, members of Netanyahus cabinet, including his justice and police ministers, have clashed with the judiciary. In power almost consecutively since 2009, Netanyahu, 75, is Israels longest serving leader and its first sitting prime minister to be charged with a crime. His domestic legal woes were compounded last month when the International Criminal Court (ICC) issued an arrest warrant for him and his former defence chief Yoav Gallant along with a Hamas leader, for alleged war crimes in the Gaza conflict.

        "date": "December 10, 2024 09:21 am",
        "content": "The United States has imposed sanctions on the former CEO of SriLankan Airlines Kapila Chandrasena and former Sri Lankan Ambassador to Russia Udayanga Weeratunga, along with their immediate family members, for their involvement in significant corruption. The U.S. State Department announced a slew of sanctions on Monday to mark International Anti-Corruption Day and the eve of Human Rights Day, targeting individuals from multiple countries. Accordingly, the US Department of State has designated 14 individuals, including immediate family members, from countries around the world for significant corruption and one individual for gross violations of human rights, pursuant to Section 7031(c) of the Departments annual appropriations act, rendering them ineligible for entry into the United States. The Department of State is also further taking steps to impose visa restrictions on dozens of individuals pursuant to multiple policies under section 212(a)(3)(C) of the Immigration and Nationality Act. The 14 individuals designated for significant corruption includes two Sri Lankan nationals, namely the former CEO of SriLankan Airlines Kapila Chandrasena and former Sri Lankan Ambassador to Russia Udayanga Weeratunga. A State Department statement said Kapila Chandrasena, the former CEO of SriLankan Airlines, was designated for sanctions along with immediate family members, for allegedly accepting a bribe in exchange for ensuring Sri Lanka purchased Airbus aircraft for over market value. Sri Lankas former ambassador to Russia, Udayanga Weeratunga, meanwhile, was accused of benefiting from a corrupt scheme involving the procurement of MiG aircraft for the Sri Lankan Air Force. He and immediate family members were designated, the statement said. In 2020, Sri Lanka ordered a probe into allegations of bribery by European planemaker Airbus over the sale of aircraft to state-run carrier SriLankan Airlines, after Airbus agreed to settle a corruption probe with regulators. A senior official at SriLankan Airlines said at the time that a Colombo court had issued orders to arrest Chandrasena and his wife Priyanka Niyomali Wijenayake as suspects of money laundering. Also sanctioned were North Macedonias former deputy prime minister, Artan Grubi, as well as Enver Bexheti, a judge from that countrys appeals court and Kevin Kedi, a councilman from the Marshall Islands, for allegedly accepting bribes. The State Department said the United States was redesignating UK resident Fawaz Akhras, father of the British-born wife of the deposed Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad, for providing him with material support. The State Department also said that the United States, in close coordination with the United Kingdom, was also sanctioning nine individuals and 19 entities involved in a global gold and diamond corruption network based in Zimbabwe.

        "content": "The Cabinet of Ministers has approved the extension of the moratorium on the execution of the Parate Law, which halts banks from acquiring creditors properties, until 31 March 2025. Announcing this weeks Cabinet decisions this morning (10), Cabinet Spokesman, Minister Nalinda Jayatissa stated that the economic crisis faced by Sri Lanka in the past 04 years has severely affected the Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs), and it has been reported that small and medium entrepreneurs have had to face difficulties in settling the loans obtained from banks. Under that situation, an environment has been created in which the properties of a significant number of business people have been taken over by banks and auctioned due to loan defaults, and therefore, the sale of properties at public auction has been temporarily suspended until 15 December 2024 by amending the Recovery of Loans by Banks (Special Provisions) Act, No. 4 of 1990, the Minister added. Further, Jayatissa expressed that requests have been made by associations related to the SMEs to further extend the moratorium on the Parate Law execution. Meanwhile, the Cabinet Spokesman noted that the government has observed that it is more appropriate to create the necessary environment for achieving a positive solution for both parties by introducing an action plan for the repayment of such defaulted loans instead of allowing the auction of properties. Accordingly, the Cabinet of Ministers has approved the proposal submitted by the President in his capacity as the Minister of Finance, Planning and Economic Development to extend the suspension of the execution of the Parate Law until 31 March 2025. Furthermore, it has also been approved that the Central Bank of Sri Lanka should prepare a multi-dimensional mechanism to resolve this issue with the active participation of all stakeholders including public and private banks and other government institutions.",

This is Sri Lankas first SEFF, designed to support the operational sustainability of ADB-financed energy projects, promote initiatives to increase the share of renewable energy, and encourage private sector participation in the renewable energy sector, particularly in the context of the countrys economic challenges, said ADB Country Director for Sri Lanka Takafumi Kadono. The facility will finance post-completion activities of ADB-financed projects, feasibility studies for advanced renewable energy technologies, preparatory work for transmission and distribution upgrades, and capacity building in emerging technologies. The first activity under the SEFF will enhance the operational sustainability of the Moragolla Hydropower Plant financed by ADB. The SEFF will play a crucial role in supporting Sri Lankas target to achieve 70 of its electricity generation from renewable energy sources by 2030, as part of its broader energy transition strategy. Achieving the 2030 target will require substantial investments in renewable energy infrastructure, grid modernization, and energy storage solutions, alongside policy reforms to encourage private sector participation and international financing. The facility complements Sri Lankas broader power sector reforms and investment program, supported by ADBs Power Sector Reforms and Financial Sustainability Program and the recently approved Power System Strengthening and Renewable Energy Integration project. The approval of the SEFF underscores ADBs continued support for Sri Lankas energy sector, recognizing the substantial progress made in advancing critical power sector reforms. These reforms aim to enhance the sectors financial sustainability, implement cost-recovery tariff adjustments, and foster competitive renewable energy development. The facility will strengthen the institutional capacity of the CEB to effectively integrate and manage renewable energy systems, adopt digital solutions, and support the sectors transition toward a more sustainable and resilient energy future. Of the total 30 million facility, 15 million will be allocated to enhance the operational sustainability of the Moragolla Hydropower Plant, while the remaining 15 million will support activities aimed at facilitating renewable energy generation and grid integration. ADB is committed to achieving a prosperous, inclusive, resilient, and sustainable Asia and the Pacific, while sustaining its efforts to eradicate extreme poverty.

According to the results of the 2024 General Election, the New Democratic Front, which contested under the symbol of the Gas Cylinder, won three parliamentary seats and two National List seats. The New Democratic Front was formed by the United National Party (UNP), the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) and the Podujana Eksath Nidahas Peramuna to contest the election. The other National List MP seat had been filled by former minister Ravi Karunanayake of the UNP, under somewhat controversial circumstances. Accordingly, it had been proposed to name one member each from the Podujana Eksath Nidahas Peramuna and the United National Party (UNP) for the two National List seats while the final decision on the matter was expected to be taken collectively by all parties in the alliance. A proposal had also been put forward to nominate former Minister Kanchana Wijesekera, who contested the election from Matara District but was not elected, for the position of National List MP from the Podujana Eksath Nidahas Peramuna faction while a decision was yet to be taken on the other seat. However, despite this the name of Ravi Karunanayake had been sent to the Election Commission on November 18, in writing by the General Secretary of the NDF, Mrs. Sharmila Perera, nominating him for one of the National List MP seats of the New Democratic Front. This move had come under intense backlash from wihitn the alliance with it also being reported that former President Wickremesinghe had informed the representatives of the New Democratic Front that Karunanayakes name had been forwarded for the position of National List MP in an arbitrary manner without his consent and the approval of the other parties in the alliance.

In their proposal, the four associations pointed out that with all inputs for the publishing industry with the exception of local labour being imported, Sri Lankas book industry is already taxed at 33.045, and the imposition of a value-added tax (VAT) of 18 at the point of sale has made books unaffordable to many, and is putting small-scale publishers out of business. Addressing media at a news conference, Sri Lanka Book Publishers Association (SLBPA) President Mr Samantha Indeewara pointed out that representatives of the new government while in the parliamentary opposition had criticised the imposition of VAT on books, and had the government of that time to reverse this. We are therefore cautiously optimistic that the concerns of the book industry would be addressed in the next budget, he said. We have brought to the governments attention the numerous anomalies affecting the industry that are directly attributable to the imposition of VAT on books, he said. This includes the fact that the majority of publishing companies are not eligible to pay VAT, and therefore are unable to deduct the VAT they pay on inputs for locally produced books, or the VAT they pay on the imports, Mr Indeewara elaborated, disclosing that only about 12 large publishing and printing companies are eligible to pay VAT on their sales and can therefore deduct the VAT they pay on inputs. However, many of the smaller publishers sell their books via the bookshops and distribution networks of the large companies, and the imposition of VAT results in all of their books being taxed, he said. Another matter of serious concern is that by imposing taxes on books, Sri Lanka continues to be in violation of the UNESCO Florence Agreement of 1950, to which the country was an early signatory and continues to be a Contracting State, the associations said. The UNESCO Florence Agreement is a treaty that binds Contracting States to not impose customs duties and taxes on certain educational, scientific, and cultural materials that are imported. The industry has once again come together to emphasize that the imposition of VAT on books would have long-term negative socioeconomic impacts by making access to knowledge on the history, culture, values and traditions of Sri Lanka, and by retarding opportunities for creative expression, in addition to making education more expensive, and compelling some book businesses to close, SLBPA General Secretary Mr Dinesh Kulatunga added. Associated with the SLBPA and joint signatories to the proposal submitted to the government were the Sri Lanka Writers Association, the All Ceylon Booksellers Association, and the Sri Lanka Book Importers and Exporters Association.",

        "title": "Minister issues scathing response to Ranils statement on liquor licenses",
        "date": "December 10, 2024 04:26 pm",
        "content": "The Cabinet Media Spokesperson, Minister Dr. Nalinda Jayatissa, announced that liquor companies owe nearly Rs. 7 billion in taxes, and that the government is taking measures to recover the outstanding dues. Dr. Jayatissas comments came in response to the statement issued by former President Ranil Wickremesinghes office on December 09. The statement claimed that Wickremesinghe had not granted any liquor licenses outside the prescribed procedure and emphasized that the government had generated over Rs. 3 billion in revenue by granting liquor licenses. Addressing the matter today, Minister Jayatissa stated: Former President Ranil Wickremesinghe said that he hoped to strengthen the temperance movement by issuing 250 to 300 liquor licenses per year and using the taxes generated from them. It is not appropriate for a person who spends his retirement life on the public tax money to express his views in such a sarcastic manner. Dr. Jayatissa further criticized the previous administrations lack of enforcement regarding tax collection from liquor companies, noting, The issue is not about issuing liquor licenses. Ranil Wickremesinghe and his party had not even taken steps to ensure that the people pay taxes for the liquor they sell by issuing those bar licenses. For example, the three companies owned by Aloysius have owed arrears of taxes and surcharges since 2022. When the decision to issue liquor licenses was taken, the decision should have also been taken to collect the unpaid taxes, he added. He stressed that the government is actively working to recover the outstanding taxes. There is outstanding tax to be collected from liquor companies amounting to nearly Rs. 7 billion. We are working to collect those taxes. If we had the power under the Act, instead of those arrears of taxes, the government could have seized their properties. Thats why I would like to tell Ranil Wickremesinghe that if coconuts had been planted in this country or repaired the rice stores, during the time he spent growing bars, this problem would not have arisen today. On Monday (09), Ranil Wickremesinghes office has issued a statement, claiming that the former President did not issue any liquor licenses in violation of the rules and regulations of the Excise Department and that the government has received a revenue of over Rs. 3.1 billion during the first nine months of this year through the new liquor licenses issued during Wickremesinghes tenure as the President. The statement pointed out that the legitimacy of the procedure followed in granting the liquor licenses was verified through the recommendations made in the letter forwarded by the Election Commission to the Commissioner General of Excise on the 19 August 2024. It further highlights that the incumbent Cabinet of Ministers has the power to renew or revoke these formal revenue-generating liquor licenses. The statement was issued in response to the allegations made in Parliament by Leader of the House Minister Bimal Rathnayake that the former President has issued liquor licenses as political bribes.",

        "title": "China targets Nvidia with antitrust probe, escalates US chip tensions",
        "date": "December 10, 2024 04:43 pm",
        "content": "China said on Monday it has launched an investigation into Nvidia, opens new tab over suspected violations of the countrys anti-monopoly law, a probe widely seen as a retaliatory shot against Washingtons latest curbs on the Chinese chip sector. The statement from the State Administration for Market Regulation announcing the probe did not elaborate on how the U.S. company, known for its artificial intelligence and gaming chips, might have violated Chinas anti-monopoly laws. It said the U.S. chipmaker was also suspected of violating commitments it made during its acquisition of Israeli chip designer Mellanox Technologies, under terms outlined in the regulators 2020 conditional approval of that deal. The announcement is the latest salvo in a long-running trade war between China and the United States as the countries vie for technological superiority. Last week, four of Chinas top industry associations issued a rare and coordinated response saying that Chinese companies should be wary of buying U.S. chips as they were no longer safe and should buy locally instead. Nvidias shares closed 2.5 lower on Monday. An Nvidia spokesperson said the company worked hard to provide the best products we can in every region and honor our commitments everywhere we do business, adding that we are happy to answer any questions regulators may have about our business. TECHnalysis Research chief analyst Bob ODonnell told Reuters that the probe is unlikely to have much of an impact on the company, particularly in the near term, because most of Nvidias most advanced chips are already restricted from being sold into China. The investigation comes after the U.S. last week launched its third crackdown in three years on Chinas semiconductor industry, which saw Washington curb exports to 140 companies, including chip equipment makers. Shortly after Washingtons announcement, Beijing banned exports to the United States of the critical minerals gallium, germanium and antimony. Nvidia is one of many companies caught up in U.S.-China friction. U.S. sanctions in 2022 banned shipments of A100 and H100 AI chips to China, leading Nvidia to develop modified versions. These China-specific variants were later restricted under tightened U.S. controls in October 2023, prompting Nvidia to release another set of modified chips for the Chinese market. Its clear that the Chinese government is trying to react against recent restrictions from the U.S., but their ability to impact the U.S. semiconductor industry continues to decrease over time, ODonnell said. Nvidia dominated Chinas AI chip market with a more than 90 share before those curbs. However, it faces increasing competition from domestic rivals, chief among them being Huawei. China accounted for around 17 of Nvidias revenue in the year to the end of January, sliding from 26 two years earlier. In 2020, the company won a key approval from China for its acquisition of Mellanox Technologies, to the relief of investors who felt Sino-U.S. trade friction could complicate the process. Nvidia and the merged entity were set multiple conditions, requiring them to supply GPU accelerators to the Chinese market on fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory terms. The companies must also provide customers and distributors the opportunity to purchase up to one years inventory of Nvidia GPU accelerators and Mellanox networking equipment under these terms. The conditions also prohibit forced product bundling, unreasonable trading terms, purchase restrictions and discriminatory treatment of customers who buy products separately. The last time China launched an anti-monopoly probe into a high-profile foreign technology firm was in 2013, when it investigated Qualcomms (QCOM.O), opens new tab local subsidiary for overcharging and abusing its market position in wireless communication standards. Qualcomm later agreed to pay a fine of 975 million, which was the largest China had ever handed out to a company at the time. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "date": "December 10, 2024 04:48 pm",
        "content": "Musical thriller Emilia Perez and post-World War Two epic The Brutalist topped the roster of films nominated on Monday for the 2025 Golden Globes, the Hollywood honors that kick off the awards season leading to the Oscars. Emilia Perez, a Spanish-language movie released by Netflix, scored 10 nods and independent distributor A24s The Brutalist earned seven. Both movies will compete for the top Globes honor - best film drama - with papal selection story Conclave, Bob Dylan biopic A Complete Unknown, sci-fi epic Dune: Part Two, historical drama Nickel Boys and September 5, the story of sports journalists who covered a hostage crisis at the Olympics. Box office smash Wicked, adapted from a long-running Broadway play about the witches in The Wizard of Oz, landed four nominations. It faces dark romantic comedy Anora and others in the best movie musical or comedy category. The Globe nominations can help movies in the race to the Academy Awards in March. Last years Hollywood strikes scrambled this years release schedule, and awards pundits say there is no clear frontrunner for best picture at the Oscars. Winners of the Globes will be chosen by 334 entertainment journalists from 85 countries, compared with roughly 9,000 voters who select the Academy Awards. The Globes voting body was expanded in recent years and organizers instituted reforms after criticisms for ethical lapses and a lack of diversity. Comedian Nikki Glaser will host the Jan. 5 Globes ceremony for the first time. The show, in the past a booze-fueled and more free-wheeling occasion than the Oscars, will be broadcast live on CBS and streamed on Paramount. Emilia Perez stars Zoe Saldana as a lawyer who helps a drug cartel leader (Spanish actor Karla Sofía Gascón) fake his death and transition from a man to a woman. Selena Gomez co-stars as the cartel leaders wife. All three were nominated by Globes voters for acting honors. Streaming service Netflix, which gives movies only a limited run in theaters and has never won the prestigious best picture Oscar, overpowered traditional studios to grab a total of 13 film nominations from Globe voters. The company also outpaced rivals in Globe TV nods with 23. It is a reminder of just how dominant that streaming platform is, said Michael Schneider, TV editor at Hollywood publication Variety. Movie nominee The Brutalist features Adrien Brody, also a Globe acting nominee, in an epic tale of a Hungarian immigrant who flees the horrors of World War Two to rebuild his life in the United States. Wicked stars Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande also received acting nominations, as did Angelina Jolie for her portrayal of opera singer Maria Callas in Maria and Zendaya for sports romance Challengers. Timothee Chalamet received a nod for his portrayal of music legend Dylan in A Complete Unknown, as did co-star Edward Norton, who plays folk singer Pete Seeger. Sebastian Stan was nominated for his role as President-elect Donald Trump in The Apprentice, along with Jeremy Strong who played Trump attorney Roy Cohn. Trump has called the film a politically disgusting hatchet job. In TV categories, restaurant tale The Bear received five nominations. Mystery comedy Only Murders in the Building and historical epic Shogun earned four each. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "date": "December 10, 2024 06:05 pm",
        "content": "Sri Lanka has received the grant of 11.28 million meters of fabric required to be provided for schoolchildren as uniform materials for the year 2025, from the Peoples Republic of China. The fabric grant was officially handed over to the Minister of Education, Higher Education and Vocational Education, Prime Minister Dr. Harini Amarasuriya by the Chinese Ambassador to Sri Lanka Qi Zhenhong during an event held at the Colombo Port today (10). The 11.28 million meters of fabric, valued at around Rs. 5.2 billion, will be distributed among the students of 10,096 government and government-aided schools and 822 pirivens. The provision of uniform fabric to students free of charge has been carried out continuously by the Ministry of Education since 1992, and vouchers were issued to obtain school uniforms during the period from 2015 to 2020. Again, beginning from the year 2021, uniforms for school students were produced and purchased from local textile manufacturers. However, in view of the economic situation faced by the country due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the Peoples Republic of China provided 70 of the uniform requirements for the year 2023 as a grant and purchased the remaining 30 from local textile manufacturers. Sri Lankas government approved receiving of the fabric grant for the year 2025, after testing the sample sent to the Ministry of Education in relation to the relevant stock of fabric by the Sri Lanka Textile and Garment Institute (SLITA), and upon receiving the recommendation that the fabric is suitable for use by school students. Speaking during the event, Prime Minister Dr. Amarasuriya expressed gratitude to the Peoples Republic of China and the Chinese President. Commenting further, she noted: The education is an extremely high priority for our country, and we know that China also values education greatly, and sees education as one of the primary modes through which we can reach development. For us as a government, investing in education is incredibly important. Investing in education means making it possible for all children irrespective of any socio-economic difference or position-to be able to accept education with dignity, Dr. Amarasuriya added.",
