        "title": "President orders strict legislation to prevent child abuse",
        "date": "May 15, 2023 03:53 pm",
        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe has issued a directive to the legal departments, instructing them to prepare a stringent legislation aimed at preventing child abuse. The President has stressed the urgency of addressing the on-going issue of child abuse perpetrated by teachers, elders, and various segments of society. To combat such acts effectively, he has emphasized the necessity of implementing a legal framework that imposes severe punishments on offenders, the Presidents Media Division (PMD) reported. The Presidents decision to take action was prompted by recent incidents, including the tragic death of a 16-year-old girl who jumped from a hotel in Kalutara, as well as the abuse of 16 children by a tuition teacher in the same region. President Ranil Wickremesinghe has specifically highlighted the need to introduce a separate set of laws dedicated to safeguarding the welfare of the nations children. To achieve this, he has called for amendments to be made to existing legislation, underscoring the importance of careful consideration during the process, it added. Significant adjustments are needed in the field of education. The President also highlights the importance of initiating a new discussion and raising awareness about the economic and social implications of parent-child interactions and mental health within households. In addition to the enactment of strict laws for child protection, President Ranil Wickremesinghe has also directed his attention toward implementing a separate program in both public and private institutions. This program aims to foster an understanding of a childs mind set and cultivate a society that embraces a broader perspective. The President believes that developing such attitudes within the community will contribute to the well-being of children, according to the PMD.",

        "title": "Opposition parties win big in Thailand election on promises of reform",
        "date": "May 15, 2023 04:43 pm",
        "content": "Ballots tallied Monday showed voters in Thailand wanted change after nine years under a former general who took power in a coup, with the main opposition parties easily besting other contenders in the general election. The opposition Move Forward Party outperformed even optimistic projections and appeared poised to capture almost all 33 House seats in the capital Bangkok. Along with the Pheu Thai Party, the favored opposition group, Move Forward campaigned for reform of the military and the monarchy. Move Forward put those issues closer to the heart of its platform, earning a more radical reputation. Its outspoken support for minor reforms of the monarchy, while winning younger voters, antagonized conservatives committed to the royal institution. Incumbent Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, who came to power in a 2014 coup, was blamed for a stuttering economy, pandemic response shortcomings and thwarting democratic reforms  a particular sore point with younger voters. This is people saying that we want change, said Saowanee T. Alexander, a professor at Ubon Ratchathani University in northeastern Thailand. They are saying that they could no longer take it. The people are very frustrated. They want change, and they could achieve it. With more than 99 of ballots counted early Monday, Move Forward appeared to have a small edge over Pheu Thai, whose leaders conceded Sunday they might not finish on top following voter turnout of about 39 million, or 75 of registered voters. Move Forward leader Pita Limjaroenrat tweeted that he is ready to bring about change should he be the countrys 30th prime minister. Whether you agree or disagree with me, I will be your prime minister. Whether you have voted for me or not, I will serve you, he wrote. Sundays winner is not assured the right to form the new government. A joint session of the 500-seat House of Representatives will be held with the 250-member Senate in July to select the prime minister, a process widely seen as undemocratic because the military appointed the senators, who will vote along with elected lawmakers. Move Forward captured just over 24 of the popular vote for the 400 constituency seats in the House of Representatives and nearly 36 for seats allocated in a separate nationwide ballot for 100 members elected by proportional representation. Pheu Thai lagged slightly behind with just over 23 for constituency seats and about 27 for the party list. The tally of constituency votes gave 113 House seats to Move Forward and 112 to Pheu Thai, according to unofficial results Monday from the Election Commission. Prayuths United Thai Nation Party held the fifth spot in the constituency vote with almost 9 of the total, but placed third in the party-preference tally with close to 12 and 23 House seats in the constituency vote. The three parties were considered the most likely to head a new government. Paetongtarn Shinawatra, the 36-year-old daughter of billionaire former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, was favored in opinion polls to be the countrys next leader. Move Forwards 42-year-old businessman leader Pita now seems a likely prospect. Pheu Thai won the most seats in the 2019 election. But its archrival, the military-backed Palang Pracharath Party, cobbled together a coalition with Prayuth as prime minister and unanimous support from conservative Senate members appointed by the military government after Prayuths coup. Ubon Universitys Alexander cautioned that the current situation remains very unpredictable and the results could be unilaterally affected by the Election Commission, which previously disqualified opposition parties or otherwise undermined challenges to the conservative establishment. She noted the Bhumjaithai Party, which came in third, could be a swing vote since the combined Move Forward and Pheu Thai seats may not be enough for a majority coalition. Bhumjaithai controls a large bloc of votes in the northeast and helped put the military-backed coalition into power. Move Forwards Pita is a possible target for what the opposition, from bitter experience, calls dirty tricks. A Palang Pracharath candidate last week filed a complaint with the Election Commission and the National Anti-Corruption Commission claiming Pita failed to list a stock shareholding on a statutory assets declaration. Pita denied any wrongdoing in the minor, technical claim. However, the leader of the Future Forward Party, forerunner of Move Forward, lost his Parliament seat on similar technical grounds. His party, also considered a radical challenge to the military-backed royalist establishment, was dissolved. Tyrell Haberkorn, a University of Wisconsin Thai studies scholar, said there is a chance street protests could be trigged again if Move Forward meets the same fate as its predecessor. The time is up for the generals and their allies in the palace and the courts. The military can either listen to the voters and step down gracefully, or lead the country into chaos, Haberkorn said.

        "title": "Sri Lankas economic prospects critically hinge on implementation of reform program  IMF",
        "date": "May 15, 2023 05:32 pm",
        "content": "Director of the Asia and Pacific Department of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) Krishna Srinivasan says that Sri Lankas economy is expected to contract by 3 percent in 2023, before registering a modest growth of 1.5 percent in 2024. Mr. Srinivasan made this remark during a special press briefing in Colombo on Monday (15) with the IMF staff team visiting Sri Lanka. He stated that Sri Lanka has been facing a severe crisis because of past policy missteps and back-to-back economic shocks. We have been deeply concerned about the impact of the crisis on the Sri Lankan people, particularly the poor and vulnerable groups, and about the economic costs of the delay in the countrys access to external financing. On March 20, the IMF Executive Board approved a 48-month Extended Fund Facility of about 3 billion U.S. dollars to support Sri Lankas economic policies and reforms. This marked an important step towards the resolution of the crisis, he said. Sri Lanka immediately received an initial disbursement of about 330 from the EFF arrangement, which is expected to catalyze new external financial including from the Asian Development Bank and the World Bank. Given a weak external environment and domestic policy tightening, aimed at restoring macroeconomic stability, the economy is expected to contract by 3 percent in 2023, before registering a modest growth of 1.5 percent in 2024. Prospects hinge quite critically on the implementation of the economic reform program, Mr. Srinivasan said. He further said: As you know well by now, the reform program supported under the EFF arrangement is built on strong policy measures and prioritizes five key pillars. First, an ambitious revenue-based fiscal consolidation, which is accompanied by stronger social safety nets, fiscal institutional reforms, and cost recovery-based energy pricing to ensure the states ability to support all its essential expenditures. Second, restoration of public debt sustainability including through a debt restructuring to ensure stable financing of the governments operations. Third, a multi-pronged strategy to restore price stability and rebuild reserves under greater exchange rate flexibility to alleviate the burden of inflation, particularly on the poor, to foster an environment of investment and growth, and to ensure Sri Lankas ability to purchase essential goods from abroad. Fourth, policies to safeguard financial sector stability, to ensure that the financial sector can play its key role in supporting economic growth. And fifth, structural reforms to address corruption vulnerabilities and enhance growth. Anti-corruption and governance reforms are imperative to ensure the hard-won gains from the reforms benefit the Sri Lankan people. Sri Lanka is the first country in Asia that has undergone the IMF governance diagnostic exercise. The IMF governance diagnostic report is expected to be published by September this yearthe mission visited Colombo in March and engaged closely with stakeholders and civil society organizations on this critical reform area. We look forward to further discussion with them. He added that, commendably, Sri Lanka has already started implementing many of the challenging policy actions in these five areas. It is now essential to continue the reform momentum under strong ownership by the authorities and the Sri Lankan people, more broadly. The IMFs Director of Asia and Pacific Department stressed that economic impact of the reforms on the poor and vulnerable needs to be mitigated with appropriate measures. In this regard, we welcome the authorities firm commitment to strengthen social safety nets, including through a minimum spending floor, well-targeted spending through the new social registry and establishment of objective eligibility criteria. Let me conclude by saying that the IMF supported program is an opportunity for all Sri Lankans to come together to work through this crisis to restore economic stability and put the country on a sustainable growth path. The key is implementation. The IMF is here to help you along the way, he added. Mr. Srinivasan said he is in Colombohis first visit to Sri Lankato further strengthen the IMFs engagement with a broad spectrum of stakeholders in the country. In addition to meeting with the President and top leadership of the country, I have been able to engage with members of the opposition, civil society organizations, trade unions, think tanks, and other stakeholders. He said an IMF staff team, led by Peter Breuer, is also currently in Sri Lanka and will be here until May 23 for regular consultations ahead of the first review mission later this year. The team will communicate further with the media at the end of its visit, he said. The Director of Asia and Pacific Department also said that Sri Lanka is negotiating with both bilateral and private creditors in good faith and that the debt restructuring process is expected to be completed before the first review of the EFF program in September or October this year.",

Emergency services were called to the four-storey Loafers Lodge hostel in Wellington just after midnight local time (12:30 GMT Monday). Dozens were rescued from the building, but police said a number of people remained unaccounted for. Chris Hipkins warned the number of dead was likely to increase. Upon arrival at the blaze, firefighters found the top level of the building ablaze. By 04:00 at least 20 fire trucks were involved in helping extinguish it. Fire and Emergency District commander Nick Pyatt described the fire as Wellingtons worst nightmare. Police warned they could not be more specific on the number of deaths until they could access the building. Mr Pyatt also said the building contained asbestos and urged locals to wear a face mask and keep their windows closed to avoid inhaling the smoke, the New Zealand Herald reported. This is a tragic event for all involved. My heartfelt condolences go to the loved ones of those who have lost their lives, he said. Authorities rescued at least five people from the roof of the burning building and one person sustained serious injuries after jumping from the third floor of the building to escape the flames, local media reported. Mr Hipkins described the fire as tragic to TVNZ and paid tribute to local firefighters who have put themselves in harms way over past hours to get people out of the building and put the fire out, the NZ Herald reported. Its an absolute tragedy and you know, Wellington is a small close-knit community, he said to New Zealands AM show.

        "date": "May 16, 2023 11:14 am",
        "content": "WhatsApp users will soon be able to lock and hide conversations, thanks to a new feature. Chat Lock will remove a chat thread from the apps regular onscreen inbox and place it into a new folder that can only be opened by a password or biometric, such as facial recognition or a fingerprint. Calling it one more layer of security, Meta - WhatsApps parent company - added Chat Lock will protect your most intimate conversations and hide notifications from them. Its the latest in a list of growing features on the globally-used, encrypted messaging service which puts it at odds with the UK governments online safety bill. As part of its privacy package, Meta allows WhatsApp users to encrypt their backups, block the ability to screenshot and make their messages disappear automatically. Mark Zuckerberg, Metas chief executive officer, confirmed the new feature in a Facebook post. He said: New locked chats in WhatsApp make your conversations more private. Theyre hidden in a password protected folder and notifications wont show sender or message content. Meta has criticised the Online Safety Bill, along with other companies. It says the law change would undermine end-to-end encryption - a level of security for messages which means nobody other than the users involved in the conversation is able to see its content. The company has previously warned it would sooner see British users stopped from using its services than risk compromising their privacy. But a government spokesperson insisted the bill will not require companies to break end-to-end encryption or routinely monitor private communications. Some have characterised this as a binary choice between privacy and safety: this is wrong, the spokesperson added. They continued: We support strong encryption, but this cannot come at the cost of public safety. Tech companies have a moral duty to ensure they are not blinding themselves and law enforcement to criminality on their platforms. As a result of our pro-innovation approach, we are confident technology can support the implementation of end-to-end encryption in such a way that can protect children from abuse online, while respecting user privacy. Some charities, including the NSPCC, also say they support the aims of the bill and surveys suggest it has the backing of large numbers of British adults. However, UK-based messaging platform Element, used by the likes of the Ministry of Defence, US Marine Corps, and Ukraines armed forces, claimed the bill was outright dangerous and would weaken national security. Elements chief executive Matthew Hodgson said: Bad actors dont play by the rules. Rogue nation states, terrorists, and criminals will target that access with every resource they have. Mr Hodgson added: Its a shock to see the UK, a country that symbolises democracy and freedom, introducing routine mass surveillance and fundamentally undermining encryption. Bad actors will simply continue to use existing unregulated apps - and good actors using compliant apps will have their privacy undermined. The wide-ranging legislation aims to regulate internet content to keep people safe, and would give media regulator Ofcom the power to demand that platforms identify and remove child abuse content. Refusing to comply could see companies face huge fines. Source - Sky News -Agencies",

        "content": "Nigerian chef Hilda Effiong Bassey has become a national sensation after cooking nonstop for 100 hours, in an attempt to set a world record. The chef, known on social media as Hilda Baci, started cooking on Thursday and continued until Monday  creating more than 55 recipes and over 100 meals designed to showcase the best of Nigerian cuisine in the marathon kitchen session. The Guinness world record committee still has to confirm that all their criteria have been met and whether Bassey will become the record holder. The record to beat  87 hours and 45 minutes  was set in 2019 by Indian chef Lata Tondon who posted a message of support to Bassey ahead of her attempt. Bassey told CNN that she was motivated to attempt the record because she wants to put Nigerian food on the map. Nigerian cuisine is the best out there, she said. The more recipes are propagated, the more people will be willing to try it. Nigerian food is such comfort food, she added. Despite the lack of sleep throughout her cooking spree in Lagos, Bassey remained in high spirits and could be spotted dancing and waving at her fans turned out in droves to support her. One man, Uduak Obong, told CNN he took a bus journey through the night, traveling hundreds of kilometers to arrive at the venue in Lagos. I drove 12 hours to be right here to support my sister, my friend. Shes just amazing, he said. Eniola Adeoluwa, a media personality, who also doubled as MC for the cookathon told CNN: When a Nigerian is doing something we all come out to show support We are super excited. Shes doing such an amazing job. Shes opening the door to the African food market and showing all the youth out here that if you can dream it, you can achieve it, Damilola Ogunsi said. Celebrities including musician Tiwa Savage and local politicians visited Bassey during the cooking challenge. Bassey told CNN that she nearly gave up on the first day, but after surpassing the previous record, she decided to aim for 100 hours. The first day was the most difficult. I was ready to give up 6 hours in. I feel like a miracle happened and somehow I got to this. The support has been incredible, she said. Source - CNN -Agencies",

        "content": "The Government of Japan through the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) is providing USD 4,629,629 to strengthen the production capacity of smallholder paddy farmers in identified districts of the Dry and Intermediate Zones of Sri Lanka. Smallholder farmers are amongst the most vulnerable rural communities, predominantly cultivating rice for self-consumption. Lack of fertilizer over two consecutive seasons caused major yield drops forcing some farmers to undertake negative coping strategies (pawning, buying on credit, dipping into savings, etc.) to meet their food security and nutrition requirements. Issuing a statement, the FAO said that through the initiative, approximately 250,000 smallholder paddy farmers cultivating paddy on land holdings up to one hectare in identified districts of the Dry and Intermediate zones will receive up to 50kgs of urea fertilizer each for the upcoming Maha cropping season. The fertilizer will be provided free of cost and distribution will be carried out with the support of the Ministry of Agriculture and the Department of Agrarian Development. The project will also provide smallholder paddy farmers with sensitization material on the efficient use of fertilizer to maximize production. MIZUKOSHI Hideaki, Ambassador of Japan to Sri Lanka, said, We are pleased to announce that the Government of Japan has decided to provide additional humanitarian assistance to procure fertilizer, which is in short supply due to the shortage of foreign exchange. We hope that this support will improve food production capacity in Sri Lanka to pre-crisis levels, ensuring better livelihoods for smallholder farmers and stable access to essential food for all citizens across the country. Speaking on the initiative, Vimlendra Sharan, FAO Representative for Sri Lanka and the Maldives stated, As FAO we are working with our partners and advocating at every level to ensure that vulnerable farmers and fishers are able to continue their livelihoods. While the status of food security and nutrition in Sri Lanka is looking brighter, it may take three to four more cultivation seasons to fully recover. We thank the Government of Japan for supporting Sri Lanka in its recovery and have no doubt that the support provided will help boost production for 2023.",

The order was issued by a three-judge bench of the Supreme Court comprising of Justices Vijith Malalgoda, Yasantha Kodagoda and Arjun Obeysekera. upon presentation of the facts. Appearing on behalf of the petitioner, Presidents Counsel Faizer Mustapha informed the court that his clients arrest was entirely in defiance of the law, as no sufficient evidence had been produced against his client at the time of the arrest. The lawyer further stated that the arrest and detention of his client under the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA) was also non-compliant with the law. Speaking in open court, however, the three-judge bench chaired by Justice Malalgoda pointed out that two weeks after the Easter Sunday terror attacks of 2019, large sums of money were transferred to and from the petitioners bank accounts, as per the statements obtained from the relevant banks. Thus, they noted that the arrest was therefore not illegal on any account, as it was made pertaining to the ongoing investigations into the series of bomb attacks at the time. Justice Malalgoda further noted that Dr. Shafi had not provided sufficient details as to where the money in question came from when he was questioned by the police prior to his arrest, thereby adding that the court cannot interfere with police investigations. Thus, upon presentation of several other facts to the court in this regard, the Supreme Court dismissed the FR petition filed by Dr. Shafi seeking an order declaring that his arrest in May 2019 and detention thereon was unlawful. Albeit the Police having stated that Dr. Shafi was arrested and remanded for allegedly amassing assets via suspicious means and performing illegal sterilisation surgeries, the petitioner emphasised that the police failed to mention any substantial reason for his arrest. Thus, he also requested that the court issue an order stating that his fundamental rights were violated by arresting and detaining him based on false and baseless allegation.",

        "date": "May 17, 2023 08:44 am",
        "content": "Presidents Secretary, Saman Ekanayake has issued instructions to the Ministry of Health, urging them to continue implementing dengue control programs in collaboration with the Dengue Control Task Force. Accordingly, the Ministry of Health has launched a comprehensive program nationwide to combat the spread of dengue, the Presidents Media Division (PMD) says. Dr. Nalin Ariyaratne, the Director of the National Dengue Control Unit, has reported an increase of approximately 2,000 dengue cases from the first quarter of last year to the present, extending up to 2023. He has expressed concern over the possibility of surpassing last years record of 11,000 cases reported in June and July. The health authorities are working diligently to prevent a similar situation this year. Meanwhile, to mitigate the spread of dengue, the Ministry of Health has proposed the designation of every Friday as a cleaning day. This measure aims to reduce the prevalence of dengue by emphasizing cleanliness and eliminating breeding grounds for mosquitoes. According to the latest data from the National Dengue Control Program, there have been 22 reported deaths and 34,511 dengue cases across the island from January 2023 to May 16. The highest number of cases, amounting to 17,049, has been reported in the Western Province. Specifically, the Gampaha District has reported 7,797 cases, the Colombo District 7,219 cases, and the Kalutara District 2,033 cases. Additionally, the Puttalam District recorded 2,463 cases. Furthermore, the National Dengue Control Program has identified 59 Medical Officers of Health (MoH) Divisions across the island as Dengue High-Risk Zones. Meanwhile, the Ministry of Health has advised the heads of government institutions, schools, and other establishments to inspect and clean potential mosquito breeding sites. It has recommended regular inspections of residential and commercial premises in urban and rural areas and the use of loudspeakers to disseminate information, the identification of dengue patients, and the implementation of necessary measures such as fumigation and on-site inspections to destroy dengue-carrying mosquitoes and larvae. The authorities have pledged to take legal action against individuals and institutions failing to maintain cleanliness. The health department emphasizes that the success of the dengue control program depends not only on their intervention but also on the support of the general public. Active participation and cooperation from the community are vital to effectively combat the spread of dengue.",

The meeting was chaired by MP Nalaka Bandara Kottegoda. There was a discussion at length regarding the production of skilled professionals in the field of welding and related technology in Sri Lanka. The members of the committee pointed out that there is a great demand for experts in this field in industrialized countries including Korea and the need for a formal mechanism to produce skilled workers with formal certificates in the said field. Officials mentioned that the training and certification system for those who already have professional experience in this sector and those who are new entrants to the field is conducted at the training centre run by the board. However, since there is no proper awareness among the people about this training, the committee advised to prepare a plan and take steps to make awareness and involve more young people. It was also discussed that Saudi Arabia hopes to get preserved coconut coir from Sri Lanka for the project of planting 10 billion trees in Saudi Arabia.

Making a special statement today (May 17), the president of the association Upul Rohana emphasized that the people need to follow the health guidelines again for their own safety. A viral illness and also a condition that can be suspected of being Covid-19 are widespread at present at the ground level. Especially, it is spreading like an epidemic within schools and other institutions. Therefore, we, the general public must act responsibly at the moment, he said. Mr. Upul Rohana, who mentioned that it is important to follow the previously introduced Covid-19 prevention guidelines such as washing hands and maintaining a clear respiratory system, also highlighted that limiting unnecessary gatherings and making sure to wear face masks once again will help to safeguard ones own health. There is no system to confirm the patients at the ground level in order to understand whether the current situation is caused by Covid-19 infection, or whether it could exacerbate to an epidemic situation that will ultimately result in a calamity, he claimed. This infection is confirmed only when the patients are hospitalized and only in deceased patients. Therefore, we suspect that the Covid-19 disease is spreading to some extent at the ground level. Therefore, it is very important to strictly follow all the health guidelines given earlier for the safety of your lives, he added.",

        "date": "May 17, 2023 01:24 pm",
        "content": "The powerful cyclone that hit Myanmar on Sunday has killed at least 40 people, locals have told the BBC, and the toll may rise further. Cyclone Mocha was one of the strongest storms to make landfall in the region this century, packing winds of about 209kmh (130mph). Most confirmed deaths are in Rakhine state, in central Myanmar, others in Sagaing and Magway regions. The military have announced 21 deaths nationwide. Unconfirmed reports put the death toll much higher, especially in camps where the internally displaced Rohingya minority live. It is thought those casualties are not being counted by the military junta which seized power in a 2021 coup. Hundreds of homes and shelters have collapsed. Communication has been difficult in the country, and people are still missing, so death toll estimates vary. In Sittwe, the capital city in Rakhine state, where many people live in low-lying coastal areas, roads have been blocked by uprooted trees and fallen power pylons. In other, less peaceful, areas of the country there are also reports of military attacks on locals following the storm. Thousands of people have fled their homes in the north-western Sagaing region as the army entered villages under cover of the cyclone. It has been raining since 12 May, we had run from the overflowing streams, a resident in the regions Kani township told the BBC. The soldiers also punched. Residents are fearing the danger of the soldiers more than the danger of the storm. Locals who the BBC spoke to estimate that some 15,000 residents from the Kani and Khin Oo townships have been affected by military attacks in the last two days. They said a four-year-old boy in Inpa village was receiving medical treatment after being hit by a bullet. Myanmar is facing a storm on many fronts, with reports that the Myanmar army attacked villages in other regions while Cyclone Mocha unfolded in Rakhine state. The needs of families continue to be great, NGO Partners Relief  Development, which works in the cyclone-hit Rakhine state, said in a Twitter post on Tuesday. Communities in Sagaing have put up some of the strongest opposition to the military. The division also houses a large number of anti-coup militias, known as the Peoples Defence Force. There were no immediate reports of casualties in neighbouring Bangladesh, but the category five storm crushed thousands of shelters in the worlds largest refugee camp at Coxs Bazar. It is home to one million Rohingya refugees from Myanmar. About 750,000 people fled low-lying areas ahead of Mochas landfall last Sunday. It came 15 years after one of Asias deadliest cyclones, Nargis, smashed into Myanmars Irrawaddy Delta and claimed 140,000 lives. Cyclones are the equivalent of hurricanes in the Atlantic and typhoons in the Pacific. Scientists say these storms have become stronger and more frequent due to climate change.

In an Instagram post, Pastor Jerome indicated that he would be returning to the island within the week, in order to host a service on Sunday titled Mega Church Day. An overseas travel ban was imposed against the Pastor on orders of the Colombo Fort Magistrates Court yesterday (16 May), as per a request made by the Criminal Investigation Department (CID). Fernando, however, left the island on 14 May after making several controversial remarks regarding religions including Buddhism, Islam and Hinduism, during a recent sermon of his. A video of the sermon in question was recently widely circulated on social media, stirring much controversy within the country due to allegations that it included derogatory statements related to Lord Buddha and other religious figures. On 15 May, President Ranil Wickremesinghe ordered the CID to launch an immediate investigation into the matter, citing that such statements could create religious conflicts and harm the countrys harmony. The New Buddhist Front (Nawa Bikshu Peramuna) and the Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) also lodged a complaint with the CID, seeking the immediate arrest of the Pastor and that strict legal action be initiated against him.",

        "date": "May 17, 2023 02:23 pm",
        "content": "Chief Inspector Gamage Nilantha, who served as the OIC of the Mount Lavinia Crimes Investigation Unit and carried out many raids and operations pertaining to the arrests of drug traffickers, has been transferred to Negombo. Accordingly, Police sources revealed that the senior officer, who also carried out the arrest of Kotiya in connection with the murder of former Dehiwala - Mount Lavinia Municipal Council member Ranjan de Silva, was transferred unanticipatedly. They further revealed that such transfers are likely the work of organised crime syndicates of the underworld, explaining that such transfers were orchestrated by these criminals in a bid to evade arrest. Members of such syndicates allegedly take hold of and later coerce officers of the police intelligence units into submitting reports containing false information on certain officers responsible for successful drug raids and operations in this regard to senior officials, which ultimately result in such unorthodox transfers, Police sources claimed. Malindu Lakmal, alias Kotiya, was arrested by Chief Inspector Gamage Nilantha in January this year over the murder of Ranjan de Silva, father of Sri Lankan cricketer Dhananjaya de Silva, who was gunned down in May 2018. Kotiya is a known associate of the ill-famed underworld figure Sinhara Amal Saminda Silva, alias Kudu Anju, who is currently in the custody of the French Police. Thus, subsequent to Kotiyas arrest, the Chief Inspector had reportedly received a threatening phone call, while graffiti of this nature had also been left on the walls of his house. Chief Inspector Gamage, who had also carried out operations pertaining to the arrest of Badowita Nalin, also an associate of Kudu Anju, and the prevention of several other underworld activities within the Mt. Lavinia police division, later informed the Kesbewa court of the threats received. However, Police sources claim that the transfer was likely due to the Chief Inspectors extensive involvement in apprehending those related to the underworld and organised crime syndicates, and thus urge that senior police officials tend to this racket immediately.",

        "date": "May 17, 2023 03:25 pm",
        "content": "Frances former president Nicolas Sarkozy lost his case on Wednesday against a 2021 conviction for corruption and influence peddling at the Paris Court of Appeals. The court upheld a sentence of three years with two years suspended; he will wear an electronic bracelet for the remaining year instead of going to prison. Sarkozy has vowed to appeal the verdict at Frances Supreme Court. The 68-year-old, who served one term from 2007 to 2012, has been embroiled in legal troubles ever since leaving office. In March 2021 he was sentenced to three years in prison  two of them suspended and one at home with an electronic bracelet  for corruption and influence peddling through a secret telephone line that was discovered through wiretapping. The court found that Sarkozy and his former lawyer, Thierry Herzog, had formed a corruption pact with a judge, Gilbert Azibert, to obtain and share information about a legal investigation. Investigators had wiretapped Sarkozys two official phone lines. They discovered that he had a third unofficial one taken out in 2014 under the name Paul Bismuth, through which he communicated with Herzog. The contents of these phone calls led to the 2021 corruption verdict. Sarkozy contested the accusations and immediately appealed against his conviction. On the first day of the appeals hearing in December last year, he said he had never corrupted anybody. His conversations with Herzog have now been played in court for the first time and will be central in determining Wednesdays ruling. The prosecutors office had requested that Sarkozy, Herzog and Azibert each be handed a three-year suspended sentence. They had also asked for Sarkozy and Azibert, 76, to be suspended from public office and Herzog, 67, to be banned from practising law, each for five years. Two other cases The so-called Bismuth case is just one of several pursuing the man dubbed the hyper-president while in office. Sarkozy will be retried on appeal from November 2023 in the so-called Bygmalion case, which saw him sentenced to one year in prison at first instance. The prosecution accused Sarkozys team of spending nearly double the legal limit on his lavish 2012 re-election campaign, using false billing from a public relations firm called Bygmalion. He has denied any wrongdoing. And French prosecutors on Thursday demanded he face a new trial over alleged Libyan financing of his 2007 election campaign. Frances financial crimes prosecutors said Sarkozy and 12 others should face trial over accusations they sought millions of euros in financing from the regime of then Libyan leader Moamer Kadhafi for his ultimately victorious campaign. Sarkozy is accused of corruption, illegal campaign financing and concealing the embezzlement of public funds but has always rejected all the charges. Investigating magistrates are to have the last word on whether or not that trial goes ahead. Despite his legal problems, Sarkozy still enjoys considerable influence and popularity on the right of French politics and has the ear of incumbent President Emmanuel Macron.

        "title": "President hopeful of rectifying past mistakes and surpassing IMF goals",
        "date": "May 17, 2023 07:13 pm",
        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe, during a meeting with Ministry Secretaries and Provincial Chief Secretaries, expressed confidence that the proper implementation of the governments policy program would lead to economic prosperity surpassing the goals set by the International Monetary Fund. He stressed the need for collective effort to address the concerns raised by the youth regarding the countrys economy and their future. The President emphasized the importance of restructuring state-owned companies to ensure a prosperous economy and urged ministry secretaries to support the governments policy program rather than protecting companies under their jurisdictions. He also highlighted the forthcoming regulations on capital expenditure and projects of Provincial Councils, with decisions on power distribution at the local level expected within the next few months. The meeting covered the progress of budget proposals, the performance of ministry secretaries, and discussions on public enterprise reconciliation, public service management, and the economy. Detailed deliberations were held on law amendments related to policy changes in the interim budget and the 2023 budget presented in Parliament, as well as bills associated with obligations to the Asian Development Bank, World Bank, and International Monetary Fund. Following is the full context of the Presidents speech; As the President, I acknowledge that every ministry shares responsibility for the economic bankruptcy our country faces today. In the past, ministries were tasked with allocating funds for various activities, but unfortunately, this often led to the squandering of peoples hard-earned money. It is understandable that the youth are questioning the state of our nation, and it is our duty as politicians and administrative officials to provide them with answers. While we cannot change what has already transpired, we have the power to reverse this situation. In the past, our government has successfully rebuilt the economy, such as in 1977 when we took over and revitalized the country, and again in 2001 when we led the government and achieved a rapid economic recovery by 2004. With the proper implementation of our current program, we have the potential to surpass the goals set by the International Monetary Fund and achieve remarkable progress. One of our key objectives is the restructuring of public corporations, particularly the main company that oversees them. We will carefully assess these entities and retain some under government control, while allowing private companies to acquire the remaining shares. It is crucial that we receive maximum support in this endeavour to ensure the effective restructuring of these companies. Regarding youth development, the functions of the Youth Service Council, the National Apprenticeship Board, and the Vocational Training Authority may be merged for greater efficiency. Additionally, we propose that the Vocational Training Centres, which are spread across the islands, be placed under the supervision of the Provincial Councils. Hence, it is essential for each ministry to determine how to implement the governments policies. I anticipate reviewing the progress made in a months time. We must also introduce new regulations concerning capital expenditure and capital projects of the Provincial Councils. Simultaneously, decisions pertaining to devolving power at the grassroots level must be expedited within the coming months. Let us swiftly address these matters. In terms of education, our initial plan was to grant authority to the Provincial Councils. However, circumstances have unfolded differently. Similarly, the Ministry of Agriculture and the Provincial Council share responsibilities in the agricultural sector. We should consider transferring these powers to the Provincial Councils. There is no requirement that mandates these powers to remain solely under the National Ministry. By granting such authority, the National Ministry can effectively coordinate with the Provincial Councils. At present, we have around 30 ministries. Let us maintain this number and avoid further expansion. The amalgamation of the local government and state administration into one ministry is a positive development. Similarly, we have successfully unified irrigation and canal management. By the end of next year, we should strive to bring plantation industries and agriculture under one ministry. Moreover, I propose that international trade and foreign affairs be consolidated. This restructuring process should commence promptly, and we have the capacity to complete several activities by next year. Our first priority is the implementation of the International Monetary Funds proposals. We cannot evade this responsibility and must move forward accordingly. By adhering to these proposals, we can establish economic stability. Subsequently, we need to focus on repaying the loan. This necessitates embarking on a rapid development program, with a targeted completion date of 2048. It is undeniable that every ministry shares responsibility for the current state of our countrys economic affairs. We must acknowledge that allocating funds to certain activities in the past has resulted in the misuse of public funds. It is only fair for the youth to question what has transpired. Presidential Senior Adviser on National Security and Chief of Presidential Staff Mr Sagala Ratnayake, Presidents Secretary Mr Saman Ekanayake, Presidential Senior Adviser on Economic Affairs Dr. R.H.S. Samaratunga, and Cabinet Secretary Mr W.M.D.J. Fernando were also present.",

Appearing for the Director General of Health Services, Additional Solicitor General Wikum de Abrew raised the objection when a writ petition filed by the Western Hospital in Borella seeking an interim order for the annulment of the decision taken by the health chief was taken up. The petition was taken up for hearing before the Appeals Court judge bench consisting of the President of the Court of Appeal, Nissanka Bandula Karunaratne and Justice A. Marikkar today. There, Presidents Counsel Faiszer Mustapha, who was representing the hospital in question, mentioned that he expects to present facts related to a request seeking interim relief for the decision taken by the Director General of Health Services. However, Additional Solicitor General Wikum de Abrew, who raised objections to the request, also stated that such requests for interim relief cannot be approved when this petition has been fixed for hearing. He further pointed out that it is not possible to request an interim relief without submitting the counterstatements related to the case. The Appeals Court judge bench, who took all presented facts into consideration, ordered the hearing of the case to be recalled on May 22, 2023.",

        "title": "G-7 Hiroshima Summit 2023: Focus likely on war in Ukraine and tensions in Asia",
        "date": "May 17, 2023 08:55 pm",
        "content": "The symbolism will be palpable when leaders of the worlds rich democracies sit down in Hiroshima, a city whose name evokes the tragedy of war, to tackle a host of challenges including Russias invasion of Ukraine and rising tensions in Asia. The attention on the war in Europe comes just days after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy completed a whirlwind trip to meet many of the Group of Seven leaders now heading to Japan for the summit starting Friday. That tour was aimed at adding to his countrys weapons stockpile and building political support ahead of a widely anticipated counteroffensive to reclaim lands occupied by Moscows forces. Ukraine has driven this sense of common purpose for the G-7, said Matthew P. Goodman, senior vice president for economics at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. He said the new commitments Zelenskyy received just ahead of the summit could push members of the bloc to step up their support even further. Theres a kind of peer pressure that develops in forums like this, he explained. G-7 leaders are also girding for the possibility of renewed conflict in Asia as relations with China deteriorate. They are increasingly concerned, among other things, about what they see as Beijings growing assertiveness, and fear that China could could try to seize Taiwan by force, sparking a wider conflict. China claims the self-governing island as its own and regularly sends ships and warplanes near it. Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida also hopes to highlight the risks of nuclear proliferation during the meeting in Hiroshima, the site of the worlds first atomic bombing. The prospect of another nuclear attack has been crystalized by nearby North Koreas nuclear program and spate of recent missile tests, and Russias threats to use nuclear weapons in its war in Ukraine. China, meanwhile, is rapidly expanding its nuclear arsenal from an estimated 400 warheads today to 1,500 by 2035, according to Pentagon estimates. Concerns about the strength of the global economy, rising prices and the debt limit crisis in the U.S. will be high on leaders minds. G-7 finance ministers and central bank chiefs meeting ahead of the summit pledged to enforce sanctions against Russia, tackle rising inflation, bolster financial systems and help countries burdened by heavy debts. The G-7 includes the United States, Japan, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Canada and Italy, as well as the European Union. That group is also lavishing more attention on the needs of the Global South  a term to describe mostly developing countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America  and has invited countries ranging from South American powerhouse Brazil to the tiny Cook Islands in the South Pacific. By broadening the conversation beyond the worlds richest industrialized nations, the group hopes to strengthen political and economic ties while shoring up support for efforts to isolate Russia and stand up to Chinas assertiveness around the world, analysts say. Japan was shocked when scores of developing countries were reluctant to condemn Russia for its invasion of Ukraine last year, said Mireya Solís, director of the Center for East Asian Policy Studies at The Brookings Institution. Tokyo believes that this act of war by a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council is a direct threat to the foundations of the postwar international system. Getting a diverse set of countries to uphold principles like not changing borders by force advances Japans foreign policy priorities, and makes good economic sense since their often unsustainable debt loads and rising prices for food and energy are a drag on the global economy, she continued. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi will also be attending. His country, which is overtaking China as the worlds most populous and sees itself as a rising superpower, is playing host to a meeting of the much broader group of G-20 leading economies later this year. For host Kishida, this weekends meeting is an opportunity to spotlight his countrys more robust foreign policy. The Japanese prime minister made a surprise trip to Kyiv in March, making him the countrys first postwar leader to travel to a war zone, a visit freighted with symbolism given Japans pacifist constitution but one that he was under domestic pressure to take. Another notable inclusion in Hiroshima is South Korea, a fellow U.S. ally that has rapidly drawn closer to its former colonial occupier Japan as their relations thawed in the face of shared regional security concerns. U.S. President Joe Biden is expected to hold a separate three-way meeting with his Japanese and South Korean counterparts. Sung-Yoon Lee, an East Asia expert at Tufts Universitys Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy, said that meeting sends a message to China, Russia and North Korea of solidarity among the democracies in the region and their resolve to stand up to the increasingly threatening autocracies. Biden had been expected to make a historic stop in Papua New Guinea and then travel onward to Australia after the Hiroshima meeting, but he scrapped those latter two stops Tuesday to focus on the debt limit debate back in Washington. The centerpiece of the Australia visit was a meeting of the Quad, a regional security grouping that the U.S. sees as a counterweight to Chinas actions in the region. Beijing has criticized the group as an Asian version of the NATO military alliance. The decision to host the G-7 in Hiroshima is no accident. Kishida, whose family is from the city, hopes the venue will underscore Japans commitment to world peace and build momentum to realize the ideal of a world without nuclear weapons, he wrote on the online news site Japan Forward. The United States dropped an atomic bomb on Hiroshima on Aug. 6, 1945, destroying the city and killing 140,000 people, then dropped a second on Nagasaki three days later, killing another 70,000. Japan surrendered on Aug. 15, effectively ending World War II and decades of Japanese aggression in Asia. The shell and skeletal dome of one of the riverside buildings that survived the Hiroshima blast are the focal point of the Peace Memorial Park, which leaders are expected to visit.

        "date": "May 18, 2023 07:43 am",
        "content": "Sri Lankan cricketer Danushka Gunathilaka has had three out of his four sexual assault charges dropped relating to the alleged sexual assault of a woman in her home in Sydneys eastern suburbs. The 32-year-old was facing four counts of sexual intercourse without consent while in Sydney for the T20 World Cup, but the public prosecutor withdrew three of the charges in a Sydney court on Thursday. The batsman allegedly met up with the 29-year-old woman for a date in November 2022 before raping her when they returned to her home in Sydneys eastern suburbs. A police facts sheet filed with the court said the woman was fearing for her life and could not get away from the accused during the November 2022 incident. The prosecution successfully applied last month for an adjournment, which took the hearing beyond the six-month requirement for charge certification. Gunathilakas lawyer, Alen Sahinovic, opposed the delay, arguing his client was being subjected to undue hardship as a foreign citizen with strict bail conditions and limited familial and social support. Gunathilaka travelled to Australia with Sri Lankas T20 World Cup team last year but only played in their first game before being ruled out of the competition with a hamstring tear. He was arrested in the early hours of 6 November at Sydneys Hyatt Regency hotel, shortly before he was scheduled to board a flight home with the rest of the team after they bowed out of the tournament. Police say Gunathilaka, who attended Downing Centre Local Court on Thursday, and the 29-year-old woman met through Tinder. Prosecutor Hugh Buddin, for the Director of Public Prosecutions, told the court that one charge had been certified but the remaining three counts of sexual intercourse without consent had been withdrawn. Magistrate Clare Farnan formally dismissed the counts. Gunathilakas solicitor Alen Sahinovic said the parties were yet to have a case conference and asked for the matter to return to court on July 13. He said he expects it to proceed to committal on that date. Source: Australian Associated Press  SMH --Agencies",

        "date": "May 18, 2023 08:52 am",
        "content": "Sri Lanka Navy has seized a multiday fishing trawler carrying approximately 121kg of heroin and hashish with an estimated street value of around Rs. 2,800 million and also arrested 06 suspects in southern seas. Based on information derived from a coordinated intelligence operation conducted by the State Intelligence Service and Sri Lanka Navy, a local multiday fishing trawler carrying about 111kg and 606g of heroin (including packages) and about 10kg and 254g (including packages) of hashish was intercepted by SLNS Vijayabahu on 13th May. The special operation mounted about 413 nautical miles (about 764km) off Dondra, South of Sri Lanka, also led to the apprehension of 06 suspects involved in this illegal act, the navy said. The Commander of the Navy, Vice Admiral Priyantha Perera, arrived at the Colombo Harbour this morning (18) to personally inspect the seized consignment of narcotics. During this dedicated operation led by the Naval Intelligence and State Intelligence Service, the Offshore Patrol Vessel SLNS Vijayabahu intercepted the local fishing trawler on suspicion and discovered a staggering amount of illegal drugs on board. The haul of narcotics included about 111kg and 606g (including packages) of heroin which were in ninety nine (99) parcels stuffed in five (05) sacks and about 10kg and 254g (including packages) of hashish in 09 packages. Meanwhile, the Navy also nabbed 06 Sri Lankan nationals aboard. The street value of the seized consignment of drugs is believed to be around Rs 2,800 million. On the sidelines of this operation, the Navy, State Intelligence Service and Police Narcotic Bureau (PNB) are conducting further operation to apprehend another group of suspects in connection to the ground network of this drug-racket, the statement said. The suspects apprehended in this operation have been identified as residents of Negombo, Iranawila, Andigama and Minuwangoda areas while they are between 29 and 58 years of age. The suspects and the stock of heroin will be handed over to the Police Narcotic Bureau for onward legal action, the navy said. Including the latest seizure, the Sri Lanka Navy has apprehended drugs with a gross street value of over Rs. 7,603 million during operations mounted in 2023.",

        "date": "May 18, 2023 09:47 am",
        "content": "Prince Harry, Meghan Markle and her mother were involved in a near catastrophic car chase involving paparazzi, a spokesperson for the couple claimed. The incident happened after the Duke and Duchess of Sussex attended an awards ceremony in New York on Tuesday. In a statement, their spokesperson said the relentless pursuit lasted for more than two hours and resulted in multiple near collisions. The New York Police Department (NYPD) said there were no arrests or injuries. BBC News has not been able to independently verify all the details. But accounts and information developed throughout the day on Wednesday. The NYPD confirmed an incident took place involving Harry and Meghan and said numerous photographers made their transport challenging. No injuries or arrests were reported, the police said. Buckingham Palace has not yet commented. Entertainment picture agency Backgrid issued a statement saying it was investigating the conduct of several freelance photographers, but that their initial account of events differed to that of the Sussexes. The photographers have reported feeling that the couple was not in immediate danger at any point, it said. It followed claims the chase involved half a dozen cars, with reckless driving including going through red lights, driving on the pavement, carrying out blocking moves, and reversing down a one-way street - as well as taking photographs while driving. BBC News understands Harry and Meghan were staying at a friends home, and did not return directly to avoid compromising their security. The couple and Meghans mother, Doria Ragland, tried to take shelter from the paparazzi by going to a Manhattan police station. There was then a plan to use a New York taxi, with a yellow cab flagged down and Harry, Meghan, Ms Ragland and a security officer getting inside. But the vehicle and its occupants were spotted by photographers and they reverted to their own security vehicles. Cab driver Sukhcharn Singh, who goes by the name Sonny, told BBC News he picked up the four passengers on 67th Street between Lexington Avenue and 3rd Avenue. A security guard hailed me, next thing you know Prince Harry and his wife were hopping into my cab, he said. As we went a block, we got blocked by a garbage truck and all of a sudden paparazzi came and started taking pictures. They were just about to give me the location of where they were going to go, but then they told me to circle back to the precinct. He said they were nice people who looked nervous. He thought claims of a near catastrophic chase might have been exaggerated, saying that he did not think the paparazzi were being aggressive. The award ceremony they attended - the Ms Foundation Women of Vision Awards - was Harry and Meghans first public appearance together since the King Charles Coronation earlier this month. Meghan accepted an award at the event alongside LaTosha Brown, the co-founder of Black Voters Matter. New York City Mayor Eric Adams told reporters that two police officers could have been injured and that it would be horrific to lose an innocent bystander during a chase like this. Prince Harry and Meghans statement had never claimed there was a high-speed chase. It spoke of a relentless pursuit for more than two hours. Duncan Larcombe, the author of the book Prince Harry: the Inside Story, told BBC News it appeared something has gone extremely wrong with Harry and Meghans security in the US. This will come as a huge surprise for people who used to look after Harry in the UK, he said. There are huge questions to be asked about whether the paparazzi can still operate in this way. Prince Harrys mother, Princess Diana, was killed in a 1997 car crash in Paris while being chased by photographers. In an interview with the BBC for the documentary Diana, 7 Days, Prince Harry referred to the paparazzi as a pack of dogs who constantly hounded his mother. Every single time she went out thered be a pack of people waiting for her, he said. I mean a pack of dogs, followed her, chased her, harassed her, called her names, spat at her, trying to get a reaction, to get that photograph of her lashing out. Prince Harry is currently involved in multiple legal disputes with the British tabloid press, including allegations of phone hacking and the unlawful gathering of information. Earlier this week, a lawyer for the prince told a London court that he should be allowed to challenge a government decision that denied him the ability to pay for police protection while in the country. The pair stepped down from royal duties and moved to the US in 2020 - a move they said was partly due to harassment from UK tabloids. Prince Harry has described his battle to change the media as his lifes work. Next month he will appear in a London court to give evidence in a phone-hacking case. Source: BBC -Agencies",

        "title": "Global warming expected to cross 1.5C threshold for the first time: WMO",
        "date": "May 18, 2023 11:52 am",
        "content": "For the first time ever, global temperatures are now more likely than not to breach 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7F) of warming within the next five years, the World Meteorological Organization said on Wednesday. But that did not necessarily mean the world would cross the long-term warming threshold of 1.5C above preindustrial levels set out in the 2015 Paris Agreement. With a 66 per cent chance of temporarily reaching 1.5C by 2027, its the first time in history that its more likely than not that we will exceed 1.5C, said Adam Scaife, head of long-range prediction at Britains Met Office Hadley Centre who worked on the WMOs latest Global Annual to Decadal Climate Update. Last years report put the odds at about 50-50. Partially responsible for boosting the chance of hitting 1.5C is an El Niño weather pattern expected to develop in the coming months. During this natural phenomenon, warmer waters in the tropical Pacific heat the atmosphere above, spiking global temperatures. The El Niño will combine with human-induced climate change to push global temperatures into uncharted territory, said WMO Secretary-General Petteri Taalas in a press statement. Still, the likelihood of temporarily exceeding 1.5C has increased over time. Between 2017 and 2021, for example, scientists estimated just a 10 per cent chance of hitting 1.5C. Unlike the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Changes climate projections which are based on future greenhouse gas emissions, the WMO update provides more of a prediction-based long-range weather forecast. The WMO also found a 98 per cent chance that one of the next five years will be the hottest on record, surpassing 2016 which saw global temperature impacted by about 1.3C (2.3F) of warming.

People are resorting to the use of this type of analgesics (painkillers) as a treatment for high fever and body pain as well as headache, as per the Health Promotion Bureau. The use of Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAID), which are widely used to relieve pain, reduce inflammation, and bring down high body temperature, without proper medical advice from a physician is totally unacceptable, the health authorities cautioned. Furthermore, the Health Promotion Bureau highlighted that the relevant type of analgesic drugs manufactured under several brand names such as Ibuprofen, Mefenamic acid, Indomethacin, Naproxen, Celecoxib and Aspirin, are widely used in Sri Lanka. Health authorities warn that although such drugs are good pain relievers, using them for dengue infection can lead to complications and even death. The Health Promotion Bureau points out that if anyone has fever these days, they must rest well and consume plenty of fluids, and instructs only to use the correct dosage of Paracetamol as medication. If fever persists for more than two days, people are advised to immediately visit a doctor or a hospital and to refrain from using steroidal drugs such as Prednisolone and Dexamethasone to treat fever without a physicians advice.",

        "date": "May 18, 2023 03:32 pm",
        "content": "The sari is being reinvented for the modern age in an Indian fashion revolution, with around 60 trailblazing examples due to go on display at a new exhibition in London. Over the past decade, according to curator Priya Khanchandani, the sari has seen the most rapid transformation in its 5,000-year history. From sari styles worn by young women on their way to work in Delhi and Mumbai to the spectacular creation that was the first sari to grace New Yorks famous Met Gala, the London showcase spotlights the garments 21st century revival. Khanchandani says she first became aware of a renaissance in 2015 when she met some of the designers in Delhi who were transforming the sari, traditionally a single long piece of unstitched fabric draped over the body. I saw the sari being revived as an everyday garment in a way that was very fashionable. They were being worn by younger women than I knew before, she told AFP ahead of the show, The Offbeat Sari, which opens at the Design Museum on Friday. They were often quite intellectual women, writers and artists... wearing them in ways that I didnt expect, she said. Having previously viewed saris as a garment to be worn for special events or weddings, she suddenly noticed them being reinvented as everyday clothing, even teamed with T-shirts and sneakers. The birth of mass consumerism and social media in India combined with the growth of the countrys urban middle class has accelerated the saris revamp, Khanchandani said. The influence of digital media which has a really significant reach in India, particularly among young people, allowed trends to spread and I think allowed the way that saris were being worn to become a grassroots movement, she added. Pushing boundaries Popular hashtags that have seen a vast array of images shared online include sarilove, sarifashion, designsarees and sareeindia. Despite the saris long history, it was not until last year that a sari was seen at the celebrated annual Met Gala event in New York. Worn by Indian businesswoman and socialite Natasha Poonawalla, the showstopping ensemble featured a flowing gold sari by Sabyasachi with a gold Schiaparelli bustier. In addition to extravagant couture saris, designers in India have also pushed boundaries by experimenting in a range of ways. The Raj Kilt, by the Little Shilpa brand, is described as half kilt, half sari and reflects the cross-cultural experiences of Indian designer Shilpa Chavan who studied in Britain. Some of the most eye-catching and innovative exhibits include a sari adorned with sequins cut from old X-ray images from hospital waste and another in distressed denim. But while the saris potential for extravagance and creativity is on full display in the exhibitions selections, there are also examples of how it is being pressed into use to express ideas of identity and resistance. Hundreds of thousands of members of the so-called Gulabi Gang, a group set up to fight domestic violence, including sexual abuse and child marriage in rural India, have adopted bright pink saris along with bamboo sticks as the symbol of their movement. Also included in the show is a purple silk sari embroidered with sequins and crystals by the brand Papa Dont Preach. After the label posted a photograph of the sari being worn by the author and comedian ALOK, who founded the DeGenderFashion movement, it decided to remove the womenswear wording from their messaging.",

        "content": "Four Colombian children have been found alive in the Amazon more than two weeks after the plane they were in crashed into the dense jungle. On 1 May, a Cessna 206 plane carrying seven people on a route between Araracuara in Amazonas province and San Jose del Guaviare, a city in Guaviare province, issued a May Day alert due to engine failure, reported Reuters. Three adults, including the pilot, died in the crash and their bodies were found inside the plane. The four children, aged 13, nine and four, as well as an 11-month-old baby, survived the impact. On Wednesday, president Gustavo Petro said in a statement on Twitter that the children had been found. The children were rescued by members of the military, firefighters and civil aviation authority officials in the dense jungle of Colombias Caqueta province. After arduous searching by our military, we have found alive the four children who went missing after a plane crash in Guaviare. A joy for the country, Mr Petro said. Civil aviation authorities, which coordinated the rescue efforts, believe the children escaped the plane after the crash and set off into the rainforest to find help. Rescue teams, including search dogs, earlier found discarded fruit the children ate to survive and improvised shelters made with jungle vegetation. Airplanes and helicopters from both Colombias army and air force participated in the rescue operations. Authorities have not yet revealed what caused the plane crash, though the pilot had reported engine trouble before the plane disappeared from the radar, reported AFP. Earlier this week, soldiers found the bodies of the pilot and two adults on the plane. One of the deceased, identified as Ranoque Mucutuy, was the mother of the four children who are of Huitoto ethnicity. Authorities said rescue efforts included three helicopters, including one which blasted out a recorded message from the childrens grandmother in the Huitoto language telling them to stop moving through the jungle.

        "content": "A Fundamental Rights petition has been filed requesting the Supreme Court to order the Inspector General of Police (IGP) to arrest Pastor Jerome Fernando and to take legal action against him for allegedly making remarks demeaning other religions. The FR petition has been presented by a group including Venerable Elle Gunawansa Thero and several others. The petition was presented to the Supreme Court seeking the issuing of an order to the IGP and the respondents to arrest Pastor Jerome Fernando for making a statement that is offensive to religions and to enforce the law against him. Police had yesterday clarified that Pastor Jerome Fernando, who is currently in Singapore, can be arrested upon his return to Sri Lanka owing to the overseas travel ban issued against him. In an Instagram post, Fernando had indicated that he would be returning to the island within the week, in order to host a service on Sunday titled Mega Church Day. An overseas travel ban was imposed against the Pastor on orders of the Colombo Fort Magistrates Court on Tuesday (16 May), as per a request made by the Criminal Investigation Department (CID). Fernando, however, had left the island on 14 May after making several controversial remarks regarding religions including Buddhism, Islam and Hinduism, during a recent sermon of his. A video of the sermon in question was recently widely circulated on social media, stirring much controversy within the country due to allegations that it included derogatory statements related to Lord Buddha and other religious figures. On 15 May, President Ranil Wickremesinghe ordered the CID to launch an immediate investigation into the matter, citing that such statements could create religious conflicts and harm the countrys harmony. The New Buddhist Front (Nawa Bikshu Peramuna) and the Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) had also lodged a complaint with the CID, seeking the immediate arrest of the Pastor and that strict legal action be initiated against him.",

        "date": "May 18, 2023 05:03 pm",
        "content": "Weight gain is a common complaint of holidaymakers. According to Nasa choosing a different destination could make a difference in how much you weigh. Scientists have recently discovered the reason why travellers to Sri Lanka are lighter, whereas youll gain weight in Turkey. Its not the baklava. Since the 1960s Nasa has known that gravity does not affect the globe evenly, with anomalies in the weight of objects travelling from one location to another. Though those hoping to shed might be disappointed. A traveller weighing 68kg in New Zealand could lose up to 3g when in the Maldives or Canadas Hudson Bay, where there are areas of lower relative-gravity. The difference is not massive, around 125,000 of your bodyweight, but its a start. What it does tell us is that the makeup of the planet is very different under foot, affecting the weight and gravitational force on the surface. Which country has lowest gravity? Satellites from Nasas GRACE mission (Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment) have been mapping the differences for years. While ocean measuring stations have suggested there is a difference the use of satellite imaging to measure water density has allowed Nasa to build high definition of gravity. The lowest gravity on the planet is found at the southern tip of Sri Lanka and parts of the Indian Ocean east of the Maldives. North Canada around the Hudson Bay area is also an area of low gravity. The difference is thought to be down to the thickness of the Earths crust and the volume of molten rock and magma, beneath the surface. The Canadian anomaly has been known for a long time, said Dan Britt, director of the Center for Lunar and Asteroid Surface Science. He described it like squishing a jam sandwich, the thick ice sheets deformed the crust, pushing the fluid to the edges. A couple of miles of ice is heavy enough to depress the crust, said Britt. Where on Earth is gravity the strongest? Elsewhere heavy spots can be explained by currents in molten rock, or magma, and convection currents in superheated bubbling lava. The strongest gravity earth is located around Bolivia and the northern Andes, where relative gravity represents around 50 additional milligals. Here youll be around 119613th heavier than at 1 standard gravity. Objects are also slightly heavier around the poles and around the fault lines of the Pacific. There is an area of increased weight at the top of New Zealands North Island following the Kermadec Trench. The distribution of gravity is slowly changing as the fluid magma redistributes and continental plates shift. Since the launch of the GRACE and GRACE-FO (follow on) satellites in 2018, Nasa has been mapping the slow change, by measuring surface water. Measuring the amount of water in large lakes and rivers, as well as changes in sea level and ocean currents provides an integrated global view of how Earths water cycle and energy balance are evolving, says the Nasa GRACE mission. Rather than helping weight watchers plan their holidays, there are bigger implications of gravitational anomalies on surface water which compound climate changes. GRACE allows hydrologists to monitor water in underground aquifers and entire river basins, providing better information for decisions about drought mitigation and flood hazards, says the missions Gravity Model from the University of Texas. Sadly youll gain that weight back the moment you get home. Source - nzherald -Agencies",
