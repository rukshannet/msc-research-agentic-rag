        "title": "HRCSL lists six recommendations to President on issues in the North",
        "date": "March 1, 2023 01:45 pm",
        "content": "The Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka (HRCSL) has sent a list of recommendations to President Ranil Wickremesinghe, based on their recent visit to the Northern Province. Accordingly, six recommendations were proposed to the Head of State, concerning various issues including those related to long-term prisoners. Pertaining to the long-term detainment of persons in the North, HRCSL recommended that the required measures be taken by the advisory board constituted under the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA) , and that the Ministry in charge also propose a more suitable solution. They also urged that the Parole Board recommend pardons or nolle prosequi (the termination of legal proceedings) whenever such measures are deemed appropriate, based on the crime committed and the behavior of the accused. Meanwhile, HRCSL also recommended that a Truth and Reconciliation Committee be appointed with members of competency and integrity , and with the participation of the representatives of victims. They further urged that the committee be given the power to act independently without any political interference or biases. It was also suggested that the border control by the Sri Lanka Navy be further strengthened along the coasts islandwide, in attempts to control the drug smuggling problem. Permanent barriers and checkpoints are necessary for the North for the protection of civilians from habitual offenders and for national security and public order, the HRCSL said, addressing their main concern  the disparity between the North and South on the security issue. The Commission also shed light on the harassment faced by the people of the North at military checkpoints , including body searches on women and forcing passengers to alight from buses andor unload goods from their lorries. Thus, they recommended that the government instruct the respective forces to adopt alternative methods with immediate effect. They also raised concerns that the identification pass system implemented for fishermen from Mannar is a violation of their fundamental rights, as it is discriminatory and is not in operation in any other part of the island. Accordingly, the Commission is due to make recommendations pertaining to this issue following discussion with the fishermen, their representatives and relevant State authorities. The Commission, however, made no efforts to address the land issues of the people of the North, despite this being a grave concern, on account of the fact that President Wickremesinghe has already taken the necessary measures to resolve the matter.",

        "title": "Pakistans top court orders polls to go ahead as planned",
        "date": "March 1, 2023 02:19 pm",
        "content": "Pakistans powerful Supreme Court on Wednesday ordered imminent general elections to go ahead as planned in a bid to quash fears a fledgling democratic process is about to be derailed. The order came amid speculation that the military is working with the judiciary to force out a civilian leader and delay the elections that will mark the first time a civilian government in Pakistan has completed a full term since independence in 1947. The executive, both civilian and military, shall not take any action or steps that are tantamount to deviation from the election, Chief Justice Iftikhar Chaudhry ruled. Deviation from the constitution or introducing any other system not recognised by the constitution shall not be acceptable. The general election is expected in May. This month, a firebrand cleric, Tahirul Qadri, camped outside parliament with thousands of supporters calling on the government to step down. The timing of Qadris return from six years in Canada, just a few months before elections are due, and his role in supporting a 1999 coup by former army chief Pervez Musharraf, had raised fears that the army was using him to bring down the government and provide a pretext to hand-pick a caretaker cabinet. Under Chaudhry, the Supreme Court, which has final say on interpreting the constitution, has been embroiled in a long-running showdown with the government that has laid bare institutional tension plaguing a country that has developed nuclear weapons but has yet to agree on how it should be run. The military, which has ruled Pakistan for about half of its 66 years as an independent nation, has not hidden its disdain for the government of President Asif Ali Zardari, but has said it does not wish to seize power this time round. The judges eagerness to rewrite the rules of Pakistans power game have won it support among those who see the judiciary as the only realistic hope of holding their leaders to account.

Speaking at a party rally held in Polonnaruwa, the JVP leader stated that it is clear that although a decision pertaining to the date on which the 2023 LG polls will be held will be announced this month, the polls will likely be held only in May 2023. Dissanayake further attributed the delay in elections to the apparent fear of the President of the fact that the people of the country have already chosen the political party they want elected. The public of our country have already chosen their political party, and are now protesting on behalf of it. This is why elections are being postponed. However, the more this election is postponed, the stronger the NPP will get, Dissanayake said. Accordingly, he assured that the change the people will want will come into force within a year, explaining that even if they postpone this election, they can only play these games for a year.",

        "content": "The Colombo District Court has ordered that President Ranil Wickremesinghe be released from the 108 cases filed by the victims of the 2019 Easter Sunday attacks. The order was issued by Colombo District Judge Mahesha de Silva when the case was taken up in court this morning (01 March). During a previous hearing of the case, Wickremesinghes lawyers argued that although their client was named as a respondent in these cases, it was not possible to maintain the charges levelled against him, as per Article 35 of the Constitution, on account of the fact that he is currently serving as the Executive President of Sri Lanka. A total of 108 cases were filed before the Colombo District Court against a group of individuals including former President Maithripala Sirisena and then Premier Ranil Wickremesinghe. On 12 January, the Supreme Court found the former President, along with former Defence Secretary Hemasiri Fernando, former IGP Pujith Jayasundara, former National Intelligence Chief Sisira Mendis and former Chief of State Intelligence Nilantha Jayawardena in violation of the Fundamental Rights of petitioners, by failing to take action to prevent the Easter Sunday attacks despite receiving sufficient intelligence information.",

        "date": "March 1, 2023 03:49 pm",
        "content": "FIFAs choice of Brazilian supermodel Adriana Lima as its first global fan ambassador five months before the Womens World Cup was described Tuesday as tone deaf by the former leader of the soccer bodys task force for womens soccer. Limas appointment to develop, promote and participate in several global initiatives was announced by FIFA on Monday hours before the former Victorias Secret runway model helped present the fan prize in Paris at its annual award ceremony. Seriously, FIFA, is this the fan engagement ambassador we need as the (Womens World Cup) approaches? wrote Moya Dodd, who was part of the co-hosting bid campaign for her native Australia and New Zealand, on her Twitter account. Dodd, a former FIFA executive committee member and longtime advocate for womens soccer, used the hashtag tonedeaf and posted the glamor photo from the profile of Limas Twitter account that has 2.4 million followers. A former Australia national-team player, Dodd also recalled recent speculation FIFA could sign the Saudi Arabia tourism board as an official sponsor of the month-long tournament that starts July 20. Honestly baffled by the marketing strategy. First FIFA wants to send an LGBTQ-friendly audience to Visit Saudi, Dodd wrote. Now its targeting who exactly? Lima was photographed Monday in Paris at the FIFA gala event with its president Gianni Infantino and posted on Twitter her new role means the world to me. She also posted to her 15.4 million followers on Instagram: It is a great honor to be part of the FIFA Family. As a fan myself, I hope to connect at a greater level this family to the life of this beautiful sport: the fans! she wrote. FIFA did not specify details Monday of the projects involving Lima, nor if it would involve the biggest-ever marquee womens tournament which now has 32 teams. When you get to meet Adriana, you feel right away her warmth, kindness, and how approachable and passionate she is about our game, Infantino said Monday in the FIFA statement. She lives and breathes futebol and that is also why she can be an excellent link between FIFA and fans worldwide, he said. FIFA noted Lima is a supermodel, actress and businesswoman but offered no details about her links to the sport besides being a fan. Lima posted her condolences after Pelés death in December. Infantino and Dodd served together on FIFAs ruling committee for more than a year after he was elected in 2016. She was the first woman, in 2013, to represent the Asian soccer confederation at FIFA and gained a reputation as an independent voice during the presidency of Sepp Blatter. Dodd lost her re-election bid four years later to an opponent from Bangladesh. Her latest criticism of FIFA follows an op-ed article she wrote for an Australian newspaper four weeks ago. She suggested that FIFA asking LGBTQ players and fans to visit Saudi Arabia was to send them to a jurisdiction where they are regarded as criminals. Dodd also wrote then she was thrilled by the progress womens football has made there (in Saudi Arabia) in recent times. The pending Visit Saudi sponsor deal also provoked the soccer federations of Australia and New Zealand to urge FIFA not to sign the agreement. Source - ABC News -Agencies",

        "content": "China says it will continue to support relevant countries and international financial institutions to jointly play a positive role in helping Sri Lanka navigate the situation, ease its debt burden and achieve sustainable development. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning made this remark in response to a question raised during a regular press conference held on Tuesday (Feb 28) whether China is willing to make any adjustment to fall in line with the assurances required to finalize Sri Lankas IMF bailout package or if there are other steps that have been taken to overcome Chinese concerns on the islands recast and the overall debt restructuring landscape. Speaking further, the spokesperson reiterated that the Export-Import Bank of China has provided a financing support document to the Ministry of Finance, Economic Stabilization  National Policies of Sri Lanka, reassuring that the Bank plans to provide an extension on the debt service due in 2022 and 2023 to help relieve the islands short-term debt repayment pressure. The Bank also noted that it will support Sri Lanka in its loan application to the IMF and continuously call on commercial creditors (including the International Sovereign Bondholders) to provide debt treatment in an equally comparable manner, and encourage multilateral creditors to do their utmost to make corresponding contributions. Mao said what China did first is based on its existing policy and position on debt issues. At the same time, as a special arrangement, it also reflects the traditional friendship between China and Sri Lanka. She underscored that Chinas action fully demonstrates its sincerity and efforts to support Sri Lanka in achieving debt sustainability. China will continue to support relevant financial institutions in actively working out the debt treatment. We will work with relevant countries and international financial institutions to jointly play a positive role in helping Sri Lanka navigate the situation, ease its debt burden and achieve sustainable development.",

        "date": "March 1, 2023 09:18 pm",
        "content": "Rescuers delved Wednesday through flattened, burned-out carriages for survivors and bodies after a passenger train and a freight train crashed head-on in central Greece overnight, killing at least 36 people and injuring scores. Transport Minister Kostas Karamanlis resigned Wednesday, saying he felt it was his duty to step down as a basic indication of respect for the memory of the people who died so unfairly. The cause of the crash near the Vale of Tempe, about 380 kilometers (235 miles) north of Athens, was not immediately clear, but the stationmaster in the nearby city of Larissa was arrested Wednesday. The police did not release his name. Another two people have been detained for questioning. Its unclear at what speed the two trains were travelling when they ran into each other just before midnight Tuesday, but state broadcaster ERT said it was more than 140 kilometers per hour (87 miles per hour). Survivors said the impact threw several passengers through the windows of train cars. ERT quoted rescuers saying they found some victims bodies 30-40 meters (100-130 feet) from the impact site. Stefanos Gogakos said it felt like an explosion, while from his rear carriage flames could be seen at the front of the train. The glass in the windows shattered and fell on top of us, he told ERT. My head hit the roof of the carriage with the jolt. Some people started to climb out through the windows because there was smoke in the carriage. The doors were closed but in a few minutes train staff opened them and we got out. Multiple cars derailed and at least three burst into flames. On Wednesday, one carriage lay atop the crumpled remains of another two. Temperatures reached 1,300 degrees Celsius (2,372 Fahrenheit), which makes it even more difficult to identify the people who were in it, fire service spokesperson Vassilis Varthakoyiannis said. Many of the 350 people aboard the passenger train were students returning from Greeces raucous Carnival, officials said. This year was the first time the three-day festival, which precedes Lent, was celebrated in full since the start of the pandemic in 2020. Visiting the accident scene, Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said that the government must help the injured recover and identify the dead. I can guarantee one thing: We will find out the causes of this tragedy and we will do all thats in our power so that something like this never happens again, Mitsotakis said. Greek President Katerina Sakellaropoulou broke off an official visit to Moldova to visit the scene, laying flowers beside the wreckage. The government declared three days of national mourning from Wednesday, while flags flew at half-staff outside all European Commission buildings in Brussels. Pope Francis offered his condolences to the families of the dead, in a message sent to the president of the Greek bishops conference on his behalf by the Vaticans secretary of state, The pontiff sends the assurance of his prayers to everyone affected by this tragedy, the message said. On Wednesday, rescuers turned to cranes and other heavy machinery to start moving large pieces of the trains, revealing more bodies and dismembered remains. Officials said the army had been contacted to assist. Rescuer Lazaros Sarianidis told state broadcaster ERT that crews were very carefully trying to disentangle steel, sheet metal and other material that was twisted together by the crash. It will take a long time, said Sarianidis. Costas Agorastos, the regional governor of the Thessaly area, told Greeces Skai Television that the two trains collided head on at high speed. Carriage one and two no longer exist, and the third has derailed, he said. The trains crashed just before the Vale of Tempe, a gorge that separates the regions of Thessaly and Macedonia. There were many big pieces of steel, said Vassilis Polyzos, a local resident who said he was one of the first people on the scene. The trains were completely destroyed, both passenger and freight trains. He said dazed and disoriented people were escaping out of the trains rear cars as he arrived. People, naturally, were scared  very scared, he said. They were looking around, searching; they didnt know where they were. Eight rail employees were among those killed in the crash, including the two drivers of the freight train and the two drivers of the passenger train, according to Greek Railroad Workers Union President Yannis Nitsas. Greeces firefighting service said some 66 people were hospitalized, including six in intensive care. More than 200 people who were unharmed in the crash or suffered minor injuries were transported by bus to Thessaloniki, 130 kilometers (80 miles) to the north. Police took their names as they arrived, in an effort to track anyone who may be missing. Barely able to hold back tears, Greeces Transport Minister Kostas Karamanlis told reporters at the crash site that authorities would investigate in all seriousness and complete transparency the causes of the crash. We will do everything to investigate the causes and wont leave anything to be swept under the carpet, Karamanlis said. A teenage survivor who did not give his name to reporters said that just before the crash he felt a strong braking and saw sparks  then there was a sudden stop. Our carriage didnt derail, but the ones in front did and were smashed, he said, visibly shaken. He added that the first car caught fire and that he used a bag to break the window of his car, the fourth, and escape. Rail operator Hellenic Train said the northbound passenger train to Thessaloniki, Greeces second-largest city, had about 350 passengers on board. Hellenic Train is operated by Italys FS Group, which runs rail services in several European countries. Source  The Associated Press -Agencies",

        "content": "A decision has been taken during a special Cabinet meeting held today (March 01) to permit state institutions, ministries, departments and statuary boards to open accounts at private banks, if trade union actions are hindering the opening of letters of credit to import medicines and other essential goods, says the Cabinet Spokesperson, Minister Bandula Gunawardene. During the meeting, the ministers have pointed out to the President that as a result of the state bank staff resorting to trade union actions, the continuation of public services may become problematic. They have also highlighted that it will affect the lives of the people, if a situation emerges, where it is not possible to issue letters of credit on time, especially for the most essential services such as purchasing fuel, gas and medicines. Accordingly, drawing attention towards this situation, the Cabinet of Ministers has proposed to permit public institutions to open and maintain accounts at private banks to be useful in case of an emergency. Thus, the President has instructed to grant approval for the matter with prior approval of the Ministry of Finance, Minister Bandula Gunawardena said.",

        "content": "The Supreme Court of India recently directed the Tamil Nadu government to reconsider the issue of premature release of a Sri Lankan convict, who has undergone nearly 35 years of incarceration within three weeks. Considering earlier orders, a bench of Justices AS Oka and Rajesh Bindal noted that the petitioner intended to go back to Sri Lanka pursuant to his release. The court further directed for shifting him to appropriate transit camp to be decided by the State Government. It is not the case of the State Government or the Union of India that there are any other offences committed by the petitioner. Therefore, considering the overall factual scenario and nationality of the petitioner, the case of the petitioner for pre-mature release will have to be reconsidered by the State Government in the light of the policy dated February 1, 2018 or any other relevant policy which is applicable to the petitioner. We direct the Tamil Nadu government to reconsider the issue of pre-mature release of the petitioner in the light of what is observed in this order within a maximum period of three weeks from today, the court said in its order. The courts order came in a plea which was filed by one Rajan who was convicted to suffer life imprisonment. It was stated in his plea that his pre mature release was earlier considered by the state in terms of Policy dated 1st February, 2018 but was rejected on the ground of seriousness of the crime committed and the effect on the trial due to his release. Apprising the bench of states decision of setting up transit camps, Tamil Nadu Govt had submitted that he can be shifted to an appropriate transit camp in case the court directs the same.

According to the 2021 survey, this amount has increased to 30. Also, 34 of women fell into the category of overweight and obese in 2015.

Frogmore Cottage, on the grounds of Windsor Castle west of London, had been intended as the couples main residence before they gave up royal duties and moved to Southern California. The Sun newspaper reported that Charles started the eviction process on Jan. 11, the day after the publication of Harrys explosive memoir Spare. We can confirm The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have been requested to vacate their residence at Frogmore Cottage, a spokesperson for the couple said in statement. Disclosures Harry made in Spare deepened the rift between him and his family. The book included his account of private conversations with his father, and his brother, Prince William. After they left Britain, Harry and Meghan had said Frogmore Cottage would remain their base when they visited the U.K. In September 2020, a spokesman announced the couple had repaid 2.4 million pounds (3.2 million) in British taxpayers money that was used to renovate the home when they were working members of the royal family.

        "date": "March 2, 2023 11:27 am",
        "content": "The U.S. House Foreign Affairs Committee voted on Wednesday along party lines to give President Joe Biden the power to ban Chinese-owned TikTok, in what would be the most far-reaching U.S. restriction on any social media app. Lawmakers voted 24 to 16 to approve the measure to grant the administration new powers to ban the ByteDance-owned app - which is used by over 100 million Americans - as well as other apps considered security risks. TikTok is a national security threat ... It is time to act, said Representative Michael McCaul, the Republican chair of the committee who sponsored the bill. Anyone with TikTok downloaded on their device has given the CCP (Communist Party of China) a backdoor to all their personal information. Its a spy balloon into their phone. Democrats opposed the bill, saying it was rushed and required due diligence through debate and consultation with experts. The bill does not precisely specify how the ban would work, but gives Biden power to ban any transactions with TikTok, which in turn could prevent anyone in the United States from accessing or downloading the app on their phones. The bill would also require Biden to impose a ban on any entity that may transfer sensitive personal data to an entity subject to the influence of China. TikTok has come under increasing fire in recent weeks over fears that user data could end up in the hands of the Chinese government, undermining Western security interests. The White House this week gave government agencies 30 days to ensure that TikTok is not on any federal devices and systems. More than 30 U.S. states, Canada and European Union policy institutions have also banned TikTok from being loaded onto state-owned devices. The fate of the latest measure is still uncertain and faces significant hurdles before it can become law. The bill would need to be passed by the full House and U.S. Senate, which is controlled by Democrats, before it can go to Biden. A U.S. ban on TikTok is a ban on the export of American culture and values to the billion people who use our service worldwide, a TikTok spokeswoman said after the vote. The Biden administration did not say whether it was in favor of moving ahead with the bill or not, or answer if it believed Biden has the legal authority now to ban TikTok. White House spokesperson Karine Jean-Pierre said TikTok poses a problem and an issue - and so we have concerns about that as it relates to Americans data. INSTINCT TO BAN Representative Gregory Meeks, the top Democrat on the committee, said he strongly opposed the legislation but understands concerns about TikTok. The Republican instinct to ban things it fears, from books to speech, appears uninhibited, Meeks said, adding the bill would require the administration to sanction TikTok and other subsidiaries of TikToks parent company. The U.S. governments Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), a powerful national security body, in 2020 unanimously recommended ByteDance divest TikTok because of fears that user data could be passed on to Chinas government. TikTok and CFIUS have been negotiating for more than two years on data security requirements. TikTok said it has spent more than 1.5 billion on rigorous data security efforts and rejects spying allegations. Meeks wants the talks to continue. Meeks said the bill is dangerously broad and would require U.S. sanctions on Korean and Taiwanese companies that supply Chinese companies with semiconductor chips and other equipment because of its broad restrictions on data transfers to China. The American Civil Liberties Union called on lawmakers to oppose the bill, calling it a serious violation of our First Amendment rights. McCaul told Reuters after the vote that he expects the bill would be voted on by the House this month. TikTok Chief Executive Shou Zi Chew is due to appear before the U.S. Energy and Commerce Committee on March 23 after meeting with lawmakers last month on Capitol Hill. Source - Reuters -Agencies",

        "date": "March 2, 2023 12:01 pm",
        "content": "Borrowing costs hovering at two-decade highs to quell Asias fastest inflation rates will be in focus in Pakistan and Sri Lanka, as the crisis-gripped economies review monetary policy settings in decisions seen as key to winning multilateral bailout funds. The two monetary authorities are likely to take different tracks as price pressures have somewhat eased in Sri Lanka after peaking at nearly 70, while still on the boil in Pakistan where the central bank advanced the meeting by two weeks to March 2. State Bank of Pakistan will on Thursday probably increase the target rate by 200 basis points to 19, according to 28 of 38 economists surveyed by Bloomberg, with the rest expecting even higher increases ranging from 250- to 300-basis points. SBP doesnt provide a set time for the announcement. On Friday, the Central Bank of Sri Lanka will probably keep the standing lending facility rate at 15.5 for a fifth straight meeting, according to all eight economists in a Bloomberg survey ahead of the decision at 4:30 p.m. in Colombo. The nations benchmark rate is at the highest since 2001, according to central bank data. The International Monetary Funds bailout  2.9 billion for Sri Lanka and 6.5 billion for Pakistan  if approved will unlock more funding, boost foreign-currency reserves that right now can pay for less than a month of imports, and arrest a deepening turmoil. But the loans have strings attached, such as ensuring sustainable revenue and enabling market-determined exchange rates that have led to a spate of energy price increases, tax hikes and depreciation in currencies  all of which tend to spur inflation. Consumer prices in Colombo cooled to 50.6 in February from a year earlier. In Pakistan, price gains quickened to 31.55, the most since the 1960s, according to central bank data. Both Pakistan and Sri Lanka are well behind the inflation curve, according to Hasnain Malik, a strategist at Tellimer in Dubai. More rate increases and more fiscal cuts are ahead, which means further pain for the economy is in store. Bailout programs of the two countries have been pending for months, and in the case of Pakistan, for years. Pakistan secured a 1.1 billion IMF loan in August, which was part of a 6.5 billion package approved in 2019. Disagreements over spending plans after last years devastating floods and governments failure to meet loan conditions stalled the program. Reviving the bailout became crucial as the nation teetered on the brink of a default. What Bloomberg Economics Says Pakistan is at serious risk of default. The International Monetary Fund has been dragging its feet on aid for months. And even if the IMF finally comes through, the debt wont be sustainable unless creditors agree to large write-downs. China, Pakistans largest external lender, might have to accept a haircut of as much as 8 billion, by our calculations. That is high unlikely  and shows just how dire the situation is. An IMF review last month ended without a deal for Pakistan. The government on Tuesday insisted that IMFs loan review is progressing well and a staff-level agreement can be clinched in the next few days. In the case of Sri Lanka, an IMF staff-level pact for a 2.9 billion loan program was secured at the start of September, with the board originally anticipated to approve the funds by the end of 2022. Authorities have since adjusted expectations to within this quarter. The main reason for the delay is the absence of a formal assurance from China, also Sri Lankas biggest bilateral creditor, that it would support a debt restructuring for the bankrupt island nation. While crippling supply shortages in Sri Lanka have eased, foreign currency reserves have been inching up and inflation slowing, Sri Lanka needs the IMF bailout to get more funding and turn the corner. Just getting into a program is not enough, said Dhananath Fernando, the head of a Colombo-based economic think tank Advocata Institute. Sri Lanka can also fall back like Pakistan. It has to bring long term stability and do the reforms. Source - Bloomberg -Agencies",

        "title": "Half of families reducing childrens food intake as Sri Lanka slips further into hunger crisis  survey",
        "date": "March 2, 2023 06:31 pm",
        "content": "Half of families in Sri Lanka are forced to reduce the amount they feed their children, according to a survey by Save the Children, as the countrys economic downturn spirals further into a full-blown hunger crisis nearly a year after the government defaulted on its debt. The government and international community must act now to prevent the countrys children from becoming a lost generation, the child rights organisation said. Since the Sri Lankan government defaulted on its debt nearly a year ago, soaring inflation and food, medicine and fuel shortages as well as a lack of stable employment have left families unable to cope. The country has the seventh highest nominal food inflation rate in the world, according to the World Bank, with year-on-year inflation in the country more than 50. Save the Childrens latest survey of 2,308 households across nine districts in Sri Lanka found that due to this inflation, average household expenditure increased by 18 between June and December last year. During this time there was a 23 increase in households unable to meet most or all of their general basic needs, Save the Children said. Because of this, over the past six months, more families have had to resort to desperate measures to survive, with a 24 increase in households saying they had resorted to borrowing money in order to cover household expenses; a 24 increase in households saying they had to purchase food on credit; and a 28 increase in households selling household items for cash. Female-headed households are particularly vulnerable, Save the Children said, as women are increasingly at risk of trafficking or exploitation, working overtime and in some cases migrating for work. This in turn puts children at risk as they are left alone, according to the child rights organisation. While half of households said they are cutting their childrens food intake, 27 reported adults skipping meals to feed their children. Nine out of ten households said they cannot guarantee nutritious food for their children. Suren and Preethika, from Colombo, struggle to provide a well-balanced meal for all three of their children. Even simple nutritional foods, such as eggs and yoghurt, have become too expensive for the family to afford, limiting the items they are able to feed their children. On most days, they are forced to prioritize their toddlers nutrition. Their 11-year-old daughter Thisuri said that she and her 8-year-old sister Ayama now often go without things like yoghurt because their parents can only afford to provide it for their one-year-old sister, Hiruni. Thisuri said: We really like to eat yoghurt too, but most of the time my parents can only afford to buy yoghurt for my youngest sister. Whenever they have extra and can afford it, they buy the two of us yoghurt too. Things are so expensive in shops now. It was never like this before. The survey also found that 70 of households lost all or most of their sources of income between June and December last year. Among these, more than half of households (54) now source their main household income from jobs that are seasonal and irregular. This instability is putting children in the precarious position of not knowing where their next meal is coming from, Save the Children said. Julian Chellappah, Save the Childrens Sri Lanka Country Director said: These figures show how the crisis in Sri Lanka continues to spiral out of control and how, as with any crisis, children are bearing the brunt with their physical and mental health, nutrition and education all at risk. These children were born into hope as the countrys post-war generation  but we are in grave danger of failing them once again. Parents should never have to choose who in their family gets to eat a meal. Everything we are seeing here points to a very real danger of a full-blown hunger crisis. The Sri Lankan government is giving much-needed support to some families through welfare schemes, but we need a rapid build-up of social protection systems with support from the international community. This is an emergency situation that requires an emergency response. All humanitarian interventions must factor in patriarchal gender dynamics of communities in order to best meet needs, Save the Children said. Source - Save The Children -Agencies",

        "date": "March 2, 2023 08:41 pm",
        "content": "U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov talked briefly Thursday at a meeting of top diplomats from the Group of 20 nations in the first high-level meeting in months between the two countries. U.S. officials said Blinken and Lavrov chatted for roughly 10 minutes on the sidelines of the G-20 conference in New Delhi. The short encounter came as relations between Washington and Moscow have plummeted while tensions over Russias war with Ukraine have soared. A senior U.S. official said Blinken used the discussion to make three points to Lavrov: that the U.S. would support Ukraine in the conflict for as long as it takes to bring the war to an end, that Russia should reverse its decision to suspend participation in the New START nuclear treaty and that Moscow should release detained American Paul Whelan. The official, who spoke to reporters on the condition of anonymity to discuss the private conversation, said Blinken had disabused Lavrov of any idea they might have that U.S. support for Ukraine is wavering. The official declined to characterize Lavrovs response but said Blinken did not get the impression that there would be any change in Russias behavior in the near term. Lavrov, who did not mention speaking with Blinken, told reporters that Moscow will continue to press its action in Ukraine. He shrugged off Western claims of Russias isolation, saying we arent feeling isolated. Its the West that has isolated itself, and it will eventually come to realize it. He said Russia remains open to talks on ending the conflict in Ukraine, but he accused the West of effectively blocking such talks. They are calling on us to have talks, but I dont remember any Western colleagues calling on Ukraine to have talks, he said. They are encouraging Ukraine to continue the war. Lavrov also mocked the U.S. threats against China. Our Western colleagues have lost self-control, forgotten their manners and put diplomacy aside, switching exclusively to blackmail and threats. he said. Russia had no immediate comment on the substance of the conversation, but Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova said Blinken had asked to speak to Lavrov. It was their first contact since last summer, when Blinken talked to Lavrov by phone about a U.S. proposal for Russia to release Whelan and formerly detained WNBA star Brittney Griner. Griner was later released in a swap for imprisoned Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout, but Whelan remains detained in Russia. Whelan, a Michigan corporate security executive, has been held for four years on espionage charges that his family and the United States government have said are baseless. The last time Blinken and Lavrov met in person was in Geneva, Switzerland, in January 2022 on the eve of Russias invasion. At that meeting, Blinken warned Lavrov about consequences Russia would face if it went ahead with its planned military operation but also sought to address some complaints that Russian President Vladimir Putin had made about the U.S. and NATO. Those talks proved to be inconclusive as Russia moved ahead with its plans to invade and Blinken then canceled a scheduled follow-up meeting with Lavrov that was set for just two days before Moscow eventually invaded on Feb. 24, 2022. The two men have attended several international conferences together since the war began, notably the last G-20 foreign ministers meeting in Bali, Indonesia, last year, but they had not come face to face until Thursday.

        "content": "World Bank Vice President for South Asia, Martin Raiser has reaffirmed the World Banks continued support to help navigate Sri Lankas navigate economic challenges, implement critical reforms, and chart a path towards a resilient and inclusive recovery. During his four-day visit to the island nation, which concluded on 28 February, Raiser met with President and Minister of Finance Ranil Wickremesinghe, Secretary of the Treasury, Governor of the Central Bank, senior government officials, development partners, and key opinion leaders including members of Sri Lankas political opposition, thinks tanks, civil society organizations and academia. The people of Sri Lanka have been deeply affected by the macro and debt crisis affecting the country. The depth of the crisis has made it clear that Sri Lanka needs a new development model, but this requires greater confidence in and understanding of the governments reforms, said Martin Raiser. Improved communication and consistent implementation of the reform and adjustment program is urgent, as is faster international debt relief and financial support to ensure people dont lose patience and the opportunity for a change isnt lost. During the visit, Raiser discussed progress on reforms to transform economic governance in Sri Lanka through strengthened institutional and fiscal oversight and better debt management. He also stressed that greater transparency, improved governance, support for job creation, as well as better targeted protection for the poorest are critical to garner and sustain public support for reforms. Raiser also visited North Central and Northwestern Provinces to observe first-hand World Bank-funded projects in the health and agriculture sectors, and to engage with a broad range of stakeholders on Sri Lankas development needs. The World Bank was among the first to respond to Sri Lankas economic crisis, with the Banks emergency response having repurposed 325 million from existing projects to protect the poor and vulnerable from the worst impacts of the crisis. In December, the Bank approved Sri Lankas request to access concessional financing from the International Development Association (IDA). This type of financing, offered at low interest rates, will enable the country to implement its government-led reform program to stabilize the economy and protect the livelihoods of millions of people facing poverty and hunger, a statement issued by the World Bank read. The World Bank Group has started preparing a new Country Partnership Framework for the next four years (2023-2026) with a focus on private sector led job creation, inclusion, preservation and strengthening of human and natural capital, improved governance, and a shift towards a greener growth path.",

Nobody was injured in the early morning attack, and it was unclear why assailants would target the Argentina star or the supermarket, which is owned by the family of his wife, Antonella Roccuzzo. Police said two men on a motorcycle fired at least a dozen shots into the supermarket in the early hours, and left a message on a piece of cardboard that read, Messi, were waiting for you. Rosario mayor Pablo Javkin is also a drug trafficker, so he wont take care of you. Messi, who captained Argentina to victory at last years World Cup, has not commented on the incident. Messi plays for Paris Saint-Germain and spends much of his time overseas, though he often visits Rosario where he has a home in the suburb of Funes. In Rosario, prosecutor Federico Rébola said authorities were reviewing security camera footage and that the investigation was preliminary. It was the first time Messis in-laws had received this kind of threat, he added. Celia Arena, justice minister for Santa Fe province, where Rosario is located, said the attack amounted to terrorism by a mafia group meant to intimidate the broader population. Meanwhile, Javkin attacked federal authorities over what he called their failure to curb a surge in drug-related violence in Rosario, which is located about 190 miles northwest of Buenos Aires. Javkin, a center-left politician in opposition to the ruling Peronist coalition, appeared to throw suspicion of complicity for the attack on criminal gangs and federal security officials. I doubt everyone, even those who are supposed to protect us, Javkin said in an interview with a local radio station. He said the supermarket was in a section of Rosario that has seen frequent crimes, and that he has raised the issue in recent meetings with federal and provincial law enforcement officials, but no action has been taken. Where are the ones who need to take care of us? Javkin said. Its clear that those who have the weapons and have the possibility of investigating the criminals arent doing it, and its very easy for any gang to carry out something like this.

China, the worlds largest bilateral creditor, has criticised multilateral lenders for not accepting losses, or haircuts, on loans to low-income countries while Beijing is being asked to do so on credit it has extended on its own. We hope that multilateral financial institutions and commercial creditors will be actively involved in the debt treatment of developing countries, Qin said during a gathering of foreign ministers from the Group of 20 (G20) leading economies in New Delhi. The G20 set up a Common Framework in late 2020 to offer relief to low-income countries facing mounting pressures resulting from COVID-19 and tightening global financial conditions amid the Ukraine war. China has put forth relevant initiatives under the G20, Qin said. China has suspended more debt service payments than any other G20 member, and participated in the debt treatment under the Common Framework. The United States has repeatedly criticised China over what it considers to be foot-dragging on debt relief for dozens of low-and middle-income countries including Sri Lanka. Last week, China urged G20 nations to conduct a fair, objective and in-depth analysis of the causes of global debt issues and to resolve the problem in a comprehensive and effective manner.

Meanwhile, 40 Officer Cadets including three females were commissioned as Officers of the Sri Lanka Air Force by the Chief Guest, and received their ceremonial swords, which symbolizes their status as Commissioned Officers. Thereafter, flying brevets were pinned on 13 pilot officers and 07 trophies were awarded for special achievements. Two Officer Cadets who have shown exceptional performance were awarded the Sword of Eagle for the best student of General Duties Pilot Branch and the Sword of honour for the overall best student among all branches. The President also posed for a group photograph with the newly commissioned officers and senior officers. The Sri Lanka Air Force Band rendered a special performance and the parachute display adding colour to the event. Attached below is an excerpt of the speech delivered by the President at the event: In order to move forward as a united and prosperous country, all individuals regardless of their ethnicity, religion, or cultural background must work together. Whether Sinhalese, Tamil, Muslim, Burgher, Buddhist, Catholic, Hindu or Muslim, it is essential that all citizens come together to work towards the greater good of the nation. Only by working together can we build a stronger, more prosperous future for our country and its people. The legitimacy of Sri Lankas government is established by the executive, legislature, and judiciary. The judiciary plays a crucial role in upholding and enforcing the laws enacted by the legislature. All three institutions are focused on safeguarding Sri Lankas constitution and ensuring that the country functions in accordance with its laws and regulations. It is the responsibility of every citizen to help protect these institutions, which are essential to the proper functioning of the government and the preservation of Sri Lankas democracy. Without these institutions, there can be no assurance that the country will remain stable and secure. It is important to note that any changes to the government must be made through the proper channels, such as a parliamentary election. The streets are not an option for the parliament, and any attempt to subvert the established process would be a violation of Sri Lankas constitution and the rule of law. I am deeply grateful to the armed forces for their role in protecting the Parliament last June. As we have seen in other countries, when a parliament is not safeguarded, chaos and anarchy can quickly ensue. Similarly, a country without a strong economy is also at risk of devolving into chaos. It is therefore the responsibility of all of us to work together to protect both the constitution and the economy of our country. In recent days, I have met with various organizations to discuss strategies for boosting the economy, and I am confident that our efforts will yield positive results in the near future. By protecting our country and upholding its constitution, we can ensure that our democracy remains strong and vibrant.",

Four more persons, including a broker and a three-wheeler driver who had aided the abduction, were also arrested, while the infant is currently in police custody. Investigations have revealed that the main suspect responsible for the abduction had lost her child seven months into her pregnancy while staying at a relatives house in Colombo. Police added that her husband resides abroad. The lady in question had later informed an associate of hers residing in Dematagoda to find her a child, while being in possession of Rs. 300,000, with the intention of buying a child. Subsequently, the duo had offered Rs. 100,000 to a beggar in the Bambalapitiya area, in exchange for her infant son. Upon receiving the beggars consent, the payment was made, after which Rs. 50,000 was given to the broker, Rs. 25,000 was given to the three-wheeler driver, while the other two arrestees were also given Rs. 25,000 each. However, the mother of the infant had later refused to give the child, after which the infant was abducted from the beggar in a car park in the Kompagngna Veediya area (formerly known as Slave Island), and taken to the Wanathawilluwa area. The matter was investigated following a complaint lodged by the mother of the infant, after which arrests were made based on CCTV footage obtained. Police have also discovered that the mother of the infant, and her husband, are both heavy drug addicts. Accordingly, the 53-year-old female suspect, together with the other four arrestees and the mother of the infant are due to be produced before the court.",

Representatives from the Bank of Ceylon (BOC), State Bank of India and the Indian Bank shared their experiences and informed the audience that they had started carrying out INR-denominated trade transactions through respective VostroNostro accounts after the creation of enabling framework by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) in 2022. The participating banks also outlined the benefits of settlements denominated in INR which includes shorter timelines, lower exchange costs and easier availability of trade credits etc. The beneficial impact of this initiative on the tourism and hospitality industry was also highlighted including its role in helping increase collections which could be utilized by other sectors. A team from RBI joined the discussion in the online format and indicated the possibility of settlement of current account transactions in goods as well as services in INR apart from the option of undertaking permitted capital account transactions. The RBI team referred to the close cooperation with CBSL and RBIs commitment to further facilitate this process. State Minister of Finance Shehan Semasinghe appreciated the close economic relationship between the two countries and the financial and humanitarian support extended by India over the past year including the strong financing assurances provided by India in the context of the IMF support programme for Sri Lanka. Governor of CBSL, Dr. P. Nandalal Weerasinghe mentioned the strong desire among Indian and Sri Lankan business communities for enabling trade settlements in INR. He called for expanding this facility over a period of time to utilize it for the full range of capital and current account transactions.

        "date": "March 4, 2023 08:52 am",
        "content": "The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has commended the decision taken by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) to raise the policy interest rates, saying that it is appropriate and in line with its objectives. It reflects CBSLs commitment to the inflation target and is an important part of the disinflation strategy in the EFF program, which is fully committed by the Sri Lankan authorities and supported by IMF, Senior Mission Chief for Sri Lanka, Peter Breuer and Mission Chief for Sri Lanka, Masahiro Nozaki said in a joint statement. They remarked that Sri Lankas inflation is declining but remains at a very high level, which has been disproportionally hurting the poor. As upside inflation risks could reverse the trend and lead to persistently high inflation which is extremely costly to the economy, the IMF officials said the CBSLs decision to raise the policy rate shows its commitment to reduce inflation more quickly and firmly towards the single-digit target. Durable disinflation would help boost market confidence, reduce excessive risk premia and ease the financing conditions for the corporates, especially the small and medium enterprises, which supports recovery. This statement comes a day after the CBSL announced its Monetary Boards decision to raise the Standing Deposit Facility Rate (SDFR) and the Standing Lending Facility Rate (SLFR) by 100 basis points. Accordingly, the SDFR and the SLFR were moved up to 15.50 and 16.50, respectively, with effect from the close of business on Friday (March 03). The decision was taken in a bid to fulfill the prerequisites required to move forward with the finalisation of the IMF Extended Fund Facility (EFF) arrangement Sri Lanka currently awaits.

        "date": "March 4, 2023 12:46 pm",
        "content": "Nobel Peace Prize winner and human rights activist Ales Bialiatski was sentenced to 10 years in prison on Friday by a court in his native Belarus which found him guilty of financing protests in a trial condemned by the United States and the European Union as a sham. Bialiatski, 60, was awarded the Nobel prize in October for his work promoting human rights and democracy in a country which President Alexander Lukashenko, a staunch ally of Russia, has ruled with an iron hand for nearly 30 years, violently locking up his opponents or forcing them to flee. Footage from the cramped Minsk court showed Bialiatski, who co-founded the Viasna (Spring) human rights group, looking sombre, his hands cuffed behind his back, as he and his co-defendants watched proceedings from a courtroom cage. Bialiatski, who was arrested in 2021, and three co-defendants were charged with financing protests and smuggling money. Belarusian state news agency Belta confirmed the court had handed down long jail sentences to all the men, including a decade in prison for Bialiatski. He denied the charges against him, saying they were politically motivated. Exiled Belarusian opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya said Bialiatski and the three other activists had been unfairly convicted, describing the court verdict as appalling. We must do everything to fight against this shameful injustice  free them, she said on Twitter. The other three men convicted were Valentin Stefanovich, sentenced to nine years, Vladimir Labkovich to seven years, and Dmitry Solovyov, who received eight years but was not present in court. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, calling on Twitter for the mens immediate release, described the court ruling as a sham and an attempt to suppress democracy and human rights in Belarus. Josep Borrell, the EUs foreign policy chief, described their trials as an attempt to silence them, a tactic he said would fail. Lukashenko will not succeed. Their call for freedom is loud, even behind bars, Borrell said in a statement. German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock called the trial a farce. The Minsk regime is fighting civil society with violence and imprisonment, Baerbock wrote on Twitter. She said it is as much a daily disgrace as Lukashenkos support for Russian President Vladimir Putins war in Ukraine. Berit Reiss-Andersen, leader of the Norwegian Nobel Committee, called Bialiatskis conviction a politically-motivated tragedy. The case, the verdict against him, is a tragedy for him personally. But it also shows that the regime in Belarus does not tolerate freedom of expression and opposition, she said in an interview in Oslo. Ravina Shamdasani, spokesperson for the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, told a briefing in Geneva that the United Nations body was disturbed by the trial and worried by the lack of fair trial proceedings and access to an independent judiciary in Belarus. That, she said, placed human rights defenders at risk of criminal prosecution for their legitimate activities. At the end of 2022, there were at least 1,446 people - including 10 children - being held, having faced or still facing criminal proceedings, said Shamdasani, without elaborating. Bialiatski, who was also a Soviet-era dissident, was one of the most prominent of hundreds of Belarusians who were jailed during a crackdown on months of anti-government protests that erupted in the summer of 2020 and continued into 2021. Viasna, the organisation he co-founded, took a leading role in providing legal and financial assistance to those jailed. Mass demonstrations took place after Lukashenko was declared the winner of the 2020 presidential election, a result which the opposition and Western countries said was fraudulent.

        "date": "March 4, 2023 01:59 pm",
        "content": "The Sri Lanka Standards Institution (SLS) says it is mandatory to display the SLS mark on local canned fish product labels, pursuant to the regulations of the Consumer Affairs Authority (CAA). In a press release, the SLSI mentioned that it has received multiple reports on local canned fish products that have been put up for sale without the SLS mark on the label. The members of the public are urged to file complaints with the CAA if they come across any such products. However, any complaints about SLS-certified canned fish items that are not up to the standards should be directed to the SLSI. The Standard Institution, noting that it follows a proper procedure when issuing the SLS certification for any locally-manufactured canned fish, said it is mandatory for the products and the manufacturing process to be in line with the standard parameters in order to receive the certification. The press release underscores that it is the responsibility of the CAA to take necessary action against uncertified local canned fish items sold in the market as the SLSI is tasked with ensuring the quality of the products that are put up for sale under various brand names. Further, the SLSI said although its certification is not required for imported canned fish products, the items are subjected to laboratory tests by the institution prior to Customs clearance. The SLSI says it has thus far issued the SLS certificate to the following 37 canned fish brands owned by 14 manufacturing firms: 01. Tess (Pvt) Ltd., No. 87, New Nuge Road, Kelaniya. 02. CM Fish Canning (Pvt) Ltd., Nadukkuda, Pesalai, Mannar. 03. Foreconns Canneries, No. 10, Temple Road, Beruwala. 04. SLIC Lanka Fisheries (Pvt) Ltd., 2801, Wewagedara, Divulapitiya. 05.

        "date": "March 5, 2023 08:24 am",
        "content": "JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP)  Indonesian rescuers and firefighters on Sunday searched for three people who were still missing under the rubble of charred houses and buildings, after a large fire spread from a fuel storage depot in the capital and killed at least 19 people. The Plumpang fuel storage station, operated by state-run oil and gas company Pertamina, is near a densely populated area in the Tanah Merah neighborhood in North Jakarta. It supplies 25 of Indonesias fuel needs. At least 260 firefighters and 52 fire engines extinguished the blaze just before midnight on Friday after it tore through the neighborhood for more than two hours, fire officials said. Footage showed hundreds of people running in panic as thick plumes of black smoke and orange flames filled the sky. National police chief Gen. Listyo Sigit Prabowo said a preliminary investigation showed the fire was caused by a technical problem involving excess pressure as the depot received fuel from Pertaminas Balongan Refinery in West Java province. It was found that a fire occurred during a filling of Pertamax fuel, Listyo told a news conference late Saturday, referring to a type of fuel oil produced by Pertamina. He didnt elaborate as investigators from Pertamina and the police were still working to establish the cause of the fire, including by questioning dozens of witnesses and examining video recordings from surveillance cameras. Residents living near the depot said they smelled a strong odor of gasoline, causing some people to vomit, after which thunder rumbled twice, followed by a huge explosion. Sri Haryati, a mother of three, said the fire began to spread about 20 minutes later, causing panic. I was crying and immediately grabbed our valuable documents and ran with my husband and children, Haryati said, adding that she heard smaller blasts that echoed across the neighborhood as orange flames jumped from the depot. Rescuers were still searching for three people who were reported missing. About 35 people were receiving treatment in five hospitals, some of them in critical condition. Listyo said more than 1,300 people were displaced and taking shelter in 10 government offices, a Red Cross command post and a sport stadium. Pertaminas head Nicke Widyawati apologized and said the company would provide help to the community and cooperate in the investigation. We will carry out a thorough evaluation and reflection internally to prevent similar incidents from happening again, Widyawati said in a statement, adding that the company ensured the safe supply of fuel oil. On Saturday, grieving relatives gathered at a police hospitals morgue in eastern Jakarta to try to identify their loved ones. Officials said the victims were burned beyond recognition and could only be identified through DNA and dental records. In 2014, a fire at the same fuel depot engulfed at least 40 houses, but no casualties were reported. Indonesias State Owned Enterprises Minister Erick Thohir told reporters that the government will remap safe zones for residential areas away from vital objects. He said the incident showed the Plumpang area is not safe for the community, and the government is planning to move the fuel storage depot to Tanjung Priok port in northern Jakarta.

        "content": "The government has reportedly drawn its attention towards granting a service extension to IGP C.D. Wickremeratne. However, it is further reported that a final decision has not been arrived at regarding the matter. The current IGP C.D. Wickramaratnes service period will end on March 20, 2023, and accordingly, he has handed over the documents required for his retirement recently. However, certain parties in the government have stated that it is more suitable to grant him a service extension. Thus, a decision will be taken regarding the matter, in the next week. Meanwhile, several names have been suggested for the post of IGP to be appointed, following the retirement of Mr. Wickremeratne. The Senior DIGs Nilantha Jayawardene, Lalith Pathinayake, Deshabandu Tennakoon, Priyantha Weerasooriya and Ajith Rohana have been nominated for the position so far. Nevertheless, a three-cornered competition has reportedly arisen between three Senior DIGs for the position of IGP. Meanwhile, preparations are also underway to appoint Senior DIG Lalith Pathinayake as the second officer in the Police Department, as per the sources. In contrast, it will be an additional qualification for him to be appointed for the post of IGP.",

        "date": "March 5, 2023 12:29 pm",
        "content": "Pointing to the large volume of India-China trade despite border tensions, Sabry said Sri Lanka wants to work with everyone but will not allow Indias legitimate security or other interests to be undermined under the guise of anything. Sri Lanka wont allow any country to make the island a hub for anything harmful to Indias national security, Sri Lankan foreign minister MUM Ali Sabry has said in the wake of bilateral ties taking a hit after a Chinese surveillance ship visited Hambantota port last year. In the context of strained India-China relations, Sabry said Sri Lanka wants to balance things to ensure peace. He lauded Indias role in helping Sri Lanka cope with an unprecedented economic crisis and said that his government plans to work more closely with New Delhi to bolster recovery, including a proposal for payments in national currencies. Asked about the fallout of Chinas Yuan Wang 5 vessel visiting Hambantota and external affairs minister S Jaishankars trip to Colombo, which is seen as an effort to reset ties, Sabry said, We managed to talk things through and we have made it very clear we will not allow any country to make Sri Lanka a hub...to do anything which will be harmful for Indias national security. He added, Indias relationship is one of the most, if not the most, important relationships in our foreign policy because of the size of the economy, the neighbourhood, the kind of things we share with each other. Pointing to the large volume of India-China trade despite border tensions, Sabry said Sri Lanka wants to work with everyone but will not allow Indias legitimate security or other interests to be undermined under the guise of anything. Sabry dispelled the impression that smaller countries are being forced to choose between India and China and said, We also must be smart enough to understand what is commerce, what is political interest, what is security threat...They will probably want to put their fingers in, but it cannot undermine somebody elses interests, particularly your neighbours and a neighbour who had been with us through thick and thin. Pointing to Indias key role in providing assurances to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for restructuring bilateral credit, Sabry said a letter provided by China on cooperating for Colombos Extended Fund Facility (EFF) application is not compatible with what IMF wants. He was hopeful a solution to the IMF bailout package will be clinched this month. Sabry outlined proposals for closer cooperation with India to drive Sri Lankas economic recovery, including an arrangement for payments in national currencies, energy linkages to transfer wind and solar power from Sri Lanka to India, and further development of the Trincomalee oil farm. We want to integrate and probably allow Indian currency to be a tradeable currency in Sri Lanka so that more Indians could come and use it, and Sri Lankans could use it without depending on third currencies, Sabry said. Sri Lanka and an Indian Oil Corporation subsidiary signed agreements last year to refurbish the oil storage facility at Trincomalee with a capacity of one million tonnes which could be developed as an energy hub for storage and refining, Sabry said. Sabry also spoke about efforts to devolve powers to Sri Lankas Tamil minority against the backdrop of Indias calls for implementing the 13th amendment to the Constitution and early conduct of provincial elections. Besides replacing the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA), Sri Lanka wants to put in place an accountability mechanism to deal with human rights issues from the civil war. Tamils need to feel they are also part of our country. A dignified environment needs to be built for them and we have done a lot of work, Sabry said, adding, This is why its important and we need to go for devolution. Its important for us. He spoke of a three-pronged approach that includes devolution of power, accountability on a Sri Lankan model within the contours of the Sri Lankan Constitution, and executive actions like releasing Tamil lands.

        "content": "Everything Everywhere All at Once swept the Independent Spirit Awards Saturday, taking home wins in nearly every major category and solidifying its Oscar frontrunner status. The kinetic, multiverse-spanning, family opus won numerous awards, including Best Film, Best Director and Best Editing. Comedian Hasan Minhaj hosted the star-studded event live from Santa Monica Beach, California. The annual award show honours the best in independent film and television. This year, for the first time in the awards 37-year history, the best actor categories were all gender neutral. Minhaj began the night with a hilarious and at times barbed roast of the nominees and the film industry. At one point, he embarrassed actress Cate Blanchett so much she crawled under the table. Actor Ke Huy Quan took home the first award of the night for Best Supporting Actor for his performance in Everything Everywhere. Quan, who has spent much of his career working behind the scenes, used his speech to praise the often-unsung crewmembers, from the boom operators to stunt coordinators, who make films possible. Later, Michelle Yeoh won for Best Lead Performance in the film and Stephanie Hsu took off her shoes to run onstage and accept the award for Best Breakthrough Performance. This is my first-ever individual award, and it feels incredibly appropriate that its in this room, Hsu said. It was also a big night for first-time nominees. Ayo Edebiri won Best Supporting Performance in a New Scripted Series for her role in The Bear. Actor Sheryl Lee Ralph, who was also nominated in the same category, later reflected on her how she spent much of her early career begging Hollywood to diversify. I stand here tonight having lost best supporting actress in television to Ayo, Ms Ralph said. I have to honestly say thats what change looks like. By far one of the most compelling moments of the night was when filmmaker Reid Davenports won the Truer than Fiction Award. Davenports film, I Didnt See You There, charts his everyday life as someone who navigates the world in a wheelchair due to his disability. There are so many disabled artists trying to get into this industry who are not given a chance, Mr Davenport said. I ask you humbly to let them in. Its time. Davenport said.

        "content": "India and Sri Lanka are exploring the possibility of using the Indian Rupee for economic transactions and have discussed the initiative that will help in building a stronger and closer partnership through trade and investment-led measures between the two countries. The High Commission of India here organised a discussion on the use of the Indian Rupee (INR) for transactions between India and Sri Lanka on Thursday. Representatives from the Bank of Ceylon, State Bank of India and the Indian Bank shared their experiences and informed the audience that they had started carrying out INR-denominated trade transactions through respective VostroNostro accounts after the creation of enabling framework by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) in 2022, the High Commission said in a statement. Governor of the CBSL, Dr P Nandalal Weerasinghe, highlighted the strong desire among Indian and Sri Lankan business communities for enabling trade settlements in INR. A team from RBI joined the discussion in the online format and indicated the possibility of settlement of current account transactions in goods, as well as services, in INR, apart from the option of undertaking permitted capital account transactions. The RBI team referred to the close cooperation with CBSL and RBIs commitment to further facilitate this process. Sri Lanka was hit by an unprecedented financial crisis in 2022, the worst since its independence from Britain in 1948, due to a severe paucity of foreign exchange reserves, sparking political turmoil in the country which led to the ouster of the all-powerful Rajapaksa family. The IMF in September last year approved Sri Lanka a 2.9 billion bailout package over 4 years pending Sri Lankas ability to restructure its debt with creditors - both bilateral and sovereign bondholders. With assurances from creditors, the 2.9 billion facilities could get the IMF board approval in March. Source - PTI -Agencies",

All operations are being completed with the cooperation of Lahore Police, the Islamabad police said on Twitter. Legal action will be taken against those obstructing the execution of court orders. A Pakistani court issued an arrest warrant against Khan last month after he did not appear in a hearing for a complaint filed by the Election Commission. Khan has been mostly confined to his home in Lahore since being shot and wounded in the leg during a street protest in November. He has blamed Premier Shehbaz Sharif, Interior Minister Rana Sanaullah, and a general in the countrys powerful spy agency, the Inter-Services Intelligence, for the attack. All three have denied the allegation. The Islamabad polices insistence for arrest is illegal since the court order is only to appear before it, Khans party spokesman Fawad Chaudhry said on Twitter.

        "date": "March 5, 2023 08:33 pm",
        "content": "Colombo sees the Adani projects in Sri Lanka as a government to government kind of deal, said Sri Lankan Foreign Minister MUM Ali Sabry, as it was the Indian government that had identified the Adani group for infrastructure projects including Northern Sri Lanka wind power project. Stressing that his government is very very confident that Adani Ports, Airports and Energy companies have strong fundamentals despite the 140 billion drop in share values after the publication of a negative report by US short-seller Hindenburg, Mr. Sabry said that the Adani group has already begun investing in its projects, which also include the 700 million Colombo West Container Port project. So, we are not panicking, Mr. Sabry told The Hindu. In an interview in New Delhi where he met with External Affairs Minister S.Jaishankar and participated in the MEAs Raisina Dialogue conference. Mr. Sabry said Sri Lanka is grateful for Indias assistance with the economic crisis, and hopes for more Indian investment in the next phase of its economic recovery, once it is able to receive a 2.9 billion bailout package from the International Monetary Fund, scheduled to meet next month. Q: Are Indias projects in Trincomalee, that have been pending since 2018 when the then Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe had first signed an MoU, now been given an impetus? A: Yes, I think there has been impetus all around. We have seen that Indian tourists are coming investors are coming, some of the big Indian companies have already started their projects on renewable energy, wind power as well as the port development. With the Trinco projects, those are in the pipeline and we do know that this is the time we have to materialise this promise given a long, long period of time ago. Q: One of those big Indian companies is the Adani group. Are you confident that the Adani companies involved in the Colombo port terminal project and Northern SL Wind power project can complete these projects, given the troubles theyve been in over the past month? A: We are very, very confident that they will do it and we also understand they do have footfalls in their airports and ports, both in India and outside, in railways, in renewable energy, and they are seen as a big company. This speculation on the stock market is not a new thing, this happens all over the world. So, we are not panicking at all. And we are very, very confident they will be able to complete the project. And this will become a precursor for much more investment to come from so many diverse investment institutions in India. So we are definitely not worried. Q: One of the allegations was that it was the pressure from the Prime Ministers Office in India that actually led to the wind power project being given to the Adani group. Do you think the Adani group comes with the confidence, the backing of the Prime Ministers office and thats why it gets these projects? A: Not really. In our case, of course, we were keen on an Indian investor to come in, so who the Indian investor was for the Indian government and the authorities to decide and choose and send it to us. And then we will have our own feasibility and fact-finding, and if we are happy, we will take it. So thats how it happens all over the world. So we are happy. And we have no complaint, so far, because they have been investing, theyre going on with the project. And they have been successful both in India and in the region. So why not? A big name like that comes in. And there are a lot of other countries and other companies could be envious of them. For us, there is absolutely nothing to worry about, because it is a transparent process and a government-to-government kind of a project. And then of course G2G doesnt mean that the government gets involved and is doing business, it means the government identifies the entities. So that is the process which had been followed in the Adanis coming into Sri Lanka. Q: So its seen as a government approved project. Even though they have lost 140 billion in market capitalisation, are you convinced these projects will be completed on time? A: Yeah, no, the problem is that the stock market is a very vulnerable thing. Companies go up and down  Facebook has lost market capitalisation, and the big timers, particularly in the tech industry have lost. It goes up and down but doesnt mean that the project is in trouble. They have the capital, they have the foundation, and these projects are ongoing. So people can have their own valuation, on speculation, on the growth potential and all those things. Merely because the stock market goes down doesnt mean that your project on the ground will get wiped out all of a sudden. That investment has come in. Thats what I heard from my investment ministers. Q: Last year India protested quite vocally about the docking of a Chinese naval ship in Hambantota Port  has Sri Lanka given India assurances that this kind of controversy will not recur? A: I think its a complex relationship. Sri Lanka has been a very close friend of India and doesnt want to do anything which hurts the Indian legitimate sentiments on security concerns. But in the meantime, one also needs to understand that we need to work with everybody. Despite all the problems China is also Indias biggest trading partner. Similarly, we also want to work with Indians and the Chinese and the West and everybody. But in the meantime, for any legitimate security concerns of Indians, we will find a way to discuss with them collaborate with them, and identify them. And not to repeat anything that could be a concern. But in the meantime, we also want to ensure the freedom of movement in the Indian Ocean for everybodys betterment. Source - The Hindu -Agencies",

        "content": "Sri Lanka has once again expressed the countrys objection to resolution 511 adopted against the island nation by the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) in October last year. During a recent general meeting at the 52nd session of the UNHRC, Sri Lankas Permanent Representative to the United Nations Office in Geneva Himalee Arunathilaka has noted that such resolutions are unhelpful to the people of Sri Lanka and will fail to serve the objective of promoting reconciliation in the country. A new resolution titled Promoting reconciliation, accountability and human rights in Sri Lanka, which was tabled at the 51st Regular Session of the United Nations Human Rights Council was adopted with majority votes on the 6th of October last year. A total of 20 countries including the United Kingdom, the United States and France voted in favour of the Resolution while 7 countries including China and Pakistan voted against it. At least 20 countries including India and Japan abstained from voting for or against the resolution. Through resolution 511, the United Nations High Commissioner encourages the international community to support Sri Lanka in its recovery, however, highlights the need to address the underlying causes of the crisis, including impunity for human rights violations and economic crimes. Addressing the 51st UNHRC session in October last year, Sri Lankan Foreign Affairs Minister Ali Sabry categorically rejected the resolution stating that it had been presented without the countrys consent or consultation. Meanwhile in Geneva on March 3, the Sri Lankan Permanent Mission once again expressed Sri Lankas objection to resolution 511. Addressing a General segment of the 52nd session of the UNHRC on Friday, the Sri Lankan Permanent Representative in Geneva Himalee Arunatilaka noted that these resolutions are unhelpful to the people of Sri Lanka as they will polarise the society and fail to serve the objective of promoting reconciliation in Sri Lanka. She said this is an unproductive drain on the scarce resources of UN Member States which can be productively deployed elsewhere. Arunatilaka said that despite Sri Lankas opposition to country-specific resolutions, the country remains open to engaging in constructive discussion with the Council, Special Procedures and Treaty Bodies. The Sri Lankan Representative further noted that Sri Lanka looks forward to a meaningful dialogue when the countrys 6th Periodic Report of the Office of the High Commission for Human Rights is taken up for review later this month under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.",
