        "title": "Sri Lanka risks IMF roadblock as local debt plan gets few takers",
        "date": "April 21, 2023 10:40 am",
        "content": "(Bloomberg)  Sri Lankas plan for a voluntary restructuring of its domestic debt is finding few takers from local banks worried about a hit to their capital, raising the risk of a delay in the countrys financial rescue. Some of the nations biggest lenders including Commercial Bank of Ceylon Plc. and Hatton National Bank Plc warn that a local debt restructuring will lead to capital impairment as banks are forced to set aside more money to cover losses. Already the banking sector is taking a toll on haircuts on dollar bonds, said Sanath Manatunge, chief executive officer at Commercial Bank of Ceylon. For liquidity and statutory reasons, we have to have some bills and bonds. If that is also going to be subject to a haircut, then the industry might lose its resilience. The countrys biggest challenge after securing a 3 billion bailout from the International Monetary Fund in March is to reach a restructuring deal with creditors that would make its debt sustainable in the eyes of the Washington-based lender. Banks reluctance to participate in a domestic-debt restructuring could complicate the process, which authorities hope to conclude before the first IMF review slated for September. Authorities agreed to include local-currency bonds in the restructuring program as they sought to appease overseas investors who are demanding that domestic debt holders should also share billions of dollars of losses. Sri Lankas external borrowings totaled 41 billion, while its local currency debt stood at around 38 billion in 2022, according to the IMF. Sri Lankan lenders capital buffers are already depleted and if they are further affected by debt restructuring, that would make raising fresh funds harder, Aruni Goonetilleke, chairperson of Hatton National Bank, said at an Asian Development Bank event earlier this month. Only Treasury bills held by the central bank, which owns about two-thirds of the nations around 11.4 billion in the securities are currently included in the debt treatment, officials have said. Sri Lanka also has 24 billion worth of T-bonds, most of which are held by domestic banks and local retirement funds and are subject to voluntary restructuring. One way to push through the debt overhaul would be to restructure bonds held by the nations Superannuation funds, provided their cash flow can be serviced, said Suhini Fernando, chief executive of Reliance Capital (Pvt) Ltd., a Colombo-based investment consultancy. That would have the least economic impact, while offering a bigger effect on reducing the nations gross financing needs as per the IMF parameters, Fernando said. Sri Lanka is expected to unveil its debt restructuring blueprint by the end of April. -Agencies",

        "date": "April 21, 2023 12:10 pm",
        "content": "Twitter removed the legacy blue tick from verified accounts yesterday. This comes months after the companys CEO Elon Musk announced the date to press users to sign up for Twitter Blue, its paid subscription service. Due to the recent development, many celebrities and noted personalities across various domains lost their coveted verification check mark. With the launch of Twitter Blue, only users who are subscribed to it will be able to have a blue checkmark in front of their names along with access to some brand-new features. However, basketball star LeBron James and author Stephen King still retained their checkmarks despite publicly announcing that they would not sign up for the service. It was later informed by the CEO of the company that he is personally paying for the Twitter Blue subscriptions of some celebrities to keep their checkmark. This came to light after American author Stephen King took to the microblogging website and said, My Twitter account says Ive subscribed to Twitter Blue. I havent. My Twitter account says Ive given a phone number. I havent. Replying to the same, Musk said, Youre welcome namaste along with a folding hand emoji. In a separate tweet, Mr Musk informed, Im paying for a few personally. Later, he tweeted, Just Shatner, LeBron and King, referring to Star Trek star William Shatner, who had last month complained about being forced to pay to keep his blue checkmark. Former US President Donald Trump, Microsoft Co-Founder Bill Gates and reality TV star Kim Kardashian were among those who lost their badges. Several Indian celebrities including Shah Rukh Khan, Amitabh Bachchan, Alia Bhatt and politicians like CM Yogi Adityanath, Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi and cricketers Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma among others have also lost their verified blue ticks from their Twitter accounts. The company introduced the blue check mark system in 2009 to help users identify that celebrities, politicians, companies and brands, news organisations and other accounts of public interest were genuine and not impostors or parody accounts. The company didnt previously charge for verification. Source  NDTV - Agencies",

        "content": "The use of Prednisolone, an eye drop imported from India, has been withdrawn with immediate effect, as per a directive issued by the Ministry of Health. Accordingly, the Medical Supplies Division (MSD) of the Ministry noted that the supply of the drug to all hospitals has also been suspended. Speaking on the matter, Dr. Prasad Colombage, a member of the executive committee of the Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) stated that all general procedures and surgeries at the National Eye Hospital have been temporarily halted since 14 April after a few patients were diagnosed with a concerning bacterial infection in the eye. Dr. Colombage further stated that the suspected cause for the said infections and complications suffered post-surgery by the patients is believed to be the use of the Indian eye drop. Thus, he called on the Ministry of Health to take all required measures in this regard, and to conduct further investigations and tests on the imported drug. Meanwhile, he also added that the National Eye Hospital expects to resume to normalcy on Monday (24 April). This is the second time the Ministry of Health has withdrawn the use of an Indian drug within local hospitals. Earlier this month, the MSD temporarily withdrew the use of three categories of an anaesthetic drug used for surgeries in Sri Lanka. They explained that the decision was taken owing to the fact that the quality of the drug cannot be tested within the island, and was brought based solely on its performance in other countries and the relevant certificates provided by India.",

        "content": "British Deputy Prime Minister and justice minister Dominic Raab resigned on Friday, following an independent investigation into formal complaints of bullying. In a letter to Prime Minister Rishi Sunak published on Twitter, Raab said the inquiry had set a dangerous precedent, but that he would remain supportive of the government. I called for the inquiry and undertook to resign, if it made any finding of bullying whatsoever. I believe it is important to keep my word, Raab said. However, he added: In setting the threshold for bullying so low, this inquiry has set a dangerous precedent. It will encourage spurious complaints against Ministers, and have a chilling effect on those driving change on behalf of your government - and ultimately the British people. Raabs resignation means a third senior minister has departed over their personal conduct since Sunak entered Downing Street in October promising a government of integrity.

Dolawatte, with the Constitution of Sri Lanka. The court announced its decision this morning (21 April), after concluding the hearing of a petition filed against the proposed Bill. The relevant petition was heard before a three-judge bench of the Supreme Court, comprising of Chief Justice Jayantha Jayasuriya and Justices Vijith Malalgoda and Arjun Obeysekera. Accordingly, the court ordered that all written submissions pertaining to the petition in question be filed on or before 24 April. A petition was filed by Retired Army Brigadier K. Athula H. de Silva, Shenali D. Waduge and Jehan Hameed, naming MP Dolawatte and the Attorney General as the respondents, seeking an order that if the proposed Penal Code (Amendment) Bill is required to be passed, it must be approved by a two-thirds majority vote in the Parliament and also a referendum, since the provisions contained in the proposed bill violate the fundamental human rights mentioned in the Constitution. The petitioners alleged that the relevant Bill tabled as a private members Bill by MP Dolawatte attempted to interpret homosexuality as a non-criminal offence, while promoting such activities. The petition also mentions that it is contrary to the expectations of the legislature regarding the penal code and thereby seriously violates the provisions of the constitution, adding that certain provision of the Bill in question are also against religious beliefs, as homosexual activities have not been endorsed in accordance with Buddhist, Hindu, Christian or Islamic beliefs.",

        "date": "April 21, 2023 05:48 pm",
        "content": "Sri Lanka has launched the project to build the largest commercial and logistics complex in South Asia in the Port of Colombo with an investment of USD 392 million. Agreements for the construction and operation of the South Asia Commercial and Logistics Hub (SACL) as a 50-year Build Operate-Transfer (BOT) project were formally signed in Colombo by the representatives of the three investing entities. Accordingly, China Merchants Port Holdings (CMPort) holds a 70 stake while Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA) and Access Engineering PLC (Access) each hold a 15 stake in the venture A Public Private Partnership (PPP) project, the South Asia Commercial and Logistics will be built in the centre of the Colombo Port and will have 530,000 CBM of storage capacity via an eight-floor building. The investment in the project is expected to bring in much-needed foreign investment into Sri Lanka. The construction of the complex is expected to begin in the second half of 2023 with a target of completion by the end of 2025. Adjacent to Port City and the CBD, it will be directly linked with the airport via the Port Access Elevated Highway. The five million square foot complex will offer the full gamut of logistics related facilities and services such as Less than Container Load (LCL), Multi-Country Consolidation (MCC), Container Freight Station (CFS), general warehousing and various other value-added services. A Spokesperson for CMPort said the project will result in an infusion of US 126 million in addition to an upfront payment of US 26 million after the agreement is signed. The project is also expected to provide direct employment to a minimum of 1,800 people and create 10,500 other indirect job opportunities. The project aligns with Sri Lankas national development strategy to transform the country into a major logistics centre, identified as a key sector and a driving force for economic development in the National Policy Framework (NPF) 2019. It will provide better logistics and warehousing facilities and services, enhancing the Ports competitive advantage and consequently strengthening its Hub status. The project will also improve the operational efficiency of the Port of Colombo and introduce leading-edge technology and innovation. The Port of Colombo is currently ranked among the top 13 ports in the world in terms of shipping network connectivity. Despite its ideal location on the international trading route, the Port still lacks a modern, state-of-the-art logistics facility, the Spokesperson said. At present, mainly loading and discharging of cargo is done at the Port of Colombo, with little value-added services being offered. SACL will change this landscape. Additionally, since the Port of Colombo was declared as a Freeport by the Government of Sri Lanka, the project will enjoy the associated Freeport advantages in its operations, such as no customs clearance for transshipment and MCC cargo, resulting in reduced paperwork and associated costs. The project also provides an ideal platform for the registration of hub companies - which will enjoy tax concessions in CIT, WHT, VAT, etc. The project is expected to help the Port of Colombo to strengthen its competitiveness against other competing ports in the region. Furthermore, the improved services and cost benefits provided by the project are expected to attract more business and container volumes to the Port of Colombo, benefitting all its terminals and generating higher revenues for the Port and port-related companies in Sri Lanka. CMPort, the major shareholder in the South Asia Commercial and Logistics Hub, is the parent company of Colombo International Container Terminals (CICT) which manages the South Terminal of the Port of Colombo. CMPort is the largest and a globally-competitive public port developer, investor and operator in China with investments in Mainland China, Hong Kong and overseas. CMPort has a port network portfolio spanning SO ports in 26 countries and regions. Guided by the vision To be a world class comprehensive port service provider and supported by its domestic, overseas and innovation strategies, CMPort strives to strengthen its core competencies in global throughput, port service and management.",

He was initially informed to make an appearance at the TID on April 19 to record a statement pertaining to his controversial comment on a massive conspiracy behind the 2019 Easter Sunday terror attacks. However, the former Attorney Generals lawyer appeared before the TID on that day and submitted a seven-page legal objection on his behalf. De Livera was then asked to report to the TID today (April 21), but he failed to comply with the summons. It has been decided to notify the court if the former Attorney General fails to appear before the TID once again on April 24. On 18 May, then-Attorney General Dappula de Livera claimed that there had been a conspiracy behind the series of bomb attacks that took place on 21 April 2019, killing 269 persons and injuring over 500 others. Livera infamously handled the Easter Sunday inquiry right from the beginning while he served as the Solicitor General before being appointed as Attorney General on 29 April 2019, just eight days after the Easter Sunday attacks. He later retired on 25 May 2021, while acting AG Sanjaya Rajaratnam was appointed as his successor.",

During his address at the Business Today Top 40 Awards Ceremony at the Presidential Secretariat in Colombo on Thursday (April 20), the Head of State highlighted the need for a strong, export-oriented economy. He emphasized the importance of engaging in comprehensive economic and technological collaborations with India and negotiating entry into the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), while maintaining RCEP standards and remaining open to possibilities. The President further emphasized the need for modernizing and updating traditional sectors such as agriculture, fisheries, logistics, and tourism. Wickremesinghe also discussed the challenges that Sri Lanka faces this year and called for private-sector involvement in tackling these challenges. He revealed that the government has set aside LKR 1 billion for Artificial Intelligence (AI) next year, with a focus on green energy technologies and renewable energy. Wickremesinghe went on to outline the governments plans to pursue the Comprehensive and Progressive Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) after RCEP, for which the government has already established criteria.

        "date": "April 21, 2023 11:59 pm",
        "content": "Sri Lankans of all faiths joined hands and observed two minutes of silence on Friday, 21 April, giving voice to their support for the Catholic Churchs quest for truth and justice over the attacks that killed more than 260 people and injured at least 500 on Easter Sunday 2019. The human chain initiative, on the theme We are Watching until Justice is Done, was spearheaded by His Eminence Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith, the Archbishop of Colombo, who has been tireless in his push for a transparent investigation and demand for accountability. On the eve of the anniversary, he told Vatican Radio the human chain would symbolically unite St. Anthonys church in Colombo and St. Sebastians church in Negombo where the attacks wreaked most death and destruction. So far, he added, The government, the security authorities, the intelligence services, have not done anything much on this matter and they have tried to put the blame on the Muslims and to say that it is the Muslims who did it. But, the Cardinal continued, there is evidence and we have indications that the attacks were carried out by some fundamentalist extremists who were facilitated by government sources and political parties in order to create Islamophobia in this country. The idea, he explained was to make use of this Islamophobia in their push for power by gaining the votes of the majority Sinhalese community, by fuelling anger against the Muslims. Now this attempt has been exposed, but we want that to be firmly and clearly found out. That is why, Cardinal Ranjith said, We are asking for a fresh investigation, a transparent investigation, and the human chain aims to highlight that determination. The Cardinal of Colombo confirmed that members of all faith groups would be participating in the human chain. In particular, he said, The Muslims have declared, publicly, that they are with us, especially as are the ones who have been instrumentalized by what happened, so they are coming in large numbers because things have been clarified. Reiterating that the attacks were perpetrated by extremists, the Sri Lankan Cardinal said behind them There is a political force we want to identify. Meanwhile, it is clear the authorities are unhappy about the human chain, he said and have done their best to try and stop the initiative by creating diversions by saying that some Muslim mosques are under threat from attack and so on. But, he explained, these are tactics they have always used and the people in Sri Lanka are well aware of what he called this kind of false strategy. The people, Cardinal Ranjith concluded, will not accept this so the politicians will have to understand that they cannot carry on doing things like that. -Agencies",

        "title": "Lebanese-Canadian professor convicted of Paris synagogue bombing after four decades",
        "date": "April 22, 2023 09:10 am",
        "content": "More than 42 years after the deadly bombing of a Paris synagogue, a court in Paris has convicted a Lebanese-Canadian university professor of carrying out the attack. The judges decided that Hassan Diab, 69, was the young man who planted the motorcycle bomb in the Rue Copernic on 3 October 1980. Four people were killed and 38 others wounded in the bombing. Diab called his situation Kafkaesque, Canadian media reported. He refused to attend the trial but the judges gave him a life sentence. Prosecutors had argued it was beyond possible doubt that he was behind the bombing. His supporters have condemned the trial as manifestly unfair. The Rue Copernic attack was the first to target Jews in France since World War Two, and became a template for many other similar attacks linked to militants in the Middle East in the years that followed. The decades-long investigation became a byword both for protracted judicial confusion, as well as for the dogged determination of a handful of magistrates not to let the case be forgotten. Diab is a Lebanese of Palestinian origin who obtained Canadian nationality in 1993 and teaches sociology in Ottawa. He was first named as a suspect on the basis of new evidence in 1999, already nearly 20 years after the killings. Eight years later the French issued an international arrest warrant, and it was not until 2014 that Canada agreed to extradite. But in 2018 French magistrates declared the case closed for lack of proof, allowing Diab to return to Canada. Finally in 2021 an appeal against the closure of the case was upheld in the Supreme Court, the first time this had ever happened in a French terrorism case. It meant a trial could finally go ahead, and it began earlier this month. From the start Diab, protested his innocence and he did not return to France for the trial, which was conducted in his absence. His conviction means that a second extradition request will have to follow, though with strong doubts over whether it will succeed. According to the Canadian Press news agency, Diab said on Friday that we hoped reason would prevail. Responding to the verdict, the Hassan Diab Support Committee in Canada called on Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to make it absolutely clear that no second extradition would be accepted. They said 15 years of legal nightmare... is now fully exposed in its overwhelming cruelty and injustice. At a news conference, Mr Trudeau said his government will look carefully at next steps, at what the French government chooses to do, at what French tribunals choose to do. But we will always be there to stand up for Canadians and their rights, he added. Over three weeks the court heard an account of the known facts of the case, plus arguments identifying Diab as the bomber and counter-evidence suggesting he was a victim of mistaken identity. None of the original investigating team was alive to speak, and the surviving witnesses who saw the attacker in 1980 all admitted that after more than 40 years their memories were too hazy to be reliable. The bomb was left in the saddle-bag of a Suzuki motorbike outside a synagogue in the wealthy 16th arrondissement of Paris. Had there not been a delay, the pavement would have been packed with people leaving the religious service inside. In 1980 the investigation initially centred on neo-Nazis, and there were mass demonstrations by the political left. But a claim by an ultra-right group was found to be fake, and by the end of the year attention had switched to a Middle East connection. The bomber was identified as having a fake Cypriot passport bearing the name Alexander Panadriyu. He was believed to have entered France from another European country as part of a larger group, and to have bought the motorbike at a shop near the Arc de Triomphe. He was thought to belong to a dissident Palestinian group called the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-Special Operations (PFLP-SO). But the investigation hit a wall, and it was not till 1999 that Hassan Diabs name emerged from new information, believed to emanate from the former Soviet bloc. Italian authorities then revealed that in 1981 the passport of a Hassan Diab had been found at Rome airport in the possession of a senior figure from the PFLP-SO. The passport bore stamps showing the holder entering and leaving Spain around the dates of the Rue Copernic attack. The core of the prosecution case rested on the passport. Under questioning while in custody, Diab explained that he had lost the passport just a month before the attack. But in Lebanon a French judge found an official declaration for the lost passport - a declaration made in 1983 and with a date of loss in April 1981. The defence argued that all of this was circumstantial, and that there was still no hard evidence that Diab was in France in October 1980. They produced testimony from friends in Beirut who said Diab had been sitting university exams at the time of the attack. Handwriting analysts who said the hotel registration form signed by the attacker was consistent with Diabs script were also dismissed as inconclusive. The only decision that is juridically possible - even if its on a human level a difficult one - is acquittal, defence lawyer William Bourdon said in his summing-up Thursday. I am here before you to prevent a judicial error. But prosecutor Benjamin Chambre, while regretting that all the other members of the terrorist group had escaped without charge, said: With Hassan Diab, we have the bomb-maker and the bomb-planter. Thats already something. Source: BBC -Agencies",

Army chief Fattah al-Burhan agreed to facilitate and secure their evacuation in the coming hours, it said. He is locked in a bitter power struggle with the leader of a rival paramilitary faction, the Rapid Support Forces. The UK government said it was preparing for a number of contingencies. Previous plans to evacuate foreign nationals have not been implemented because of safety fears. Khartoums international airport has been closed due to the violence, with foreign embassies - including the UK and US - unable to bring their citizens home. The conflict has entered its second week despite both sides - the army and the RSF - agreeing to a three-day ceasefire to mark the Muslim holiday of Eid al-Fitr, starting from Friday. Sporadic gunfire and air strikes were heard in the capital on Saturday despite the truce. A former foreign minister, Mariam al-Mahdi, who is sheltering in Khartoum told the BBC the ceasefire was not taking at all. We are out of electricity for the last 24 hours. We are out of water for the last six days, she said. Medical teams are being targeted in the fighting, she said, adding: There are rotting bodies of our youth in the streets. Source  BBC - Agencies",

        "date": "April 22, 2023 09:43 pm",
        "content": "The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO, together with the European Union (EU), today (22 April) officially launched a new programme to strengthen food security in Sri Lanka by boosting the productivity and sustainability of the paddy cultivation sector. The four million Euro (approximately Rs. 1.5 billion) initiative funded by the EU was initiated at an event held at the Bataatha Agro Technology park in Hambanthota under the auspices of the Minister of Agriculture Mahinda Amaraweera, EU Ambassador to Sri Lanka Denis Chaibi and FAO Representative in Sri Lanka Vimlendra Sharan. Implemented by FAO with the support of the Ministry of Agriculture and the Mahaweli Authority, the programme targets 71,000 smallholder paddy farmers and 1,200 paddy seed farmers across seven districts including Polonnaruwa, Badulla, Ampara, Matale, Puttalam, Kurunegala and Hambantota districts who were severely impacted by the recent economic crisis. Speaking at the event, which saw the official start of the farmer field schools EU Ambassador to Sri Lanka, Denis Chaibi said, With this new action, we want to help farmers not only to grow more, but most importantly to grow better so that they can increase their production and incomes, but also protect the environment around them. We hope that together with FAO and the Government of Sri Lanka we can gradually promote a transition towards greener and climate-smart agriculture. Transition that produces sufficient amount of food, while protecting the planet and its people. The recipient farmers will receive material and technical support to transition from traditional cultivation methods into climate-smart, modern farming techniques. Accordingly, the eligible paddy farmers cultivating up to 0.5 hectares of land will receive 50 kilograms of urea fertilizer and the necessary tools to enhance efficiency of fertilizer use. A total of 3,820 tonnes of urea fertilizer procured by the programme were already handed over to the Ministry of Agriculture to be distributed among selected smallholder paddy farmers and paddy seed farmers. Paddy seed farmers supported through the programme will also receive locally produced, high quality paddy seeds alongside material support such as parachute trays to improve efficiency and profitability of cultivation methods. Furthermore, all recipients will be enrolled in farmer-field schools to improve knowledge sharing on modern techniques such as the Integrated Plant Nutrient Management (IPNM) strategy to boost efficiency and reduce dependency on the use of chemical fertilizer. Minister Amaraweera expressed his appreciation to the FAO and the EU for the implementation of a holistic programme aimed at improving the sustainability of Sri Lankas paddy sector. Our paddy farmers underwent significant challenges over the past few years. This support we received from FAO and the EU is a testament to their perseverance during the tough times, for which we are thankful. These inputs and knowledge sharing will no doubt elevate the quality of rice production and the livelihoods of Sri Lankan paddy farmers, he said. This programme marks an important milestone in FAOs work in Sri Lanka over the past year  the shift back into development from the emergency response. We are grateful for the support we have received from the EU to implement this programme, which aims to address some of the longstanding concerns in the local paddy sector, to reach better production, leading to better nutrition, a better environment and improve food security for all Sri Lankans, FAO Representative in Sri Lanka, Vimlendra Sharan said. The EU and FAO have assured their continued support to work closely with the government of Sri Lanka and key partners to support the recovery of the agriculture sector, while also building resilience and sustainability into the sector to increase yield and profit for smallholder farmers as the sector recovers.",

        "content": "Marking the 75th anniversary of the establishment of Indo-Lanka diplomatic relations, which falls this year, two photographs of Sri Lankan origin were unveiled at the office of the State Minister of External Affairs and Culture of India at the National Gallery of Modern Art in New Delhi on Saturday (April 22). The photographs, which were installed at the office of Indias State Minister of External Affairs and Culture Meenakshi Lekhi, feature two murals painted by the eminent Sri Lankan painter Solias Mendis in the Kelaniya Rajamaha Vihara. The first mural depicts Arahat Mahinda, King Ashokas son, delivering the message of the Buddha to King Devanampiyatissa upon arriving in Sri Lanka. The second mural depicts the arrival to Sri Lanka of Theri Sanghamitta, King Ashokas daughter, bearing the right-hand branch sapling of the Sri Maha Bodhi tree. These two historical events that occurred in the 3rd century BCE marked the commencement of a Buddhist civilization in Sri Lanka and epitomize the strong and unbreakable civilizational bonds that exist between Sri Lanka and India. The photographs were ceremonially unveiled by State Minister Smt. Meenakshi Lekhi and Sri Lankas High Commissioner to India Milinda Moragoda in the presence of the Venerable members of the Maha Sangha from Sri Lanka led by the Most Venerable Waskaduwe Mahindawansa Maha Nayaka Thero who were in New Delhi to attend the Global Buddhist Summit. Director General of the Department of Archaeology of Sri Lanka Prof. Anura Manatunga, Director General of the International Buddhist Confederation Abhijit Halder and senior officials of the High Commission of Sri Lanka in New Delhi were also present on this occasion. Prof. Manatunga gave a brief description of the temple murals depicted in the photographs at the unveiling ceremony. Previously, in October 2021, the High Commission of Sri Lanka in New Delhi presented two photographs depicting the same murals, to be installed at the newly inaugurated international airport in Kushinagar. Similar photographs were installed at the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) Headquarters in Nagpur in February 2022, and at the Ahmedabad International Airport in July 2022. As part of an ongoing programme to celebrate the 75th anniversary of Indo-Lanka diplomatic relations, action has also been initiated to install similar photographs at other locations in India, including at the international airports in Buddha Gaya and Varanasi shortly, enhancing Sri Lankas cultural footprint at the level of the States of the Union of India.",

        "date": "April 23, 2023 09:10 am",
        "content": "The US military has evacuated American diplomats and their families from Khartoum, Sudans paramilitary army Rapid Support Forces (RSF) has said. Six aircraft were used in Sundays early morning mission, the RSF tweeted, adding that it had worked with the US to coordinate the evacuation. It is not clear how many people were airlifted. The US has not commented. It is the second evacuation of foreign citizens since violence erupted in Sudans capital Khartoum last week. In its tweet, the RSF said it supervised the arrangements and provided protection to those being evacuated. Details of the mission remain unclear. Arabic news service Al Hadath reported that the six aircraft landed in the embassy compound, and several Twitter users posted that they could hear helicopter activity over the US embassy, however the BBC has been unable to verify this. The US has now closed its embassy in Khartoum, unnamed US officials say. Khartoum airport has been repeatedly targeted by shelling and gunfire, making evacuation flights from there impossible. On Saturday, more than 150 citizens, diplomats and international officials were evacuated by sea to the Saudi Arabian port of Jeddah. They were mostly citizens of Gulf countries, as well as Egypt, Pakistan and Canada. The UK says it is considering ways to evacuate its staff. A hotline has been set up for those who need urgent help, and UK citizens in Sudan are being urged to tell the Foreign Office where they are. Any UK evacuation is expected to be very limited and focus on diplomatic staff - not comparable to the mass evacuation from Afghanistan in 2021. Meanwhile the Canadian government has told its citizens in Sudan to shelter in a safe place. Describing the security situation as highly volatile, the Canadian government travel advice tells citizens to keep their phones charged, their doors and windows locked and consider leaving the country if theres a safe means to do so. Violence broke out in Khartoum on 15 April. At the heart of the fighting is a power struggle between forces loyal to Sudanese army chief Abdel Fatteh al-Burhan and a rival paramilitary faction, the Rapid Support Forces (RSF). The near constant shooting and bombardment in Khartoum and elsewhere has cut electricity and safe access to food and water for much of the population. Several ceasefires that had seemingly been agreed by both sides were ignored, including a three-day pause to mark the Muslim holiday of Eid al-Fitr, which started on Friday. UK citizens stranded and frustrated UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak chaired an emergency government Cobra meeting on Saturday to assess the Sudan crisis and more talks are expected on Sunday. Foreign Secretary James Cleverly has cut short a Pacific tour and is returning to London. Some UK nationals trapped in Sudan have voiced frustration and anxiety over the absence of an airlift. Briton Iman Abu Garga, visiting Khartoum, said she had registered herself and her two children, as instructed, and since then - nothing. We have no idea about timescale or timeframe. We have no idea what its going to look like. Are we going to be airlifted out of Khartoum airport? Are we going to have to go by road? Its just utterly frustrating that there is no human contact whatsoever, she complained. Another British citizen in Khartoum told the BBC she felt completely abandoned by the UK government, saying she had not been given much information at all about possible evacuation plans. On Saturday a Sudanese army statement said Gen Burhan had agreed to facilitate and secure foreigners evacuation in the coming hours. It said British, US, French and Chinese nationals and diplomats would be evacuated by air on board military transport planes from Khartoum. The UK government said it was doing everything possible to support British nationals and diplomatic staff in Khartoum. Spains defence minister said six planes were being sent to Djibouti as part of the countrys efforts to evacuate Spanish nationals and others. The World Health Organization says more than 400 people have been killed. The death toll is believed to be much higher as people struggle to reach hospitals. Thousands of people, mainly civilians, have also been injured, with medical centres under pressure to deal with the influx of patients. Along with Khartoum, the western region of Darfur, where the RSF first emerged, has also been badly affected by the fighting. The UN has warned that up to 20,000 people - mostly women and children - have fled Sudan to seek safety in Chad, across the border from Darfur. Source: BBC -Agencies",

        "date": "April 23, 2023 11:41 am",
        "content": "The Attorney Generals Department has decided to file a case before a commercial court in Singapore tomorrow (April 24) against the shipping company of MV X-Press Pearl which sank off the western coast of Sri Lanka after being gutted in a massive fire two years ago. Thereby, the Attorney Generals Department will demand compensation for the massive environmental damage caused by the shipwreck. Sri Lanka witnessed what is considered one of the worst marine environmental disasters after the Singapore-flagged container ship vessel, only three months after being commissioned, caught fire some 16 kilometers off Colombo on May 20, 2021, while transporting 1,500 containers including 25 tonnes of nitric acid. The fire that continued for nearly two weeks resulted in a massive spillage of damaged containers, microplastics, plastic pellets, chemicals and other harmful substances into the sea. Following the disaster, the Marine Environment Protection Authority (MEPA) appointed a committee of experts comprising professors and other relevant top public officials to assess the damage. Earlier, the MEPA said it has provided all necessary documents to the Attorney Generals Department to prosecute the ship owner or the operator or the ships agents in Sri Lanka under the Criminal Law, in terms of Section 26 of the Prevention of Maritime Corruption Act. As the approval of the Cabinet of Ministers was previously given to continue the litigation process in Singapore, the Attorney Generals Department recently mentioned that it is proceeding with the legal matter accordingly. However, the committee of expert lawyers appointed to look into the matter has suggested that the prosecution be done in Sri Lanka to recover the estimated USD 6.2 billion in damages. The decision to continue the legal proceedings in Singapore attracted criticism as it was deemed a very costly move. The MEPA, however, explained that the Australian law firm, which is assisting the Attorney Generals Department with the civil suit to claim compensation, has advised that carrying out the litigation process in Singapore is favourable to the island nation. Meanwhile, Justice Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe revealed that he has been tipped off on several occasions about a local official being bribed by the insurer of the X-Press Pearl According to him, speculations are rife that a local official has received a bribe of USD 250 million from the vessels insurers to hinder the litigation and compensation processes. The justice minister said he has given directives to the Inspector-General of Police and the DIG in charge of the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) to initiate an investigation to uncover the truth.",

        "content": "Kenyan police have exhumed 21 bodies near the coastal town of Malindi, as they investigate a preacher said to have told followers to starve to death. Dead children were among those exhumed, and police said they expected to find even more bodies. The shallow graves are in Shakahola forest, where 15 members of the Good News International Church were rescued last week. Preacher Paul Mackenzie Nthenge is in custody, pending a court appearance. State broadcaster KBC described him as a cult leader, and reported that 58 graves have so far been identified. One of the graves is believed to contain the bodies of five members of the same family  three children and their parents. Mr Mackenzie has denied wrongdoing, but has been refused bail. He insists that he shut down his church in 2019. He allegedly told followers to starve themselves in order to meet Jesus. The Kenyan daily The Standard said pathologists will take DNA samples and conduct tests to determine whether the victims died of starvation. Police arrested Mr Mackenzie on 15 April after discovering the bodies of four people suspected of having starved themselves to death. Victor Kaudo of the Malindi Social Justice Centre told Citizen TV when we are in this forest and come to an area where we see a big and tall cross, we know that means more than five people are buried there. The preacher allegedly named three villages Nazareth, Bethlehem and Judea and baptised followers in ponds before telling them to fast, The Standard reports. Kenya is a religious country and there have been previous cases of people being lured into dangerous, unregulated churches or cults. Source: BBC -Agencies",

        "content": "Meghan, the wife of Britains Prince Harry, criticised the British media on Saturday over reports that letters exchanged with King Charles played a part behind her decision not to attend his coronation, her latest confrontation with the press. The Daily Telegraph reported Meghan had written to the now king to express her concerns about unconscious bias in the royal family. It said the letter was sent following her 2021 comments in an interview with Oprah Winfrey that the family had raised concerns about how dark her sons skin would be. It reported the Duchess of Sussex did not feel she had received a satisfactory response to her concerns. The Duchess of Sussex is going about her life in the present, not thinking about correspondence from two years ago related to conversations from four years ago, a spokesperson for Meghan said. Any suggestion otherwise is false and frankly ridiculous. We encourage tabloid media and various royal correspondents to stop the exhausting circus that they alone are creating. Prince Harry will attend the coronation next month without Meghan, who will remain in California with the couples two young children. Their eldest, Archie, turns four on the same day. Harry and Meghan stepped down from royal duties in March 2020, saying they wanted to make new lives in the United States away from media harassment. Source - Reuters -Agencies",

        "content": "Indian police have arrested Sikh separatist Amritpal Singh after searching for him for more than a month, a state police official said on Sunday, a move against the revival of an independent homeland in the state of Punjab bordering Pakistan. The rise of Singh, a preacher in the northwestern state of Punjab where Sikhs are in the majority, has revived talk of an independent Sikh homeland and stoked fears of a return to violence that killed tens of thousands of people in the 1980s and early 1990s during a Sikh insurgency. Amritpal Singh has been arrested from the Rode village in Moga district, Punjab on the basis of specific intelligence, Sukhchain Singh Gill, a top official of the Punjab police told reporters. The arrest of Amritpal Singh, 30 -- who leads a group called Waris Punjab De (the heirs of Punjab)-- comes after the self-styled preacher and hundreds of his supporters stormed a police station with swords and firearms, demanding the release of one of his aides. Police have accused Singh and his supporters of attempted murder, obstruction of law enforcement, and creating disharmony, and said he had been on the run since mid-March. He was arrested in the village gurudwara, a Sikh temple, under the National Security Act, which allows for those deemed a threat to national security to be detained without charge for up to a year, the police official said. Gill said he would be moved to Dibrugarh, in the state of Assam, where some of his associates are already in jail. Source - Reuters -Agencies",

The prisons media spokesperson, Additional Commissioner General of Prisons Chandana Ekanayake, in a press release, said statements were obtained from the three officials in question pertaining to a video received by the prisons intelligence unit. Thereby, the service of the three prison officials was suspended, pending disciplinary action. The three prison officials were in charge of three 16-year-olds who were arrested for assaulting a man to death using helmets on the eve of February 14 in Galmatta, Welipenna. The 34-year-old victim, Ranga Viraj, was a father of one employed at a private company. He was assaulted to death by the three teens after he advised them against riding motorcycles at a high speed without wearing helmets. One of the three youths was arrested by the Welipenna Police later on February 14 while the other two were taken into custody the following day. The trio was subsequently referred to the child detention centre in Makola after being produced before the Mathugama Magistrates Court. On April 18, they were escorted out of the detention centre to the Magistrates Court for the ongoing legal matter. A video showing the relatives of the three accused stopping the vehicle, which was transporting the trio back to the detention facility, and loading some items into the vehicle was circulated in media earlier. The Prisons Department said its intelligence unit has initiated an extensive investigation into the matter after a complaint was filed by the family of the murder victim. The prisons media spokesperson said strict disciplinary action would be sought against the three officials who were in charge of the three teens, following the conclusion of the probe. The brother of the deceased said they intend to present submissions in this regard, via their lawyer, to the magistrate at the hearing of the case.",

        "date": "April 23, 2023 08:50 pm",
        "content": "Sri Lanka President Ranil Wickermesinghe has said that in the backdrop of India becoming the worlds most populated country while having industrialisation which is on fast track, Sri Lanka can reap the benefits, and plan to become an air and sea hub in the region. Addressing the 30-year development plan of the Colombo North Port workshop here, Wickremesinghe highlighted the importance of probing the development in India to find the connectivity that is going to take place between India and Sri Lanka and pointed out the opportunities that Indias southern neighbour would receive. By 2050, India will be the most populous country in the world. From 1.4 billion, it will be up to 1.7 billion people. The industrialisation of India is happening fast, especially in some areas. You find Gujarat, Maharashtra and other one in southern India, especially in Tamil Nadu, Wickremesinghe said Friday. But this is the beginning. From there it should spread to other areas. So, industrialisation manufacturing is now taking place in India. It still has not reached the level that China reached somewhere in 2010. It still has to go there. So, if at all at some stage, it will be that the progress will be not arithmetic but geometrical progression, Wickremesinghe stated. So, we will have the development in India. Then what is the connectivity thats going to take place between India and Sri Lanka. Our closest point is in the north. Are we going to have a role in the role of ferries? Are we going to have more permanent structures? These are issues that we have to resolve and that will also determine the viability of our ports, especially of the port of Colombo. So in looking at the port theres only two issues which came to my mind. Firstly, it is the environment, especially the impact on fishing that we have to take seriously. Because before you start building you have to get the support of the people in the area, the Sri Lanka President said. Wickremesinghe said that in its journey to make Sri Lanka a hub and a developed country within the next 25 years, the island nation has to look at the development in India and the region including Bangladesh, Iran and the entire Makran coast. With the Trincomalee Port, we are discussing with India on the development of the Trincomalee Port on the basis that in the next 25 years there will be vast development in the Bay of Bengal, both on the Indian side, the Bangladeshi side, Malaysia and even Myanmar. So we have to look at the Trincomalee Port and also its capacity to be a point for cruise tourism in the Bay of Bengal. He said the island nation with over 22 million has to think of the future, what we will do in the next 25 years, how we are going ahead to make this a developed country. We have to look at the developments in India, in Bangladesh, in Iran, and total, in assessing the role that Sri Lanka has to play as a hub, that is important. We have to remember one thing only that what is going to take place in India, whats the development in Pakistan and whats the development going to be in Iran. Those three will decide the capacity, the number of TUs that we can have, the number of containers, the units we have would depend on that. As it is now, people have a very bright forecast for India, and thats possible if it can be achieved, Ranil Wickremesinghe said. Referring to a report on the feasibility of the north port, Wickremeisnghe also said though Pakistan is going through a financial crisis now like Sri Lanka, the country has a great capacity for development considering its population. If Iran goes ahead with the Chabahar Port which will join up to Central Asia and Russia, then Makran coast itself is something to look at. So these are all areas we have to think of development, President Wickremesinghe who took over Sri Lanka while it was going through the worst ever post-independent economic crisis said. He also stressed that to become the hub of the Indian Ocean, Sri Lanka should adjust with the logistic and transport changes taking place with East to West railways in Africa undertaken by China. Remember that the Chinese are undertaking east to west Railways in Africa together with the African nations. One which will go from Kenya all the way to West African coast and another which will most probably go through Congo. So the whole logistics and transport in the region will change and we have to take that into account and make whatever adjustments we do now to ensure that Sri Lanka becomes the hub of the Indian Ocean. We can do it, we should do it, and we did that over a thousand years ago. I am sure we make up our mind, go ahead, Wickremesinghe reiterated. Source - IANS -Agencies",

        "content": "Kenyan police have now exhumed the bodies of 47 people thought to be followers of a Christian cult who believed they would go to heaven if they starved themselves to death. Police near the coastal town of Malindi started exhuming bodies on Friday from the Shakahola forest. In total, 47 people have died at the Shakahola forest, detective Charles Kamau told Reuters on Sunday. The exhumations were still ongoing, Kamau said. Earlier this month, police rescued 15 members of the group -- worshippers at the Good News International Church -- who they said had been told to starve themselves to death. Four of them died before they reached hospital, police said. The leader of the church, Paul Mackenzie, was arrested following a tip-off that suggested the existence of shallow graves belonging to at least 31 of Mackenzies followers. Local media, citing police sources, reported that Mackenzie has refused to eat or drink while in police custody. Interior Minister Kithure Kindiki said the entire 800 acre forest had been sealed off and declared a scene of crime. This horrendous blight on our conscience must lead not only to the most severe punishment of the perpetrator(s) of the atrocity on so many innocent souls, but tighter regulation (including self-regulation) of every church, mosque, temple or synagogue going forward, he said.

The quake struck near the Kermadec Islands about 900 km northeast of New Zealands North Island at a depth of 49 km, according to the US Geological Survey. The Pacific Tsunami Warning Centre said the quake posed no threat to Hawaii and the wider Pacific. A localised potential for a tsunami passed without any confirmed impact. New Zealands National Emergency Management Agency said it was assessing whether the quake could affect New Zealand but gave its standard advice for people to move away from coastal areas if they felt a long or strong quake. The Kermadec Islands are uninhabited except for Raoul Island where New Zealand scientists sometimes stay over to carry out meteorological observations or weed control work. The islands are the site of frequent large earthquakes. They were geologically formed from a ridge that rose from the ongoing collision between the Pacific and Australian tectonic plates.

The Ministry of Health had taken steps to suspend surgeries at National Eye Hospital recently, due to a case of complications observed in several patients after surgery at the hospital. The use of Prednisolone, an eye drop imported from India, was found to have caused the complications. Media Committee member of the Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA), Dr. Prasad Colombage stated that thereby, the use of Prednisolone was withdrawn with immediate effect, as per a directive issued by the Ministry of Health and that the surgeries will be resumed from today, as usual. Surgery had to be stopped at the National Eye Hospital in the last few days due to the entry of germs. After sterilizing the germ, surgeries will be resumed back today. Necessary measures have been taken to completely remove the relevant type of medicine that caused complications and to use another medicine instead of it, so that the surgery can be performed very safely, he added. Dr. Colombage further mentioned that it is now possible to provide the necessary services from the National Eye Hospital to the people.",

None of the gunshot wounds were life-threatening, the Jasper County Sheriffs Office said in a statement that offered few other details about the shooting at a residence in Jasper, a town of about 7,200 people some 134 miles (215 km) northeast of Houston. The victims were taken to two hospitals, the sheriffs office said, without reporting on the number of shooters. This investigation is ongoing and people of interest are being questioned, the statement said. The victims ranged in age from 15 to 19, KBMT-KJAC television news reported.

The ongoing socio-economic crisis has had serious impacts on the agricultural sector in Sri Lanka. The rising energy costs and evolving climate change impacts have further exacerbated due to the situation. In response, the Government of Japan through the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in Sri Lanka, will provide approximately LKR 1,175 million (approx. USD 3.8 million) to support vulnerable smallholder farming families in the Dry Zone districts, namely North-Central, North-Western and Eastern Provinces, with a focus on womens economic empowerment and adoption of green agricultural technologies. Funded by the Japanese Supplementary Budget (JSB) and working together with the Government of Sri Lanka and relevant stakeholders, the intervention aims to achieve its objectives through two projects; the first focusing on diversifying livelihoods and introduce entrepreneurship programmes, targeting women-led MSMEs. The second aims to strengthen energy and food security, through the revival of the rural agricultural economy by providing access to innovative markets, value and supply chain improvements along with the adoption of modern, green agricultural technologies which will increase productivity and efficiency. A total of 58,000 women and youth will directly benefit from these projects, while indirectly impacting over 132,000 vulnerable community members from the North-Central, North-Western and Eastern Provinces of Sri Lanka. To mark the beginning of these projects and to recognize the Government of Japans support to the interventions, a launch event was held today with the participation of Prime Minister Dinesh Gunawardena, Mizukoshi Hideaki, Ambassador of Japan to Sri Lanka, Ms. Azusa Kubota, Resident Representative, UNDP Sri Lanka, Mr. Tetsuya Yamada, Chief Representative of JICA in Sri Lanka, Mahinda Amaraweera, Minister of Agriculture, Wildlife and Forest Resources Conservation, Kanchana Wijesekera, Minister of Power and Energy, senior government officials and development partners. Gracing the occasion, Prime Minister stated, Government of Sri Lanka appreciates the continuous support extended by the Government of Japan and the United Nations Development Programme towards countrys efforts to recover from the socioeconomic crisis. We believe this is a significant step towards creating a food and energy secure Sri Lanka, both vital sectors to the fabric of the countrys economy. Highlighting Japans commitment to the people of Sri Lanka in crisis recovery efforts, Ambassador Mizukoshi, Ambassador of Japan to Sri Lanka stated, Japan has been working together with the Government of Sri Lanka and relevant UN agencies for economic and social empowerment of women in Sri Lanka, including the formulation of National Action Plan for Women, Peace and Security. These new projects will provide for practical means to uplift lives of vulnerable communities. Especially, we recognize the special needs of women-headed household in conflict-affected areas. It is a great opportunity to create positive synergy with UNDPs expertise and JICAs technical assistance for supporting livelihood and vulnerable communities. Commenting on the role of UNDP in bringing together stakeholders and facilitating such processes in times of need, Ms. Azusa Kubota, Resident Representative, UNDP in Sri Lanka stated, these are times when multiple-solutions through multiple-partnerships are required because we are faced with compounding and complex challenges. I am grateful for the commitments demonstrated by a wide range of actors present today. We must join hands to address the needs of the most vulnerable and affected segments of the society  particularly women-headed households. And investing in them will have visible, long-term benefits for the families and communities",

        "date": "April 24, 2023 11:06 pm",
        "content": "Thailand continues to look for ways to bring home Sak Surin, an elephant gifted to Sri Lanka in 2001 for medical treatment, following concerns from animal rights groups about the alleged mistreatment of the animal. Kanchana Patarachoke, the Thai foreign ministrys spokeswoman, said in a statement that the government has asked Sri Lanka to return Sak Surin to Thailand for treatment, which has been provided since February of this year. The Natural Resources and Environment Ministry is in the process of confirming budget allocation to arrange for the proper mode of transport back to Thailand for Sak Surin to receive further treatment. Sak Surin now awaits its return to Thailand, she said in a statement. Sak Surin is one of three elephants that were gifted by Thailand to Sri Lanka as a goodwill ambassador for Thailand. However, last year, animal rights groups have lodged complaints alleging mistreatment, resulting in a serious deterioration in its health condition. Kanchana said the Thai Foreign Ministry has been closely monitoring the well-being and condition of Sak Surin and has been liaising closely with the Natural Resources and Environment Ministry as well as the Royal Thai Embassy in Colombo. Sak Surin had been transferred to Dehiwala Zoological Garden in Sri Lanka for further treatment since November 2022. Since then, the elephants health has improved, although Sak Surin is still unable to bend his left front leg, she said. Kanchana said the image of Sak Surin which has circulated on social media is an old picture. A veterinarian and a Thai mahout have been monitoring Sak Surins condition closely and have been providing treatment to the elephant, she said. Local media has reported that Sak Surins return to Thailand has faced obstacles. Varawut Silpa-archa, the minister of the environment and natural resources, is said to have looked at other methods of repatriation, such as transport by C-130 and by ship. Due to the elephants size and the severity of its wounds, these ideas were deemed unsuitable.  Bernama Source: Bernama --Agencies",

The country has been gripped by a deep financial crisis caused by economic mismanagement and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which left the island nation severely short of dollars for essential imports and its people struggling with soaring costs of living. The International Monetary Fund approved in March a nearly 3 billion bailout loan for Colombo, but as it will take time for the country to recover, Sri Lankan missions abroad have been working to attract more foreign investors to help put the battered economy back on track. Investment from Saudi Arabia has been identified as a key part of ongoing recovery efforts in Sri Lanka, said Falah Alhabshi Mowlana, Sri Lankas consul general in Jeddah. Saudi investment is very important to Sri Lanka, Mowlana told Arab News in an interview in Colombo over the weekend. This is the country that helped Egypt, Pakistan, etc during their economic depression. In this current situation, if Sri Lanka can attract Saudi investments it would play a huge role in the stability of the Sri Lankan economy. The Board of Investment of Sri Lanka has been working with the countrys foreign missions to attract more foreign investors, Mowlana said, adding that the tourism and energy sectors are likely the most potential for Saudi investment. (The) tourism sector is one of the best sectors that can attract Saudi investment  If the opportunities in Sri Lanka in this sector can be presented in a proper way to Saudi nationals that will immensely impact Foreign Direct Investment to Sri Lanka. When Sri Lanka declared 2022 the Visit Sri Lanka Year to prioritize the tourism industry, it also realigned its strategies and identified the Middle East among its top potential markets, pinning hopes especially on Saudi Arabia. After holding various tourism promotions last year, Mowlana said Sri Lankan officials have continued discussions with leading tour operators in Jeddah. The growth of the electric vehicle industry in Saudi Arabia can also offer opportunities for Sri Lanka, the envoy said. They are in the position of expanding their production worldwide, including (to) Sri Lanka. We can say some examples such as ACWA power and Lucid Motors, he said, referring to the Saudi energy giant and the electric carmaker backed by the Kingdoms Public Investment Fund. Sri Lankan officials have been working on boosting ties with Saudi Arabia for the past year, with Foreign Minister Ali Sabry having visited the Kingdom earlier in January to further relations in connectivity, investment, and employment opportunities. Last August, Environment Minister Naseer Ahamed also visited Riyadh as a special envoy of President Ranil Wickremesinghe, where his meetings focused on increasing energy cooperation.

        "date": "April 24, 2023 11:26 pm",
        "content": "Sri Lanka will gift Pakistan two elephants following the tragic death of an African mammoth, Noor Jehan, at Karachi Zoo, Pakistani media reported. The Honorary Consul General of Sri Lanka, Yasin Joyia, confirmed the news on Sunday, revealing that both elephants will be female, with one going to the Karachi Zoo and the other to Lahore. Joyia expressed his grief over the death of Noor Jehan, who passed away due to prolonged health issues, which reportedly worsened due to a lack of care at the zoo. He also mentioned that there are currently no elephants in Lahore Zoo after the passing of Suzi in May 2017, who was the only large mammal there. The Sri Lankan envoy assured that the names of the elephants would be given by the government back home, and their arrival would be announced shortly. This news has been well received by animal lovers in Pakistan, as the outcry against the caging of animals in zoos has been ongoing for quite some time. The heartbreaking story of Noor Jehans plight has put a spotlight on the lack of care and attention given to animals in captivity, sparking outrage among animal rights activists in Pakistan and abroad. Many have taken to social media to express their concern and sadness over the incident, with calls for the zoo to be shut down. It remains to be seen how the two elephants will fare in their new home, but it is hoped that their arrival will help improve conditions for animals in zoos across the country.

        "content": "A magnitude 7.3 earthquake has struck west of Indonesias Sumatra Island, triggering a tsunami warning which has now been lifted. The tsunami warning which was in place for around two hours, asked local authorities to immediately instruct residents of the affected area to move away from shores, but it has since been lifted. Meanwhile Sri Lankas Department of Meteorology announced there is no tsunami threat to Sri Lanka at present with the effect of above earthquake and that therefore, the coastal areas of Sri Lanka are declared safe. Public is further informed that this message is announced in consultation with relevant national and international agencies, the National Tsunami Early Warning Center said. The European-Mediterranean Seismological Centre earlier pegged the quake at 6.9 magnitude. The quake, at a depth of 84km, hit on Tuesday at about 3am local time. A number of aftershocks were detected later, and one registered 5 magnitude, BMKG data showed. Indonesias disaster mitigation agency said authorities were collecting data from the islands nearest the epicentre off the western shore of Sumatra, spokesperson Abdul Muhari said. In Padang, the capital of West Sumatra, the quake was felt strongly, and some people moved away from the beaches, said Abdul, who was in Padang. People left their homes. Some were panicking but under control. Currently some of them are evacuating away from the sea, he said, adding he had seen no damage so far. Local news footage showed some Padang residents evacuating by motorbike and foot to higher ground. Some carried backpacks while others huddled together under an umbrella against the rain. On the Siberut island, people had already been evacuated. They have been told to stay at the evacuation area until tsunami warning is lifted, Noviandri, a local official told TvOne. Indonesia suffers frequent earthquakes because it straddles the so-called Pacific Ring of Fire, a seismically active zone where different plates of the earths crust meet. - With inputs from Reuters --Agencies",

Therefore, the Cabinet of Ministers has granted approval for the relevant proposal since there is a need to prepare a detailed tourism development plan in order to create a necessary environment for the growth of the tourism industry in the area.",
