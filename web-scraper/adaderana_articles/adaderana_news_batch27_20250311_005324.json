        "title": "Jaishankar underlines extended neighbourhood: India did more for Sri Lanka than IMF",
        "date": "May 28, 2023 10:36 am",
        "content": "India has done more for Sri Lanka than the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Union Minister for External Affairs Dr S Jaishankar stressed on Saturday. The Modi government, he underlined, is working on developing an extended neighbourhood that involves islands in the Indian Ocean, Gulf countries and nations in South-East Asia. What we are also trying to do today is for a bigger, influential and ambitious India. We are trying to expand what should be our neighbourhood. We look at what this extended neighbourhood should be. It could be islands in the Indian Ocean, nations in South-East Asia and Central Asia, or Gulf countries. The relationship with the UAE and Saudi Arabia has undergone an enormous transformation. From what was a traditionally much more constricted view of our neighbourhood, we have undertaken something much more ambitious, said Jaishankar during a talk on Modis India: A Rising Power at Anant National University in the city. Pointing out how the world has become more uncertain, volatile and turbulent, Jaishankar underlined it was time to use the complex global landscape for the betterment and growth of India. The pandemic and the Ukraine-Russia conflict has helped to build resilient and reliable supply chains, domestic capacities and trusted relationships, he highlighted. A Rajya Sabha MP from Gujarat, Jaishankar also spoke about the linkages and perception India has developed in the last nine years under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. If you are the biggest in your neighbourhood, then it is in our interest that our other neighbours have a share in our prosperity, happiness and are linked to us. That will happen if we are generous and have a non-reciprocal way of engagement. Many of our neighbours like Bangladesh or Nepal and Bhutan are today linked with us through roads, railways, and waterways. We have electricity grid connections; there are fuel supplies. In many ways, they benefit from the scale and economy of India, Jaishankar said while addressing an audience largely composed of students and faculty members from the private university. The linkages and perception today of India in the neighbourhood has changed. Nothing illustrated that more dramatically than what happened to Sri Lanka. Last year, when they went through a very deep economic crisis, we stepped forward in a way we ourselves have never done before. What we have done for Sri Lanka is bigger than what the IMF has done for Sri Lanka. If any of you have visited Sri Lanka recently, then you will note the popular perception that has accrued from this action, he added. Speaking about Indias relationship with China, the Union minister said, The challenge from China is complicated. But in the last three years, it has been particularly visible in the border areas. There are clearly responses that are required and those responses have been undertaken by the government and a lot of it is to ensure that no attempt is made to unilaterally change the status quo in the border areas. We will ensure peace and tranquillity. It is the basis of our relationship. If peace is disturbed, it cannot be that the relationship remains unaffected. Both India and China, he said, will have to find some kind of equilibrium where there is mutual respect, sensitivity and recognition. Today, if we see that respect, sensitivity and recognition, we can have a better relationship with China. But if we do not, then we have to stand up for our rights. We need to be firm in asserting our positions. That is unfortunately the current situation, he added. Modis India is different from its predecessors. It is different in its outlook, he said while speaking about the decisive mandate and vision the Prime Minister has secured. Modis India is a return to a political dispensation that has a majority in Parliament, Jaishankar emphasised, pointing out that such a majority did not exist from 1989 to 2014.

        "title": "Modi opponents boycott opening of new Indian Parliament; PM says it breaks with colonial past",
        "date": "May 28, 2023 03:20 pm",
        "content": "Indias major opposition parties on Sunday boycotted the inauguration of a new Parliament building by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in a rare show of unity against his Hindu nationalist ruling party, which has ruled for nine years and is seeking a third term in next years elections. Modi inaugurated the new Parliament in the capital of New Delhi by offering prayers as Hindu priests chanted religious hymns. Opposition parties criticized the event saying Modi had sidelined President Droupadi Murmu, who has only ceremonial powers but is the head of state and highest constitutional authority. Shortly after the inauguration, a visibly beaming Modi entered Parliament amid a rousing applause by his party lawmakers who chanted Modi, Modi. He delivered an almost 40-minute speech in which he hailed Indias parliamentary democracy and said the country had left behind its colonial past, referring to the old Parliament building that was built by the British when they ruled India. India is the mother of democracy, Modi said, as lawmakers thumped their desks. Several years of foreign rule stole our pride from us. Today, India has left behind that colonial mindset. The opposition Congress party leader Rahul Gandhi tweeted: Parliament is the voice of the people. The Prime Minister is considering the inauguration of the Parliament House as a coronation. At least 19 opposition parties skipped the event, which coincided with the birth anniversary of a Hindu nationalist ideologue. Opposition parties said in a statement Wednesday that Modis decision to inaugurate the building was a grave insult to Indias democracy, because the government had disqualified, suspended and muted opposition lawmakers while passing controversial legislation with little debate. When the soul of democracy has been sucked out from the parliament, we find no value in a new building, the parties said. Indias powerful Home Minister Amit Shah said the opposition had politicized the event. Other leaders from Modis party said the boycott was an insult to the prime minister. The new triangular-shaped building  built at an estimated cost of 120 million  is part of a 2.8 billion revamp of British-era offices and residences in central New Delhi that will also include blocks of buildings to house government ministries and departments, and Modis new private residence. The entire project, called the Central Vista, is spread over 3.2 kilometers (1.9 miles). The project was announced in 2019, and Modi laid the foundation in December 2020. The plan has drawn intense criticism from opposition politicians, architects and heritage experts, many of whom called it environmentally irresponsible, a threat to cultural heritage and too expensive. Outrage grew in 2021, when at least 12 opposition parties questioned the projects timing, saying it was built as the country faced a devastating surge in coronavirus cases. They branded the revamp as Modis vanity project and said its construction was prioritized over the loss of lives and livelihoods during the pandemic. A year earlier, a group of 60 former civil servants wrote an open letter to Modi to highlight the architectural value of the old Parliament and said the new plan would irrevocably destroy the areas cultural heritage. Modis government has said the overhaul was necessary because the older building was showing signs of distress and overutilization and that the new design combines the countrys heritage and traditions. The new building sits just across from Indias old Parliament, a circular structure designed by British architects in the early 20th century. The new four-story building has a total of 1,272 seats in two chambers, almost 500 more than the previous one. The old Parliament will be converted into a museum. During the televised ceremony Sunday, Modi prostrated himself before a royal golden scepter that his Bharatiya Janata Party says symbolized the transfer of power when it was gifted to the countrys first prime minister on the eve of Indias independence from Britain in 1947. Dozens of Hindu priests followed Modi inside Parliament, where he installed the scepter near the chair of the speaker. Modis critics and opposition leaders have questioned the scepters historicity and said the emblem is appropriate for a monarchy, not a democracy. Last year, Modi inaugurated a refurbished colonial-era avenue in the heart of New Delhi that is used for ceremonial military parades. The boulevard was earlier called Rajpath, or Kingsway, but Modis party changed it to Kartavya Path, or Road to Duty, arguing the old name was a symbol of slavery that had been erased forever. The controversy over the new legislative building comes just months after opposition leaders protested Gandhis disqualification from Parliament in a defamation case over remarks he made about Modis surname. Barely a mile away from the ceremony, a heavy police presence overpowered about 100 protesting Indian wrestlers and their supporters. They accuse their federation president of sexual misconduct and had planned to march to the new Parliament building. Some of the protesters scuffled with police and were taken away in a bus. Wrestling Federation of India President Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh, who has denied the accusations, is a powerful lawmaker from Modis party. Source - The Associated Press -Agencies",

The stand-up comedian in question, identified as Nathasha Edirisooriya and the individual who had posted the relevant video online later publicly apologised for the statements made. Despite their apology, however, several parties severely criticised the insults made during Nathashas segment, adding that she had used derogatory language.

State TV showed the C919 rising into the skies above Shanghai, heading to the capital Beijing early on Sunday. It was built by the Commercial Aviation Corporation of China (Comac) in the hope of breaking the dominance of Airbus and Boeings single-aisle jets. But the 164-seater still relies heavily on Western components, including engines and avionics. The Shanghai-Beijing leg of the journey, with more than 130 passengers on board, was completed in just under three hours. Im really confident in our country, said passenger Liu Peng. He told Reuters news agency C919 will definitely get better and better. Im feeling very emotional, said 21-year-old student and flight enthusiast LV Boyuan. He spoke to Reuters at Shanghai airport before he boarded a normal flight to Chengdu, from where he planned to take a return C919 flight the day after. State-backed China Eastern Airline has ordered five of the planes. Comac - which plans to produce 150 planes annually in five years time - says it has already secured more than 1,200 orders for the C919. Some experts, however, say that most of these orders are believed to be letters of intent from domestic customers. President Xi Jinping, who sat in the cockpit of a mock-up C919 a few years ago, has described the project as one of Chinas most innovative achievements. The C919 made its first test flight in 2017 and has undergone several similar flights since. Source - BBC -Agencies",

Lumpy skin disease, a viral disease of cattle characterised by fever, nodules on the skin, mucous membranes and internal organs, emaciation, enlarged lymph nodes, oedema of the skin, and sometimes death, has now been spread to 34 out of the 46 Veterinary Officer Divisions in the North Western Province. Director of the Department of Animal Production and Health in North Western Province, J. A. S. Perera emphasized that taking the situation into account, this decision was arrived at to control the spread of the disease. Mr. Perera, who pointed out that this disease was migrated through India to Jaffna in 2019 and then to the North Western Province through the North Central Province, also mentioned that this situation may have a severe impact on the milk production within the Province, since the milk production of cows will significantly decrease after the animals are infected with this disease. He also highlighted that the death rate of cattle as a result of this disease is very low, and if the disease is properly managed and the animals are given the necessary treatment on time, it is possible to recover the animals in a period of three weeks. Dr. Perera also informed people to refrain from eating beef until this disease is brought under control.",

        "content": "The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has approved a 350 million special policy-based loan to provide budget support to Sri Lanka for economic stabilization today (29). In a statement, the ADB said the program is part of a broader package of financial assistance anchored by the International Monetary Funds Extended Fund Facility for the country, which aims to stabilize the economy and lay the foundation for economic recovery and sustained growth. Sri Lanka is facing a severe and unprecedented economic crisis. High inflation has eroded purchasing power, livelihoods have been affected, and past development gains have been reversed, it added. ADB is concerned about the deep crisis in the country and its impact on the people of Sri Lanka, especially the poor and the vulnerable, particularly women, said ADB President Masatsugu Asakawa. ADB is committed to standing with Sri Lanka as it addresses its present challenges and strides toward economic stabilization, sustainable recovery, and inclusive growth. Sri Lanka has embarked on bold reforms to address the causes of both internal and external imbalances and return to a sustainable debt trajectory. The country faces a long road to recovery and must remain steadfast in the implementation of necessary reforms, which include enhancing tax revenue collection, strengthening public financial management, improving the performance of state-owned enterprises, ensuring autonomy and independence of the central bank, safeguarding financial sector stability, and bolstering governance frameworks, according to the ADB. As these measures are implemented, it is essential to ensure that adequate social protection is provided. Implementing governance reforms and anticorruption measures will be critical, it said. Transparency and open communication will be crucial in building agreement around the reforms. ADB will proactively engage with the government, other stakeholders, and development partners to help address structural impediments and plan future support. ADB has supported Sri Lankas response throughout the crisis, the ADB mentioned, adding that in 2022, in close coordination with development partners, ADB provided emergency assistance to support basic services and sustain livelihoods. ADB repurposed 334 million of existing loans as an emergency response to support the import of essential items such as fertilizer, medicines, chemicals for water treatment, working capital for small and medium-sized enterprises, and cash transfers to the poorest and vulnerable. Trade finance lines through ADB Trade and Supply Chain Finance Program supported the import of essential items during the crisis. ADB is committed to achieving a prosperous, inclusive, resilient, and sustainable Asia and the Pacific, while sustaining its efforts to eradicate extreme poverty. Established in 1966, it is owned by 68 members49 from the region, it added.",

This was mentioned at the Parliamentary Caucus for Children which convened in Parliament recently, the Communications Department of Parliament reported today. The Ministry of Women, Child Affairs and Social Empowerment and its affiliates such as the Department of Probation and Child Care Services, the National Child Protection Authority and the Ministry of Mass Media and the institutions operating under it and the Sri Lanka Rupavahini Corporation, Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation, Independent Television Network Ltd, Lake House and Government Information Department were also called before the caucus. It was pointed out by the Members of Parliament that the exposure of the identities of children through the media, especially in cases of child molestation and child abuse, has a great impact on the lives of the children concerned. Officials of the state media indicated that their agencies follow a standard when disseminating news related to children. Accordingly, the Caucus membership agreed that all media organizations should be called for the next meeting to discuss this further. Apart from the said, there was a long discussion about the measures that can be taken to improve the condition of children in orphanages in Sri Lanka, the statement said. Maintenance of relevant institutions even according to minimum standards, shortage of child care staff, inadequate hygiene in these places, provision of adequate psychosocial treatment to children, socialization process of children in orphanages when they reach the age of 18, children in orphanages There was a long discussion about the measures to be taken for safety and proper supervision of childrens homes. The officials pointed out that the Geneva Committee on Childrens Rights has given recommendations regarding orphanages in Sri Lanka and there are many issues such as shortage of trained staff, allocation of adequate provision for the Department of Child Care Services etc. The importance of providing vocational training to children in orphanages was discussed at length, and the need for a suitable program to socialize children over 18 years of age and the importance of creating an environment for them to engage in self-employment was also emphasized. In addition to that, introducing a foster parent system, placing children in the care of relatives, local adoptions, etc. were also discussed in the forum as alternative care proposals for children.

        "title": "Food insecurity improved in Sri Lanka but prevails within specific regions  FAO and WFP",
        "date": "May 29, 2023 03:41 pm",
        "content": "Food security in Sri Lanka is improving across all provinces, according to the Crop and Food Security Assessment Mission (CFSAM) report jointly carried out in FebruaryMarch 2023 by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP). The report estimates 3.9 million people or 17 percent of the population is in moderate acute food insecurity which is nearly a 40 percent decrease from JuneJuly last year. Nearly 10,000 people are severely acute food-insecure, down from 66,000 people last year. The improvement in food security stems from better food consumption, which could be attributed to reduced food prices and improved incomes among farming communities during the harvesting period when the mission was carried out. Despite this positive trend, food insecurity remains high in certain districts, especially Kilinochchi, Nuwara Eliya, Mannar, Batticaloa, Vavuniya, and Jaffna. The highest level of acute food insecurity was found within the tea plantation communities in the Estate sector and among daily wage labourers and households who rely on social assistance programmes, such as Samurdhi, as their main source of income, the report said. Production of cereal, including rice and maize, across the two main cropping seasons in 202223 is forecast at 4.1 million tonnes, 14 percent below the past five-year average, mainly due to poor plant nutrition caused by an inadequate supply of fertilizer and unaffordability of essential material inputs. However, essential fertilizers distributed to smallholder farmers by the Government, facilitated by funds received from multilateral and bilateral donor agencies, has significantly impacted production, marking an improvement in the yield with productivity in the recently harvested 202223 Maha season, 12 higher than the 2022 Yala season. Representative of FAO to Sri Lanka and the Maldives, Mr. Vimlendra Sharan speaking on CFSAM Report findings said, The Crop and Food Security Assessment Mission (CFSAM) report is an eye-opener on the continuing vulnerabilities and challenges that exist within the food systems of Sri Lanka. This report and its findings will no doubt serve as a guiding light for policymakers and stakeholders to collectively work towards ensuring food security, strengthening agricultural resilience and mitigating risks faced by farmers and rural communities who have been disproportionately impacted by the economic crisis. FAO remains committed to supporting Sri Lanka in their efforts towards achieving sustainable food systems, food security and zero hunger. After many months of challenges, we are finally witnessing an improvement to the countrys food security, said Abdur Rahim Siddiqui, WFP Sri Lankas Representative and Country Director. But there is more to be done. A high number of households -- more than 60 percent -- are adopting negative measures to put food on the table, including borrowing money and purchasing food on credit. WFP will extend its emergency operation, which commenced last year, to provide food rations and cash assistance to people identified as food insecure. Mission recommendations The joint FAOWFP Mission recommends providing immediate support to farmers, particularly by releasing available fertilizer stocks to enhance production and productivity in the ongoing Yala season and make urgent policy decisions to import fertilizers in time for the 202324 Maha cultivation season. The report also recommends any move for reducing or removing fertiliser subsidy to be in a gradual and phased manner, giving adequate time to the farming community to adapt. Other recommendations include the establishment of a Fertilizer Task Force to streamline fertilizer procurement and distributions as well as to strengthen adaptive research on climate smart agriculture and sustainable farming practices to improve fertiliser use efficiency. Further, to minimize the impact on the livestock and fisheries sectors, the mission recommends providing adequate support to increase fodder and feed crop production. Further recommendations include continuing food andor cash assistance to facilitate access to food among households most vulnerable to food insecurity. In the long-term, increased livelihood support to food-insecure households and resilience-building initiatives are also recommended to prevent them from compromising on productivity and their capacity to cope with future shocks.

        "date": "May 29, 2023 03:53 pm",
        "content": "China plans to land astronauts on the moon before 2030, which would be another advance in whats increasingly seen as a new space race. The U.S. aims to put astronauts back on the lunar surface by the end of 2025. Deputy Director of the Chinese Manned Space Agency Lin Xiqiang confirmed Chinas goal at a news conference Monday but gave no specific date. Lin also said China plans to expand its orbiting crewed space station with an additional module. A new three-person crew is scheduled to head to the Tiangong station on Tuesday aboard the Shenzhou 16 craft and will overlap briefly with the three astronauts already aboard. The fresh crew includes a civilian for the first time. All previous crew members have been in the Peoples Liberation Army, the military wing of the countrys ruling Communist Party. Gui Haichao, a professor at Beijings top aerospace research institute, will join mission commander Jing Haipeng and spacecraft engineer Zhu Yangzhu as the payload expert. China completed the Tiangong space station in November with the third of three modules, centered on the Tianhe living and command module. Chinas first manned space mission in 2003 made it the third country after the former Soviet Union and the U.S. to put a person into space. China built its own station after it was excluded from the International Space Station, largely due to U.S. objections over the Chinese space programs intimate ties to the PLA. Space is increasingly seen as a new area of competition between China and the United States  the worlds two largest economies and rivals for diplomatic and military influence. The astronauts NASA sends to the moon by the end of 2025 will aim for the south pole where permanently shadowed craters are believed to be packed with frozen water. Plans for permanent crewed bases on the moon are also being considered by both countries, raising questions about rights and interests on the lunar surface. U.S. law tightly restricts cooperation between the two countries space programs and while China says it welcomes foreign collaborations, those have thus far been limited to scientific research. In addition to their lunar programs, the U.S. and China have also landed rovers on Mars and Beijing plans to follow the U.S. in landing a spacecraft on an asteroid.

        "title": "Turkeys Erdogan triumphs in election test, extending 20-year rule",
        "date": "May 29, 2023 04:27 pm",
        "content": "President Tayyip Erdogan and supporters on Monday revelled in an election victory lengthening his rule into a third decade while Turkeys opposition, which once counted on winning, braced for difficult days against an increasingly autocratic government. His rival Kemal Kilicdaroglu said it was the most unfair election in years but did not dispute the outcome, which gave Erdogan a mandate to pursue policies that have polarised Turkey and strengthened its position as a regional military power. The election had been seen as Erdogans biggest political challenge, with the opposition confident of unseating him and reversing his policies after polls showed a cost-of-living crisis left him vulnerable. But he prevailed with 52.2 of the vote to Kilicdaroglus 47.8. It reinforced Erdogans image of invincibility in the deeply divided NATO-member country, whose foreign, economic and security policy he has redrawn. Pro-government newspapers, part of an overwhelmingly pro-Erdogan media landscape that buoyed his election campaign in the nation of 85 million people, cheered his victory. Its a good result because Tayyip Erdogan is a good leader, he knows what the people want. If people have been voting for him for 20 years, he must be a successful leader, said Altay Sahin, a construction worker in Istanbul. Addressing supporters in a victory speech, Erdogan declared democracy the winner. Now is the time to put the disputes and conflicts of the election period to one side and unite around our national goals, he said. But the prospect of five more years of Erdogan rule was a harsh blow to an opposition which accused him of undermining democracy as he amassed ever more power - a charge he denies. Kilicdaroglu had promised a new spring if he had won. I look at the people around me, who were supporting the opposition, and all of them are resentful, said Hulya Yildirim, a lawyer. We forgot about spring in this country, we have to make our own spring because the people seem to be happy with winter. The lira slipped to a record low of 20.08 against the dollar. It has lost 90 of its value in the last decade, buffeted by currency crisis and rampant inflation. Its most recent losses were driven by uncertainty about what an Erdogan win would mean for economic policy. Critics have blamed his unorthodox, low interest-rate economic blueprint that the opposition had pledged to reverse, for the currencys woes. Erdogan said inflation, which hit a 24-year peak of 85 last year before easing, is Turkeys most urgent issue. DIFFICULT DAYS Though he called for unity, Erdogan stuck to a major theme of his campaign in accusing Kilicdaroglu and the opposition of siding with terrorists, without providing evidence. Turkeys main pro-Kurdish party, parliaments third largest, was among the opposition parties opposed to Erdogan and is accused of links to Kurdish militants, which it denies. For the opposition, very difficult days are ahead, said Atilla Yesilada, analyst at GlobalSource Partners, forecasting more judicial moves against the Kurdish party and saying it was not clear whether the opposition alliance would remain intact. Kilicdaroglus defeat will probably be a cause for concern among Turkeys NATO allies that have been alarmed by Erdogans amicable relations with Russian President Vladimir Putin, who congratulated his dear friend on his victory. U.S. President Joe Biden wrote on Twitter: I look forward to continuing to work together as NATO allies on bilateral issues and shared global challenges. He and Erdogan were to speak by phone later on Monday, Erdogans office said. U.S. relations with Turkey have been impeded by Erdogans objection to Sweden joining NATO as well as Ankaras close relationship with Moscow, even as Russian forces wage a 15-month-old invasion of Ukraine, and differences over Syria. ECONOMIC WOES Erdogans victory extends his tenure as the longest-serving leader since Mustafa Kemal Ataturk established modern Turkey after the collapse of the Ottoman Empire a century ago - a politically potent anniversary to be marked in October. Erdogan, head of the Islamist-rooted AK Party, appealed to voters with nationalist and conservative rhetoric in a divisive campaign that deflected attention from Turkeys economic problems. Kilicdaroglu, who had promise to set Turkey on a more democratic and collaborative path, said the election outcome showed there was a will among many Turks to remove an authoritarian government, but all the means of the state were laid at the feet of one man. Erdogans performance wrong-footed opponents who thought voters would punish him over the states initially slow response to earthquakes in February, in which over 50,000 people died. But in the first round of voting on May 14, which included parliamentary elections, his AK Party emerged top in 10 of the 11 provinces hit by the earthquakes, helping it to secure a parliamentary majority along with its allies.

However, the Chinese national has accepted, before the Judicial Medical Officer that the injuries were self-inflicted. Later, Presidents Counsel Sanjeewa Jayawardene, who appeared on behalf of the petitioner, requested the court for permission to withdraw the relevant petition. The bench of judges comprising of Justices Nissanka Bandula Karunaratne and A. Marikkar, who granted permission for the withdrawal of the petition, also ordered the petition to be dismissed.

        "content": "In a recent discussion, President Ranil Wickremesinghe expressed his concerns about the obstacles faced by students when taking exams in unfamiliar environments. He emphasized the need for the Ministry of Education and the Examinations Department to prioritize the convenience and progress of students over their own convenience. Recognizing the difficulties faced by students, the President advised the education authorities to transform schools with a minimum of 75 qualified students into examination centres, provided that it doesnt disrupt on-going exam activities. He instructed officials to take prompt action in implementing this plan, the Presidents Media Division (PMD) reported. During the discussion, it was revealed that the 2023 GCE OL examination, which began today (29), would be conducted in 3,568 centres, accommodating a total of 472,553 students. The government has employed approximately 40,000 officials for the smooth execution of the exams. However, President Wickremesinghe received reports from concerned parents and students regarding the inconvenience caused by redirecting students from their own schools to other examination centres. The Ministry of Education and the Department of Examinations explained that they had made this decision due to the prevailing economic situation, aiming to limit the number of examination centres, the PMD said. Understanding the impact this has on students mental well-being, the President stressed the importance of informing schools and students about such changes at least one year in advance. He also emphasized the necessity of establishing a formal program to conduct all examinations related to childrens education without any delay. The President clarified that it is not the responsibility of the Examinations Department to provide reasons for not holding exams but rather the primary duty of the Ministry of Education and the Examination Department to create a conducive environment for students to take exams in familiar surroundings, it added. The discussion was attended by Senior Advisor to the President on National Security and Chief of Staff, Sagala Ratnayake, Secretary to the President, Saman Ekanayake, Secretary to the Ministry of Education, Nihal Ranasinghe, Commissioner of Examinations, Amit Jayasundara, and other officials, according to the PMD.",

        "content": "Amid the uncertainty over the venue, Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) has expressed interest to host the Asia Cup 2023 and said it is prepared to host the championship if Asian Cricket Council (ACC) decide to allot the tournament to the island nation. The development comes just days ahead of the ACC meeting, which will decide the fate of the six-nation tournament. The SLC is prepared to host the Asia Cup at short notice. The decision now is up to the ACC, a top SLC official said on Monday. According to a Cricbuzz report, BCCI is firm on its stance and continues to oppose the hybrid model proposed by the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) wherein the matches are hosted in Pakistan and UAE. It has been learnt that informal deliberations over the contentious event between the chiefs of different boards have led to a consensus that there should be only one venue for the event. Colombo or nothing, was how a BCCI source reacted to the talks and cited logistical inconvenience as the reason for its opposition. We will go with the BCCI, added the SLC official. As of now, its clear that there are no takers for PCBs proposal of a hybrid model and they are getting clearly isolated in the ACC. The SLC, Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) and Afghanistan Cricket Board (ACB), the heads of which are in India for the IPL 2023 final, are siding with the BCCI, the report further said. Apart from all three are Test playing members -- SLC, BCB, ACB -- of the ACC, the non-test members like Emirates Cricket Board (ECB) and Cricket Association of Nepal (CAN) also have their presence in Ahmedabad where informal discussions have taken place in the last few days. It will be interesting to see the position of the PCB and its head Najam Sethi, who had earlier said that Pakistan would not take part in the Asia Cup if it is not allowed to host a few games in his country.

        "date": "May 30, 2023 09:55 am",
        "content": "Police in the Indian capital, Delhi, have arrested a 20-year-old man for brutally stabbing and murdering a 16-year-old female friend in public. Footage of the assault shows the man repeatedly stabbing the girl and crushing her head with a huge stone. The video, which has gone viral and led to outrage in India, shows many people watching the assault or walking by. Police have romantically linked the couple and say they had quarrelled hours before the murder on Sunday. The girl was going to attend the birthday party of a friends son when she was attacked, senior police official Ravi Kumar Singh told news agency ANI. He identified the accused as Sahil and said he was arrested from near Bulandshahr district in the neighbouring state of Uttar Pradesh. Mr Singh added that the investigation was going on and that the police couldnt reveal more details at the moment. After the footage of the gruesome murder went viral, many took to social media to express anger and outrage. Hashtags such as Delhi murder and Delhi crime were trending on Twitter along with Shahbad Dairy, the name of the locality where the crime occurred. In a tweet, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal described the murder as very sad and unfortunate and said that criminals have become fearless, there is no fear of the police. The crime was captured on CCTV. Several people saw this, but did not pay heed. Delhi has become extremely unsafe for women and girls, news agency ANI quoted the Delhi Commission for Women chief Swati Maliwal as saying. The chairperson of the National Commission for Women Rekha Sharma said the crime showed the insensitivity of the people of Delhi. There were several people at the spot when the incident took place but no one took any action to help the girl. The case should be heard in a fast-track court and the verdict should come as early as possible, she said. This is not the first gruesome crime in India where bystanders have been called out for their apathy. In the past too, citizens have been criticised for watching or making videos instead of helping victims of crime. There was similar outrage and much introspection after the December 2012 gangrape - and the subsequent death - of a 23-year-old physiotherapy student on a bus in Delhi. Her male companion, who was also assaulted but survived, later recounted how they lay injured and bleeding - but no-one stopped to help them for 25 minutes. Source: BBC -Agencies",

        "date": "May 30, 2023 10:34 am",
        "content": "The Cabinet of Ministers has given the go-ahead to resume the Colombo Light Rail Transit (LRT) project, which was to be implemented with the support of the Japanese Government, but scrapped during the administration of former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa. Cabinet spokesperson Minister Bandula Gunawardena stated this while addressing the media briefing convened to announce Cabinet decisions this morning (May 30). The decision to resume the LRT project was taken prior to President Ranil Wickremesinghes official visit to Japan last week, in a bid to restore Sri Lankas credibility with the international community, Gunawardena explained. Japan has provided the crisis-hit Sri Lanka with some major assistance, however, terminating certain projects and proposals led to a dent in the bilateral relations between the two nations, the Cabinet spokesperson continued. He noted that President Wickremesinghes visit to Japan aimed at repairing this dent in the Sri Lanka-Japan bilateral relations. Before his departure for Tokyo, the President had secured the approval of the Cabinet of Ministers to resume the Colombo LRT project, according to the minister. Further, the Cabinet of Ministers gave the nod for a proposal suggesting that any agreement Sri Lanka signs with another country for an investment project or to seek foreign assistance should be tabled in the parliament and that the termination of such agreements should be done with the parliamentary approval.",

        "title": "Uganda enacts harsh anti-LGBTQ law including death penalty",
        "date": "May 30, 2023 10:38 am",
        "content": "Ugandas President Yoweri Museveni signed one of the worlds toughest anti-LGBTQ laws, including the death penalty for aggravated homosexuality, drawing Western condemnation and risking sanctions from aid donors. Same-sex relations were already illegal in Uganda, as in more than 30 African countries, but the new law goes further. It stipulates capital punishment for serial offenders against the law and transmission of a terminal illness like HIVAIDS through gay sex. It also decrees a 20-year sentence for promoting homosexuality. The Ugandan president has today legalised state-sponsored homophobia and transphobia, said Clare Byarugaba, a Ugandan rights activist. United States President Joe Biden called the move a tragic violation of human rights and said Washington would evaluate the implications of the law on all aspects of U.S. engagement with Uganda. We are considering additional steps, including the application of sanctions and restriction of entry into the United States against anyone involved in serious human rights abuses or corruption, he said. A presidency photo of Museveni showed him signing the law with a golden pen at his desk. The 78-year-old has called homosexuality a deviation from normal and urged lawmakers to resist imperialist pressure. A local organisation, Human Rights Awareness and Promotion Forum, and 10 other individuals later filed a complaint against the law at the constitutional court, one of the petitioners, Busingye Kabumba, told Reuters. Museveni had sent the original bill passed in March back, asking parliament to tone down some provisions. But his ultimate approval was not seen as in doubt in a conservative country where anti-LGBTQ attitudes have hardened in recent years, in part due to campaigning by Western evangelical church groups. Uganda receives billions of dollars in foreign aid each year and could now face adverse measures from donors and investors, as happened with a similar bill nine years ago. The bills sponsor, Asuman Basalirwa, told reporters that parliament speaker Anita Amongs U.S. visa was cancelled after the law was signed. Among and the U.S. embassy in Uganda did not immediately respond to requests for comment. In a joint statement, the U.S.s flagship HIVAIDS programme PEPFAR, the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, and the Joint United Nations Programme on HIVAIDS (UNAIDS) said the law put Ugandas anti-HIV fight in grave jeopardy. Dominic Arnall, chief executive of Open For Business, a coalition of companies that includes Google (GOOGL.O) and Microsoft (MSFT.O), said the group was deeply disappointed and the law ran counter to Ugandans economic interests. The U.N. human rights body declared itself appalled. Ugandas move could encourage lawmakers in neighbouring Kenya and Tanzania seeking similar measures. What a leader weve in Africa! tweeted George Kaluma, a Kenyan member of parliament who submitted an anti-LGBTQ bill in April. Kenya is following you in this endeavour to save humanity. The inclusion of the death penalty for offences like transmitting HIV has drawn particular outrage internationally. Existing Ugandan law calls for a maximum 10-year sentence for intentionally transmitting HIV and does not apply when the person who contracted the infection was aware of their sexual partners HIV status. By contrast, the new law makes no distinction between intentional and unintentional transmission and contains no exception based on awareness of HIV status. The amended version of the bill, adopted earlier this month after Museveni returned it to parliament, stipulated that merely identifying as LGBTQ is not a crime and revised a measure that obliged people to report homosexual activity to only require reporting when a child is involved. LGBTQ Ugandans called those changes useless, saying law enforcement regularly exceeds its legal authorities to harass them. They said passage of the bill in March unleashed a wave of arrests, evictions and mob attacks. The issue has been a long-running one in Uganda. A less restrictive 2014 anti-LGBTQ law was struck down by a Ugandan court on procedural grounds, after Western governments had initially suspended some aid, imposed visa restrictions and curtailed security cooperation. In 2009, a bill dubbed kill the gays for initially proposing executing homosexuals was introduced after a conference in Kampala drew representatives from the United States including prominent anti-gay evangelical Scott Lively. As well as religious campaigning, Africas anti-LGBTQ attitudes also have their roots in the colonial era, including an anti-sodomy section of Britains penal code. By the time the UK legalised same-sex acts in 1967, many former colonies were independent and did not inherit the legal change. To reduce any kind of human being, irrespective of their sexuality, to a death sentence based on who they identify as and how they choose to live their lives is something that we should all feel very ashamed about as a continent, said South African filmmaker Lerato.

        "date": "May 30, 2023 01:06 pm",
        "content": "The Controller-General of Immigration and Emigration, Harsha Ilukpitiya says an online passport application system will be implemented in the coming days pursuant to President Ranil Wickremesinghes initiative to digitize the public service. He said this new process aims to streamline the passport application process and ensure that passports are delivered to applicants residences within a span of three days. During his appearance on the 101 Katha program produced by the Presidential Media Division (PMD), Ilukpitiya highlighted the development of this procedure and its wide availability. To facilitate the efficient delivery of passports, Ilukpitiya said 50 regional secretariats across the island have been equipped with the necessary facilities. Once applicants submit their relevant applications to the nearest Regional Secretariat and complete the required procedures, the passport would be dispatched to their residence via a courier service within three days. This initiative comes in response to reports of brokers causing disruptions in the passport issuance process, according to the Immigration and Emigration chief. As a result, Minister of Public Security Tiran Alas issued instructions to the Immigration  Emigration Department to develop an innovative program to eliminate such interference. The department aims to popularize this newly designed program during the month of June, marking a significant milestone in its history. Achieving a successful execution of this program during the departments 75th anniversary next year would be a remarkable accomplishment, Ilukpitiya noted. Under the new system, individuals can conveniently apply for passports from their homes by visiting the official website of the department - www.immigration.gov.lk. By selecting the Apply for Passports option and validating the provided information, applicants will receive the necessary application form. Before uploading the soft copy of the form, applicants can specify whether they prefer the expedited three-day service or the standard two-week service. Subsequent to this, applicants must visit their Divisional Secretariat to provide their fingerprints and make the required payment via the online system offered by the Bank of Ceylon (BOC). For those who are unable to complete the process at home, they can visit an authorized photo studio under the Immigration and Emigration Department to obtain the necessary documents and fulfil the requirements. In case individuals encounter difficulties making online payments after visiting the Divisional Secretariat and providing their fingerprints, alternative payment facilities are available. After submitting their fingerprints, the Divisional Secretariat will provide a designated number, which can be presented to the BOC. The due amount will then be transferred to the Immigration  Emigration Department. To support these efforts, fingerprint scanners and cameras have been deployed in the 50 Divisional Secretariat Offices, and the Department of Posts has introduced a dedicated courier service. Through a collaborative arrangement with the postal service, passports will be delivered to applicants residences using this courier service, ensuring a swift three-day turnaround. Furthermore, comprehensive measures have been implemented to prevent any irregularities in the process, with the utilization of advanced technology to the fullest extent possible to maintain efficiency and integrity.",

        "date": "May 30, 2023 03:18 pm",
        "content": "Disneys live-action movie The Little Mermaid brought in 117.5 million at the US box office in the fifth-best opening for Memorial Day weekend in history, according to Box Office Mojo. The remake of the 1989 Disney animated classic stars Halle Bailey as Ariel. Baileys adaptation of the titular character was widely praised by critics, although the movie as a whole got a decidedly mixed reaction. On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, just 67 of critics gave the movie a favorable review. Audiences were far more pleased with the film, with 95 giving it a thumbs up on Rotten Tomatoes. But IMDB, which also tracks audience reviews, said it had to adjust some of its ratings overseas after it found the movie was a victim of review-bombing. The Little Mermaid remake has been the subject of controversy in right-wing media and on some social platforms  with users posting racist tropes  because Disney cast Ariel with a black actress. The trailer for the film made its debut earlier this year, setting off a debate about whether Ariel should be Black or White. Rob Marshall, the films director, called critics complaints about casting a Black actor small-minded, in an interview with Vanity Fair. Many have argued that casting a Black actress in the role helps Black children feel represented in popular culture. Disney first introduced a Black princess in 2009, with Tiana in The Princess and the Frog. But Disney has recast characters originally portrayed as White with actors of different races before, including its 1997 remake of Cinderella with Brandy, a Black actress. Disneys live-action remake of Aladdin also debuted on Memorial Day weekend in 2019. That came in a hair lower than The Little Mermaid with an opening weekend haul of 116.8 million. Including international ticket sales, The Little Mermaid brought in 185.8 million over the weekend. Source  CNN -Agencies",

        "content": "The Sri Lankan government has made it mandatory to test imported dried fish, sprats and fruits for heavy metals such as lead and arsenic with effect from June 01, 2023. A survey conducted by the Food Control Administration Unit of the Health Ministry between 2021 and 2022 found that certain consignments of imported dried fish, sprats and fruits contain heavy metals, especially lead and arsenic, in large quantities. According to this survey, some imported fruit stocks contain alarming levels of lead  an extremely toxic heavy metal. Given the severity of the situation, the government decided to make it mandatory that dried fish, sprats and fruits imported to Sri Lanka be tested for heavy metals including lead and arsenic. The Food Control Administration Unit has advised the importers to ensure that the amount of heavy metals and arsenic present in dried fish, sprats and fruits brought in from overseas does not exceed the permitted minimum level.

        "date": "May 30, 2023 03:54 pm",
        "content": "The NATO-led peacekeeping force in Kosovo, KFOR, on Tuesday raised the number of its troops injured in fierce clashes with ethnic Serbs to 30. The Serbs had tried to take over the offices of one of the municipalities in northern Kosovo where ethnic Albanian mayors took up their posts last week. A statement said that 11 Italian soldiers and 19 Hungarian ones sustained multiple injuries, including fractures and burns from improvized explosive incendiary devices. It added that three Hungarian soldiers were wounded by the use of firearms, but their injuries are not life-threatening. The Serbs clashed with NATO troops in the municipality of Zvecan, 45 kilometers (28 miles) north of the capital, Pristina. Both parties need to take full responsibility for what happened and prevent any further escalation, rather than hide behind false narratives, said KFOR commander Maj.-Gen. Angelo Michele Ristuccia. Ethnic Serbs plan to gather again on Tuesday. Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic spent the night with his troops on the border with Kosovo. They were placed on the highest state of alert on his orders last week. Vucic said 52 Serbs were injured in the clashes, three seriously. Kosovo police said four people were detained. The violence was the latest incident as tensions soared over the past weekend when ethnic Serbs in northern Kosovo tried to block recently elected ethnic Albanian officials from entering municipal buildings. Kosovo police fired tear gas to disperse the crowd and let the new officials into the offices. Serbia put the countrys military on high alert and sent more troops to the border with Kosovo. Kosovo and Serbia have been foes for decades, with Belgrade refusing to recognize Kosovos 2008 sovereignty. The United States and the European Union have stepped up efforts to help solve the Kosovo-Serbia dispute, fearing further instability in Europe as Russias war rages in Ukraine. The EU has made it clear to both Serbia and Kosovo that they must normalize relations if theyre to make any progress toward joining the bloc. Western ambassadors of the so-called Quint  France, Italy, Germany, the United Kingdom and United States  met in Pristina with Prime Minister Albin Kurti, asking him to take steps to de-escalate and lower tensions, while strongly denouncing the Serbs violence against KFOR troops and journalists. Ultra-nationalistic Serb graffiti on NATO vehicles is a dark reminder in Kosovo We stand for peace and security, said Kurti after the meeting. Quint ambassadors are to meet with Vucic, and he is also meeting with Russian and Chinese ambassadors to show he has support for his policies. Ethnic Serbs in Zvecan, Leposavic, Zubin Potok and Mitrovica, four municipalities in the north, held elections last month that were largely boycotted by ethnic Serbs. Only ethnic Albanian or other smaller minority representatives were elected to the mayoral posts and assemblies. The conflict in Kosovo erupted in 1998 when separatist ethnic Albanians rebelled against Serbias rule, and Serbia responded with a brutal crackdown. About 13,000 people, mostly ethnic Albanians, died. NATOs military intervention in 1999 eventually forced Serbia to pull out of the territory. Washington and most EU countries have recognized Kosovo as an independent state, but Serbia, Russia and China havent. Source  The Associated Press -Agencies",

        "date": "May 30, 2023 04:08 pm",
        "content": "Deputy Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) Kenji Okamura will arrive in Sri Lanka tomorrow (May 31) for a two-day official visit, State Minister of Finance Shehan Semasinghe says. During his visit to the island nation, Okamura is expected to hold several rounds of discussions on the recent changes in Sri Lankas economic stability and the opportunities to empower the economy in the future. The discussions will also focus on the methods to minimize the obstacles and delays hampering the economic recovery. Okamuras visit comes days after the IMF staff teams visit to Sri Lanka, which was part of the regular consultations between the global lender and the island nation, ahead of the first review mission later in 2023. The delegation was led by Krishna Srinivasan, the IMFs Director of Asia and Pacific Department; Peter Breuer, the Asia and Pacific Departments Senior Mission Chief for Sri Lanka; and Sarwat Jahan, the IMF Resident Representative in Sri Lanka. The IMF staff teams visit came after the first meeting of Sri Lankas official bilateral creditors committee, during which the island nations authorities formally presented a request for debt treatment. China, Saudi Arabia and Iran were in attendance as observers. The committee, co-chaired by India, Japan and France, consists of 17 members and includes Paris Club creditors as well as other official bilateral creditors. On April 14, France, India and Japan unveiled a common platform for talks among bilateral creditors to co-ordinate restructuring of Sri Lankas debt. Addressing the launch of Sri Lankas debt restructuring process, the IMFs Deputy Managing Director had said that an expeditious debt resolution is needed for Sri Lanka to emerge as quickly as possible from its crisis. Okamura also expressed hope that all bilateral creditors would participate in negotiations and complete them before the first review. Sri Lanka owes USD 7.1 billion to bilateral creditors, government data show, with USD 3 billion owed to China, followed by USD 2.4 billion to the Paris Club of creditor nations and USD 1.6 billion to India. The Extended Fund Facility (EFF) program of the IMF approved by its executive board in March comes with strict conditionalities for economic reforms. Sri Lanka had to secure assurances from official bilateral creditors that they would help debt relief andor financing to restore debt sustainability consistent with the IMF-supported EFF program, as well as an assessment that the authorities are making good faith efforts to reach a private agreement with private creditors. As these requirements were met ahead of the IMF Board meeting in March, the IMF approved the 48-month extended arrangement of 2.286 billion SDR (Special Drawing Rights), which amounts to USD 3 billion, for Sri Lanka.",

        "content": "The Ministerial Consultative Committee has approved the orders made by the Minister of Public Security under the Immigrants and Emigrants Act to revise the fine of US500, in addition to the visa fees, to foreigners who have overstayed their period of valid visas.

The companys shares were last up 3.5 at 402.91 in premarket trading. Meta, valued at about 670 billion as of last close, clinched the trillion-dollar market capitalization milestone in 2021, while Apple Inc, Alphabet Inc, Microsoft Corp and Amazon.com Inc are the other U.S. companies that are part of the club. AI took center stage after Nvidia stunned investors with a revenue forecast last week that surpassed analysts expectations by more than 50. Wall Street analysts called Nvidias forecast unfathomable and cosmological, hiking their price targets in droves. The highest price target valued the company at about 1.6 trillion, on par with Google-parent Alphabet. Nvidias shares rose about 25 last week sparking a rally in AI-related stocks and boosted other chipmakers, helping the Philadelphia SE Semiconductor index close on Friday at its highest in over a year.

The self-styled prophet, in the FR petition filed through his attorneys on May 26, had sought an order preventing the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) from arresting him. When the petition is taken up for consideration before open courts on June 05, Presidents Counsel Rienzi Arsecularatne will present submissions on behalf of Pastor Jerome. The Inspector-General of Police (IGP), the DIG in charge of the CID, the CID director and the Officer-in-Charge (OIC) of the cybercrimes unit of the CID have been named as the respondents of the FR petition. Deeming the CIDs attempt to arrest him is unlawful, Pastor Fernando has noted his comments do not threaten the religious harmony in the country. Pastor Fernando, who wants the Supreme Court to prevent the respondents from arresting him until the hearing of the FR petition is concluded, is also seeking a court order ruling that his fundamental rights are thus violated. After Pastor Fernandos remarks went viral on social media, stirring much controversy in the country, the CID received a complaint seeking the immediate arrest of the so-called prophet. On May 14, he flew out to Singapore two days before the Colombo Fort Magistrates Court issued a foreign travel ban on him. However, the police said Pastor Fernando could be arrested upon his return to the island nation. While in Singapore, Pastor Fernando apologized to Buddhist, Hindu and Muslim devotees had his words by any means hurt them emotionally, albeit saying that he has done nothing wrong.",

        "date": "May 31, 2023 07:11 am",
        "content": "Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishidas eldest son, Shotaro Kishida, will be removed from his position as his fathers political secretary on Thursday, following media reports about a controversial year-end party at the prime ministers official residence last December. Images of Shotaro Kishida and relatives having photos taken at symbolically important locations in the residence, including at the staircase used to unveil the last Cabinet as they mimicked members of the political body, surfaced in the media last week. The government had initially reacted by saying that the prime minister had reprimanded his son for inappropriate behavior, but had no intention to dismiss him. The prime minister has taken responsibility for his sons appointment. I will fulfill my responsibilities by listening carefully to the voice of the people and striving to tackle issues that cannot be postponed, the prime minister told reporters Monday. Fumio Kishida said that his sons behavior was inappropriate for a political secretary, and that given the situation in his constituency in Hiroshima has settled down following the Group of Seven leaders summit in the city, he thought this was the best timing. From Thursday, Takayoshi Yamamoto, a long-term secretary of the prime minister who is currently working as personal secretary in Fumio Kishidas lawmakers office, and who served as political secretary during the prime ministers first year in office, will take over the position from Shotaro Kishida. The prime ministers son has said he will return his severance pay, year-end bonuses and any other allowances he might be entitled to, Chief Cabinet Secretary Hirokazu Matsuno told reporters Tuesday. The prime ministers decision to sack his son comes after opinion polls registered a small drop in the prime ministers popularity, likely due to the media reports. A Nikkei survey conducted between last Friday and Sunday showed a 5 percentage point decrease in the Cabinets approval ratings from April, bringing it down to 47. The numbers came as a surprise to government officials, and could have a potential impact on the political calendar  there are growing rumors that an election may be called, which had been bolstered by an upward trend in the approval figures over the past few months. The controversy over the pictures comes less than four months after Shotaro Kishida was reported to have used official vehicles for shopping during his fathers diplomatic tour to France, the United Kingdom and Canada. On that occasion, government officials defended Shotaro Kishidas behavior, adding that his shopping spree was part of his official duties as secretary, which included public relations activities for the Prime Ministers Office, buying souvenirs on behalf of his father and meeting with officials from international organizations. Fumio Kishida, who faced allegations of nepotism after Shotaros appointment last October, isnt the first prime minister to have appointed his son as his political secretary  the most recent example being Yasuo Fukuda, who picked his son Tatsuo when he was prime minister from 2007 to 2008. Many observers had interpreted the nomination of Shotaro Kishida as a political choice, with Fumio Kishida seen as trying to help his son gain political experience with the ultimate goal of making him his successor in parliament. Kishida already dismissed one of his closest aides in early February over derogatory remarks about sexual minorities. Kenta Izumi, leader of the opposition Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan, said that the dismissal of Shotaro Kishida was inevitable and criticized the prime minister for his lack of responsibility. (The prime minister) has repeatedly mixed up his public and private affairs, and didnt explain or apologize to the public, he told reporters on Monday evening. Source: The Japan Times -Agencies",

        "content": "The Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) says it has conducted investigations into several institutions to ascertain whether they have conducted schemes prohibited in terms of the Banking Act, based on some complaints received by the CBSL. In relation to the examination conducted under Section 83C of the Banking Act. No 30 of 1988, the CBSL has determined that few entities have conducted prohibited schemes in contravention of the provisions of section 83C of the said Act. The relevant entities are; 1. Tiens Lanka Health Care (Pvt) Ltd. 2. Best Life International (Pvt) Ltd. 3. Global Lifestyle Lanka (Pvt) Ltd. 4. Mark-Wo International (Pvt) Ltd. 5. VML International (Pvt) Ltd. 6. Fast 3Cycle International (Pvt) Ltd (F3C) 7. Sport Chain App, Sports Chain ZS Society Sri Lanka 8. OnmaxDT Accordingly, the CBSL warned that any person who directly or indirectly initiate, offer, promote, advertise, conduct, finance, manage or direct, a prohibited type of pyramid scheme in contravention of the provisions of the Banking Act shall be a punishable offence such as imprisonment for a period not exceeding three years or a fine not exceeding one million rupees or both imprisonment and fine. Furthermore, where the offence is committed willfully or knowingly, or with the knowledge that the act will cause damage or harm to any other person, the individual is liable to rigorous imprisonment for a term not less than three years and not more than five years and to a fine of Rs. 02 million or twice the aggregate amount in Sri Lanka currency revealed or divulged to have been received from the participants in the Scheme, whichever is higher, according to the CBSL. Thus, the CBSL notifies the general public to refrain from such activities which may be punished by law, adding that the rumours that the Central Bank of Sri Lanka has reached some agreements with the institutions that are currently named as pyramid schemes based on the investigations conducted by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka, is not accurate. The CBSL has also requested the Attorney General to consider instituting criminal proceedings in terms of the provisions of Section 83C of the Banking Act.",

        "date": "May 31, 2023 02:22 pm",
        "content": "After topping global currency rankings this year, analysts are predicting tough times ahead for the Sri Lankan rupee as the government eases import restrictions and debt repayments loom. The rupee, which closed at 294.07 per dollar on Tuesday, is forecast to decline to 350 by the end of December, according to Standard Chartered Plc and BMI. The currencys 25 gain this year has seen it capture the best spot returns globally, supported by rising tourist arrivals and inflows into the bond market. Sri Lankas economy is slowly emerging from its worst crisis in more than seven decades, anchored by the International Monetary Funds 3 billion bailout that helped it regain investor confidence. As the government moves to loosen import controls and secure a debt restructuring deal, the rupee may come under pressure once more and set course for new lows. Once imports normalize with the relaxation of restrictions and demand picks up, we expect the rupee to depreciate, said Dimantha Mathew, head of research at First Capital Holdings Plc in Colombo. The rupee will be highly volatile as the economy picks up toward the second half of the year. The government plans to lift import controls on 100 items by the start of June, State Minister for Finance Shehan Semasinghe said last week. The number of items with import restrictions has already been reduced to 1,000 from a peak of 3,000, he said. Visitors to the Asian nation have also risen, with tourism receipts estimated to have gained 18 to 696 million in January to April from a year ago, according to central bank data. Meanwhile, foreign holdings of local bonds have more than doubled since the end of March to 511 million. The rupee may trade at 280 to 320 per dollar this quarter before weakening to as low as 405 per dollar in the second half of the year, according to First Capital. That would surpass its record-low 370 per dollar it reached in 2022. Dollar inflows have also allowed the central bank to replenish its foreign-exchange reserves, which climbed to a 15-month high in March. Upcoming external debt repayments, which we believe could start around the fourth quarter, alongside the need to build up reserves, will exert downside pressure on the rupee once again in the coming months, said Raphael Mok, head of Asia country risk at BMI in Singapore.

Mitigating the risk of extinction from AI should be a global priority alongside other societal-scale risks such as pandemics and nuclear war, reads their 22-word statement. This statement, published by a San Francisco-based non-profit, the Center for AI Safety, co-signed by prominent figures such as OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis, as well as Geoffrey Hinton and Youshua Bengio  two of the three AI researchers who won the 2018 Turing Award, sometimes referred to as the Nobel Prize of computing. AI experts, journalists, policymakers, and the public are increasingly discussing a broad spectrum of important and urgent risks from AI, the preamble to the 22-word statement reads. Even so, it can be difficult to voice concerns about some of advanced AIs most severe risks. The succinct statement below aims to overcome this obstacle and open up discussion. It is also meant to create common knowledge of the growing number of experts and public figures who also take some of advanced AIs most severe risks seriously. More voices for control of AI This statement adds to the ongoing and controversial discussion about the safety of artificial intelligence. At the start of this year, a group of people supporting the 22-word warning, including Steve Wozniak, Elon Musk, and 1000 others, wrote an open letter asking for a six-month pause in AI development. Recent months have seen AI labs locked in an out-of-control race to develop and deploy ever more powerful digital minds that no one  not even their creators  can understand, predict, or reliably control, the letter read. Dan Hendrycks, the executive director of the Center for AI Safety, told the New York Times that the statement released today was intentionally kept simple to prevent disagreements. Hendrycks explained that they did not want to overwhelm people with too many potential solutions and dilute the message. The statement was a way for people in the industry to express their concerns about the dangers of AI, which is often misunderstood as being only a concern for a few individuals. Hendrycks clarified that many people in the AI community privately share these concerns. Source - Times of India -Agencies",

Soaring inflation has battered the economy for more than a year after a severe foreign exchange crisis set off the Indian Ocean islands worst financial crisis in seven decades. The Colombo Consumer Price Index (LKCCPIECI) (CCPI) reflected a reduction in food inflation to 21.5 in May from 30.6 in April, while non-food inflation reached 27, the Census and Statistics Department said in a statement. Coming off a high base is helping Sri Lankas inflation reduce rapidly and we expect this to continue in the coming months, said Dimantha Mathew, head of research at First Capital. Sri Lanka is on track to hit single-digit inflation by September or, perhaps, even a bit earlier. Easing inflation is also likely to prompt the central bank to keep its policy rates unchanged. Thirteen of 15 analysts and economists polled by Reuters expect the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) to hold benchmark rates steady on Thursday, at the years fourth policy rate announcement, set for 7:30 a.m. (0200 GMT) The figure for national consumer price inflation, released with a lag of 21 days every month, eased to 33.6 year-on-year in April.

        "content": "The Government has refuted recent allegations made pertaining to the lack of funding towards the Anuradhapura Poson Programme, stating that Rs. 28.8 million has already been granted for this purpose. Accordingly, two Ministries and one Department have, thus far, contributed a sum of Rs. 28.8 million for the Anuradhapura Poson Programme this year, the Presidents Media Division (PMD) reported. They further noted the allocation made by the Ministry of Buddhasasana, Religious and Cultural Affairs for the Poson Mihintale Perahera this year was the highest since 2019. Attached below is the full statement released by the PMD: Accusations have been made by various parties claiming that the Government will not contribute to the state Poson festival in 2023, particularly the Poson programs cantered around the Mihintale sacred site. This information was gathered through multiple sources, including the Ministry of Buddhasasana, Religious and Cultural Affairs; Ministry of Public Administration, Home Affairs, Provincial Councils, and Local Government; Ministry of Defence, Sri Lanka Police, Anuradhapura District Secretariat, Ministry of Water Supply and Estate Infrastructure Development and Associated Newspapers Ceylon Limited. In 1963, the Lake House Company initiated the Lakehouse Mihintale Aloka Pooja under the guidance of Mr. Ranjith Wijewardene, aiming to serve religious and social purposes. Over the past 59 years, financial assistance has been provided for various activities such as Aloka Pooja, Sati Piritha, Perahara, and Chaitya painting. During the Covid-19 period in 20202021 and in 2022, financial assistance was extended with amounts of Rs. 4.6 million, Rs. 2.3 million, and Rs.2.9 million, respectively. However, the Lake House Company has been continuously incurring financial losses since 2018, with a loss of Rs. 192 million in 2022. Consequently, the management has notified the Mihintale Poson Committee that they cannot sponsor the programs this year due to these dire circumstances. Venerable Valahangunawewe Dhammarathana Thera, the incumbent monk of Mihintale Rajamaha Viharaya, forwarded an estimate of Rs.17 million to the Secretary of the Ministry of Buddha Sasana, Religious and Cultural Affairs, specifically for the Mihintale Poson Perahara. However, the Ministry Secretary, Mr. Somaratne Widanapathirana, responded that allocating such a large sum of money is not possible within the financial regulations imposed by Parliament. Instead, the Ministry of Buddhasasana, Religious and Cultural Affairs have approved a sum of Rs. 3.1 million from its budget head allocations for the 2023 National Poson Festival. Also, the Secretary presented a report of the expenses incurred by the Ministry for the Poson Mihindu Perahara held at the Mihintale Rajamaha Viharaya from 2019 to 2023. Accordingly, for the year 2019 a sum of Rs. 4,810,000, for the year 2020 Rs. 380,000, for the year 2021 Rs.940,000, for the year 2022 Rs. 2,150,000 had been granted by the Ministry for the Poson Mihindu Maha Perahara at the Mihintale Rajamaha Viharaya. Further, the Secretary also mentioned that there is a Cabinet decision to reduce the approved budget heads by 6 for all Ministries, but this reduction does not apply to the Poson program. Secretary of the Public Administration Ministry K.D.N. Ranjith Asoka also said that an additional Rs.10 million has also been disbursed to the District Secretariats under the approval of the Anuradhapura District Secretary. The National Water Supply and Drainage Board have agreed to supply 30,000 cubic meters of water for the drinking water and sanitary needs during the National Poson Festival. This includes the installation of pumps, extension of water pipes for Dansal areas, installation of 400 water taps around the Anuradhapura Sacred City, Mihintale, and Tanthirimale shrines, water supply by water bowsers, and extension of water pipes for temporary toilet systems constructed by Municipal and Local Councils. The Water Supply and Drainage Board Chairman, Mr. Nishantha Ranatunga, stated that the cost of these water-related services, including the installation of water tanks and tap systems at gathering places and providing water to the tanks along the Perahara route for the elephants, amounts to Rs. 15.7 million (excluding VAT), which will be covered corporately. The Ministry of Defence has deployed troops from the Armed Forces and the Civil Service Department (CSD) to construct the Anuradhapura Poson Zone, encompassing Mihintale, Thanthirimale, and Sanda Hiru Seya. For the proposed Mihintale Perahara on June 2nd, 384 soldiers and officers will be deployed. Also, from 18th April to 31st May 2023, 146 Army soldiers and 30 Air Force personel have been deployed for various activities at the Mihintale Shrine. The Ministry of Defence confirms that from May 22nd to 28th, 410 soldiers of the Army and 525 soldiers of the CSD have been deployed for the development of the Mihintale Sacred site and other tasks of the Poson program. During the Poson Committee meeting held on May 24, 2023, at the Mihintale Raja Maha Viharaya and on May 25, 2023, at the District Secretariat office, Mr. J.M.J.K. Jayasundara, the Anuradhapura District Secretary, highlighted that several tasks were agreed upon with the involvement of District and Local Government institutions. As part of these arrangements, the offering of afternoon alms to the 60,000 worshippers observing Sil at the Uda Maluwa and Mihintale Shrine sites will be carried out with contributions from all the Divisional Secretariat Offices in the Anuradhapura District. Furthermore, the Bank of Ceylon will provide the evening Gilan Pasa for devotees who observe Sil during the festival. The Anuradhapura Municipal Council has already commenced the construction of 350 temporary toilets and the Mihintale Pradeshiya Sabha will establish 80 temporary toilets around the Mihintale sacred site for the sanitary convenience of the visiting pilgrims. Apart from this, the Department of Archaeology and the Central Nuwaragam Palatha Pradeshiya Sabha are working to provide sanitation services. With the intervention of the Regional Director of Health Services and the Director of the Anuradhapura Teaching Hospital, all Government hospitals will be operational 24 hours a day and the Old City Hospital will also be operational round the clock to provide emergency treatment. 150 officers of the Sri Lanka Police, 15 officers of the Sri Lanka Navy and 40 officers of the Civil Service Department and 140 officers representing voluntary organizations will be engaged in life-saving services during the Poson week to address emergencies. In addition, with the intervention of the Sri Lanka Police, a patrol program and lifeboats have been deployed covering 26 lakes in the vicinity of Anuradhapura with five police officers at each location. A special security committee consisting of Senior Deputy Inspector General of Police in the North Central Province, Deputy Inspector General of Police in Anuradhapura, Senior Superintendent of Police in Anuradhapura and Officer-in-Charge of the Mihintale Police Station have been appointed on the advice of the Inspector General of Police for the safety of the pilgrims and the implementation of the traffic plan. The Sri Lanka Railway Department has also provided special transport facilities during the Poson week. Accordingly, 10 additional trains have been deployed and steps have also been taken to increase train commutes, the General Manager of Railways stated. Meanwhile, the Anuradhapura District Secretary says that the Sri Lanka Transport Board and the Road Passenger Transport Authority will jointly operate a special bus service. Thus, it appears that Rs. 28.8 million (288 lakh rupees) has been allocated for Mihintale Poson programs solely by two Government Ministries and one Department. Apart from that, steps have already been taken by the District Secretariat, Divisional Secretariats, Municipal Councils and Pradeshiya Sabha to provide financial allocations for many other tasks and to provide the labour contribution of the Armed Forces. In light of the foregoing, it is confirmed that the claims made by various parties alleging that the Government will not contribute to the State Poson Festival and other Poson activities cantered around the Mihintale sacred site are false and baseless.",

        "content": "One of the two Cardiac Catheterization machines established in the Kandy National Hospital has completely broken down since May 06, 2023. The Government Radiological Technologists Association points out that as a result, the lives of around 8,000 patients in the waiting lists for diagnosis and treatment of heart diseases are at risk. Cardiac Catheterization Unit performs a wide range of diagnostics and treatments, including detecting blockages in the coronary arteries that supply blood to the heart, performing stent treatments, and identifying and repairing holes (Atrial Septal Defect) in the heart. Accordingly, 14 Cardiac Catheterization machines have been established within 11 hospitals island-wide, while 02 of them are owned by the Kandy National Hospital. Meanwhile, the Government Radiological Technologists Association mentions that the air conditioning system of the building where the two brand new machines installed in the Radiotherapy Unit of the Kandy National Hospital that treats cancer patients, has been out since November last year, and that it has not yet been repaired even after 6 months. In the meantime, the Association of Health Professionals claims that the Radiotherapy units, Laboratories and Renal functional units across the island have been impaired. Moreover, the patients visiting the outpatient departments (OPD) of government hospitals undergo much inconvenience since they have to buy several types of medicines from private pharmacies. In such a backdrop, the Health Professionals Association stresses that still there is a shortage of around 150 to 200 types of essential drugs within government hospitals. Meanwhile, the Minister of Health Keheliya Rambukwella has instructed the officials to take necessary measures to reduce the price of medicines compared to the appreciation of the Sri Lankan Rupee as soon as possible. Accordingly, the minister has indicated that the price of medicines should be reduced by at least 15 compared to the decrease in the rate of the US Dollar. Under these circumstances, the signing of the agreement to extend the USD 1,000 million assistance scheme from India for the import of essential materials for a further period of one year was carried out yesterday (May 30), according to State Minister of Finance Shehan Semasinghe.",

The Sri Lankan premier is in Thailand to attend the two-day celebrations marking Vesak or Visakha Bucha in Thai, which commemorates the birth, enlightenment and death of Buddha. Thailand is hosting the 18th United Nations Day of Vesak Celebration 2023 on the theme Buddhist Wisdom Coping with Global Crises, a subject Gunawardena is scheduled to speak on during the event. More than 3,500 monks and religious figures are expected to arrive in Thailand to attend ceremonies that will be held in Bangkok and Ayutthaya on Thursday and Friday. Once the ceremony is over, Prayut and Gunawardena are expected to discuss the Thailand-Sri Lanka free trade agreement, which should be finalised by next year. Gunawardena has also asked Prayut to promote investment in the Port City Colombo project, saying Sri Lanka can profit from Thailands expertise in the hospitality industry. Port City Colombo is a special economic zone and financial hub being built on the southern edge of the capital. The new city is part of Chinas Belt and Road Initiative. Also on the agenda will be discussions on coping with global geopolitical tensions as well as Sri Lankas ongoing problems. Prayut said Thailand is ready to share its knowledge on subjects like public health, agriculture, tourism, the bio-circular-green economy initiative and other know-how that should help pull Sri Lanka out of its economic doldrums. The country had been hit by acute shortages of essential goods, which sparked months of widespread protests and eventually ousted the governments of Gotabaya Rajapaksa and his successor Ranil Wickremesinghe. Gunawardena is expected to return to Thailand at the end of this year to attend the BIMSTEC Summit. Source - The Nation Thailand -Agencies",

In its report on the External Sector Performance in April 2023, the Central Bank said the exchange rate showed a notable appreciation during April 2023. This notable appreciation of the exchange rate, which commenced in early March 2023 and continued through April 2023, was a result of the continued improvement in liquidity in the domestic foreign exchange market, the discontinuation of the daily guidance on exchange rates, and the mandatory sales requirement by licenced banks and enhanced market sentiments An improvement in the liquidity in the domestic foreign exchange market was observed following the revocation of the mandatory forex sales requirement by licensed banks to the Central Bank from the converted export proceeds and workers remittances and discontinuation of the daily guidance on exchange rates in early March 2023. Accordingly, during the year up to 31 May 2023, the Sri Lankan Rupee appreciated by 22.9 against the USD, the Central Bank added. Meanwhile, reflecting the cross-currency movements, the Sri Lankan Rupee appreciated against the Euro, the Pound Sterling, the Japanese Yen, the Indian Rupee and the Australian Dollar during the year up to 31 May 2023. Consequently, the real effective exchange rate also appreciated notably during April 2023, yet remaining below the threshold of 100 index points, indicating external competitiveness.",

        "date": "June 1, 2023 08:02 am",
        "content": "The Monetary Board of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) has decided to reduce the Standing Deposit Facility Rate (SDFR) and the Standing Lending Facility Rate (SLFR) of the Central Bank by 250 basis points to 13.00 per cent and 14.00 per cent, respectively. The Board arrived at this decision, at its meeting held on 31 May 2023, with a view to easing monetary conditions in line with the faster than expected slowing of inflation, gradual dissipation of inflationary pressures and further anchoring of inflation expectations, the central bank said. The commencing of such monetary easing is expected to provide an impetus for the economy to rebound from the historic contraction of activity witnessed in 2022, while easing pressures in the financial markets. The central bank surprised markets by cutting interest rates for the first time in three years, signalling a change of course to fuel a rebound in the economy of the country which plunged into crisis last year as its foreign exchange reserves ran out, food and energy prices spiraled. The Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) cut its standing deposit facility rate and standing lending facility rate by 250 basis points - to 13 and 14, respectively, from 15.5 and 16.5. The central bank said the big rate cut would help steer the economy towards a rebound phase. While inflation has come down, it remains steep so most analysts had expected the bank to keep rates steady. The rates are now at their lowest level since March 2022, the start of the crisis. The surprise decision was welcomed by markets, with the rupee rising to 288 against the dollar, its highest since April 2022 and the benchmark Colombo Stock Exchange index closing up 1.59, lifting away from five-month lows. The rate cut comes after the key Colombo Consumer Price Index rose 25.2 on year in May compared with 35.3 in April, reducing some stress on the crisis-hit economy. --With agencies inputs",

This includes the swap facility from the People Bank of China, equivalent to around USD 1.4 billion, which is subject to conditionalities on usability. In its latest Monetary Policy Review, the Central Bank said it has absorbed a sizeable amount of foreign exchange from the domestic forex market thus far in 2023, resulting in a steady increase in gross official reserves. The renewed foreign investor appetite for short-term government securities has also helped improve forex liquidity in the recent months. The exchange rate, which is allowed to be determined by market forces, continues to reflect positive market sentiments underpinned by the improvement in liquidity in the domestic forex market. Reflecting the improved balance of payments (BOP) conditions, the Central Bank said it relaxed the cash margin deposit requirements imposed on selected imports in May 2023, and assured that further measures would be initiated to loosen capital flow restrictions in the period ahead.",
