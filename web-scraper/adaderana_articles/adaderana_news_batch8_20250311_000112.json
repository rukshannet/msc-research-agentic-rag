        "date": "March 9, 2023 03:47 pm",
        "content": "The International Monetary Funds anticipated endorsement of Sri Lankas reforms and debt restructuring is expected to unlock funding of about 220 billion yen (1.6 billion) for projects suspended by Japan, people familiar with the matter said. IMF board approval, when it arrives, should help convince the Japanese government to restart several projects that are in different stages of completion, the people said, asking not to be named as the information is not public. The projects involve a 74 billion yen upgrade to the South Asian islands main international airport, and others including energy, water supply, rural infrastructure and waste management, the people said. Cabinet spokesman Bandula Gunawardana told reporters in Colombo Wednesday that Sri Lanka is expecting a restart of suspended loans, including from JICA. A spokesperson for JICA in Tokyo confirmed the importance of IMF decisions, while declining to elaborate on their effects on Japanese projects in Sri Lanka. Resumption of JICA funding will help bolster development financing for the crisis-ridden nation that is looking to turn a corner from its worst economic crisis. While countries such as India continued financing big infrastructure projects despite Sri Lanka defaulting on its overseas debt last year, Japan halted funding, and provided only humanitarian support. The IMF said this week that its board will vote on the 2.9 billion bailout on March 20. The approval could also pave the way for financing from other creditors, including the Japan International Co-operation Agency, World Bank and the Asian Development Bank. Sri Lanka in Talks With ADB, World Bank for Post-IMF Financing Sri Lanka may have to sign new agreements, with revised timelines for the loans, the people said, without giving further details.

        "title": "Sri Lanka adopts first National Action Plan on Women, Peace and Security",
        "date": "March 9, 2023 05:03 pm",
        "content": "Sri Lanka has adopted its first National Action Plan on Women, Peace and Security (WPS), for the period 2023  2027 with the support of the Government of Japan and UN Women. The Plan adds to the countrys legal and policy frameworks to protect and empower women in line with international commitments set out in the UN Security Councils Resolution 1325 (2000). It also aims to strengthen coordination between stakeholders of the women, peace and security agenda, which is vital to sustainable peace and development in Sri Lanka. The Plan, approved by the Cabinet of Ministers on February 27, 2023, was ceremoniously launched on Wednesday (March 08) on the occasion of International Womens Day. The newly adopted National Action Plan has been developed through a consultative process with input from provincial and district level public sector officials, civil society, community-based organizations, women leaders and others with direct and diverse experiences of conflict and crises. It was developed with technical support from UN Women as part of a joint partnership between the Government of Japan and the Government of Sri Lanka. In 2018, the Government of Japan signed a partnership agreement with Sri Lanka under the G7 WPS framework. Speaking in this regard, President Ranil Wickremesinghe stated that while the status of women in the Asian region is not satisfactory, Sri Lankan women are ahead compared to other countries in the region, and efforts will be made to further expand their rights. The National Policy on Gender Equality  Womens Empowerment and the National Action Plan on Women, Peace  Security will aid in achieving this goal, and the progress made so far was revealed on International Womens Day, he emphasized. The Head of State further said: Sri Lanka will host a meeting of leading women activists from SAARC countries this year to advocate for the inclusion of womens rights within the organizations framework. Sri Lanka is committed to working towards achieving gender equality and womens empowerment in all areas and will take a leadership role in championing the rights of women in the Asian region. Highlighting the importance of the National Action Plan, State Minister of Women  Child Affaris Geetha Kumarasinghe said: With the adoption of this action plan, Sri Lanka is equipped for the first time with a policy framework to implement the women, peace and security agenda, which calls for greater participation and representation of women in governance and peacebuilding processes. The National Action Plan further focuses on providing targeted support for women who have been, and continue to be, directly harmed by conflict, violence and climate insecurity. In addition, it aims to strengthen the security of marginalized women and girls, and the economic empowerment of women through access to equal opportunities and resources. Commenting on Sri Lankas progress, the Ambassador of Japan to Sri Lanka, Mizukoshi Hideaki stated: The Government of Japan welcomes the timely adoption of this National Action Plan, which will help Sri Lankas commitments to achieving the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Through our longstanding partnership with UN Women and the Ministry of Women and Child Affairs, Japan is committed to supporting the furtherance of the women, peace and security agenda in Sri Lanka. Meanwhile, Prashani Dias, Head of Office a.i. at UN Women Sri Lanka, said: To help the implementation of this important policy framework, UN Women, with support from the Government of Japan, has provided training on women, peace and security to public-sector officials. Through these programmes, workplans have been jointly developed at the district level to address issues that affect the well-being of women and girls during times of crisis. The UN Women  UN entity dedicated to gender equality and the empowerment of women  says apart from these efforts, it has strengthened womens economic empowerment through entrepreneurship trainings, recognizing that womens access to employment plays a key role in ensuring their security, and provided women leaders including youth, with skills to promote social cohesion in their communities. The adoption of the National Action Plan on Women, Peace and Security marks significant progress on furthering gender-responsive conflict and crisis response, while also strengthening the role of women in peacebuilding and conflict-preventative leadership. -UN Women",

        "title": "Sri Lanka tourism finds new ways to cater to visitors from Middle East",
        "date": "March 9, 2023 09:11 pm",
        "content": "Sri Lankas tourism is trying to cater more to visitors from the Middle East countries, with special initiatives already underway, officials and industry players said on Thursday, as they seek to revive the crisis-hit countrys hospitality sector. Tourism has traditionally been one of the key sources of Sri Lankas foreign reserves and in 2018 earned 4.4 billion, contributing 5.6 percent to the gross domestic product. But this dropped to just 0.8 percent in 2020, as the country received a major blow when the outbreak of COVID-19 halted global travel. To rebound from the pandemic, Sri Lanka declared 2022 the Visit Sri Lanka Year to prioritize the tourism industry in general, but as the country sank deeper into its worst economic crisis in history, it began to realign its strategies and identified the Middle East among its top potential markets, pinning hopes on Gulf Cooperation Council countries, and especially Saudi Arabia. The Arabian market is a key market segment in Sri Lanka tourism, Madubhani Perera, marketing director at the Sri Lanka Tourism Promotion Bureau, told Arab News. She said it was of paramount importance now to build up confidence among visitors from the region so that they would feel culturally comfortable in Sri Lanka and, as industry players are trying to tap into the market, all future promotion campaigns should focus on safety and respect for their culture. Saudi Arabias Ambassador to Colombo Khalid Hamoud Nasser Al-Dasan Al-Qahtani has also recognized Sri Lankas potential in appealing to Arab visitors, provided their comfort in traveling is taken care of. Sri Lanka is an ideal destination for tourists from the KingdomTo make it more attractive, there must be an Arab-friendly environment, he told Arab News. One such initiative to boost the countrys popularity among travelers from the Gulf is now spearheaded by Sri Lankan hospitality veteran Fazal Mohammed, CEO of Al-Araf Hotels and Resorts, who has worked for 30 years in the Saudi hospitality sector, serving in managerial positions in brands such as Fairmont and Raffles in Makkah and Al-Faisaliah Hotel  one of the finest five-star hotels in Riyadh. Mohammeds most recent project is Horton Heights, a super luxury hotel located in the scenic hill city of Nuwara Eliya in Sri Lankas Central Province, which is expected to open its doors to guests this winter. The project is designed for high-end tourists and looks to cater to leisure travelers from the Middle East region, Mohammed told Arab News, adding that it is designed to appeal to leisure travelers from the Middle East, with staff proficient in the Arabic language, high levels of privacy and fine dining experiences. Emphasis is also taken to allow the Middle Eastern traveler to enjoy his or her holiday in the island nation and ensure his daily lifestyle and habits are not disrupted, he said. This means that rooms and facilities will be made available to carry on daily prayers, and halal food options will be available. For Mohammed, Sri Lanka, with its culture and accessibility can easily be an attractive destination for Arab tourists, especially from the Gulf. Sri Lankas natural beauty, including its tropical beaches, lush forests and stunning mountains, is another major draw for Arab tourists, he said. Many visitors are looking to escape the hustle and bustle of city life and enjoy a relaxing vacation in a beautiful setting. Further, the island nation is also becoming increasingly popular among adventure tourists. The island nations efforts in drawing more Arab visitors could not only help revive the industry but also make it contribute again to the economy, which needs a major boost. The potential for Arab visitors in Sri Lanka tourism is significant, with opportunities for increased revenue, job creation and sustainable growth in the industry, Mohammed said. By catering to the specific needs and preferences of Arab tourists, Sri Lanka can establish itself as a top destination in the region and attract a growing number of visitors from this market. Geographic proximity and good weather are other key enablers in doing so. Sri Lanka is easily accessible from the Middle East due to its proximity, and there are many direct flights from the region. One of the key advantages that Sri Lanka has is that the country is geographically located to attract tourists throughout the year, said M. Rizmi Reyal, travel operator and former president of the Sri Lankan chapter of the International Air Transport Association. Sri Lanka is the perfect venue to attract Middle Eastern tourists. We are anticipating Arab tourists to visit Sri Lanka this year, after a lapse of four years. Source - Arab News -Agencies",

        "content": "The Government of Japan has contributed an additional US6.6 million to the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) to provide critical food and nutrition assistance to over one million Sri Lankans. Through this funding, WFP will provide families with food baskets comprising rice, pulses and cooking oil, to meet half their monthly food needs for a period of two months. The donation will also be used to procure maize and soybean for the production of Thriposha, a fortified food product, for a period of four months, which will be supplied to pregnant and breastfeeding mothers and young children at risk of malnutrition. H.E. Mizukoshi Hideaki, Ambassador of Japan to Sri Lanka said, We are pleased to announce that the Government of Japan has decided to provide additional humanitarian support to Sri Lanka in this critical moment. Food aid through WFP by the Government of Japan has reached a total of USD10 million since the economic crisis began last year. This support is being used to provide essential food and nutrition to communities across the nation. WFPs latest surveys indicate that food insecurity is still at a concerningly high level. Seven in every 10 households are adopting negative coping strategies such as cutting back on nutritious food like protein and dairy or skipping meals altogether. Our biggest concern is for the women and children who are among those affected by the impacts of the economic crisis, said Abdur Rahim Siddiqui, Representative and Country Director of WFP Sri Lanka. We are grateful for the continuous support from the Government of Japan which enables us to scale up our efforts so that vulnerable communities receive the food and nutrition they need. Japan has been a long-standing donor to the Government of Sri Lanka and WFP for over a decade, providing critical assistance in emergencies, while supporting longer-term recovery and development efforts to strengthen food and nutrition security in the country. Japans latest funding is an extension of its support to the people of Sri Lanka to help safeguard communities affected by the economic crisis. WFP has reached over two million people since commencing its emergency operation in June last year and is moving closer to its target of reaching 3.4 million people with food and nutrition assistance. --WFP--",

        "date": "March 9, 2023 10:22 pm",
        "content": "Pakistans Finance Minister Ishaq Dar said on Thursday his country was very close to signing a staff level agreement with the International Monetary Fund, which would offer a critical lifeline for taming a balance of payment crisis. An agreement would release 1.1 billion to the cash-strapped South Asian economy. We seem to be very close to signing the staff level agreement, hopefully, God willing, in the next few days, Dar said at a seminar in Islamabad. I and my team are absolutely committed to complete this program to the best of our ability, he said, adding: We have been in the review and I think it has taken longer than it should have in my opinion. Islamabad has been hosting an IMF mission since early February to negotiate the terms of a deal, including the adoption of policy measures to manage its fiscal deficit ahead of the annual budget due around June. The funds are part of a 6.5 billion bailout package the IMF approved in 2019, which analysts say is critical if Pakistan is to avoid defaulting on external debt obligations. Dar said the current crisis was deeper and more complex than the two prior experiences he had overseen as finance minister, but he was confident the economy would be pulled out of the quagmire. He said reforms in the energy sector, which has piled up more than four trillion rupees (14.18 billion) in debt, were the most critical to get the economy back on track. The power sector has to be structurally reformed and fixed and let me endorse that the issue was and has been very grave, he said. The IMF deal would unlock other bilateral and multilateral financing avenues for Pakistan to shore up its foreign exchange reserves, which have fallen to just four weeks worth of import cover. Islamabad has met most of the lenders demands to clear the review. The last one yet to be fulfilled on the list is an assurance on external financing to fund its balance of payment gap for the current fiscal year, which ends on June 30. Long-time ally China is the only country that has announced refinancing of a 2 billion loan, and Pakistans central bank has already received 1.2 billion of that amount. Pakistan had to complete a series of prior actions demanded by the IMF, which included reversing subsidies in the power, export and farming sectors, a hike in energy and fuel prices, a permanent power surcharge, jacking up the key policy rate, a market-based exchange rate, and raising over 170 billion rupee(613.17 million) in new taxation through a supplementary budget. The rupee depreciated 1.19 against U.S dollar in inter-bank trading in Thursdays opening session, but recovered almost half of its losses by afternoon. It has lost around 20 of its value so far this year, extending a near 30 drop in 2022. The fiscal adjustments have already fuelled 50-year record high inflation, which hit 31.5 year-on-year in February. I believe that weve to work together to control the current inflationary pressures, Dar said, adding, theyre unprecedented. Source - Reuters -Agencies",

        "content": "A number of people have been killed in a shooting at a Jehovahs Witness meeting hall in the north German city of Hamburg. Police say the gunman acted alone and is thought to be dead. It is unclear if the attacker is among the six or seven fatalities reported by German media. As yet, there is no reliable information on the motive, police say. A number of people were also injured in the shooting on Deelböge street in the citys Gross Borstel district. Police say they found a dead person at the scene who they believe may have been a perpetrator and investigations are continuing. Police were called around 21:15 (20:15 GMT) to reports that shots had been fired in the building, police spokesman Holger Vehren said. Officers who went in found people who may have been seriously injured by firearms, some of them fatally, he said. The officers also heard a shot from the upper part of the building and went upstairs, where they also found a person. So far we have no indications that any perpetrators fled. He said police had not yet identified the victims and work at the crime scene continued. All we know is that several people have died here, several people have been injured, they have been taken to hospitals, Mr Vehren said. The reasons behind the shooting were still completely unclear.

        "date": "March 10, 2023 09:37 am",
        "content": "Xi Jinping on Friday secured a precedent-breaking third five-year term as Chinas president as he tightens his grip as the countrys most powerful leader since Mao Zedong. Nearly 3,000 members of Chinas rubber-stamp parliament, the National Peoples Congress (NPC), voted unanimously in the Great Hall of the People for Xi, 69, to be president in an election where there was no other candidate. The voting lasted for about an hour and the electronic counting was completed in about 15 minutes. The stage was set for another Xi term when he did away with presidential term limits in 2018. His power was already extended last October when he was reconfirmed for another five years as general secretary of the central committee of the ruling Communist Party. Over the next two days, officials approved by Xi are set to be appointed or elected to fill top positions in the cabinet, including premier-in-waiting Li Qiang, who is expected to be named to Chinas No.2 post, putting him in charge of managing the worlds second-largest economy. Xi chatted casually with Li, who was seated to his left, as delegates deposited voting slips into electronic ballot boxes. The election of state leaders by the parliament comes three months after tough COVID-19 policies were dismantled and a new wave of infections caused by the highly transmissible Omicron strain rippled across the country. Except for dozens of top leaders, all other delegates and staff wore masks. Xi will make a speech on Monday before the annual parliamentary session closes, as China faces multiple challenges including an economy hobbled by three years of COVID curbs and worsening relations with the West. Earlier this week, Xi blamed the United States and the West for the difficulties faced by Chinas economy, remarks unusual from him for being directly at Washington. While the presidential role is largely ceremonial, Xi had already been re-elected by the party to chair its central military commission and has started his third five-year term as the Chinese armed forces commander-in-chief. The parliament also elected Zhao Leji, 66, as the new parliament chair and Han Zheng, 68, as the new vice president. Both men were from Xis previous team of party leaders at the Politburo Standing Committee. Source: Reuters -Agencies",

        "title": "Sri Lanka needs institutional changes for long-term debt sustainability, expert says",
        "date": "March 10, 2023 11:45 am",
        "content": "Sri Lanka needs institutional reforms in order to achieve long-term debt sustainability, said Steve Hanke, who played a key role in establishing new currency regimes in emerging markets like Argentina and Montenegro. The South Asian country is grappling with its worst financial crisis in decades and needs to unlock a 2.9 billion IMF loan that was agreed to in September, to get its public finances in order. Unless you change the institutions and the rules of the game governing these countries, theyre always going to remain in the same ... situation that theyve been in for a long time, Hanke, who is now professor of applied economics at Johns Hopkins University, told CNBCs Squawk Box Asia on Thursday. In fact, most of the personalities involved in Sri Lanka at the high level are exactly the same as theyve been for years. So nothing has changed. Sri Lanka has struggled with severe shortages of food, medicine, fuel and electricity since last year. This has led to angry protests that forced then-President Gotabaya Rajapaksa to flee from the country and resign. The countrys lawmakers chose six-time Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe as president last July as his successor. Hanke, who was previously economic advisor to former U.S. President Ronald Reagan, was also skeptical whether the IMF bailouts will help Sri Lankas crisis-stricken economy in the long term. He pointed out that the country has gone to the fund several times cap in hand for relief. You have to remember that we have a country that since 1965 has had 16 IMF programs and theyve all failed, he said. You get temporary relief in anticipation of a bailout. But in the long run ... none of these IMF programs work. In September, the IMF outlined a series of steps that it wanted Sri Lankas government to implement prior to loan approval, which included major tax reforms. Debt relief from Sri Lankas creditors and additional financing from multilateral partners will be required to help ensure debt sustainability and close financing gaps, the fund said at the time. The IMF declined to comment to CNBC. China support On Tuesday, Wickremesinghe said that China has given crucial debt restructuring assurances that could pave the way for final approval of the IMFs 2.9 billion four-year bailout. We received the letter of financial assurance from EXIM Bank of China last night. Accordingly, on the same night, I and the Governor of the Central Bank signed the letter of agreement and forwarded it to the IMF. Now our duties are done, he told parliament, according to the transcript in local media. I hope that before the end of this month, by the fourth week, the IMF will do its duty. In a follow up tweet, the president said he has spoken with IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva and U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen on this matter. He also mentioned he expects financial assistance from the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank to start coming soon after the IMF deal is reached. In its readout, the U.S. Treasury Department said: During their meeting, Secretary Yellen expressed support for Sri Lankas steps towards an IMF-supported program to advance economic reform and achieve a strong and durable recovery. The Secretary welcomed Sri Lankas commitments to transparency and comparable treatment for all bilateral official and private creditors. IMFs Georgieva also commended Sri Lanka on its progress in resolving its financial situation. I welcome the progress made by Sri Lankan authorities in taking decisive policy actions  obtaining financing assurances from all their major creditors, incl. China, India  the Paris Club, she wrote in a tweet. Look forward to presenting the IMF-supported program to our Exec. Board on March 20. Still, JHUs Hanke said IMF programs do not tend to go down well with the Sri Lankan people. You get the IMF in there trying to manage something, said Hanke. The IMF tends to be ... very unpopular because theyre going to try to introduce and ram through these old institutions that they have in Sri Lanka all kinds of things that the Sri Lankans wont like. During his speech Tuesday, Sri Lankas president underlined there is no room for failure in completing every task agreed upon with the IMF, unlike the previous 16 occasions. The agreement with the IMF is of special importance to restore our economy, and there is no alternative path to be seen at present, said Wickremesinghe. Source: CNBC -Agencies",

Speaking at the Ministerial Consultative Committee held in Parliament yesterday (Mar. 09) the minister pointed out that due to the existing financial issues, there was a shortage of equipment to provide new connections and that with the recent steps to increase the electricity tariffs, the strengthening of the financial sector of the board would enable new connections to be provided. The Minister said this when the Members of Parliament raised issues in the committee that despite a large number of people have registered to get new connections, there is a big delay in issuing connections. Also, the minister said that a program to minimize the cost of the institutions under the ministry, including the CEB and the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC), is currently underway. The Minister further pointed out that by changing the QR code fuel quota update to Tuesday, overtime expenses of nearly Rs. 20 million to be paid to petroleum workers on Saturdays and Sundays can be saved. Also, the Minister mentioned that no new employees will be recruited for these institutions and the expenses have been reduced as much as possible through the management of the currently employed staff. Meanwhile, the Minister has emphasized that smart metering is expected to be introduced soon and arrangements have been made to commence the pilot project in Dehiwala - Mount Lavinia Municipal Council area. The Minister highlighted that it is being implemented with the assistance of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and that 31000 customers will be given smart bills. Accordingly, the customer will receive the bill as e- bills and SMSs without manual reading. Furthermore, the orders published in Gazette No. 231347 and No. 231347 made by the Minister of Power and Energy under the Petroleum Resources Act No. 21 of 2021 were approved during the committee meeting.

At a meeting convened under the chairmanship of Prof. Ranjith Bandara, the COPE examined the Auditor Generals reports for the years of 2019 and 2020, as well as the current performance of SLECIC, only to express its absolute displeasure about the way the institution has been functioning. COPE chairman, shedding light on the failure of the SLECIC to table the Annual Reports, expressed displeasure over the lack of assistance provided to the Auditor General as a responsible government institution. The committee also questions the General Manager of SLECIC as to why a corporate plan was not prepared for more than a decade and on what basis the administration process of the institution was carried out without a corporate plan. The COPE members went on to instruct the SLECIC officials to take immediate measures to present a corporate plan at the earliest possible. Further, the COPE members also inquired as to why 05 main positions of the director board including finance remain vacant. While strongly condemning the actions of the General Manager in steering the institution, the COPE members emphasized that the neglect and inaction of respective officials have resulted in the failure of reaching the set objectives of the institution as per the Act. In this regard, the COPE chairman recommended that the board vacancies be filled with immediate effect to ensure stability and proper institutional mechanism. Whilst expressing disappointment regarding the indolent nature of the Ministry of Finance in looking into the ongoing irregularities of the SLECIC, the COPE chairman recommended that an investigation should be probed through the CID regarding the loss of institutional information of the institution and recommended that the Chairman of the Corporation take immediate action regarding the said matter. Furthermore, recommendations were also made to the Finance Ministry to appoint an independent committee consisting of the Internal Auditor affiliated to the Ministry and to submit a report regarding the financial irregularities of the Corporation within 3 weeks. Recommendations were also given to the Ministry of Finance to conduct a separate investigation regarding the actions of the General Manager of the institution and report to the committee before April 18.",

        "date": "March 10, 2023 04:26 pm",
        "content": "The Chairman of the Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL), Janaka Ratnayake, has filed a Fundamental Rights (FR) Application challenging the February electricity tariff hike. In a statement, the PUCSL Chairman has mentioned that the FR Application was filed both in his capacity as an electricity consumer and in the public interest, especially in the interest of those falling within the lowest brackets units of electricity consumed, who are hardest hit by the tariff hike. Mr. Ratnayake has also challenged the process by which the PUCSL has purportedly approved the tariff hike proposed by the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) contrary to established legal procedures. The approval of the PUCSL is a necessary requirement for a change in tariffs, Ratnayake said, adding that there was no such lawful approval of the commission given to the proposal. Furthermore, he claims that the purported approval given by the commission is an unlawful decision of three of the members and not a decision of the commission. The second basis of the challenge is that the PUCSL is duty-bound to ensure that the interests of all citizens are met when approving a change in tariffs, it added. A tariff that disproportionately affects those within lower usage brackets would put those at the lowest income levels at risk of de- electrification, making even the limited units of electricity consumed by them for basic necessities inaccessible, he emphasized. Ratnayake explains in his Petition that the most economically generated hydropower-based electricity alone would be more than sufficient to service all domestic consumers within the 0-30, 31-60 and 61-90 bands, with a significant portion of such electricity remaining for distribution among other categories. Thus, it is unreasonable that consumers within these brackets are made to pay the price of electricity generated at a much higher cost, according to the PUCSL Chairman.",

        "date": "March 10, 2023 07:42 pm",
        "content": "A team of Criminal Investigation Department (CID) officers will depart for Madagascar tomorrow (March 11) to repatriate Sri Lankan drug kingpin Nadun Chinthaka alias Harak Kata and his infamous accomplice Salindu Malshika alias Kudu Salindu, arrested while on a visit to the Indian Ocean island off the southeastern coast of Africa. On Wednesday (March 08), the defence officials in Madagascar officially informed the Foreign Ministry of Sri Lanka of the arrest of 08 suspects including the drug kingpin Nadun Chinthaka alias Harak Kata and his accomplice identified as Salindu Malshika Gunaratne alias Kudu Salindu. Foreign media reported on Tuesday (March 07) that a Malagasy woman who claims to be his wife and her father were also among the suspects arrested in Madagascar on March 01. LExpress, a leading media network in Madagascar, said the suspects were taken into custody at the Ivato International Airport in Antananarivo, Madagascar while trying to fly out of the country. The arrests had been made in a joint operation conducted by the National Central Bureau (NCB) of the INTERPOL, Madagascars law enforcement authorities and Customs officials. According to LExpress, five of the Sri Lankan suspects had landed in Nosy Be on a private jet on February 12. The group had later travelled to Antananarivo on a domestic flight the following day. After staying at two hotels in Ivato and Ambohimangakely, the suspects had arrived at the airport in two luxury cars. The gendarmes (paramilitary police officers in France or French-speaking countries) had recognized and arrested them with the help of the red notices previously issued by the INTERPOL. During his stay in Madagascar, Harak Kata had posed as a wealthy businessman while Kudu Salindu and the others pretended to be his bodyguards. The two luxury cars and the mobile phones of the suspects were also seized by the Madagascar law-enforcement authorities. Further, a sum of Malagasy Ariary (MGA) 32 million found on the woman who claimed to be the wife of Harak Kata was also confiscated. The arrestees are detained by the Bridage Criminelle (criminal squad) in Anosy. Speaking to Ada Derana on the matter, Sri Lankas Defence Ministry earlier said necessary measures are underway through the Sri Lankan High Commission in Victoria, Seychelles to extradite the arrestees from Madagascar, as Sri Lanka does not have an embassy or a high commission there. Soon after being officially informed of the arrest of the suspects, a group of local law-enforcement authorities comprising an Assistant Superintendent of Police and an Inspector of Police attached to the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) will depart for Madagascar, a senior police officer had commented earlier. Harak Kata who operates his drug syndicate in Dubai, Malaysia, Singapore, Seychelles, the Maldives and Madagascar was previously arrested at the Dubai International Airport in August 2022. However, he had changed his name to Herath Dissanayakage Roshan Isanka in the passport which was found on him at the time of his arrest in Dubai. Dubai Police had released Harak Kata on October 03, 2022 as they were unable to complete the legal matters pertaining to his deportation.",

        "content": "State Minister Shehan Semasinghe has requested the Deputy Speaker of Parliament to instruct relevant authorities not to act on the interim order issued by the Supreme Court regarding the 2023 Local Government polls until the inquiry carried out by the Parliamentary Committee on Privileges comes to an end. Furthermore, he also asked the letter sent to the Finance Minister by the Election Commission Chairman, to be referred to the Parliamentary Committee on Privileges. The state minister made these remarks referring to the issue of privilege raised by MP Premnath C. Dolawatte in parliament recently regarding the Supreme Courts interim order pertaining to the Local Government election. MP Dolawatte on Tuesday (March 07) told the House that the powers and privileges of the parliament have been violated by this interim order. On March 03, upon considering a petition filed by SJBs General Secretary Ranjith Madduma Bandara, a Supreme Court judge bench issued an interim order directing the Secretary to the Finance Ministry and the Attorney General, preventing them from withholding the funds allocated for elections in the budget 2023. Delivering a statement in parliament today, State Minister Semasinghe further noted that the Speaker Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena has accepted the question of breach of privileges raised by MP Dolawatte and that the matter has been presented it to the Committee on Parliamentary Ethics and Privileges. It is a serious offence to implement the interim order of the aforesaid case before hearing the said matter and making a decision, the lawmaker stressed. He added that by tabling the letter of the chairman of the Election Commission, he seeks the Deputy Speaker to refer the same matter to the Committee on Parliamentary Ethics and Privileges to conduct an inquiry. This letter has further breached the privileges of the members of this House. Further, by raising this privilege matter, I request the Deputy Speaker to advise all relevant authorities not to proceed further or take any action on the interim order until the committee concludes its inquiry. Commenting on the privileges matter raised by the government MPs, the opposition raised deep concerns about attempts to pressurize the judiciary and further defer the Local Government election. A heated debate ensued between the lawmakers of the ruling party and the opposition in parliament today over the privileges matter.",

        "date": "March 11, 2023 12:00 pm",
        "content": "The man nominated as Chinas next premier by President Xi Jinping has been formally elected by parliament. Li Qiang is the former Communist Party leader of Chinas biggest city, Shanghai. The 63-year-old received almost every vote from more than 2,900 delegates at the National Peoples Congress. A close ally of President Xi, he is considered a pragmatist and will be tasked with reviving the countrys struggling economy. No reporters were allowed in the room while ballots were cast during a meeting of Chinas rubber-stamp parliament. There was applause as Mr Xi cast his vote. Mr Li received a total of 2,936 votes, with just three delegates voting against his appointment and eight abstaining. He then took an oath, swearing to be loyal to Chinas constitution and to work hard to build a prosperous, strong, democratic, civilised, harmonious and great modern socialist country. Mr Li was President Xis chief of staff in the early 2000s, when Mr Xi was party chief of Zhejiang province. Mr Li was made party secretary of Shanghai in 2017. During the pandemic, he oversaw Shanghais strict lockdown, which led to some residents struggling to access food and medical care. His appointment comes after Mr Xi secured a historic third term as president on Friday. The president has solidified his rule as China reopens from his bruising zero-Covid policy that has fuelled anti-government protests. The country is also facing a falling birth rate that threatens its economic growth engine. The so-called Two Sessions of the National Peoples Congress and the Chinese Peoples Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) this week is closely watched as it provides a glimpse into Chinas direction in the coming years. Since Mao Zedong, leaders in China had been limited to two terms in office. When Mr Xi had this restriction changed in 2018, it transformed him into a figure with a reach not seen since Chairman Mao.

        "content": "A ministerial-level meeting will be held in two weeks to discuss the long-awaited Animal Welfare Bill, the Communications Department of the Parliament says. This was decided at a meeting of the Ministerial Consultative Committee on Agriculture in Parliament, convened on March 07, during which invited guests including Attorney-at-Law Lalani S. Perera commented on the need for this bill. It was noted that the existing laws for animal welfare in Sri Lanka are quite old and they are not strong enough to protect the rights of the animals. The invited guests, pointing out that the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Ordinance passed in 1907 is currently in place for animal welfare in Sri Lanka, underscored that a new animal welfare act should be implemented in line with the new international laws. Although new laws should be made for animal welfare, some Members of Parliament stressed that these laws should not affect the use of animals for agricultural and cultural activities. Accordingly, the committee members said the final draft should be prepared after another round of in-depth discussion on this matter. To this end, it was decided that a meeting of ministerial level be convened in two weeks with the related written requests. During the meeting, Agriculture Minister Mahinda Amaraweera revealed that he has instructed relevant officials to take necessary steps to temporarily suspend the permission to reclaim paddy cultivation lands. Accordingly, reclamation of paddy land can be done only with the special permission of the Ministry. Further, the minister, who assured that all necessary facilities including fertilizers would be provided to make the next Yala Season a success, vowed to provide TSP fertilizer free of charge, urea for Rs. 10,000 or less, and MOP fertilizer at a rate below the current prices for the next season.",

Officers were on site four minutes later, and they were almost immediately joined by special forces. The officers had to break windows to enter the building where about 50 people had gathered. The suspect - described as 35-year-old sports shooter who had a gun licence - had fled to the first floor. His lifeless body was found shortly afterwards. He had managed to shoot nine magazines of ammunition, and 20 more were found in his backpack. German Senator Andy Grote said fast and decisive actions by police officers had saved many lives. He also described the attack as the worst crime in Hamburgs recent history. Police confirmed that they had previously received an anonymous tip-off that raised concerns about the perpetrators mental health. Officers had visited him after the tip-off - but did not have enough grounds to take away his gun at the time. Gregor Miesbach, who filmed the gunman shooting through a first-floor window, told the Bild newspaper: I didnt realise what was happening. I was filming with my phone, and only realised through the zoom that someone was shooting at Jehovahs Witnesses. I heard loud gunshots... I saw a man with a firearm shooting through a window and filmed it, he said. Lara Bauch, a 23-year-old student who lives nearby, told the DPA news agency that there were about four bursts of gunfire - several shots were fired in each burst - with gaps lasting roughly 20 seconds to a minute. She said that from her window she could see a person frantically running from the ground floor to the first floor. The man was wearing dark clothing and moving fast, she added. An alert was sent on the federal warning app, NINAwarn, on Thursday evening telling locals that one or more unknown perpetrators shot at people in a church. Local residents were told not to leave their homes amid the ongoing police operation. Footage showed police escorting people out of the meeting hall, some to ambulances. The reasons behind the shooting were still completely unclear. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz described it as a brutal act of violence, saying his thoughts were with the victims and their relatives. In a statement, the Jehovahs Witness community in Germany said it was deeply saddened by the horrific attack on its members at the Kingdom Hall in Hamburg after a religious service. Forensic experts in white suits worked through the night inside the brightly lit interior of the meeting house. Jehovahs Witnesses are members of a Christian-based religious movement, founded in the US at the end of the 19th Century. In its latest report from 2022, the movement says there are about 8.7 million Jehovahs Witnesses worldwide, including about 170,000 in Germany. In the city of Hamburg, there are believed to be nearly 4,000 members of the organisation. Jehovahs Witnesses are probably best known for their door-to-door evangelical work; witnessing from house to house and offering Bible literature. Although Christian-based, the group believes that the traditional Christian Churches have deviated from the true teachings of the Bible, and do not work in full harmony with God. Germany has some of the strictest gun laws in Europe, including a clause that anyone aged under 25 must pass a psychological evaluation before getting a gun licence. In 2021, there were around one million private gun owners in Germany, according to the National Firearms Registry. They account for 5.7 million legal firearms and firearm parts, most of them owned by hunters. After mass arrests were made last December in relation to a suspected plot to overthrow the government, the German authorities are planning to tighten the countrys gun laws even further.

Speaking on the shared interest of an independent judiciary being amongst several others on which the two countries built their bilateral relations, Chung emphasized the importance of the LG polls, explaining that it gave citizens the ability to advocate directly to the government in partnership with civil society organisations and through qualified legal representation in an independent judiciary. That is why local government elections, we have been discussing, are so critical, she said in this regard. The Ambassador further assured Americas unwavering support for the rights of Sri Lankan citizens to voice their needs peacefully and to participate in their government.

        "title": "Everything Everywhere All at Once sweeps Oscars with seven awards",
        "date": "March 13, 2023 09:29 am",
        "content": "The metaphysical multiverse comedy Everything Everywhere All at Once wrapped its hot dog fingers around Hollywoods top prize Sunday, winning best picture at the 95th Academy Awards, along with awards for Michelle Yeoh, Ke Huy Quan and Jamie Lee Curtis. Though worlds away from Oscar bait, Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinerts anarchic ballet of everything bagels, googly-eyed rocks and one messy tax audit emerged as an improbable Academy Awards heavyweight. The indie hit, A24s second best-picture winner following Moonlight, won seven Oscars in all. Fifty years after The Godfather won at the Oscars, Everything Everywhere All at Once triumphed with a much different immigrant experience. Its eccentric tale about a Chinese immigrant family  just the second feature by the Daniels, as the filmmaking duo is known  blended science fiction and alternate realities in the story of an ordinary woman and laundromat owner. Everything Everywhere, released all the way back in March 2022, helped revive arthouse cinemas after two years of pandemic, racking up more than 100 million in ticket sales. And despite initially scant expectations of Oscar glory, Everything Everywhere All at Once toppled both blockbusters (Top Gun: Maverick, Avatar: The Way of Water) and critical darlings (Tar, The Banshees of Inisherin). Yeoh became the first Asian woman to best actress, taking the award for her lauded performance in Everything Everywhere All at Once. The 60-year-old Malaysian-born Yeoh won her first Oscar for a performance that relied as much on her comic and dramatic chops as it did her kung fu skills. Shes the first best actress win for a non-white actress in 20 years. Ladies, dont let anyone ever tell you youre past your prime, said Yeoh, who received a raucous standing ovation. In winning best director, the Daniels  both 35 years old  won for just their second and decidedly un-Oscar bait feature. Theyre just the third directing pair to win the award, following Robert Wise and Jerome Robbins (West Side Story) and Joel and Ethan Coen (No Country for Old Men). Scheinert dedicated the award to the moms of the world. Best actor went to Brendan Fraser, culminating the former action stars return to center stage for his physical transformation as a 600-lb. reclusive professor in The Whale. The best-actor race had been one of the closest contests of the night, but Fraser in the end edged Austin Butler. So this is what the multiverse looks like, said a clearly moved Fraser, pointing to the Everything Everywhere All at Once crew. The former child star Quan capped his own extraordinary comeback with the Oscar for best supporting actor for his performance in the indie hit Everything Everywhere All at Once. Quan, beloved for his roles as Short Round in Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom and Data in Goonies, had all but given up acting before being cast in Everything Everywhere All at Once. His win, among the most expected of the night, was nevertheless one of the ceremonys most moving moments. The audience  including his Temple of Doom director, Steven Spielberg  gave Quan a standing ovation as he fought back tears. Mom, I just won an Oscar! said Quan, 51, whose family fled Vietnam in the war when he was a child. They say stories like this only happen in the movies. I cant believe its happening, said Quan. This is the American dream. Minutes later, Quans castmate Jamie Lee Curtis won for best supporting actress. Her win, in one of the most competitive categories this year, denied a victory for comic-book fans. Angela Bassett (Black Panther: Wakanda Forever) would have been the first performer to win an Oscar for a Marvel movie. It also made history for Curtis, a first-time winner who alluded to herself as a Nepo baby during her win at the Screen Actors Guild Awards. Shes the rare Oscar winner whose parents were both Oscar nominees, something she emotionally referenced in her speech. Tony Curtis was nominated for The Defiant Ones in 1959 and Janet Leigh was nominated in 1961 for Psycho. Curtis thanked hundreds of people who put her in that position. The German-language WWI epic All Quiet on the Western Front  Netflixs top contender this year  took four awards as the academy heaped honors on the craft of the harrowing anti-war film. It won for cinematography, production design, score and best international film. Though Bassett missed on supporting actress, Ruth E. Carter won for the costume design of Wakanda Forever, four years after becoming the first Black designer to win an Oscar, for Black Panther. This one makes Carter the first Black woman to win two Oscars. Thank you to the Academy for recognizing the superhero that is a Black woman, said Carter. She endures, she loves, she overcomes, she is every woman in this film. Carter dedicated the award to her mother, who she said died last week at 101. The telecast, airing live on ABC, opened traditionally: with a montage of the years films (with Kimmel edited into a cockpit in Top Gun: Maverick) and a lengthy monologue. Kimmel, hosting for the third time, didnt dive right into revisiting Will Smiths slap of Chris Rock at last years ceremony. The late-night comedian struggled to find lessons from last years incident, which was followed by Smith winning best actor. If anyone tried any violence this year, Kimmel said, you will be awarded the Oscar for best actor and permitted to give a 19-minute-long speech. But Kimmel, hosting for the third time, said anyone who wanted to get jiggy with it this year will have to come through a fearsome battalion of bodyguards, including Michael B. Jordan, Michelle Yeoh, Steven Spielberg and his shows security guard Guillermo Rodriguez. After landmark wins for Chloé Zhao (Nomadland) and Jane Campion (The Power of the Dog), no women were nominated for best director. Sarah Polley, though, won best adapted screenplay for the metaphor-rich Mennonite drama Women Talking. Thank you to the academy for not being mortally offended by the words women and talking, said Polley. Daniel Rohers Navalny, about the imprisoned Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny, took best documentary. The films win came with clear overtones to Navalnys ongoing imprisonment and Vladimir Putins continued war in Ukraine. Yulia Navalnaya joined the filmmakers on the stage. My husband is in prison just for telling the truth, said Navalnaya. Stay strong my love. Some big names werent in attendance for other reasons. Neither Tom Cruise, whose Top Gun: Maverick is up for best picture, nor James Cameron, director of best-picture nominee Avatar: The Way of Water, were at the ceremony. Both have been forefront in Hollywoods efforts to get moviegoers back after years of pandemic. The two guys who asked us to go back to theater arent in the theater, said Kimmel, who added that Cruise without his shirt on in Top Gun: Maverick was L. Ron Hubba Hubba. After last years Oscars, which had stripped some categories from being handed out in the live telecast, the academy restored all awards to the show and leaned on traditional song and and dance numbers. That meant some show-stopping numbers, including the elastic suspenders dance of Naatu Naatu from the Telugu action-film sensation RRR, an intimate, impassioned performance by Lady Gaga of Hold My Hand from Top Gun: Maverick, and an Super Bowl follow-up by Rihanna. Best song went to Naatu Naatu. It also meant a long show. This kind of makes you miss the slapping a little bit, right? Kimmel said mid-show. The nights first award went to Guillermo del Toros Pinocchio for best animated film. That handed Netflix its first Oscar in the category. After last years slap, the academy created a crisis management team to better respond to surprises. Neither Rock, who recently made his most forceful statement about the incident in a live special, nor Smith, who was banned by the academy for 10 years, attended. The Academy Awards is attempting to recapture some of its old luster. One thing working in its favor: This years best picture field was stacked with blockbusters. Ratings usually go up when the nominees are more popular, which certainly goes for Top Gun: Maverick and Avatar: The Way of Water. Neither won much, though. The Way of Water, with more than 2.28 billion in box office, won for best visual effects. The Top Gun sequel (1.49 billion), took best sound. Last year, Apple TVs CODA became the first streaming movie to win best picture. But this year, nine of the 10 best picture nominees were theatrical releases. After the movie business cratered during the pandemic, moviegoing recovered to about 67 of pre-pandemic levels. But it was an up and down year, full of smash hits and anxiety-inducing lulls in theaters. This year, ticket sales have been strong thanks to releases like Creed III and Cocaine Bear  which made not one but two cameos at Sundays show. But there remain storm clouds on the horizon. The Writers Guild and the major studios are set to begin contract negotiations March 20, a looming battle that has much of the industry girding for the possibility of a work stoppage throughout film and television. The Oscars, too, are seeking steadiness. Last years telecast drew 16.6 million viewers, a 58 increase from the scaled-down 2021 edition, watched by a record low 10.5 million.

        "date": "March 13, 2023 11:01 am",
        "content": "More employees of many crucial sectors including health, ports and banking will step up their trade union actions from today (March 13), in protest of the conduct of the government. The trade union collective of professionals recently flashed a red light, threatening to bolster their actions this week to urge the government to reduce the heavy taxation, electricity tariffs and interest rates. Multiple trade unions representing many sectors engaged in protests and strikes last week, unaccompanied by the Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA). However, the GMOA members are on strike at a number of hospitals across the country from today, in support of the ongoing trade union actions of professionals. Accordingly, the government medical officers have launched a token strike from 8.00 a.m. this morning at all hospitals in Western, Southern, Central and Eastern provinces, GMOAs media spokesperson according to Dr. Chamil Wijesinghe. In addition, the All-Ceylon Nurses Union, Joint Trade Union Alliance of the National Water Supply and Drainage Board (NWSDB), All-Ceylon General Ports Employees Union, Ceylon Bank Employees Union, Government and Semi-Government Trade Union Collective and the Trade Union Collective of Teachers and Principals are also expected to kick off protests and strikes this week. Meanwhile, the members of the Ceylon Bank Employees Union have reported to work clad in black to express their dissatisfaction with the conduct of the government. Against this backdrop, the ports authority employees have decided to engage in a work-to-rule action for 48 hours from today. The convenor of National Trade Union Coordination Centre, Wasantha Samarasinghe meanwhile, said they are planning to launch an island-wide strike on March 15 if the government fails to respond positively to their demands. Commenting on the matter, State Minister Tharaka Balasuriya took issue with the ongoing trade union actions. He noted that staging strikes and protests as Sri Lanka is closing in on unlocking the USD 2.9 billion IMF bailout package and the tourism sector is seeing an improvement with the increasing number of tourist arrivals could disrupt the recovery process and bring the country to a standstill.",

The Sri Lankan president also acknowledged President Xis accomplished leadership, under which he said China has overcome challenges and made great progress. He also expressed confidence that President Xis third term in office will undoubtedly open new vistas for China. In his congratulatory message, President Wickremesinghe highlighted the centuries-long and exceptional bond of solidarity and mutual understanding between Sri Lanka and China. While appreciating the steadfast assistance extended by China during the economic challenges facing Sri Lanka, Wickremesinghe was, in particular, thankful for the financial assurances given by the Export-Import (EXIM) Bank of China, paving way for the final stage to secure a USD 2.9 billion bailout package under the International Monetary Funds Extended Fund Facility (EFF). The President also expressed confidence that during President Xis new term in Office, the existing robust cooperation between the two countries will continue to flourish for the mutual benefit of the people of both countries. Further, the Sri Lankan leader conveyed his heartfelt well wishes for President Xis personal welfare, as well as the ongoing success and prosperity of the amicable citizens of the Peoples Republic of China. Xi Jinping on Friday (March 10) secured a precedent-breaking third five-year term as the president of the Peoples Republic of China while tightening his grip as the countrys most powerful leader since Mao Zedong. Nearly 3,000 members of Chinas rubber-stamp parliament, the National Peoples Congress (NPC), voted unanimously in the Great Hall of the People for Xi, 69, to be president in an election where there was no other candidate. The voting lasted for about an hour and the electronic counting was completed in about 15 minutes. The stage was set for another Xi term when he did away with presidential term limits in 2018. His power was already extended last October when he was reconfirmed for another five years as general secretary of the central committee of the ruling Communist Party. -with input from agencies",

        "content": "His Eminence the Archbishop of Colombo, Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith has taken issue with the attempts of government MPs to postpone the elections by deeming the Supreme Court order on the Local Government elections as a breach of parliamentary privileges. Speaking to reporters at the Bishop House in Colombo this morning (March 13), Cardinal Ranjith referred to the interim order issued by a Supreme Court judge bench on March 03, preventing the Finance Ministrys Secretary and the Attorney General from withholding the funds allocated for elections in the budget 2023. Later, a privilege issue was raised by MP Premnath C. Dolawatte in the parliament, alleging that the powers and privileges of the parliament have been violated by the interim order. On Friday (March 10), State Minister Shehan Semasinghe also backed the privilege issue raised by MP Dolawatte, and requested the Deputy Speaker of Parliament to instruct relevant authorities not to act on the interim order until the inquiry conducted by the Parliamentary Committee on Privileges concludes. Semasinghe stated that is a serious offence to implement the interim order of the aforesaid case before hearing the said matter and a decision is made by the Privileges Committee. Commenting in this regard, Cardinal Ranjith stressed that the conduct of these MPs is unacceptable, slamming it as a huge blow to the sovereignty and the dignity of the law. Speaking further, Cardinal Ranjith emphasized that no one can interfere with the judiciary matters under the pretext of privilege issues. He also urged the President, the Government and the Parliament to comply with the Supreme Courts interim order.",

The diplomatic notes were exchanged by the Indian High Commissioner to Sri Lanka, Gopal Baglay and Minister of Water Supply  Estate Infrastructure Development, Jeevan Thondaman.

Nearly 46,000 houses have been built in different parts of Sri Lanka under the first two phases of IHP. The next phase for the construction of 10,000 houses in plantation areas, announced by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is expected to commence soon. Exchange of diplomatic notes takes place at an important juncture when the Indian-Origin Tamil community who are concentrated in the plantation areas marks 200 years of their arrival to Sri Lanka, the Indian High Commission said further in its statement. This also coincides with 100 years of establishment of the Assistant High Commission of India in Kandy, which has been instrumental in implementing several people-centric grant schemes by the Indian government for the Indian-Origin Tamil community cutting across areas such as education, health, vocational training, livelihood development and several others, in addition to housing.
