        "title": "Indias opposition jubilant as Modi critic Kejriwal gets bail to campaign in elections",
        "date": "May 11, 2024 09:09 pm",
        "content": "Indias top court gave temporary bail to Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal in a graft case on Friday, allowing him to campaign in the ongoing general elections, boosting the opposition alliance of which he is a prominent figure. The Supreme Court said Kejriwal - a fierce critic of Prime Minister Narendra Modi - would be out on bail until June 1, the last day of the nationwide seven-phase vote, and would have to return to pre-trial detention on June 2. India began voting on April 19 and elections for more than half of the 543 seats in parliament have now been completed following the third phase of the vote on May 7. The two areas governed by Kejriwals Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) - the National Capital Territory that includes New Delhi, and the northern state of Punjab - go to the polls on May 25 and June 1 respectively. Votes will be counted on June 4 and results are expected to be announced the same day. It feels good to be back among you, Kejriwal, dressed in a dark collarless T-shirt, told supporters through the sun-roof of a vehicle soon after being released from Delhis Tihar jail. Thousands of AAP supporters had gathered waving the partys yellow and blue flags, setting off firecrackers, shouting slogans and distributing sweets. I have only one request for you, we have to come together to save the country from dictatorship, Kejriwal said. I am fighting with everything I have against this dictatorship. But 1.4 billion people will have to fight dictatorship, he said, referring to Indias huge population. The court had said last week that it may consider granting Kejriwal temporary bail because of the elections while it heard an appeal against his arrest, as that hearing could take a while to conclude. Opposition parties have accused Prime Minister Narendra Modis government of using investigative agencies to hurt its rivals, which the government denies. Over the years Kejriwal has accused Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) of damaging democracy, promoting corruption, throttling governance in Delhi, abusing their power and attacking the federal structure of the constitution among other things. ARRESTED BJP spokesperson Shazia Ilmi said the party has always respected the verdicts of the highest court. Kejriwal will not be able to play the victim card. He cant say that he is being discriminated against, that all the agencies and courts are against him, she told ANI news agency, in which Reuters has a minority stake. Secondly, and importantly, he has got interim bail, not freedom. He has to go back to jail on June 2, Ilmi added. The Enforcement Directorate, Indias financial crime-fighting agency, arrested Kejriwal on March 21 in connection with corruption allegations related to the capital territorys liquor policy. Kejriwals government and his AAP have denied the allegations. Modi and BJP say the investigating agencies are only doing their job and the government is not influencing them. Kejriwal has been in pre-trial detention since April 1, and his wife Sunita has stepped in to campaign for his decade-old party which has been hobbled by the detention also of two other senior leaders in the same case. Members of the INDIA alliance of more than two dozen opposition parties - Modis main challenger which includes the AAP - said they were pleased that Kejriwal had received bail. Mamata Banerjee, chief minister of the eastern state of West Bengal and a key INDIA member, said she was very happy Kejriwal got bail. It will be very helpful in the context of the current elections, she posted on X. Abhishek Manu Singhvi, Kejriwals lawyer, had argued that Kejriwal was arrested just before the vote to stop him from campaigning against Modi, who opinion polls suggest will win a comfortable majority and secure a rare third straight term. ED lawyers argued that giving bail to a politician just to campaign risked sending the message that there were different standards for such figures compared with other citizens.

        "date": "May 12, 2024 02:02 pm",
        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe emphasised that Rs. 01 billion will be allocated next year for research on the relationship between Buddhas teachings and Artificial Intelligence (AI). The President mentioned that while the research on Buddhas teachings and AI was scheduled to begin this year, it has been postponed to next year due to the absence of required legislation for the regulation of Artificial Intelligence. He emphasized that the subsequent steps will be taken once the new laws are adopted. President Ranil Wickremesinghe made this statement during his attendance at the 100th anniversary celebration of the Sri Lanka Buddhist Society Moratuwa, held on Saturday (11) at the Moratuwa Buddhist Society Hall. The Moratuwa Buddhist Society Hall, initiated under the Sri Lanka Buddhist Society Moratuwa, had its foundation stone laid in 1925. This society was established on May 11, 1924, under the leadership of Mr. Arthur V. Dias. The building was inaugurated as the Buddhist Headquarters for Buddhist population in Moratuwa on June 24, 1929, by the then Governor of British Ceylon Sir Herbert J. Stanley with officiating the opening ceremony. Additionally, on that same day, the foundation stone for Moratuwa College was also laid. The President reiterated that the government will finance the restoration of the Moratuwa Buddhist Society Hall, which is approaching its centenary. During his visit to the Moratuwa Buddhist Society Hall this afternoon, President Ranil Wickremesinghe participated in solemn religious ceremonies before the sacred Buddha statue. The Maha Sangha meticulously adorned the Seth Pirith and extended blessings to the President. Additionally, the President participated in the ceremonial planting of a sandalwood tree on the premises, symbolizing the commemoration of the 100th anniversary of the Moratuwa Buddhist Society. The Vice President of Moratuwa Buddhist Society Dhammika Chandranath Fernando presented the centenary commemorative souvenir to President Ranil Wickremesinghe. Additionally, the most senior member of the Moratuwa Buddhist Society Ranjith Gamanayake, along with Vice Presidents Pradeep Sriyantha Fernando, Dhammika Chandranath Fernando, Gamini Perera, and Regional Secretary Keerthi Perera, also presented a commemorative gift to the President. Furthermore, commemorative gifts were extended to Minister of Justice, Prison Affairs and Constitutional Reforms Wijayadasa Rajapaksa, Member of Parliament Eran Wickramaratne, Senior Advisor to the President on National Security  Chief of Presidential Staff Sagala Ratnayaka and former Mayor of Moratuwa Samanlal Fernando. Additionally, a picture of the Moratuwa Buddhist Society Hall, featuring a portrait of President Ranil Wickremesinghe painted by W. A. Imasha Shavindra Ashinshana a student from the Moratuwa College student, was also presented to the President. President Ranil Wickremesinghe, speaking at the event, added: Today, the world is confronted with a significant threat posed by climate change. The unprecedented intensity of sunlight were experiencing is unlike anything weve encountered before. We find ourselves in a challenging situation that requires focused efforts to mitigate climate warming. Additionally, were grappling with a substantial water scarcity issue. Its essential to approach these challenges in alignment with the teachings of Buddha. In the next two or three decades, climate change will emerge as one of the primary global challenges. According to Buddhas teachings, this issue stems from civilizations greed for rapid progress. The widespread desire for advancement has led to increased vehicle usage, resulting in significant environmental damage. Consequently, human society has inflicted considerable harm on the environment. Hence, its crucial to prioritize efforts to control climate change. Today, the world is witnessing rapid technological advancements. Despite initial beliefs after the atomic bomb explosion in 1945 that technological progress might cease, there has been significant advancement across all sectors. Particularly, the IT sector has seen remarkable progress. During our school days, computers and mobile phones were non-existent, but with modern technological advancements, we now have access to Artificial Intelligence. We are currently at the dawn of Artificial Intelligence, prompting questions about its trajectory over the next two decades. Its essential to explore the relationship between artificial intelligence and Buddhism. Buddhas teachings emphasize the power of our minds in shaping our lives. By mastering our minds, we pave the way for progress; failure to do so leaves us with no future. This message was specifically intended for humanity, highlighting the importance of controlling our minds to overcome desires. Now, artificial intelligence (AI) mirrors the capabilities of the human mind. AI can process vast amounts of information and operate accordingly. Therefore, its pertinent to explore the connection between Buddhas teachings and AI, considering their shared focus on the minds control and its implications for our actions. If artificial intelligence promotes a different religion, it could pose a threat to Buddhism, so its crucial to consider this possibility. Throughout history, Buddhism in Sri Lanka has been influenced by Hinduism, Mahayana and political influences. With the emergence of artificial intelligence, it adds another layer of influence. Therefore, we must contemplate whether AI might propagate alternative doctrines. Its essential for people to contemplate the implications of integrating Dhamma with the mobile devices they use. This issue extends beyond Buddhism to other religions as well. Hence, we are implementing new regulations to oversee artificial intelligence. The Ministry of Technology has drafted legislation for technology development, including plans to establish an artificial intelligence centre. Countries like the United Kingdom and the European Union have already enacted laws to govern artificial intelligence, and we must follow suit. Moreover, there are plans to allocate LKR 01 Billion next year for research on the interconnection between Buddhas teachings and artificial intelligence. Although originally slated for this year, the initiative has been deferred to next year due to pending laws and regulations concerning AI oversight. Consequently, we anticipate introducing new legislation to kick-start these endeavours. This event was graced by the Maha Sangharathna including Venerable Magalle Nagitha Thero the Chief incumbent of the Moratuwella Dhamma Niketana International Buddhist Centre and Amarapura Kalyanivamsika Sri Saddhamma Justice Sect, Venerable Ariyagnana Thero the Panadura Sangha Council Judicial Sangha leader and the Chief incumbent of Koralawella Walukarama Maha Viharaya, Venerable Gampola Sugunadhaja Thero the Chairman of the Moratuwa Shasanarakshaka Bala Mandalaya and the Chief incumbent of Moratuwa Indibedda Sri Sudharma Ratnarama Viharaya, Shasthrapathi Venerable Udugama Wimalakitthi Thero the Chief incumbent of Moratuwa Horetuduwa Purana Sanghikarama Vihara and Angulane Gnanavimala Buddhist Centre, other religious priests and a large number of people including members of Sri Lanka Buddhist Society Moratuwa. --PMD--",

        "date": "May 12, 2024 05:58 pm",
        "content": "Issuing a statement addressing the growing concerns over the governments plans to sell off national assets and state-owned enterprises (SOEs), former President Mahinda Rajapaksa has states that these actions of the government have given rise to discontent among trade unions, political parties and the general public. Rajapaksa emphasized his administrations stance of not selling a single state-owned enterprise during his tenure as President. He pointed out that instead of privatization, his government focused on re-acquiring some previously sold enterprises, such as the Insurance Corporation and Lanka Hospitals, which continue to yield profits for the state. My government had a pragmatic approach towards state owned assets and enterprises. If a state-owned enterprise was making profits and providing a good service to the public, we saw no reason to privatize it. At times, a government may take a strategic decision to manage the prices of certain goods or services produced by state-owned enterprises for the overall benefit of the economy or to help low-income earnersThere is no government in the world that does not subsidise certain earmarked economic activities, Rajapaksa stated. Highlighting the importance of transparency and national security in any restructuring process, the former President stressed the need for maximum consultation with employees and adherence to a national plan. However, Rajapaksa also stressed that trade unions adopt a nuanced approach, recognizing that not all private sector involvement in state-owned enterprises should be opposed. He emphasized the potential benefits of private sector participation in revitalizing underperforming enterprises or investing in new projects. Going by the dictionary definition of privatization, any involvement of the private sector in the ownership structure or the control of a state-owned asset or enterprise can be characterized as privatization. However, trade unions should not oppose every attempt to obtain foreign or private sector investment in a government-owned enterprise. A pragmatic and non-dogmatic approach to such matters is required, the statement mentioned. Rajapaksa cautioned against ideologically driven privatization efforts, noting that extreme positions from both political parties and trade unions could be harmful to the countrys interests. Trade unions should regard proposals to obtain private or foreign participation in a state-owned enterprise on a case-by-case basis and look at the overall benefit of such collaboration to the country. The only real way national assets and strategically important state-owned enterprises can be safeguarded is by having a government that takes a pragmatic and non-dogmatic approach to such matters. This is why it is important to take note of the fact that when I ruled the country for more than nine years, the economy flourished and there was not even a discussion on the subject of privatization, he added. With the current government in an interim arrangement until the next presidential election, Rajapaksa proposed postponing any sale of state-owned assets until a new government is formed. He argued that this would allow the incoming administration to handle such matters in line with its electoral mandate.",

Reflecting on past economic instability, the President recounted how a coalition government was formed, transcending party lines, to steer the country towards recovery. He emphasized the success of this approach and urged unity in embracing the future economic agenda through the adoption of new laws. President Ranil Wickremesinghe underscored the imperative of allocating substantial funds for education and healthcare in the future, affirming that this could only be achieved through the implementation of the new economic program. International Nurses Day is observed annually on 12th May to honor the birth of the Founder of Modern Nursing, Lady Florence Nightingale. This years theme, Our Nurses  Our Future, The Economic Power of Nursing, underscores the pivotal role nurses play in shaping our collective future. Simultaneously, the President inaugurated the Sri Lanka Nursing University, unveiling its commemorative plaque through digital technology. Prime Minister Dinesh Gunawardena launched the official website of the State Service Nurses Association. Further speaking on the occasion, President Ranil Wickremesinghe added: Today is a very special day. Today, we commemorate the birthday of the Pioneer of Nursing, Florence Nightingale following established a nursing university. The inception of this university is attributed to the unwavering dedication of our esteemed Venerable Dr. Muruththettuwe Ananda Nayaka Thero, following an energetic battle. However, we have triumphed in accomplishing this feat. These universities can be initiated within existing structures and subsequently improved upon. This university stands as a keystone in the life journey of Venerable Dr. Muruththettuwe Ananda Nayaka Thero. Besides nursing, it is imperative that these institutions also incorporate foreign language education. Proficiency in languages such as English, German, Japanese, Korean, and Chinese should be imparted here. Equipped with this linguistic knowledge, nurses can explore service opportunities in foreign countries. Particularly in countries like England and Germany, there is a prevalence of elderly care facilities. Furthermore, there is a growing interest in such investment ventures within Sri Lanka. Hence, this issue bears significant importance. Today, the focus was on safeguarding the Treasury, a reminder of Alagiyawanna Mohottalas Battle of Constantine where they faced encirclement like Dasa. Despite the challenges, our imperative remains the protection of our financial resources as we forge ahead. Amidst this, our efforts have been directed towards extending concessions to government employees wherever feasible. Additionally, our sights are set on elevating salaries in the coming year. The past four years have been marked by profound adversity. Economic transformation only commenced in the last two quarters of the previous year following a prolonged stagnation since 2020, aggravated by both economic turmoil and the COVID-19 pandemic. Also, the nation grappled with a severe malnutrition crisis, particularly affecting orphaned children, stunting their growth and portending future difficulties. Recognizing the urgency, we mobilized resources, engaging with the World Bank to secure triple the usual Samurdhi relief for the populace. Alongside, the group of beneficiaries expanded from 1.8 million to 2.4 million. Consequently, significant allocations were directed towards addressing this critical issue. Additionally, we recognized the challenges faced by government employees and took steps to grant them a salary increase of Rs.10, 000. This action sent a clear signal for the potential elevation of salaries in both the private and plantation sectors. In the last Yala, Maha seasons, we achieved success in our harvest. Similar to previous Sinhala and Tamil New Year seasons, these earnings will circulate back into the social economy during the upcoming Vesak festival. In this context, I am optimistic about our ability to achieve a 03 economic growth next year. Accordingly, our focus has once again shifted towards increasing the salaries of government employees. I extend my sincere gratitude to the United Nurses Association for their understanding and support in this matter. Looking ahead, I anticipate further economic progress in the country next year. Without fostering this economic growth, achieving our goals will become challenging. At present, we cannot print money. We have reached an agreement with the IMF, committing to refrain from printing money. Hence, our sole recourse is to strengthen our economic growth rate. Currently, we are in the final stages of negotiations with countries where we have borrowed from, with forthcoming discussions slated with private creditors. This trajectory positions us to avert bankruptcy by the end of this year. However, our economic challenges persist beyond this immediate hurdle. Even with potential loan waivers, outstanding balances must be settled. Moreover, we engaged in the negotiations with the World Bank and the IMF to renovate our economic structure. The transition from an import-centric to an export-driven economy is imperative, and we have accepted to these conditions. Retreat from this course would expose the concessions we have secured. Thus, we are compelled to proceed in this direction. It is imperative that we consistently maintain a budget surplus. If not we will fails to pay debt. It must be mentioned that all these decisions were made the betterment of the country. Now, we have to do is move forward along with an export-driven economy. To facilitate this transition, we have formulated a set of laws. While some have been enacted, others are still pending. Foremost among these measures is the enactment of the Central Bank Law, which prohibits money printing and borrowing from state banks while granting autonomy to the Central Bank. Additionally, three other laws have been drafted. The Public Debt Management Act has been proposed thus far. This legislation sets limits on borrowing, stipulating conditions for loan acquisition and repayment in accordance with specified criteria. Moreover, we have introduced the State Finance Bill. Previously, financial regulation was overseen by the Fiscal Responsibility Act (FR), but now our focus is on legislating financial control. This new law will govern the management of government funds, revenue collection, and monetary distribution, shaping our financial landscape for the future. We are presenting it to the approval of the Cabinet. We have already established the Budget Office of the Parliament, alongside an independent agency tasked with providing impartial reports to the Parliament. Both entities operate within the framework of these two laws. Additionally, we are proposing the enactment of the Economic Transformation Law, aiming to transition our economy towards a new economy centered on exports. This legislation incorporates the terms agreed upon with the IMF and other countries into law. I urge all parties to support the adoption of this law, as the future prosperity of our country hinges upon it. Today, there is a critical need to allocate a huge fund to boost our healthcare sector. The elderly population has increased and we have to do a vital to combat malnutrition. So it is urgent to make a rapid economic development. Our government was formed through collaboration across various political parties, united in our mission to rebuild our country. Today, we have achieved that goal. Now, we are poised to introduce three key laws essential for propelling our country forward, with a debate scheduled for June. I believe consensus will be reached on these laws, as no viable alternatives have been proposed. Therefore, I request everyone to embrace these new laws and advance our countrys development agenda. Furthermore, significant investment is required for education and healthcare, which can only be sustained through the implementation of this new economic framework. Hence, I implore all of you to lend your support to this program. Prime Minister Dinesh Gunawardena; Today holds special significance for us, especially with the presence of the President, making it even more memorable. This occasion has been organized by the Public Services United Nurses Union. It is essential to acknowledge that the nursing service, pioneered by Lady Nightingale, expresses a noble concept that provides crucial aid to individuals facing crises. The practice of nursing is universally revered for its contribution to society. This day is commemorated with respect due to the trust it instills both locally and internationally. People place immense confidence in nurses, knowing they will receive the necessary care to return home healthy. Nurses shoulder significant responsibilities during critical times, earning them widespread admiration. Consequently, a large number of individuals come together to celebrate this remarkable day, signifying the insightful impact of nursing services across various domains in our country. The current Health Minister has been instrumental in providing unwavering support for this cause, while the President has played a pivotal role in advancing it further. After widespread discussions, a nursing university has been established. This significant achievement is attributed to the dedication of Venerable Dr. Muruththettuwe Ananda Nayaka Thero and the decisive action taken by President Ranil Wickremesinghe. The Minister of Health and officials from the relevant ministries played instrumental roles in this endeavor. I extend my heartfelt gratitude to the entire nursing community, whose tireless efforts have culminated in this momentous occasion. Minister of Industries and Health Dr. Ramesh Pathirana; As I mark my sixth month as the Health Minister, this month, I reflect with humble satisfaction on the progress achieved for the nursing service, which is Sri Lankas largest and most esteemed professional group in the healthcare sector. Guided by the Honorable President, Sri Lanka has witnessed the establishment of its first Nursing University. Additionally, the position of Deputy Director General has been inaugurated, marking a significant step forward. Despite navigating through economic challenges, there is a gradual alleviation of the hardships we faced. In 2024, the President extended an allowance to the entire public service of Sri Lanka. In recognition of the exemplary service rendered by the nursing fraternity in our healthcare sector, we have gone a step further by enhancing the uniform allowance. Furthermore, I am pleased to announce that your special duty allowance will be doubled from May. Over 150,000 individuals are serving in the Sri Lankan Healthcare Service. Amidst the backdrop of various accusations leveled against politicians and public servants in the country, its a source of great pride and respect that such allegations have not stained the reputation of the nursing service in Sri Lanka. This stands as a testament to the excellence of nursing. Each prevailed government has consistently allocated a considerable portion of funds towards healthcare service and free education annually. Notably, the largest allocation of funds, totaling Rs.410 billion, was earmarked for the health service in the year 2024. Furthermore, it is worth acknowledging the significant contributions of Venerable Dr. Muruththettuwe Ananda Nayaka Thero towards advancing nursing service. His efforts have yielded considerable gains for the nursing profession, all achieved without any struggle. Chancellor of Colombo University, Chairman of Public Services United Nurses Union, Chief Incumbent of the Western Province Venerable Dr. Muruththettuwe Ananda Nayaka Thero; Today, as we celebrate International Nurses Day on the occasion of Lady Nightingales birthday, I call upon all nurses to follow her path. While faced with temptations to engage in struggles, I assert that we have already achieved significant victories. Our focus now should be on safeguarding these gains. Let us diligently fulfill our duties and advocate for salary increments. Despite any challenges that may arise, I urge everyone to uphold the dignity of the noble nursing profession. Let us secure our rights through negotiation rather than through conflict. The establishment of a nursing university stands as a monumental achievement, marking a historic victory for nursing. It is imperative that we never forget this victory. I would like to acknowledge President Ranil Wickremesinghe, who, as Deputy Prime Minister at the time, presented diploma certificates to nurses. Today, he has been appointed Deputy Director, a fitting recognition of his contributions. These rights stem from the unwavering resolve of our President amidst adversity. Those who seek to undermine them aim not for victory. It is crucial to acknowledge our accessible leaders  the President, Prime Minister, and Minister  with whom we can address any issue. Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, State Minister for Indigenous Medicine Sisira Jayakody, Parliamentarians Wajira Abeywardana and Yadamini Gunawardena, Secretary to the Ministry of Health Dr. Palitha Maheepala, Secretary of the Government Medical Officers Association Dr. Haritha Aluthge, officials from the Ministry of Health, principals of Nursing Colleges, Nursing Officers, retired Nursing Officers, and guests were present at the event. --PMD--",

        "date": "May 13, 2024 01:05 am",
        "content": "(Reuters) - Flash floods caused by heavy rains have devastated villages in northern Afghanistan, killing 315 people and injuring more than 1,600, authorities said on Sunday, as villagers buried their dead and aid agencies warned of widening havoc. Thousands of homes were damaged and livestock wiped out, the Taliban-run refugee ministry said, while aid groups warned of damage to health care facilities and vital infrastructure, such as water supply, with streets left coated in mud. In the Nahrin district of Baghlan province, people carried their shrouded dead to a gravesite. We have no food, no drinking water, no shelter, no blankets, nothing at all, floods have destroyed everything, said Muhammad Yahqoob, who has lost 13 members of his family, children among them. The survivors were struggling to cope, he added. Out of 42 houses, only two or three remain, it has destroyed the entire valley. In a statement, the Talibans economy minister, Din Mohammad Hanif, urged the United Nations, humanitarian agencies and private business to provide support for those hit by the floods. Lives and livelihoods have been washed away, said Arshad Malik, the Afghanistan director for Save the Children. The flash floods tore through villages, sweeping away homes and killing livestock. He estimated that 310,000 children lived in the worst-hit districts, adding, Children have lost everything. The refugee ministry said Sundays latest tally of dead and injured came from its Baghlan provincial office, according to a post on X. Earlier, the interior ministry had put the toll from Fridays floods at 153, but warned it could rise. Afghanistan is prone to natural disasters and the United Nations considers it one of countries most vulnerable to climate change. It has battled a shortfall in aid after the Taliban took over as foreign forces withdrew in 2021, since development aid that formed the backbone of government finances was cut. That has worsened in subsequent years as foreign governments grapple with competing global crises and growing condemnation of the Talibans curbs on Afghan women. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "date": "May 13, 2024 10:06 am",
        "content": "Switzerland on Saturday won the Eurovision Song Contest 2024 in Swedish host city Malmo, beating runner-up Croatia, after having been among bookmakers top-three to win the competition. Billed as a feel-good celebration of European diversity, this years contest has been thrust into the political spotlight with calls for Israel to be excluded over its military campaign in Gaza, triggered by Hamas deadly attack on Oct. 7 in Israel. Swiss rapper and singer Nemo, 24, won the contest with The Code, a drum-and-bass, opera, rap and rock song, about Nemos journey of self-discovery as a non-binary person. I hope this contest can live up to its promise and continue to stand for peace and dignity for every person in this world, Nemo said, after receiving the Eurovision trophy on stage. To know that a song that has changed my life and a song where I just speak about my story has touched so many people and maybe inspired other people to stay true to their story is the most insane thing that has ever happened to me, Nemo later said during a press conference. Nemos Eurovision triumph was the third for Switzerland, and the first since Canadian star Celine Dion won singing for the Alpine country in 1988 with Ne Partez Pas Sans Moi. Cheers of joy broke out in bars in central Zurich when the winner was announced, and Swiss revellers sang along as Nemo tore through a victory rendition of The Code. I think its just great, Nemo is fantastic, said Maha Nater, a 24-year-old kindergarten worker celebrating the win in the city after watching the marathon contest. One karaoke bar began blasting out Queens We Are The Champions as patrons joined in. Nemos victory would blaze a trail for others who had had to cope with prejudice against non-binary people, said Nater. It sets an example to follow, she said. Croatias Baby Lasagna, real name Marko Purisic, 28, came second with Rim Tim Tagi Dim, a song about a young man who leaves home aspiring to become a city boy with better opportunities. Israels Eden Golan, 20, finished fifth in the contest despite demonstrators calls for a boycott of the country. The female solo artist on Thursday emerged as one of the leading contenders to win after qualifying for the final. Booing was heard during Golans performance but also applause, a Reuters photographer in the auditorium said. The noise was partly audible in the broadcast viewed by tens of millions of people in Europe and around the world. There was also booing when the points of the Israeli jury were presented. Several thousand protesters gathered in central Malmo ahead of Saturdays final, waving Palestinian flags and shouting Eurovision united by genocide - a twist on the contests official slogan United by music. A few hundred people later also protested outside the venue, chanting Eurovision, you cant hide, youre supporting genocide. Protesters have been pointing to double standards as the European Broadcasting Union banned Russia from Eurovision in 2022 because of its invasion of Ukraine. Police hauled away some protesters before surrounding and ushering them away, a Reuters reporter outside the arena said. Some protesters were seen lying on the ground after police used pepper spray to disband the demonstration. Twenty-five countries competed in the final after Dutch artist Joost Klein was expelled earlier on Saturday due to a complaint filed by a production crew member. Viewer votes made up half of Saturdays final result, while juries of five music professionals in each participating country made up the other half. The Eurovision winner is awarded the contests official glass trophy, which is shaped like a classic, old-fashioned microphone, with sand blasted and painted details. The winner also gets to host the competition the following year. Nemo broke the fragile prize shortly after receiving it, but was given a new one to replace it. I didnt just break the code, I also broke the trophy, Nemo said, laughing, at the press conference after the win. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "date": "May 13, 2024 10:31 am",
        "content": "The number of people killed by flash floods and cold lava flow from a volcano in western Indonesia over the weekend has risen to 41 with 17 more missing, a local disaster agency official told AFP Monday. Hours of heavy rain caused large volcanic rocks to roll down one of Indonesias most active volcanos into two districts on Sumatra island Saturday evening, while flooding inundated roads, homes and mosques. Data as of last night, we recorded 37 dead victims... But from this morning it has grown again, the figure reached 41 (dead), Ilham Wahab, West Sumatra disaster mitigation agency official, told AFP. Rescuers were searching for 17 still missing, three in Agam district and 14 in Tanah Datar, both the worst-hit areas of the flood and home to hundreds of thousands of people, he said. Ilham could not confirm the number of locals evacuated because officials had encouraged people to evacuate to relatives places, which are safer than tent shelters in heavy rains. We are focused on first, searching and rescuing the victims, second, protecting the evacuees, protecting the vulnerable people, he said. Roads in the districts were turned into rivers, with mosques and houses damaged. Heavy rains inundated neighbourhoods with muddy flood waters and swept vehicles into a nearby river, while volcanic ash and large rocks rumbled down Mount Marapi. Cold lava, also known as lahar, is volcanic material such as ash, sand and pebbles carried down a volcanos slopes by rain. Have mercy Authorities sent a team of rescuers and rubber boats to look for the missing victims and to transport people to shelters. The local government set up evacuation centres and emergency posts in several areas of Agam and Tanah Datar. The national disaster mitigation agency, or BNPB, said 84 homes, 16 bridges and two mosques were damaged in Tanah Datar, as were 20 hectares (50 acres) of rice fields. Survivors recounted their horror when the flooding and rockfall began. I heard the thunder and the sound similar to boiling water. It was the sound of big rocks falling, housewife Rina Devina told AFP, adding that three of her neighbours were killed. It was pitch black, so I used my cellphone as a flashlight. The road was muddy, so I chanted God, have mercy! over and over again, she said of her evacuation to a local officials office. Indonesia is prone to landslides and floods during the rainy season. In 2022, about 24,000 people were evacuated and two children were killed in floods on Sumatra island, with environmental campaigners blaming deforestation caused by logging for worsening the disaster.

Furthermore, the Education Minister also commented regarding the issues pertaining to the recruitment of English Language teachers. Premajayantha further said: Now, the appointments have been finalized based on the results of the examination held for the recruitment of 500 diploma-holders as English teachers in 2021. Interviews are currently underway, with 100 positions allocated for national schools and 400 for rural schools. The issue is that we should also uphold the standard of question papers for teaching exams, however, the issue of a lack of teachers still persists, he added.",

        "content": "The Supreme Court has instructed the Attorney General to submit a report pertaining to the progress of investigations into Pastor Jerome Fernando, the self-styled prophet who came under fire over his controversial comments on other religions. This order was issued when a Fundamental Rights (FR) petition filed against Pastor Jerome Fernando was taken up before a three-member Supreme Court judge bench led by Chief Justice Jayantha Jayasuriya today (13). Several religious leaders had filed this petition seeking an order to prosecute Pastor Jerome Fernando under the United Nations International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) over his derogatory statements related to Lord Buddha and other religious figures. Pastor Fernando found himself in hot water after a video of one of his sermons went viral on social media, due to allegations that it included derogatory statements related to Lord Buddha and other religious figures. Fernando then flew out to Singapore on May 14, 2023, two days before the Colombo Fort Magistrates Court banned his foreign travels. After months of controversy over his remarks, Fernando returned to the island on November 29. As per an Appeals Court directive, the CIDs Cyber Crime Investigation Division obtained a statement from the pastor within 48 hours of his arrival on the island. He was first placed behind bars on remand on December 01, following his arrest by the Criminal Investigation Department (CID), a few hours after he arrived at the premises to record a statement for the second consecutive day. Pastor Fernando was subsequently further remanded until December 27, on the orders of Colombo Fort Magistrates Court. The Colombo Fort Magistrates Court granted bail to Fernando on 03 January 2024. Despite granting bail, the court imposed travel restrictions on Pastor Jerome, prohibiting him from leaving the country, and the strict condition that he refrain from making any such statements in the future that could disturb religious harmony.",

        "date": "May 13, 2024 04:30 pm",
        "content": "North Korea, under the leadership of Kim Jong Un, enforces strict and often unusual laws, extending even to fashion choices. The regime imposes bans on popular global fashion and cosmetic brands, with severe penalties in case of non-compliance. And now, the North Korean government has banned red lipstick. Why has North Korea banned red lipstick? Despite the colour red having historical links with Communism, North Korea has banned red lipstick, for the leadership views it as a symbol of capitalism, and not Communist ideas. In fact, heavy makeup is frowned upon in North Korea and is looked at as a sign of Western influence. However, there is more to this ban than meets the eye. The regime worries that women wearing red lipstick could make them appear too attractive, thereby going against the governments stance on keeping things simple and modest. So, women are only allowed to wear minimal makeup, according to the law. North Koreas control over personal appearance extends beyond red lipstick. In recent years, the Kim Jong Un regime has banned several other items and styles supposedly linked to capitalist ideology, including skinny or blue jeans, body piercings, and certain hairstyles such as mullets and long hair for women. Only hairstyles approved by the state for both men and women are allowed. However, some bans are more personal than ideological. Reports suggest that certain fashion styles, like black trench coats or Mr Jong Uns signature swept-back hairstyle, are prohibited just because the supreme leader does not want people to copy him. To make sure people follow these rules, they have the Gyuchaldae or the fashion police, who keep a close eye on how everyone looks. What happens when people dont follow these rules? People who try to push these boundaries, such as by wearing blue jeans, can face severe consequences. They might be punished, fined, or stopped in public and their clothes could be cut up so they dont wear them anymore. Source:NDTV --Agencies",

        "content": "(Reuters) - ChatGPT-maker OpenAI plans to announce on Monday updates to its flagship chatbot as its most advanced AI model GPT-4, which feels like magic, CEO Sam Altman said on X on Friday. The company said on X that it will hold a livestream conference on Monday at 10am PT (1700 GMT) to demo some updates to ChatGPT and GPT-4. Reuters last week reported that the Microsoft-backed startup was planning an announcement Monday of an AI-powered search product one day ahead of Googles IO developers conference, citing sources. But the company decided to delay the search product announcement, according to one source familiar with the matter. On Friday, CEO Sam Altman posted on X that the announcement would be not gpt-5, not a search engine, but weve been hard at work on some new stuff we think people will love! feels like magic to me. OpenAI is under pressure to expand the user base of ChatGPT, its flagship chatbot product that wowed the world with its ability to produce humanlike written content and top-notch software code. Shortly after launching in late 2022, ChatGPT was called the fastest application to ever reach 100 million monthly active users. However, worldwide traffic to ChatGPTs website has been on a roller-coaster ride in the past year and is only now returning to its May 2023 peak, according to analytics firm Similarweb. Giving ChatGPT the search engine-like capability of accessing real-time, accurate web information is an obvious next step, and one that the current iteration of ChatGPT struggles with, industry experts have said. That would also put OpenAI in direct competition with Google, which has announced generative AI features for its own namesake search engine, and well-funded startup Perplexity, which has gained traction through providing an AI-native search interface that shows citations in results and images as well as text in its responses. Weaving in real-time information has not been an easy task. An earlier attempt to bring updated and real-world information in to ChatGPT, called ChatGPT plugins, was retired in April, according to a help center posting on OpenAIs website.

        "date": "May 13, 2024 10:41 pm",
        "content": "(Reuters) - France won a record 15 billion euros (16.17 billion) in foreign investment pledges on Monday, allowing President Emmanuel Macron to bask in the limelight with global CEOs and forget about strained public finances and weak polls for a while. The bumper crop of pledges, in sectors ranging from artificial intelligence to pharmaceuticals and energy, stood Macron in good stead as he hosted business leaders for the annual Choose France summit at Versailles Palace. This years figure is up from 13 billion euros announced in 2023. The French presidency said the investments included 56 different business projects and could lead to the creation of 10,000 jobs. Microsoft said it would invest 4 billion euros in France in its cloud and AI infrastructure, expanding its centres in Paris and Marseilles and adding a new data centre in the eastern city of Mulhouse. Over the weekend, France said Amazon would announce a 1.2-billion-euro investment at the event, to boost its logistics as well as Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud infrastructure. France is positioning itself as a European AI hub and the investments will help build the data infrastructure critical to support fast-growing, home-grown start-ups like Mistral AI. Microsoft President Brad Smith said that the investment reflected Frances commitment to a low-carbon energy programme and Macrons business reforms. Sometimes when we turn on the television we get the impression that nothings going well in France. I dont think its true, Macron said alongside Smith at an event unveiling the Microsoft investment. Theres a lot thats working and we dont pay enough attention to our considerable advantages. Macrons administration has taken flack from opposition parties over public finances after missing its deficit target and warning this years fiscal shortfall would be bigger than expected. Though traditionally strong on economic issues, that has left his party on a weak footing heading into EU parliamentary elections in June with the far-right far ahead in the polls. Government officials did not give details on what public financial and other support were offered, but the state offers tax credits for certain types of green investments and research and development. Projects aligning with public priorities like hydrogen or computer chips often qualify for grants while local governments frequently make land available to foreign investors. Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said the foreign investments were the fruit of government efforts over the last seven years to cut corporate taxes, which far-left parties say have been far too generous. Among other groups planning to boost their presence in France, drug companies Pfizer, AstraZeneca, Novartis and GSK announced investments together worth over 1 billion. Estonian high-power energy storage firm Skeleton Technologies pledged to invest 600 million euros over five years and create 300 jobs. Spain-based fertiliser group FertigHy planned to invest 1.3 billion euros in a low-emission hydrogen-based plant in northern France, creating 250 jobs. Chinas Hunan Changyuan Lico, South Korean group and Swiss firm KL1 are due to make investments worth together nearly 1 billion euros in producing materials or components for batteries. Macron was also scheduled to meet officials from Chinese battery company SVOLT as France pushes to create a battery manufacturing hub in the north. Le Maire was to host meetings on Monday with the CEOs of JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Bank of America, among others. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "date": "May 14, 2024 07:49 am",
        "content": "Minister of Water Supply and Estate Infrastructure Development, Jeevan Thondaman, affirmed that the government is ready to face any situation if the estate companies take court action against the governments decision to increase the wages of the estate workers community. Previously, plantation companies claimed an inability to augment the basic salary of workers even by a single rupee. However, following the governments declaration of a daily wage of Rs. 1700, Minister Thondaman disclosed that the companies proposed a Rs. 200 increase in the basic salary for estate workers. He emphasized that the companies have the ability to increase the wages of estate workers. Minister Thondaman made these statements while addressing a press briefing held at the President Media Centre (PMC) on Monday (13) under the theme Collective path to a stable country. The minister further stated that the Jaffna peninsula has long struggled with a severe shortage of drinking water, necessitating urgent solutions. Currently, only 11 of the peninsula enjoys access to clean drinking water. However, with the ongoing construction of a desalination plant, nearly 40 of the Jaffna peninsula will soon have access to drinking water. This could be pointed out as a considerable development in addressing the issue of water scarcity, he said. In the wake of a severe economic crisis affecting the country, estate workers are one of the groups most affected. Continuing long-term suffering amid economic turmoil, their struggle revolves around the pivotal issue of wages, the minister stressed. In response, the government has taken decisive action by officially mandating a daily wage of Rs. 1700 for estate workers under the leadership of President Ranil Wickremesinghe, through a gazette notification. It is now imperative for estate companies to adhere to this official judgment. Additionally, the government is prepared to confront any legal challenges from estate companies contesting the wage increase for plantation workers, he declared. The plantation companies previously claimed an inability to raise the basic salary of their workers even by a rupee. However, upon the issuance of a government gazette notification setting the daily wage for plantation workers at Rs. 1700, the same companies promptly augmented the basic salary by Rs.200. This demonstrates their capacity to improve the wages of estate workers, he claimed. Concurrently, the government is actively enhancing the estate communitys standard of living by addressing housing shortages among plantation workers, expanding educational and employment opportunities, and now, by increasing salaries. This concerted effort undoubtedly serves our estate community well, providing tangible benefits to our people. However, as the election season nears, certain parties tend to make a slew of promises to our people. Among these pledges, some claim to transform estate workers into small estate owners. However, they often fail to elaborate on the mechanisms behind such proposals, he said. --PMD",

This case was taken up before Colombo Additional Magistrate Harshana Kekunawela this morning (14). However, the CID informed the court that further investigations are underway regarding the relevant incident. Meanwhile, the attorneys representing the aggrieved party stated before the court that the mobile phones that have been taken into custody by the police contain confidential information such as pictures of the deceaseds wife and children, and therefore requested that an order be issued to allow the victims family to retrieve the mobile phones. After inquiring information from the CID in this regard, the Additional Magistrate informed that he would consider the request of the aggrieved party, after receiving the Government Analysts report related to the mobile phones in question. Later, the case was postponed to July 23. Former Director of the Janashakthi PLC Group, Dinesh Schaffter, was found tied up in his car at the General Cemetery in Borella on 15 December 2022 and died a day later while receiving treatment at the ICU of the National Hospital in Colombo. On November 01, 2023, the Colombo Magistrates Court determined that the death of businessman Dinesh Schaffter occurred as a result of an external pressure applied on his neck and the facial area, after the five-member experts committee comprising Judicial Medical Officers appointed to uncover the actual cause of death of the late businessman Schaffter submitted its report on the post-mortems to the court. Accordingly, the magistrate who ruled that a crime had been committed through this incident, ordered the Director of the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) to arrest the relevant suspects and produce them before the courts. There, the Additional Magistrate Rajindra Jayasuriya ordered the CID to take measures to hand over the remains of the late businessman, which are currently placed at the Karapitiya Teaching Hospital, to his family members.

        "content": "At least 14 people died and 75 others were injured after a billboard bigger than an Olympic swimming pool fell on them during a thunderstorm in Indias financial capital Mumbai, authorities said on Tuesday, with dozens still feared trapped. Videos showed the towering hoarding billowing in the wind before collapsing on houses and a fuel station next to a busy road in the eastern suburb of Ghatkopar on Monday as a dust storm and rain lashed the city in the evening, bringing traffic to a standstill and disrupting flights at Mumbai airport. Mumbais municipal corporation (BMC) said at least 75 injured people were taken to hospitals following the accident and 31 have been discharged. The agency owning the billboard did not have a permit from the BMC to put up the hoarding, the municipal body said in a statement. The hoarding measured about 1,338 square meters (14,400 square feet), it said, bigger than an Olympic pools 1,250 square meters and nine times more than the maximum permitted size for a hoarding. The BMC said it has instructed the agency to remove all its hoardings immediately. To prevent such accidents from happening again, instructions have been given to conduct a structural audit of all hoardings in Mumbai and immediately take down dangerous ones, Eknath Shinde, the chief minister of Maharashtra state of which Mumbai is the capital, said in a post on X. About 25 people and some cars were still trapped under the crumpled hoarding, said a BMC official, who did not want to be named as he was not authorized to speak to the media. Officials from fire services, police, disaster response and other authorities continued rescue operations that were taking longer because gas cutters could not be used at the site due to the presence of the fuel pump.

        "content": "Artificial intelligence is hitting the global labour market like a tsunami International Monetary Fund Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said on Monday. Artificial intelligence is likely to impact 60 of jobs in advanced economies and 40 of jobs around the world in the next two years, Georgieva told an event in Zurich. We have very little time to get people ready for it, businesses ready for it, she told the event organised by the Swiss Institute of International Studies, associated to the University of Zurich. It could bring tremendous increase in productivity if we manage it well, but it can also lead to more misinformation and, of course, more inequality in our society. Georgieva said the world economy had become more prone to shocks in recent years, citing the global pandemic in 2020, as well as the war in Ukraine. Although she expected more shocks, particularly due to the climate crisis, remained remarkably resilient, she said. We are not in global recession, said Georgieva, who was heckled by protesters calling for action on climate change and tackling developing world debt. Last year there were fears that most economies would slip into recession, that didnt happen, she said. Inflation that has hit us with a very strong force is on the decline, almost everywhere. Swiss National Bank Chairman Thomas Jordan, who also spoke at the event, said the fight against inflation in Switzerland was now far advanced. Inflation rose to 1.4 in April, the 11th month in a row that price rises have been within the SNBs 0-2 target range. The outlook for inflation is much better. It looks that for the next few years, inflation could be really in the same range of price stability, Jordan said. But there is a lot of uncertainty. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "date": "May 14, 2024 04:17 pm",
        "content": "Fans of Korean pop bands around the world are increasingly channeling their millions-strong online community into climate and environmental activism, protesting business deals linked to coal power, urging K-pop entertainers to cut waste and raising awareness about climate-related issues. Other climate activist groups have begun joining forces with Kpop4Planet, an environmental group founded in 2021 by K-pop fans Nurul Sarifah and Dayeon Lee. After Kpop4Planet petitioned South Korean automaker Hyundai Motor Co., it recently scrapped a deal linked to coal power plants in Indonesia. The ability to quickly organize a large, dedicated group has made K-pop fans an increasingly influential lobby online as they participate in protests and promote causes that have included the Black Lives Matter movement. Politicians also have tried to tap into that power. I spotted how K-pop fans can be seen as a potential power, said Sarifah. We think we can harness that power for climate change action. In 2021, Korea Beyond Coal a coalition of civic groups calling for South Korea to stop using coal power  teamed up with Kpop4Planet in 2021 to raise awareness about plans for a coal-burning power plant. The plant site near Maengbang Beach, the photo shoot location for album artwork for one of K-pop band BTSs hit songs, is a popular destination for the bands fans and a joint petition created by Kpop4Planet and Korea Beyond Coal got thousands of signatures. We realized Kpop4Planet has the experience of mobilizing and connecting people and sharing information using social media ... which is very helpful when it comes to climate campaigning, said Euijin Kim, a communications officer for Solutions for Our Climate, which is part of Korea Beyond Coal. The power plant is still going ahead, but the groups were able to raise awareness about the environmental issues caused by coal power, Lee said. We want to show the power and influence that the K-pop fans can have ... we believe that if we gather all together, we can make better social impacts and maybe change our society in more sustainable ways, said Lee. And, of course, love K-pop together. Korean pop culture fan clubs activism and philanthropy began in the 1960s, said Stephanie Choi, a postdoctoral associate at the University of Buffalo studying K-pop culture. Now, K-pop fans regularly organize thousands of people on social media platforms to buy gifts for wildly popular K-pop singers and bands, or promote other causes. Sarifah and Lee have aligned Kpop4Planets activities with various causes, beginning with urging entertainment companies to cut back on waste related to the K-pop fan culture of collecting photo cards of band members, which are included in albums and sold as merchandise. K-pop labels often release multiple versions of albums with dozens of different photo cards, encouraging fans to bulk-buy albums to participate in lucky draws for meet-and-greet events with K-pop stars. The problem is that this creates a lot of waste, Lee said in an interview. We wanted to tackle that issue first, because it was the most well-known issue among K-pop fans. Entertainment companies havent directly responded to Kpop4Planets petitions and other approaches, but Lee still views the campaign as a success. There were changes after our campaigning: major entertainment companies published environmental, social and governance reports and published eco-friendly albums, including some releasing records using QR codes to minimize waste, she said. Kpop4Planets petition against Hyundai protested an agreement the company signed to buy aluminum from projects linked to coal power in Indonesia. The memorandum of understanding signed in 2022 with a unit of one of Indonesias largest coal miners, Adaro Energy Indonesia, gave Hyundai the right to purchase low-carbon aluminum from an industrial park Indonesian officials portray as green. However, the smelter used to make the aluminum initially will be powered by newly built coal-fired plants. Hydroelectric and solar power will power the industrial park at a later date. Given K-pop group BTSs collaboration with Hyundai, Kpop4Planet saw a chance to put their influence to work. In March 2023, Kpop4Planet launched a petition asking Hyundai to withdraw from the project until it phases out coal, and to disclose details of the energy used to make the aluminum. The petition got over 10,000 signatures in two months, and Kpop4Planet sent their pleas to Hyundai Motors headquarters. In March, Hyundai Motor said it had ended its agreement with Adaro. Following the expiry of the MOU at the end of 2023, both companies have decided not to renew it and to explore other opportunities independently, a spokesperson for Hyundai Motor wrote in an email to The Associated Press. Adaro did not respond to a request for comment sent by AP. This a victory of thousands of people, friends who took actions and also show that they genuinely care about the climate crisis and local communities, said Sarifah.

The Union Home Ministry of India imposed the ban invoking the sub-sections (1) and (3) of section 3 of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967. In a notification, the home ministry said the central government is of the opinion that the LTTE is still indulging in activities which are prejudicial to the integrity and security of the country. It said that even after its military defeat in May, 2009 in Sri Lanka, the LTTE has not abandoned the concept of Eelam (an independent country for Tamils) and has been clandestinely working towards the Eelam cause by undertaking fund raising and propaganda activities and the remnant LTTE leaders or cadres have also initiated efforts to regroup the scattered activists and resurrect the outfit locally and internationally. The pro-LTTE groupselements continue to foster a separatist tendency amongst the masses and enhance the support base for LTTE in India and particularly in Tamil Nadu, which will ultimately have a strong disintegrating influence over the territorial integrity of India, the notification said, citing a few other reasons too.

Mr. Donald Lu, who claimed that many big powers are competing for influence in the region, stated that the US expects the countries in the region to exercise sovereignty. In response to a question whether the US intervene in internal matters of the nation, the US envoy assured that they are not overthrowing any governments, adding that the US needs fair and peaceful elections to be held within Sri Lanka. While emphasizing the importance of functional truth reconciliation within the country, Mr. Lu commended President Ranil Wickremesinghes decision to grant land rights to general public. He also mentioned that the legacy of the war must leave behind some positive effects as well.",

        "content": "The Committee on Public Finance (CoPF) expressed strong displeasure regarding the absence of officials from the Ministry of Public Security and the Department of Immigration and Emigration during discussions concerning the recent issues pertaining to the process of issuing online visa for foreigners visiting Sri Lanka. The committee chair Harsha de Silva noted that officials from the Public Security Ministry and the Immigration Department had previously committed to attending the committee meeting but failed to do so, which was viewed as disrespectful to the committee. The late notice provided the evening before the meeting was deemed unacceptable, the Parliamentary Communications Department said. As a result, it was decided to summon representatives from the relevant ministry and the department once again for further discussions regarding the appointment of GBS-IVS and VFS Global as authorized agents for online visa applications. Sri Lanka Mobitel (PVT) Ltd. and the National Data Protection Authority was also summoned to the CoPF meeting which was held in the Parliament premises today (14), in order to inquire regarding how the visa issuing process has been functioning under their institutions until 2023 and on making necessary updates in this regard.

        "date": "May 15, 2024 08:16 am",
        "content": "Education Minister Dr. Susil Premajayantha said that arrangements are in place to establish 1,220 school clusters across the country and 350 school boards are to be formed to oversee their operations under the initial phase of educational administration reforms. Dr. Premajayantha emphasized that the necessary Cabinet memorandum outlining these reforms will be imminently presented, with the accompanying circular set to be issued in the near future. The Minister made these remarks on Tuesday (14) during a press briefing held at the Presidential Media Centre (PMC) under the theme of Collective Path to a Stable Country. Minister of Education Dr. Susil Premajayantha further commented: When I assumed the role of Education Minister two years ago, we were confronted with a dire situation. Fuel shortages were preventing children from attending school, and examiners lacked fuel for essential travel. Additionally, a 14-hour power cut disrupted educational engagement, while schools had to be closed in time to time. Furthermore, due to the closure of schools during the Covid-19 epidemic, educational activities were severely disrupted. Exams could not be held, and results were not released on time. Following that, the education sector was severely affected with the worsening of the economic crisis. However, significant progress has been made in improving the situation. All textbooks and uniforms for this academic year have been distributed. Examinations are gradually returning to their regular schedule. To this end, it has been proposed that the G.C.E. (OL) and G.C.E. (AL) Examinations should be held in the months of December and August. Discussions have been held with provincial authorities and relevant parties, and we are now implementing the agreed-upon proposals. As part of this plan, the on-going G.C.E. (OL) Examination which is to be held in December will conclude tomorrow, paper marking will begin immediately. Advanced Level classes will commence for students who have completed the G.C.E. (OL) before the results are released. This year, approximately 452,000 students are sitting for the G.C.E. (OL) examination. Among them 388,000 being first or second-time attendees. These students will have the opportunity to enrol in Advanced Level classes by the first week of June, following necessary Cabinet approvals, which have already been obtained. The official circular regarding this will be issued on 15th May. Following the completion of exams, normal school activities are set to commence on 20th May. Furthermore, we have initiated the first phase of educational administration reforms. The related Cabinet memorandum will be submitted soon and its circular will also be issued shortly thereafter. Under this initiative, 1,220 school clusters will be established across the country and they will be overseen by 350 newly created school boards. Additionally, the current 100 education zones will be systematically expanded. Building upon the concept of school clusters, school authorities will now have the authority to allocate students from year 01 to year 11 to the leading schools within their respective clusters for Advanced Level education. Moreover, interviews have been conducted to fill teaching vacancies in chemistry, physics, biology, mathematics and technology streams, and foreign languages. Out of the 7,000 candidates interviewed, over 3,000 have been appointed based on subject expertise. Following the training, these appointees will be deployed to schools by 01st June significantly alleviating the shortage of teachers in science and technology subjects. Additionally, efforts are underway to address issues related to provincial teacher appointments, which had been suspended by the court orders. Furthermore, we have established a committee tasked with resolving issues of the school principals. A Cabinet Memorandum has been drafted, addressing key concerns, including recommendations endorsed by Association of Sri Lanka School Principals. Notably, the memorandum covers matters such as principal allowances, grade elevation, and other practical considerations. Moreover, numerous vacancies exist within the Education Administration Service. Interviews for the recruitment of 404 positions, based on the outcomes of a limited competitive examination, are set to commence next week. Additionally, the second round of interviews for the selection of 800 teacher educators will take place in the near future. Drafting of laws on the convert National Colleges of Education into universities has also been completed. --PMD",

Co-Chairman of the Joint Committee of University Trade Unions Dhammika S. Priyantha stated that the association unanimously agreed to withdraw from all voluntary services within universities.

These disruptions will significantly impact various operations within the university system, he said. Also, the authorities should take full responsibility for the destruction of samples maintained at the laboratory level in the university system. This kind of thing is happening to the university system because of the actions of this government. If the administration continues to avoid it, we should also rethink about the activities that we voluntarily carry out in the university, said Priyantha.

        "title": "End of Lee era for Singapore as PM steps down",
        "date": "May 15, 2024 10:38 am",
        "content": "Singapores long-serving Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong is stepping down, marking the end of a political era for the island nation. After 20 years in power, Mr Lee will formally hand over the reins to deputy PM and finance minister Lawrence Wong on Wednesday night. Since becoming an independent nation in 1965, Singapore has only had three prime ministers - all from the ruling Peoples Action Party (PAP). The first was Mr Lees father, Lee Kuan Yew, who is widely considered as the founder of modern Singapore and led the country for 25 years. Analysts say the transition signals an evolution in Singapores political leadership as it moves out of the shadow of the Lee family, even though Mr Lee will remain in cabinet as a senior minister. Over the weekend in his final interview as Prime Minister with local media, he thanked Singaporeans for their support. I didnt try to run faster than everybody else. I tried to bring everybody to run with me, he said. And I think we did have some success. He added that he had tried to do (things) my way in a different fashion from his father and other predecessor, Goh Chok Tong. Mr Lee joined politics in 1984 as a backbencher while his father was still in power. He rose up the ranks under Singapores second Prime Minister Mr Goh before taking the helm in 2004. The first years of his political career were inevitably marked by intense scrutiny. Critics accused the family of nepotism and said they were creating a political dynasty, which the Lees repeatedly denied. In private, some Singaporeans joked about fami-Lee politics and the trinity of father, son, and the holy Goh. But over two decades as leader of Singapore, Mr Lee made his mark. Under his watch, Singapores economy diversified and grew, as the island transformed into an international financial powerhouse and top tourist destination. Its GDP per capita has more than doubled in the past 20 years. Mr Lees government has also been credited with competently steering the country through several recessions, the global financial crisis and the Covid pandemic. In international geopolitics, Mr Lee carefully balanced Singapores relationships with the US and China amid the superpowers increasingly fraught tug-of-war for loyalty in the region. His government also finally repealed a controversial anti-gay sex law following years of lobbying from LGBTQ groups, though freedom of speech remains tightly restricted. With his political lineage and avuncular, scholarly image, Mr Lee is generally well-liked by Singaporeans. He has topped survey rankings of Singapores most popular politicians and his constituency consistently receives the highest vote share in elections. But he has not escaped criticism nor controversy. His governments decision to let in large numbers of immigrants to solve labour shortages in the late 2000s triggered deep unhappiness. As Singapore became wealthier, social inequality increased and the income gap widened. Under Mr Lee, the PAP received its lowest-ever vote share in 2011 and again in 2020. Lee Hsien Loongs main legacy would be the way he supercharged the economy, noted Singapore governance expert Donald Low, who is an academic with the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. But in the first half of his tenure, that came at the price of increasing unhappiness at rising inequality, the higher presence of foreigners, competition for jobs, congestion and the potential erosion of citizenship identity. Political commentator Sudhir Vadaketh said Mr Lees government was completely unprepared to accommodate the high immigration they deemed necessary for their push to become a global city. By failing to get a buy-in from Singaporeans, they seeded a very bad form of racism and bigotry that persists to this day, said Mr Vadaketh who runs the independent news magazine Jom. Surveys show, external that a growing number of Singaporeans feel racism is a problem and that it amplified, external during the pandemic. Some analysts also say that Mr Lees government has not adequately solved a complicated long-term issue involving public housing, which most Singaporeans live in. Many peoples savings are invested in these flats which are leased from the government for 99 years and will depreciate in value as they age. The government has acknowledged these issues and tried to address them with stricter rules on immigration, new housing schemes, and a proposed update to anti-racism laws. On the personal front, a simmering private family feud over the home belonging to Mr Lees father spilled out into the open in 2016, a year after Lee Kuan Yew died. The PM was plunged into a years-long public battle with his siblings, and Singaporeans watched agog as their most high-profile family slugged it out. At one point, Mr Lees siblings called him a dishonourable son and alleged he was capitalising on their fathers legacy to build a political dynasty. They also alleged he was abusing his power and feared he was using the organs of the state against them. Some members of Mr Lees family including his brother now live abroad in self-imposed exile, claiming persecution. Mr Lee has denied all these accusations. He has also said his children are not interested in joining politics. Source: BBC --Agencies",

        "date": "May 15, 2024 01:02 pm",
        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe has highlighted the governments efforts to enact numerous new laws aimed at apprehending criminals over the past two years. He made this observation during the opening ceremony of the new Court Complex in Theldeniya today (15). Wickremesinghe also highlighted the governments achievement of implementing 75 new laws in the past two years emphasizing that this initiative has positioned Sri Lanka as the sole country in South Asia with a modern legal system. Despite facing accusations of shielding wrongdoers, the government remains steadfast in its commitment to combatting crime and ensuring justice, he further said. Some accuse the government of protecting thieves. However, illogically, this same government, accused of protecting thieves, has introduced legislation to arrest them. However, he added that effective implementation of these laws requires practical experience, requiring comprehensive training programs. He said Ministry of Justice has undertaken the responsibility for this initiative, with support assured by the World Bank, Asian Development Bank, and the United States. The President also reiterated his commitment to combating corruption by undertaking various transformative measures, the Presidents Media Division (PMD) reported. In his address, President Wickremesinghe further stated: After almost a century, we have implemented numerous reforms in the field of law. Over the past two years, we have enacted approximately 75 new laws. This is a significant achievement, considering that some parliaments work for even 4 or 5 years without passing this amount of laws. A governments purpose is to work, and MPs should attend Parliament to fulfil their legislative duties. Accordingly, we have worked to introduce a new legal system by adopting these laws in Parliament. We have also paid special attention to addressing delays in the legal process. For justice to be realized, the law must be executed in a timely manner. This is a challenge we must confront. Efficient hearings will encourage more cases to be filed, ensuring that justice is served promptly. The rule of law should be reaffirmed in the country. If people take the law into their own hands and destroy property, there is no law. The stability of a country depends on the rule of law. A country gains recognition only when justice is done; otherwise, there will be no development, and investment cannot be expected. Today, we have established such a legal system in the country. Furthermore, a new economic transformation is currently underway. We are creating an export-based economy. We have agreed with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to implement several laws to support this transformation. The first of these, the law for the Central Bank, has been passed, granting the Central Bank independence. Additionally, we have presented a bill to restructure the Electricity Board. The boards heavy losses were a major factor in the collapse of our economy. We must therefore establish an efficient electricity board. I assure you that this will not harm the rights of the government. The government has also presented three more draft bills that are scheduled for cabinet approval next Monday. We have already implemented controls on loans as part of these measures. Previously, there was no national debt control in place. To reduce our debt, we need to implement effective debt management. By 2035-2040, our goal is to control the debt down to 75. The government must act according to this new debt control law. Additionally, the governments monetary control was previously governed by monetary regulations, which could be violated or amended through circulars. As a result, there has been no effective monetary control in the country so far. Currently, no one is fully aware of the governments assets. Therefore, we have introduced laws for the management of public money. New Zealand pioneered this system, followed by the United Kingdom, Australia and India. We have now presented the latest version of this law. We must transition from an import-based economy to an export-based economy. To achieve this, a draft of the economic transformation law will be submitted in the future. We have fulfilled all the conditions agreed upon with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which we are legally bound to adhere to. Sri Lanka has previously been accused of violating IMF agreements, but now, with these agreements enforced by law, such violations are no longer possible. Moving forward is imperative. Failure to comply will jeopardize the support we expect from the IMF. These laws are expected to be introduced after our June meeting with the IMF. Subsequent laws will follow after establishing the foundational framework of the economic transformation law. These actions are being undertaken in accordance with agreements reached with the IMF and countries that have provided loans. Discussions with private creditors are also progressing positively. Some individuals claim that these discussions are unsuccessful, while others are predicting about the dissolution of Parliament. When they made this type of statements the stock market will face a down turn on the following day. Then they are purchasing the shares. Despite government reassurances that no such decisions have been made, they persist in echoing these claims on their platforms. This is not a political issue. Meanwhile, corruption has arisen as a significant concern in our country. Discussions with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and our lending countries have centred on addressing this issue. We have proposed a comprehensive program to tackle corruption, which has been augmented with amendments. With the agreement formally declared, the implementation of new laws is underway. There are four rules for them. We introduced the 21st amendment as our initial step, leading to the establishment of the related commission. Additionally, the Anti-Corruption Act was enacted in 2023 and amended it in 2024. Also, actions have also taken to curb corruption in spending money on administrative tasks. It is a more essentially advanced system than the law provides for. Although the development of such a system poses a challenge due to a lack of expertise, the government has drafted a report on public administration investigations, subject to amendments as per the proposal made to the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Furthermore, work is underway to draft the Proceeds of Crime Act. According to that Sri Lanka has the latest laws in South Asia, indicating a shift in politics. Previously, corruption had been merely a political slogan, with promises to arrested offenders within a short timeframe upon assuming power proving elusive. Some accuse the government of protecting thieves. However, illogically, this same government, accused of protecting thieves, has introduced legislation to arrest them. Yet, effective implementation of these laws requires practical experience, requiring comprehensive training programs. The Ministry of Justice has undertaken the responsibility for this initiative, with support assured by the World Bank, Asian Development Bank, and the United States of America. Consequently, over the past two years, we have achieved three significant milestones under this administration. Firstly, we have strengthened the administration of justice and the rule of law. Secondly, legislation has been enacted to foster an export-oriented economy. Finally, efforts to adopt anti-corruption measures are underway. I request to everyone for their assistance in these endeavours.",

Mr Darmanin told French media on Wednesday the attack was an act of cold-blooded barbarity and that around 450 gendarmes and police officers had been mobilised in the Eure department of Normandy in an unprecedented search. President Emmanuel Macron has told France that everything is being done to find the perpetrators. Meanwhile, French prison officer unions have called for walkouts at institutions across the country on Wednesday in support of the two who died. In a joint statement, the unions demanded urgent measures to improve staff safety - including the drastic reduction of extraditions of prisoners to court hearings, by promoting video-conferencing, and an overhaul to escort levels. A minutes silence will be taking place on Wednesday at 11:00 (09:00 GMT), and there have been demonstrations outside of French prisons, including in Paris according to local media. French Justice Minister Eric Dupond-Moretti has said he would meet with union representatives. Who is escaped French prisoner Mohamed Amra? Addressing a press conference on Tuesday, Paris state prosecutor Laure Beccuau said the attack took place just before 11:00 local time when the van carrying Amra crossed the toll barrier in Incarville in the Eure region of northern France and immediately, a Peugeot vehicle hit it from the front to stop it. Men with long guns got out, joined by other armed men who got out of an Audi vehicle, which was likely following the prison vehicle. They fired several times at the two vehicles, killing and injuring officers, before leaving the scene and taking Amra with them. The Paris prosecutor said two vehicles believed to have been used by the criminals were found scorched, in different locations, later on Tuesday. Mr Dupond-Moretti told reporters on Tuesday one of the officers killed leaves behind a wife and two children who were meant to celebrate their 21st birthday in two days. While the second officer killed, aged 34, leaves behind a wife who is five months pregnant. Three other officers were injured in the attack. As reported by local media, Ms Beccuau said the three injured officers are also fathers - aged 48, 52 and 55 years old. Everything - and I mean everything - will be put in place to find the perpetrators of this vile crime, Mr Dupond-Moretti said, adding that the perpetrators were people for whom life has no value. They will be found and punished in a way that is proportionate to the crime, the justice minister added. Amra was convicted of burglary on 10 May and had been indicted by prosecutors in Marseille for a kidnapping that led to a death. His lawyer, Hugues Vigier, told French news channel BFMTV he would like to believe that he Amra didnt know about the plan to free him. For me this plan doesnt match with what I know of him. If hes behind it then I failed to understand who he is, Mr Vigier added. According to some French media reports, Amra had tried to escape his prison cell earlier this week by trying to saw the cells bars. Ms Beccuau, the capitals state prosecutor, told a news conference Amra had 13 convictions, with the first one dating back to October 2009 - when he was 15 years old. Although the now 30-year-old was not a closely watched inmate, the Paris prosecutor said his transportation required a level three escort. Amra is said to have ties to a gang in the southern city of Marseille, which has been plagued by drug-related gang violence. But his criminal record to date does not contain any convictions for drug offences, the Paris prosecutor said on Tuesday. Source: BBC --Agencies",

        "content": "Two stars of the game are tied at the top of the T20I all-rounder rankings with a little more than a fortnight until the commencement of the T20 World Cup. The race to be the No.1 ranked all-rounder at the start of the ICC Mens T20 World Cup has further intensified as two players share top billing following the latest update to the ICC Mens T20 Player Rankings. Just 23 rating points separate the top five players on the updated list for T20I all-rounders, with Bangladesh veteran Shakib Al Hasan joined by Sri Lanka captain Wanindu Hasaranga in the top spot with just over a fortnight to the start of the T20 World Cup. Shakib drops three rating points following two appearances at the backend of Bangladeshs recent five-match T20I series against Zimbabwe, with Hasaranga joining the veteran in a share of the top spot and Afghanistans Mohammad Nabi just a further 10 rating point adrift. Zimbabwes Sikandar Raza gains two places to rise to fourth on the back of some strong performances against Bangladesh, while South Africas Aiden Markram loses one spot to drop to fifth ahead of the Proteas campaign at the T20 World Cup. There was also some movement on the updated T20I rankings for batters, with a pair of Ireland players and a dasher from Pakistan the biggest eye-catchers following their recently completed series in Dublin. Ireland opener Andrew Balbirnie jumps six places to 53rd for T20I batters on the back of 128 runs from three games against Pakistan, while teammate Harry Tector improves 12 spots to 69th on the same list following 98 runs in the same series. Hard-hitting Pakistan left-hander Fakhar Zaman rises four places to 57th on the updated rankings for T20I batters, while compatriot Imad Wasim moves up 24 spots to equal 52nd on the list for T20I bowlers and five rungs to equal 16th for T20I all-rounders following his economical efforts with the ball against Ireland. There is also some joy for a pair of Bangladesh pacers on the updated list for T20I bowlers, with right-armer Taskin Ahmed jumping three places to 23rd and teammate Mustafizur Rahman moving up five spots to 25th after some good performances against Zimbabwe.

        "date": "May 15, 2024 06:39 pm",
        "content": "A High Court in Pakistan on Wednesday granted bail to Imran Khan in the 190 million pounds corruption case, in which the jailed former prime minister and his wife are accused of receiving land worth billions of rupees as a bribe from a real estate tycoon. A two-member bench of the Islamabad High Court had reserved the verdict on Tuesday after the completion of arguments. On Wednesday, the court asked Khan to submit a surety bond of Rs 1 million in order to secure bail. However, the order will not result in the ex-premiers release from Adiala jail since his sentences in the Iddat and cypher cases are yet to be suspended. In December last year, the National Accountability Bureau initiated an investigation against Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder Khan, his wife Bushra Bibi, and others in a case of alleged acquisition of hundreds of canals of land under the name of Al Qadir University Trust, resulting in a reported loss of 190 million pounds to the exchequer. In his bail application in November last year, Khan alleged that the NAB, while acting as a tool of the previous Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) government, used the case to harass him on political grounds. The Al-Qadir Trust case is about the settlement of 190 million pounds, about Rs 50 billion, which the UKs National Crime Agency sent to Pakistan after recovering the amount from a Pakistani property tycoon. Being the prime minister then, Khan, instead of depositing in the national treasury, allowed the businessman to use the amount to partly settle a fine of about Rs 450 billion imposed by the Supreme Court some years ago. Reportedly, the tycoon, in return, gifted about 57 acres of land to a trust set up by Khan and Bushra Bibi to establish the Al-Qadir University in the Sohawa area of the Jhelum district of Punjab. Khan has been lodged at the high-security Adiala Jail in Rawalpindi since August last year. Since his removal from power in a no-confidence motion in April 2022, Khan has been convicted in at least four cases, including the cipher (secret diplomatic communication) case.

        "content": "Media release video of attempted assassination attempt on Slovak PMhttps:t.cozfB5QnJO1k pic.twitter.comdKPYFBXdAS Ukrainska Pravda in English (pravda_eng) May 15, 2024 (AP)  Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico is in life-threatening condition after being wounded in a shooting after a political event Wednesday afternoon, according to his Facebook profile. The populist, pro-Russian leader, 59, was hit in the stomach after four shots were fired outside the House of Culture in the town of Handlova, some 150 kilometers (93 miles) northeast of the capital where the leader was meeting with supporters, according to reports on TA3, a Slovak TV station. A suspect has been detained, the countrys president said in a televised statement. A message posted to Ficos Facebook account said that the leader has been shot multiple times and is currently in life-threatening condition. It said he was being transported by helicopter to the Banská Bystrica, 29 kilometers (63 miles) away from Handlova because it would take too long to get to Bratislava due to the necessity of an acute procedure. The next few hours will decide, it said. Outgoing President Zuzana Caputova, a political rival of Fico, said in a televised statement: A physical attack on the Prime Minister is, first of all, an attack on a person, but it is also an attack on democracy. Any violence is unacceptable. The hateful rhetoric weve been witnessing in society leads to hateful actions. Please, lets stop it. President-elect Peter Pellegrini, an ally of Fico, called the assassination an unprecedented threat to Slovak democracy. If we express other political opinions with pistols in squares, and not in polling stations, we are jeopardizing everything that we have built together over 31 years of Slovak sovereignty. There were reactions of shock from across Europe, and some were calling it an attempted assassination of the leader in the NATO state, although no motive for the shooting was immediately apparent. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg posted on the social media platform X that he was shocked and appalled by the shooting. The shooting in Slovakia comes three weeks ahead of crucial European Parliament elections, in which populist and hard-right parties in the 27-nation bloc appear poised to make gains. Deputy speaker of parliament Lubos Blaha confirmed the incident during a session of Slovakias Parliament and adjourned it until further notice, the Slovak TASR news agency said. Slovakias major opposition parties, Progressive Slovakia and Freedom and Solidarity, canceled a planned protest against a controversial government plan to overhaul public broadcasting that they say would give the government full control of public radio and television. We absolutely and strongly condemn violence and todays shooting of Premier Robert Fico, said Progressive Slovakia leader Michal Simecka. At the same time we call on all politicians to refrain from any expressions and steps which could contribute to further increasing the tension. President Zuzana Caputova condemned a brutal and ruthless attack on the premier. Im shocked, Caputova said. I wish Robert Fico a lot of strength in this critical moment and a quick recovery from this attack. Fico, a third-time premier, and his leftist Smer, or Direction, party, won Slovakias Sept. 30 parliamentary elections, staging a political comeback after campaigning on a pro-Russian and anti-American message. Critics worried Slovakia under Fico would abandon the countrys pro-Western course and follow the direction of Hungary under populist Prime Minister Viktor Orbán. Thousands have repeatedly rallied in the capital and across Slovakia to protest Ficos policies. Condemnations of political violence quickly came from leaders across Europe. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen condemned what she described as a vile attack. Such acts of violence have no place in our society and undermine democracy, our most precious common good, von der Leyen said in a post on X. Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala called the incident shocking, adding I wish the premier to get well soon. We cannot tolerate violence, theres no place for it in society. The Czech Republic and Slovakia formed Czechoslovakia till 1992. Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk wrote on the social media network X: Shocking news from Slovakia. Robert, my thoughts are with you in this very difficult moment. Source: The Associated Press --Agencies",

        "title": "At least 16 Sri Lankans killed fighting in Russia-Ukraine war",
        "date": "May 15, 2024 08:43 pm",
        "content": "At least 16 Sri Lankan military veteran have been killed fighting in the war between Russia and Ukraine, the State Minister of Defence said. Sri Lanka opened an inquiry last week into the recruitment of its citizens for the conflict that has since identified the participation of 288 retired soldiers from the island nation, state minister Pramitha Bandara Tennakoon said. We have confirmed information about 16 who have been killed, he told reporters in Colombo. Tennakoon did not say which side of the conflict the soldiers had been fighting on. But ruling party lawmaker Gamini Waleboda told parliament on Monday that most had been recruited to fight alongside the Russian army. Those who joined had been duped with promises of high salaries and falsely told they would be given non-combat roles, Waleboda said. Tennakoon said the recruitment of Sri Lankans was being treated as a human trafficking enterprise and urged military officers not to fall prey to the recruitment drive. The Sri Lankan government was also in talks with both the Ukrainian and Russian foreign ministries to track down Sri Lankans in the two countries and bring them back safely. This is a delicate issue, Tennakoon said. We are friends with Russia, we are friends with Ukraine. Both are important for us so we are talking to the foreign ministries to get our people back safely. Complaints began pouring in from relatives after the defense ministry established its probe last week to collect information on those who had traveled to both countries to join the war effort. Sri Lanka has repeatedly warned its citizens against traveling to Russia or Ukraine to join the fighting. Tennakoon emphasized the stringent enforcement of the law against individuals involved in human trafficking. He highlighted that severe penalties would be imposed on those found guilty, regardless of their social status and standing. Additionally, the State Minister revealed that a group of suspects, including a retired senior military officer, has been arrested under suspicion of participating in human trafficking. Allegedly, they employed retired army personnel as soldiers in the Russian-Ukraine war. Legal proceedings have commenced against them. State Minister Tennakoon made these remarks while addressing a media briefing at the Presidential Media Centre (PMC) held today (15) under the theme Collective Path to a Stable Country. He further commented: The government has paid special attention to retired Sri Lankan armed forces personnel involved in the Russian-Ukraine war. In the recent Security Council meeting, President Ranil Wickremesinghe and other security chiefs were briefed on this matter. It is crucial to highlight that severe penalties will be imposed on those found guilty, regardless of their social status and standing. Furthermore, approximately 288 complaints have been lodged regarding this issue. Several persons, including a retired senior military officer, have been arrested on suspicion of human trafficking, and legal action has been initiated against them. They have been promoting human trafficking through social media campaigns, attracting victims with promises of high salaries and other privileges. As a result, individuals have fallen prey to this trafficking in successive waves. The government urges the public to remain vigilant against such manipulative tactics. The public is requested to contact 0112 401 146 if they possess any information about human trafficking. Furthermore, it should be mentioned that it has been decided to extend salaries and allowances to soldiers who died in the war or suffered total disability while serving in the Civil Security Department (CSD) beyond the age of 55. Under the leadership of the President, the government has addressed the challenges of individuals facing the termination of salaries or pensions after reaching 55 years of age. Consequently, this benefit, previously limited to the armed forces, will now be extended to CSD officers. The respective cabinet paper will be submitted for approval in the near future. Moreover, the Ministry of Defence has announced the conclusion of the general amnesty period for individuals who departed the forces without following legal procedures. The general amnesty period will end on 20th May. At present, around 15,000 individuals are eligible for this amnesty. Notably, in March 2024, 357 individuals left the forces illegally. Additionally, the number of individuals who illegally left and subsequently returned to service stands at 799. It is worth noting that this constitutes an exclusive situation. Furthermore, President Ranil Wickremesinghe has established a special committee, led by the Presidents Secretary, dedicated to granting concessions and expediting the allocation of land for war heroes. The Ministry of Lands is also actively involved in these efforts, which run parallel with the Urumaya program. It is worth noting that this initiative represents a distinctive measure aimed at enhancing the well-being of war heroes. --With Agencies Inputs",

        "date": "May 15, 2024 10:41 pm",
        "content": "Calls for Indian travelers to boycott the Maldives is absolutely helping Sri Lankas travel industry, the countrys Tourism Minister Harin Fernando said Wednesday. The Maldives issue is  helping us, Fernando told CNBC, referencing a social media row in January that resulted in a sharp drop in Indian visitors to the Maldives this year. India was the Maldives largest source market in 2023. But now it sits in 6th place, behind arrivals from China, Russia, the United Kingdom, Italy and Germany, according to Sri Lankas Ministry of Tourism. By contrast, nearly 34,400 Indian travelers went to Sri Lanka in January, more than double the 13,759 that visited in January last year, according to the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority. Arrivals in the first quarter of 2024 outpaced the same time period in 2023, despite a dip in April caused by a visa controversy that saw Sri Lankan visa temporarily double in price. Fernando also noted the tight relationship between Sri Lanka and India, both in business and tourism. Sri Lanka is a big market for Indian travelers, he said. Sri Lanka has more to offer  Sri Lanka has more value when it comes to India. He referenced the countrys beaches, casinos, shopping and the Ramayana Trail, a series of sites that are referenced in the Ramayana, an ancient Hindu epic. Plus, the two countries are highly connected, he said. Connectivity  that is the trigger factor, he said. Sri Lankan Airlines alone flies 80 times a week into Indian airports. Indias growing travel power Indian travelers are set to become the worlds fourth-largest travel spenders by 2030, a prediction which absolutely bodes well for Sri Lankas tourism industry, said Fernando. I think the fastest-growing economy is India, and Sri Lanka is definitely benefiting out of it, said Fernando, adding that Indian companies have made substantial investments on the island. ITC, the big hotel chain, opened their first hotel out of India in Sri Lanka. We just opened it about a few weeks back, and its a beautiful property  in Galle Face, he said, referencing the ocean-side area in the countrys capital city of Colombo. Its one of the best things that Ive seen in my life. A Maldives concept in Sri Lanka Fernando said he hopes to see more investments from global brands coming to Sri Lanka  investments that eluded the Teardrop Island as it waged a 25-year civil war, which ended in 2009. Weve invited a lot of investment from abroad, he said. Were doing some water bungalows in our new area  like a Maldives concept as well  because we are surrounded by the beach. Fernando also outlined plans to add adventure activities to appeal to younger travelers, from hot air balloons to skydiving and diving to explore more than 100 nearby shipwrecks dating to World War II, he said. With concert economics causing a tourism boom, Sri Lanka plans to bring in musical acts to attract tourists too, said Fernando. We are launching Sri Lanka as an entertainment hub, he said. We have a lot of big names coming in to perform. Source: CNBC --Agencies",

Following information received from a three-wheeler driver via the 119 police emergency hotline regarding the abduction, Aladeniya Police had acted immediately and reportedly apprehended the suspects along with the van in question within an hour. According to police, one of the arrested suspects had been involved in a relationship with the teenage girl, despite him already being married. The suspect, a former army soldier from Avissawella, and his friends had hired a van to carry out the abduction, police said. The relationship had begun after the suspect had visited the girls brother, also an army soldier, at his home in Polonnaruwa on multiple occasions. Upon discovering that the suspect was married, the girl had ended the relationship. However, due to continuous threats from the suspect, the girls parents had moved her to a house in the Kulugammana area. The abduction attempt has occurred while the student was returning home after sitting for the OL examination in that area. Aladeniya Police are continuing their investigation into the incident.",

        "title": "Sri Lankans in Russia-Ukraine warfront: President instructs to send delegation to Moscow",
        "date": "May 16, 2024 11:51 am",
        "content": "State Minister for Foreign Affairs Tharaka Balasuriya announced that President Ranil Wickremesinghe has issued directives for the dispatch of a specialized delegation to Russia to investigate the welfare of Sri Lankans amidst the on-going Russian-Ukraine war. According to the state minister, this delegation will include the Secretary to the Ministry of Defence, a former Ambassador to Russia, and officials from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, with plans for prompt departure to Russia. State Minister Balasuriya made this announcement during a press briefing titled Collective Path to a Stable Country, held at the President Media Centre (PMC) this morning. Addressing the media personnel, the state minister further stated; At present, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Defence are collaborating on a census of Sri Lankans caught amidst the Russian-Ukrainian war. It has been revealed that certain Sri Lankans entered Russia on tourist visas. Among them, were a significant number of retired military personnel who served in the tri-forces in Sri Lanka. The primary challenge lies in determining the exact number of individuals in Russia. As per unofficial sources, approximately 600, 800 Sri Lankan individuals are in Russia. Notably, the government has been proactive in addressing the situation concerning retired military personnel in Russia. Gratitude is extended to media institutes for their assistance in identifying those involved in the war in Russia. However, a pressing issue remains, which is the lack of specific information regarding the exact locations where these individuals are residing in Russia. Based on available information, it has come to our attention that smugglers have deceitfully transported individuals to Russia, attracting them with false promises such as the prospect of acquiring Russian citizenship. This is definitely human trafficking. Furthermore, reports indicate the involvement of a senior military officer in this incident. It is imperative to accurately assess the situation and halt the dispatch of personnel to Russia. Thereafter, diplomatic discussions should be held to facilitate the return of those already in Russia back to Sri Lanka. The government is actively engaged in these endeavours. Despite the Minister of Foreign Affairs being overseas, President Ranil Wickremesinghe has directed the formation of the delegation to investigate the situation of Sri Lankans affected by the Russian-Ukraine war. This delegation, consisting of officials from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, including the Secretary to the Ministry of Defence and the former Ambassador to Russia, is expected to be dispatched to Russia, with official notification to be provided to the Russian Embassy regarding this initiative. Meanwhile, Sri Lankas State Minister of Defence Pramitha Bandara Tennakoon said yesterday that at least 16 Sri Lankan military veteran have been killed fighting in the war between Russia and Ukraine. Sri Lanka opened an inquiry last week into the recruitment of its citizens for the conflict that has since identified the participation of 288 retired soldiers from the island nation, he said. We have confirmed information about 16 who have been killed, he told reporters in Colombo. Tennakoon did not say which side of the conflict the soldiers had been fighting on. But ruling party lawmaker Gamini Waleboda told parliament on Monday that most had been recruited to fight alongside the Russian army. Those who joined had been duped with promises of high salaries and falsely told they would be given non-combat roles, Waleboda said. Tennakoon said the recruitment of Sri Lankans was being treated as a human trafficking enterprise and urged military officers not to fall prey to the recruitment drive. The Sri Lankan government was also in talks with both the Ukrainian and Russian foreign ministries to track down Sri Lankans in the two countries and bring them back safely. This is a delicate issue, Tennakoon said. We are friends with Russia, we are friends with Ukraine. Both are important for us so we are talking to the foreign ministries to get our people back safely. Complaints began pouring in from relatives after the defense ministry established its probe last week to collect information on those who had traveled to both countries to join the war effort. Sri Lanka has repeatedly warned its citizens against traveling to Russia or Ukraine to join the fighting. Tennakoon emphasized the stringent enforcement of the law against individuals involved in human trafficking. He highlighted that severe penalties would be imposed on those found guilty, regardless of their social status and standing. Additionally, the State Minister revealed that a group of suspects, including a retired senior military officer, has been arrested under suspicion of participating in human trafficking. Allegedly, they employed retired army personnel as soldiers in the Russian-Ukraine war. Legal proceedings have commenced against them, he assured. They have been promoting human trafficking through social media campaigns, attracting victims with promises of high salaries and other privileges. As a result, individuals have fallen prey to this trafficking in successive waves. The government urges the public to remain vigilant against such manipulative tactics. The public is requested to contact 0112 401 146 if they possess any information about human trafficking, he added.",
