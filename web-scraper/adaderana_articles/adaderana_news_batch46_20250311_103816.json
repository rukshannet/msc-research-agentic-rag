        "title": "Italy row, AI in focus at worlds biggest book fair",
        "date": "October 17, 2024 11:22 am",
        "content": "An eclectic range of topics will be in focus at the worlds biggest book fair, which opens today, from a row over an Italian mafia author to growing interest in wacky literary subgenres and artificial intelligence in publishing. The Frankfurt Book Fair brings together authors, publishers and other industry players over five days in the western German city. Big names include Israeli author and historian Yuval Noah Harari, best known for Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind, US writer Anne Applebaum and British-Turkish novelist Elif Shafak. However, the run-up has been marred by a row in Italy, this years guest of honor, an annual tradition intended to shine a spotlight on a partner countrys literary scene. Fury erupted after the initial official selection put forward by the Italians did not include Roberto Saviano, author of mafia bestseller Gomorrah, who was convicted and fined last year for defaming Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni. Following the move, Saviano lashed out on social media at what he branded the most ignorant government in the history of Italy. In the end he is coming to the fair anyway, but at the invitation of his German publisher. Critics say it is further evidence of a worsening climate for freedom of expression in Italy, with 41 authors writing an open letter in response that complained of increasingly suffocating political interference in cultural spaces. The Italian Publishers Association insisted that it would never allow any kind of outside interference in the program, called Roots in the future. The fair is no stranger to controversy  last year, several publishers from Muslim-majority countries withdrew in protest at organizers strong support for Israel following Hamas Oct. 7 attacks that triggered the Gaza war. Fair director Juergen Boos insisted it was right to maintain Italy as guest of honor, despite the controversy. I think to showcase whats happening in Italys culture right now, in Italys politics, it is very important, he said. There is much more going on besides the controversy surrounding Italy  the worlds biggest publishing trade event this year welcomes about 1,000 authors and other speakers at some 650 events on 15 stages. A large area is dedicated to new adult literature, which encompasses a weird and outlandish range of sub-genres beloved of younger readers, such as Romantasy and Dark College. These genres have been rapidly growing in popularity, often boosted by exposure through social media trend BookTok on the TikTok platform, where authors promote their work and readers post reviews. Artificial intelligence will also be a major topic, with talks and panel discussions dedicated to the subject, as fears mount in the industry about poor-quality, computer-written books flooding the market and potential copyright violations. Leading authors, including John Grisham and Jodi Picoult, have in recent times taken legal action against OpenAI, alleging the company unlawfully used their works to train its popular AI chatbot ChatGPT. Still it is not all doom and gloom. There are hopes that AI can improve efficiency for publishers and also that it could be beneficial in some areas, such as scientific and research publishing. On the one side its beneficial for the workflows in the publishing houses, Boos said. On the other hand, regarding copyright, its a big mess. An annual highlight is the awarding of the prestigious Peace of the German Book Trade, which this year goes to Applebaum, an American-Polish journalist and historian whose latest book Autocracy Inc examines the growing links between authoritarian states.

        "title": "Former Presidents CBK, Maithripala and Ranil share same stage",
        "date": "October 17, 2024 12:22 pm",
        "content": "The 45th National Conference of Chartered Accountants took place yesterday (16) in Colombo, featuring a rare gathering of three former Presidents of Sri LankaChandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga, Maithripala Sirisena, and Ranil Wickremesingheon the same stage. The former leaders shared their views on the countrys political landscape and answered questions presented to them at the conference, making the event a highlight in the nations political discourse. Speaking during the event, former President Maithripala Sirisena reflected on the political state of the country, emphasizing the need for integrity at all levels of government. He remarked: A country cannot progress simply because its ruler is good. The Prime Minister and the Cabinet must also be clean. There must be no room for corruption and fraud. I dont like some people blaming politicians that the country has been corrupt for the last 74 years. I completely reject that. Its not just about blaming politicians. Politicians should also be trained from the beginning, from the Ministry Secretary to the Presidents Secretary. The citizens must also play their part in building a better nation. Now when you go to vote, you cant work without alcohol. You need a good meal, you need a good bus. Thats the situation, Sirisena added. Advice to a Future President When asked to offer advice to a future president, each former leader shared their thoughts: Ranil Wickremesinghe spoke on leadership, drawing a comparison between corporate and political leadership.  Mr. Panditaratne became the President of UNP. He was actually like the right hand of the President. Mahaweli project was successful because of him. If they join the United National Party, these people can go up. A CEO and a president have different roles. Steve Jobs could never be President of the United States. Only Donald Trump managed to cross that line, he said. Maithripala Sirisena expressed optimism about the future, humorously saying, None of you have run for election yet, but I hope that someday one of your Chartered Accountants will become the President of this country. Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga emphasized the need for educated and capable individuals to enter politics. Doors should be opened for everyone. Educated and competent people should be encouraged to lead. I am no longer involved in politics but am focused on building new leaders, she said. Maithripala Sirisena addressed the issue of corruption within ministries, noting that it is often a collaborative effort. There are educated individuals who steal. Ministers cant engage in corruption without the knowledge of ministry secretaries and chief accountants. It becomes a chain reaction, and then they all get involved, he explained. When asked about his decision to appoint Mahinda Rajapaksa as Prime Minister during the Good Governance government, Sirisena humorously deflected, stating, I could answer that, but Im not sure if Mr. Ranil will be pleased. If anyone wants to know, they can ask me privately. It wasnt solely my decision, but I take responsibility. Being a leader means facing many tough decisions.",

        "title": "Italy makes it illegal to seek surrogacy abroad",
        "date": "October 17, 2024 12:42 pm",
        "content": "Italys parliament made it illegal on Wednesday for couples to go abroad to have a baby via surrogacy -- a pet project of Prime Ministers Giorgia Meloni party which activists say is meant to target same-sex partners. Since taking office in 2022 Meloni has pursued a highly conservative social agenda, looking to promote what she sees as traditional family values, making it progressively harder for LGBTQ couples to become legal parents. The upper house Senate voted into law a bill proposed by Melonis Brothers of Italy party by 84 votes to 58. The bill was already approved by the lower house last year. The legislation extends a surrogacy ban already in place in Italy since 2004 to those who go to countries such as the United States or Canada, where it is legal, imposing jail terms of up to two years and fines of up to 1 million euros (1.09 million). Motherhood is absolutely unique, it absolutely cannot be surrogated, and it is the foundation of our civilisation, Brothers of Italy senator Lavinia Mennuni said during the parliamentary debate. We want to uproot the phenomenon of surrogacy tourism. Earlier this year, Meloni called surrogacy an inhuman practice that treated children as supermarket products, echoing a position expressed by the Catholic Church. On Tuesday, demonstrators gathered near the Senate voicing their outrage at the bill, saying the government was lashing out at LGBTQ people and damaging those who wanted to have children despite the fact Italy has a sharply declining birth rate. If someone has a baby, they should be given a medal. Here instead you are sent to jail... if you dont have children in the traditional way, Franco Grillini, a long-time activist for LGBTQ rights in Italy, told Reuters at the demonstration. Rainbow Families President Alessia Crocini said 90 of Italians who choose surrogacy are heterosexual couples but they mostly do so in secret, meaning the new ban would de facto affect only gay couples who cannot hide it. The clampdown on surrogacy comes against the backdrop of falling birthrates, with national statistics institute ISTAT saying in March that births had dropped to a record low in 2023 -- the 15th consecutive annual decline. This is a monstrous law. No country in the world has such a thing, said Grillini, referring to the governments move to prevent Italians from taking advantage of practices that are perfectly legal in some countries.

        "title": "Amazon is joining Google and Microsoft in going big on nuclear power",
        "date": "October 17, 2024 12:56 pm",
        "content": "Amazon is joining its artificial intelligence competitors in the race for nuclear energy. The tech giant has signed three agreements to support the development of nuclear energy projects, it said Wednesday. The agreements include building several small modular reactors (SMRs). These advanced nuclear reactors have a smaller physical footprint, allowing them to be built closer to the grid, Amazon said. And compared with traditional reactors, SMRs can be put online faster because construction takes less time. Nuclear is a safe source of carbon-free energy that can help power our operations and meet the growing demands of our customers, while helping us progress toward our Climate Pledge commitment to be net-zero carbon across our operations by 2040, Matt Garman, CEO of Amazon Web Services, said in a statement. Garman said the investment in nuclear energy is an important area of investment for Amazon, because it is both carbon-free and able to scale. Amazons agreement with Washington-based Energy Northwest will produce four advanced SMRs that will be built, owned, and operated by the utilities consortium. The tech giant is also investing in SMR reactors and fuel developer X-energy, it said. X-energys design for advanced nuclear reactors will be used for Amazons project with Energy Northwest. Under Amazons agreement with Virginia-based Dominion Energy (D), the companies will develop an SMR near the utility companys North Anna Nuclear Generating Station. AI ambitions are hindering sustainability goals While the AI boom has boosted revenues for major tech companies, the technologys massive demand for energy is hindering climate change efforts. One query on ChatGPT needs almost 10 times as much electricity as a Google (GOOGL) search, according to a study by Goldman Sachs (GS). In April, Ami Badani, chief marketing officer of British chip designer Arm (ARM), said data centers powering AI chatbots such as OpenAIs ChatGPT account for 2 of global electricity consumption. That demand, Badani said, could eventually slow down AI progress. In July, Google said its carbon emissions have risen by 48 since 2019, mostly due to energy consumption by data centers and supply chain emissions. The companys carbon emissions were up 13 year over year in 2023, according to its 2024 Environmental Report. In the report, Google said it was no longer maintaining operational carbon neutrality and would turn to other carbon solutions and partnerships to reach its 2021 goal of reaching net-zero emissions across its operations and value chain by 2030. In 2020, Microsoft (MSFT) set a similar goal to be carbon negative by the end of the decade. But in May, the company said its carbon emissions were almost 31 higher than in 2020, according to its 2024 Environmental Sustainability Report. That jump was mostly due to building data centers for AI, Microsoft said, as well as due to AI hardware such as semiconductors and servers. Our challenges are in part unique to our position as a leading cloud supplier that is expanding its datacenters, Microsoft said in a statement. But, even more, we reflect the challenges the world must overcome to develop and use greener concrete, steel, fuels, and chips. Data centers, which are in demand as companies continue developing larger, more powerful models, could consume up to 9 of electricity in the U.S. by 2030  more than double what is being used now, according to the Electric Power Research Institute. Big Tech is hungry for nuclear energy Tech giants are taking notice of their growing carbon footprints. In July, the Wall Street Journal (NWS) reported that a third of the U.S.s nuclear power plants were discussing deals with tech companies to supply electricity for data centers. Among them was Amazon, which was reportedly closing in on a deal to use electricity from Constellation Energy (CEG)  the owner of most of the countrys power plants. In Amazons announcement Wednesday, it said it had made an agreement with Talen Energy to co-locate a data center facility next to the companys Pennsylvania-based nuclear facility. Earlier this week, Google announced it had signed the worlds first corporate agreement to purchase nuclear energy from SMRs developed by California-based Kairos Power. Google said it expects to bring Kairos Powers first SMR online by the end of the decade. Other reactors will be deployed through 2035. Through the deal, 500 megawatts (MW) of 247 carbon-free power will be available to U.S. electricity grids. In September, Microsoft and Constellation announced a 20-year power purchase agreement that would restart the Unit 1 reactor on Three Mile Island  close to the site of one of the worst nuclear power plant accidents ever in the U.S. Through the deal, which will launch the Crane Clean Energy Center (CCEC), Microsoft will purchase energy from the Unit 1 reactor as part of its sustainability goal. The CCEC, which is expected to come online by 2028, will add more than 800 MW of carbon-free electricity to the power grid, a study by the Pennsylvania Building and Construction Trades Council found.

        "title": "26 ships polluted Sri Lankan waters; over 6 million litres of pollutants released in one year",
        "date": "October 17, 2024 02:05 pm",
        "content": "The Maritime Environment Protection Authority (MEPA) has reported that 26 ships polluted Sri Lankan waters in the past year, based on data from a satellite monitoring project conducted in collaboration with the French government. The project, aimed at monitoring maritime pollution, uses advanced satellite technology to track and analyze incidents of marine contamination. Two major shipwrecksthe New Diamond and X-Press Pearlstand out in recent history as causes of significant environmental damage to Sri Lankas marine ecosystem. The New Diamond caught fire and sank 38 nautical miles off Sri Lankas east coast in September 2020, while the X-Press Pearl, a Singapore-registered vessel, sank near Colombo Port after catching fire in May 2021. Both incidents caused severe and long-lasting harm to marine life and coastal areas. In response to these environmental disasters, MEPA, with support from a French company, launched a pilot project to assess fuel spills in Sri Lankan waters using satellite technology. The findings from this initiative confirmed that 26 ships entering Sri Lankan waters over the past year have contributed to ocean pollution. Commenting further regarding the matter, Project Manager Oliver Germane said: When we presented these report to all the stakeholders, they were surprised by the results because probably did not expect to see so many pollutions in the national waters. In total 115 pollutions have taken place in 12 months, which means that on a rate, each time we are acquiring an image, we have more than 50 chance to see a pollution in this image. Also the estimation of the volume of pollution was taken total volume of pollutants was more than 6 million litres of pollutants released to the Sri Lankan waters. So, on a range, every month, 500,000 litres of pollutants have been released in to the waters. The amount of pollutants which was released by the incidents of the X-Press Pearl in 2021 was 350,000 litres. This means that on a rate we have an equivalent volume of pollutants the X-Press Pearl released to Sri Lankan waters every month, he added. Furthermore, Mr. Germane stated: We were also able to identify the potential polluters in some cases. For this project, we were able to do so in 26 cases. So, points to them, to take possible actions.",

During a press conference held in Colombo yesterday (16), the convener of the union, Ananda Palitha, expressed concerns over the issue. The Electricity Board has not yet provided the necessary data to the Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL) for the revision of the electricity tariffs. Currently, the CEBs net profit exceeds Rs. 155 billion. Why is there room for further exploitation? he questioned. Further, he urged the President to intervene, stating, If you are committed to the welfare of the people, you should question the CEB on what it has been doing all this time. Immediate action can be taken to revise the electricity bill, potentially reducing it by at least 45 percent.",

        "content": "The leader of the United National Party (UNP), former President Ranil Wickremesinghe has called on voters to elect to the Parliament candidates with proven experience in managing economic crises as the country faces ongoing challenges. Making a special statement ahead of the upcoming parliamentary election, Wickremesinghe emphasized that those who have worked with him over the past two years are best suited to guide the nation forward. In these difficult times, it is vital that we have leaders in Parliament who know how to handle an economic crisis. Whether you are in the opposition or part of the government, without this experience, you will fail to meet the countrys goals, Wickremesinghe said. I urge the supporters of all political parties to vote for our experienced candidates, he added. Wickremesinghe also made a special appeal to those who did not vote in the previous election that in order to solve the countrys economic problem and move forward, the experienced people should be in the Parliament. He stressed that the future of the country depends on electing leaders with the right skills to solve the economic issues and ensure the nations recovery. Highlighting his leadership in the previous presidential election, where he ran under the symbol of the gas cylinder with broad support from representatives of diverse political parties including the UNP, the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP), and other political groups, Wickremesinghe noted that this coalition continues to stand strong. A portion of those MPs and UNP officials who worked with me are now joining together in this election under the New Democratic Front. With their experience and dedication, they will ensure the success of this new parliamentary term, he added. Wickremesinghe concluded his statement by urging citizens to cast their valuable vote for the candidates with the expertise to lead the nation through this crucial period, stating, If we succeed in this effort, we can rebuild the country and secure a better future for all.",

        "content": "Bangladeshs International Crimes Tribunal on Thursday issued an arrest warrant for former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, citing her alleged involvement in mass killings during violent protests that erupted earlier this year. The protests, which began as a student-led movement against public sector job quotas, escalated into some of the deadliest unrest since the countrys independence in 1971, resulting in over 700 deaths and numerous injuries. The violence ultimately forced Hasina to flee to India on Aug. 5 and an interim government led by Nobel Peace Prize laureate Muhammad Yunus took charge. The tribunals proceedings, presided over by Justice Golam Mortuza Majumdar, saw prosecutors request arrest warrants for 50 individuals, including Hasina. I appealed to the court that if the accused, who are extremely influential, are not arrested, it will be impossible to conduct the investigation, chief prosecutor Mohammad Tajul Islam said. To date, more than 60 complaints have been filed against Hasina and other leaders of her Awami League party, alleging enforced disappearances, murder, and mass killings. Party leaders from the Awami League were not immediately available for comment, as many senior members have either been arrested or have gone into hiding. However, Hasinas son, Sajeeb Wazed, told Reuters last month that his mother was ready to face trial in Bangladesh, adding: My mother has done nothing wrong. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "date": "October 17, 2024 10:15 pm",
        "content": "The government has spent only 53 of the welfare budget allocated for the year within the first 8 months up to August, according to a report. A latest report from the Ministry of Finance indicates that the welfare budget has primarily been used to fund the Aswesuma welfare program. Meanwhile, the report also states that Sri Lanka is expected to receive 1.69 billion US dollars in loans from multilateral agencies within the next 3 to 5 years. In the Pre-election budgetary report by the Finance ministry, it is reported that, as of the end of August 2024, foreign development partners and lending agencies have entered into 10 agreements with the government for foreign financing totalling 398.7 million US dollars. Of this amount, 350 million dollars has been secured in the form of loans. Another 48.7 million dollars has been obtained through seven grant agreements with the governments of Japan and Australia under official development assistance. Meanwhile, total foreign financing disbursements up to August 2024 amount to 1.01 billion dollars, of which 994.4 million dollars has been disbursed as loans while 11.3 million has been provided as grants. The Asian Development Bank has disbursed 358.3 million dollars to Sri Lanka up to August 2024, slightly surpassing the International Monetary Fund, which has provided 334 million dollars in budget support loans. The World Bank has contributed 239.8 million dollars. The ADB and World Bank have linked their budget support loans to Sri Lankas IMF program from last year. A significant portion of the disbursements has been utilized in the budget support sector, accounting for 33 of the total disbursements. The power and energy sector has utilized 13, while the SME development sector has received 10, and the finance sector has utilized 7. Additionally, the report stated that there is another 1.69 billion dollars in loans from multilateral agencies that has not yet been disbursed, and these funds are expected to be available in the next 3 to 5 years. The report also showed that only 53 of Sri Lankas welfare budget has been utilized in the first eight months of 2024. According to the report data 562.4 billion rupees out of the welfare budgeted 1,055.7 billion has been spent during this period. The previous government increased the welfare budget by 15.3 this year compared to the actual expenditure of 915.4 billion rupees in 2023, as per the data, following the IMF recommendations.

        "content": "Sri Lanka thrashed West Indies by 9 wickets on Thursday (October 17) to take the series by 2-1. Maheesh Theekshana and Wanindu Hasaranga chipped in with 2 wickets each to help the hosts restrict West Indies to 162 runs. In reply, both Kusal Mendis and Kusal Perera brought up magnificent fifties to take the series. Opting to bat first, West Indies had a terrible start as they were crumbling on 55-4 after the halfway stage, adding some runs to it they lost another and soon became 62-5. This walked in, Gudakesh Motie, who slammed three sixes to uplift West Indies and smashed a quick-fire 32 off 15 balls. After his departure, captain Rovman Powell too showcased his power hitting skills and he got some timely boundaries to score 37 off 27 balls and help his side finish on 162 on the board. In reply, Sri Lanka started off to a flier. Openers Pathum Nissanka and Kusal Mendis teed off the West Indian bowlers with their power pack batting. The duo added 67 runs inside the powerplay before the former one fell to Motie after his brisk 39 off 22 balls. And then Kusal Mendis and Kusal Perera stitched an incredible partnership together, they strung for 106 runs off 76 balls. Both of them notched up fifties together and steered Sri Lanka home with superb authority. Kusal Perera was unbeaten on 55 off 36 balls, while Kusal Mendis made 68 off 50 deliveries. This is, however, Sri Lankas maiden T20I series victory over the West Indies. Source: BDCrictime --Agencies",

        "title": "Kenyas deputy president sacked while in hospital",
        "date": "October 18, 2024 08:54 am",
        "content": "Kenyan senators have voted to remove Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua from office despite his failure to testify at his impeachment trial after his lawyer said he had been taken to hospital. In one of the most dramatic days in Kenyas recent political history, Gachagua had been due to appear in the Senate after lunch to defend himself, a day after he had pleaded not guilty to 11 charges. However, Gachagua, popularly known as Riggy G, did not show up and his lawyer requested a postponement saying his client was suffering from chest pains and was being treated by doctors at The Karen Hospital. Senators chose to continue the trial without him, prompting the defence team to leave the chamber. The senators refusal to delay proceedings until Saturday - as long as would have been legally allowed - shows how determined they were to get rid of Gachagua, several months after he fell out with President William Ruto. Last week, an overwhelming majority of MPs in the National Assembly - the lower house of parliament - voted to impeach him, setting the stage for his two-day trial in the Senate. Gachagua, a wealthy businessman from the vote-rich central Mount Kenya region who was present in the house in the morning, has described the impeachment as a political lynching. On Thursday evening, the required two-thirds of the 67 senators upheld five charges including inciting ethnic divisions and and violating his oath of office - enough for him to to be removed from office. He was cleared of six charges including corruption and money-laundering. This comes just two years after Ruto and Gachagua were elected on a joint ticket. The vote draws a line under months of infighting at the top level of government and consolidates Rutos hold on power. The row came to a head in June when Gachagua, in an act seen as undermining the president, blamed the head of the intelligence agency for not properly briefing Ruto and the government over the magnitude of mass protests against unpopular tax hikes. In a huge blow to his authority, Ruto had just been forced to withdraw the taxes. He sacked his cabinet and brought in members of the opposition to his government. Ruto has not commented on the impeachment of his deputy. At the start of the trial, one of Gachaguas lawyers, Elisha Ongoya, said all of the allegations were either false, ridiculous or embarrassing. Before the vote, Gachagua had said he would challenge the decision if it passed. A doctor is quoted by the Reuters news agency as saying the 59-year-old had gone to hospital with heart trouble, but was stable and undergoing tests. Kenyan media have already been reporting about his possible replacements, with four people mentioned:  Muranga County Governor Irungu Kangata  Kirinyaga County Governor Anne Waiguru  Interior Minister Kithure Kindiki  Foreign Affairs Minister Musalia Mudavadi.

        "content": "K-pop star J-Hope, a member of the supergroup BTS, was discharged from South Koreas military on Thursday after 18 months of duty, sparking enthusiasm among fans and investors for a potential reunion of the boy band next year. J-Hope, 30, is the second member of the seven-member group to wrap up the mandatory national service that has put their music careers on hold, after oldest member Jin finished his service in June. Wearing a uniform and a black beret, J-Hope smiled as he greeted Jin and around 100 cheering fans as well as reporters upon his release at a military base in Wonju, Gangwon province. Thanks to the fans, I was able to finish it (the service) safely, with good health, he told those gathered. What Ive felt for the past a year-and-a-half is that a lot of soldiers are working hard, dedicating themselves, and doing so much to protect the country, he added, asking the public for their interest and love for those serving in the military. The final four members of the group began their service in December 2023, with the band expected to reunite in 2025 after all have completed their military duty. Im really hoping to see them (all BTS members) again together, said Constanza Godoy, 33-year-old Chilean fan who went to see J-Hope leave the military. I think that after this short time apart they will be more close, and they will bring more stories to their songs, to their lyrics. BTS ranks 41th among best-selling artists of all time according to chartmasters.org on a list headed by The Beatles. Since their debut in 2013, they have sold more than 56 million physical albums and singles, and tallied six No. 1 albums on the Billboard 200, according to chartmasters.org and Billboard. South Korea requires all able-bodied men between the ages of 18 and 28 to serve between 18 and 21 months in the military or social service, but it revised the law in 2020 to let globally recognised K-pop stars delay signing up until age 30.

We urge the government to appoint a committee and establish a transparent pricing formula, Mr. Marasinghe said. He further noted that the actual production cost of an egg is between Rs. 20 and Rs. 23, while farm-gate prices currently stand at around Rs. 30.

Officials said the overloaded boat carrying migrants started sinking off the coast of Wissant in northern France. Rescuers called to the scene saved 65 people, including some who were in the water. Searches to find more people at sea found an unconscious baby, who was later declared dead, officials said. The local prefecture said in a statement: Rescuers found that the boat, which was heavily loaded, was in difficulty and that some of the people were in the water. Rescuers began to recover the people in difficulty. At the same time, further searches were carried out to find people who could be stranded at sea. It was then that the baby was discovered, the prefecture added. Prosecutors have opened an investigation into the death. 2024 is already the deadliest year for migrant crossings of the English Channel since 2018. Dinghies often now carry 50 or more migrants, far more than in previous years. Many do not wear life jackets for the dangerous crossing. On 3 September, six children and a pregnant woman were among 12 people who died after a boat carrying dozens of people sank off the French coast. A month later, four people, including a two-year-old boy, died after seemingly being trampled to death on two separate boats. The latest sinking brings the total number of deaths from migrants attempting to cross the Channel this year to at least 53. UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has said he is absolutely determined to tackle the smuggling gangs facilitating the crossings. According to Home Office figures, more than 26,000 migrants have arrived in Britain on small boats since the start of the year. The International Organisation for Migration (IOM) has said deaths in the Channel are preventable. Source: BBC --Agencies",

        "content": "Russia is testing the combat readiness of a unit equipped with Yars intercontinental ballistic missiles in a region northwest of Moscow, news agencies quoted the defence ministry as saying on Friday. The Yars, which can be deployed in silos or mounted on mobile launchers, has a range of up to 11,000 km (6,835 miles) and is capable of delivering multiple nuclear warheads. Russia has carried out a series of nuclear drills this year in what security analysts say are signals intended to deter the West from intervening more deeply in the war in Ukraine. The latest one is taking place in the same week that NATO conducted its annual nuclear exercise and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy unveiled his victory plan. Russian President Vladimir Putin said last month that Moscow had extended the list of scenarios that could prompt it to use nuclear weapons, effectively lowering the threshold for their use. Ukraine accused Moscow of nuclear blackmail. In the latest test, a unit in the Tver region will practise moving Yars missiles in the field over distances of up to 100 km (62 miles) under camouflage and protecting them against air attack and enemy sabotage groups, Interfax quoted the defence ministry as saying. Russia previously conducted two rounds of exercises involving Yars missile units in July. It has also held three sets of drills this year to test preparations for the launch of tactical nuclear missiles, which have a shorter range and lower yield than intercontinental strategic rockets. In the course of the war, Putin has issued frequent reminders that Russia has the worlds biggest nuclear arsenal, but he has insisted that it does not need to resort to nuclear weapons in order to achieve victory in Ukraine.

        "date": "October 18, 2024 07:27 pm",
        "content": "Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahus promises to press on with Israels wars in Gaza and Lebanon dashed hopes on Friday that the killing of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar might help end more than a year of escalating conflict in the Middle East. Lebanese militant group Hezbollah meanwhile vowed to escalate fighting against Israel and its backer Iran said the spirit of resistance would be strengthened by the death of its Palestinian ally Sinwar in Gaza. Sinwar, a mastermind of the Oct. 7, 2023, attack that triggered the Gaza war, was killed during an operation by Israeli soldiers in the Palestinian enclave on Wednesday, a pivotal event in the year-long conflict. Netanyahu called Sinwars killing a milestone late on Thursday but vowed to keep up the war, which in recent weeks expanded from fighting against Palestinian group Hamas in Gaza into an invasion of southern Lebanon and the bombardment of large swathes of the country. The war, my dear ones, is not yet over, Netanyahu told Israelis, saying fighting would continue until hostages held by Hamas are released. We have before us a great opportunity to stop the axis of evil and create a different future, he added, referring to Iran and its militant allies across the region in Gaza, Lebanon, Syria, Iraq and Yemen. Netanyahus comments contrasted with Western leaders, including U.S. President Joe Biden, who said Sinwars death offered a chance for the conflict to end. The U.S. wants to kick-start ceasefire talks and secure the release of hostages, U.S. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said, adding that Sinwar had been refusing to negotiate. That obstacle has obviously been removed. Cant predict that that means whoever replaces (Sinwar) will agree to a ceasefire, but it does remove what has been in recent months the chief obstacle to getting one, he said. One senior diplomat working in Lebanon told Reuters that hopes Sinwars death would end the war appeared misplaced. We had hoped, really throughout this, that getting rid of Sinwar would be the turning point where the wars would end ... where everyone would be ready to put their weapons down. It appears we were once again mistaken, the diplomat said. Months of efforts by Israels chief backer the United States to broker ceasefires with Hamas and Hezbollah have failed as Israel has pressed on with its wars, and its arch foe Iran has looked largely powerless to match Israels military might, including U.S. weapons. The conflict has caused the first direct Iranian-Israeli confrontations, including missile attacks on Israel in April and Oct. 1. Netanyahu has vowed to respond to the October attack, which caused little damage. Washington has pressed Israel to limit targets and not strike Iranian energy facilities or nuclear sites. TRACKED AND KILLED Sinwar, Hamas overall leader following the assassination of political chief Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran in July, was believed to have been hiding in the warren of tunnels Hamas has built under Gaza over the past two decades. He was killed during a gun battle on Wednesday by Israeli troops initially unaware they had caught their number one enemy, Israeli officials said. The military released drone video of what it said was Sinwar, sitting on an armchair and covered in dust inside a destroyed building. He was tracked by the drone as he lay dying, the video showed. As the drone hovered nearby, the video showed him throwing a stick at it, in an apparent act of desperation. Hamas has not made any comment, but sources within the group have said the indications they have seen suggest Sinwar was indeed killed. He masterminded the Oct. 7, 2023 attacks in southern Israel that killed some 1,200 people, according to Israeli authorities. Israel responded by invading Gaza, so far killing more than 42,000 people, according to Palestinian officials. Hezbollah, which began firing rockets at Israel in support of its Hamas ally on Oct. 8, is the target of Israels intensifying assault on Lebanon, which has killed more than 2,000 people and displaced 1.2 million. Israel has now killed several of Hamas top leaders and in a matter of weeks decapitated the Hezbollah leadership , mainly through air strikes. The killings have dealt a blow to what anti-Israeli forces call the Axis of Resistance: a group of proxy militant groups that Iran has spent decades supporting across the region. Iran showed no sign Sinwars killing would shift its support. The spirit of resistance will be strengthened, its mission to the United Nations said. Hezbollah was also defiant, announcing the transition to a new and escalating phase in the confrontation with Israel. The Israeli military said on Friday it had also killed Muhammad Hassin Ramal, Hezbollahs commander of the Tayibe area in southern Lebanon. Families of Israeli hostages said that while the killing of Sinwar was an achievement, it would not be complete while captives are still in Gaza. Avi Marciano, father of Noa Marciano, who was killed in captivity by Hamas, told Israeli broadcaster KAN that the monster, the one who took her from me, who had the blood of all our daughters on his hands, finally met the gates of hell.

        "title": "Israel and Hamas signal resistance to ending Gaza war after Sinwars death",
        "date": "October 19, 2024 08:03 am",
        "content": "Hamas confirmed Friday that its leader, Yahya Sinwar, was killed by Israeli forces in Gaza and reiterated its stance that hostages the militant group took from Israel a year ago will not be released until there is a cease-fire in Gaza and a withdrawal of Israeli troops. The groups staunch position pushed back against a statement by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin a day earlier that his countrys military will keep fighting until the hostages are released and will remain in Gaza to prevent a severely weakened Hamas from rearming. The conflicting stands signal continued deep resistance on both sides to ending the war, even as President Joe Biden and other world leaders press the case that Sinwars death is a turning point that should be used to unlock stalled cease-fire negotiations. The standoff comes as Israels war with Lebanons Hezbollah a Hamas ally backed by Iran has intensified in recent weeks. Hezbollah said Friday it planned to launch a new phase of fighting by sending more guided missiles and exploding drones into Israel. The militant groups longtime leader, Hassan Nasrallah, was killed in an Israeli airstrike late last month, and Israel sent ground troops into Lebanon earlier this month. Sinwar, the former lead of Hamas, died confronting the occupation army until the last moment of his life, said his Qatar-based deputy, Khalil al-Hayya, who represented Hamas during several rounds of cease-fire negotiations. Hamas will not return any of the hostages, al-Hayya said, before the end of the aggression on Gaza and the withdrawal from Gaza. Hamas heralded Sinwar in a statement, calling him a hero for not retreating, brandishing his weapon, engaging and confronting the occupation army at the forefront of the ranks. The statement appeared to refer to a video the Israeli military circulated of Sinwars apparent last moments in which a man sits on a chair in severely damaged building, badly wounded and covered in dust. In the video, the man raises his hand and flings a stick at an approaching Israeli drone. Sinwar was the chief architect of the Hamas raid on Israel last year that killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and kidnapped another 250. Israels retaliatory offensive in Gaza has killed over 42,000 Palestinians, according to local health authorities, who do not distinguish combatants from civilians but say more than half the dead are women and children. The war has destroyed vast swaths of Gaza, displaced about 90 of its population of 2.3 million people and has left them struggling to find food, water, medicine and fuel. Sinwars killing appeared to be a chance front-line encounter with Israeli troops on Wednesday, and it could shift the dynamics of the Gaza war even as Israel presses its offensive against Hezbollah with ground troops in southern Lebanon and airstrikes in other areas of the country. Hezbollah has fired rockets into Israel nearly every day since the Israel-Hamas war began, displacing tens of thousands of Israelis from their homes in the countrys north. More than 1 million people in Lebanon have been displaced by Israels aerial bombardment and ground offensive. Iran, which also supports Hamas, hailed Sinwar Friday as a martyr who can inspire others in challenging Israel. We, and countless others around the world, salute his selfless struggle for liberation of the Palestinian people, Irans foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, wrote on the X social media platform. Martyrs live forever, and the cause for liberation of Palestine from occupation is more alive than ever. Israel has pledged to destroy Hamas politically in Gaza, and killing Sinwar was a top military priority. But Netanyahu said in a speech announcing the killing Thursday night that our war is not yet ended. Still, the governments of Israels allies and exhausted residents of Gaza expressed hope that Sinwars death would pave the way for an end to the war. U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said Friday Sinwars death provides an extraordinary opportunity to achieve a lasting cease-fire and suggested the U.S. could have a role in helping to stabilize Gaza in the future. Hopefully countries in the region will step up there, Austin said at a NATO meeting in Brussels. Italys Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, meeting with her counterpart in Lebanon, said European countries are working for a sustainable cease-fire in both that country and in Gaza. Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati said a diplomatic solution should overcome the fighting. But a day after Biden labeled Sinwars death an opportunity for a day after in Gaza without Hamas in power, he acknowledged the difficulty of forging a cease-fire there, saying it might be easier to negotiate a stop to the fighting in Lebanon. Its going to be harder in Gaza, Biden told reporters Friday after meeting with European leaders in Berlin. A White House national security spokesman, John Kirby, said it was too soon to assess who Hamas might anoint as Sinwars successor and what that individual may be willing to pursue. In Israel, families of hostages still held in Gaza demanded the Israeli government use Sinwars killing as a way to restart negotiations to bring home their loved ones. There are about 100 hostages remaining in Gaza, at least 30 of whom Israel says are dead. We are at an inflection point where the goals set for the war with Gaza have been achieved, all but the release of the hostages, Ronen Neutra, father of the Israeli-American hostage Omer Neutra, said in a video statement. Sinwar, who was described as a major obstacle to a deal, is no longer alive. Netanyahu was planning to convene a special meeting Friday to discuss hostage negotiations, an Israeli official with knowledge of the negotiations said. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss confidential information. Israels military said Friday it allowed 30 trucks of food, water, medical and other supplies into northern Gaza, as the country faces pressure from the U.S. to ramp up aid. There was no immediate confirmation from the U.N. that the aid arrived and was being distributed in the north. In Lebanon, Hezbollah issued a statement early Friday saying its fighters have used new types of precision-guided missiles and explosive drones against Israel for the first time in recent days. The statement appeared to refer to an explosives-laden drone that evaded Israels multilayered air-defense system and slammed into a mess hall at a military training camp deep inside Israel last Sunday, killing four soldiers and wounding dozens. The group announced earlier this week it fired a new type of missile called Qader 2 toward the suburbs of Tel Aviv. The Israeli military said Friday it would activate an additional reserve brigade to the north of its country to support troops battling in southern Lebanon. The Lebanese health ministry said six people were killed in the past 24 hours of fighting, bringing the death toll over the past year to 2,418, a quarter of whom were women and children. On Friday Israel said its forces killed two militants who crossed into Israeli territory south of the Dead Sea from neighboring Jordan. Such infiltrations are relatively rare, especially as Israel has ramped up border security since the Hamas attack in October 2023. Source: AP --Agencies",

        "content": "Israels government said a drone was launched toward the prime ministers house Saturday, with no casualties as Irans supreme leader vowed that Hamas would continue its fight against Israel following the killing of the mastermind of last years deadly Oct. 7 attack. In Gaza, at least 21 people were killed in several Israeli strikes, including children, according to hospital officials and an AP reporter. Sirens wailed Saturday morning in Israel, warning of incoming fire from Lebanon, with a drone launched toward Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahus house in Caesarea, the Israeli government said. Neither he nor his wife were home and there were no casualties, said his spokesperson in a statement. In September, Yemens Houthi rebels launched a ballistic missile toward Ben Gurion Airport when Netanyahus plane was landing. The missile was intercepted. Saturdays strikes into Israel come as its war with Lebanons Hezbollah a Hamas ally backed by Iran has intensified in recent weeks. Hezbollah said Friday that it planned to launch a new phase of fighting by sending more guided missiles and exploding drones into Israel. The militant groups longtime leader, Hassan Nasrallah, was killed in an Israeli airstrike in late September, and Israel sent ground troops into Lebanon earlier in October. In addition to the drone launched at Netanyahus residence, Israels military said some 55 projectiles were fired in two separate barrages at northern Israel from Lebanon on Saturday morning. Some were intercepted, the army said, and there were no immediate reports of any casualties. Israel also said Saturday it killed Hezbollahs deputy commander in the southern town of Bint Jbeil. The army said Nasser Rashid supervised attacks against Israel In Lebanon, the health ministry said an Israeli airstrike Saturday hit a vehicle on a main highway north of Beirut, killing two people. It was unclear who was in the car when it was struck. A standoff is also ensuing between Israel and Hamas, which its fighting in Gaza, with both signaling resistance to ending the war after the death of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar this week. On Friday, Irans supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said Sinwars death was a painful loss but noted that Hamas carried on despite the killings of other Palestinian militant leaders before him. Hamas is alive and will stay alive, Khamenei said. Since Israel claimed Sinwars death Thursday and a top Hamas political official confirmed the death Friday, Hamas has reiterated its stance that the hostages they took from Israel a year ago will not be released until there is a cease-fire in Gaza and a withdrawal of Israeli troops.

More strikes pounded Gaza on Saturday. The Palestinian Health Ministry said in a statement that Israeli strikes hit the upper floors of the Indonesian Hospital in Beit Lahiya, and that forces opened fire at the hospitals building and its courtyard, causing panic among patients and medical staff. At the Awda hospital in Jabaliya, strikes hit the buildings top floors, injuring several staff members, the hospital said in a statement. In central Gaza, at least 10 people were killed, including two children, when a house was hit in the town of Zawayda, according to the al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital where the casualties were taken. An Associated Press reporter counted the bodies at the hospital. Another strike killed 11 people, all from the same family, in the Maghazi refugee camp, according to the al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in Deir al-Balah, where they were taken. An Associated Press journalist counted the bodies at the hospital.

The airline sources also claimed that five flights each being operated by Air Asia and SpiceJet also received security alerts, leading to disruption in their regular operation. An Air India Express flight (IX-196) flying from Dubai to Jaipur made an emergency landing at the Jaipur International Airport after it received a bomb threat via email during the wee hours of Saturday. The authorities confirmed that nothing suspicious was found after the plane landed in Jaipur with 189 passengers on board. Further investigation into the matter is underway. Earlier in the day, a London-bound Vistara flight from Delhi (UK17) was diverted to Frankfurt, Germany, after a bomb threat. In a statement early Saturday morning, an airline spokesperson said the flight landed safely at the Frankfurt airport and mandatory checks were conducted. Since Monday, at least 35 flights have been diverted or forced into emergency after receiving such threats, prompting the Indian civil aviation ministry and authorities to implement stricter norms to deal with such situations. --With Agencies inputs",

        "date": "October 20, 2024 07:57 am",
        "content": "Authorities said at least seven people were killed Saturday when part of a ferry dock collapsed on Georgias Sapelo Island, where crowds had gathered for a fall celebration by the islands tiny Gullah-Geechee community of Black slave descendants. Eight people were taken to hospitals, at least six of them with critical injuries, and crews from the U.S. Coast Guard, the McIntosh County Fire Department, the Georgia Department of Natural Resources and others were searching the water, according to Natural Resources spokesperson Tyler Jones. The agency operates the dock and ferry boats that transport people between the island and the mainland. A gangway at the dock collapsed, sending people plunging into the water, Jones said. A team of engineers and construction specialists planned to be on site early Sunday to begin investigating why the walkway failed, he said. There was no collision with a boat or anything else, Jones said. The thing just collapsed. We dont know why. Helicopters and boats with side-scanning sonar were used in the search, according to a Department of Natural Resources statement. Among the dead was a chaplain for the state agency, Jones said. There were at least 20 people on the gangway when it collapsed, he said. The gangway connected an outer dock where people board the ferry to another dock onshore. Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp said he and his family were heartbroken by todays tragedy on Sapelo Island. As state and local first responders continue to work this active scene, we ask that all Georgians join us in praying for those lost, for those still in harms way, and for their families, Kemp said on the social platform X. President Joe Biden said federal officials were ready to provide any assistance needed. What should have been a joyous celebration of Gullah-Geechee culture and history instead turned into tragedy and devastation, Biden said in a statement. Jill and I mourn those who lost their lives, and we pray for the injured and anyone still missing. We are also grateful to the first responders at the scene. Sapelo Island is about 60 miles (97 kilometers) south of Savannah, reachable from the mainland by boat. The deadly collapse happened as island residents, family members and tourists gathered for Cultural Day, an annual fall event spotlighting the islands tiny community of Hogg Hummock, home to a few dozen Black residents. The community of dirt roads and modest homes was founded after the Civil War by former slaves from the cotton plantation of Thomas Spalding. Hogg Hummocks slave descendants are extremely close, having been bonded by family, bonded by history and bonded by struggle, said Roger Lotson, the only Black member of the McIntosh County Board of Commissioners. His district includes Sapelo Island. Everyone is family, and everyone knows each other, Lotson said. In any tragedy, especially like this, they are all one. Theyre all united. They all feel the same pain and the same hurt. Small communities descended from enslaved island populations in the South known as Gullah, or Geechee in Georgia are scattered along the coast from North Carolina to Florida. Scholars say their separation from the mainland caused residents to retain much of their African heritage, from their unique dialect to skills and crafts such as cast-net fishing and weaving baskets. In 1996, Hogg Hummock, also known as Hog Hammock, was placed on the National Register of Historic Places, the official list of the United States treasured historic sites. But the communitys population has been shrinking for decades, and some families have sold their land to outsiders who built vacation homes. Tax increases and zoning changes by the local government in McIntosh County have been met by protests and lawsuits by Hogg Hummock residents and landowners. They have been battling for the past year to undo zoning changes approved by county commissioners in September 2023 that doubled the size of homes allowed in Hogg Hummock. Residents say they fear larger homes will lead to tax increases that could force them to sell land their families have held for generations. Source: AP --Agencies",

        "title": "US to probe Teslas Full Self-Driving system after pedestrian killed in low visibility conditions",
        "date": "October 20, 2024 09:49 am",
        "content": "The U.S. governments road safety agency is investigating Teslas Full Self-Driving system after getting reports of crashes in low-visibility conditions, including one that killed a pedestrian. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said in documents that it opened the probe on Thursday after the company reported four crashes when Teslas encountered sun glare, fog and airborne dust. In addition to the pedestrians death, another crash involved an injury, the agency said. Investigators will look into the ability of Full Self-Driving to detect and respond appropriately to reduced roadway visibility conditions, and if so, the contributing circumstances for these crashes. The investigation covers roughly 2.4 million Teslas from the 2016 through 2024 model years. A message was left Friday seeking comment from Tesla, which has repeatedly said the system cannot drive itself and human drivers must be ready to intervene at all times. Last week Tesla held an event at a Hollywood studio to unveil a fully autonomous robotaxi without a steering wheel or pedals. Musk, who has promised autonomous vehicles before, said the company plans to have autonomous Models Y and 3 running without human drivers next year. Robotaxis without steering wheels would be available in 2026 starting in California and Texas, he said. The investigations impact on Teslas self-driving ambitions isnt clear. NHTSA would have to approve any robotaxi without pedals or a steering wheel, and its unlikely that would happen while the investigation is in progress. But if the company tries to deploy autonomous vehicles in its existing models, that likely would fall to state regulations. There are no federal regulations specifically focused on autonomous vehicles, although they must meet broader safety rules. NHTSA also said it would look into whether any other similar crashes involving Full Self-Driving have happened in low visibility conditions, and it will seek information from the company on whether any updates affected the systems performance in those conditions. In particular, this review will assess the timing, purpose and capabilities of any such updates, as well as Teslas assessment of their safety impact, the documents said. Tesla reported the four crashes to NHTSA under an order from the agency covering all automakers. An agency database says the pedestrian was killed in Rimrock, Arizona, in November of 2023 after being hit by a 2021 Tesla Model Y. Rimrock is about 100 miles (161 kilometers) north of Phoenix. The Arizona Department of Public Safety said in a statement that the crash happened just after 5 p.m. Nov. 27 on Interstate 17. Two vehicles collided on the freeway, blocking the left lane. A Toyota 4Runner stopped, and two people got out to help with traffic control. A red Tesla Model Y then hit the 4Runner and one of the people who exited from it. A 71-year-old woman from Mesa, Arizona, was pronounced dead at the scene. The collision happened because the sun was in the Tesla drivers eyes, so the Tesla driver was not charged, said Raul Garcia, public information officer for the department. Sun glare also was a contributing factor in the first collision, he added. Tesla has twice recalled Full Self-Driving under pressure from NHTSA, which in July sought information from law enforcement and the company after a Tesla using the system struck and killed a motorcyclist near Seattle. The recalls were issued because the system was programmed to run stop signs at slow speeds and because the system disobeyed other traffic laws. Both problems were to be fixed with online software updates. Critics have said that Teslas system, which uses only cameras to spot hazards, doesnt have proper sensors to be fully self driving. Nearly all other companies working on autonomous vehicles use radar and laser sensors in addition to cameras to see better in the dark or poor visibility conditions. Musk has said that humans drive with only eyesight, so cars should be able to drive with just cameras. He has called lidar (light detection and ranging), which uses lasers to detect objects, a fools errand. The Full Self-Driving recalls arrived after a three-year investigation into Teslas less-sophisticated Autopilot system crashing into emergency and other vehicles parked on highways, many with warning lights flashing. That investigation was closed last April after the agency pressured Tesla into recalling its vehicles to bolster a weak system that made sure drivers are paying attention. A few weeks after the recall, NHTSA began investigating whether the recall was working. NHTSA began its Autopilot crash investigation in 2021, after receiving 11 reports that Teslas that were using Autopilot struck parked emergency vehicles. In documents explaining why the investigation was ended, NHTSA said it ultimately found 467 crashes involving Autopilot resulting in 54 injuries and 14 deaths. Autopilot is a fancy version of cruise control, while Full Self-Driving has been billed by Musk as capable of driving without human intervention. The investigation that was opened Thursday enters new territory for NHTSA, which previously had viewed Teslas systems as assisting drivers rather than driving themselves. With the new probe, the agency is focusing on the capabilities of Full Self-Driving rather than simply making sure drivers are paying attention. Michael Brooks, executive director of the nonprofit Center for Auto Safety, said the previous investigation of Autopilot didnt look at why the Teslas werent seeing and stopping for emergency vehicles. Before they were kind of putting the onus on the driver rather than the car, he said. Here theyre saying these systems are not capable of appropriately detecting safety hazards whether the drivers are paying attention or not. Source: AP --Agencies",

Zayn, as the singer often goes by, said on the social platform X that he made the decision Given the heartbreaking loss experienced this week. He said the dates for the U.S. leg of his Stairway to the Sky tour would be rescheduled for January and he would post the new dates within the coming days. Zayn had gigs scheduled next week in San Francisco and Las Vegas, and the following week in Los Angeles, Washington D.C. and New York. Your tickets will remain valid for the new dates, Zayn wrote. Love you all and thank you for your understanding. Payne, 31, was found dead Wednesday after falling from a hotel balcony in Buenos Aires. His death prompted an outpouring of shock and sadness from friends, collaborators and fellow musicians. Paynes sister Ruth Gibbins was the latest to share her thoughts in an Instagram tribute. I dont believe this is happening. Many times have I poured my heart out publicly with pride about Liam but never much about life as his sister, she wrote. She said her brother was born with music in his veins and that what she loved most about him was his ability to make her laugh. I dont feel this world was good enough or kind enough to you, she wrote. One Direction was the internets first boy band with a level of fame comparable to Beatlemania. Band members in their teens had to cope with their sudden fame and then navigate a breakup while trying to build solo careers. The exact circumstances of Paynes death remain unclear although Argentine authorities said there were suspicious elements and drugs were possibly involved. The results of toxicology tests are expected in the coming weeks. Payne had acknowledged struggling with alcoholism, saying in a YouTube video posted in July 2023 that he had been sober for six months after receiving treatment. Source: AP --Agencies",

        "date": "October 20, 2024 10:45 am",
        "content": "The closing ceremony of the 3-month long teacher-training program in STEM subjects under Indian grant assistance for schools in the plantation regions of Sri Lanka was held recently at the Ministry of Environment, Wildlife, Forest Resources, Water Supply, Plantation and Community Infrastructure. The event was attended by the High Commissioner of India to Sri Lanka Santosh Jha, Secretary, Ministry of Education and Science and Technology Mrs. J.M. Thilaka Jayasundara and senior officials of the Ministry of Environment, Wildlife, Forest Resources, Water Supply, Plantation and Community Infrastructure and the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology and the National Institute of Education of Sri Lanka, according to a statement issued by the High Commission of India. The program, designed at the request of the Government of Sri Lanka, aimed to impart training in STEM subjects (Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics, English and Biology) to teachers in plantation schools in the country. It was organized under the multi-sectoral Indian grant assistance of INR 750 million announced last year to mark 200 years of arrival of Indian-origin Tamil community to Sri Lanka. Under the aegis of the program, 19 Indian teachers specialized in imparting training in STEM subjects arrived in Sri Lanka in July 2024. After attending a structured orientation module organized by the National Institute of Education, the teachers were deployed in schools in the plantation regions to commence the teacher-training program, the statement added. Over the course of the 10-week program conducted at nearly 40 centres spread across Central, Uva, Sabaragamuwa and Western Provinces, over 2000 Sri Lankan teachers benefitted from the training imparted by the Indian teacher-trainers. During the closing ceremony on 18th October 2024, Secretary, Ministry of Education and Science and Technology highlighted that the program was found to be significantly productive and of very high utility by the trained teachers and the schools, who called for repeating the program in the near future. She conveyed gratitude to the Government of India for the initiative. The 19 teacher-trainers from India were specially felicitated by the Government of Sri Lanka on the occasion. In his remarks, the High Commissioner of India said that the successful teacher-training program is yet another initiative that would contribute to further strengthening the unique people-to-people bonds shared by India and Sri Lanka. He underscored that the program added to the long list of development partnership initiatives of India in Sri Lanka, guided by the needs of the people of Sri Lanka and the priorities of the Government of Sri Lanka, that are bringing a positive impact in the everyday lives of the people of the country across sectors such as education, housing, health, agriculture, livelihood sustenance, hybrid renewable energy projects, ports, railways, solar electrification of religious places, among many others.",

        "date": "October 20, 2024 12:53 pm",
        "content": "An Israeli airstrike that hit several houses and a multi-storey residential building in Beit Lahiya town in northern Gaza on Saturday caused dozens of casualties, doctors and officials said, with rescue operations still underway. The Hamas media office said at least 73 people had been killed in the strike. No official casualty figures were immediately available from the health ministry however Medway Abbas, a senior health ministry official, said the figures were accurate. The Israeli military said it was looking into the incident but said the numbers issued by the Hamas media office were exaggerated. It said the figures did not align with its own information, the precise munitions used or the accuracy of the strike, which it said was directed at a Hamas target. Palestinian health officials said rescue operations were being hampered by the cut-off of telecommunication and internet services for a second day. Earlier in the day, the Gaza health ministry said Israeli military strikes killed 35 Palestinians across the enclave. This is a war of genocide and ethnic cleansing. The occupation has conducted a horrifying massacre in Beit Lahiya, the Hamas media office said. Residents and medics said Israeli forces had tightened their siege on Jabalia, the largest of the enclaves eight historic camps, which it encircled by also sending tanks to the nearby towns of Beit Hanoun and Beit Lahiya and issuing evacuation orders to residents. This is a war of genocide and ethnic cleansing. The occupation has conducted a horrifying massacre in Beit Lahiya, the Hamas media office said. Residents and medics said Israeli forces had tightened their siege on Jabalia, the largest of the enclaves eight historic camps, which it encircled by also sending tanks to the nearby towns of Beit Hanoun and Beit Lahiya and issuing evacuation orders to residents. Residents and medical officials said Israeli forces were bombing houses and besieging hospitals, preventing medical and food supplies from entering to force them to leave the camp. Health officials said they refused orders by the Israeli army to evacuate the hospital or leave the patients, many in critical condition, unattended. Hospitals in northern Gaza suffer from stark shortages of medical supplies and manpower and are overwhelmed by the number of casualties, said Hussam Abu Safiya. We are now trying to decide who among the wounded we needed to attend to first, and several wounded died because we could not deal with them, he said. SINWAR LEAFLETS Earlier on Saturday, Israeli planes dropped leaflets over southern Gaza showing a picture of the dead Hamas chief Yahya Sinwar with the message Hamas will no longer rule Gaza, echoing language used by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The move came as Israeli military strikes killed at least 108 people across the Gaza Strip on Saturday, Palestinian health officials said. Whoever drops the weapon and hands over the hostages will be allowed to leave and live in peace, read the leaflet, written in Arabic, according to residents of the southern city of Khan Younis and images circulating online. The leaflets wording was from a statement by Netanyahu on Thursday after Sinwar was killed by Israeli soldiers operating in Rafah, in the south near the Egyptian border, on Wednesday. The Oct. 7 attack Sinwar planned on Israeli communities a year ago killed around 1,200 people, with another 253 dragged back to Gaza as hostages, according to Israeli tallies. Israels subsequent war has devastated Gaza, killing more than 42,500 Palestinians, with another 10,000 uncounted dead thought to lie under the rubble, Gaza health authorities say. In the central Gaza Strip camp of Al-Maghzai, an Israeli strike on a house killed 11 people, while another strike at the nearby camp of Nuseirat killed four others. Five other people were killed in two separate strikes in the south Gaza cities of Khan Younis and Rafah, medics said, while seven Palestinians were killed in the Shati camp in the northern Gaza Strip. Later on Saturday, an Israeli strike killed three Palestinians in Nuseirat, medics said. Late on Friday, medics said 33 people, mostly women and children, were killed and 85 others were wounded in Israeli strikes that destroyed at least three houses in Jabalia. The Israeli military said it was unaware of that incident. It said forces were continuing operations against Hamas across the enclave, killing several gunmen in Rafah and Jabalia and dismantling military infrastructure. Palestinian medics said five people were killed in Jabalia on Saturday. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

We are embarking on a strategic political journey. We approach this political journey with bravery and courage, he said. He further noted that in this election, they are not contesting to become the Prime Minister, rather, they are aiming to establish a brave opposition.

        "date": "October 20, 2024 04:59 pm",
        "content": "Motoparks Yevan David won on his Euroformula debut at a damp Monza. The 17-year-old is the first ever Sri Lankan to participate in this category having advanced from F4 racing. It was close at the top in practice, with a 1m43.444s from Jose Garfias in FP2 putting him ahead 0.05 seconds ahead of champion and FP1 pacesetter Brad Benavides. BVM Racings Francesco Simonazzi trailed by 0.496s in third and David was 0.744s back in fourth. STK Melniks Roman Roubicek was 9.669s slower than Garfias in eighth and last place. The track remained dry for qualifying on Saturday morning, and there was small gaps again. Benavides set a 1m41.418s to take pole by a slim 0.125s over David. Garfias and Fernando Barrichello were 0.435s and 0.52s back respectively, and Simonazzi was 0.643s off pole in fifth as his car bounced down the straights. Roubicek cut his gap to the pack by four seconds. The track was damp for race one, and cars were equipped with wet weather tyres. David and Garfias cut turn two on lap one and rejoined the track alongside Benavides, who kept the lead until the della Roggia chicane where David drove around the outside of him. Garfias cleared Benavides exiting the chicane, as Vladislav Ryabov got into fourth ahead of Barrichello. Benavides utilised the slipstream to get on the inside of Garfias into turn one on lap two, but got baulked off track exiting turn two and dropped to sixth before reclaiming a spot on Simonazzi at della Roggia. David got loose at Lesmo 2 yet was able to extend his lead. Barrichello passed Ryabov, then chased down Garfias while David pulled away and weaved to keep his tyres warm. There was a train of cars from second to seventh place by lap seven of 16, and Simonazzi took sixth from Jakob Bergmeister on lap eight. The next lap began with Simonazzi, Benavides and Ryabov going three-wide and there was no change of position at turn one but Ryabov slowed to a stop at the exit and Simonazzi overtook Benavides for fourth. Bergmeister went around the outside of Benavides at turn one on lap 10, but Benavides was back ahead at della Roggia after cutting the chicane. On lap 11 Bergmeister picked the inside line at turn one to repeat the move, but had to give up the place a lap later following a request from race control. After doing so, he passed Benavides again at della Roggia. David had been more than five seconds clear, but Barrichello then rapidly closed in and so did the cars further behind. Simonazzi went around the outside of Garfias for third at della Roggia on lap 13, and on lap 14 the top two were side-by-side through turn one. David went off but rejoined to still lead, then Barrichello slipstreamed past starting lap 15. Roubicek was in Barrichellos path entering turn one and his avoidance of him put David back in front. At della Roggia, Barrichello then touched the rear of Davids car and spun down to fourth, leaving the debutant to win by 0.542s over Simonazzi. Source: Formula Scout --Agencies",

        "date": "October 20, 2024 09:31 pm",
        "content": "Police investigations with regard to the three bodies found inside a two-storey house which was on fire in the Sinhapura area in Chilaw, are progressing on the suspicion of a possible homicide as one of the bodies was found with her throat slit, the police spokesman said. A 42-year-old man, his 40-year-old wife and their 15-year-old daughter were found dead inside the house after the fire was extinguished. The mother was found dead on a bed inside the house while the father and daughter were found dead in the living room. Initially, it was believed that the family of three died from the fire, however, it was later revealed that the throat of the woman had been slit. The throat of the woman found dead on a bed in the house was observed to be somewhat split open and we believe that her throat was most likely slit. However, we cannot confirm anything as the body was burnt and therefore we cant be sure whether it was caused by the fire or whether it was slit, police spokesman DIG Nihal Thalduwa told reporters in Colombo. The deceased woman had been employed as a development officer at the Chilaw Divisional Secretariat and had also served as a teacher at the local Dhamma School (Sunday school). Her husband had been engaged in vehicle and property businesses while their daughter was expected to sit for the G.C.E. Ordinary Level exam next year. The police spokesman further said that it was observed that the door of the house had been locked from the inside and that flammable objects such as coconut husks and firewood which were outside the house had been brought inside the home and placed in the living room. Therefore, police suspect that a dispute which had taken place inside the house could have led to this incident, he added. Investigative officers are currently carrying out investigations on the suspicion that it was a murder, the police spokesman said. Meanwhile, Ada Derana reporter said that gold jewellery worth around Rs. 2.5 million had gone missing from their home around one month back and it had remained an unsolved mystery as no forced entry had been observed. The bodies were taken to the Chilaw District General Hospital this afternoon following the magistrates inquiry.",

        "title": "Prabowo becomes Indonesias eighth president, vows to tackle corruption",
        "date": "October 20, 2024 10:21 pm",
        "content": "Indonesias Prabowo Subianto on Sunday took over as president of the worlds third-largest democracy, vowing to combat internal issues such as corruption that plague the country and to make it more self-sufficient. The 73-year-old has undergone a remarkable transformation, from being a former military commander facing unproven allegations of rights abuses to sweeping the polls and now leading the country of 280 million people. Wearing a traditional black hat and navy suit with a woven maroon and golden sarong, Prabowo officially became Indonesias eighth president on Sunday morning after he was sworn in during a ceremony at Indonesias parliament. Prabowo, who unsuccessfully ran for the presidency twice before, said in a fiery speech to lawmakers he would be president for all Indonesians and challenged the nation to help him face down the countrys problems. We must always realise that a free nation is where the people are free, Prabowo said, at times raising his voice. They must be freed of fear, poverty, hunger, ignorance, oppression, suffering, he said. In a wide-ranging speech lasting about an hour, Prabowo said self-sufficiency for food was possible within five years, while also pledging to become self-sufficient in energy. The new president vowed to eradicate corruption and said that while he wanted to live in a democracy, it must be polite. A difference of opinion must come without enmity ... fighting without hating, he said. Prabowo won the Feb. 14 contest with nearly 60 of the vote and has spent the past nine months building a formidable parliamentary coalition. He was joined in the swearing-in ceremony by his running mate, Gibran Rakabuming Raka, 37, the eldest son of outgoing President Joko Jokowi Widodo. Later on Sunday, Prabowo announced his cabinet at the presidential palace. While it had of a mix of professional and political appointees, most of the economics-related ministers remained the same as those under Jokowi. One key announcement was for the foreign ministry, which will now be led by Sugiono, a former member of the armys special forces. The cabinet will be sworn in on Monday morning. GREETING SUPPORTERS After his speech, Prabowo wore a baseball cap and waved through a car sunroof as he made his way to the presidential palace, passing thousands of flag-waving supporters thronging Jakartas streets in a festival-like atmosphere. Flower boards outside the palace either congratulated Prabowo and Gibran or thanked Jokowi for his decade of service. Jokowi supporters are also attending the celebrations to bid farewell to Indonesias outgoing leader. Anneta Yuniar, a bystander who had excitedly waved at Jokowis motorcade as it slowly made its way past supporters before the ceremony, said she would miss Jokowi but that Prabowo was a strong leader. Prabowo will continue the development that Jokowi started. Theres continuity. Its what I want, she said. Jokowi has left an indelible mark on the nation of 280 million, presiding over a period of strong economic growth and massive infrastructure development. Critics also say, though, his rule has been marked by a rise in old-time patronage and dynastic politics, and they warn about diminished integrity in courts and other state institutions. Indonesian police and military have put in place strict security measures, deploying at least 100,000 personnel across the city, including snipers and anti-riot units. Prabowo met with foreign dignitaries, including a number of heads of state, on Sunday at the presidential palace. China sent Vice President Han Zheng to the inauguration, while the delegation from the United States is being led by U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Linda Thomas-Greenfield. Prabowo also touched on foreign policy during his speech, saying Indonesia was non-aligned on the global stage, but that he stood in support of the Palestinian people and said Jakarta was ready to send more aid to Gaza. During his campaign, Prabowo billed himself to voters and investors alike as the continuity candidate. Past allegations against Prabowo of involvement in the kidnapping of student activists and human rights abuses in Papua and East Timor, however, have also raised concern about Indonesias trajectory of democracy, human rights advocates say. Prabowo has always denied the allegations that led to his dismissal from the military in 1998, the same year Indonesia broke free from the decades-long authoritarian rule of former President Suharto.

        "title": "New President Subianto announces Indonesias largest-ever Cabinet, with 109 members",
        "date": "October 21, 2024 08:08 am",
        "content": "Newly inaugurated President Prabowo Subianto announced Indonesias largest-ever Cabinet late Sunday, with 109 members representing his pledge for a strong government. He named his Cabinet of ministers, vice ministers and head of national agencies the Red and White Cabinet, referring to the colors of Indonesias flag. Subianto became the eighth president of Southeast Asias largest economy on Sunday. The Cabinet of Subiantos predecessor, Joko Widodo, had 34 ministers and head of government agencies. Subianto has said earlier that he needs a strong administration, even though analysts said that his fat Cabinet would bloat the bureaucracy. I want to create a strong government that would unite our multicultural society and diverse political interests, Subianto said before inviting more than 100 people for interviews at his residence last week. It must be a big coalition, and some will say my Cabinet is fat. The Cabinet features politicians from a coalition of seven parties who supported his victory in the February election, and figures allied with Widodos Cabinet, who were reappointed to continue their jobs under Subiantos presidency. Analysts said the move was a political reward to Widodo for the latters tacit support in the election. Subianto was sworn in with his new vice president, 37-year-old Surakarta ex-Mayor Gibran Rakabuming Raka. He chose Raka, who is Widodos son, as his running mate, with Widodo favoring Subianto over the candidate of his own former party. The former rivals became tacit allies, even though Indonesian presidents dont typically endorse candidates. Subianto was a longtime rival of the Widodo, who ran against him for the presidency twice and refused to accept his defeat on both occasions, in 2014 and 2019. But Widodo appointed Subianto as defense chief after his reelection, paving the way for an alliance despite their rival political parties. During the campaign, Subianto ran as the popular outgoing presidents heir, vowing to continue signature policies like the construction of a multibillion-dollar new capital city and limits on exporting raw materials intended to boost domestic industry. Backed by Widodo, Subianto swept to a landslide victory in Februarys direct presidential election on promises of policy continuity. Subianto reappointed nearly half of Widodos Cabinet members, including Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati, making her the first person to hold the ministry under three different presidents. Indrawati, 62, who has served as the executive director of the International Monetary Fund and managing director of the World Bank, is one of Indonesias longest-serving finance ministers, having held the post for long stretches under Presidents Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono and Joko Widodo. She has earned considerable respect in international circles, particularly for her reforms of the chaotic Indonesian taxation system and her role in steering Indonesia through the global financial crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic. We regularly consulted with each other to discuss strategies for strengthening the Finance Ministry and the state finances to support his programs, Indrawati told reporters after meeting with Subianto last week. Other ministers from Widodos Cabinet include Interior Minister Tito Karnavian, Trade Minister Zulkifli Hasan, Energy Minister Bahlil Lahadalia and State-Owned Enterprises Minister Erick Thohir. Subianto has announced an ambitious goal of increasing annual economic growth to 8 by the end of his five-year term, and embarking on an ambitious spending program, including an increase in defense spending, hikes in civil servants salaries, and a program to give 83 million children free meals.

        "content": "At least six migrant workers and a doctor were shot dead in Indias Kashmir region on Sunday night when militants opened fire near a tunnel construction site, officials said, days after a new government was formed in the territory. An opposition alliance took power in the region this month after winning its first polls in a decade, and the first since its special status was revoked and it was split into two federally administered territories - Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh. The victims of Sundays attack were involved in the construction of tunnels meant to provide all-weather connectivity to the militarily strategic Ladakh region, which shares a border with China and Pakistan. At least two armed militants barged into the mess of the private construction company and fired at workers who were dining at the time of the attack, said a senior police officer who did not want to be named. Six workers and a doctor were killed and five others were injured in the attack, he said. Non-Kashmiri migrant workers employed in orchards, paddy fields and construction sites in Kashmir have previously also been targeted by militant groups aiming to drive them away. Indias Interior Minister Amit Shah termed the attack a despicable act of cowardice. Those involved in this heinous act will not be spared and will face the harshest response from our security forces, he said in a post on X. Kashmir is claimed in full but ruled in part by both India and Pakistan, and militants in the portion under Indias control have for decades fought security forces, resulting in the deaths of thousands of people. In another incident of violence last week, a bullet-riddled body of a labourer from the eastern state of Bihar had been recovered from Kashmirs Shopian region. At least nine soldiers were killed in two separate attacks by suspected militants in July, barely a month after Prime Minister Narendra Modi took charge for a third consecutive term.

        "content": "Leader of the Sarvajana Balaya alliance and Gampaha District candidate, entrepreneur Dilith Jayaweera stated that the public should entrust the responsibility of forming a strong opposition to the Sarvajana Balaya alliance after the upcoming parliamentary elections. He made these remarks during a public meeting held yesterday (20) in Panadura. Now our President Anura Kumara is in a lot of trouble because he became President without an economic plan. He stated that someone else had the plan, but they are not giving him the book, and that a few pages are missing from it. Now, the President needs to call and ask what to do next. We are not like that, he said. We propose to Anura Kumara that we are coming to the opposition, and you will form your government. We will help you with any good work. He has already said that the salary of government employees will be increased every six months. We will help with that. He also promised petrol at Rs. 200, and we will support that too, the Sarvajana Balaya leader added. Jayaweera mentioned that they had advised Anura Kumara not to make statements about stolen funds hidden in Uganda, as it could be perceived as a joke. He added that while there may be no funds hidden in Uganda, his alliance is aware of the funds that were taken out of Sri Lanka. He further explained, Our program outlines how to bring it back, what legal measures are necessary, and how commissions should be established. Its all in our plan. Jayaweera expressed that Anura Kumara has the ability to take necessary measures to recover the lost wealth. He further stated that there is no reason to appoint Sajith Premadasa as the leader of the opposition again. Therefore, its up to the people to decide that we dont need him as the leader of the opposition, he said.",

        "date": "October 21, 2024 04:16 pm",
        "content": "King Charles was accused of genocide by an Indigenous senator at Australias Parliament House on Monday, moments after he delivered a speech in which he paid his respects to the traditional owners of the lands. Charles, on his 16th official visit to Australia and his first major foreign trip since being diagnosed with cancer, had finished speaking when independent senator and Indigenous activist Lidia Thorpe shouted that she did not accept Charles sovereignty over Australia. You committed genocide against our people, she said. Give us our land back. Give us what you stole from us - our bones, our skulls, our babies, our people. You destroyed our land. Give us a treaty. We want treaty. Thorpe, who has disrupted previous events protesting over the colonisation of Australia, was stopped from approaching the king, who spoke quietly to Prime Minister Anthony Albanese on the podium but was otherwise unfazed. Thorpe was then escorted out of the chamber. Thorpe has said the incarceration and violence caused by colonisation can only end with a national treaty between the government and Indigenous people to address First Nations issues. Former Prime Minister Tony Abbott from the conservative Liberal Party, who attended the event, told reporters it was an unfortunate political exhibitionism. A palace source said the king and queen were grateful to the many thousands of people who had turned out, adding they are only sorry they didnt have a chance to stop and talk to every single one. The warmth and scale of the reception was truly awesome. The protest was an outlier among a stream of tributes to Charles and Queen Camilla from dignitaries and well-wishers in the crowds, with Albanese speaking about the respect Australians had for their monarch and praising Charles for his long advocacy on climate change. His speech made only a passing reference to the republican cause, which Albanese and much of his centre-left Labor party support. The Australia you first knew has grown and evolved in so many ways, he said. Yet through these decades of change, our bonds of respect and affection have matured - and endured. Albanese shelved plans for a referendum on turning Australia into a republic after a government-backed referendum to create an Indigenous advisory body was defeated earlier this year. The visit to parliament followed a trip to the Australian War Memorial in Canberra where the royal couple met more than a thousand well-wishers including Hephner, a nine-year old alpaca in a suit with a crown perched atop his fluffy white head. Hephner, named after Playboy founder Hugh Hefner, waited for hours alongside owner Robert Fletcher and long lines of others outside the memorial for the chance to greet the royal couple on their one-day tour of the capital. He has many outfits and this is one weve saved specifically for today, said Fletcher. One king meets another king. Hephners patience paid off. On a 30-minute walk to greet the crowds, Charles stopped to pat the alpaca, pulling back with a laugh when Hephner snorted in his face. The royal couple continue their visit to Australia in Sydney on Tuesday, before heading to Samoa for a meeting of countries in the British Commonwealth. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "date": "October 21, 2024 05:26 pm",
        "content": "Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) leader and former MP Udaya Gammanpila says that former Senior DIG Ravi Seneviratne, who has been named as a main accused in an investigative committee reports on the Easter Sunday attacks, should be immediately removed from the post of Secretary to the Ministry of Public Security. He made these comments at a press conference held in Colombo this morning (21), for the alleged publicizing of two previously unreleased reports regarding the Easter Sunday terror attacks. Gammanpila had yesterday stated that he would give President Anura Kumara Dissanayake time until 10.00 a.m. this morning (21) to make public the two investigative reports in question and vowed to release them himself if the President fails to do so. Accordingly, speaking at a press conference today after the said deadline had ended, he emphasized that one of the two reports will be publicized today whereas the remaining report will be released to the public next Monday. He stated that the report of the Committee of Inquiry, chaired by retired High Court Judge A.N.J. De Alwis, appointed to investigate the actions taken by the State Intelligence Service (SIS), Chief of National Intelligence (CNI), and other relevant authorities concerning prior intelligence received about the bomb attacks on 21 April 2019, would be released by him today. Meanwhile, the second report of the committee led by retired Supreme Court Justice S.I. Imam, which investigated the claims made in the Channel 4 documentary that alleged collusion between the Sri Lankan intelligence services and the terror suspects involved in the Easter Sunday bombings, would be released on October 28, he said. Gammanpila further accused the President of intentionally violating the constitution and therefore, insisted that the President owes an immediate apology to the nation for concealing information regarding the two reports. He criticized the incumbent President for not making public the two reports of the investigative committees appointed by former President Ranil Wickremesinghe, suggesting that the delay was intentional. Gammanpila said that a committee chaired by retired Supreme Court Justice S. I. Imam had handed over its report to the former president on June 25, 2024. The second investigation report conducted under a committee chaired by retired Justice A.N.J. de Alwis, which examined potential failures by the Police and State Intelligence Services regarding the Easter Sunday attacks, was handed over to then President Wickremesinghe on September 14, 2024, exactly one week before the appointment of the current President. Gammanpila questioned why the current government was concealing these reports, and also highlighted a particular detail from the 43rd page of one report, which he claims indicated that the then Director of the State Intelligence Service (SIS) had warned the Senior DIG of the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) stating that a foreign intelligence agency had warned about an impending series of suicide attacks planned in churches and other places by terrorists affiliated with the National Thowheeth Jamaath (NTJ), including its leader Mohamed Zahran, on April 9, 2019. Gammanpila pointed out that the Senior DIG mentioned in the report is none other than the current Secretary to the Ministry of Public Security, Ravi Seneviratne. The document mentions the names, national identity card numbers, telephone numbers, addresses, the places frequented by them, people they associate with, even the places where they go at night and the times they come and go, said the former MP. He stated that given the serious allegations levelled against Ravi Senaviratne in the commission report, he has completely reviewed the Fundamental Rights (FR) petition filed by the former DIG seeking to prevent his arrest. The PHU leader further alleged that on page 41 of this report it is recommended that Ravi Seneviratne should be prosecuted and punished for criminal negligence. If that is the case, Ravi Seneviratne should be one of the main accused in the Easter attacks. Under his supervision, if the investigation into the Easter attack is being reopened, can justice truly be served for the Easter attack victims? Can we have any hope of justice from the police in such a situation? This is like asking for clues from the thief himself instead of asking the thiefs mother, he said. Gammanpila indicated that concerns were raised regarding the appointment of Ravi Seneviratne as Secretary of the Ministry of Public Security before the report was received. He also noted that the Alwis report, specifically on page 14, recommends filing criminal charges against former Senior DIG Ravi Seneviratne and former CID Director Shani Abeysekera for their failure to adequately perform their duties. Additionally, there are 17 officials named in this report who should face prosecution. Why did the President and this government try to suppress this report? The reason is that the Presidents incompetence has been exposed. If we do not disclose these reports now, the President will be able to protect these individuals from prosecution, he added. Gammanpila questioned the decision to appoint Ravi Seneviratne as Secretary of the Ministry of Public Security, despite his implication in the Easter attack, and criticized the choice to let him oversee the investigation into that attack. He further said, We have reasonable suspicion that this appointment was made with the ulterior motive of misleading the entire nation by distorting the truth about the Easter attack, in order to protect Mohamed Ibrahim, who was on the JVP national list and whom even then Director of the CID Shani Abeysekera believed was involved in the attack. In light of this context, the committee has called for prosecution, he said while asserting that Ravi Seneviratne, now a suspect in a significant police investigation, should be promptly removed from his position. He emphasized that justice for the Easter victims cannot be anticipated while Seneviratne remains in office. The President must immediately apologize to the nation for this abuse of power and the willful violation of the Constitution within the first month of assuming office. If the President does not take these two actions removing Ravi Seneviratne from his position immediately and stopping the deliberate suppression of information from the public, we will bring forward an impeachment against the President in the next Parliament, he said.",

        "content": "The post-mortem examinations have been conducted today (21) with regard to the three bodies found inside a two-storey house which was on fire in the Sinhapura area in Chilaw yesterday. Accordingly, the autopsies have revealed that the deceased woman and her daughter had been murdered by slitting their throats before their bodies were set on fire. The Chilaw District General Hospitals Judicial Medical Officer (JMO) carried out the post-mortem examination on the bodies of the woman and her daughter this afternoon at the hospitals mortuary. The deceased are identified as Shaminidulage Gedara Senaratne (51), his wife Muhandiramlage Manjula Niroshani Bandara (44) and their 15-year-old daughter, Shaminidulage Gedara Nethmi Nimesha. It has been revealed that Senarathne was involved in the business of selling land plots, while his wife Manjula Niroshani was employed as the Economic Development Officer in charge of the the Munneswaram Division at the Chilaw Divisional Secretariat. The post-mortem examination of the wife, Manjula Niroshani, has been conducted first, and it has been revealed that her neck area had been attacked with a sharp weapon 6 times. The JMO is of the opinion that she most likely died on the night of October 18. He believes that the death occurred due to excessive bleeding and the body was set on fire the following day. The Judicial Medical Officer has also observed that there were two cut wounds on the neck of the daughter, Nethmi Nimesha and that she had been murdered on the night of October 19. Meanwhile, the forensic officer conducting the post-mortem exam on the husband has issued an open verdict regarding his death. Police investigations have uncovered that the deceased husband was engaged in the business of selling plots of land, but he had borrowed money from many people. As a result of this, he had asked his wife for the 05-acre land belonging to her located in the Kokkawila area on the Chilaw-Kurunegala road, in order to divide it into land plots and sell it, police have uncovered. However, the wife has not agreed to the request. Meanwhile, gold jewellery worth around Rs. 2.5 million had gone missing from their home around 02 months ago and it has been revealed during the police investigation that no outsider has entered the house. It has also been revealed that the jewellery had been kept in the house without any protection. Police also said that due to these two incidents, there were frequent quarrels and arguments between the husband and wife. However, as they have not maintained any relationship with their neighbours, the police have not been able to find many details about what had actually happened in the house. Police suspect that the husband, who killed his wife and daughter, may have set their bodies on fire and then took his own life.",

The relevant petition has been filed by the civil society activist and convenor of the Api Sri Lanka national organization H.M Priyantha Herath. The Attorney General, the Secretary to the President, the Chairman of the Election Commission and its members have been named as respondents in the petition. The petitioner has claimed that as per Section 10 of the Parliamentary Elections Act, the period for accepting nominations was declared from October 4 to October 11. The petition further points out that according to the Parliamentary Elections Act, the date for polling should be scheduled not less than five weeks and not more than seven weeks from the date of closing of nominations. Accordingly, the petition has stated that once the nomination period concluded on October 11, the five-week period would conclude on November 15, and the seven-week period would be completed on November 29. However, the petitioner has emphasized that holding the General Election on November 14 is not included in the legal period and that therefore holding parliamentary polls on that day is unlawful. The petition has also indicated that attempts were made to notify the Chairman of the Election Commission related to this offense, but no action was taken. The petitioner has requested the Supreme Court to issue an order stating that the peoples sovereignty and the Constitution are violated by this decision.

The helicopter went down just before 8 p.m. Sunday in a neighborhood east of downtown after taking off from Ellington Field, about 15 miles (24 kilometers) away, Mayor John Whitmire said at a news conference. He didnt know the flights destination. Officials said no one on the ground was injured, and no nearby homes were damaged, though some vehicles were. The crash sparked a fire that burned about 100 to 200 yards (91 to 183 meters) of grass, officials said. Firefighters at a nearby station heard the crash and responded, Whitmire said. He said it was a terrible accident scene and that the tower and helicopter were destroyed. Some area residents lost power, Whitmire said. It is surrounded by residences and thats where we were very fortunate  that it didnt topple in one direction or another, Whitmire said. And the fireball pretty much was isolated. The National Transportation Safety Board said in a statement that it is investigating the crash of the Robinson R44 II helicopter, which preliminary information shows was operating as an air tour flight. The NTSB said the helicopter crashed into a radio tower under unknown circumstances, resulting in a fire. Officials said the four people aboard the helicopter included a child but the identities of the victims and their ages have not yet been released. Police and fire officials have urged residents near the crash site to call 911 if they find anything on their property that could help in their investigation. Police officers on Monday were scouring an area of around 4 acres (1.6 hectares) for debris from the crash, said Lt. Jonathan French. NTSB investigators, who arrived on site Monday, started collecting evidence and will return Tuesday to continue that work, said Brian Rutt, an air safety investigator for the agency. The Federal Aviation Administration is also investigating. Source: AP --Agencies",

        "title": "Govt rejects Easter attacks report released by Gammanpila, assures fresh probe",
        "date": "October 22, 2024 11:34 am",
        "content": "The government does not accept the investigative committee report on the Easter Sunday bomb attacks, which was released by former MP Udaya Gammanpila yesterday (21), Cabinet Spokesman Minister Vijitha Herath said. However, he stated that the government will conduct a new investigation into the incidents. He revealed this stance while speaking during the Cabinet press briefing in Colombo today (22). Divulging the contents of a previously unreleased investigative committee report on the Easter Sunday attacks during a press conference yesterday (21), Gammanpila had claimed that former Senior DIG Ravi Seneviratne has been named as an accused in the report and called for his immediate removal from the post of Secretary to the Ministry of Public Security. He had also alleged that the report recommends filing criminal charges against former Senior DIG Ravi Seneviratne and former CID Director Shani Abeysekera for their failure to adequately perform their duties. Responding to questions from reporters regarding these accusations and the said report, Cabinet Spokesman Minister Vijitha Herath emphasized that the investigations into the Easter Sunday attacks were conducted impartially by the team of CID officers including Ravi Seneviratne and Shani Abeysekera. He claimed that when Gotabaya Rajapaksa took office as the President, there was an immediate effort to remove Shani Abeysekera who was subjected to a witch hunt, and that political interference had previously obstructed investigations. We dont interfere like that. We are allowing investigations to proceed, he assured. Highlighting that many other individuals are mentioned in the investigative report referred to by Gammanpila, Minister Herath stated that the former MP is not questioning those names and is solely focusing on discrediting Seneviratne and Abeysekera in order to have them removed from their positions. We will not surrender to those needs. The clear target of this committee report is none other than Ravi Seneviratne and Shani Abeysekera, he charged. Herath referenced a previous Supreme Court case concerning the violation of fundamental rights of the Easter attack victims, pointing out that while Ravi Seneviratnes name was mentioned, he was not found guilty of any charges by a panel of seven judges, and neither was Shani Abeysekeras name included in the case. Herath suggested that the committees report aimed specifically at Seneviratne and Abeysekera, noting that other individuals, such as former IGP Deshbandu Tennakoon, were also mentioned but received no attention from Gammanpila. He criticized Gammanpila for not addressing these individuals, implying that the timing of the report, shortly after the election campaigns, was a reflection of personal motives rather than a genuine effort for accountability. He cannot see those other names. Now after sleeping for so long he has woken up. He held ministerial posts in the government. He was in the opposition. He never spokes about this then. It is now clear whose wishes are being fulfilled as the report was handed over exactly when the election campaigning ended. This is just committee report,  he said. Explaining further about these allegations, Cabinet Spokesman Vijitha Herath said that the committee was established based on political interests. Therefore, he said, the government will not accept the committee reports. He said that Ravi Seneviratne has not been found guilty anywhere in the Janaka de silva commission report. He further said that as a government, they do not accept this committee, which he claimed was formed by then President Ranil Wickremesinghe with the aim of political revenge, by appointing a former high court judge who was accused of misconduct and had retired. The government expressed its intention to conduct a new investigation that would consider all relevant facts from these reports, emphasizing a commitment to justice for the victims of perceived injustice.",
