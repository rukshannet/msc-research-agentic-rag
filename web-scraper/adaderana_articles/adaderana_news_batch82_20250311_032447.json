        "title": "IMF commends Sri Lankas efforts in completing first review",
        "date": "January 12, 2024 05:12 pm",
        "content": "During a meeting between President Ranil Wickremesinghe, Sri Lankan authorities and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) yesterday (11 Jan.), the IMF congratulated the country on completing the first review under its program. The IMF highlighted the positive start of the program, recognizing the challenging reforms undertaken by Sri Lanka and their significant impact on the domestic population. Directors at the executive board meeting applauded Sri Lankas courage in publishing the governance diagnostic, a pioneering effort in Asia. Senior Mission Chief for Sri Lanka, Peter Breuer noted that encouraging signs were noted regarding the programs impact on stabilizing the economy, particularly in policy-oriented variables and fiscal areas. A recent meeting revealed promising revenue collection, indicating the effectiveness of implemented policies since reaching a staff level agreement in the second half of 2022. The IMF emphasized the positive surprise in these developments, boosting confidence with the international community, official creditors and private creditors. Mr. Peter Breuer told President Wickremesinghe, With respect to revenue collection, in fact, we had a meeting that showed very encouraging numbers that basically highlight that the policies you implemented beginning from after we reached the staff level agreement in the second half of 2022 are working, that they have the intended effect, that youre collecting the revenue thats needed to address the cause of the crisis. So, that really is very good news. The board meeting recognized Sri Lankas success in reducing inflation significantly, attributing it to the governments efforts in monetary policy and scaling back monetary financing. Positive outcomes, such as an increase in reserves, were also observed. The ongoing governance reforms were acknowledged as positive indicators, contributing to tentative economic growth in the third quarter, particularly in capital formation and machinery. As the IMF plans its upcoming formal review and Article 4 consultation, key areas of focus include the new public financial management law, potential conflicts with the public-private partnership law, electricity tariffs and urgent preparations for property taxation. The IMF stressed the importance of perseverance with ongoing reforms, addressing fiscal issues and advancing governance agendas. The meeting also highlighted the urgency of addressing fiscal matters, including passing amendments to the Banking Act and recapitalizing the banking sector. On the governance front, operationalizing the Anti-Corruption Commission, publishing action plans and meeting with the Constitutional Council for insights into commissioner selection processes were discussed. The IMF commended Sri Lankas partnership on capacity development, emphasizing the importance of enhancing the skills of the civil service for the success of ongoing reforms. The program aims to build capacity in the civil service, crucial for the implementation of reforms. The authorities expressed approval for the program and discussions on its rollout and impact will continue in the coming weeks. As the two-week mission unfolds, further discussions between Sri Lankan authorities and the IMF are expected to delve deeper into these key areas, providing a comprehensive overview of the progress and challenges in Sri Lankas economic reform journey.",

        "title": "Oil jumps 4 as tankers avoid Red Sea after strikes",
        "date": "January 12, 2024 05:44 pm",
        "content": "Oil prices leaped 4 on Friday, as oil tankers diverted course from the Red Sea following overnight air and sea strikes by the United States and Britain on Houthi targets in Yemen after attacks on shipping by the Iran-backed group. Witnesses in Yemen confirmed explosions throughout the country. Brent crude futures were up 3.16, or 4.1, at 80.57 a barrel at 1124 GMT, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures climbed 3.05, or 4.2, to 75.07. Both benchmarks were on course for a second straight weekly rise. The U.S. and UK strikes added to market concerns about the Israel-Hamas war widening into a broader conflict in the Middle East affecting oil supplies from the region, especially those moving through the critical Strait of Hormuz. If a large part of Strait of Hormuz flows were to be halted, it would present up to three times the impact of the 1970s oil price shocks and over double the impact of the Ukraine war on gas markets, atop already fragile supply chains and stock levels, said Saul Kavonic, an energy analyst at MST Marquee. ING analysts in a note said more than 20 million barrelsday of oil move through the Strait of Hormuz, equivalent to around 20 of global consumption. U.S. President Joe Biden said the targeted strikes in Yemen were a clear message that the United States and its partners will not tolerate attacks on its personnel or allow hostile actors to imperil freedom of navigation. A Houthis spokesperson said the group would continue to target shipping heading towards Israel. Saudi Arabia, a top oil exporter and regional power, called for restraint and avoiding escalation and said it was monitoring the situation with great concern. Attacks by the Houthis in the Red Sea have disrupted international commerce on a route between Europe and Asia which accounts for about 15 of the worlds shipping traffic. The Houthis have attacked commercial vessels in the Red Sea to show support for Palestinian militant group Hamas in its fight against Israel. Shipping giant Maersk (MAERSKb.CO) and others are diverting vessels away from the Red Sea, warning customers of further disruptions. The U.S.-led attacks follow Irans seizure on Thursday of a tanker carrying Iraqi crude destined for Turkey south of the Strait of Hormuz. Source - Reuters - Agencies",

        "title": "Taiwan votes for a new president against a backdrop of growing China threats",
        "date": "January 13, 2024 11:15 am",
        "content": "Taiwan began voting Saturday in a closely watched election that could reverberate far beyond its shores after years of growing threats from Beijing, which warned this week the islands future is at a crossroads. The self-governing island of 24 million people will choose both a new president and parliament at a time of heightened tension with China, which under leader Xi Jinping has become much more powerful  and increasingly belligerent toward Taiwan. Polls opened on Saturday morning and will close at 4pm (3am Eastern Time). The result is expected later that evening under Taiwans famously efficient and transparent counting process. The boisterous election campaign, itself an illustration of Taiwans vibrant democratic credentials, has been fought over a mixture of livelihood issues as well as the thorny question of how to deal with its authoritarian neighbor to the northwest. Chinas ruling Communist Party claims Taiwan as its territory, despite having never controlled it. And Xi has called Taiwans unification with the mainland a historical inevitability. The results will not only decide Taiwans future, but could also reshape its relations with Beijing and pose a test to the latest efforts by the United States and China to stabilize rocky ties. Beijing, which routinely sends fighter jets and warships close to Taiwans skies and waters, has framed the vote as a choice between peace and war, prosperity and decline. On Wednesday, it warned Taiwans voters to make the right choice at the crossroads of cross-strait relations while railing against the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which has won Taiwans last two presidential elections. In the final days leading up to the vote, candidates toured major cities around the island to stage nightly campaign rallies, featuring rock music, emotional speeches and the rhythmic chanting of slogans by large crowds. Three men with different visions Three men are vying to succeed President Tsai Ing-wen, the islands first female leader. Over the last eight years, Tsai has raised Taiwans global profile, strengthened its ties with democratic powers and pursued progressive policies at home, including making Taiwan the first place in Asia to legalize same-sex marriage  though her party has also come under criticism over economic issues. Relations with China nosedived after Beijing cut off most communications with Taipei in response to her 2016 election win, and further stepped up economic and military pressure following her landslide re-election four years later. Tsais current vice president, Lai Ching-te, is hoping to win a third term for the ruling DPP, which champions Taiwans de-facto sovereignty and separate identity from China. That would be unprecedented in the islands nearly three decades of democratic history and represent a further rejection by Taiwanese voters of Beijings strongarm tactics. Hou Yu-ih, a mayor and former police chief, is the candidate for the main opposition party Kuomintang (KMT), which traditionally favors closer cross-strait ties. A victory for the KMT would be welcome to Beijing and signal that voters might want to deescalate tensions. The third contender, Ko Wen-je, hails from the Taiwan Peoples Party (TPP), which he founded in 2019 to challenge the islands political duopoly. Ko also favors closer ties with China but says he will be less deferential to Beijing than the KMT. The race is tight. Final polls before the 10-day blackout period showed Lai had a slight edge over Hou, followed by Ko. Beijing, which openly loathes the DPP and Lai and favors a win by the KMTs Hou, has stepped up pressure on Taiwan ahead of the vote. It slapped sanctions on Taiwanese exports, flew spy balloons over the island, and showed off a new aircraft carrier, the Fujian, named after the mainland province closest to Taiwan. Taipei has also accused Beijing of ramping up disinformation campaigns and magnifying talking points favorable to China-friendly candidates as part of its election interference. China has long used a mixture of carrot and stick to woo Taiwan but over the last eight years it has mostly been stick. That increasingly bellicose stance  and the countrys authoritarian turn under Xi  has pushed Taiwans public further away: Less than 10 now support an immediate or eventual unification, and less than 3 identify primarily as Chinese. A 33-year-old writer, who only gave his surname Tsang, said he cared the most about cross-strait relations and Taiwans democratic values. Taiwan is a different country from China, and we need to let the international world know that we are different, he told CNN at a DPP rally on Thursday. But relations with China is not the only thing on Taiwan voters minds. Despite the growing threats from Beijing, some people, especially younger voters, say China is not their biggest concern in this election  because they dont think the status quo will change in the short term anyway, despite Xis rhetoric. Instead, they care more about the economy and livelihood issues, from Taiwans notoriously stagnant wages to its unaffordable homes. Analysts say that is an area where the TPP  which advertises itself as a pragmatic middle-way party  has attracted young voters. The leaders often say that our economy has improved. But we really dont feel that on a local level, a transport sector worker and father of two children surnamed Wu said at a TPP rally Thursday. What we see is that housing prices and cost of living have been going up, so people have to be really careful about how they spend their money, he added. The whole island has been on the move since Friday  Taiwan doesnt allow absentee ballots, meaning voters must travel to their home counties to cast their ballots. Almost all high-speed train tickets leaving Taipei for the southern part of the island during daytime Friday and Saturday have been sold out days in advance. Some voters have also traveled back from overseas. Dan Chang, 36, who works in finance in Hong Kong, flew to back to Taipei on Friday. For him, the most important issue is Taiwans sovereignty  he never trusted China, and Beijings crackdown on Hong Kong has only strengthened his belief, he said. If Taiwan didnt have China as a neighbor today, I might not be so motivated to go back and vote, he said. Source: CNN --Agencies",

        "date": "January 13, 2024 12:28 pm",
        "content": "The Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) says it has submitted the necessary data supporting the proposal seeking electricity tariffs revision to the Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL). In the proposal handed over to the PUCSL, the state-owned electricity supplier said it has analyzed all possible scenarios to approach the best estimate of expenditure and revenue based on a number of factors such as existing tariffs, availability of coaloil fuel stocks, future fuel prices, hydro inflow variations, scheduled plant outages, envisioned economic crisis resulting in the reduction of energy demand and sales, adjusted expenses of transmission and distribution, various policy instructions of government to derive the Bulk Supply Tariff (BST) and end-user tariff proposal. Based on CEBs analysis, a surplus of Rs. 23,730.9 million is estimated. The CEB says the surplus can be used for the reduction of average tariff by 3.34. The new tariff proposal has been prepared considering a relief to low-income vulnerable groups and the entities of economically important businesses based on policy instructions of MOPE (Ministry of Power  Energy). Accordingly, a surplus has been allocated to all the consumer categories , the CEB said. Electricity tariffs in the domestic category for consumers using less than 30 units is thus proposed to be reduced by Rs. 1, to Rs. 11 per unit. Meanwhile, the fixed charge for the first 30 units consumed is proposed to be reduced to Rs. 165 from Rs. 180. Furthermore, the tariff charged per unit for the units consumed between 31-60, which currently stands at Rs. 30, is proposed to be reduced to Rs. 27. The fixed charge for this category is suggested to be brought down to Rs. 360 from Rs. 330. On Friday (Jan.12), CEBs media spokesperson Eng. Noel Priyantha said the state-owned electricity supplier would hand over the proposal for electricity tariffs reduction to the PUCSL during the course of the day. We are working on providing maximum possible relief to the public by way of electricity tariffs, he said emphasizing that low-income people would definitely receive these benefits. The CEB spokesperson further mentioned that a tariff reduction is possible as Sri Lanka has received substantial rainfall over the past few months, especially in the months of November and December. On January 05, State Minister of Power  Energy Indika Anuruddha told a press conference that data supporting the electricity tariffs revision had already been submitted to the PUCSL and that the rates were likely to be slashed by the first week of February. However, the PUCSL was at odds with the statement and denied receiving a document from the CEB on the proposed electricity tariffs reduction. The energy sector regulator clarified that there was no truth to the media reports in this regard. CEB Electricity Tariff Revision Proposal by Adaderana Online on Scribd",

        "title": "US military strikes another Houthi-controlled site after warning ships to avoid parts of Red Sea",
        "date": "January 13, 2024 12:41 pm",
        "content": "The U.S. military early Saturday struck another Houthi-controlled site in Yemen that it had determined was putting commercial vessels in the Red Sea at risk, a day after the U.S. and Britain launched multiple airstrikes targeting Houthi rebels. Associated Press journalists in Sanaa, Yemens capital, heard one loud explosion. U.S. Central Command said the follow-on action early Saturday local time against a Houthi radar site was conducted by the Navy destroyer USS Carney using Tomahawk land attack missiles. The first day of strikes Friday hit 28 locations and struck more than 60 targets. President Joe Biden had warned Friday that the Houthis could face further strikes. The latest strike came after the U.S. Navy on Friday warned American-flagged vessels to steer clear of areas around Yemen in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden for the next 72 hours after the initial airstrikes. The warning came as Yemens Houthis vowed fierce retaliation, further raising the prospect of a wider conflict in a region already beset by Israels war in Gaza. U.S. military and White House officials said they expected the Houthis to try to strike back. The U.S.-led bombardment  launched in response to a recent campaign of drone and missile attacks on commercial ships in the vital Red Sea  killed at least five people and wounded six, the Houthis said. The U.S. said the strikes, in two waves, took aim at targets in 28 different locations across Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen. We will make sure that we respond to the Houthis if they continue this outrageous behavior along with our allies, Biden told reporters during a stop in Emmaus, Pennsylvania. Asked if he believes the Houthis are a terrorist group, Biden responded, I think they are. The president in a later exchange with reporters during a stop in Allentown, Pennsylvania, said whether the Houthis are redesignated as such was irrelevant. Biden also pushed back against some lawmakers, both Democrats and Republicans, who said he should have sought congressional authorization before carrying out the strikes. Theyre wrong, and I sent up this morning when the strikes occurred exactly what happened, Biden said. The Pentagon said Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin ordered the military action from the hospital where he is recovering from complications following prostate cancer surgery. The White House said in November that it was considering redesignating the Houthis as a terrorist organization after they began their targeting of civilian vessels. The administration formally delisted the Houthis as a foreign terrorist organization and specially designated global terrorists in 2021, undoing a move by President Donald Trump Lt. Gen. Douglas Sims, director of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said Fridays U.S. strikes were largely in low-populated areas, and the number of those killed would not be high. He said the strikes hit weapons, radar and targeting sites, including in remote mountain areas. As the bombing lit the predawn sky over multiple sites held by the Iranian-backed rebels, it forced the world to again focus on Yemens yearslong war, which began when the Houthis seized the countrys capital. Since November, the rebels have repeatedly targeted ships in the Red Sea, saying they were avenging Israels offensive in Gaza against Hamas. But they have frequently targeted vessels with tenuous or no clear links to Israel, imperiling shipping in a key route for global trade and energy shipments. The Houthis military spokesman, Brig. Gen. Yahya Saree, said in a recorded address that the U.S. strikes would not go unanswered or unpunished. Though the Biden administration and its allies have tried to calm tensions in the Middle East for weeks and prevent any wider conflict, the strikes threatened to ignite one. Saudi Arabia  which supports the government-in-exile that the Houthis are fighting  quickly sought to distance itself from the attacks as it seeks to maintain a delicate détente with Iran and a cease-fire it has in Yemen. The Saudi-led, U.S.-backed war in Yemen has killed more than 150,000 people, including fighters and civilians, and created one of the worlds worst humanitarian disasters, killing tens of thousands more. It remained unclear how extensive the damage was from Fridays strikes, though the Houthis said at least five sites, including airfields, had been attacked. The White House said the U.S. military was still assessing the extent the militants capabilities might have been degraded. U.S. Air Forces Central Command said the strikes focused on the Houthis command and control nodes, munition depots, launching systems, production facilities and air defense radar systems. The strikes involved more than 150 precision-guided munitions including air-launched missiles by FA-18 Super Hornets based on the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower, and Tomahawk missiles from the Navy destroyers USS Gravely and USS Mason, the Navy cruiser USS Philippine Sea, and a U.S. submarine. The United Kingdom said strikes hit a site in Bani allegedly used by the Houthis to launch drones and an airfield in Abbs used to launch cruise missiles and drones. In a separate development, Iran released footage of its seizure of an oil tanker in the Gulf of Oman that once had been at the center of a dispute between Tehran and Washington. In the footage, a helicopter hovers over the deck of the St. Nikolas. Irans navy seized the vessel Thursday. The vessel had been known earlier as the Suez Rajan. The U.S. seized 1 million barrels of sanctioned Iranian oil off the vessel last year. In Yemen, Hussein al-Ezzi, a Houthi official in their Foreign Ministry, said, America and Britain will undoubtedly have to prepare to pay a heavy price and bear all the dire consequences of this blatant aggression. The Red Sea route is a crucial waterway, and attacks there have caused severe disruptions to global trade. Benchmark Brent crude oil traded up some 4 Friday at over 80 a barrel. Tesla, meanwhile, said it would temporarily halt most production at its German factory because of attacks in the Red Sea. In Saada, the Houthis stronghold in northwest Yemen, hundreds gathered for a rally Friday, denouncing the U.S. and Israel. Another drew thousands in Sanaa, the capital. Houthis now control territory that is home to some two-thirds of Yemens population of 34 million. War and misgovernment have made Yemen one of the poorest countries in the Arab world, and the World Food Program considers the vast majority of Yemens people as food-insecure. Yemen has been targeted by U.S. military action over the last four American presidencies. A campaign of drone strikes began under President George W. Bush to target the local affiliate of al-Qaida, attacks that have continued under the Biden administration. Meanwhile, the U.S. has launched raids and other military operations amid the ongoing war in Yemen. That war began when the Houthis swept into Sanaa in 2014. A Saudi-led coalition including the United Arab Emirates launched a war to back Yemens exiled government in 2015, quickly morphing the conflict into a regional confrontation as Iran backed the Houthis with weapons and other support. The conflict, however, has slowed as the Houthis maintain their grip on the territory they hold. In March, Saudi Arabia reached a Chinese-mediated deal to restart relations with Iran in hopes of ultimately withdrawing from the war. Iran condemned Fridays attack in a statement from Foreign Ministry spokesperson Nasser Kanaani. Arbitrary attacks will have no result other than fueling insecurity and instability in the region, he said. At an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council late Friday, Russian Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia accused the U.S., U.K. and allies of blatant armed aggression against Yemen and warned if the escalation continues, the entire Middle East could encounter a catastrophe. U.S. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield and U.K. Ambassador Barbara Woodward insisted the attacks were in self-defense. So de-escalation needs to happen, Thomas-Greenfield said. It needs to happen from the Houthis who are putting all of our shipping lines in jeopardy. Source: Associated Press -Agencies",

        "title": "Original 1998 Friends scripts discovered in trash bin auctioned off for over 36,000",
        "date": "January 13, 2024 02:34 pm",
        "content": "The cult-favorite sitcom Friends may have aired its final episode back in 2004, but a recent auction made it apparent that no love has been lost in the hearts and minds of fans over the last 20 years. In fact, fans remain so dedicated, they were willing to shill out five-digit prices to get their hands on a piece of the shows history. Original 1998 scripts from two episodes, The One With Rosss Wedding I and The One With Rosss Wedding II, went up for auction on Dec. 12 by Hertfordshire, England auction house Hanson Ross with an estimated value of 600-800 (765-1,021 USD). Instead, bidders went crazy, according to a statement from Hanson Ross, and scripts sold for a mind-blowing 28,864, or 36,896 USD. Hanson Ross said the scripts were originally found in a trash bin 26 years ago after the episodes wrapped up filming at Fountain Studios, Wembley, a studio that no longer exists. A now-retired 60-year-old employee of the location said she spotted the scripts, which actors were supposed to destroy after filming to prevent endings from leaking, weeks after filming had finished. It was part of my job to ensure everything was tidy and no rubbish was left around, the retired employee told Hanson Ross. I wasnt sure what to do with them so just put them in my office drawer. I remember wondering which member of the cast they might have belonged to. She left her job at Fountain Studios a year later and promptly forgot she had the scripts when packing her office up into a cardboard box. It was only months later that she discovered them in a pile of paperwork and relocated them to her bedside drawer, where they remained until now. Recently, she came across the scripts once more and found a ticket belonging to a studio audience member inside one of them. It was then that she decided to get the memorabilia evaluated. It will be exciting to see what they make at auction, she told Hanson Ross. Funnily enough, Im not a big Friends fan. I dont dislike the show but I only recently watched the episodes I have the scripts for. American humor is different to ours. These scripts deserve to be owned by a big Friends fan. While Hanson Ross originally valued the scripts at roughly 600-800 (765-1,021 USD), the enduring popularity of the show, cult following and the recent passing of star Matthew Perry were expected to drive the price even higher. Orginally, Hanson Rosss head of operations Amanda Butler said in a statement that they were ...guiding them at 600-800 but thanks to the shows huge global appeal who knows where the hammer may fall. Indeed, a phenomenal global interest ended up driving the bids up by 32 times the original max estimated price, with 219 advanced bids coming in from the UK, USA, Germany, Spain, Australia, Ukraine, Dubai, Switzerland and other countries. I just cant believe the result and the impact this find has had. Bidders went crazy for these scripts. The global interest was phenomenal, Butler said. Weve all been flabbergasted - including the seller. She came to the saleroom to watch the drama unfold and she was shell-shocked! What Friends episodes are the scripts from? The 1998 scripts are for episodes The One With Rosss Wedding I and The One With Rosss Wedding II. In this two-episode arc, Monica (Courteney Cox), Rachel (Jennifer Aniston), Joey (Matt LeBlanc), and Chandler (Matthew Perry), travel to London to see Ross (David Schwimmer) marry his fiancée Emily (Helen Baxendale) in London. Phoebe (Lisa Kudrow), stays home as she is heavily pregnant. Rachel flies out to meet up with her friends after initially staying behind, saying it would be too hard to watch her ex-boyfriend get married. By the end of part one, she decides she needs to confess her enduring love for Ross before he goes through with the marriage. While her friends convince her not to go through with sabotaging his big day, Friends fans know Ross and Rachel are destined to end up together and the wedding is ruined when Ross accidentally says I, Ross, take thee Rachel during his vows. The two-part season finale ended on a cliffhanger until the premier of season five when even more drama ensued in the episode, The One After Ross Says Rachel. Source: USA Today --Agencies",

Accordingly, the Colombo Magistrates Court has ordered the arrested suspected to be detained until 19 January 2024 for further investigations, Ada Derana reported said. The Colombo Crimes Division (CCD) arrested 08 persons suspected to have links with the criminal figure in the Weligama and Athurugiriya areas last evening (12). Police said the suspects were arrested on suspicion of being involved with the ill-famed criminal figure who is currently detained by the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) under the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA). Harak Kata was arrested in Madagascar along with his infamous accomplice Salindu Malshika alias Kudu Salindu on March 01, 2023, in a joint operation by the INTERPOL and Malagasy law enforcement authorities and Customs officials and was subsequently repatriated to Sri Lanka. Harak Kata had been wanted by Sri Lanka Police for his involvement in multiple murders and robberies as well as transnational drug trafficking.",

        "date": "January 13, 2024 04:01 pm",
        "content": "The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights has raised deep concerns about the ongoing anti-drug operation Yukthiya in Sri Lanka, stating that the authorities are adopting a heavily security-based response to the countrys drug problem. In a statement on Friday (Jan.12), the UN human rights chief Volker Türk noted that the authorities should instead adopt a response based on public health policies grounded in human rights. A staggering 29,000 people have reportedly been arrested on drug related matters since 17 December, with allegations that some have been subjected to ill-treatment and torture. Security forces have reportedly conducted raids without search warrants, detaining suspected drug sellers and users, with hundreds sent to military-run rehabilitation centres. During and after these operations, people are reported to have been subjected to a number of violations, including unauthorised searches, arbitrary arrests and detention, ill-treatment, torture, and strip searches in public. Lawyers acting for those detained have alleged that they have faced intimidation from police officers. While acknowledging that drug use presents a serious challenge to society, the UN human rights chief said the heavy-handed law enforcement approach is not the solution. He noted that drug abuse and the factors that lead to it are first and foremost public health and social issues. Raising alarm about the reports of violations concerning the operation, Türk said people suspected of selling or trafficking drugs are entitled to humane treatment, with full respect for due process and transparent, fair trials. Türk said people who use drugs should be provided with appropriate support and programs that address the root causes of addiction and assist their reintegration into society. He urged the Sri Lankan government to refer the UN Human Rights Office last year issued a report calling on States to develop effective drug policies, including by considering the decriminalisation of drug use and the possession of drugs for personal use. The UN rights chief urged the Sri Lankan government to review the Yukthiya operation and to implement human rights-based approaches, notably the right to health, to address the illicit drugs-related issues prevalent in society. Allegations of abuse of authority, torture and ill-treatment and denial of due process and fair trial rights must be thoroughly and impartially investigated, and justice must be served.",

        "date": "January 13, 2024 04:02 pm",
        "content": "A pair of alien mummies that mysteriously turned up at the airport in Perus capital last October have entirely Earthly origins, according to a scientific analysis revealed on Friday. The two small specimens were described as humanoid dolls by experts at a press conference in Lima, and likely fashioned from both human and animal parts. A separate three-fingered hand believed to be from Perus Nazca region was also analyzed, with experts ruling out any connection to alien life. Theyre not extraterrestrials. Theyre dolls made from animal bones from this planet joined together with modern synthetic glue, said Flavio Estrada, an archeologist with Perus Institute for Legal Medicine and Forensic Sciences. Its totally a made-up story, Estrada added. The two figurines turned up in the Lima airport offices of courier DHL in a cardboard box, and were made to look like mummified bodies dressed in traditional Andean attire. Some media outlets subsequently speculated about possible alien origin. Last September, two tiny mummified bodies with elongated heads and hands with three fingers were featured at a Mexican congressional hearing, generating widespread media coverage. Mexican journalist and UFO enthusiast Jaime Maussan claimed those bodies were about 1,000 years old and recovered from Peru in 2017, but not related to any known species. Most experts later dismissed them as a fraud, possibly mutilated ancient human mummies combined with animal parts, but certainly from Earth. At the Lima press conference on Friday, which was organized by Perus culture ministry, experts did not say that the dolls found in the DHL office were related to the bodies presented in Mexico, and they stressed that the remains in Mexico are also not extraterrestrial.

Shares of Microsoft climbed more than 3 for the week, bringing the companys market cap to 2.89 trillion, while Apples stock dropped by over 3, lowering its valuation to 2.87 trillion. Redburn Atlantic Equities analyst James Cordwell downgraded Apple to neutral from buy on Wednesday, citing little room for upside over the next few years in iPhone growth and an anticipated underwhelming March quarter. Apple said Thursday that former Vice President Al Gore will retire from the companys board next month after serving as a director since 2003. Microsoft, meanwhile, got a vote of confidence Thursday after discussing its artificial intelligence capabilities to developers at an event in San Francisco. Piper Sandler analysts told clients in a note that they were encouraged by the momentum around the most mature AI products and mentioned that GitHub website traffic has accelerated year over year for three months in a row. The analysts have the equivalent of a buy rating on Microsoft shares.

Lai, the current vice president, was in a three-way race with Hou Yu-ih from the conservative Kuomintang (KMT) and former Taipei Mayor Ko Wen-je from the Taiwan Peoples Party, which was only founded in 2019. Lai took 40.2 percent of votes cast, partial results from the Central Election Commission showed. Hou conceded defeat on Saturday and congratulated Lai on his victory. He also apologised to KMT supporters for not being able to remove the DPP. Ko also conceded defeat. I want to thank the Taiwanese people for writing a new chapter in our democracy, Lai said in a victory speech where he thanked his two opponents for conceding. We are telling the international community that between democracy and authoritarianism, we will stand on the side of democracy. The results were counted from 98 percent of polling stations across the island, according to the commission tally, which also showed that Hou had trailed with 33.4 percent of the vote. Taiwans elections carry an outsized importance because of the territorys disputed political status. While de facto independent since the 1940s, China still claims the island and its outlying territories and has not ruled out the use of force to achieve its ambitions. In the run-up to the polls, China denounced Lai as a dangerous separatist, said he would be a threat to peace in the region if he won, and called the elections a choice between war and peace. In his victory speech, Lai said the self-ruled island had managed to see off attempts to influence its election, in a swipe at China. The Taiwanese people have successfully resisted efforts from external forces to influence this election, he said. Lai has maintained that he is committed to peace and open to conditional engagement with Beijing, while also boosting the islands defences. Voters also elected politicians to Taiwans 113-seat legislature in elections closely watched by China and the United States. The DPP has been in power for the past eight years under President Tsai Ing-wen. Some 19.5 million people aged 20 and over were eligible to vote, and voter turnout was expected to be high based on public transit data. Taiwanese are required to return to the location of their household registration  typically their home town  to vote in person, which means the leadup to elections is a busy time for the island-wide rail service. On Friday, the Taiwan Railway Administration predicted a record 758,000 in ticket sales  higher than any previous election. Source: Al Jazeera --Agencies",

Issuing the circular, the Finance Ministry emphasized that in the current challenging economic environment, the fiscal space has become extremely limited due to the increase in public expenditure and limited government revenue. Furthermore, it stated that since cost reduction has been recognized as a priority in the short-term plans on the path to economic recovery, government expenditures should be frugal, regulations and circulars to reduce costs should be strictly adhered to, and cost control strategies should be used to suit the nature of each institution. However, the Ministry of Finance has instructed all public institutions through the circular that government funds should not be used for conducting festivals, gatherings, exhibitions, convocations, opening ceremonies, conferences, etc., except for the functions specified in the annual estimates as national festivals and for which the provisions have been earmarked. In addition, it is also mentioned that in order to avoid sudden purchases, needs should be identified early, and procurement activities must be implemented in accordance with approved procurement plans to minimize delays. The circular allows no new recruitment to fill vacancies even for essential positions without due approval of the Management Services Department. The government organizations in commercial form that do not receive funding from the treasury are instructed to take all possible measures to cover their expenses and they should not request funding from the treasury in consideration of the lack of income, as per the circular. Furthermore, the ministries, departments and all government institutions are ordered to make arrangements to ensure that the provisions of the relevant circular and the methods of cost management are implemented during the audit and management committee meetings.",

        "date": "January 14, 2024 12:11 am",
        "content": "Japan has informed that in order to commence the stalled projects, Sri Lanka must repay due for the cancellation of Colombo Light Rail Transit Project (LRT). The Japanese Finance Minister Suzuki Shunichi, who was on a two-day official visit to the island-nation has reportedly emphasized this, when he met President Ranil Wickremesinghe and the Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa. In March 2019, the Japanese government agreed to grant loan assistance of USD 1,800 million for the LRT system project which was to be implemented that year and completed by 2026, as a solution for the traffic congestion in the city of Colombo and its suburbs. Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) had agreed to provide financial facilities under concessionary credit conditions while the Oriental Consultants Global Company of Japan had agreed to provide consultancy services in collaboration with several other companies. On March 11, 2019, Japan and Sri Lanka signed the loan agreement and exchanged notes pertaining to the project, which had been designed to construct a 17km-long elevated rail track including 16 stations to cover important and major intersections from Malabe to Colombo Fort. Under the project, it had been proposed to deploy 25 trains for the service and each unit was supposed to comprise four air-conditioned passenger compartments to accommodate 800 passengers. The total estimated cost of the project was Japanese Yen 246,641 million, and JICA was to provide JPY 200,415 million (approximately USD 1,800 million) as a concessionary loan. The company had provided the facility of paying the said loan over a period of 40 years including a grace period of 12 years and the annual interest rate thereon was 0.1 percent. However, in September 2020, the then-Cabinet of Ministers gave the nod to terminate the project citing heavy operating costs, and environmental damage among other reasons. A report compiled by the National Audit Office in December 2022 revealed that Sri Lanka incurred a loss of Rs. 5,978 million after former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa-led government unilaterally terminated the LRT project. In May 2023, the current Cabinet of Ministers decided to green-light the revival of the project days before President Wickremesinghe departed for Japan for an official visit. The decision was taken in a bid to restore Sri Lankas credibility with the international community.",

Accordingly, the revision of the permissible levels of Aflatoxin had been discussed in the context of the Thriposha programme, provided under the Maternal and Child Health Program implemented by the Ministry. Nevertheless, since the Ministry of Health highlighted the difficulty in procuring maize for the production of Thriposha at the time, due to the stringent permissible limits for Aflatoxin as prescribed in the existing regulations under the Food Act No. 26 of 1980, it was proposed that the limitations imposed on Aflatoxin levels in internationally accredited food supplements (5ppb for type B1 and level 10 ppb of total Aflatoxin) be implemented to local food supplement programmes as well.",

        "date": "January 14, 2024 11:59 am",
        "content": "Canada is considering a cap on the number of international students allowed to live in Canada, Immigration Minister Marc Miller said according to a CTV report, as the government faces criticism for a housing affordability crisis. Canada depends on immigration to drive its economy and support an aging population and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has been ramping up annual immigration. The housing crisis has been blamed on an increase in migrants and international students fueling demand for homes just as inflation has slowed construction. Miller said in a taped interview with CTV Question Period that the Liberal government is considering a cap on international students in the first and second quarters this year. That volume is disconcerting, Miller is quoted by CTV as saying, referring to the number of international students in Canada. Its really a system that has gotten out of control. He did not say how much of a reduction in international students the government is considering. Millers spokesperson could not be immediately reached. Official data show there were more than 800,000 foreign students with active visas in 2022, up from 275,000 in 2012. The interview with Miller is scheduled to air on Sunday. Canada is a popular destination for international students since it is relatively easy to obtain a work permit. The Liberal government floated the idea of capping the number of foreign student visas in August, but Housing Minister Sean Fraser said then that the government had not yet made a decision of whether to pursue that option. Miller said he planned to discuss the problem with provincial counterparts. Trudeaus Liberals have seen their popularity plummet after more than eight years in office, with polls placing them well behind the official opposition Conservatives led by Pierre Poilievre, who have criticized the government for not properly managing the housing issue.

        "date": "January 14, 2024 03:47 pm",
        "content": "The Emmy Awards, normally one of Hollywoods September red-carpet rituals, will take the stage on Monday in a strike-delayed ceremony to honor the best of television. HBOs Succession, about the wealthy but miserable Roy family, leads all nominees with 27 nods. It is widely expected to win its third best-drama trophy. Most shows on the list come from streaming services, which grabbed their highest share of nominations ever. Some of the shows aired as far back as June 2022. Nominations were announced in July 2023, and voting took place a month later. If you are predicting Emmy winners, you have to remember what the vibe was like back in August, said Joyce Eng, senior editor at the Gold Derby awards website. Organizers postponed the ceremony from its September date because Hollywood writers and actors were out on strike at the time. The labor disputes shut down production and promotion and forced broadcast TV networks to fill their fall schedules with re-runs and reality shows. With the strikes over, the Emmys will give Hollywood a chance to spotlight TV and streaming series such as best comedy nominee Abbott Elementary, which returns to Walt Disneys (DIS.N) ABC with new episodes next month. Abbott, which runs on a broadcast network, is an outlier. Nearly two-thirds of shows nominated streamed on platforms such as Netflix and Apple TV, data from Nielsens Gracenote found. That is the highest proportion for streaming services ever. Previously, Emmy wins would provide bragging rights to help build audiences for a cable or broadcast show. For streamers, winning the Emmy is more about branding and increasing their subscriber counts, media consultant Brad Adgate said. Comedian and Black-ish actor Anthony Anderson will host the Emmys gala, which will be broadcast live from downtown Los Angeles on the Fox TV network. SUCCESSION SWEEP? This years Emmys telecast could feel like a re-run of the last Sundays Golden Globes, which showered Succession with four awards. The show wrapped up its fourth and final season last May, settling the question of who would take over the Roy familys global media empire. Fifteen experts polled by the Gold Derby website were unanimous in picking Succession to win the drama trophy again. Some awards watchers said Succession also could sweep the four drama acting categories. Three Succession actors - Brian Cox, Kieran Culkin and Jeremy Strong - are competing against each other for best actor. That could pave the way for an upset by Pedro Pascal, star of dystopian video-game adaptation The Last of Us, said Variety senior awards editor Clayton Davis. He could benefit from a Succession vote split. Pascal, who is Chilean-American, would be the first Latino actor to win best actor in a drama. In comedy contests, two-time series winner Ted Lasso, about the American coach of a plucky British football team, leads the pack again. While the third season of the Apple TV show divided fans, clearly Emmy voters still love it, Eng said, noting the show received 21 nominations, its most ever. Lasso could be beaten, some prognosticators said, by Golden Globe winner The Bear, the story of a haute cuisine chef trying to turn around his familys Chicago sandwich shop. Amazon Freevees Jury Duty, about a real person who unwittingly takes part in a fake trial, also is in the mix. Beef, Netflixs road rage drama that claimed three Globes, is the favorite to win best limited series. Winners will be chosen by the roughly 20,000 performers, directors, producers and other members of the Television Academy. While the night could be a party for Succession, Davis cautioned that such a large group can make for unpredictable results. Anything can happen, and sometimes anarchy ensues, and we just get a crazy night, he said. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

Thereby, the Mahanayaka Theros have pointed out that instead of trying to isolate and find solutions to such events, which are carried out in order to corrupt the noble interpretation of the religion, it is time to prepare the necessary legal provisions to prevent such Dharma distortions and Sasana distortions from repeatedly occurring in the society. Furthermore, the Mahanayaka Theros have emphasized the urgent need to prepare necessary legal provisions to implement the law against such individuals who are trying to create social disturbances by misleading the Buddhist community by promoting such statements on social media and to regulate the promotion of such statements. Accordingly, the Mahanayaka Theros have sought prompt attention of the President who is committed to promoting and fostering the safety of Buddhasasana regarding the matter. 01.

        "date": "January 14, 2024 07:12 pm",
        "content": "Denmarks King Frederik X ascended the throne on Sunday, succeeding his mother, Queen Margrethe II, who formally abdicated after 52 years as monarch, with big crowds gathered in the capital to witness history. Margrethe, 83, stunned the nation on New Years Eve when she announced she planned to become the first Danish monarch in nearly 900 years to voluntarily relinquish the throne. The succession was formalized the moment Margrethe signed the declaration of her abdication during a meeting of the Council of State at parliament, the royal palace said. Denmark, one of the oldest monarchies in the world, does not have a coronation. The meeting was attended by government representatives, Margrethe, Frederik, 55, his Australian-born wife Mary, 51, who is now queen, and their oldest son Christian, 18, who is the new heir to the throne. About an hour after the signing, Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen was due to proclaim the new king on the balcony of the parliament and Frederik will give a short speech. In close to freezing temperatures, tens of thousands of people from all over Denmark converged on the capital to witness events, in a sign of the huge popularity the monarchy is enjoying in the nation of nearly six million. We have come here today because this is history being made in front of our eyes. We just had to be here, said Soren Kristian Bisgaard, 30, a pilot. He was drinking champagne with three friends, sitting in camping chairs in front of parliament. Im very fond of the royal family. I have been in the Royal Life Guards myself, standing guard at the royal palace. Im very proud to have done that and also to be here today, he said. Later in the afternoon, the new king and queen were due to ride by horse carriage back to their residence, Amalienborg, a royal complex built in the 1750s and located in central Copenhagen. The couple will continue to reside with Margrethe, who will retain her title as queen, in Amalienborg albeit in their respective palaces in the octagonal complex. ROYAL POWER COUPLE Margrethe, who in the past had said she would remain on the throne for life, did not give an exact reason for her decision to step down but said that a major back surgery she underwent in February last year had made her consider her future. It could be that she thinks Prince Frederik is prepared to take over now, said Lars Hovbakke Sorensen, a historian and associate professor at University College Absalon in Denmark. Hes 55, and maybe the queen wanted to avoid a situation where you would have a very, very old king, as you saw with Prince Charles. The British king was 73 when he ascended the throne after his mother Queen Elizabeth died in September 2022 aged 96. The new king and queen take the throne at a time of huge public support and enthusiasm for the monarchy. The most recent survey done after Margrethe announced she would abdicate indicated that 82 of Danes expect Frederik to do well or very well in his new role, while 86 said the same about Mary.

According to the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources, the 2,891-meter-high (9,500 feet) volcano began erupting at 6 a.m. local time (6 p.m.ET). The volcano in West Sumatra province erupted at least twice, the agency said according to Reuters. Reuters also reported nearby houses, vehicles and evacuation tents set up by the local disaster agency were covered in volcanic ash. The ministry warned residents and visitors not to go within a 4.5 kilometer (2.8 mile) radius of the Verbeek Crater where the eruption took place and told residents in nearby communities to wear masks in the event of falling ash. Some residents also went to health facilities to receive respiratory check-ups, Reuters added. A previous eruption on December 3 killed 23 hikers who were on the mountain at the time, and saw volcanic ash being spewed as high as 3,000 meters (9,843 feet) into the air. Mount Marapi is among the most active volcanoes in Indonesia which lies on the Pacific Ring of Fire with 127 active volcanos  more than anywhere else in the world. It has erupted 11 times during the early 21st century, with it deadliest single event having killed 60 people in 1979. Source: CNN --Agencies",

        "date": "January 15, 2024 01:29 am",
        "content": "The government had to bear an additional cost of Rs. 1,139 billion amidst the economic crisis last year due to cancellation of the term tender and importing Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) at higher rates, the Auditor Generals Department revealed. This was mentioned in a special audit report compiled on the procurement of liquefied petroleum gas Litro Gas Lanka Ltd for the years 2022 and 2023. The report indicates that despite having obtained the approval of the Cabinet of Ministers to grant the LP gas tender to the lowest bidder, the Singapore-based Siam Gas Trading Pte Ltd., steps had been taken to commence a new procurement process to buy gas at a higher rate. Accordingly, the government had to pay a higher rate for the purchase of liquefied petroleum gas, even in the face of an economic crisis, the Auditor Generals Department alleged. The Technical Evaluation Committee had recommended on April 26, 2022, that Siam Gas Trading, the lowest bidder, should be the supplier qualified for 2022-2023 period. The Procurement Committee also approved this on April 28, 2022. Later, on May 04, 2022, the Cabinet of Ministers gave the nod to select Siam Gas Trading as the LP gas supplier for the aforementioned period. The report says that the Board of Appeal, having considered the appeal made by the previous supplier OQ Trading Ltd. against the selection, had given its consent to award the procurement to Siam Gas Trading. However, despite the approvals so given, it had been decided to commence a new procurement process following the Cabinet Decision dated June 13, 2022, whilst gas was being purchased from OQ Trading Ltd. at a price exceeding that of Siam Gas Trading (CP 96) irrespective of the lack of a formal methodology for Sri Lanka to purchase gas since March 2022. The report revealed that the term procurement had been cancelled despite Siam Gas Trading having being selected, and, as gas had been purchased from OQ Trading Ltd. at a higher price, the government had incurred an additional expenditure of USD 3,145,960 (equivalent to Rs. 1,138,837,430 in total) amidst the economic crisis.",

        "title": "Artificial Intelligence will affect almost 40 jobs globally: IMF report",
        "date": "January 15, 2024 10:39 am",
        "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is projected to impact nearly 40 of global jobs, with advanced economies expected to bear a greater share of the consequences compared to emerging markets and low-income countries, according to an analysis by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) reported by Bloomberg. IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva wrote in a blog post that, in most scenarios, AI is likely to exacerbate overall inequality and called for proactive measures by policymakers to prevent the technology from further intensifying social tensions. The impact of AI on income inequality will hinge on how well the technology complements high earners. Increased productivity from high-income workers and companies could widen the wealth gap, Georgieva explained. According to the IMF chief, countries should implement comprehensive social safety nets and retraining programs for vulnerable workers to mitigate these effects. The IMF report, published on Sunday (14 January) evening, highlighted that, while there is potential for AI to fully replace some jobs, the more probable scenario is that it will complement human work. Advanced economies may witness about 60 of jobs affected, surpassing the impact on emerging and low-income countries. However, the report noted that only half of the jobs affected by AI will face negative consequences; the rest may benefit from enhanced productivity gains due to AI integration. Your job may disappear altogether - not good - or artificial intelligence may enhance your job, so you actually will be more productive and your income level may go up, Georgieva wrote. Georgievas comments align with discussions at the World Economic Forum in Davos, where global business and political leaders are deliberating on AI. Some companies have raised concerns among employees by investing heavily in AI, with examples such as Buzzfeed Inc. using AI for content creation and restructuring its news department. While the European Union has reached a tentative deal on AI legislation, the US is still considering its federal regulatory stance on the matter. The IMF report predicts that emerging markets and developing economies will experience a smaller initial impact from AI on labour markets but are also less likely to benefit from the productivity gains that AI integration may bring. The IMF chief stressed the importance of helping low-income countries seize the opportunities presented by artificial intelligence. While addressing the potential challenges of AI, she acknowledged its tremendous opportunity for everyone. She also acknowledged the need for an AI-related productivity boost to sustain global economic growth, emphasising the importance of unlocking productivity for a positive global narrative. The IMF is set to publish updated economic forecasts later this month, indicating that the global economy is broadly on track to meet previous projections. Georgieva cautioned that 2024 is likely to be a very tough year for fiscal policy worldwide due to countries addressing debt burdens from the Covid-19 pandemic and managing depleted buffers. With billions of people heading to the polls this year, Georgieva expressed concern that governments might face pressure to increase spending or cut taxes to gain popular support, potentially undermining progress made in the fight against high inflation.

        "content": "The Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) claims that the island-wide strike action organized by health sector employees is unjustified. The Secretary of the GMOA Dr. Haritha Aluthge expressed that 50 of the wage demands made by the trade unions which are protesting the governments decision to increase the Disturbance, Availability and Transport (DAT) allowance for doctors have been completed, and that only 15 of the requested increment have been received by the doctors. Their demand was to increase the salaries of government employees by Rs. 20,000. They have received Rs. 10,000 so far. It means that 50 of their demands are completed, he said. Dr. Aluthge also pointed out that the majority of the protesting health workers are related to the secondary level of government service, while another group of them are in the primary grade. The doctors are in the senior grade of the government service. This is hilarious that they are trying to be at the equal level as doctors, he said. This is something that is not happening; and something that must not happen. Furthermore, Dr. Aluthge emphasized that it is an illegal strike action. Against this backdrop, the All Ceylon Nurses Union has decided not to join the strike action to be launched jointly with over 75 health sector trade unions on Tuesday (16), but will only hold a demonstration in front of government hospitals during lunch time. The Chief Secretary of the union H.M.S Mediwatte stated that this decision was taken in consideration of the inconvenience faced by the patients during health sector employees strikes. He also expressed that the nursing officers from across the island will protest in front of the Health Ministry on Wednesday (17), and will launch a continuous trade union action until their demands are fulfilled. The health sector employees trade unions decided to launch another 24-hour token strike starting from 06.30 a.m. tomorrow (Jan. 16), in protest of the governments decision to increase DAT allowance for doctors by Rs. 35,000.

Last week, the day-to-day functions of many hospitals across the island had come to a standstill, owing to several trade union actions launched by several health sector employees demanding an allowance of Rs 35,000. On 08 January 2024, the Cabinet of Ministers gave the nod to President Ranil Wickremesinghes proposal to double the DAT allowance paid to government doctors, raising it from Rs. 35,000 to Rs. 70,000.",

        "title": "Intl rights groups urge govt to stop abusive anti-drug operation and release arbitrary detainees",
        "date": "January 15, 2024 03:34 pm",
        "content": "Over 30 international human rights organisations including Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and the International Commission of Jurists have expressed their deep concern regarding the drastic intensification of anti-drug operations in Sri Lanka leading to significant human rights violations. Issuing a joint statement, the 33 international organizations demand the Sri Lankan government to stop the abusive anti-drug operation and release the arbitrarily detained individuals. Furthermore, the statement highlights that this operation is unfolding in a context of already severe repression against persons who use or are suspected of using drugs, and who suffer discrimination and stigma within the Sri Lankan criminal justice system and society. Alongside the Sri Lankan police, members of the armed forces have been supporting this operation, during which several human rights violations have been reported. These violations include alleged arbitrary arrests, primarily against individuals from marginalised socio-economic communities; searches conducted without warrants or reasonable suspicion; and degrading treatment including strip searches in public as well as cavity searches. The searches and arrests have been televised, in violation not only of the right to privacy (and of basic human dignity) but also of a persons right to be presumed innocent, the joint statement added. The global organizations, which also point out that according to lawyers, persons are being arrested even when no drugs are found in their possession, simply for having been arrested for drug offences or having been sent to compulsory rehabilitation in the past, mention that the arrests of main livelihood earners and mothers have adversely impacted the ability of families to meet their basic needs during a time of economic crisis in Sri Lanka, and the wellbeing of children. Persons are being arrested primarily under Section 54A of the Poisons, Opium and Dangerous Drugs Ordinance, an offence which is non-bailable. As a result, those arrested are bound to spend time (sometimes months) in pretrial detention, thereby exacerbating already poor conditions of imprisonment in an overburdened prison system. Furthermore, the statement has drawn attention to the fact that the level of overcrowding of the prison system is at nearly 200 - with punitive drug policies playing a significant role: as of 2022, 63 of convicted persons were sentenced for drug-related offences, as per the statistics issued by the Department of Prisons. The aforesaid organizations have also expressed in this joint statement that the total number of arrests pursuant to operation Yukthiya has exceeded 29,000 as of 9 January 2024, while nearly 1,500 people are in administrative detention in police custody for further investigation and at least 1,600 more persons have been sent for compulsory drug rehabilitation, in violation of several fundamental rights; including the right to the highest attainable standard of health, which includes the right to consent to and withdraw from medical treatment. Drug treatment in these centres is abstinence-based, essential harm reduction services are not available, and persons undergo severe withdrawal symptoms without any medical assistance while in detention. The use of violence to discipline and punish has been reported in at least two compulsory drug rehabilitation centres which are within the purview of the Bureau of the Commissioner General for Rehabilitation and are operated by the military, which is in itself a violation of international standards, it added. The UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention in its statement at the conclusion of its visit to Sri Lanka 2017expressed concern regarding the involvement of military personnel in drug treatment and rehabilitation, the fact that strenuous physical exercise was the core component of compulsory drug treatment, and at the lack of trained professionals to monitor the health of people in detention. Furthermore, the statement highlighted the irregularities in the judicial process by which persons were sent to drug rehabilitation centres without a medical assessment, the statement mentioned. In addition, the organizations say that since the 2016 UN General Assembly Special Session on drugs, there is international consensus on pursuing a holistic and health and human rights-based approach to drugs, which encompasses supply and demand reduction as well as harm reduction. The 2019 Ministerial Declaration on drugs  the current global drug policy document - as well as multiple resolutions of the UN General Assembly, the UN Commission on Narcotic Drugs, and the UN Human Rights Council reiterate and recommend a similar approach, it added. Further, the joint statement clarified: a punitive and militarised approach to drug control contravenes recognised international human rights standards and guidelines, is ineffective to protect individual and public health, and ultimately fails to make communities safer. Thereby, the 33 global organizations call upon the Government of Sri Lanka to immediately cease operation Yukthiya and release persons who have been arrested without evidence or reasonable suspicion. The government should ensure that those arrested who do not have access to legal representation are provided legal aid, they stressed. Through the statement, it is also demanded to immediately release persons arrested or sent to compulsory drug rehabilitation for using drugshaving a drug dependence, cease involving the armed forces in drug control and treatment activities as consistent with human rights law, repeal laws that allow compulsory drug rehabilitation, close compulsory treatment centres and release persons presently held at the centres within the purview of the Bureau of Commissioner General for Rehabilitation. Additionally, they have called the government to ensure that any law enforcement operation to address the supply side is conducted respecting due process standards and constitutionally protected fundamental rights.

        "date": "January 15, 2024 05:59 pm",
        "content": "Apple is offering rare discounts on its iPhones in China, cutting retail prices by as much as 500 yuan (70) amid growing competitive pressure in the worlds biggest smartphone market. The U.S. tech giant cut prices of some iPhones by 5, its Chinese website showed on Monday. The time-limited promotion, branded as a Lunar New Year event, will last from Jan. 18 through Jan. 21 in a lead-up to the holiday in mid-February. Sales of Apples latest iPhone 15 series of handsets have been far worse than previous models in China. Home-grown rivals such as Huawei Technologies and Xiaomi offer competitive models, while sources have said some companies and government departments have been limiting staffers use of Apple devices - mirroring U.S. government restrictions of Chinese apps on security grounds. Chinese iPhone sales dropped 30 in the first week of 2024 versus the same period a year earlier, Jefferies analysts said in a client note, having fallen 3 for all of 2023. Analysts expect the competitive landscape to get tougher this year. Apple has not cut prices for its latest iPhones in years. The cuts come after it surprised the market by not raising prices for the iPhone 15 series at its September launch. Online shopping platforms including Pinduoduo have been slashing prices of the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Pro by as much as 16 since the beginning of the year. Nicole Peng, senior vice president of market research firm Canalys, said the discounts did not come as a surprise as Apple is under pressure to boost sales globally, and especially in China, amid intensifying competition and Apple fans growing reluctance to upgrade. It is clear that Huawei is making a comeback, Peng said, Some Chinese consumers may return to using Huawei as driven by patriotism. Canalys expects Apple sales this year to stay flat worldwide while suffering a slight decline in China. Apple did not respond to a request for comment. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "date": "January 15, 2024 06:47 pm",
        "content": "An ethnic armed group in the western Myanmar state of Rakhine said it has taken control of a town bordering India and Bangladesh, marking the latest loss for the military government as it battles rebellion in several parts of the country. Myanmar is in the throes of an insurgency on multiple fronts, where allied anti-junta groups backed by a pro-democracy parallel government have seized control of several military posts and towns. It is the biggest challenge the junta has faced since it mounted a coup against an elected government in 2021. A spokesperson for the Arakan Army (AA) said late on Sunday it had conquered Paletwa, a port town on the Kaladan river that is key to trade with neighbouring countries. Regarding border stability issues, we will cooperate at our best with neighbouring countries, said AA spokesperson Khine Thu Kha in a statement, adding the group will take over administration and law enforcement in the area. A spokesperson for the junta did not respond to a request for comment. Reuters could not independently verify the AAs claim. The fall of Paletwa in the west comes after another rebel group in the Three Brotherhood Alliance took Laukkai town on the in northern Shan State on the border with China. Last week, the junta agreed a ceasefire with that group, the TNLA, for the region bordering China. The talks were held in the Chinese city of Kunming and facilitated by Chinese officials. But on Sunday, the rebel alliance said junta forces are breaching the ceasefire agreement, launching attacks in several townships in Shan State. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

On January 04, the suspect had attacked a 14-year-old child with a sword over a dispute that had occurred between the two groups of people, the police said. It is reported that a finger of the childs left hand had been severed due to the sword attack. However, the suspect, Dilruk Prashantha Silva, a father-of-three, had surrendered to police after evading arrest for 11 days, following the discharge of the victim from the hospital, the police said. Nevertheless, on Sunday (15) Welisara Magistrate Thusitha Dhammika Uduwawidana ordered the suspect to be remanded in custody, after considering a request made by Ragama Police stating that the investigations are still underway in search of the sword used in the attack. Attorney-at-Law Shamindra Soysa, who appeared on behalf of the victimized child before the courts, had previously filed a motion alleging that the police, who had arrested the suspect previously, had released the suspect due to the pressure exerted on the investigating officers by a senior police officer. The magistrate, who took all facts presented into consideration, ordered the case to be recalled on January 19, 2024 and also ordered the police to report the progress of the investigations related to the case to the courts on the aforementioned date.",

        "content": "Indian billionaire Mukesh Ambani has plans to expand his horizons in the telecommunications business through his firm Jio Platforms, expressing interest in buying stake in Sri Lanka Telecom PLC, the state-owned telecom company, Indian media reported. The Sri Lankan government has been struggling with the cash-strapped Telecom PLC, as current authorities continue to push for privatisation of many sectors to revive the economy amid the recent financial crisis. Sri Lankan government had invited applications from potential bidders for Sri Lanka Telecom PLC by November 10, and Mukesh Ambanis Jio Platforms was one of three companies that expressed interest in buying the stake of the firm, reported Moneycontrol. The Sri Lankan government on January 12 issued a press release where it named Jio Platforms as one of the potential bidders for their government telecom company. Apart from Jio, the other two companies in the running are Gortune International Investment Holding Ltd and Pettigo Comercio International LDA. The press release further said that the proposals by the company will be evaluated as per the Special Guidelines on Divestiture of State-Owned Enterprises approved by the Cabinet of Ministers. Sri Lanka has been mandated by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to push for the privatisation of all the non-core sectors in the country, in order to pull the Sri Lanka out of the deep cash shortage that triggered the anti-government protests in 2022. With the Sri Lankan investment, Reliances Jio Platform is hoping to enter and dominate the global telecom market. Currently, Jio is market leader among all Indian telecom service providers. Latest figures released by Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) showed that Jio added 31.59 lakh mobile users in October 2023, significantly more that top competitor Bharti Airtel. Recently, Reliance and Jio shares rallied on the stock market after Mukesh Ambanis investment announcements at Vibrant Gujarat Summit 2024 in Gandhinagar last week. The jump in shares led to Mukesh Ambani reclaiming the spot of the richest person in Asia. Source: Hindustan Times --Agencies",

Led by Peter Brueur, the International Monetary Fund senior mission chief for Sri Lanka, the team last week met with the Governor of the Northern province, PMS Charles, and other senior officials and discussed issues related to economic growth in the province, demining programmes, resettlement of conflict-displaced individuals and compensation for conflict victims. They also discussed the educational matters related to Jaffna University, post-COVID operations, and the adverse effects of climate change on the northern region, the officials said. The team, which returned to Colombo on Monday, is scheduled to engage with the finance ministry. Talks are expected with Shehan Semasinghe, the state minister of finance, who leads the local IMF engagement under President Ranil Wickremesinghe. The discussions in Colombo are anticipated to focus on the targets outlined in the current IMF programme, which advocates large scale economic reforms in the island nation. In a meeting with President Wickremesinghe on Thursday last, Brueur had expressed satisfaction with Sri Lankas progress in implementing reforms aimed at revitalising the economy. The global lender had commended Sri Lanka for its advancements in policy-oriented variables and fiscal consolidation. Sri Lanka, which declared its first-ever debt default in April 2022, had secured an IMF bailout agreement of USD 2.9 billion over four years by the last quarter of 2022.

        "date": "January 16, 2024 07:12 am",
        "content": "A lack of snowfall has led to empty ski resorts and holiday cancellations in the Indian Himalayas, with scientists linking the unusual winter to the El Nino weather phenomenon. The dry spell in Kashmir has pushed skiers to skip the popular resort of Gulmarg, one of the highest in the world, and left hotels in the scenic region waiting for fresh falls to draw tourists to the panoramic views of snow-capped peaks. Scientists said that this winters conditions in northern India have not been seen for about a decade, marked by the absence of snowfall in the mountains and biting cold made worse by thick fog in the plains. Fifty percent of the season is already gone, said Farhat Naik, 35, a Gulmarg snowboard instructor, ruing at the sight of dry, barren land that would normally be covered in a knee-deep layer of snow. We are now hoping for snowfall in February first week, he said, adding that all his European and American clients have cancelled their trips due to a lack of snow - a blow to the tourism and agriculture focused economy of the region. Travel industry executives in the neighbouring states of Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand also complained of cancellations. Bookings have dropped to 20 for Blue Poppy Resort in the ski resort of Auli, in Uttarakhand, its owner Kushaal Sangwan said. Our cancellations have jumped and people cancel (just) days before the booking if there is no snow. Winter snow and rain in northern India, including the Himalayas, is brought by a weather pattern known as the western disturbances - frequent extra-tropical storms that originate in the Mediterranean Sea. There are usually many such storms during winter but they have been largely absent this season, said R.K. Jenamani, a senior scientist at the India Meteorological Department (IMD). When theres no weather system, how can there be (snow), he said. The disappearance of western disturbances is linked to changing wind patterns and rising temperatures due to the active El Nino weather phenomenon and also climate change, said Gufran Beig, a former chief scientist at the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology. The current weather was very unusual for this time, Beig said. Its January and it is still very cold in Delhi ... there is excess moisture in the air but theres also no snow ... Its been one of the most polluted and prolonged stretches of winter. Source: Reuters -Agencies",

Accordingly, the strike action, led by the Health Service Trade Unions, represents a wide range of health sector professionals, including radiology and laboratory technicians, pharmacists and drug compounders, midwives, Public Health Inspectors, and entomology officers, and is slated to continue until 06:30 a.m. tomorrow (17 Jan.). Meanwhile, Health Minister Ramesh Pathirana has invited the trade unions for a discussion this evening, however, Convenor of the Union Ravi Kumudesh warned that the strike will continue in the event unnecessary measures are taken against the unions. Speaking with regards to the strike on Monday (15 Jan.), President of the Paramedical Services Front (PMSF) Upul Rohana stressed that because Minsiter Pathirana is yet to provide any discussion regarding their demands, around 100,000 health workers including all paramedical services, hospital secretaries, administrative officers as well as health administrative assistants, minor staff and 75 other trade unions of the health staff will join together with this island-wide strike. This action will completely disrupt the hospital service. The government should understand that it is not possible to maintain medical services only with the doctors, Upul Rohana said. The trade union action was launched in protest of the governments decision to increase the Disturbance, Availability and Transport (DAT) allowance for doctors by Rs. 35,000.",

Meanwhile, in response to a question raised by a journalist regarding whether he invited former captain Angelo Mathews to join the T20 squad, Hasaranga emphasized that Mathews is not a retired player and that therefore, there is no need to invite him to the team as he is already in it. Angelo Mathews is not a retired player. We could see the performance of a well-experienced player like Mathewsthe way he batted until the end of a match so easily.

        "content": "Dense fog swathed large parts of northern India on Tuesday for the third straight day of an intense cold wave, reducing visibility to disrupt more than 160 flights. As many as 128 flights from the international airport in New Delhi, the capital, were delayed, with 33 cancelled, aviation site Flightradar24 showed, an effect that cascaded through flight schedules nationwide. Visibility at the airport stood at 50 m (164 ft) at 8 a.m., weather officials said, predicting similar conditions until the end of the week. New Delhis lowest temperature this winter was 3.3 degrees Celsius (37.4 degrees Farenheit) on Monday, when low visibility and dense fog caused the delay of as many as 500 flights and the cancellation of 87. Angry passengers argued with airline staff in images on television and social media, with one video showing passengers eating dinner as they waited on the tarmac for a delayed flight. On Monday, the aviation minister said authorities were hastening efforts to use an additional runway, equipped with the CAT III navigation system that enables aircraft to land despite low visibility.

        "date": "January 16, 2024 11:03 am",
        "content": "A recent government audit report on the management of overcrowding in prisons has revealed that the prisons capacity has exceeded by 232. The performance audit claimed that upon consideration of the data gathered for the last seven years, from 31 December 2015 to 31 December 2022, the number of inmates in the overall prison system in Sri Lanka has increased from 139 to 232 of capacity in Prisons. This percentage increased from 149 to 213 from the beginning of 2016 to the end of 2019, and subsequently dropped to 139 by 31 December 2021. The reason for that was, the increase of prison capacity from 11,762 to 13,241(that is by 12.5) by the end of 2020, the report reads in this regard. Despite the prison capacity having increased, however, the number of inmates too, have increased, thereby yet again giving rise to the issue of overcrowding, with the highest number of inmates exceeding the prison capacity being recorded in 2022. The average monthly number of detainees held in the 12 months of the year 2022 is 22,097 and it has grown by 15 per cent as compared to the average monthly number of 19,295 detainees in 2021, the report read. The overcrowding in prisons has also led to several other issues, including a lack of adequate space and sanitation facilities. As per the performance audit, there was a shortage of 187 toilets in 27 prisons, and 287 of the existing toilets were in a condition of repair, while 14 prisons across the island have a shortage of 108,689 square feet of space. Meanwhile, the insufficient space for female inmates in cells and wards in the Negombo and Vavuniya prisons as at 01 July 2022 was 240 and 141 square feet respectively. The report further identified two reasons behind the overcrowding of prisons; one being the influence of the economic, social, political and legal environment, in the context that difficulties faced during the economic crisis lead to higher rates of criminal activity which thereby lead to increased arrests, while the other reason was identified as the increase in imprisonments related to drug offences. A large number of Sri Lankan inmates have been involved in drug offenses. The number of prison inmates in Sri Lanka is 26,176, of which over 53 per cent, i.e. 13,794, are inmates related to drug offenses as at 31 December 2022, the audit revealed. The report further noted, however, that despite the rise in arrests and imprisonment is a direct result of increased criminal activity and subsequent overcrowding in prisons, the audit further highlighted that deficiencies in the administrative process related to law enforcement for criminals and imprisonment have also led to the creation of prison overcrowding.

        "title": "Iowa caucus 2024: Trump dominates, DeSantis edges Haley for second",
        "date": "January 16, 2024 11:15 am",
        "content": "Donald Trump secured a resounding victory in the first 2024 Republican presidential contest in Iowa on Monday, asserting his command over the party despite facing scores of criminal charges as he seeks a rematch with Democratic President Joe Biden. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, 45, finished well behind in second place, edging out former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley, 51, as they battle to emerge as the chief alternative to Trump. Trump, 77, won by an unprecedented margin for an Iowa Republican contest, strengthening his case that his nomination is a foregone conclusion given his massive lead in national polls. THANK YOU IOWA, I LOVE YOU ALL!!! Trump wrote on his social media platform, Truth Social. With 95 of the expected vote tallied, Trump had 51, while DeSantis was at 21 and Haley 19, according to Edison Research. The largest margin of victory for an Iowa Republican caucus had been 12.8 percentage points for Bob Dole in 1988. Entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy ended his long-shot presidential bid after earning just under 8 of the vote on Monday and endorsed Trump in a speech to supporters. If Trump finishes above 50, winning more than all his rivals combined, it will further weaken his opponents argument that his march to the nomination can be derailed. His performance reflected his popularity among Republican voters - even after two impeachments, his involvement in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol by a mob of supporters and his 91 criminal charges for trying to overturn the 2020 election, retaining classified documents after leaving the White House and falsifying records connected to hush money payments to a porn star. Nearly two-thirds of caucus-goers embraced his false claims about voter fraud, saying they did not think Biden legitimately won the presidency. More than 60 said Trump would still be fit to serve as president even if convicted of a crime. Trump dominated across the board, according to an Edison entrance poll: he won a majority among men and among women; among those who consider themselves very conservative, somewhat conservative and independent; among those who graduated college and those who did not. He captured a majority of Republicans who put immigration as their top concern - and a majority of those who said the economy was their main worry. The Iowa caucus results demonstrate the strength of Trumps grip on the Republican Party, said Jimmy Centers, an Iowa-based Republican strategist. Absent a quick consolidation of the field, Trump appears to be on a fast track to the nomination. That consolidation appears unlikely, with both DeSantis and Haley vowing to press ahead following Mondays results, ensuring Trumps opposition will remain fractured as the campaign moves to other states. DeSantis in particular had wagered his campaign on Iowa, barnstorming all of its 99 counties and pouring resources into the state. Weve got our ticket punched out of Iowa! DeSantis told supporters in West Des Moines on Monday. Haley, who has enjoyed a steady rise in polls over the last few months, sought to position herself as the leading Trump challenger. At one point in this campaign there were 14 of us running. I was at 2 in the polls, Haley told a crowd of supporters. When you look at how were doing, in New Hampshire, in South Carolina and beyond, I can safely say tonight Iowa made this Republican primary a two-person race. Republicans in more moderate New Hampshire will choose their nominee eight days from now. Polls show Trump with a smaller lead over Haley there, with DeSantis far behind. Trump has aimed to create an air of inevitability around his campaign, skipping all five of the Republican debates thus far and largely eschewing the county-by-county politicking that most candidates do ahead of the Iowa vote. LIFE-THREATENING COLD Iowans braved life-threatening temperatures to gather at more than 1,600 schools, community centers and other sites for the states first-in-the-nation caucus, as the 2024 presidential campaign officially got under way after months of debates, rallies and advertisements. Trump is very narcissistic, hes very cocky, but hes going to get stuff done, said Rita Stone, 53, a Trump backer, who attended a caucus at a West Des Moines high school. Like many other voters, Stone said her leading concern was the U.S. southern border with Mexico, praising Trumps effort to build a wall when he was president. Unlike a regular election, Iowas caucus requires voters to gather in person in small groups, where they cast secret ballots after speeches from campaign representatives. Edison projected there would be approximately 120,000 votes counted, far short of the record 187,000 cast in the 2016 Republican caucus. With the cold weather depressing turnout, Trumps grip on his most loyal supporters may have given him an edge. Iowa Democrats did not vote on Monday for their presidential nominees because the party has reshuffled its nominating calendar to put states with more diverse populations ahead of Iowa this year. They will cast their ballots by mail, with the results to be released in March. Iowa has historically played an outsized role in presidential campaigns due to its early spot on the campaign calendar. But the winner of Iowas Republican caucuses did not go on to secure the nomination in the last three competitive contests in 2008, 2012 and 2016. A political battleground that backed Democrat Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012, the state is now seen as reliably Republican in presidential elections as registered Republicans edge out Democrats.

        "date": "January 16, 2024 11:19 am",
        "content": "The air quality has declined in several areas of the island, the Central Environmental Authority (CEA) said. The Media Spokesman ofre the CEA Ajith Weerasundara stated that accordingly a decline in the air quality index is observed in the Colombo, Jaffna, Mannar and Galle areas. Weerasundara also took into note that as a result patients with respiratory issues and respiratory-related medical conditions should be more attentive regarding the matter. Furthermore, he expressed that the major cause of this situation is the entry of various types of air pollutants by way of the air currents passing through the island, especially the wind currents from the outer regions of other countries, such as the Bay of Bengal. The authority also emphasized that there is a minor possibility of this situation affecting the health of the people living in those areas. Especially people living in these areas who suffer some kinds of lung-related disorders like Asthma should be careful up to a level. As an example, if you wear facemasks, you can protect your health, Weerasundara said. We believe that this situation will gradually subside and return back to normal in a few days. Here we especially request you to pay attention to the condition of the atmosphere, he added. Meanwhile, the air quality in New Delhi, India continues to linger between very poor and severe, whilst Delhi residents once again confronted dense fog and bone-chilling cold, causing widespread flight and rail operations disruptions, the foreign media reported on Tuesday (Jan. 16). The air quality of Indias Delhi (272) ranked first as the poorest air quality in the world and Indias Kolkata (154) is third on the list, according to IQAir. The AQI (Air Quality Index), used to communicate to the general public the daily air quality, is based on the measurement of particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10), Ozone (O3), Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2), Sulfur Dioxide (SO2) and Carbon Monoxide (CO) emissions. An AQI value of 50 or below represents good air quality, while an AQI value over 300 represents hazardous air quality, as per international standards.",

        "date": "January 16, 2024 12:20 pm",
        "content": "Succession secured its legacy with its third best drama series award, The Bear feasted as the nights top comedy, and the two shows about squabbling families dominated the acting awards at Monday nights Emmys. Quinta Brunson of Abbott Elementary and Steven Yeun and Ali Wong of Beef also had historic wins at the 75th Primetime Emmy Awards, in a Martin Luther King Jr. Day ceremony that was finally held four months late after a turbulent year of strikes in Hollywood. Succession, the HBO saga of the dysfunctional generations of a maladjusted media empire, won the top prize for its fourth and final season. It also won best actress in a drama for Sarah Snook and best actor in a drama for Kieran Culkin. We all put our all into it, and the bar was set so high, Snook said. The Bear, the FX dramedy about a contentious family and a struggling restaurant at the center of the life of a talented chef, won best comedy series for its first season. It also made a meal of the comedy acting categories, with Jeremy Allen White winning best actor, Ayo Edebiri winning best supporting actress, and Ebon Moss-Bachrach taking best supporting actor. All three were first-time nominees. This is a show about family, and found family and real family, Edebiri said from the stage as she accepted the first trophy of the night at the Peacock Theater in Los Angeles. Instead of the usual producer speeches, Matty Matheson, a real-life elite chef who plays a kitchen newbie and repairman on The Bear, spoke for the show while surrounded by the cast near the end of the Fox telecast. I just love restaurants so much, the good and the bad, were broken inside, Matheson said before getting a long kiss on the mouth from Moss-Bachrach. Brunson won best actress in a comedy for the show she created, ABCs Abbott Elementary, becoming the first Black woman to win the award in more than 40 years and the first from a network show to win it in more than a decade. I am so happy to be able to live my dream and act out comedy, Brunson said during her acceptance, fighting back tears. The writer-actor was among the stars with standout looks on the Emmys silver carpet. Succession won six Emmys overall including best supporting actor in a drama for Matthew Macfadyen and best writing in a drama for show creator Jesse Armstrong. The only drama acting category it didnt win was supporting actress, taken for the second time by Jennifer Coolidge of The White Lotus. The Bear won in every category it was nominated for Monday night, and along with the four it had won previously at the Creative Arts Emmys, took 10 overall, the most of any show. LANDMARK WINS ON TVS BIG NIGHT Beef from Netflix won best limited series, while Yeun and Wong became the first Asian Americans to win in their categories  Yeun for best actor in a limited series and Wong for best actress. Creator Lee Sung won Emmys for writing and directing. It had eight Emmys overall after three wins at the Creative Arts Emmys. Brunson had won a writing Emmy for Abbott Elementary, her mockumentary about a predominantly Black and chronically underfunded grade school in Philadelphia, but this was her first for acting. Isabel Sanford of The Jeffersons was the only previous Black woman to win the category in 1981. The show held on the King holiday saw three Black women win major awards: Brunson, Edebiri and Niecy Nash-Betts, who won best supporting actress in a limited series for Dahmer  Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story. On the Netflix show, Nash-Betts played a neighbor of the serial killer whose complaints to authorities about his behavior go unheeded. I accept this award on behalf of every Black and brown woman who has gone unheard and over-policed, she said. Everybody having fun at the chocolate Emmys tonight? host Anthony Anderson said during the show. We are killing it tonight! ... This is like MLK Day and Juneteenth all rolled up in one! The tweaked awards calendar made for some oddities. Edebiri and White won their Emmys for the shows first season eight days after winning Golden Globes for the second season. BABY TALK AMID SUCCESSION WINS Culkin as little brother Roman Roy outshined the older brother and the father to win the last lead actor Emmy for Succession. He had twice been nominated for best supporting actor for Succession without a win. But in the final season, in which his character goes from sideline wisecracker to emotional disaster at the center of the shows drama, he was put in the lead category and won over his fictional father Brian Cox and brother Jeremy Strong. After praising his on-screen family, he shifted to his own family, getting big laughs during his speech when he told his wife Jazz Charton that their two young kids werent enough. I want more, he said. You said if I won, we could talk about it. Snook took her first Emmy in three nominations for Succession for playing the familys lone daughter Shiv Roy, and her show-husband Macfadyen won the second Emmy of his career for playing Tom Wambsgans, the son-in-law that began the HBO series as a hanger-on and ended it as the closest thing it had to a victor. MANY TEARS, AND ONE CONCERNED MOTHER Emotions ran high from the start of the ceremony. Edebiri and Brunson were both quick to cry as they took the stage, and the first presenter, Christina Applegate, who said in 2021 that she was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, got a standing ovation as she came out using a cane, helped by Anderson. As the tears welled in her eyes, she struggled to get through the nominees and winner. Anderson told the nominees at the beginning of the night that instead of having their speeches cut off by music, his mother, actor Doris Hancox, sitting in the audience, would tell them when it was time to move on. But she more often shouted down her son in the running gag. OLDER SHOWS RETURN TO SPOTLIGHT Honoring television history was the theme at the 75th Emmys. Anderson opened the show on a Mr. Rogers set and performed TV theme songs including Good Times, and several cast reunions were spread throughout the show. Cast members including Martin Lawrence and Tisha Campbell from Martin, Ted Danson and Rhea Perlman from Cheers, and Rob Reiner and Sally Struthers from All in The Family performed short bits from recreations of their sitcom sets before presenting awards. Tina Fey and Amy Poehler reunited to present in the form of their 2001-2005 Weekend Update team-up from Saturday Night Live. Weve reached the stage in life where well only present awards sitting down, Fey said. One notable appearance came from Katherine Heigl, who joined Ellen Pompeo and other former Greys Anatomy castmates on a hospital room set after leaving the show, now about to start its 20th season, on less than ideal terms in 2010. Yes, there have been changes over the years, Heigl said with a wry smile, But the one constant is the amazing fanbase. Source - Quad-City Times - Agencies",

        "content": "Mahinda Kodituwakku, the self-proclaimed Avalokiteshvara Bodhisattva, has been remanded until 24 January, on orders of the Colombo Fort Magistrates Court. Kodituwakku was arrested on 15 January, on charges of committing irreligious activities that are contrary to Buddhist teachings. On 12 January, the Colombo Fort Magistrates Court also imposed an overseas travel ban on him. Earlier this month, the president of Buddhist Information Centre, Ven. Agulugalle Sri Jinananda Thero had filed a complaint with the CID alleging that Kodituwakku has been misleading the Buddhist community. Alleging that Kodituwakku has been misleading the Buddhist community, Jinananda Thero claimed that he was directly involved with the recently deceased preacher named Ruwan Prasanna Gunaratna, who had promoted mass suicide through his distorted teachings and later died by suicide. Meanwhile, Ven. Balangoda Kassapa Thero, addressing a media briefing, claimed that this self-proclaimed Bodhisattva had sexually abused his own daughter before leaving his house while calling it Abinishkramanaya (Great Departure). Bodhisattvas are enlightened beings on the path to becoming Buddhas but postpone reaching nirvana to help humanity.",

        "title": "Anticipated Sri Lanka tourism app set to revitalize the islands tourism sector - report",
        "date": "January 16, 2024 03:11 pm",
        "content": "As the first quarter of 2024 beckons, Sri Lankas tourism sector is brimming with anticipation. The long-awaited launch of an all-inclusive Sri Lanka Tourism app is in its final stages, promising to significantly uplift the island nations tourism industry. The initiative, which earned Cabinet approval back in 2019, is finally gaining momentum after being stalled by COVID-19 and other unforeseen challenges. Reactivating the Sri Lanka Tourism App Priyantha Fernando, the Chairman of the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority, has confirmed the reactivation of the initiative. To finalize the apps scope and content, management and technical evaluation committees are being formed. The development will be undertaken by the same Malaysian developer who was initially involved. The apps launch, however, hinges on the progress of technical requirements and necessary clearances. If the development starts from scratch, the release could extend into the second quarter of 2024. But if all goes well, tourists could have access to this comprehensive digital tool as early as March 2024. What the App Entails The Sri Lanka Tourism app aims to provide comprehensive information on tourist sites, registered establishments, and service providers. It will enable tourists to purchase tickets for attractions and rate their experiences. Additional features include visa application processing and insights into tourists areas of interest. This data will aid in creating targeted tourism products. The app will support multiple languages, including English, German, French, Russian, and Chinese. This move is designed to cater to a wider audience and ensure ease of use for tourists from different linguistic backgrounds. Importantly, the apps development will not be a financial burden to the government due to a funding arrangement made with the developer in the prior Cabinet agreement. Other Developments in Sri Lankan Tourism Apart from the app, Sri Lankas Tourism Promotion Bureau is also addressing obstacles to marine tourism, particularly leisure activities on yachts. They have finalized classification criteria for marine tourism and are receiving assistance from the Asian Development Bank to address remaining issues. The goal is to attract wealthy Indian yacht owners to berth their vessels in marinas throughout the country. The government has also made plans to reduce taxes, introduce water sports, and implement plans for a boat service industry to boost growth in the domestic sector. Sri Lanka aims to attract 2.3 million tourists in 2024, focusing on tourists from India, Russia, China, the UK, and Germany. On another front, Sri Lanka has installed an AI-automated facial recognition system at Bandaranaike International Airport. This deployment aims to identify nefarious activities such as drug trafficking and ID fraud at international border crossings. This move, although controversial, is part of a crackdown by police and the Ministry of Public Security that saw over 25,000 arrests since December 17, 2023. Source: BNN Breaking --Agencies",

        "date": "January 16, 2024 04:36 pm",
        "content": "A five-member committee has been appointed to investigate into the recent incident of several inmates escaping the Kandakadu Treatment and Rehabilitation Centre following a clash that occurred among the detainees. The committee was appointed by Minister of Justice Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe. Accordingly, the relevant committee, headed by the Supreme Court Judge Hector Yapa, has been instructed to launch an investigation regarding the matter and provide necessary recommendations within a period of 03 weeks. The other members of the committee are as follows; 01. M.S.P. Sooriyapperuma Additional Secretary (Administration and Police), Ministry of Public Security 02. R.S. Hapugaswatta Additional Secretary (Administration) Ministry of Justice, Prison Affairs and Constitutional Reforms 03. Piyumanthi Peiris Senior Assistant Secretary (Legal), Ministry of Justice, Prison Affairs and Constitutional Reforms 04. D.M. Saman Dissanayake Additional Secretary, Ministry of Defence Meanwhile, the Office of the Commissioner General of Rehabilitation has also decided to carry out a special investigation into the individuals who are allegedly hindering the process of rehabilitation. The relevant officers mentioned that there is an invisible arm acting behind certain clashes that occur among the detainees of Kandakadu Treatment and Rehabilitation Centre. The large-scale drug traffickers are reportedly experiencing a shortage of heroin drugs within the coutry and also lack individuals for the transportation of drugs, as a result of the special police operations carried out across the island in order to crack down the drug networks. The drug addicts who are arrested during drug raids are usually referred to the rehabilitation centres including Kandakadu and Senapura treatment and rehabilitation centres. At certain instances, it has been observed that the detainees of the rehabilitation centres stage demonstrations over various demands and on some occasions, inmates have escaped from the rehabilitation centres during such instances. During the preliminary investigations carried out regarding the matter, it has been revealed that the large-scale drug traffickers are manipulating the inmates to create such tense situations within the rehabilitation centres. Against this backdrop, the Office of the Commissioner General of Rehabilitation has taken measures to initiate an extended investigation into all the inmates detained at the rehabilitation centres island-wide. The office also highlighted that once the relevant investigations are completed, legal action will be taken against the inmates found responsible for such incidents, after removing them from the relevant rehabilitation centres. Meanwhile, over 30 international human rights organizations including the Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and the International Commission of Jurists recently expressed their deep concern regarding the drastic intensification of anti-drug operations in Sri Lanka leading to significant human rights violations. Issuing a joint statement, the 33 international organizations demand the Sri Lankan government to stop the abusive anti-drug operation and release the arbitrarily detained individuals. Furthermore the statement highlighted that the use of violence to discipline and punish has been reported in at least two compulsory drug rehabilitation centres which are within the purview of the Bureau of the Commissioner General for Rehabilitation and are operated by the military, which is in itself a violation of international standards. They had also took into note the UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention in its statement at the conclusion of its visit to Sri Lanka 2017expressing concern regarding the involvement of military personnel in drug treatment and rehabilitation, the fact that strenuous physical exercise was the core component of compulsory drug treatment, and at the lack of trained professionals to monitor the health of people in detention. Through the statement, it was also demanded to immediately release persons arrested or sent to compulsory drug rehabilitation for using drugshaving a drug dependence, cease involving the armed forces in drug control and treatment activities as consistent with human rights law, repeal laws that allow compulsory drug rehabilitation, close compulsory treatment centres and release persons presently held at the centres within the purview of the Bureau of Commissioner General for Rehabilitation.",

        "title": "Opportune moment for investing in Sri Lankas renewable energy sector  President",
        "date": "January 16, 2024 05:17 pm",
        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe highlighted the present as an opportune moment for investing in Sri Lankas renewable energy sector, expressing confidence in its potential to yield substantial benefits for both stakeholders and consumers in the coming decades. The President also underscored that investors venturing into this sector can anticipate a comprehensive and unwavering policy framework in the realm of renewable energy. President Ranil Wickremesinghe made these remarks during his address at the Green Technology Forum convened on January 15 in Davos, Switzerland. The event was coordinated by the Swiss-Asian Chamber of Commerce. Speaking on the theme of Paving the way to an energy secure Sri Lanka, President Ranil Wickremesinghe highlighted the substantial potential of Sri Lankas renewable energy sector. He further outlined the governments initiatives over the past two years to establish an investment-friendly environment in the renewable energy sector. Emphasizing Sri Lankas dedication to addressing climate change, President Ranil Wickremesinghe elaborated on various measures, including the Tropical Belt Initiative, presented at the COP28 conference in Dubai. Highlighting Sri Lankas commitment to sustainable and green development, the President emphasized the nations ambitious plans and determination to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. President Ranil Wickremesinghe underscored the pivotal role of the rapid renewable energy plan, describing it as a key component of Sri Lankas comprehensive efforts towards sustainable development and a crucial step in ensuring energy security. Following is the full speech delivered by President Ranil Wickremesinghe at the Green Technology Forum in Davos, Switzerland. I thank the Swiss Asian Chamber of Commerce and their partners in organising this event for the invitation to speak today. BACKGROUND: GREEN ENERGY AND CLIMATE CONCERNS There is an urgent need for acceleration of global actions towards climate change mitigation. There have been multiple global forums which have resulted in numerous commitments towards this end. However, actions have fallen drastically short of commitments. The fallout of this failure in global leadership is borne largely by developing nations of the global south. When periods of drought extend beyond normal, undermining agricultural production, our food security is in jeopardy. When hydropower gets disrupted due to delayed monsoons, our energy security is in jeopardy. Droughts are often followed by a deluge, leading to flash floods and landslides, disrupting lives and livelihoods of under-privileged communities in particular. It is very evident that there is a disproportionate impact of the adverse outcomes of climate change on developing countries. This brings to light the issue of climate justice and the need for a stronger contribution from the advanced economies towards adaptation and mitigation efforts in the global south. That being said, Sri Lanka will forge ahead with its efforts towards climate mitigation. We have also recently launched the Tropical Belt Initiative at the COP28 in Dubai  this creates a framework for catalysing private investment in forests, energy, oceans, mangroves, in the countries of the tropical belt. Today I want to focus on one key aspect of such efforts, which is our drive towards renewable energy. RENEWABLE ENERGY IN SRI LANKA: BUILDING ON HISTORY In fact, Sri Lanka is a country with a long history of renewable energy. Since independence Sri Lanka developed an extensive network of hydropower, commissioning its first major hydro-power plant in 1950. Hydropower was able to provide for most of the countrys energy needs until the 1990s. Even today, hydropower accounts for around 40 of Sri Lankas installed electricity generation capacity. With hydropower largely exploited to the optimal levels, there has been an increased effort to include wind and solar power generation to the national grid. The government is now accelerating this process to ensure that by 2030, 70 of Sri Lankas electricity needs are fulfilled by renewable energy sources. To reach this target requires a large investment of up to USD 11.5 billion. However, until recently the framework for private investment in the renewable energy sector has not been very conducive. Over the last 2 years several measures have been taken by the government to correct these shortcomings and ensure an optimal investment climate for renewable energy is in place. FINANCIAL REFORM The first step was to ensure cost reflective pricing. Between 2014 and 2022 electricity tariffs had not been adjusted. This resulted in major cash flow problems for the Ceylon Electricity Board that sometimes led to payment delays to power suppliers. However, from August 2022 we have shifted to a cost-reflective pricing structure. Accordingly, electricity tariffs are revised every quarter to reflect costs on a forward looking basis. The CEB, which has long been a loss making entity, returned a profit in 2023, enabling it to settle significant levels of past debt along with some balance sheet structuring. The company now has a strong balance sheet, a far stronger cash flow position, and a pricing structure that ensures liquidity. Rigidities in the feeding tariff has also been a concern of past investors. However, this has also been addressed with greater flexibility being introduced to the tariff options, including choices between fixed tariff and variable tariff formulas. In addition to internal reform, we are also putting in place the framework to attract green financing. Sri Lanka has developed the Road Map for Sustainable Finance, Green Finance Taxonomy, the SDG Investor Map and the Green Bond Framework, that is currently under formulation, creates the enabling environment for Sri Lanka to have a robust engagement in climate finance. The availability of sustainable finance will be an added boost for renewable energy investments in Sri Lanka. LEGISLATIVE REFORM There have also been legislative barriers to large scale private investment in the renewable energy sector. Those legal hurdles have also been cleared through necessary amendments to the Electricity Act introduced in 2022. INSTITUTIONAL REFORM Thirdly, the government is in the final stages of implementing unbundling of the Ceylon Electricity Board. This will result in greater financial and operational autonomy for the distribution, generation, and transmission arms of the CEB, resulting in competition and transparency. Whilst private participation in generation is already available, the unbundling process will open up opportunities for private participation in distribution as well. This major reform, implemented with the support of the Asian Development Bank, will ensure the CEB operates at the frontier of efficiency, delivering the best outcome for consumers and the most competitive and efficient producers of electricity. The draft legislation for this reform was already been published last month. INFRASTUCTURE IMPROVEMENTS The ambition of 70 electricity from renewals also requires improved system efficiency and upgrades to integrate more renewable energy, particularly from 2026. Investments will be required in storage, transmission, and distribution, along with the ongoing private investments in generation. Plans for this integration up to 2030 are in place and have begun implementation. FUTURE OUTLOOK Following the major reforms implemented in the energy sector in the last 2 years, there has been renewed interest in this sector. There are already large scale solar and wind power projects that have commenced implementation. A major Indian player has commenced implementation of a 350MW wind power plant that is expected to be commissioned in 2025. The same player is considering a further USD 750 million investment in wind power. Wind power is a major opportunity for Sri Lanka. A recent World Bank report indicates that off-shore wind power in particular has the potential to generate power far greater than Sri Lankas requirements. Considering this, Sri Lanka and India are in advanced stages of talks regarding grid inter-connection to enable Sri Lanka to export surplus electricity particularly to the fast growing industrial belt in the Southern part of India. There is also tremendous potential for the development of green hydrogen in Sri Lanka. CONCLUSION Sri Lanka has ambitious plans to fulfil its sustainable, green development agenda. By 2050 the country has committed to achieving net zero. The accelerated renewable energy plan is a key component of this overall effort and is also an essential step on the path towards energy security. Renewable energy will also drive down costs of generation since at present Sri Lanka is compelled to rely on high cost heavy fuels during the dry season. Sri Lanka is in the process of establishing an international climate university, which will continue to unlock opportunities in green energy. It is clear that Sri Lankas renewable energy policy direction is underpinned by multiple motivations and drivers. Therefore investors can expect a high degree of policy continuity in this sector going forward as well. This is the best time to invest in Sri Lankas renewable energy journey, and I have no doubt such investments will generate significant value for shareholders and Sri Lankas consumers over the next several decades.",
