        "content": "Israeli authorities said 14 hostages being held in the Gaza Strip and 42 Palestinian prisoners would be released on the second day of a truce deal today. Prison authorities said 42 prisoners  both male and female  would be freed under the terms of the agreement, which mandates exchanges at a ratio of three to one, and an Israeli official source said 14 hostages would be handed over. On the first day of the four-day cease-fire, Hamas released 24 of the about 240 hostages taken during its October 7 attack on Israel. On the same day, Israel freed 39 Palestinians from prison. Those freed from captivity in Gaza were 13 Israelis, 10 Thai nationals and a Filipino. During the four days, Hamas is to release at least 50 Israeli hostages, and Israel 150 Palestinian prisoners. Israel has said the truce can be extended an extra day for every additional 10 hostages freed  something US President Joe Biden said he hoped would come to pass. The start of the truce on Friday morning brought the first quiet for 2.3 million Palestinians reeling and desperate from relentless Israeli bombardment that has killed thousands, driven three-quarters of the population from their homes, and levelled residential areas. Rocket fire from Gaza militants into Israel went silent as well. Source: Khaleej TimesAFP",

        "date": "November 25, 2023 04:37 pm",
        "content": "Sri Lanka will likely approve on Monday a proposal from Chinese state refiner Sinopec to build a 4.5-billion-dollar refinery, the South Asian island nations energy minister said on Saturday. Its on the agenda for Monday. Once the cabinet gives approval, we will invite them to sign the agreement, Power and Energy Minister Kanchana Wijesekera told Reuters. Sri Lanka, trying to recover from its worst economic crisis in more than 70 years, is hungry for new investment and local fuel supplies. Sinopecs investment of at least 4.5 billion will go up in value as and when they do additions, but they must first come and sign the agreement for us to give any more details, Wijesekera said. For Sinopec, the worlds top refinery by capacity and one of the largest petrochemical makers, the investment would mark a breakthrough in a long effort to expand beyond Chinas borders. It owns refinery assets in Saudi Arabia and petrochemicals production in Russia. The Sri Lanka investment follows state-run China Merchant Port Holdings 99-year lease at Hambantota port and a 392 million deal to build a logistics and storage hub in Colombo port, Chinese state media reported in April. That fits into Beijings ambitious Belt and Road Initiative, billed as recreating the ancient Silk Road to boost global trade infrastructure, experts say. Sinopec will start basic engineering design, including finalising the size of the refinery and technical configuration, after getting official approval, a senior company official told Reuters this month. The investment will add to Sinopecs recently started fuel retailing business, the third international company with a foothold in Sri Lanka, with a license to operates 150 petrol stations. In August Sinopec and commodities trader Vitol were shortlisted by the Sri Lankan government to bid for the refinery. Vitol subsequently dropped out, the Sinopec official said. The refinery may target markets beyond Sri Lanka, where local fuel consumption is low, and use its partnership with China Merchants Port to expand bunker fuel supply at Hambantota, a deep-sea port near busy shipping lanes between Europe and Asia, analysts say. Sinopecs fuel oil division, which runs the retail business there, began in 2019 supplying marine bunker fuel at Hambantota, another Sinopec official said. Sri Lankas refinery at Sapugaskanda, commissioned in 1969, can process 38,000 barrels of oil a day. Source: Reuters -Agencies",

On Friday, the court had reserved its order on the pronouncement of the quantum of sentence in the murder case. Trial judge Ravindra Kumar Pandey had reserved the verdict after detailed arguments. During the arguments, the public prosecutor told the court that apart from the convict Amit Shukla, the DLSA had given an unsatisfactory report of conduct in jail.

        "title": "CEBs potential Dec. profits to be passed on to consumers in April",
        "date": "November 25, 2023 10:33 pm",
        "content": "Minister of Power and Energy Kanchana Wijesekera, stated that in the event of the Electricity Board realizing any operating profit by December, attributed to the favourable rain conditions, a strategic decision has been made to allocate these gains to consumers in April. Furthermore, Minister Kanchana Wijesekera highlighted that the Electricity Board is currently facing a financial deficit of Rs. 12 billion. However, given the prevailing rain conditions, it is anticipated that there may be a positive turn in the financial outlook, as indicated in the upcoming financial report of the Electricity Board in December. Minister Wijesekera shared these insights during his participation in a Press Briefing held at the Presidential Media Centre (PMC) today (25 Nov), organized under the theme Collective Path to a Stable Country. The Minister further commented: The restructuring of the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) has long been a subject of discussion within the country. In a significant development, the Cabinet granted approval last Monday for the restructuring based on the submitted report. Additionally, the proposed new electricity bill received approval, marking a crucial step towards enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of the electricity sector in alignment with national objectives Consequently, measures are underway to officially gazette and submit the new Electricity Act to Parliament within the upcoming two weeks. The intention is to facilitate a comprehensive debate on the proposed Act in the Parliamentary sessions scheduled for January of the following year. The Minister addressed misconceptions raised in Parliament concerning the configuration of electricity generation, transmission and distribution. The Ministers proposal entails restructuring power generation into four distinct companies, emphasizing that the entire hydroelectricity sector, constituting 100, will remain under government control. The management of power plants situated in close proximity to Mahaweli, Lakshapana and Samanalaweva will also be retained by the government. As part of this restructuring initiative, it has been decided to consolidate the Norochchole power plant under a single company, while all other power plants will be grouped together under a separate entity. This strategic decision aims to optimize operational efficiency and enhance the overall effectiveness of the power generation sector. The proposal includes the establishment of a distinct company dedicated to transmission work, with the main control system remaining entirely under government ownership. Furthermore, it is suggested that the four distribution zones be transformed into four separate companies, each tasked with efficient and independent operation. This strategic proposal aims to streamline the transmission and distribution processes, ensuring enhanced effectiveness and responsiveness within the electricity sector. The restructuring of the electricity board is anticipated improvements in efficiency, quality and reduction of wastage. The initiative takes into consideration existing laws and regulations in various countries worldwide. The implementation of the restructuring plan is slated to follow the submission of the draft, incorporating feedback and suggestions from various stakeholders, including experts of the relevant field. The continuity of the Public Utilities Commission is expected to remain unchanged, operating in a manner consistent with current practices. Presently, the Electricity Board is experiencing a financial deficit of Rs. 12 billion. Regrettably, despite occurrence of rains, the Electricity Board has not yet achieved a financially profitable position. The current rain situation has yet to contribute to the desired positive impact on the boards financial standing. The board is closely monitoring the situation, and if operational profits are realized by December, as determined through financial calculations, a concession will be extended to consumers in April, aligning with the commitment to pass on benefits to the public contingent upon favourable financial outcomes. The nation has suffered the loss of numerous power plants as a consequence of delayed policy decisions and the prolonged non-implementation of previously made decisions. The proposed construction of the Sampur power plant, a project that has been under consideration for several years, faced a significant setback when the decision was made in 2016 to forego its construction. Originally slated for completion in 2020, the non-realization of the Sampur plant has resulted in an annual loss of Rs. 95 billion. As part of the governments strategic initiatives, five significant projects have been identified for immediate implementation. Additionally, there are plans to sign agreements for five more projects before the end of the current year. The forthcoming agreements include collaborations with the Adani wind power plant in Mannar, the construction of a solar panel power plant in Siambalanduwa, the Hambantota solar panel project, also projects proposed for Batticaloa and Punakari. Furthermore, the government has issued instructions to the relevant departments to reassess the fee for reconnection following a power cut. It is anticipated that the current reconnection fee, set at Rs. 3000, will be revised to a range between Rs. 1000 and Rs. 2000. This adjustment is aimed at ensuring a more reasonable and accessible reconnection process for consumers, aligning with the governments commitment to enhancing customer satisfaction and service affordability in the electricity sector.",

        "date": "November 26, 2023 11:16 am",
        "content": "Tens of thousands of people have taken part in protests across Italy, calling for an end to violence against women following the murder of a university student earlier this month. Giulia Cecchettin was allegedly killed by her ex-boyfriend days before she was due to graduate. Large crowds gathered in Milan and Naples, and there was gridlock in the centre of the capital, Rome. Italys president said the murder of women could not be tolerated. In a statement marking the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women, Sergio Mattarella said: Dramatic news stories have shaken the countrys conscience. A human society that aspires to be civilised cannot accept, cannot endure, this string of attacks on women and murders, he said, adding that violence against women was a failure of society. Data from the Italian interior ministry shows that 106 women have so far been killed in the country this year, 55 of them allegedly by a partner or ex-partner. The protests take place amid a backdrop of public anger and soul-searching over the murder of Ms Cecchettin, a 22-year-old biomedical engineering student who had been due to graduate from the University of Padua last week. A number of events were planned for the day, including processions, uns, walks, flash mobs, sit-ins, and even free gynaecological examinations to raise awareness of gender-based violence and patriarchy in Italy. Ms Cecchettins father, Gino Cecchettin, marked the day by addressing students at the University of Padua and unveiled a red bench on campus in memory of all victims of violence against women. Nothing will bring Giulia back, but I want many good initiatives to come out of her death, he said. Ms Cecchettin disappeared on 11 November when she and Filippo Turetta went to buy her graduation outfit. The couple disappeared, but CCTV footage emerged a few days later showing Mr Turetta, 22, beating his former partner in a car park close to her house in Vigonovo, near Venice - according to the investigating judge. Her body was found at the bottom of a ditch. Mr Turetta was arrested near Leipzig in Germany after police issued an international arrest warrant and launched a manhunt for him. He returned to Italy on Saturday afternoon, and has not been formally charged yet. According to the news site, Corriere del Veneto, he is being held in a prison in Verona, and a preliminary hearing has been set for Tuesday. Giorgia Meloni, Italys first female prime minister, has expressed outrage at the countrys long history of violence against women by partners and ex-partners. She has promised a new educational campaign in schools to combat what she says is Italys still-pervasive culture of misogynistic violence. Source - BBC - Agencies",

        "date": "November 26, 2023 06:56 pm",
        "content": "In a historic move to empower the agricultural sector and strengthen the export economy, President Ranil Wickremesinghe unveiled the Urumaya Freehold Deed Program during the first phase of the public awareness campaign for the 2024 budget proposal. The President emphasized that this program is a tribute to the farmers who have been the backbone of the nation for generations. President Wickremesinghe outlined the key objectives of the initiative, stating that the export economy would be significantly fortified by transforming every village into an enterprise village. He also revealed plans to establish agriculture modernization service centers, providing essential facilities to support the growth of the agricultural industry. Addressing the gathering in Nochchiyagama, Anuradhapura today (26 Nov.), the Head of State raised a pertinent question, questioning the allocation of freehold land for the Shangri-La Hotel while pondering why a similar privilege couldnt be extended to the hardworking farmers who have cultivated the land for generations. He emphasized the potential for generating foreign exchange through strategic land allocations, citing the example of providing land to the Shangri-La Hotel while underscoring the importance of modernizing the agriculture industry as a means to strengthen the export economy. A significant highlight of the program is the allocation of two billion rupees in the 2024 budget to provide Urumaya freehold deeds. President Wickremesinghe proposed a departure from the existing deed categories, such as Jaya Bhoomi, Saumya Bhoomi, Swarna Bhoomi, in favor of a unified freehold deed system, slated for implementation in 2024. In his address, President Wickremesinghe urged unity in working for the country, transcending political differences. Reflecting on the challenges faced upon assuming office, he highlighted the successful efforts to stabilize the countrys economic situation, steering it away from bankruptcy. The President announced plans to resume stalled development projects, emphasizing the importance of safeguarding cultural and historical sites like Malwathu Oya and Maha Viharaya in Anuradhapura. Additionally, a budget allocation of one and a half billion rupees for cricket development in rural schools was disclosed. The Governor of the North Central Province Maheepala Herath commended the President for his pivotal role in navigating Sri Lanka through legal and economic challenges. Describing the state of the law in the country as wild at one point, Governor Herath praised the Presidents acceptance of this challenge and emphasized the commendable efforts that led to the countrys economic recovery. The Governor highlighted the Presidents visit to Anuradhapura and the Urumaya program, which is expected to unconditionally grant land rights to farmers. This gesture is seen as a significant step in empowering the agricultural community. Governor Herath underscored the Presidents commitment to redirecting the nations economy and reclaiming Sri Lankas lost standing on the global stage, attributing these achievements to the Presidents political maturity. Minister of State for Finance Shehan Semasinghe revealed that the President has included a groundbreaking provision in this years budget, granting freehold land rights to all citizens. Despite facing challenges in incorporating this proposal in the 2023 budget due to prevailing circumstances in the country, the Presidents commitment to fulfilling the peoples need for land rights remained unwavering. Minister Semasinghe emphasized the Presidents proactive measures in addressing agricultural concerns, particularly the provision of essential fertilizers to farmers, ensuring that the entire requirement for yielding seasons has been met. The Presidents comprehensive program has not only established political stability but has also laid the foundation for social and economic stability in the country. He expressed satisfaction in resolving a fundamental issue faced by the people, as they can now enjoy land with the rightful ownership determined by the Presidents decisive actions. Member of Parliament Duminda Dissanayake expressed gratitude to President Ranil Wickremesinghe for his leadership and the implementation of the Urumaya program, which grants farmers the heritage of their great-grandfathers. Mr. Dissanayake commended the Presidents political maturity, highlighting the effectiveness of this years budget in demonstrating the Presidents thorough preparation. The MP praised the Presidents decision to allocate a ten-thousand-rupee allowance to public servants, provide freehold deeds to farmers, and grant tenants the rightful ownership of their houses. This, according to Mr. Dissanayake, underscores the Presidents commitment to addressing the needs of various segments of society and showcases his leadership acumen. Member of Parliament S.M. Chandrasena commended the President for the significant financial allocation to the Anuradhapura district in the latest budget announcement. Notably, funds have been designated for crucial projects such as the Malwatu Oya initiative and the Maha Viharaya. MP Chandrasena underscored the Presidents commitment to the agricultural community by highlighting the proposal in this years budget to grant freehold deeds to farmers. He emphasized that these measures, aimed at providing relief to a nation grappling with economic challenges, exemplify the Presidents political maturity and his dedication to addressing key issues faced by the country. The event witnessed the presence of prominent figures, including the Chairman of the Anuradhapura District Development Committee H. Nandasena, MP Uddika Premaratne, Former Chief Minister S. M. Ranjith, Former Minister P. Harrison, Attorney-at-law Mr. Kasthuri Anuradhanayake, and Land Commissioner General Mr. Bandula Jayasinghe.",

        "date": "November 26, 2023 08:03 pm",
        "content": "Minneapolis ex-police officer Derek Chauvin, convicted in the murder of George Floyd, is reported to be in a stable condition after he was stabbed at an Arizona prison. The citys police chief and Minnesotas attorney general confirmed the news. Chauvin, who is white, is serving multiple sentences for the black mans death, which triggered huge protests against police brutality and racism. A source told AP the 47-year-old was seriously injured by another inmate. The Bureau of Prisons confirmed in a statement that an inmate at a federal prison in the city of Tucson was stabbed at 12:30 local time (19:30 GMT) on Friday. The agency said employees contained the incident and life-saving measures were performed on the inmate, who was then taken to hospital. The name of the prisoner was not given. Nobody else is thought to have been injured. Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison, quoted by CNN, confirmed that Chauvin had been stabbed and said he was in a stable condition. I am sad to hear that Derek Chauvin was the target of violence, Mr Ellison told CNN, in a statement from his office. He was duly convicted of his crimes and, like any incarcerated individual, he should be able to serve his sentence without fear of retaliation or violence. The state attorney generals office had prosecuted Chauvin in the George Floyd case. News of Chauvins condition was confirmed by Minneapolis Police Chief Brian OHara, who told local TV station KSTP-TV that he received the update from federal law enforcement partners. Were thankful that hes in a stable condition, he said, adding anyone whos assaulted like this, regardless of what theyve been accused of, deserve to be safe and thats certainly not cause for any celebration. The news comes days after the Supreme Court rejected an appeal from Chauvin, in which it was argued that he had not received a fair trial for the killing of Mr Floyd - who died after the former officer knelt on his neck for more than nine minutes in 2020. The killing in Minneapolis - captured on a bystanders phone camera - sparked global outrage and a wave of demonstrations against racial injustice and police use of force. Chauvin was later found guilty of Mr Floyds murder and sentenced to 22 years in prison. He was given a further 20-year sentence in July 2022 for violating Mr Floyds civil rights.

        "date": "November 26, 2023 09:52 pm",
        "content": "Sierra Leones president declared a nationwide curfew Sunday after gunmen attacked the militarys main and largest barracks in the West African nations capital and then overran detention centers, including a major prison. The attack raised fears of a breakdown of order amid a surge of coups in the region. The detention centers, including the Pademba Road Prisons  holding more than 2,000 inmates  were attacked just as security forces fought to restore calm during sustained shootouts at the Wilberforce military barracks, according to Information Minister Chernor Bah. The prisons were overrun (and) some prisoners were abducted by the assailants while many others were released, Bah said. Security forces managed to push back the assailants to the outskirts of the city where fighting continues, he added. Sierra Leones President Julius Maada Bio earlier declared a nationwide curfew in response to the attacks. An Associated Press journalist in the capital said that gunshots were still heard in the city hours after the government assured residents of calm, although it wasnt clear who was behind the exchange of fire, nor if any arrests were made. The security forces are making progress in the operation to defeat and apprehend those responsible for todays attacks, Bah said. The government remains in control and on top of the situation. The president and the countrys Ministry of Information and Education also both said that the government and security forces are in control of the situation, trying to dismiss fears of a possible escalation of violence in the country whose population of 8 million people is among the poorest in the world, having some of the lowest scores on the U.N. Human Development Index. No details were immediately given about the gunmen or the reason for the attack, which comes months after Bio was reelected for a second term in a disputed vote in which the main opposition party accused the electoral commission of rigging the results. Videos posted online showed soldiers patrolling Freetowns empty streets and captured the loud blasts of gunshots at dawn. The AP couldnt immediately verify the authenticity of the videos. West Africas regional economic bloc ECOWAS  of which Sierra Leone is a member  described the incident as a plot to acquire arms and disturb the peace and constitutional order in the country. The bloc has in recent months tried to reverse the surge in coups in West and Central Africa, which has recorded eight military takeovers since 2020, the latest in Niger and Gabon this year. ECOWAS reiterates its zero tolerance for unconstitutional change of government, the bloc said in a statement. Bio was reelected in Sierra Leones fifth presidential election since the end of a brutal 11-year civil war  more than two decades ago  which left tens of thousands of people dead and destroyed the countrys economy. He continues to face criticism because of debilitating economic conditions. Nearly 60 of Sierra Leones population is facing poverty, with the youth unemployment rate being one of the highest in West Africa. Two months after Bio won the disputed vote, police said they arrested several people, including senior military officers planning to use protests to undermine peace in the country. A protest against the government in August last year resulted in the deaths of more than 30 people, including six police officers. Source - AP News - Agencies",

        "date": "November 27, 2023 12:10 pm",
        "content": "Sri Lankan cricketer Muttiah Muralitharan on Sunday said that just as in Palestine today, it was a hard time for Sri Lankans of all religions and races during the countrys long-running civil war. Recalling the 2009 terrorist attack on the Lankan cricket team in Pakistan, he said that the team knew how to react to the attack due to their exposure to such attacks back home. Muralitharan was at the 54th International Film Festival of India (Iffi) where a biographical Indian Tamil-language film on him 800 was screened. Muralitharan has been rated the greatest Test match bowler ever, holding the world record for the most wickets in both Tests and ODIs. He retired in 2010 after registering his 800th wicket in a Test. The cricketer, speaking during an in-conversation session at Iffi, said that, growing up, he was among the more vulnerable during the Lankan civil war being part of a minority community. I never felt it at that time, but it was a difficult time for Sri Lanka. It was not an easy journey. If you were a kid in those days in Sri Lanka, for any religion and for any race, it was a hard time for everyone, said Muralitharan. Now you see Palestine. Now we see it is exaggerated because of the media and something. But similar things happened. Sometimes bombs used to explode. It was a life of uncertainty. He said that the period of the civil war lasted through his growing up years until his career ended, impacting him throughout. That life was until I finished my career. War finished in 2009 and I retired in 2010. It was for all cricketers. I am a little special because I come from a minority community. I was more in focus than other cricketers. That was a difficult time. But now when I tell you the story it looks scary and everything, for me it was a way of life, Muralitharan said. He said that during the attack on the Lankan cricket team in Pakistan, they were sitting ducks waiting to be attacked due to the poor security provided to them. We were playing in Bangladesh and we were suddenly told that India is not going for security reasons because they got inside information that they may be attacked. We were told that is why we have to go. We asked a question at the time whether they are giving good security to us. They said they will give Presidential security, Muralitharan said. Always India, Pakistan, Bangladesh these countries are like our brothers so whenever something happens you fill in. It was the nature of the countries and the governments. So we went there because of that. However, it was later realised that the two security personnel provided to the team in the bus were without even guns, Muralitharan said. We heard some gunshots (on the bus on the way to the stadium). So we joked that this happens in Pakistan so we didnt care and we went around the roundabout near the stadium. Halfway through it started hitting the bus. Everyone said go down. We had gotten used to it during bombs. The bus stopped and the bullets were raining all over us, he said. The Sri Lankan team later learnt that they had escaped the attack with two rocket launchers and two grenades. They said they hit the bus with two rocket launchers, but both missed us. One hit the policemen in the vehicle ahead of us and they were all dying. They also threw two grenades, but both rolled over. The driver of our bus saved us, Muralitharan said. He said that when filmmaker Sripathy M approached him with the biographical movie project, he asked him to take it up only if he is ready to portray the true story despite the political and other pressures. Muralitharan, speaking about his cricketing days, also said that he has always maintained that Anil Kumble is a better bowler than him. He said that it is also tough today to break his record because fewer test matches are played now. Source - Times of India - Agencies",

Accordingly, the JMO was ordered to submit a report before the court in this regard, pertaining to his assessment as to whether or not the notorious criminal was actually unwell as claimed by the Superintendent of the Boossa Prison. The relevant order was issued by Colombo High Court Judge Adithya Patabendige after the Superintendent of the Boossa Prison informed the court via a fax, that the inmate will not be able to be present in court as a result of his health condition. The court was informed of the matter when a case filed against three persons including Gampola Vidanage Samantha Kumara alias Wele Suda, was taken up this morning.

        "content": "Pramodya Wickramasinghe, the chairman of Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) Selection Committee, arrived at the Special Investigation Unit (SIU) for Preventing Sports Offences, a short while ago (27 Nov.). Wickramasinghe was summoned before the SIU on 17 November, after Sports Minster Roshan Ranasinghe asked the SIU to investigate the formers recent statements pertaining to the plight of cricket in Sri Lanka. On 14 November, Wickramasinghe issued a controversial statement, alleging that the adversities Sri Lankan cricket is facing at present were the result of multifaceted conspiratorial plans that had been in operation at various levels over the past two and a half years. Expressing his views on the plight of the sport in the country, Wickramasinghe said the suspension imposed on Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) by the International Cricket Council (ICC) was also a consequence of this scheme. Behind this conspiracy, he said were certain individuals who were vying for power in the cricket governing body, brokers involved in match-fixing, and the players who were trying hard to secure their spot in the national team. The ultimate goal was to cause the downfall of the cricket administration. Wickramasinghe went on to dismiss the criticisms levelled against the national cricket selection committee over the past two and a half years, as untrue and destructive. In August, the Minister of Sports and Youth Affairs had appointed a Special Investigation Unit under the Prevention of Offences Relating to Sports Act, headed by Assistant Superintendent of Police W.A. Jayanath Wanasinghe. It had been established for the practical execution of the legal provisions of the Act, and proceed in line with the powers and functions assigned by the Prevention of Offences relating to Sports Act.",

        "content": "A bridegroom went on a shooting rampage, killing four people including the bride and seriously wounding a man before shooting himself dead with a pistol at his own wedding party on Saturday (Nov 25) night, police said. The shooter was identified as Chaturong Suksuk, a disabled former ranger and Paralympic athlete. The tragic incident ocacurred at about 11.25pm at a house in Wang Nam Khieo district, where a wedding party was being held for 29-year-old Chaturong, the bridegroom, and Kanchana Pachunthuek, 44, the bride. Wang Nam Khieo police were called to the scene for an investigation. On Saturday morning, a traditional wedding ceremony was held at the house between Chaturong and Kanchana, followed by a feast. Chaturong was a former paramilitary ranger with a disability in his leg caused by an incident that occurred while he was on duty. The two had lived together as a couple for three years before deciding to formally wed. Chaturong was 15 years younger than the bride. A wedding party was held that night, attended by guests and relatives of both sides. During the party, the guests and relatives noticed Chaturong did not look as happy as might have been expected. Late in the night, Chaturong abruptly went out of the party to his car. Shortly afterwards, he returned with a pistol and fired shots that killed the bride, her mother Kingthong Klajoho, 62, her younger sister Kornnipa Manato, 38, and a guest, Thong Nonkhunthod, 50. Another guest, Bamrung Chatherat, 28, was seriously injured. Chaturong then shot himself. He died instantly. Mr Bamrung, the wounded man, was admitted to Maharat Nakhon Ratchasima Hospital. Pol Col Roongjroj Tang-amnuay, the Wang Nam Khieo police chief, said 11 spent cartridges of 9mm ammunition were recovered from the scene of the shooting. He said Chaturong was a former marine soldier attached to the Sattahip naval base in Chon Buri. He became disabled after one of his legs was run over by a train and cut off in an accident. Chaturong was a member of the Thai team of disabled athletes taking part in the 11th Asean Para Games in Indonesia in 2022 and clinched a silver medal in swimming. He was also on the list of disabled athletes to compete in the World Abilitysport Games 2023 to be held on Dec 1-9 this year in Nakhon Ratchasima.

        "date": "November 27, 2023 03:23 pm",
        "content": "Six Sri Lankan colonial artefacts are slated to be returned to the island in December, the Embassy of the Kingdom of the Netherlands reported. Accordingly, six historical objects that are currently on display in the collection of the Rijksmuseum Amsterdam in the Netherlands, including the Lewkes cannon, a Golden Kasthane, a Silver Kasthane, a Sinhalese Knife and two Guns that were confirmed to belong to Sri Lanka, will be returned to the island in the first week of December, after over 200 years abroad. The Dutch Ambassador for International Cultural Cooperation Dewi van de Weerd will lead a mission overseeing the handover on behalf of the Netherlands. The artefacts will be physically returned to Sri Lanka during a two-day event at the Colombo National Museum on 05 and 06 December, which will be open to the public and will comprise activities to educate both, the young and old, on the long shared history of Sri Lanka and the Netherlands. Issuing a release in this regard, the Embassy said; With the restitution the Netherlands aim to strengthen the bilateral ties with Sri Lanka, while also coming to terms with its colonial past. As a part of this, Ambassador Van de Weerd hopes to discuss possibilities for further strengthening the cultural cooperation between the Netherlands and Sri Lanka. Governments, museums, universities and advisory committees in both countries are already working together to return more Sri Lankan cultural heritage in the future. Through these initiatives the government of the Netherlands aims to open a new chapter in its relationship with Sri Lanka. A chapter with more focus on justice, reconciliation and equality. The move comes after a high-level state cultural delegation of the Netherlands, led by State Secretary for Culture and Media in the Netherlands Gunay Uslu, signed two legal documents related to transferring the ownership of the artefacts in August this year. Accordingly, the Transference of Acknowledgement and the Loan Agreement were signed by Dutch State Secretary Gunay Uslu and Minister of Buddhasasana, Religious and Cultural Affairs Vidura Wickramanayaka and the Director General of the Department of National Museums on behalf of the Government of Sri Lanka, on 27 August.",

The SLPP parliamentarian said that he received a letter from President Ranil Wickremesinghe informing him that he has been removed from all his ministerial portfolios and positions with immediate effect. Delivering a special statement in Parliament this morning (27), Ranasinghe had claimed that his life at risk, and that in the event anything should happen to him, the President and his Chief of Presidential Staff will have to be held responsible. This is a new rift in politics, and my life may be lost in it. I could be killed anywhere, it could be tomorrow, today or the day after I dont know, but the President and Sagala Ratayake will have to be held responsible. Dont exclude these from the Hansard, the MP had said in Parliament. The former Sports Minister has been at loggerheads with Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) and its President Shammi Silva, ever since the national cricket teams humiliating loss to India at the ICC Cricket World Cup 2023 and subsequent exit from the tournament. Ranasinghe had appointed an interim committee after sacking the cricket governing body headed by Shammi Silva following the national teams disastrous World Cup campaign. Ranasinghe had appointed legendary captain Arjuna Ranatunga as the head of the seven-member interim committee. But the ICC then suspended SLC with immediate effect for government interference and Silva also managed to obtain a court order suspending the interim committee. The former Sports Minister had accused Silva and other board members of Sri Lanka Cricket for bidding for the ban from the ICC, calling it a big betrayal of the country. SLC had also recently slapped a defamation lawsuit against Ranasinghe for making damaging defamatory statements against it, deepening the administrative crisis in the country. The chaos in Sri Lankan cricket came after the national teams early exit from the World Cup. The Sri Lankans managed only two wins in nine games.",

        "date": "November 27, 2023 05:59 pm",
        "content": "It has been decided that the China Petroleum and Chemical Corporation (SINOPEC) will be awarded the contract to establish a new petroleum refinery and associated product processing centre in Hambantota, Minister of Power and Energy Kanchana Wijesekera revealed. Accordingly, the Cabinet approval was granted today (27 Nov.) to award the contract to SINOPEC to enter into an agreement to establish a new refinery and associated product processing centre in Hambantota. On 25 November, Wijesekera hinted that Sri Lanka will likely approve on Monday a proposal from Chinese state refiner Sinopec to build a 4.5-billion-dollar refinery. Its on the agenda for Monday. Once the cabinet gives approval, we will invite them to sign the agreement, , Wijesekera said. For Sinopec, the worlds top refinery by capacity and one of the largest petrochemical makers, the investment would mark a breakthrough in a long effort to expand beyond Chinas borders. It owns refinery assets in Saudi Arabia and petrochemicals production in Russia. The Sri Lanka investment follows state-run China Merchant Port Holdings 99-year lease at Hambantota port and a 392 million deal to build a logistics and storage hub in Colombo port, Chinese state media reported in April. That fits into Beijings ambitious Belt and Road Initiative, billed as recreating the ancient Silk Road to boost global trade infrastructure, experts say. Sinopec will start basic engineering design, including finalising the size of the refinery and technical configuration, after getting official approval, a senior company official told Reuters this month. The investment will add to Sinopecs recently started fuel retailing business, the third international company with a foothold in Sri Lanka, with a license to operates 150 petrol stations. In August Sinopec and commodities trader Vitol were shortlisted by the Sri Lankan government to bid for the refinery. Vitol subsequently dropped out, the Sinopec official said. The refinery may target markets beyond Sri Lanka, where local fuel consumption is low, and use its partnership with China Merchants Port to expand bunker fuel supply at Hambantota, a deep-sea port near busy shipping lanes between Europe and Asia, analysts say. Sinopecs fuel oil division, which runs the retail business there, began in 2019 supplying marine bunker fuel at Hambantota, another Sinopec official said. Sri Lankas refinery at Sapugaskanda, commissioned in 1969, can process 38,000 barrels of oil a day. - With input from agencies",

        "date": "November 27, 2023 06:04 pm",
        "content": "Irish author Paul Lynch won the 2023 Booker Prize for fiction on Sunday for his novel Prophet Song, a dystopian work about an Ireland that descends into tyranny. The 46-year-old pipped five other shortlisted novelists to the prestigious award at a ceremony in London. He becomes the fifth Irish writer to win the high-profile literary prize, which has propelled to fame countless household names, including past winners Salman Rushdie, Margaret Atwood and Hilary Mantel. This was not an easy book to write, Lynch said after collecting his award, which comes with 50,000 (around 63,000) and a huge boost to his profile. The rational part of me believed I was dooming my career by writing this novel. Though I had to write the book anyway. We do not have a choice in such matters, he added. Lynchs book is set in Dublin in a near future version of Ireland. It follows the struggles of a mother of four as she tries to save her family from totalitarianism. There are no paragraph breaks in the novel, which is Lynchs fifth. Canadian novelist Esi Edugyan, who chaired the five-person judging panel, called the story a triumph of emotional storytelling, bracing and brave. With great vividness, Prophet Song captures the social and political anxieties of our current moment, she said. Readers will find it soul-shattering and true, and will not soon forget its warnings. The Booker is open to works of fiction by writers of any nationality, written in English and published in the UK or Ireland between October 1, 2022, and September 30, 2023. None of this years six finalists -- which included two Americans, a Canadian, a Kenyan and another Irish author -- had been shortlisted before and only one had previously been longlisted. The shortlisted novels, announced in September, were chosen from a 13-strong longlist that had been whittled down from an initial 158 works. Among them was Irish author Paul Murrays The Bee Sting, a tragicomic saga which looks at the role of fate in the travails of one family. Murray was previously longlisted in 2010. Kenyan writer Chetna Maroos moving debut novel Western Lane about grief and sisterhood follows the story of a teenage girl for whom squash is life. The judges also selected If I Survive You by US writer Jonathan Escoffery, which follows a Jamaican family and their chaotic new life in Miami. He was joined by fellow American author, Paul Harding, whose This Other Eden -- inspired by historical events -- tells the story of Apple Island, an enclave off the US coast where societys misfits flock and build a new home. Canada was represented on the shortlist in the shape of Study for Obedience by Sarah Bernstein. The unsettling novel explores the themes of prejudice and guilt through a suspicious narrator. The Booker was first awarded in 1969. Last years winner was Sri Lankan writer Shehan Karunatilaka for The Seven Moons of Maali Almeida The previous Irish winners are Iris Murdoch, John Banville, Roddy Doyle and Anne Enright.

        "date": "November 27, 2023 07:10 pm",
        "content": "Police have arrested a suspect in the shooting of three young men of Palestinian descent who were attending a Thanksgiving holiday gathering near the University of Vermont campus Saturday evening. Agents from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives arrested Jason J. Eaton, 48, while conducting a search of the shooting area in Burlington at 3:38 p.m. Sunday, the Burlington Police Department said in a statement. Authorities collected evidence during a search of Eatons apartment in a building in front of the shooting location. He is scheduled to be arraigned Monday, police said. Online court records did not list an attorney who could speak on Eatons behalf. The attack that injured the three men around 6:25 p.m. Saturday may have been a hate crime, authorities previously said. Two of the men were in stable condition and the other suffered much more serious injuries, Burlington Police Chief Jon Murad said in a statement Sunday. The three, all age 20, were walking during a visit to the home of one of the victims relatives when they were confronted by a white man with a handgun, police said. Without speaking, he discharged at least four rounds from the pistol and is believed to have fled, Murad said. All three victims were struck, two in their torsos and one in the lower extremities. The victims are all of Palestinian descent. Two are U.S. citizens and the third is in the country with legal permission. Two of the men were wearing the black-and-white Palestinian keffiyeh scarves, Murad said. Burlington Mayor Miro Weinberger is expected to join Murad at a press conference Monday to discuss the investigation. Murad, who expressed sympathies for the victims and their families, said there is no additional information to suggest a motive. In this charged moment, no one can look at this incident and not suspect that it may have been a hate-motivated crime. And I have already been in touch with federal investigatory and prosecutorial partners to prepare for that if its proven, he said. The fact is that we dont yet know as much as we want to right now, Murad added. But I urge the public to avoid making conclusions based on statements from uninvolved parties who know even less. The American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee released a statement Sunday saying that the victims were Palestinian American college students and that there is reason to believe this shooting occurred because the victims are Arab. A man shouted and harassed the victims, who were conversing in Arabic, then proceeded to shoot them, the committees statement said. The FBI in Albany, New York, posted a statement late Sunday on X, formerly Twitter, saying the bureau is actively investigating the shooting with the Burlington Police Department, the ATF and other federal, state and local agencies. The White House said President Joe Biden was briefed on the shooting and would continue to receive law enforcement updates. The Council on American-Islamic Relations released a statement offering a 10,000 reward for information leading to an arrest or conviction of the person or people responsible for the shootings. The Institute for Middle East Understanding posted a statement on X that the institute said was from the victims families. We are extremely concerned about the safety and well-being of our children, the statement said. We call on law enforcement to conduct a thorough investigation, including tating this as a hate crime. We will not be comfortable until the shooter is brought to justice. Ramallah Friends School posted a statement on Facebook saying the three young men were graduates of the private school, in the West Bank. While we are relieved to know that they are alive, we remain uncertain about their condition and hold them in the light, the school said. We stand united in hope and support for their well-being during this challenging time. In response to the shooting, U.S. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries encouraged people to unequivocally denounce the startling rise of anti-Arab hate and Islamophobia in America. No one should ever be targeted for their ethnicity or religious affiliation in our country, the New York Democrat said in the statement posted on X. We will not let hatred win. Sen. Bernie Sanders, the Vermont Independent, also denounced the shooting. It is shocking and deeply upsetting that three young Palestinians were shot here in Burlington, VT. Hate has no place here, or anywhere. I look forward to a full investigation, Sanders said in a statement. Gov. Phil Scott called the shooting a tragedy, calling on the states residents to unite and not let this incident incite more hate or divisiveness. The Vermont-New Hampshire chapter of Jewish Voice For Peace, which has urged an end to the Israel-Hamas war, released a statement saying it was appalled by the shooting. We are in solidarity with the students, their families and all those affected by this clear act of hate, the organization said Sunday. We are in solidarity with all Palestinian people in occupied Palestine, around the world, and here in Vermont  and we are committed to creating a Vermont that is safe and welcoming for all. The American Jewish Committee, an advocacy organization for Jewish people worldwide, also said via X it was horrified by the attack and urged law enforcement to investigate this act as a possible hate crime. Last month, an Illinois landlord was charged with a hate crime after being accused of fatally stabbing a 6-year-old Muslim boy and seriously wounding his mother in Chicago. Police and relatives said he singled out the victims because of their faith. Demonstrations have been widespread and tensions in the U.S. have escalated as the death toll rises in the Israel-Hamas war. A fragile cease-fire between Israel and Hamas was back on track Sunday as the militants freed more hostages and Israel released 39 Palestinian prisoners. It was the third exchange under a four-day truce deal. Source - AP News - Agencies",

        "date": "November 27, 2023 07:30 pm",
        "content": "Minister of Water Supply and Estate Infrastructure Development Jeevan Thondaman has emphasised the need for a formula that sustains the water board while maintaining fairness for the general public. Speaking about the ongoing discussions pertaining to the introduction of a water tariff, the Minister pointed out that with the major domestic category comprising 75 and Samurdhi at 1.58, the government aims to prioritize these sectors over industries, albeit without pressuring them. Thondaman made these remarks while addressing a media briefing held at the Presidential Media Centre (PMC) today (27 Nov.). Minister Thondaman said discussions are still in progress, considering two parallel formulasone focused on cost recovery and the other on cost reflection. The final draft of the tariff formula is expected in December, with a commitment to avoiding unnecessary burden on the public. There is a possibility of an increased tariff rate for commercial institutions, with an emphasis on ensuring fair rates for charitable institutions, hospitals and schools. To further deliberate on these crucial decisions, a meeting has also been requested with Ministers Dilum Amunugama and Shehan Semasinghe, the outcome of which will be later divulged, while also leading to a vote on the proposed tariff. Minister Thondaman acknowledged the economic crisis affecting both foreign-funded and domestic-funded projects. He assured the public that new projects would kick-start in January, with a focus on completing existing projects. The government plans to engage in public-private partnerships to enhance water quality and reduce costs. The Minister clarified that while projects would involve private participation, there is no intention to sell or privatize water. The Minister acknowledged operational losses, citing increased electricity prices and existing debt as contributing factors. However, he highlighted a silver liningthe reduction in water usage due to conservation efforts following a tariff hike. The Minister stressed the importance of a sustainable tariff formula that considers debt servicing and CAPEX (Capital Expenditure) but does not overburden the public. Minister Thondaman discussed the governments commitment to efficient water conservation, especially in areas with inadequate access to clean water. Plans for a desalination plant in Jaffna and efforts to prioritize water supply from villages and estates were highlighted. The Minister also emphasized the streamlining of the water resources management policy to implement a comprehensive water management plan. The Minister refuted accusations of politicization within the Water Board and clarified the appointment process for key positions.

        "title": "Israel-Hamas truce in Gaza extended by two days, says Qatar",
        "date": "November 27, 2023 10:06 pm",
        "content": "A humanitarian pause in fighting between Israel and Hamas will extend by two days, mediator Qatar said Monday as an initial four-day truce in Gaza was set to expire. The State of Qatar announces that, as part of the ongoing mediation, an agreement has been reached to extend the humanitarian truce for an additional two days in the Gaza Strip, Qatari foreign ministry spokesman Majed Al Ansari said on X, formerly Twitter. Hamas confirmed Monday the truce in Gaza has been extended by two days. Hamas had said it was drawing up a new list of hostages held in the Gaza Strip in order to extend the truce with Israel. The statement from Osama Hamdan, a senior Hamas official, came as discussions were continuing on an extension of the initial four-day pause in the fighting and exchanges of hostages for Palestinian prisoners. Israel said Monday it was open to extending a truce with Hamas if the Palestinian group continues to release hostages, as international pressure mounted for a longer pause in the Gaza fighting. If no extension had been agreed to, the temporary truce was due to expire at 7 a.m. (12 a.m. EST) on Tuesday, threatening a return to intense fighting in a war that has already left many thousands dead. U.S. President Joe Biden, top EU envoy Josep Borrell and NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg had all joined a global chorus urging the parties to extend their temporary break in fighting. Israel had put Hamas on notice that an option for an extension of the truce was open in order to bring home 50 more Israeli hostages in the coming days, government spokesman Eylon Levy told reporters, potentially implying a five-day extension. As part of the truce deal, Hamas has so far released 39 Israeli hostages, including a 4-year-old girl orphaned by the groups Oct. 7 attack, with more expected later Monday. Israel has freed 117 Palestinian prisoners in exchange under the terms of the agreement. A further 19 foreign nationals have also been released from Gaza under separate arrangements. Tearful reunions of families and hostages, released in exchange for dozens of Palestinian prisoners, have brought the first relief from images of civilian death and suffering in the seven-week war, with hopes high for an extension. Thats our goal, to keep this pause going beyond tomorrow so that we can continue to see more hostages come out and surge more humanitarian relief into those in need in Gaza, Biden said Sunday, calling for operations to remove Hamas to be paused for as long as prisoners keep coming out. The EUs foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, echoed this call as the truce entered its final 24 hours, saying: The pause should be extended to make it sustainable and long lasting while working for a political solution. Nothing can justify the indiscriminate brutality Hamas unleashed against civilians, he said. But one horror cannot justify another horror. NATO chief Stoltenberg also weighed in, ahead of a meeting of allied foreign ministers in Brussels. I call for an extension of the pause. This would allow for much needed relief to the people of Gaza and the release of more hostages, he told journalists. Hamas had signaled its willingness to extend the truce, with a source telling AFP the group told mediators they were open to prolonging it by two to four days. The resistance believes it is possible to ensure the release of 20 to 40 Israeli prisoners in that time, the source close to the movement said. Under the truce, 50 hostages held by the militants were to be freed over four days in exchange for 150 Palestinian prisoners. A built-in mechanism extends the truce if at least 10 Israeli captives are released each extra day. But some hostages are believed to be held by Palestinian militant groups other than Hamas, potentially complicating future releases. Israel is also facing pressure from the families of hostages to extend the truce to secure more releases. Three successive days of hostage releases have buoyed spirits in Israel, with tearful reunions weeks after Hamas militants poured across the border on Oct. 7, killing 1,200 people, mostly civilians, according to Israeli officials. In response, Israel launched a military campaign to destroy Hamas, killing nearly 15,000 people, mostly civilians and including thousands of children, according to Gazas Hamas government. The third group of hostages released Sunday included a 4-year-old American citizen called Abigail whose parents were both killed in the Hamas attacks. What a joy to see her with us. But on the other hand, what a pity that she returns to the reality of not having parents, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said. She has no parents, but she has a whole nation that embraces her, he added. Also among those freed Sunday was an 84-year-old woman who was rushed to intensive care in critical condition after serious neglect, medical officials said. Separately, an Israeli soldier rescued from the Gaza Strip welcomed the releases of her fellow hostages, in her first public comments since she was freed. Ori Megidish, 19, was operating an observation post on the Gaza border when she was seized in the Hamas attacks. Her rescue was confirmed by the Israeli military just over three weeks later, but no details have since been released. In a relaxed video filmed at her home and posted to her TikTok account, she said she was fine and happy to see all the moving clips of hostages returning to their families. Israel had faced mounting pressure to extend the pause mediated by Qatar, the United States and Egypt, though its leaders have dismissed any suggestions of a lasting halt to the offensive. We continue until the end  until victory, Netanyahu said in Gaza on Sunday, on the first visit by an Israeli premier since 2005. His office has proposed a war budget of 30 billion shekels (8 billion) for 90 days. Wearing military fatigues and surrounded by soldiers, Netanyahu vowed to free all the hostages and eliminate Hamas, in footage posted online by his office. In another sign of mounting international concern, U.N. rights experts called Monday for independent investigations into alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity carried out in Israel and the Palestinian territories since Oct. 7. Morris Tidball-Binz, the United Nations special rapporteur on extrajudicial executions, and Alice Jill Edwards, the special rapporteur on torture, issued a joint statement stressing the need for prompt, transparent and independent investigations.

In a statement, it mentioned that the matter was discussed when the said committee met in Parliament on 22 November 2023 under the chairmanship of MP Sarath Weerasekera. The members of the committee pointed out that the public is facing some oppressive situations due to some people who are escorted by private security guards. The senior police officers said that legally the police cannot intervene in the personal security of a person. However, the committee pointed out that since the personnel of those private security services use weapons, certain regulation is necessary. The Committee decided to inform the Ministry of Defense to prepare criteria for regulating private security services, it said. There was also a lengthy discussion in the committee about the growth of underworld activities. It was also revealed in the committee that certain persons in the service of the armed forces show an increase in resorting to committing crimes. The Inspector General of Police pointed out that there is some weakness in the identification of criminals.

Drug control was also discussed at length in the committee. The police officials pointed out that the drug traffickers are working to make the school children addicted to drugs by giving them the pills.

        "date": "November 28, 2023 12:08 pm",
        "content": "The Court of Appeal has decided to take up further consideration of the case filed against the Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) interim committee on Tuesday (Dec. 05). Accordingly, the court has informed newly-appointed Minister of Sports Harin Fernando to present his status regarding the matter on that day, Ada Derana reporter said. On 06 November, a seven-member Interim Committee was appointed by then Sports Minister Roshan Ranasinghe, chaired by World Cup-winning former Sri Lanka captain Arjuna Ranatunga. It consisted of S. I. Imam, Retired Supreme Court Judge; Rohini Marasinghe, Retired Supreme Court Judge; Irangani Perera, Retired High Court Judge; Arjuna Ranatunga (Chairman); Upali Dharmadasa; Rakitha Rajapakshe, Attorney-at-Law; and Hisham Jamaldeen. The following day, the Appeals Court issued a 14-day stay order on the Interim Committee. The relevant order was issued by a two-member judge bench consisting of Appeals Court President Nissanka Bandula Karunaratne and Justice Vikum Kaluarachchi, upon consideration of the writ application filed by the SLC President challenging the Sports Ministers move. Later, on 13 November, Minister Ranasinghe filed a motion requesting the lifting of the stay order. Nevertheless, on Monday, President Ranil Wickremesinghe removed SLPP parliamentarian Ranasinghe from all his ministerial portfolios and positions with immediate effect including as the Minister of Sports and Youth Affairs and Minister of Irrigation. Subsequently, Harin Fernando, currently serving as the Minister of Tourism, was sworn in as the new Minister of Sports, while Minister Pavithra Wanniarachchi, currently serving as the Minister of Wildlife and Forest Resources Conservation, was sworn in as the Minister of Irrigation. Speaking to the media after taking oath as the new Minister of Sports, Fernando assured that necessary legal measures will be initiated to clean up the game of cricket in the country. He also stated that he would invite everyone to work together to help achieve this. The former Sports Minister has been at loggerheads with Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) and its President Shammi Silva, ever since the national cricket teams humiliating loss to India at the ICC Cricket World Cup 2023 and subsequent exit from the tournament.",

        "content": "WhatsApp, Metas instant messaging platform, with more than 2 billion users worldwide, is testing a new feature that shows a contacts profile information in the chat window. First spotted by WABetaInfo, the newest version of WhatsApp beta (v2.23.25.11) for Android now shows the status and last seen (if enabled) under the contact name in the apps chat window. As can be seen in the screenshot, users will see the other persons status under their name if they are offline and alternatively switch between their last seen if they have enabled the functionality. However, the information will only be shown if enabled in WhatsApps privacy settings. The ability to quickly check a users status from the conversation window is really handy since you will no longer have to tap and open the profile information screen and enable them to see if they have changed their status. The publication also suggests that users have been sharing their feedback and have requested a similar functionality in the last couple of years. The new feature will be available to everyone in a future version of WhatsApp for Android. However, it is still unclear if the developers are working on a similar functionality for iOS devices. In the last few months, WhatsApp has been working on several new features like ta shortcut button that lets you quickly access a ChatGPT-like AI-powered chatbot, new voice chats for group conversations, email verification for Android and iOS and more.

The men, low-wage workers from Indias poorest states, have been stuck in the 4.5 km (3 mile) tunnel in Uttarakhand state since it collapsed on Nov. 12. The process of pulling them out, one at a time on wheeled stretchers through a pipe 90 cm (3 feet) wide, would take a couple of hours, officials said. The evacuation pipe has to be pushed through and debris cleared before rescue workers can crawl through and begin getting the men out, they said. Dozens of rescue workers with ropes and ladders were lined up outside the tunnel and ambulances began arriving to take the 41 men to a hospital about 30 km away. The tunnel is part of the 1.5 billion Char Dham highway, one of Prime Minister Narendra Modis most ambitious projects, aimed at connecting four Hindu pilgrimage sites through an 890- km network of roads.

        "date": "November 28, 2023 05:15 pm",
        "content": "Elon Musk, whos been under fire for endorsing an antisemitic conspiracy theory and wider accusations of hatred flourishing on his social media platform X, visited Israel, where he toured a kibbutz attacked by Hamas militants and held talks with top leaders. The billionaire met with Israeli President Isaac Herzog, who scolded him over content on the platform previously known as Twitter, and joined Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for a tour of the Kfar Azza kibbutz, a rural village that Hamas militants stormed on Oct. 7 in a deadly assault that launched the war. Wearing a protective vest and escorted by a phalanx of security personnel as rain fell, Musk used his phone to take photos or videos of the devastation, according to video released by Netanyahus office. Musks visit came as Israel and Hamas reached a deal to extend a cease-fire for two more days. The Tesla CEO and prime minister visited the damaged homes of victims, including the family of Abigail Edan, a 4-year-old girl with dual Israeli-U.S. citizenship who was held hostage by Hamas after her parents were killed. She was released Sunday in the latest round of exchanges during a cease-fire in Gaza set to expire after Monday. It was jarring to see the scene of the massacre, Musk said in a conversation with Netanyahu streamed on X. He said he was troubled by video and photos that the prime minister showed him of the killings of civilians, including children. They spoke broadly about the conflict, the protests it has generated, the Middle East and more but did not touch on antisemitism online. Netanyahu, who urged a rollback of such hatred in a September meeting with Musk, said he hoped the billionaire would be involved in building a better future. Musk replied, Id love to help. Herzog did confront Musk, saying that the platforms you lead, unfortunately, have a huge reservoir of hatred, hatred of Jews and antisemitism. The Israeli president was joined in the meeting by some of the families of hostages held by Hamas in Gaza, according to a statement from Herzogs office. Hatred of the Jews affects the behavior of people in many places around the world, and you have a huge role to play in this, Herzog told Musk. The X owner responded that it had been a difficult day emotionally following the tour and that we have to do whatever is necessary to stop the hate, according to Herzogs office. Referring to Hamas militants, Musk said, Its amazing what humans can do if theyre fed lies since they were children. They will think that murdering innocents is a good thing, which shows how much propaganda can affect peoples minds. Musk has faced accusations from the Anti-Defamation League, a prominent Jewish civil rights organization, and others of tolerating antisemitic messages on the platform since purchasing it last year. The content on X has gained increased scrutiny since the war between Israel and Hamas began in October. A slew of big brands, including Disney and IBM, decided this month to stop advertising on the platform after a report by liberal advocacy group Media Matters said ads were appearing alongside pro-Nazi content and white nationalist posts. The same week, Musk responded on X to a user who accused Jews of hating white people and professing indifference to antisemitism by posting, You have said the actual truth. He has faced outcry, including from the White House. The billionaire, who has described himself as a free-speech absolutist, tweeted during his Israel visit that actions speak louder than words. X has since sued Media Matters, saying the Washington-based nonprofit manufactured the report to drive advertisers from the platform and destroy X Corp. Israeli government spokesperson Eylon Levy declined to say whether Musk was invited to the country or came on his own. X, formerly known as Twitter, did not respond to a request for comment. Israel also settled a spat with Musk over his Starlink satellite internet company, with Starlink agreeing to operate in Gaza only with government approval. As a result of this significant agreement, Starlink satellite units can only be operated in Israel with the approval of the Israeli Ministry of Communications, including the Gaza Strip, Communications Minister Shlomo Karhi tweeted. The two had tangled online previously after Musk promised that Starlink would support connectivity to internationally recognized aid groups in Gaza, drawing a rebuke from Karhi, who said Israeli would fight it because Hamas would use the service for militant activities.

        "content": "Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) MP Wimal Weerawansa has warned that the downfall of the current government has commenced. Speaking in Parliament on Tuesday (28 Nov.), Weerawansa alleged that the Presidents decision to remove Roshan Ranasinghe from his ministerial portfolios was a testament to Ranil Wickremesinghes true character, and further accused the Head of State of siding with thieves. The current President had the crown Presidency fall on to his head thanks to the Aragalaya, but yesterday, he showed his true character very clearly. He sacked the Minister who spoke against corruption, and stood with those who are corrupt, Weerawansa charged. The parliamentarian further recalled how during former President Gotabaya Rajapaksas tenure, when both he and MP Udaya Gamanpila were similarly sacked from their ministerial portfolios, and claimed that this marked the beginning of the end of Rajapaksas presidency. Drawing similarities between the two incidents, Weerawansa further alleged that Ranasinghes sacking clearly showed whose side the President is on, and that thereby this marked the beginning of the end of Wickremesinghes presidency as well. Mark my words, Ranil Wickremesinghe will not contest a presidential election. I pity anyone who thinks he will. I think he would much rather take up a high post at an international organisation He is not thinking of the future of this country. There will be no justice for this country during his short stint. He will only seek for his personal gain during his tenure.",

The President emphasized the need for innovative thinking and collaboration within the industry to ensure sustainable growth, the PMD reported. When I took over the government, I realized that sustainability alone is not sufficient. How are we going to earn foreign exchange? How are we going to have a positive balance of trade? In that, there were many suggestions. But what is the low-hanging fruit? And one of the low-hanging fruits was tourism. Lets promote tourism fully, President Wickremesinghe declared. The President acknowledged the need to move beyond the existing framework and embrace competition to elevate Sri Lankas standing in the global tourism market. Drawing parallels with countries like Vietnam, he questioned why they had more tourists despite being in the industry for a shorter period. President Wickremesinghe stressed the importance of increasing the number of tourists to 2.5 million in the upcoming year and subsequently expanding on this figure. Central to the Presidents vision is the enhancement of the tourism product. He urged the industry to specialize, tapping into the unexplored potential that Sri Lanka possesses. Referencing historical practices during the Anuradhapura period, he highlighted the early roots of tourism in Sri Lanka and encouraged a nuanced approach to promotion. Look at our food. From one area to another. Have you utilized it? Lets do that. We have to be special in many ways. You remember, tourism was not something that was new to us. It was there even in the time of the Anuradhapura period, President Wickremesinghe remarked. Acknowledging the role of hospitality in attracting and retaining tourists, the President emphasized the need for a comprehensive experience  encompassing accommodation, cuisine, and cultural offerings. He proposed the diversification and improvement of Sri Lankan cuisine, advocating for a fusion of local and international flavours to cater to diverse tastes. The President highlighted the potential for collaboration with expatriates to enhance the industry further. Drawing attention to the success of boutique hotels initiated around 2003-2004, he underscored the significance of niche markets, citing golf tourism as an example. The development of tourism infrastructure beyond traditional attractions was a key aspect of President Wickremesinghes address. He outlined plans for the transformation of Colombo into an entertainment hub, emphasizing the need for diverse activities to keep visitors engaged. What do we do there? Very little. You go to a museum, its a short run. You go to Gangaramaya Temple. You look at the Independence Square and back. So what are we planning? It should be an area of entertainment or music or food. All the way up to the Independence Square, it will be a new area, he explained. The President disclosed plans for the development of the Bogambara prison in Kandy into a hotel and a hotel school, showcasing the governments commitment to utilizing available resources for tourism. He urged stakeholders to contribute ideas and support to implement these transformative initiatives. Addressing the issue of minimum rates, President Wickremesinghe advocated for a shift towards higher rates, emphasizing the need for a quality product that justifies the cost. He encouraged the industry to think beyond conventional constraints and embrace a new mindset for achieving the ambitious target of 5 million tourists. In this new era, we need new thinking. We cant get there with the old mindset. Just forget it and put it aside. Think of the new people who will come. Then we can achieve our five million, President Wickremesinghe asserted. The President concluded his address by expressing confidence in the industrys ability to achieve the 5 million tourist target and urged stakeholders to aim higher, setting a goal of 7.5 million with higher-paying tourists. He emphasized the importance of maximizing earnings and attracting tourists from both domestic and international markets without unnecessary restrictions. The President also took the opportunity to honour two stalwarts of the hotel industry, presenting lifetime achievement awards to Mr. Srilal Miththapala and Mr. Hiran Cooray for their significant contributions. The event was attended by key figures in the government, including Minister of Tourism, Lands, Sports, and Youth Affairs Harin Fernando, Secretary of the Ministry of Tourism and Lands H. M. P. B. Herath, and officials from the Hotel Association of Sri Lanka, as well as experts in the hotel industry. As Sri Lanka embarks on this transformative journey to position itself as a premier tourist destination, the Presidents vision sets the stage for a dynamic and prosperous future for the countrys tourism sector, according to the PMD.",

        "date": "November 28, 2023 09:49 pm",
        "content": "Sri Lanka needs 100 billion to become a net zero emitter by 2040, President Ranil Wickremesinghe said on Tuesday, as the island also attempts to build climate change resilience while navigating its worst financial crisis in decades. Sri Lanka will focus on green financing tools, including debt for nature swaps as it attempts to reach the net zero target, Wickremesinghe told Reuters in an interview. But he added it does not have immediate plans to utilise green bonds. Some (funds) will come from investors who are interested, and I think we have an early start compared to others. We may invite in foreign investments. Rest, lets hope our economy picks up and we have sufficient money to put into it, he said. Sri Lanka, a small island off the southern tip of India with a population of 22 million, is struggling to emerge from its worst financial crisis in decades after a severe shortage of foreign exchange reserves shattered the economy last year. The island also faces the challenge of building more resilience to climate change. It is among countries most affected by extreme weather events and is expected to see a 1.2 annual GDP loss by 2050 due to climate change, according to the World Bank. It is estimated that close to 19 million Sri Lankans may live in areas that could become moderate or severe hotspots in terms of floods or droughts by 2050. Sri Lanka will set out two regional proposals at the U.N climate summit COP28, taking place from Nov. 30 to Dec. 12 in Dubai, which it hopes will focus on linking countries in the tropical belt to collectively combat climate change and promote the Indian Ocean as a carbon sink. Tropical belt has virtually 40 of the forests, in 2040 it will have 50 of the worlds population so lets fix it in the tropical belt. That also has an impact elsewhere, Wickremesinghe said, pointing out it could make a radical change in the fight against climate change. Sri Lanka will also propose setting up an international climate change university and is willing to allocate 600 acres (240 hectares) for the project to promote research on global climate change policies.

Jerome Fernando returned to the island from Singapore on board a flight attached to Qatar Airlines and left the airport through the Golden route of the BIA, according to Ada Derana reporter. Accordingly, he is slated to give a statement to the Criminal Investigations Department (CID) within 48 hours as per a court order. On November 17, the Court of Appeal ordered the CID not to arrest Pastor Fernando upon his arrival in the country. The ruling also mentioned the self-styled prophet should record a statement with the CIDs Cyber Crime Investigation Division within 48 hours of his arrival. This interim order was issued in respect of the petition filed by Pastor Fernando, seeking to prevent the CID from arresting him. The self-styled prophet found himself in hot water after a video of a sermon delivered by him was widely circulated on social media, stirring much controversy in the country, due to allegations that it included derogatory statements related to Lord Buddha and other religious figures. Subsequently, President Ranil Wickremesinghe had ordered the CID to launch an immediate investigation into the matter, citing that such statements could create religious conflicts and harm the countrys harmony. However, Pastor Fernando flew out to Singapore two days before the Colombo Fort Magistrates Court banned his foreign travels on May 16. However, the police had said Pastor Fernando could be arrested upon his return to the island. On May 26, Fernando had filed an FR petition before the court, through his attorneys, seeking an order preventing his arrest. The Inspector-General of Police (IGP), the DIG in charge of the CID, the CID director and the Officer-in-Charge (OIC) of the cybercrimes unit of the CID had been named as the respondents of the FR petition.

        "date": "November 29, 2023 02:55 pm",
        "content": "A U.S. military aircraft with eight people onboard crashed into the sea in western Japan on Wednesday with fishermen reporting three people had been found but that their condition was unknown. The coast guard said it had sent patrol boats and aircraft to the area where the tilt-rotor V-22 Osprey crashed off the island of Yakushima. Fishing boats in the area found three people in the surrounding waters, a representative of a local fisheries cooperative said. The crashed occurred near the islands airport, where another Osprey successfully landed on Wednesday afternoon, a spokesperson for the prefectural government said. U.S. forces in the region were still gathering information, a spokesperson said. The crash happened just before 3 p.m. (0600 GMT) with witnesses saying the aircrafts left engine appeared to be on fire as it descended, media reported. The aircraft disappeared from radar at 2.40 p.m. local time, Japan Chief Cabinet Secretary Hirokazu Matsuno said. The plane, which can fly both like a helicopter and fixed-wing aircraft, is operated by the U.S. Marines, U.S. Navy and the Japan Self Defense Forces. The deployment of the Osprey in Japan has been controversial, with critics saying it is prone to accidents. The U.S. military and Japan say it is safe. In August, a U.S. Osprey crashed off the coast of northern Australia while transporting troops during a routine military exercise, killing three U.S. Marines. Another crash-landed in the ocean off Japans southern island of Okinawa in December 2016, prompting a temporary U.S. military grounding of the aircraft. Source - Reuters --Agencies",
