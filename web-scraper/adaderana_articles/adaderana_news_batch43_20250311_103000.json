        "title": "Haitian gang kills at least 70 people, including 3 infants, UN says",
        "date": "October 4, 2024 10:22 pm",
        "content": "Armed men belonging to the Gran Grif gang killed at least 70 people, including three infants, as they swept through a Haitian town shooting automatic rifles at residents, a spokesperson for the United Nations Human Rights Office said on Friday. We are horrified by Thursdays gang attacks in the town of Pont-Sonde in Haitis Artibonite department, spokesperson Thameen Al-Kheetan said in a statement. At least another 16 people were seriously injured in the attack in the early hours of Thursday, including two gang members hit during an exchange of fire with Haitian police, according to the U.N. The gang members reportedly set fire to at least 45 houses and 34 vehicles, forcing residents to flee their homes. This odious crime against defenseless women, men and children is not only an attack against victims but against the entire Haitian nation, Prime Minister Garry Conille said on X. Security forces, backed by our international partners, are reinforcing their intervention. In an audio message shared on social media on Thursday, Gran Grif leader Luckson Elan, who was sanctioned by the U.N. last month, blamed the state and victims for the attacks, accusing residents of remaining passive while his soldiers were killed by police or vigilante groups. Its Pont-Sonde residents who are at fault. What happened in Pont-Sonde is the fault of the state, he said. Local media reported on Thursday that thousands of residents from Pont-Sonde were making their way toward the coastal town of Saint-Marc. Pont-Sonde is a major rice producer located in Haitis breadbasket Artibonite region at an important crossing connecting the capital Port-au-Prince to the north. Artibonite has seen some of the worst violence outside the capital, compounding a worsening hunger crisis that has seen half the population suffer from severe food insecurity and thousands in Port-au-Prince facing famine-level hunger. Gang leader Jimmy Barbeque Cherizier, who has acted as spokesperson for an alliance of armed gangs in the capital, said in a video the attack was part of a plan to prevent Artibonite from supplying food to the country. The number of people internally displaced by the conflict has meanwhile surged past 700,000, nearly doubling in six months despite the partial deployment of a U.N.-backed mission mandated to help under-resourced police restore order. Haitis government had requested that the mission, which is made up of volunteer contributions and has so far received just a fraction of the resources it was promised, be converted into a formal U.N. peacekeeping mission. That proposal was blocked by Russia and China at the U.N. Security Council. We call for increased international financial and logistical assistance to the Multinational Security Support Mission in Haiti, Al-Kheetan said, calling for an urgent investigation and reparations for the victims. The U.N. estimated at the end of September that 3,661 people had been killed in the conflict since January, which amounts to over 13 killed daily this year. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "title": "Israel targets Hezbollah intel HQ in Lebanon, Iran says it will not back down",
        "date": "October 5, 2024 09:57 am",
        "content": "Israel said it had targeted the intelligence headquarters of Hezbollah in Beirut and was assessing the damage on Friday after a series of strikes on senior figures in the group that Irans Supreme Leader dismissed as counterproductive. Israel has been weighing options in its response to Irans ballistic missile attack on Tuesday, which Iran had carried out in response to Israels military action in Lebanon. Oil prices have risen on the possibility of an attack on Irans oil facilities as Israel pursues its goals of pushing back Hezbollah militants in Lebanon and eliminating their Hamas allies in Gaza. The air attack on Beirut, part of a wider assault that has driven more than 1.2 million Lebanese from their homes, was reported to have targeted the potential successor to the leader of Iran-backed Hezbollah, Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, killed by Israel a week ago. Hashem Safieddines fate was unclear and neither Israel nor Hezbollah have offered any comment. A blast was heard and smoke was seen over Beiruts southern suburbs early on Saturday, Reuters witnesses said, as the Israeli military issued three alerts for residents of the area to immediately evacuate. The first alert warned residents in a building in the Burj al-Barajneh neighbourhood and the second in a building in Choueifat district. The third alert mentioned buildings in Haret Hreik as well as Burj al-Barajneh. In a statement early on Saturday, Hezbollah also said the Israeli army was trying to infiltrate the Lebanese southern town of Odaisseh and that clashes there were ongoing. U.S. President Joe Biden said on Friday he would think about alternatives to striking Iranian oil fields if he were in Israels shoes, adding that he thinks Israel has not yet concluded how to respond to Iran. Biden was asked at a White House press briefing if he thought that by not engaging in diplomacy, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was trying to influence the Nov. 5 U.S. election in which Republican former President Donald Trump faces Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris. Whether he is trying to influence the election, I dont know but I am not counting on that, Biden said in response. No administration has done more to help Israel than I have. The government in Lebanon says more than 2,000 people have been killed there in the past year, most in the past two weeks. U.N. spokesperson Stephane Dujarric called the toll on civilians totally unacceptable. The Lebanese government has accused Israel of targeting civilians, pointing to dozens of women and children killed. It has not broken down the overall figure between civilians and Hezbollah fighters. Israel says it targets military capabilities and takes steps to mitigate the risk of harm to civilians. It accuses Hezbollah and Hamas of hiding among civilians, which they deny. The U.S. State Department said that an American was killed in Lebanon this week and Washington was working to understand the circumstances of the incident. Kamel Ahmad Jawad, from Dearborn, Michigan, was killed in an Israeli airstrike on Tuesday, according to his daughter, a friend and the U.S. congresswoman representing his district. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said the department was alarmed by the reports, and added: it is a moral and strategic imperative that Israel take all feasible precautions to mitigate civilian harm. The latest bloodletting in the decades-old Israeli-Palestinian conflict stems from an attack by Palestinian Hamas militants Oct. 7, 2023, that killed 1,200 and in which about 250 were taken as hostages, according to Israeli tallies. Israels subsequent assault on Gaza has killed over 41,000 Palestinians, according to Gazas health ministry, and displaced nearly Gazas entire population, caused a hunger crisis and led to genocide allegations that Israel denies. The Israeli military said some 70 projectiles were launched from Lebanon into Israeli territory on Friday evening and were either intercepted or fell in open land. Israel sent ground forces into Lebanon this week after the Iranian missiles attacks. It has said its ground operations are localized in villages near the border, but has not specified how far into Lebanon they would advance or how long they would last. Israel says the operations aim to allow tens of thousands of its citizens to return home after Hezbollah bombardments that forced them to evacuate from its north. IRAN VOWS NOT TO BACK DOWN Irans missile salvo was partly in retaliation for Israels killing of Hezbollah secretary-general Nasrallah, a dominant figure who had turned the group into a powerful armed and political force with reach across the Middle East. Iranian leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei told a huge crowd in Tehran that Iran and its regional allies would not back down. Israels adversaries in the region should double your efforts and capabilities... and resist the aggressive enemy, Khamenei said in a rare appearance leading Friday prayers, at which he mentioned Nasrallah and called Irans attack on Israel legal and legitimate. He said Iran would not procrastinate nor act hastily to carry out its duty in confronting Israel. The semi-official Iranian news agency SNN quoted Revolutionary Guards deputy commander Ali Fadavi as saying on Friday that if Israel attacked, Tehran would target Israeli energy and gas installations. Axios reporter Barak Ravid cited three Israeli officials as saying that Hezbollah official Safieddine, rumoured to be Nasrallahs successor, had been targeted in an underground bunker in Beirut overnight but his fate was not clear. Israeli Lieutenant Colonel Nadav Shoshani said on Friday the military was still assessing the Thursday night airstrikes, which he said targeted Hezbollahs intelligence headquarters. Earlier the Israeli military reported that it had killed the head of Hezbollahs communication networks, Mohammad Rashid Sakafi. It declined to comment on the report that Safieddine was targeted. Hezbollah made no comment on the fate of Sakafi. Khamenei said assassinations would just spur more attacks. Every strike launched by any group against Israel is a service to the region and to all humanity, he said, adding that Afghanistan should join the defence. FLATTENED BEIRUT BUILDINGS In Hezbollahs stronghold in Beiruts southern suburbs, many buildings have been reduced to rubble. Nearly all the storefronts in the main market street, Moawad Souk, were damaged and the road filled with broken glass. Were alive but dont know for how long, said Nouhad Chaib, a 40-year-old man already displaced from the south. The Islamic Health Authority, a civil defence agency linked to Hezbollah, said 11 medics had been killed in three separate Israeli attacks across southern Lebanon on Friday. The Israeli military said that in the past day it had struck several weapons storage facilities, command and control centres, and Hezbollah infrastructure sites in the Beirut area. Irans Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi, visiting Beirut and meeting with top Lebanese officials, said Tehran supported efforts for a ceasefire in Lebanon provided it was backed by Hezbollah and was simultaneous with a Gaza ceasefire.

        "title": "Tunisia votes Sunday in its third presidential election since the Arab Spring",
        "date": "October 5, 2024 01:07 pm",
        "content": "With his major opponents imprisoned or left off the ballot, Tunisian President Kais Saied faces few obstacles to winning reelection on Sunday, five years after riding anti-establishment backlash to a first term. The North African countrys Oct. 6 presidential election is its third since protests led to the 2011 ouster of President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali  the first autocrat toppled in the Arab Spring uprisings that also overthrew leaders in Egypt, Libya and Yemen. International observers praised the previous two contests as meeting democratic norms. However, a raft of arrests and actions taken by a Saied-appointed election authority have raised questions about whether this years race is free and fair. And opposition parties have called for a boycott. Whats at stake? Not long ago, Tunisia was hailed as the Arab Springs only success story. As coups, counter-revolutions and civil wars convulsed the region, the North African nation enshrined a new democratic constitution and saw its leading civil society groups win the Nobel Peace Prize for brokering political compromise. But its new leaders were unable to buoy its struggling economy and were plagued by political infighting and episodes of violence and terrorism. Amid that backdrop, Saied, then 61 and a political outsider, won his first term in 2019. He advanced to a runoff promising to usher in a New Tunisia and hand more power to young people and local governments. This years election will offer a window into popular opinion about the trajectory that Tunisias fading democracy has taken since Saied took office. Saieds supporters appear to have remained loyal to him and his promise to transform Tunisia. But he isnt affiliated with any political party, and its unclear just how deep his support runs among Tunisians. Its the first presidential race since Saied upended the countrys politics in July 2021, declaring a state of emergency, sacking his prime minister, suspending the parliament and rewriting Tunisias constitution consolidating his own power. Those actions outraged pro-democracy groups and leading opposition parties, who called them a coup. Yet despite anger from career politicians, voters approved Saieds new constitution the following year in a low-turnout referendum. Authorities subsequently began arresting Saieds critics including journalists, lawyers, politicians and civil society figures, charging them with endangering state security and violating a controversial anti-fake news law that observers argue stifles dissent. Fewer voters turned out to participate in parliamentary and local elections in 2022 and 2023 amid economic woes and widespread political apathy. Whos running? Many wanted to challenge Saied, but few were able to. Seventeen potential candidates filed paperwork to run and Tunisias election authority approved only three: Saied, Zouhair Maghzaoui and Ayachi Zammel. Maghzaoui is a veteran politician who has campaigned against Saieds economic program and recent political arrests. Still, he is loathed by opposition parties for backing Saieds constitution and earlier moves to consolidate power. Zammel is a businessman supported by politicians not boycotting the race. During the campaign, he has been sentenced to prison time in four voter fraud cases related to signatures his team gathered to qualify for the ballot. Others had hoped to run but were prevented. The election authority, known as ISIE, last month dismissed a court ruling ordering it to reinstate three additional challengers. With many arrested, detained or convicted on charges related to their political activities, Tunisias most well-known opposition figures are also not participating. That includes the 83-year-old leader of Tunisias most well organized political party Ennahda, which rose to power after the Arab Spring. Rached Ghannouchi, the Islamist partys co-founder and Tunisias former house speaker, has been imprisoned since last year after criticizing Saied. The crackdown also includes one of Ghannouchis most vocal detractors: Abir Moussi, a right-wing lawmaker known for railing against Islamists and speaking nostalgically for pre-Arab Spring Tunisia. The 49-year-old president of the Free Destourian Party also was imprisoned last year after criticizing Saied. Other less known politicians who announced plans to run have also since been jailed or sentenced on similar charges. Opposition groups have called to boycott the race. The National Salvation Front a coalition of secular and Islamist parties including Ennahda  has denounced the process as a sham and questioned the elections legitimacy. What are the other issues? The countrys economy continues to face major challenges. Despite Saieds promises to chart a new course for Tunisia, unemployment has steadily increased to one of the regions highest at 16, with young Tunisians hit particularly hard. Growth has been slow since the COVID-19 pandemic and Tunisia has remained reliant on multilateral lenders such as the World Bank and the European Union. Today, Tunisia owes them more than 9 billion. Apart from agricultural reform, Saieds overarching economic strategy is unclear. Negotiations have long been stalled over a 1.9 billion bailout package offered by the International Monetary Fund in 2022. Saied has been unwilling to accept its conditions, which include restructuring indebted state-owned companies and cutting public wages. Some of the IMFs stipulations including lifting subsidies for electricity, flour and fuel would likely be unpopular among Tunisians who rely on their low costs. Economic analysts say that foreign and local investors are reluctant to invest in Tunisia due to continued political risks and an absence of reassurances. The dire economic straits have had a two-pronged effect on one of Tunisias key political issues: migration. From 2019 to 2023, an increasing number of Tunisians attempted to migrate to Europe without authorization. Meanwhile, Saieds administration has taken a harsh approach against migrants arriving from sub-Saharan Africa, many who have found themselves stuck in Tunisia while trying to reach Europe. Saied energized his supporters in early 2023 by accusing migrants of violence and crime and portraying them as part of a plot to change the countrys demography. The anti-migrant rhetoric prompted extreme violence against migrants and a crackdown from authorities. Last year, security forces targeted migrant communities from the coast to the capital with a series of arrests, deportation to the desert and the demolition of tent camps in Tunis and coastal towns. Bodies continue to wash ashore on Tunisias coastline as boats carrying Tunisians and migrants from sub-Saharan Africa manage only to make it a few nautical miles before sinking. What does it mean overseas? Tunisia has maintained ties with its traditional Western allies but also forged new partnerships under Saied. Much like many populist leaders whove taken power worldwide, Saied emphasizes sovereignty and freeing Tunisia from what he calls foreign diktats. He has insisted that Tunisia wont become a border guard for Europe, which has sought agreements with him to better police the Mediterranean. Tunisia and Iran lifted visa requirements and in May announced plans to boost trade ties. It has also accepted millions in loans as part of Chinas Belt and Road Initiative to build hospitals, stadiums and ports. Yet European countries remain Tunisias top trade partners and their leaders have maintained productive ties with Saied, hailing agreements to manage migration as a model for the region. Saied has spoken ardently in support of Palestinians as war has swept the Middle East and opposes moves made to normalize diplomatic ties with Israel. Source: AP --Agencies",

        "title": "Will never allow Sri Lankan territory to be used inimical for Indias security interests  President",
        "date": "October 5, 2024 02:14 pm",
        "content": "President Anura Kumara Dissanayake has reiterated that Sri Lankan territory would never allowed to be used in a manner inimical to Indias security interests. Dissanayake highlighted this, during a discussion held in Colombo with Indias External Affairs Minister (EAM) Dr. S. Jaishankar who visited Sri Lanka on Friday (04). Issuing a statement regarding Dr. S. Jaishankars Sri Lanka visit, the Indian High Commission in Sri Lanka stated that regarding security and defence, the meetings brought out that the interests of India and Sri Lanka were closely intertwined. Their collaboration was in mutual interest and contributed to the stability and security of the region. The importance of a continuous dialogue that would promote trust, transparency and mutual sensitivity was recognized. Furthermore, with regard to the ethnic issue and the reconciliation process, EAM reiterated Indias support for the aspirations of all communities, including Tamils, for equality, justice, dignity, peace while maintaining the unity, territorial integrity and sovereignty of Sri Lanka., the Indian High Commission mentioned. Meanwhile, he has assured that the full and effective implementation of the 13th Amendment of its Constitution and the early holding of Provincial Council elections will facilitate these objectives. In his meeting with the President, Dr. Jaishankar spoke about ongoing initiatives in the field of energy production and transmission, fuel and LNG supply, solar electrification of religious places, connectivity, digital public infrastructure, health and dairy development. He highlighted that they would contribute to economic sustainability and provide new streams of revenue. The Sri Lankan President said that Indias economic support is critical to realize his vision of a prosperous Sri Lanka and meeting the aspirations of the people. He referred to the potential of export of renewable energy to India which could help reduce production costs in Sri Lanka and create additional resources. The President also noted the contribution of Indian tourists and recognized that this has the potential to grow further, the Indian High Commission added. EAMs conversation with the leadership also covered facilitating Indian investments and job creation in Sri Lanka, as well as expanding the flow of Indian tourists. In his meeting with Prime Minister Amarasuriya, he underlined that the Government of India was prepared to respond to the training and capacity building requirements of Sri Lanka. Their discussion also focused on the benefits of digital public infrastructure, the statement highlighted. On Sri Lankas debt restructuring efforts, EAM recalled that India had been supportive of Sri Lankas economic stability and recovery from the very start. It was the first country to give financing assurances which enabled the IMF to finalize the Extended Fund Facility. He confirmed Indias support in the Official Creditors Committee in respect of Sri Lankas agreement with International Sovereign Bond holders. India is also willing to expedite the conclusion of its bilateral MoU with Sri Lanka, the Indian High Commission said, noting that the President conveyed his appreciation in that regard.",

        "date": "October 5, 2024 02:52 pm",
        "content": "President Anura Kumara Dissanayake visited the headquarters of the Amarapura Maha Nikaya in Wellawatte this morning (05) and received blessings from the Acting Maha Nayaka, Most Venerable Karagoda Uyangoda Maithri Murthi Maha Nayaka Thero of Amarapura Nikaya. The Nayaka Theros of the Secretariat of the Amarapura Maha Nikaya were also present at this occasion, where they invoked blessings for the President, the Presidents Media Division (PMD) said. During the discussion, the Chief Prelate emphasized the need to build a strong state by maximizing the use of the countrys resources. He noted that only then could Sri Lanka rise as an independent nation on the global stage. The President acknowledged that the current period, with a General Election already announced, is a politically transitional time. He expressed his intention to accelerate progress on key tasks with full Parliamentary power following the election, it said. The Chief Prelate and the senior Theros also praised the example set by the President and his team, especially during the post-election period, where they ensured no violent incidents or disturbances occurred. The Maha Sangha further highlighted that, during the last Presidential election, certain groups attempted to organize campaigns against the current President by using religion as a tool, but those accusations have now been proven false. However, the Maha Sangha cautioned the President to remain vigilant as similar smear campaigns may arise in the future, the PMD reported. President Dissanayake remarked that the people, through the results of this Presidential election, have shown the need to change the traditional political system. He also noted that the public has rejected the slander and fears that were created about his team, confirming that these were merely baseless rumours. During the discussion, the Maha Sangha inquired about the possibility of a new constitution, to which the President responded by stating that he hopes to introduce a new constitution but emphasized that it will only be done following thorough discussions and a referendum. He pointed out that the previous governments implemented constitutional amendments without public consensus. The President also pledged to bring forward a constitutional amendment that meets the expectations of the people, after stabilizing the country to some extent, the statement added. Meanwhile, President Anura Kumara Dissanayake also visited the headquarters of the Sri Lanka Ramanna Maha Nikaya in Narahenpita this morning (05), where he met with the Chief Prelate, Most Venerable Makulewe Wimala Nayaka Thero, Aggamaha Panditha of the Sri Lanka Ramanna Maha Nikaya, and received his blessings. The Anunayaka Theros, Lekhadhikari Theros, and other senior Theros of the Nikaya were also present at the occasion. The Maha Sangha chanted Seth Pirith to invoke blessings upon the President, the PMD said. The Deputy Chief Prelates, Secretarial Theros, and other senior monks of the Nikaya were also present at the occasion. They invoked Seth Pirith and bestowed blessings upon the President. Following this, the President engaged in a brief discussion with the Chief Prelate and the Maha Sangha regarding the current economic, social and political situation in the country. During the discussion, the monks requested that when appointing Ambassadors and High Commissioners, the President should ensure that qualified, intelligent individuals who can properly represent the country abroad are selected. Similarly, they urged the appointment of responsible individuals, free from political considerations, for the positions of Governors, the statement added. The Maha Sangha also emphasized that when appointing Secretaries to Ministries, the President should choose suitable individuals for the respective roles. President Anura Kumara Dissanayake stated that his goal is to make all decisions in line with the policies outlined in his manifesto. He further mentioned that he plans to introduce relevant reforms after the upcoming General Election, the PMD reported. Most Venerable Makulewe Wimala Nayaka Thero also expressed confidence that the trust placed in the President and his team by the people during the last Presidential Election will be fulfilled, and that the blessings of the Sangha are with him to help realize the expectations of the public. --PMD--",

        "title": "Lebanon hospitals close as Israeli strikes hit health facilities",
        "date": "October 5, 2024 05:05 pm",
        "content": "At least four hospitals in Lebanon announced on Friday that they were suspending work because of Israeli strikes, while a Hezbollah-affiliated health organisation said that 11 paramedics had been killed in the past 24 hours. The four closures capped two weeks of Israeli strikes on hospitals and healthcare workers in Lebanon that have shuttered at least 37 facilities and killed dozens of medical staff, according to the World Health Organisation. Late on Friday night, the Israeli army issued a statement alleging that Hezbollah was using medical vehicles to transport fighters and weapons, warning that it would strike any vehicle it suspected of being used for military purposes. Hospital staff in southern Lebanon told the BBC that health facilities treating wounded civilians had been hit with direct Israeli strikes. The BBC has approached the IDF for comment. Dr Mounes Kalakish, director of the Marjayoun governmental hospital in southern Lebanon, told the BBC that the hospital had no choice but to close on Friday after an airstrike hit two ambulances at the hospitals entrance way on Friday, killing seven paramedics. The nurses and doctors were terrified, he said. We tried to calm them and carry on working, but it was not possible. The emergency director of the hospital, Dr Shoshana Mazraani, said she was sitting at the front of the building when the strike happened. She said that she heard the cries of the paramedics who were hit and ran towards the damaged ambulances, but was warned to stay back by colleagues fearful of a follow up strike. The Marjayoun hospital had already been hanging on by a thread, Dr Mazraani said, with a core team of just 20 doctors remaining from the centres usual 120 staff. The closure on Friday was a tragedy for the region, she said. We serve a huge population here, many villages. We had 45 inpatient beds, all now empty. We were the only hospital providing dialysis in the region, for example. We have had to turn away emergency patients and tell others to leave. Rita Suleiman, the nursing director at the Saint Therese hospital, on the edge of Beiruts southern suburbs, told the BBC that the hospital had also struggled on after being badly damaged by a strike on Friday but was later forced to suspend all services. Other hospitals were carrying on with severely limited services. Dr Mohammed Hamadeh, director of the Tebnine hospital, told the BBC on Friday a nearby strike had rocked the building. The blast was very close, he said. We are still trying to operate but we cannot leave the confines of the hospital because it is too dangerous. Late on Friday night, the Salah Ghandour hospital in Bint Jbeil announced it had closed after being violently shelled, following an order from the Israeli army to evacuate. The Israeli army said it was targeting a mosque adjacent to the hospital which it claimed was being used by Hezbollah fighters. The strikes on healthcare facilities have not been limited to the south of Lebanon. Israel hit a medical centre in central Beirut on Thursday belonging to the Hezbollah-linked Islamic Health Organisation, killing nine and wounding 14. The Israeli army said the strike targeted terror assets. The Lebanese Red Cross said on Thursday that four of its paramedics were wounded in a strike on a convoy evacuating patients, despite the organisation co-ordinating with the Israeli army. Gabriel Karlsson, country manager in Beirut for the British Red Cross, told the BBC: Health and aid workers must be able to help those in need without fearing for their own safety. Teams from the Red Cross and Red Crescent are a lifeline, supporting communities tirelessly - they must be protected. World Health Organisation director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on Thursday that 28 healthcare workers had been killed in Lebanon over the previous 24 hours, and many other healthcare staff were no longer reporting for work because of the strikes. Dr Kalakish, the director of the Marjayoun hospital, told the BBC that prior to the strike that closed his hospital it was already operating with no anaesthesiologist or other specialists. Some staff had fled the bombardment for their own safety, he said, while others had been prevented from reaching the hospital because of air strikes on nearby roads. Lebanons Health Minister Firass Abiad said on Thursday that 97 rescue workers had been killed since Hezbollah and Israel began fighting last October. More than 40 of those  paramedics and firefighters  were in just three days this past week, he said. Source: BBC --Agencies",

        "date": "October 5, 2024 06:30 pm",
        "content": "The Public Health Inspectors Union has reassured the public that there is no need for undue concern regarding imported coconut oil. Commenting regarding the rising suspicions surrounding the safety and quality of coconut oil entering Sri Lanka, the Chairman of the Public Health Inspectors Union Upul Rohana said: When coconut oil is imported to Sri Lanka, a special inspection is conducted by food inspectors from the Food Control Unit at Sri Lanka Customs. Imported RBD (Refined, Bleached, and Deodorized) oil can be sold as regular coconut oil, provided it adheres to the standards set by the 1987 directives under the Food Act No. 26 of 1980. There is no legal obstacle to its sale. Mr Rohana emphasized that, in addition to customs inspections, the Public Health Inspectors conduct regular checks on coconut oil available in stores, both locally produced and imported. Random sampling and testing are done by public health inspectors. Sometimes we detect aflatoxins in both local and imported coconut oil, and in such cases, we take legal action and remove the affected products from the market, he explained. He also noted that Sri Lankas domestic production of coconut oil is insufficient to meet demand, which is why imports are necessary. The public should not be alarmed. Imported coconut oil, as long as it complies with current standards, is safe for consumption, Rohana stated, urging consumers not to succumb to unnecessary fears. However, concerns have been raised by the All Ceylon Traditional Coconut Oil Producers Association, which alleges that a racket is operating, selling imported oilclaimed to be toxicas locally produced coconut oil.",

        "date": "October 5, 2024 07:22 pm",
        "content": "Sri Lanka Police informs that anyone with evidence or knowledge of any exam questions, other than the three questions already alleged to have been leaked, being disclosed prior to the 2024 Scholarship Examination, to come forward with complaints by October 7, 2024. Issuing a statement in this regard, the Police Media Division stated that complaints can be submitted at the offices of Senior Superintendents of Police (SSP) in police divisions across the island. Those unable to visit these offices can instead file complaints at the nearest police station, where the Divisional Criminal Investigation Unit will record the information and forward it to the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) for further investigation. Evidence in any form, including documents or other instruments, can be presented to support complaints, the police said, having assured the public that all complaints will be thoroughly investigated, with additional instructions already issued to the CID to take prompt action regarding the matter. The public is encouraged to cooperate fully in bringing any relevant information to light, helping to ensure transparency and fairness in the examination process, the police said. On September 20, an investigation was launched by the Department of Examinations after it was alleged that a question paper from the exam had been leaked. Later, the initial investigation report has been handed over to the Criminal Investigation Department (CID), which is currently conducting further inquiries. Meanwhile, the Secretary of the Ministry of Education, Thilaka Jayasundara, announced that the paper marking process of the Grade 5 Scholarship Examination, which was held on September 15, has been temporarily suspended, owing to the issue. Furthermore, the Education Ministry said the decision on whether to hold the Grade 5 Scholarship Examination again or not will be made after the CID and the Exams Department complete their investigations into the alleged leaking of questions. The decision will be based on the findings and recommendations of the relevant investigations, according to the Ministry Secretary. The Commissioner General of Examinations Amit Jayasundara said that investigations are being held into an incident where three questions similar to those on the Grade 5 Scholarship exam paper had allegedly been posted online via a model exam paper. He had also stated that if investigations uncover that the questions have in fact been leaked, the relevant questions would be disregarded during the paper marking process. He revealed that an investigation was conducted based on the information received alleging that a teacher in the Alawwa area had uploaded a model question paper to social media which had included three questions similar to three questions in the first paper of the Grade 5 Scholarship Exam. However, the parents have requested that the President to consider holding a re-examination for the first paper of the Grade 5 Scholarship Examination, as they claimed eight questions, and not three, were leaked prior to the exam. This years scholarship exam was held at 2,849 centers across the island, with 323,879 candidates participating.",

        "content": "Indian Minister of External Affairs Dr. Subrahmanyam Jaishankar says the political trauma Sri Lanka had to experience two years ago was a result of both internal and external factors. Addressing a discussion organised by the U.S. think tank Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, the Indian External Affairs Minister said conflicts in a specific region can have serious impacts on other regions of the world, especially the global south. The international economy today is fragile. I have travelled to various parts of the world which has had a very hard time for the last five years, where people have seen a visible sort of drop in the quality of life. I may mention Sri Lanka. Ive been in that country, Ive been going there from time to time. I think part of what explains political shifts there was actually the trauma that they underwent as a result of some sort of factors within their control, but some of it was not, he said. Furthermore, Dr. Jaishankar added: Now, what the lessons of tensions of conflicts what we saw in Ukraine, what we see in the Middle Eastthat in a globalized world, conflicts and tensions anyway are going to cause problems everywhere. Its not regional. It is going to come at everybody in some form or other. The global south is extremely concerned about new factors of stress, tensions, anxiety, more pressures on the system because they are at the bottom of the change. We feel the pain. Today, people want reassurance, they want stability. Nobody wants more anxiety, he signed off.",

        "title": "Nasrallahs possible successor out of contact since Friday, Lebanese source says",
        "date": "October 5, 2024 10:41 pm",
        "content": "The potential successor to slain Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah has been out of contact since Friday, a Lebanese security source said on Saturday, after an Israeli airstrike that is reported to have targeted him. In its campaign against the Iran-backed Lebanese group, Israel carried out a large strike on Beiruts southern suburbs late on Thursday that Axios cited three Israeli officials as saying targeted Hashem Safieddine in an underground bunker. The Lebanese security source and two other Lebanese security sources said that ongoing Israeli strikes on Beiruts southern suburb - known as Dahiyeh - since Friday have kept rescue workers from scouring the site of the attack. Hezbollah has made no comment so far on Safieddine since the attack. Israeli Lieutenant Colonel Nadav Shoshani said on Friday the military was still assessing the Thursday night airstrikes, which he said targeted Hezbollahs intelligence headquarters. The loss of Nasrallahs rumoured successor would be yet another blow to Hezbollah and its patron Iran. Israeli strikes across the region in the past year, sharply accelerated in the past few weeks, have decimated Hezbollahs leadership. Israel expanded its conflict in Lebanon on Saturday with its first strike in the northern city of Tripoli, a Lebanese security official said, after more bombs hit Beirut suburbs and Israeli troops launched raids in the south. Israel has begun an intense bombing campaign in Lebanon and sent troops across the border in recent weeks after nearly a year of exchanging fire with Hezbollah. Fighting had previously been mostly limited to the Israel-Lebanon border area, taking place in parallel to Israels year-old war in Gaza against Palestinian group Hamas. Israel says it aims to allow the safe return of tens of thousands of citizens to their homes in northern Israel, bombarded by Hezbollah since Oct.8 last year. The Israeli attacks have eliminated much of Hezbollahs senior military leadership, including Secretary General Nasrallah in an air attack on Sept. 27. The Israeli assault has also killed hundreds of ordinary Lebanese, including rescue workers, Lebanese officials say, and forced 1.2 million people - almost a quarter of the population - to flee their homes. The Lebanese security official told Reuters that Saturdays strike on a Palestinian refugee camp in Tripoli killed a member of Hamas, his wife and two children. Media affiliated with the Palestinian group also said the strike killed a leader of its armed wing. The Israeli military did not immediately comment on the strike on Tripoli, a Sunni Muslim-majority port city that its warplanes also targeted during a 2006 war with Hezbollah. Israel has meanwhile staged nightly bombardment of Dahiyeh, once a bustling and densely populated area of Beirut and a stronghold for Hezbollah. On Saturday, smoke billowed over Dahiyeh, large parts of which have been reduced to rubble sending residents fleeing to other parts of Beirut or of Lebanon. In northern Israel, air raid sirens sent people running for their shelters amid rocket fire from Lebanon. ISRAEL WEIGHS OPTIONS FOR IRAN The violence comes as the anniversary approaches of Hamas attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, which killed 1,200 people and in which about 250 were taken as hostages, according to Israeli tallies. Israels subsequent assault on Gaza has killed nearly 42,000 Palestinians, according to Gazas health ministry, and displaced nearly all of the enclaves population of 2.3 million. Iran, which backs both Hezbollah and Hamas, and which has lost key commanders of its elite Revolutionary Guards Corps to Israeli air strikes in Syria this year, launched a salvo of ballistic missiles at Israel on Tuesday. The strikes did little damage. Israel has been weighing options in its response to Irans attack. Oil prices have risen on the possibility of an attack on Irans oil facilities as Israel pursues its goals of pushing back Hezbollah militants in Lebanon and eliminating their Hamas allies in Gaza. U.S. President Joe Biden on Friday urged Israel to consider alternatives to striking Iranian oil fields, adding that he thinks Israel has not yet concluded how to respond to Iran. Israeli news website Ynet reported that the top U.S. general for the Middle East, Army General Michael Kurilla, is headed for Israel in the coming day. Israeli and U.S. officials were not immediately reachable for comment. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

Upon his arrival at the historic Anuradhapura sacred site, the President first met with the Atamasthanadhipathi, Chief Sanghanayaka of Nuwara Kalaviya, and Chief Administrator of the Anuradhapura Maha Viharaya, Most Venerable Pallekumbura Hemarathana Nayake Thero. During this meeting, the President engaged in a brief discussion, inquiring about the Venerable Theros well-being, the Presidents Media Division (PMD) said. Following this, the President proceeded to the Udamaluwa, where he participated in religious observances. At the main Dhamma Hall of the Jaya Sri Maha Bodhi, the Atamasthana Chief Prelate, along with the Maha Sangha, conducted Seth Pirith and invoked blessings upon the President. Also present at this religious ceremony were other Maha Sangha, including the Chief Incumbent of the Lankarama Viharaya Most Venerable Ralapanave Dhammajothi Nayake Thero , the Chief Incumbent of Ruwanweli Chathyaramaya Venerable Ethalawetunawewa Gnanatilake Thero, the Chief Incumbent of Thuparama Chathyaramaya Venerable Kahalle Gnaninda Thero, the Chief Incumbent of the Mirisavetiya Chathyaramaya Venerable Welihena Sobitha Thero, the Chief Incumbent of Abhayagiri Chathyaramaya Venerable Dr. Kalanchiye Rathanasiri Thero, the Chief Incumbent of the Historic Isurumuni Raja Maha Viharya Venerable Matawa Sumangala Thero and the Chief Incumbent of Anuradhapura Sri Sambuddha Jayanti Viharaya Venerable Nugatenne Pangnananda Thero. During his brief address, the Atamasthanadhipathi Most Venerable Pallekumbura Hemarathana Nayake Thero emphasized that the responsibility of uplifting the lives of the innocent people of this country and protecting the nation, race, and religion now rests on the shoulders of President Anura Kumara Dissanayake, it said. The Thero also pointed out that, as a leader emerging from the North Central Province (Raja Rata), the President has a special obligation to improve the lives of the people in the region who have long endured hardships. He further added that the Maha Sangha of the Mahavihara bestows their blessings upon the President to fulfil these responsibilities successfully. The Chief Prelate went on to observe that the current political environment is not conducive to someone with wisdom and insight. However, the Maha Sangha believes that the new President has the ability to foster a healthy political culture in the country, the statement added. Venerable Hemarathana Thero also highlighted the importance of establishing a National Policy, stressing that if the President can craft a long-term, beneficial national policy with the support of all Members of Parliament, it would be a significant achievement. Afterwards, President Anura Kumara Dissanayake visited the Ruwanwelisaya, where he received blessings from the Chief Incumbent, Venerable Ethalawetunawewa Gnanatilake Nayaka Thero, the PMD reported. Subsequently, the President participated in religious observances held in front of the Ruwanwelisaya, during which the Maha Sangha chanted Seth Pirith to invoke blessings upon the President. Governor of the North Central Province Wasantha Jinadasa, District Secretary Ranjith Wimalasuriya, former MP Wasantha Samarasinghe, Deputy Chairman of the All Ceylon Farmers Federation Susanta Navaratne, and Professor Sena Nanayakkara, along with others, were also present at these events, the statement added. --PMD--",

        "content": "Over 80 police personnel have been injured in clashes with supporters of jailed former Prime Minister Imran Khan taking part in a march near Islamabad, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi said on Saturday. The march, which is being led by the head of the northwestern province of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, where Khans party remains in power, aims to gather in the capital, defying a ban on congregations, to press for Khans release and agitate against the ruling coalition. The convoy, led by the chief minister, fired on the police and continuously used teargas against law-enforcers, Naqvi told journalists. He said more than 80 police officers had been treated for injuries since Friday, when clashes broke out just outside the city during an anti-government rally. Authorities have sealed off Islamabad and blocked cellphone services to prevent the gathering. Islamabad is on high alert ahead of a series of top-level diplomatic events scheduled over the next two weeks, including a visit by Indias Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar. Naqvi said while the convoy was heavily armed, the police had been instructed not to carry weapons to prevent the situation from escalating. The government has deployed the army to enhance security in Islamabad. The protesters plan to gather in the citys red zone, which houses the countrys parliament and a fortified enclave of foreign embassies. Khans Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party denies using violence, and says it wants to hold a peaceful gathering. Naqvi had previously called on the PTI to delay any gathering until after diplomatic engagements in the city, including a Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) meeting on Oct. 15-16 which will be attended by delegations, including from China, Russia and India. On Saturday, Naqvi said the authorities had intelligence that the protesters planned to disrupt the SCO conference in a bid to gain attention. We cant allow this. I will say to them again, to not cross more red lines - dont make us take extreme steps, Naqvi said. The PTI, which says the Islamabad protest is just for one day, is also holding a gathering in the eastern city of Lahore on Saturday, where a lockdown of roads is in place.

        "content": "56 Pakistanis imprisoned in Sri Lanka for several years are finally set to leave today. Their return follows months of diplomatic negotiations by the Pakistani government. A chartered flight has been dispatched to Sri Lanka to bring back the detainees. Federal Minister of Interior Mohsin Naqvi spearheaded the efforts to secure their release, maintaining close contact with Sri Lankan authorities over the last three months. According to Express News, federal minister for privatization Abdul Aleem Khan is covering all costs associated with the repatriation, ensuring the prisoners safe return. Mohsin Naqvi thanked the Sri Lankan government and its High Commissioner for their cooperation in the matter. He also expressed gratitude to Abdul Aleem Khan for his financial support, which made the repatriation possible. The return of these 56 Pakistanis comes after years of detention in Sri Lankan jails. Earlier in July, Sri Lankan High Commissioner Admiral (retd) Ravindra Chandra Srivijay Gunaratne met with Federal Minister of Interior and Narcotics Control Mohsin Naqvi on Friday, where they discussed various issues of mutual interest, including the release of Pakistani nationals imprisoned in Sri Lanka. More than 23,000 Pakistanis are presently detained in foreign prisons, including over 15,000 who have been convicted, according to the Senate Standing Committee on Human Rights. According to the figures, a total of 23,456 Pakistani citizens are imprisoned in various countries, comprising 15,587 convicts and 7,869 under-trial prisoners. The majority of these prisoners are in Saudi Arabia, where 12,156 individuals are detained in various jails. Following closely are the United Arab Emirates (UAE), with 5,292 Pakistani prisoners.

        "date": "October 6, 2024 02:17 pm",
        "content": "Indias ruling party is projected to have lost two key provincial elections to the main opposition Congress party and its allies, exit polls showed, suggesting another setback after the party fared poorly in national elections. Local media reported that Congress had a clear advantage in exit polls in the northern state of Haryana, indicating an end to a decade of rule by Prime Minister Narendra Modis Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the state. The opposition also held an edge in the Himalayan territory of Jammu and Kashmir. The two elections were held in phases that ended on Saturday. Votes will be counted on Tuesday and results will be announced the same day. The exit poll results were released late on Saturday. Exit polls, conducted by private polling firms including TV broadcasters, have a patchy record in India, which analysts say poses a particular challenge due to its large and diverse voting population. The exit polls had projected Modis BJP would win a large majority in the general election in June, but it fell short and had to depend on regional parties to secure a majority and form a coalition government. The two Indian territories are the first to go to the polls since the national elections. Indias industrial hub of Maharashtra and the mineral-rich eastern state of Jharkhand, next up in provincial elections, are awaiting the announcement of poll dates that are expected to be in November. The Jammu and Kashmir election was the first in a decade in the Himalayan region, which has endured years of militant violence. It is Indias only Muslim-majority territory and has been at the centre of a dispute with neighbouring Pakistan since 1947. Its status as a special semi-autonomous entity was revoked in 2019 by Modis government, which says the move has helped to restore normalcy in the area and boosted development.

        "date": "October 6, 2024 05:21 pm",
        "content": "President Anura Kumara Dissanayake announced that the investigations into the Easter Sunday attacks will be expedited, and steps will be taken to ensure that such a tragedy never occurs again in the country. He assured that justice will be delivered to the victims. The President made these remarks during a discussion held today (06) at St. Sebastians Church in Katuwapitiya, Negambo, with the families of those killed and injured in the Easter Sunday attack, the Presidents Media Division (PMD) reported. President Anura Kumara Dissanayake visited the church during the morning and laid floral tributes at the memorial established in honor of the victims. To mark the occasion, a commemorative gift was also presented to the president. During the discussion the President met with the families of the victims, who shared their concerns and difficulties with him directly. He highlighted that the Easter Sunday Attack which happened on 21st April 2019 was the most tragic disaster in the recent past and that it will not be allowed to be buried with time. President Anura Kumara Dissanayake expressed his belief that one of the key factors influencing the peoples decision in the last presidential election was their hope for justice concerning the Easter Sunday attacks. He emphasized that the aspirations of the citizens align with his own, stating that his goal is to deliver the justice and fairness the people seek in relation to the Easter Sunday attack. He assured that efforts have already begun to achieve this, the PMD added. The President also stressed the importance of conducting the investigation without any preconceived conclusions or biases. He instructed the Secretary to the Ministry of Public Security to ensure a transparent and impartial investigation, guided by openness and objectivity. President Anura Kumara Dissanayake acknowledged that there is a widespread belief in society that the Easter Sunday attacks may have been carried out to gain political mileage. He stated that if hundreds of innocent lives were sacrificed for political purposes, it would be a profound tragedy. He emphasized that if politics in the country has reached such an extreme, the first priority must be to eliminate this dangerous situation. The President also highlighted growing suspicions that the government apparatus at the time may have been involved in the attacks. If such allegations are true, he warned, the country would remain in a dangerously unstable and insecure state. Therefore, it is of utmost importance to uncover the truth behind these events, he emphasized. Additionally, President Dissanayake stressed that justice must be delivered to the victims of the tragedy, which claimed the lives of nearly 274 people and left many others injured, to honor the love and devotion of their families. He also expressed his deep appreciation for the role played by the priests, who helped prevent an even greater social catastrophe in the aftermath of the attacks. The President extended his gratitude to them once again for their efforts, it said. President Anura Kumara Dissanayake further stated that if the bonds, trust, and harmony within society are weakened, and people begin to view others with anger and suspicion, it would pose a serious threat to the well-being of the community. In light of this, he emphasized the need for a fair and transparent investigation into the Easter Sunday attacks. The President also noted that for the past five years, those who gathered on the streets on April 21 were driven by a hope for justice, which sustained them year after year. His Eminence Malcolm Cardinal Ranjith, Archbishop of Colombo, speaking at the event, shared that despite appealing to the Human Rights Commission in Geneva for justice for the Easter Sunday victims, no resolution has been achieved. He also pointed out that while the government has been working to provide necessary support to the victims, the public continues to question the true cause of the attack. His Eminence Cardinal Ranjith expressed his belief in President Anura Kumara Dissanayake, acknowledging the trust the people of Sri Lanka have in him and appreciating his integrity. He added that he believes the President will deliver on the promise of justice. He further expressed his belief that the President will take action to hold those responsible for the Easter Sunday attack accountable and ensure justice is served. Rev.Fr. Manjula Niroshan, the mission in charge of Katuwapitiya Church, along with a large number of Easter attack victims and devotees, attended the event, according to the PMD.",

        "date": "October 6, 2024 09:55 pm",
        "content": "An Israeli strike on a mosque in the Gaza Strip early Sunday killed at least 19 people, Palestinian officials said, as Israel intensified its bombardment of northern Gaza and southern Lebanon in a widening war with Iran-allied militant groups across the region. Israel still battles Hamas a year after the groups Oct. 7 attack on Israel, and has opened a new front in Lebanon against Hezbollah, which has traded fire with Israel along the border since the war in Gaza began. Israel has vowed to strike Iran itself after Tehran launched a ballistic missile attack on Israel last week. The widening conflict risks further drawing in the United States, which has provided crucial military and diplomatic support to Israel. Iran-allied militant groups in Syria, Iraq and Yemen have joined in with long-distance strikes on Israel. A stabbing and shooting attack at the central bus station in the southern Israeli city of Beersheba left one person dead and 10 wounded, according to first responders. Police said the woman killed was a border police officer. They did not identify the assailant but said they were treating it as a terror attack. Israel is on high alert ahead of memorial events for the Oct. 7 attack, while rallies continue around the world marking the anniversary. Israeli issues new evacuation orders in northern Gaza The Israeli strike hit a mosque where displaced people sheltered near the main hospital in the central Gaza town of Deir al-Balah. Another four were killed in a strike on a school-turned-shelter near the town. The Israeli military said both strikes targeted militants, without providing evidence. An Associated Press journalist counted the bodies at the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital morgue. Hospital records showed that those killed at the mosque were all men. The Israeli military announced a new air and ground offensive in Jabaliya, in northern Gaza, home to a refugee camp dating back to the 1948 war surrounding Israels creation. Israel has carried out several large operations there during the past year, only to see militants regroup. The military said three soldiers were severely wounded in Sundays fighting in northern Gaza. Israel reiterated its call, from the early weeks of the war, for the complete evacuation of northern Gaza. Up to 300,000 people are estimated to have remained in the heavily destroyed north while around a million fled to the south. We are in a new phase of the war, the military said in leaflets dropped over the area. These areas are considered dangerous combat zones. A later statement said three projectiles were identified crossing from northern Gaza into Israeli territory, with no injuries reported. Palestinians reported heavy Israeli strikes. The Civil Defense first responders operating under the Hamas-run government said it recovered three bodies, including a woman and a child, after a strike hit a home in the Shati refugee camp. Residents mourned relatives. Imad Alarabid said on Facebook an airstrike on his Jabaliya home killed a dozen family members, including his parents. Saeed Abu Elaish, a Health Ministry medic, said he was wounded. Pray for us, he wrote on Facebook. Hassan Hamd, a freelance TV journalist whose footage had aired on Al Jazeera, was killed in shelling on his home in Jabaliya. Anas al-Sharif, an Al Jazeera reporter in northern Gaza, confirmed his death. Israels military says it has expanded the so-called humanitarian zone in southern Gaza. Hundreds of thousands of people have sought refuge in sprawling tent camps there with little food, water or toilets. Israel has carried out strikes in the zone against what it says are militants hiding among civilians. Nearly 42,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since the start of the war, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. It does not say how many were fighters, but says a little over half were women and children. Hamas-led militants killed some 1,200 people in the Oct. 7 attack and took another 250 hostage. They still hold around 100 captives, a third of whom are believed to be dead. Israel bombards southern Beirut In Beirut, airstrikes lit up the skyline and explosions echoed across the southern suburbs, known as the Dahiyeh, overnight as Israel struck what it said were Hezbollah militant sites. It was the heaviest bombardment since Sept. 23, when Israel escalated its air campaign. Lebanons state-run National News Agency said the area was hit by more than 30 strikes. Yesterday was a tragic night; it was very difficult. All of us in Beirut could hear everything, resident Haytham Al-Darazi said. Another resident, Maxime Jawad, called it a night of terror. Targets included a gas station on the main highway leading to the Beirut airport and a warehouse for medical supplies, the news agency said. Some strikes set off a series of explosions, suggesting that ammunition stores were hit. Israels military confirmed it was striking targets near Beirut and said about 130 projectiles had crossed from Lebanon into Israeli territory, with some intercepted. Hezbollah said it successfully targeted a group of Israeli soldiers in northern Israel with a large rocket salvo, hitting them accurately. It is not possible to verify battlefield reports from either side. At least 1,400 Lebanese, including civilians, medics and Hezbollah fighters, have been killed and 1.2 million driven from their homes in less than two weeks. Israel says it aims to drive the militant group away from its border so that tens of thousands of Israeli citizens can return home. Hezbollah, the strongest armed force in Lebanon, began firing rockets into Israel almost immediately after Hamas Oct. 7 attack, calling it a show of support for the Palestinians. Hezbollah and Israels military have traded fire almost daily. Last week, Israel launched what it said was a limited ground operation into southern Lebanon after a series of attacks killed longtime Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and most of his top commanders. The fighting is the worst since Israel and Hezbollah fought a month-long war in 2006. Nine Israeli soldiers have been killed in ground clashes that Israel says have killed 440 Hezbollah fighters. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited a military base near the border on Sunday and called soldiers the generation of victory. Macron seeks partial arms embargo on Israel French President Emmanuel Macron on Sunday reiterated his call for a partial arms embargo on Israel a demand that prompted an angry response from Netanyahu. In a statement, Macrons office said he favors a halt to arms exports for use in Gaza because a cease-fire is needed to stop the mounting violence and clear the way to the political solutions needed for the security of Israel and the whole Middle East. Macrons earlier, similar remarks led Netanyahu to release a statement in which he referred to such calls as a disgrace. Macrons office insisted that France is Israels unfailing friend and called Netanyahus remarks excessive. Later Sunday, Netanyahus office said the two leaders had spoken and agreed to promote a dialogue on the matter. Source: AP --Agencies",

Police and the provincial government said a tanker exploded outside the airport, which is Pakistans biggest. A Chinese Embassy statement said that a convoy carrying Chinese staff of the Port Qasim Electric Power Company (Private) Limited had been attacked around 11 p.m., killing two Chinese and injuring one other. It said there were Pakistani casualties as well. The provincial home minister, Zia Ul Hassan, told local TV station Geo that the explosion was an attack targeting foreigners. Thousands of Chinese workers are in Pakistan, most of them involved in Beijings multibillion-dollar Belt and Road Initiative that connects south and central Asia with the Chinese capital. Videos showed flames engulfing cars and a thick column of smoke rising from the scene. There was a heavy military deployment at the site, which was cordoned off. The Chinese statement called the explosion a terrorist attack and said that China is working with Pakistan to handle the aftermath. It called for a thorough investigation to punish the perpetrators and reminded Chinese citizens in the country to take safety precautions. The Chinese Embassy and Consulates General in Pakistan strongly condemn this terrorist attack (and) express deep condolences to the innocent victims of both countries, the statement said. Deputy Inspector General East Azfar Mahesar told media that it seemed like it was an oil tanker explosion. We are determining the nature and reasons for the blast. It takes time. Police officers were among the injured, he added. The home minister and inspector general also visited the blast site, but they did not talk to the media.

As a result, he and others were ordered to pay compensation to the victims of the Easter Sunday attacks. The Supreme Court ordered former President Sirisena to pay Rs. 100 million in compensation to the petitioners, former IGP Pujith Jayasundara and the former SIS Director Nilantha Jayawardena were each ordered to pay Rs. 75 million, former Defense Secretary Hemasiri Fernando was ordered to pay Rs. 50 million and former National Intelligence Director Sisira Mendis was ordered to pay Rs. 10 million from their personal money. On September 27, the Attorney General informed the Supreme Court that contempt of court charges would be filed against Nilantha Jayawardana, for failing to pay the Rs. 75 million in compensation for the Easter Sunday bomb victims as ordered by the court. Accordingly, the Supreme Court has ordered him to appear before the court on today. The 12 petitions were filed by a group of individuals including Nandana Sirimanna, whose two children were killed in the Easter Sunday attacks, tourism entrepreneur Janath Vidanage, three Catholic Fathers including Rev. Fr. Sarath Iddamalgoda and Attorney-at-Law Moditha Ekanayake, who was injured in the bombings at the Shangri-La Hotel.

        "title": "Joker 2 stumbles at box office amid poor reviews from audiences and critics",
        "date": "October 7, 2024 10:41 am",
        "content": "Joker: Folie à Deux is the No. 1 movie at the box office, but it might not be destined for a happy ending. In a turn of events that only Arthur Fleck would find funny, the follow-up to Todd Phillips 2019 origin story about the Batman villain opened in theaters nationwide this weekend to a muted 40 million, according to studio estimates Sunday, less than half that of its predecessor. The collapse was swift and has many in the industry wondering: How did the highly anticipated sequel to an Oscar-winning, billion-dollar film with the same creative team go wrong? Just three weeks ago, tracking services pegged the movie for a 70 million debut, which would still have been down a fair amount from Jokers record-breaking 96.2 million launch in Oct. 2019. Reviews were mixed out of the Venice Film Festival, where it premiered in competition like the first movie and even got a 12-minute standing ovation. But the homecoming glow was short-lived, and the fragile foundation would crumble in the coming weeks with its Rotten Tomatoes score dropping from 63 at Venice to 33 by its first weekend in theaters. Perhaps even more surprising were the audience reviews: Ticket buyers polled on opening night gave the film a deadly D CinemaScore. Exit polls from PostTrak werent any better. It got a meager half star out of five possible. Thats a double whammy thats very difficult to recover from, said Paul Dergarabedian, the senior media analyst for Comscore. The biggest issue of all is the reported budget. A 40 or 50 million opening for a less expensive movie would be a solid debut. Joker: Folie à Deux cost at least twice as much as the first film to produce, though reported figures vary at exactly how pricey it was to make. Phillips told Variety that it was less than the reported 200 million; Others have it pegged at 190 million. Warner Bros. released the film in 4,102 locations in North America. About 12.5 of its domestic total came from 415 IMAX screens. Internationally, its earned 81.1 million from 25,788 screens, bringing its total global earnings estimate to 121.1 million. In the next two weeks, Joker 2 will also open in Japan and China. Second place went to Universal and DreamWorks AnimationsThe Wild Robot, which added 18.7 million in its second weekend, bringing its domestic total to nearly 64 million. Globally, its made over 100 million. Warner Bros. Beetlejuice Beetlejuice took third place in weekend five, Paramounts Transformers One landed in fourth and Universal and Blumhouses Speak No Evil rounded out the top five. The other big new release of the weekend, Lionsgates White Bird, flopped with just 1.5 million from just over 1,000 locations, despite an A CinemaScore. Overall, the weekend is up from the same frame last year, but Jokers start is an unwelcome twist for theater owners hoping to narrow the box office deficit. Phillips and star Joaquin Phoenix have said they aspired to make something as audacious as the first film. The sequel added Lady Gaga into the fold, as a Joker superfan, and delved further into the mind of Arthur Fleck, imprisoned at Arkham and awaiting trial for the murders he committed in the first. Its also a musical, with elaborately imagined song and dance numbers to old standards. Gaga even released a companion album called Harlequin, alongside the film. In his review for The Associated Press, Jake Coyle wrote that Phillips has followed his very antihero take on the Joker with a very anti-sequel. It combines prison drama, courthouse thriller and musical, and yet turns out remarkably inert given how combustible the original was. The sequel has already been the subject of many think pieces, some who posit that the sequel was deliberately alienating fans of the first movie. In cruder terms, its been called a middle finger. But fans often ignore the advice of critics, especially when it comes to opening their wallets to see revered comic book characters on the big screen. They took a swing for the fences, Dergarabedian said. But except for a couple of outliers, audiences in 2024 seem to want to know what theyre getting when theyre going to the theater. They want the tried and true, the familiar. It has some high-profile defenders too: Francis Ford Coppola, who last week got his own D CinemaScore for his pricey, ambitious and divisive film Megalopolis, entered the Joker chat with an Instagram post. ToddPhillips films always amaze me and I enjoy them thoroughly, Coppola wrote. Ever since the wonderful The Hangover hes always one step ahead of the audience never doing what they expect. Megalopolis, meanwhile, dropped a terminal 74 in its second weekend with just over 1 million, bringing its total just shy of 6.5 million against a 120 million budget. Deadline editor Anthony DAlessandro thinks the problem started with the idea to make the Joker sequel a musical. No fan of the original movie wanted to see a musical sequel, he wrote on Saturday. The first film was also divisive and the subject of much discourse, then about whether it might send the wrong message to the wrong type of person. And yet people still flocked to see what the fuss was about. Joker went on to pick up 11 Oscar nominations, including best picture and best director, and three wins. It also made over 1 billion and was the highest-grossing R-rated film of all time, until this summer when Marvels Deadpool  Wolverine took the crown. Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore. Final domestic figures will be released Monday. 1. Joker: Folie à Deux, 40 million. 2. The Wild Robot, 18.7 million. 3. Beetlejuice Beetlejuice, 10.3 million. 4. Transformers One, 5.4 million. 5. Speak No Evil, 2.8 million. 6. Sam and Colby: The Legends of Paranormal, 1.8 million. 7. White Bird, 1.5 million. 8. Deadpool  Wolverine, 1.5 million. 9. The Substance, 1.3 million. 10. Megalopolis, 1.1 million. Source: AP --Agencies",

        "content": "The Legal Counsel of former Director of the State Intelligence Service (SIS) Nilantha Jayawardena has informed the Supreme Court that the arrears of the compensation his client was ordered to pay pertaining to the Easter Sunday attacks will be settled and the relevant documentation will be submitted to the court later today (07). The former Senior DIG and head of the SIS, Nilantha Jayawardana, appeared before the Supreme Court in relation to the contempt of court charges filed against him, for failing to complete the payment of Rs. 75 million in compensation for the Easter Sunday bomb victims as ordered by the court. The relevant case was taken up before a seven-member Supreme Court judge bench led by Chief Justice Jayantha Jayasuriya this morning. During the trial, Presidents Counsel Chandaka Jayasundara, who appeared for defendant Jayawardena stated before the court that since his client is an active duty police officer, he is not in a position to demand money from outside parties for payment of the compensation.

        "date": "October 7, 2024 12:36 pm",
        "content": "The Director of the Planning Division of the National Institute of Education (NIE) in Maharagama and the school teacher, who were arrested by the Criminal Investigations Department (CID) over the Grade 5 scholarship examination question paper issue, have been ordered to be remanded until October 22. This order was issued after the arrested 58-year-old NIE Director, who was a member of the committee which prepared the 2024 Grade 05 Scholarship Examination paper, and the 49-year-old teacher who had been conducting tuition classes, were produced before the Kaduwela Magistrates Court, Ada Derana reporter said. On September 20, an investigation was launched by the Department of Examinations after it was alleged that a question paper from the exam had been leaked. Later, the initial investigation report has been handed over to the Criminal Investigation Department (CID), which is currently conducting further inquiries. Meanwhile, the Secretary of the Ministry of Education, Thilaka Jayasundara, announced that the paper marking process of the Grade 5 Scholarship Examination, which was held on September 15, has been temporarily suspended, owing to the issue. Furthermore, the Education Ministry said the decision on whether to hold the Grade 5 Scholarship Examination again or not will be made after the CID and the Exams Department complete their investigations into the alleged leaking of questions. The decision will be based on the findings and recommendations of the relevant investigations, according to the Ministry Secretary. The Commissioner General of Examinations Amit Jayasundara said that investigations are being held into an incident where three questions similar to those on the Grade 5 Scholarship exam paper had allegedly been posted online via a model exam paper. He had also stated that if investigations uncover that the questions have in fact been leaked, the relevant questions would be disregarded during the paper marking process. He revealed that an investigation was conducted based on the information received alleging that a teacher in the Alawwa area had uploaded a model question paper to social media which had included three questions similar to three questions in the first paper of the Grade 5 Scholarship Exam. However, the parents have requested that the President to consider holding a re-examination for the first paper of the Grade 5 Scholarship Examination, as they claimed eight questions, and not three, were leaked prior to the exam. Against this backdrop, Sri Lanka Police has informed that anyone with evidence or knowledge of any exam questions, other than the three questions already alleged to have been leaked, being disclosed prior to the 2024 Scholarship Examination, to come forward with complaints by today (07). This years scholarship exam was held at 2,849 centers across the island, with 323,879 candidates participating.",

        "date": "October 7, 2024 12:39 pm",
        "content": "The World Bank and the Government of Sri Lanka today signed the Second Resilience, Stability, and Economic Turnaround (RESET) Development Policy Operation (DPO) for 200 million. This is the second operation in a two-part series that began in 2022. The first operation, totaling 500 million, was disbursed in June and December 2023. The Second RESET DPO aims to support reforms that improve economic governance, enhance growth and competitiveness, and protect the poor and vulnerable, helping to build Sri Lankas resilience and fostering an equitable economy. The operation focuses on improving economic governance to create a stable macroeconomic environment and restore investor confidence through key reforms. These include enacting a new Public Debt Management Act to better inform borrowing decisions, implementing tax administration reforms to boost revenues, and addressing financial sector risks by tightening single borrower limits and improving mechanisms for resolving non-performing loans. To improve living standards and boost private sector development, the operation includes amendments to the Telecommunications Act and a new Electricity Act to improve services in these markets, as well as measures to enhance export competitiveness by phasing out para-tariffs and lowering customs duties. Central to the operation is the protection of the poor and vulnerable. This will be achieved by revitalizing the social protection system to help the poor and vulnerable cope with the lasting effects of the economic crisis and price adjustments resulting from macro-fiscal reforms. Enhancing womens empowerment and reducing gender discrimination to promote higher and more sustainable growth in Sri Lanka is another key feature. We are very proud of the excellent collaboration with the authorities and their steadfast dedication to addressing the needs of the Sri Lankan economy. This operation represents support for critical reforms over the past two years, which were central to economic stabilization, said David Sislen, World Bank Regional Country Director for Maldives, Nepal, and Sri Lanka. Moving forward, Sri Lanka will now have the opportunity to focus on maintaining its hard-earned stability and investing in the private sector to transform the national growth trajectory. Doing so is vital to boosting economic growth, creating jobs, and ensuring that everyone benefits from a stronger, more resilient economy.",

        "date": "October 7, 2024 02:19 pm",
        "content": "Israelis were holding vigils and somber ceremonies on Monday to mark a year since the Oct. 7, 2023 Hamas attack, the deadliest in the countrys history, which sparked the war in Gaza and scarred Israelis indelibly. The surprise cross-border attack, which caught Israel unprepared on a major Jewish holiday, shattered Israelis sense of security and shook their faith in their leaders and their military. Its aftershocks still ripple one year later. The war in Gaza rages on and Israel is fighting a new war against Hezbollah, which began attacking Israel on Oct. 8. There is also an escalating conflict with Iran which backs both Hamas and Hezbollah militant groups that threatens to drag the region into a far more dangerous conflagration. And on Monday, Hamas showed that it was still putting up a fight. It launched rockets that set off air raid sirens in Tel Aviv, as well as closer to the Gaza border. In Gaza, which is still buckling under the weight of the ongoing war, no formal commemorative event is planned. The massive destruction and displacement are a constant reminder of the retaliatory Israeli assault on the territory, which has no end in sight. Israelis were flocking to ceremonies, cemeteries and memorial sites around the country, remembering the hundreds of victims, the dozens of hostages still in captivity and the soldiers wounded or killed trying to save them. At 6:29 a.m. the exact minute Hamas launched its attack the families of those killed at the Nova music festival, joined by Israeli President Isaac Herzog, gathered at the site where almost 400 revelers were gunned down and from where many others were taken hostage. After briefly playing the same trance music that was blared during the festival, hundreds of family members and friends of the victims stood for a moment of silence. One womans piercing wail broke the silence as booms echoed from the fighting in Gaza, just a few kilometers away. When we are here, we are near our loved ones. This is the time they danced and fled, said Sigal Bar-On, whose niece, Yuval Bar-On, 25, and her fiancé Moshe Shuva, 34, were supposed to get married in December 2023. At 6:31 a.m., four projectiles were launched from Gaza toward the very Israeli communities that came under fierce assault last year, the Israeli military said. The ceremony was not disrupted. Marking the moment Hamas attack began a year ago, the families of hostages still held in Gaza about 100, a third of whom are said to be dead gathered near Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahus Jerusalem residence and stood during a two-minute siren, replicating a custom from the the most solemn dates on the Israeli calendar, Holocaust Remembrance and Memorial Day. We are here to remind (the hostages) that we havent forgotten them, said Shiri Albag, whose daughter Liri is among the captives. Her message to Netanyahu: We wont let you rest until all of them are back, every last one of them, she told the crowd, which hoisted posters bearing the faces of the hostages. A group representing the families of hostages announced that another captive was dead. Idan Shtivi, 28, was snatched from the Nova music festival and was believed to be alive. Israeli media reported he was killed during the attack and his body was taken into Gaza. The flags at the Israeli Knesset were lowered to half-staff and an official state ceremony focusing on acts of bravery and hope is set to be aired on Monday evening. The ceremony was prerecorded without an audience apparently to avoid potential disruptions in the southern city of Ofakim, where over two dozen Israelis were killed. But anger at the governments failure to prevent the attack and enduring frustration that it has not returned the remaining hostages prompted the families of those killed and taken captive to hold a separate event in Tel Aviv. That event had been set to draw tens of thousands of people but was scaled back drastically over prohibitions on large gatherings due to the threat of missile attacks from Iran and Hezbollah. Hamas attack, which killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and dragged some 250 into Gaza as hostages, continues to cast a shadow over daily life in Israel. For the dozens of hostages still in captivity, there is no end in sight to their struggle. Border communities have been upended and tens of thousands were displaced. Soldiers are being killed in Gaza and Lebanon. Israel faces ongoing international criticism over its wartime conduct, with two world courts examining its actions. The war in Gaza has killed more than 41,000 Palestinians, displaced most of the territorys 2.3 million population and sparked a humanitarian crisis that has led to widespread hunger. It has also left the tiny coastal enclave ravaged beyond recognition as U.S.-led cease-fire efforts have repeatedly sputtered. Source: AP --Agencies",

        "date": "October 7, 2024 03:48 pm",
        "content": "Police have arrested the suspected shooter in the killing of a 55-year-old businessman who was shot dead in the Neluwattuduwa area of Hanwella on September 30, allegedly due to a dispute over failure to pay ransom. The incident occurred at around 8.15 p.m. on September 30, and the victim, identified as Vajira Nishantha, succumbed to his injuries after being admitted to Avissawella Hospital in critical condition, according to Police Spokesman DIG Nihal Thalduwa. The shooter, who carried out the attack inside the victims home, has been arrested, police confirmed. Authorities suspect the gunman used a T56 assault rifle to commit the murder. CCTV cameras had captured the moment the suspect jumped over the houses wall, fired the fatal shots, and fled the scene. Police believe that the killing was orchestrated by underworld figure Lalith Kannangara, who is currently in hiding in Dubai. Kannangara had reportedly demanded ransom from several businessmen in the area, including the deceased. Fearing for their safety, many of these businessmen have since fled their homes and refused to speak to the media due to threats issued by Kannangara, police said. The victims home had been targeted before, with a shooting incident in 2021 and his business premises were set on fire. Despite receiving multiple death threats from Kannangara due to non-payment of the ransom, the businessman had not complied with the demands. Police revealed that Kannangara became enraged after the victim failed to respond to his phone calls. The Colombo-South Crimes Division is conducting further investigations regarding the incident. Police have further disclosed that the victim had previously helped Kannangara when he first arrived in Colombo to work as a bus conductor, even assisting him in obtaining a drivers license.",

        "content": "U.S. scientists Victor Ambros and Gary Ruvkun won the 2024 Nobel Prize in Medicine for the discovery of microRNA and its crucial role in how multicellular organisms grow and live, the award-giving body said on Monday. The Nobel assembly said in a statement that the laureates discovered the new class of tiny RNA molecules, which play a crucial role in gene regulation. Their groundbreaking discovery revealed a completely new principle of gene regulation that turned out to be essential for multicellular organisms, including humans, the assembly said. Their work helped explain how cells specialise and develop into different types, such as muscle and nerve cells, even though all the cells in an individual contain the same set of genes and instructions for growing and staying alive. Thomas Perlmann, secretary of the Nobel committee for physiology, said he had reached Ruvkun by phone, waking him up early in the U.S. morning, but he was eventually happy and very enthusiastic. He had not yet reached Ambros, he said. (Ruvkuns) wife answered. It took a long time till he came to the phone and he was very tired, Perlmann said at a press conference. Ambros is a professor at the University of Massachusetts Medical School, while Ruvkun is a professor at Harvard Medical School and also affiliated with Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. FIRST OF 2024 NOBEL PRIZES The winners of the prize for physiology or medicine are selected by the Nobel Assembly of Swedens Karolinska Institute medical university and receive a prize sum of 11 million Swedish crowns (1.1 million). As every year, the physiology or medicine prize is the first in the crop of Nobels, arguably the most prestigious prizes in science, literature and humanitarian endeavour, with the remaining five set to be unveiled over the coming days. Created in the will of Swedish dynamite inventor and businessman Alfred Nobel, the prizes have been awarded for breakthroughs in science, literature and peace since 1901, while economics is a later addition. Different institutions award the prizes in the various fields, with Peace being the only one awarded in Oslo rather than Stockholm, possibly as a result of the political union that existed between the two Nordic countries when Nobel penned his will. Past winners of the Nobel medicine prize include many famous researchers such as Ivan Pavlov in 1904, most known for his experiments on behaviour using dogs, and Alexander Fleming, who shared the 1945 prize for the discovery of penicillin. Last years medicine prize was awarded to the runaway favourites Katalin Kariko, a Hungarian scientist, and U.S. colleague Drew Weissman, for discoveries that paved the way for COVID-19 vaccines that helped curb the pandemic. Steeped in tradition, the science, literature and economics prizes are presented to the laureates in a ceremony on Dec. 10, the anniversary of Alfred Nobels death, followed by a lavish banquet at Stockholm city hall. Separate festivities attend the winner of the peace prize in Oslo on the same day. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "date": "October 7, 2024 04:28 pm",
        "content": "A Russian court on Monday sentenced a 72-year-old American in a closed trial to nearly seven years in prison for allegedly fighting as a mercenary in Ukraine. Prosecutors said Stephen Hubbard signed a contract with the Ukrainian military after Russia sent troops into Ukraine in February 2022 and he fought alongside them until being captured two months later. He was sentenced to six years and 10 months in a general-security prison. Prosecutors had called for a sentence of seven years in a maximum-security prison. Hubbard, from the state of Michigan, is the first American known to have been convicted on charges of fighting as a mercenary in the Ukrainian conflict. The charges carried a potential sentence of 15 years, but prosecutors asked that his age be taken into account along with his admission of guilt, Russian news reports said. Arrests of Americans have become increasingly common in Russia in recent years. Concern has risen that Russia could be targeting U.S. nationals for arrest to use later as bargaining chips in talks to bring back Russians convicted of crimes in the U.S. and Europe. Also on Monday, a court in the city of Voronezh sentenced American Robert Gilman to seven years and 1 month for allegedly assaulting law enforcement officers while serving a sentence for another assault. According to Russian news reports, Gilman was arrested in 2022 for causing a disturbance while intoxicated on a passenger train and then assaulted a police officer while in custody. He is serving a 3 12-year sentence on that charge. Last year, he assaulted a prison inspector during a cell check, then hit an official of the Investigative Committe, resulting in the new sentence, state news agency RIA-Novosti said. The U.S. and Russia in August completed their largest prisoner swap in post-Soviet history, a deal involving 24 people, many months of negotiations and concessions from other European countries, which released Russians in their custody as part of the exchange. Several U.S. citizens remain behind bars in Russia following the swap. Source: AP --Agencies",

        "date": "October 7, 2024 07:08 pm",
        "content": "The International Cricket Council (ICC) today named the shortlists for Septembers ICC Player of the Month awards, celebrating the outstanding individual performances that took place across a bumper month of action in international cricket. The ICC Mens Player of the Month candidates include three previous Player of the Month winners aiming to secure their second prize - two Sri Lankan Test stars, and a multi-format maestro from Australia. Travis Head aims to win his second ICC Mens Player of the Month award after excelling with bat and ball in the shorter formats against Scotland and England in September. Joining him on the shortlist for the monthly award is Sri Lankan pair Prabath Jayasuriya and Kamindu Mendis. Jayasuriya shone with the spinning ball, while Mendis celebrated another set of landmarks with strong performances in their World Test Championship outings against England and New Zealand. The shortlist for the ICC Womens Player of the Month award pairs two experienced runscorers from England and the UAE with a promising Irish spinner. Prabath Jayasuriya (SL) Another former winner of the Mens Player of the Month award back in July 2022, Jayasuriya was a consistently threatening presence in the Sri Lankan bowling lineup during September. He took three wickets in the second Test defeat against England, yet saved his best individual performances for the visit of New Zealand to Galle. He claimed the Player of the Match award for nine wickets in the first Test, which included a pivotal five-for in the second innings to hold off the Blackcaps charge, and took another nine wickets in the second Test, highlighted by six for 42 in the first innings. Kamindu Mendis (SL) The 26-year-old has made plenty of headlines in 2024, and continues his record-breaking form in the longest format after a landmark September which included 451 runs at an average of 90.20 in four Tests. A half-century in the final Test victory over England preceded century scores of 114 and 182 not out respectively in the two Tests against New Zealand, making Mendis the first player to pass fifty in each of his first eight Tests, and the fastest batter in 75 years to reach 1,000 Test runs. Travis Head (AUS) The Australian all-rounder aims to win his second ICC Player of the Month award after 430 runs and six wickets in short format series in Scotland and England in September. The 30-year-old, having previously won in November 2023, began the month blasting 80 from 25 balls as Australia blew Scotland away in the first of three T20Is in Edinburgh. Two subdued performances followed, before returning to form as they crossed the border. Scores of 59 and 31 in T20Is were followed by strong performances in the ODI format, with Head claiming the Player of the Series accolade thanks to an unbeaten 154 and two wickets in Nottingham, and four wickets in the decisive victory in Bristol. ICC Womens Player of the Month Nominees for September: Tammy Beaumont (ENG) Evergreen England batter Beaumont also aims to win her second Player of the Month award after her sole previous success came in February 2021. The 33-year-old recorded 279 runs from her five matches in September, which included three ODIs and two T20Is against a spirited Ireland side. A blistering performance in the second ODI encounter in Belfast saw Beaumont smash an unbeaten 150 in 139 balls atop the order, as England sealed the series win with a statement victory. Another ODI half-century followed in the next match, before scores of 27 and 40 in the drawn T20I series wrapped up her tour. Aimee Maguire (IRE) 18-year-old Maguire has made an impressive start to her international career since her debut last year, and hit the headlines in September after inspiring Irelands first ODI victory over England since 2001. The left-arm spinner claimed career-best figures of five for 19 in the third match, taking the prized wickets of Beaumont and Kate Cross to restrict the tourists and set up a famous win. Not done there, the youngster starred during the subsequent T20I matches, taking five more wickets across two matches at an average of 12.40. Esha Oza (UAE) UAE skipper Oza secures her second nomination in the ICC Womens Player of the Month awards after Player of the Series endeavours in the UAEs Capricorn Womens Tri-Series triumph in Namibia. The all-rounder registered 209 runs and eight wickets from six T20I matches in September, highlighted by a fine display in their third match (42 and three for 29 against Namibia), and 84 in the following victory over Zimbabwe. The ICC Player of the Month Voting Process: The three nominees for either category are shortlisted based on performances from the first to the last day of each calendar month. The shortlist is then voted on by the independent ICC Voting Academy and fans around the world. The ICC Voting Academy comprises prominent members of the cricket fraternity including well-known journalists, former players, broadcasters and members of the ICC Hall of Fame. The Voting Academy submit their votes by email and hold a 90 per cent share of the vote. Fans registered with the ICC can vote via the ICC website, accounting for the remaining 10 per cent. Winners are announced every second Monday of the month on ICCs digital channels. --ICC--",

        "date": "October 8, 2024 12:13 pm",
        "content": "Powerful criminal networks in Southeast Asia extensively use the messaging app Telegram which has enabled a fundamental change in the way organised crime can conduct large-scale illicit activity, the United Nations said in a report on Monday. The report represents the latest allegations to be levied against the controversial encrypted app since France, using a tough new law with no international equivalent, charged its boss Pavel Durov for allowing criminal activity on the platform. Hacked data including credit card details, passwords and browser history are openly traded on a vast scale on the app which has sprawling channels with little moderation, the report by the United Nations Office for Drugs and Crime (UNODC) said. Tools used for cybercrime, including so-called deepfake software designed for fraud, and data-stealing malware are also widely sold, while unlicensed cryptocurrency exchanges offer money laundering services, according to the report. We move 3 million USDT stolen from overseas per day, the report quoted one ad as saying in Chinese. There is strong evidence of underground data markets moving to Telegram and vendors actively looking to target transnational organized crime groups based in Southeast Asia, the report said. Southeast Asia has emerged as a major hub for a multibillion-dollar industry that targets victims across the world with fraudulent schemes. Many are Chinese syndicates that operate from fortified compounds staffed by trafficked workers. The industry generates between 27.4 billion to 36.5 billion annually, UNODC said. Russian-born Durov was arrested in Paris in August and charged with allowing criminal activity on the platform including the spread of sexual images of children. The move has put the spotlight on the criminal liability of app providers and also triggered debate on where freedom of speech ends and enforcement of the law begins. Telegram, which has close to 1 billion users, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Following his arrest, Durov, who is currently out on bail, said the app would hand over users IP addresses and phone numbers to authorities making legal requests. He also said the app would remove some features that have been abused for illegal activity. Benedikt Hofmann, UNODCs deputy representative for Southeast Asia and the Pacific, said the app was an easily navigable environment for criminals. For consumers, this means their data is at a higher risk of being fed into scams or other criminal activity than ever before, he told Reuters. The report said the sheer scale of the profits earned by criminal groups in the region had required them to innovate, adding they had integrated new business models and technologies including malware, generative artificial intelligence and deepfakes into their operations. UNODC said it had identified more than 10 deepfake software service providers specifically targeting criminal groups involved in cyberenabled fraud in Southeast Asia. Elsewhere in Asia, police in South Korea - estimated to be the country most targeted by deepfake pornography - have reportedly launched an investigation into Telegram that will look at whether it abets online sex crimes. Reuters also reported last month that a hacker had used chatbots on Telegram to leak the data of top Indian insurer Star Health, prompting the insurer to sue the platform. Using the chatbots, Reuters was able to download policy and claims documents featuring names, phone numbers, addresses, tax details, copies of ID cards, test results and medical diagnoses.

        "date": "October 8, 2024 01:19 pm",
        "content": "The Singham Again trailer is finally here! Ending fans long wait, the team behind the multi-starrer released the trailer on Monday, October 7. Directed by Rohit Shetty, the actioner has a stellar star cast comprising big names like Ajay Devgn, Kareena Kapoor, Akshay Kumar, Deepika Padukone, Ranveer Singh, Jackie Shroff, Arjun Kapoor, and Tiger Shroff among others. Slated for a Diwali release, Singham Again comes 10 years after Singham Returns. While the trailer has scorched social media, a particular sequence stands out amidst all the car action scenes, gun-trotting cops, and numerous popular faces. And that is when Ajay Devgns character visits a temple in Sri Lanka. The Sri Lankan Temple Shown In Singham Again Is Unique In the scene, which comes around 3:22 minutes, we see Ajay Devgn visiting a temple while a female voiceover says that this is the only temple in Sri Lanka where Sita Maa is worshipped. She adds that wherever Lord Hanuman set his foot on this temple ground, we can see the imprints, and the lore goes that this is one among them, as the trailer focuses on a giant footprint on the ground near Sita Maas temple. A little research reveals the temples name as Seetha Amman Temple, Seetha Eliya Seethai Amman Thirukkovil, or Ashok Vatika Sita Temple, and it exists. Located in Nuwara Eliya, Central Sri Lanka, the temple has a Tamil architecture style. It is believed that after the abduction, Sita was brought to this location by King Ravana of Lanka. The soil in the temple area is black, which as per the epic of Ramayana, happened because Lord Hanuman charred the area before leaving Sri Lanka. Theres also a stream near the Seetha Amman Temple, where Sita Devi bathed and fulfilled other daily needs. The Temple Has No Entrance Fee Roughly 2km southeast of this temple, theres the Hakgala Botanical Garden, believed to have been created by Ravana for Sita. The garden attracts tourists and believers all year round who visit there to honour her patience and endurance. There is no fee to visit the temple but if one wants to take part in a puja or service, they must purchase a ticket for around100200 Sri Lankan Rupees. Puja timing is from 8am to 1pm and from 2pm to 6.30pm. Singham Again is set to hit cinema halls on November 1, 2024. Source: HerZindagi --Agencies",

        "content": "Scientists John Hopfield and Geoffrey Hinton won the 2024 Nobel Prize in Physics for discoveries and inventions that enable machine learning within artificial neural networks, the award-giving body said on Tuesday. The award comes with a prize sum of 11 million Swedish crowns (1.1 million), which is shared between the winners if there are several. The physics prize is awarded by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. This years two Nobel Laureates in physics have used tools from physics to develop methods that are the foundation of todays powerful machine learning, the award-giving body said in a statement. Widely considered the most prestigious prize for physicists across the world, it was created, along with awards for achievements in science, literature and peace, in the will of Alfred Nobel. The prizes have been awarded with a few interruptions since 1901, though the Nobel economics honour is a later addition in memory of the Swedish businessman and philanthropist, who had made a fortune from his invention of dynamite. Outside the sometimes controversial choices for peace and literature, physics often makes the biggest splash among the prizes, with the list of past winners featuring scientific superstars such as Albert Einstein, Niels Bohr and Enrico Fermi. Last years physics prize was awarded to Pierre Agostini, Ferenc Krausz and Anne LHuillier for their work in creating ultra-short pulses of light that can give a snapshot of changes within atoms, potentially improving the detection of diseases. Physics is the second Nobel to be awarded this week, after U.S. scientists Victor Ambros and Gary Ruvkun won the medicine prize for their discovery of microRNA and its role in gene regulation, shedding light on how cells specialise.

        "date": "October 8, 2024 04:29 pm",
        "content": "India has agreed to extend hundreds of millions of dollars in financial support to the Maldives to help strengthen its struggling economy. The deal was announced after Maldives President Mohammed Muizzu held talks with Prime Minister Narendra Modi during his five-day visit to India. The support includes a 400m currency swap deal and an additional 30bn rupees (357m; 273m) in another swap agreement which will allow companies to do business in local currencies rather than in US dollars. The Maldivian president was given red carpet treatment after relations soured in recent months. Modi called his visit a new chapter in ties. India will always be there for the progress and prosperity of the people of Maldives, he said. The statements - and the Indian financial package - signal a significant improvement in relations between Male and Delhi, which have been strained since Muizzu came to power in November 2023. Soon after taking over, he chose to travel to Turkey and China - his visit to the latter in January was seen especially as a high-profile snub to India as previous Maldivian leaders traditionally visited Delhi first after being elected. Around the same time, India was angered by derogatory comments from three Maldivian officials about Modi. But analysts say the countrys ailing economy has made its leadership mend its ties with India. The Maldives is staring at a debt default as its foreign exchange reserves have dropped to 440m (334m), just enough for one-and-a-half months of imports. On Monday, Muizzu said he held extensive discussions with Modi to chart a path for the future collaboration between our two countries. He thanked India and said the budgetary support would be instrumental in addressing foreign exchange issues. The two countries have also agreed on a deal to start talks on a free trade agreement. Ahead of his meeting with Modi, Muizzu had told the BBC that he expected India to help the country as it has done in the past. India is fully cognisant of our fiscal situation, and as one of our biggest development partners, will always be ready to ease our burden, find better alternatives and solutions to the challenges we face, he said. Without referring to his anti-India campaign, he said: We are confident that any differences can be addressed through open dialogue and mutual understanding. This was in contrast to his previous decisions, some of which were seen as a way to reduce Delhis influence and forge closer ties with Indias rival China. In February, his administration allowed a Chinese research ship to dock in the Maldives, much to Delhis displeasure. Some saw it as a mission to collect data which could be used by the Chinese military for submarine operations. Muizzu has however rejected the pro-China tag, calling his policies as Maldives First. But the country also continues to depend on China, which has so far extended 1.37bn in loans. Source: BBC --Agencies",

The previous administrations approval of electricity prices for Adani Green Energy Ltd.s projects was a problem, Foreign Minister Vijitha Herath told reporters after a meeting of the Cabinet ministers on Tuesday. The new government would give the deal a fresh look after parliamentary elections are held Nov. 14, he said. The move to reassess the Adani Green deal follows through on a campaign pledge by newly elected president Anura Kumara Dissanayake, who was swept into office last month after a closely contested three-way race. Dissanayake had called the project a threat to Sri Lankas energy sovereignty and vowed to cancel it. Herath on Tuesday said no policy decisions on major projects would be taken before the parliamentary poll. Despite Dissanayakes victory, his bloc only had three seats in Sri Lankas 225-seat legislature. Any challenge to the deal would be a blow to Gautam Adanis ambitions, as the group led by Asias second-richest person looks to develop multiple infrastructure projects in the island nation. Projects in the works include expansion of the Colombo container-ship port backed by the US Development Finance Corp. Indias Ministry of External Affairs didnt respond to an email seeking comment. An Adani Group representative didnt immediately respond to requests for comment. Adani has proposed two wind projects in Sri Lanka  one in Mannar and a second in Pooneryn, both located in the countrys northeast. The Mannar project is separately facing court challenges from environmental groups over threat to wildlife, and complaints about alleged lack of transparency in the award of the project.

        "date": "October 8, 2024 07:21 pm",
        "content": "Hezbollah left the door open to a negotiated ceasefire on Tuesday after Israeli forces made new incursions in Lebanon, and Israels defence minister said another senior official from the Iran-backed group appeared to have been killed. In what could be the latest in a series of major blows to Hezbollah, Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said it appeared the replacement for slain Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah had been eliminated. Hashem Safieddine, a top Hezbollah official, was widely expected to succeed Nasrallah. Safieddine has not been heard from publicly since an Israeli airstrike late last week. Hezbollah is an organization without a head. Nasrallah was eliminated, his replacement was probably also eliminated, Gallant told officers at the Israeli militarys northern command centre, in a brief video segment distributed by the military. Theres no one to make decisions, no one to act, he said, without providing further details. In a televised speech, Hezbollah deputy leader Naim Qassem, said he supported attempts to secure a truce, and for the first time did not mention the end of war in Gaza as a pre-condition to halting combat on the Lebanon-Israel border. Qassem said Hezbollah supported attempts by Speaker of Parliament Nabih Berri, a Hezbollah ally, to secure a halt to fighting, which has escalated in recent weeks with the Israeli ground incursions and the killing of top Hezbollah leaders. We support the political activity being led by Berri under the title of a ceasefire, Qassem said in his 30-minute televised address. It was not clear whether this signalled any change in stance, after a year in which the group has said it is fighting in support of the Palestinians during the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza, and would not stop without a ceasefire there. Speaking in front of curtains from an undisclosed location, Qassem said the conflict with Israel was a war about who cries first, and Hezbollah would not cry first. The groups capabilities were intact despite painful blows from Israel. We are striking them. We are hurting them and we will prolong the time. Dozens of cities are within range of the resistances missiles. We assure you that our capabilities are fine, said Qassem. His televised address comes 11 days after the killing of Nasrallah, the most devastating setback Israel has dealt its foe in decades. Qassem said the group would elect a new secretary general and announce it once it has been done. Israel kept up the pressure on Hezbollah on Tuesday by killing another one of its senior figures and launching new operations in southern Lebanon. Qassem said Israel had yet to advance after ground clashes that broke out in south Lebanon a week ago. In any case, after the issue of a ceasefire takes shape, and once diplomacy can achieve it, all of the other details can be discussed and decisions can be taken, Qassem said. If the enemy (Israel) continues its war, then the battlefield will decide. The regional tensions triggered a year ago by Palestinian armed group Hamas attack on southern Israel have spiralled in recent weeks into a series of Israeli operations by land and air against Lebanon. On Oct. 1, Iran, sponsor of both Hezbollah and Hamas, fired missiles at Israel. WARNING FROM IRAN Iran warned Israel on Tuesday against any retliatory attacks. Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi said any attack on Irans infrastructure will be met with retaliation. Araqchi will visit Saudi Arabia and other countries in the Middle East starting on Tuesday. In a video on state media he said the aim of his trip was discuss ways to prevent the shameless crimes of the Zionist regime in Lebanon in continuation of the crimes in Gaza. Sources have told Reuters that Gulf Arab states have sought to reassure Tehran of their neutrality in the conflict. On the ground, the area of Israeli operations in Lebanon has been expanding. The Israeli military said it was conducting limited, localised, targeted operations in Lebanons southwest, having previously announced such operations in the southeast. A World Food Programme official voiced concern about Lebanons food supply, saying thousands of hectares of farmland across the countrys south has burned or been abandoned. Agriculture-wise, food production-wise, (there is) extraordinary concern for Lebanons ability to continue to feed itself, Matthew Hollingworth, WFP country director in Lebanon, told a Geneva press briefing, adding that harvests will not occur and produce is rotting in fields. World Health Organization official Ian Clarke in Beirut told the same briefing that there was a much higher risk of disease outbreaks among Lebanons displaced population. Israels military struck Beiruts southern suburbs overnight again and said it had killed a figure responsible for Hezbollahs budgeting and logistics, Suhail Hussein Husseini, in what would be the latest in a string of Israeli assassinations of leaders and commanders of Hezbollah and Hamas. Many Israelis have regained confidence in their long-vaunted military and intelligence after deadly blows in recent weeks to the command structure of Hezbollah. The situation in Lebanon is getting worse by the day, the European Unions foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, told the European Parliament, calling for a ceasefire. Some 20 of the Lebanese population had been forced to move, he said. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "title": "Jaishankars visit was crucial in ending debt restructuring  Minister",
        "date": "October 9, 2024 08:51 am",
        "content": "Sri Lanka on Tuesday said the recent visit by Indian External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar was important in ending its debt restructuring with international sovereign bond holders. Jaishankar, who made a day-long trip to Sri Lanka on October 4, became the first foreign dignitary to visit the island nation after Anura Kumara Dissanayake assumed office as the new president on September 23. Cabinet spokesman and foreign affairs minister Vijitha Herath told reporters here that Indias signing up for the agreement as a bilateral creditor endorsing that the agreement was compatible with the comparative treatment principle in debt restructuring. Ahead of the presidential polls last month, cash-strapped Sri Lanka had on September 19 announced that it had reached an in principle agreement with the external commercial creditors for the restructuring of approximately USD 17.5 billion of external commercial debts. Sri Lanka declared its first-ever sovereign default in mid-April 2022, having run out of its foreign exchange reserves, the first since gaining independence from Britain in 1948. The halt to the debt services meant that the multilateral creditor nations and commercial lenders could not extend fresh financing to the country. In July this year, the Sri Lankan government reached a debt restructuring deal with international sovereign bondholders after protracted negotiations with countries such as China, India, France and Japan. Sri Lanka is currently in negotiations with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for the next tranche of the USD 2.9 billion bailout package for which the IMF has made external debt restructuring conditional. The third tranche of the bailout package was released in mid-June as the Washington-headquartered global lender said on August 2 that Sri Lankas economic reform programme has yielded good results. Herath said the bond holders had asked for agreement from bilateral creditors on the aspect of comparative treatment of debt. Meanwhile, asked if Indian projects in Sri Lanka, including the Adani investment projects, had been discussed with Jaishankar, Herath said since the current government is a transitional government the next parliamentary election is due in November such matters were not discussed. The ruling National Peoples Power (NPP), in the run up to the September 21 election, had said they would annul the Adani wind power project in the southeastern region. Herath said the government needs to weigh the pros and cons of the Adani wind project. The dispute was about the high cost per unit of power and the issue was raised in court. We shall review all matters connected after the next government is formed, Herath said. Source: PTI --Agencies",

        "title": "Israel says it has killed slain Hezbollah leaders successors",
        "date": "October 9, 2024 08:58 am",
        "content": "(Reuters) - Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Tuesday Israeli airstrikes had killed two successors to Hezbollahs slain leader, as Israel expanded its ground offensive against the Iran-backed group with a fourth army division deployed into south Lebanon. Netanyahu spoke in a video released by his office hours after the deputy leader of Hezbollah, which is reeling after a spate of killings of senior commanders in Israeli airstrikes, left the door open to a negotiated ceasefire. Weve degraded Hezbollahs capabilities. We took out thousands of terrorists, including (Hassan) Nasrallah himself and Nasrallahs replacement, and the replacement of the replacement, Netanyahu said, without naming the latter two. Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said Hashem Safieddine, the man expected to succeed Nasrallah, had probably been eliminated. It was not immediately clear whom Netanyahu meant by the replacement of the replacement. Later, Israeli military spokesman Daniel Hagari said Israel knew Safieddine was in Hezbollahs intelligence headquarters when fighter jets bombed it last week and Safieddines status was being checked and when we know, we will inform the public. Safieddine has not been heard from publicly since that airstrike, part of an escalating Israeli offensive after a year of border clashes with Hezbollah. The group is the most formidably armed of Irans proxy forces across the Middle East and has been acting in support of Palestinian militants fighting Israel in Gaza. Today, Hezbollah is weaker than it has been for many, many years, Netanyahu said. Israels military said on Tuesday that heavy air strikes against underground Hezbollah installations in southern Lebanon over the prior 24 hours killed at least 50 fighters including six sector commanders and regional officials. The heightened regional tensions kindled a year ago by Palestinian armed group Hamas attack from Gaza on southern Israel have escalated in recent weeks to engulf Lebanon. On Oct. 1, Iran, sponsor of both Hezbollah and Hamas, fired missiles at Israel. On Tuesday, Iran warned Israel not to follow through on threats of retaliation. Its foreign minister said any attack on Irans infrastructure would be avenged while a senior Iranian official told Gulf states it would be unacceptable and would draw a response if they allowed their airspace to be used against Iran. Western powers are seeking a diplomatic solution, fearing the conflict could roil the wider, oil-producing Middle East. The Pentagon on Tuesday announced that Gallant will not go ahead with a visit to Washington and a meeting with his U.S. counterpart, Lloyd Austin, planned for Wednesday. In a televised speech from an undisclosed location, Hezbollahs deputy leader Naim Qassem said he backed attempts to secure a truce. For the first time, the end of war in Gaza was not mentioned as a pre-condition to halting the combat in Lebanon. Qassem said Hezbollah backed moves by Speaker of Parliament Nabih Berri, a Hezbollah ally, to secure a halt to the fighting. Netanyahus office declined to comment on Qassems remarks. U.S. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller told a briefing in Washington that Hezbollah had changed their tune and want a ceasefire because the group is on the back foot and is getting battered on the battlefield. Qassem said Hezbollahs capabilities were intact despite painful blows from Israel. Dozens of cities are within range of the resistances missiles. We assure you that our capabilities are fine. FOURTH ISRAELI ARMY DIVISION IN LEBANON The Israeli military said it had sent the 146th Division into south Lebanon, the first reserve division to have been deployed over the border, and was extending ground operations against Hezbollah from southeast Lebanon into its southwest. A military spokesperson declined to say how many troops were in Lebanon at one time. But the military had previously announced that three other army divisions were operating there, meaning that thousands of soldiers were likely on Lebanese soil. The Israeli military announced on Oct. 1 that ground forces had entered Lebanon, initially with commando units that were then followed by regular armoured units and infantry units. Overnight, Israel again bombed Beiruts southern suburbs where Hezbollah is headquartered and said it had killed a figure responsible for budgeting and logistics, Suhail Hussein Husseini - the latest in a string of assassinations of some of Hezbollahs top officials. The Israeli military on Tuesday issued a new evacuation warning for residents, especially in specific buildings in Beiruts southern suburbs, where Hezbollah has its headquarters. In northern Israel not far from the Lebanon border, warning sirens sounded regularly throughout Tuesday as authorities said Hezbollah fired almost 200 rockets into Israel. An Israeli military spokesperson said over 3,000 rockets had been fired into Israel from Lebanon so far in October, but interceptions by air defences had prevented many casualties and significant damage. Targets on Tuesday again included Haifa, the northern port city where there were multiple reports of damage to buildings from missile debris. Israels military said it had struck the launchers that fired the missiles at Haifa. The mushrooming Israeli-Hezbollah conflict has killed well over 1,000 people in Lebanon in the past two weeks and prompted the mass flight of more than a million. Israels stated objective is to make its northern areas safe from Hezbollah rocket fire and allow thousands of displaced residents to return. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

The price of an egg was seen reduced to Rs. 30 in local markets recently, however, it was reported that an egg is being sold at prices of over Rs. 40 this week. Chairman of Sri Lanka Livestock Producers Association Ajith Gunasekara stated that several factors have impacted the relevant price hike. A large number of wholesalers have sold the eggs at lower price. It brought great relief to the customers. By now, the surplus products have left the market. Only the daily eggs that are currently produced come to the market. But there has been a huge price fluctuation. We have a question whether it happens artificially.",

        "date": "October 9, 2024 10:37 am",
        "content": "Sri Lanka Computer Emergency Response Team (SL CERT) has reported a significant rise in complaints related to online financial fraud in 2024. According to SL CERTs Senior Information Engineer Charuka Damunupola, over 340 complaints involving financial scams have been received so far this year. Up to September, weve received 7,210 complaints regarding online scams, with the majority of these linked to social media platforms. When we focus specifically on online-based fraud, around 20 of the complaints involve financial scams. This highlights a growing trend of internet fraud targeting online banking users, Damunupola stated. He further explained that many victims fall prey to scams due to a lack of attention to security measures, particularly with One-Time Passwords (OTPs). Many users do not take proper care in safeguarding their OTPs or fail to recognize fraudulent websites. This often results in them being caught in these online banking scams, Damunupola added. He further emphasized the need for increased vigilance as more users turn to online banking, noting that the rise in online financial fraud highlights the importance of educating the public about cybersecurity practices.",

        "content": "The story of a Sri Lankan worker, who migrated to Australia less than a decade ago and has become a millionaire now, has taken the internet by storm. At the age of 25, Vinul Karunaratne has made enough money to quit and shift full-time to doing gig jobs. Karunaratne moved to Australia in 2015 and started working at 7-Eleven stores. But in 2019, he started taking on end-of-lease cleaning jobs on Airtasker. Its a Sydney-based online marketplace that enables people to outsource everyday tasks - such as cleaning, assembling furniture, or yard work - for others to complete in exchange for cash. Karunaratne told local news channel 7News that he didnt have much resources and equipment when he started. When I started, I didnt even have much equipment. I had a vacuum, mop, bucket, and some rags, he said, adding, That was the stuff I had at home. His hard work eventually paid off and he was soon able to ditch his job at 7-Eleven to shift full-time to Airtasker. According to the platform, Karunaratne is one of the top 10 earners on Airtasker. He manages to pocket an impressive 1,000 to 1,400 everyday. Dailymail reported that Karunaratne mainly performs bond cleans but also steams carpets and cleans offices. Tim Fung, Airtasker founder and CEO said, referring to Karunaratnes success on the platform that anyone can earn extra cash by working hard. Fung also termed Karunaratnes story as inspirational. Fung hoped that more work will be available on his platform in the coming days. Karunaratne also shared his experience of working with the platform, saying it enabled him to be his own boss. Its physical work, but its good money. I enjoy the flexibility and working on my own terms. Im my own boss, he was quoted as saying by the Australian media outlet. --With agencies inputs",

        "date": "October 9, 2024 11:37 am",
        "content": "The US Department of Justice has arrested a man who allegedly planned an attack on Election Day in the name of the Islamic State group. The suspect, Nasir Ahmad Tawhedi, 27, is a citizen of Afghanistan residing in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, according to prosecutors. This defendant, motivated by ISIS, allegedly conspired to commit a violent attack, on Election Day, here on our homeland, said FBI Director Christopher Wray in a statement on Tuesday. The FBI said he was attempting stockpile firearms, and had taken steps to liquidate his familys assets and relocate members overseas. Mr Tawhedi is charged with providing, attempting to provide, and conspiracy to provide support or resources to a foreign terrorist organization; and with trying to procure firearms and ammunition to use to commit a felony or act of terrorism. The FBI said Mr Tawhedi worked with an unnamed co-conspirator, who is a juvenile relative and also a citizen of Afghanistan. It accuses him of consuming Islamic State propaganda via the internet, based on Google records obtained by law enforcement, and donating to a charity used as a front for IS. We will continue to combat the ongoing threat that ISIS and its supporters pose to Americas national security, and we will identify, investigate, and prosecute the individuals who seek to terrorize the American people, said Attorney General Merrick Garland. According to the BBC news partner CBS, federal investigators affidavit alleges that Mr Tawhedi searched for surveillance cameras in Washington, and webcams showing the White House and Washington Monument. It also alleges that he researched states with more lax gun laws. Mr Tawhedi sought AK-47 assault rifles to use in the attack, authorities claim. On 7 October, he and the co-conspirator met with individuals who actually worked undercover for the FBI to purchase the weapons and ammunition. After the purchase, Mr Tawhedi and his co-conspirator were arrested. In an interview conducted after his arrest on Monday, the FBI said Mr Tawhedi allegedly confirmed he planned an Election Day attack that would target large gatherings of people and that he planned to die carrying it out. Mr Tawhedi arrived in the US in September 2021 on a special immigrant visa with his wife and young child. He lived in Oklahoma City at the time of his arrest. It is not immediately clear if he has legal representation. Source: BBC --Agencies",
