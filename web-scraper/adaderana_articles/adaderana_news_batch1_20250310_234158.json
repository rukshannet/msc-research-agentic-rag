        "title": "Schaffters death caused by ingestion of cyanide, and not strangulation, court told",
        "date": "February 8, 2023 08:54 pm",
        "content": "It has been revealed that the death of prominent businessman Dinesh Schaffter, the director of Jana Shakti PLC, was caused by ingestion of cyanide, when the case was taken up before the Aluthkade Magistrates Court today (Feb. 08). Further, the post-mortem examination report has also concluded that the injuries which have been caused by strangulation were not fatal. The Homicide and Organized Crime Investigation Division of the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) presented the facts regarding the death of Dinesh Schaffter today, before Additional Magistrate Mrs. Rajindra Jayasuriya. In the meantime, the investigation officers pointed out before the court that many important facts were uncovered after analyzing the data of Shafters iPhone mobile phone and iPad. Thus, the officers also mentioned that several documents prepared by Schaffter for his wife and his wifes parents were found saved in the mobile phone and the iPad. Furthermore, it was revealed in the court that Dinesh Schaffters iPad contained a document called List among the data which had been saved within Apple Note and that the document contained a word KCM and ZIP TIE and also a list of several other items. The investigation officers stated before the court that KCM is a shortened name referring to Cyanide and ZIP TIE is a plastic item used for tying-up something or someone. In addition, another name list called THE LIST has been found in his iPad, in which the names of five people namely, Mrs. Muthukumarana, Jagath Seneviratne, Jayaratne, Anton Hemantha and Elian Gunawardena were mentioned, the investigation officers said. The officers stated that there were also telephone numbers and addresses of those individuals. It was also mentioned before the court that the last four of the five names in question contained a sentence containing an intention to destroy. Furthermore, a PDF file containing photos of Brian Thomas has also been found on the iPad. The investigation officers mentioned before the court that Josephine Thomas and Christian Thomas were also named in it. There was also a sentence that MOST IMPORTANT WHO IS BEHIND B.T. GET MY MONEY BACK. Accordingly, the investigation officers submitted the WhatsApp messages to the court, which were transmitted between Dinesh Schaffter and Brian Thomas from December 25, 2019, to December 15, 2022, the date on which he had died. In addition, at 2:48:50 p.m. on the day of Schaffters death, Brian Thomas had sent a WhatsApp message to Schaffter stating that he had no need to meet him, and it also mentioned an attack he had made during a previous meeting, the officers said. Schaffter had tried to call Brian Thomas to the Borella cemetery, but his attempt was not successful, the investigating officers emphasized. It has further been revealed before the court that certain messages sent by Mr. Schaffter to Brian Thomas had been deleted. Later, the postmortem examination report of Dinesh Schaffter was read in front of the Colombo Additional Magistrate Mrs. Rajindra Jayasuriya, whereas the Additional Magistrate declared that it stated the injuries caused by Schaffters strangulation were not fatal and that his death was due to ingestion of Cyanide. The 52-year-old Janashakthi PLC Director was found tied up in the driving seat of his car at the Borella cemetery on December 15, 2022, and was rushed to the ICU of the National Hospital in Colombo. He passed away while undergoing treatment. Investigations had revealed that Schaffter had left home at Flower Road in Cinnamon Garden at around 2.00 p.m. on December 15, informing his wife and the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of one of his companies that he was going to meet an individual who owes him a large sum of money. At around 2.48 p.m. on the same day, Schaffter had shared his live location with his wife and the CEO. The live location ended from the General Cemetery in Borella and the calls made by his wife had gone unanswered. Due to growing suspicions, Schaffters wife had asked the relevant CEO to check on Schaffter. Subsequently, the CEO had driven to the cemetery in search of Schaffter. At around 3.00 p.m., the CEO found Schaffters car parked inside the cemetery. Schaffter had been bound with zip ties and a wire around his neck at the time he was found by the CEO, who later freed Schaffter with the assistance of a cemetery labourer and admitted him to the National Hospital in Colombo at around 3.15 p.m. Schaffter, who was in critical condition, died at around 10.30 p.m., while receiving treatment at the ICU of the hospital. The police have also found an electrical code inside Schaffters car. Following the murder, the Homicide and Organised Crimes Division of the Criminal Investigations Department (CID) had launched an investigation in collaboration with the Borella police. The CID investigations had also revealed that the cemetery labourer had witnessed an unknown individual walking away from Schaffters car. Meanwhile, the remains of the deceased were produced before the chief medical officer at the Institute of Forensic Medicine and Toxicology. The post-mortem had revealed that the death had occurred due to strangulation. Moreover, statements had been recorded from a total of 23 people with regard to the murder of Director of Janashakthi Group Business Dinesh Schaffter, according to Police Spokesman SSP Nihal Thalduwa. Schaffters wife, family members and former English cricket commentator Brian Thomas are also among those who gave statements to the investigators. In addition, the foreign travels of Brian Thomas were barred on December 16, pursuant to an order given by Colombo Additional Magistrate Harshana Kekunawala. At the same time, Thomas mobile phone was taken into the custody of the CID. Later, the Colombo Additional Magistrate had allowed the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) to obtain DNA testing through the Government Analyst on the late Dinesh Schaffters blood samples, nails, body parts and some spot evidence, in accordance with a request made by the CID. The Magisterial inquiry into the murder was conducted on January 10, after it was adjourned on 04 January. Accordingly, the inquest was, once again, held in the chambers of Colombo Additional Magistrate Rajindra Jayasuriya, as per a request made by the relatives of the deceased. Evidence was also recorded from Schaffters brother, who had identified the body, under the direction of officials from the Criminal Investigation Department (CID). In 2019, Schaffter had also filed a complaint with the CID regarding financial fraud amounting to over Rs. 140 million. Thomas was arrested in 2021 over the incident and was released on bail. It is reported that Thomas had borrowed the amount from Schaffter claiming that it would be invested in a lending company in the country.",

        "date": "February 8, 2023 09:36 pm",
        "content": "Sri Lankan high commissioner Milinda Moragoda met Union health minister Mansukh Mandaviya on Wednesday to discuss ways to deepen health cooperation, including help in expediting the process for Sri Lankan importers to procure medicines from India. Mandaviya and Moragoda focused on a range of issues during their meeting, including ways through which existing bilateral cooperation in the health sector could be broadened and deepened. Moragoda specifically raised issues such as assistance in expediting the process for Sri Lankan importers to procure medicines from India, effective and efficient use of an existing Indian line of credit to purchase essential medicines, and a possible government-to-government mechanism to procure Indian medicines, according to a statement from the Sri Lankan mission. He also requested Mandaviya to explore the possibility of providing post-doctoral training opportunities for Sri Lankan medical professionals in Indian institutions. Potential opportunities for Indian companies to establish joint ventures and make investments for establishing pharmaceutical manufacturing facilities in designated zones in Sri Lanka were also discussed, the statement said. Moragoda thanked Mandaviya for the assistance extended by the ministry of chemicals and fertilizers to materialize a line of credit of 55 million in 2022 to meet Sri Lankas needs of urea for the Yala paddy cultivation season. Moragoda also met minister of state for external affairs Meenakshi Lekhi on Tuesday to discuss an exhibition on late Geoffrey Bawa, Sri Lankas premier architect, to be held in New Delhi next month. He briefed her on activities lined up to celebrate the 75th anniversary of diplomatic relations between the two sides. The exhibition with the theme It is essential to be there, will feature the work of Bawa and will be held at the National Gallery of Modern Art (NGMA). Lekhi pledged support to make the exhibition a success. The Sri Lanakan high commission has planned a series of activities to celebrate the 75th anniversary of diplomatic ties. It has released the Sinhala translation of Indian author Jairam Rameshs book The Light of Asia: The poem that defined the Buddha at the Independence Day flag hoisting ceremony held at the mission in New Delhi on February 4.

        "title": "Asia set to use half of worlds electricity by 2025",
        "date": "February 8, 2023 10:04 pm",
        "content": "Asia will for the first time use half of the worlds electricity by 2025, even as Africa continues to consume far less than its share of the global population, according to a new forecast released Wednesday by the International Energy Agency. Much of Asias electricity use will be in China, a nation of 1.4 billion people whose share of global consumption will rise from a quarter in 2015 to a third by the middle of this decade, the Paris-based body said. China will be consuming more electricity than the European Union, United States and India combined, said Keisuke Sadamori, the IEAs director of energy markets and security. By contrast, Africa  home to almost a fifth of worlds nearly 8 billion inhabitants  will account for just 3 of global electricity consumption in 2025. This and the rapidly growing population mean there is still a massive need for increased electrification in Africa, said Sadamori. The IEAs annual report predicts that nuclear power and renewables such as wind and solar will account for much of the growth in global electricity supply over the coming three years. This will prevent a significant rise in greenhouse gas emissions from the power sector, it said. Scientists say sharp cuts in all sources of emissions are needed as soon as possible to keep average global temperatures from rising 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels. That target, laid down in the 2015 Paris climate accord, appears increasingly doubtful as temperatures have already increased by more than 1.1 C since the reference period. One hope for meeting the goal is a wholesale shift away from fossil fuels such as coal, gas and oil toward low-carbon sources of energy. But while some regions are reducing their use of coal and gas for electricity production, in others consumption is increasing, the IEA said. The 134-page also report warned that electricity demand and supply are becoming increasingly weather dependent, a problem it urged policymakers to address. In addition to drought in Europe, there were heat waves in India (last year), said Sadamori. Similarly, central and eastern China were hit by heat waves and drought. The United States also saw severe winter storms in December, and all those events put massive strain on the power systems of these regions. As the clean energy transition gathers pace, the impact of weather events on electricity demand will intensify due to the increased electrification of heating, while the share of weather-dependent renewables will continue to grow in the generation mix, the IEA said. In such a world, increasing the flexibility of power systems while ensuring security of supply and resilience of networks will be crucial. Source - The Associated Press -Agencies",

        "date": "February 8, 2023 10:34 pm",
        "content": "The United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) in Sri Lanka today acknowledged a recent contribution of CHF 800,000 (approximately US802,000) from the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC) at a special event held at the Embassy of Switzerland to Sri Lanka and the Maldives. The funding is being used to provide much-needed cash and other assistance to improve food security among rural farming communities affected by the countrys economic crisis. Through this funding, over 1,000 smallholder farmers across five drought-prone districts are being provided with LKR 50,000 each (approximately US140) to access essential items, including food. The funding will also support recovery among communities grappling with the twin challenges of the economic and climate crises. Through a suite of assistance, which includes diversified sources of income and enhanced access to markets, WFP aims to improve the livelihoods of those most vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change. Switzerland is supporting Sri Lanka in many ways during this difficult time. Farmers, their families and many people associated with the agricultural sector are currently facing enormous difficulties. I am grateful that we have developed a partnership with WFP to strengthen the resilience of Sri Lankan farmers. This will ultimately benefit the entire population, said Ambassador of Switzerland to Sri Lanka and the Maldives Dr. Dominik Furgler. Smallholder farmers form the backbone of our food systems but are among those hardest-hit by the economic crisis, said Abdur Rahim Siddiqui, Representative and Country Director of WFP Sri Lanka. Their capacity to cope has been stretched to the limit, severely undermining their ability to withstand any future disasters such as floods and drought. This funding from Switzerland is timely and critical to assist these communities in meeting their immediate food needs, while helping to restore food security in the long term. Sri Lanka was ranked second among countries most affected by extreme weather events in the last 20 years, as per the Global Climate Risk Index 2019. As part of its efforts to strengthen food security, WFP works towards making food systems more robust and resilient to the effects of the climate crisis. The generous contribution from the Swiss Government enables WFP to sustain the positive outcomes of prior projects which strengthened resilience of climate-vulnerable communities and promotes self-reliance among smallholders even in times of crises. The United Nations World Food Programme is the worlds largest humanitarian organization, saving lives in emergencies and using food assistance to build a pathway to peace, stability and prosperity for people recovering from conflict, disasters and the impact of climate change.

        "title": "Turkish leader admits shortcomings as quake toll tops 15,000",
        "date": "February 9, 2023 07:28 am",
        "content": "Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Wednesday conceded shortcomings after criticism of his governments response to the massive earthquake that has killed over 15,000 people in Turkey and Syria. The sprawling scale of the disaster that flattened thousands of buildings, trapping an unknown number of people, has swamped relief operations already hampered by freezing weather. Survivors have been left to scramble for food and shelter  and in some cases watch helplessly as their relatives called for rescue, and eventually went silent under the debris. My nephew, my sister-in-law and my sister-in-laws sister are in the ruins. They are trapped under the ruins and there is no sign of life, said Semire Coban, a kindergarten teacher, in Turkeys Hatay. We cant reach them. We are trying to talk to them, but they are not responding We are waiting for help. It has been 48 hours now, she said. Still, searchers kept pulling survivors from the debris three days after the 7.8 magnitude quake that is already one of the deadliest this century, even as the death toll continues to rise. As criticism mounted online, Erdogan visited one of the hardest-hit spots, quake epicentre Kahramanmaras, and acknowledged problems in the response. Of course, there are shortcomings. The conditions are clear to see. Its not possible to be ready for a disaster like this, he said. Twitter was also not working on Turkish mobile networks, according to AFP journalists and NetBlocks web monitoring group. Children saved The window for rescuers to find survivors is narrowing as the effort nears the 72-hour mark that disaster experts consider the most likely period to save lives. Yet on Wednesday, rescuers pulled children from under a collapsed building in the hard-hit Turkish province of Hatay, where whole stretches of towns have been levelled. All of a sudden we heard voices and thanks to the excavator immediately we heard the voices of three people at the same time, said rescuer Alperen Cetinkaya. We are expecting more of them the chances of getting people out of here alive are very high, he added. Officials and medics said 12,391 people had died in Turkey and at least 2,992 in Syria from Mondays 7.8-magnitude tremor, bringing the total to 15,383  and experts fear the number will continue to rise sharply. In Brussels, the EU is planning a donors conference in March to mobilise international aid for Syria and Turkey. We are now racing against the clock to save lives together, said EU chief Ursula von der Leyen on Twitter. No one should be left alone when a tragedy like this hits a people, von der Leyen said People dying every second Due to the scale of the damage and the lack of help coming to certain areas, survivors said they felt alone in responding to the disaster. Even the buildings that havent collapsed were severely damaged. There are now more people under the rubble than those above it, a resident named Hassan, who did not provide his full name, said in the rebel-held Syrian town of Jindayris. There are around 400-500 people trapped under each collapsed building, with only 10 people trying to pull them out. And there is no machinery, he added. The White Helmets, leading efforts to rescue people buried under rubble in rebel-held areas of Syria, have appealed for international help in their race against time. They have been toiling since the quake to pull survivors out from under the debris of dozens of flattened buildings in northwestern areas of war-torn Syria that remain outside the governments control. A leading UN official called for the facilitation of aid access to rebel-held areas in the northwest, warning relief stocks will soon be depleted. Put politics aside and let us do our humanitarian work, the UNs resident Syria coordinator El-Mostafa Benlamlih told AFP in an interview. Syria appeals for EU help The issue of aid to Syria is a delicate one, and the sanctioned government in Damascus made an official plea to the EU for help, the blocs commissioner for crisis management Janez Lenarcic said. A decade of civil war and Syrian-Russian aerial bombardment had already destroyed hospitals, collapsed the economy and prompted electricity, fuel and water shortages. The European Commission is encouraging EU member countries to respond to Syrias request for medical supplies and food, while monitoring to ensure that any aid is not diverted by President Bashar al-Assads government, Lenarcic noted. Dozens of nations, including the United States, China and the Gulf States have pledged to help, and search teams as well as relief supplies have already arrived. The European Union was swift to dispatch rescue teams to Turkey after the massive earthquake struck the country on Monday close to the border with Syria. But it initially offered only minimal assistance to Syria because of EU sanctions imposed since 2011 on Assads government over its brutal crackdown on protesters that spiralled into a civil war. The Turkey-Syria border is one of the worlds most active earthquake zones. Mondays quake was the largest Turkey has seen since 1939, when 33,000 people died in eastern Erzincan province. In 1999, a 7.4 magnitude earthquake killed more than 17,000. AFP Source: AFP --Agencies",

        "content": "Former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa has revealed that the money found at the Presidents House in Colombo by protesters on 09 July 2022 were from his personal funds, and was due to be distributed amongst the public. This was disclosed by the Criminal Investigations Department (CID) to Colombo Fort Magistrate Thilina Gamage yesterday (08 Feb.). Accordingly, appearing on behalf of the former President, Presidents Counsel (PC) Harigupta Senadeera requested that the funds, amounting to nearly Rs. 17.5 million, which is currently in the custody of the court, be handed over back to Rajapaksa. However, the opposing counsel, including Presidents Counsel Rienzie Arsekularatne, vehemently objected to the funds being released back to Rajapaksa in the absence of a formal investigation under the Prevention of Money Laundering and Bribery Acts, adding that the manner in which the funds were obtained were not revealed in Rajapaksas statement. Thus, they requested that the court refrain from handing over the money on the grounds that the former President was not present in court, and that the manner in which he obtained these funds are yet to be disclosed. Appearing on behalf of the Inspector General of Police (IGP), Attorney-at-Law DIG Ruwan Gunasekara stated that the IGP had ordered that the relevant investigations be handed over to the CID from the Special Crimes Unit on the instructions of Minister of Public Security Tiran Alles, as they had delayed investigations. The opposing counsel argued, however, accusing Alles of being the very reason as to why these investigations were delayed, by interfering unnecessarily. Accordingly, Colombo Fort Magistrate Thilina Gamage stated in open court that an inquiry into the matter is required if the former Head of State fails to disclose how the money was obtained. Meanwhile, in relation to the incident where the Officer in Charge (OIC) of Fort Police had received a call ordering him to hand over the funds to Minister Tiran Alles, the phone records presented to the court yesterday revealed that Senior Deputy Inspector General (SDIG) in charge of the Western Province, Deshabandu Tennakoon, had in fact made a phone call to the Fort OIC on the day in question. The money was found by protesters on 09 July 2022, when they stormed the presidential residence during mass anti-government protests. At least Rs. 17.5 million in cash was handed over to the Fort Police by the protesters who were at the presidential residence on that day, which was subsequently handed over to the Fort Magistrates Court three weeks later.",

        "date": "February 9, 2023 11:47 am",
        "content": "The Colombo Chief Magistrate has pointed out to the Criminal Investigation Division (CID) that a warrant will not be required for the arrest of State Minister Diana Gamage, if she has violated the Immigration and Emigration Act. Last month, the CID was ordered to obtain a report from the British High Commission in Colombo on Gamages citizenship, and to conduct further investigations in this regard. The relevant report was presented in court today (09 Feb.). Appearing on behalf of the petitioner, Presidents Counsel Rienzie Arsekularatne emphasised that in the event an average person of a non-political background committed such an offence, prompt legal action would have been taken against the said individual, however, no such emergence is being seen in this case owing to the fact that it concerns a State Minister. Accordingly, the next hearing of the case was fixed for 02 March 2023 on the orders of Colombo Chief Magistrate Prasanna Alwis. The State Minister currently is at the risk of losing her Parliamentary seat on account of allegations over her citizenship, after social activist Oshala Herath filed a complaint at the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption (CIABOC) seeking an investigation into the issuance of a diplomatic passport to the State Minister by the Department of Immigration and Emigration. Herath alleged that issuing a diplomatic passport to the State Minister is against the Immigration and Emigration Act since she also has British citizenship.",

        "date": "February 9, 2023 12:17 pm",
        "content": "Germanys former chancellor Angela Merkel on Wednesday received a prestigious UN award for opening her country to refugees during her time in office. Merkel was hailed for welcoming more than 1.2 million refugees and asylum seekers to Germany in 2015 and 2016 as she was awarded the Felix Houphouet-Boigny UNESCO Peace Prize in Ivory Coasts capital Yamoussoukro. The jury wanted to honour the courageous decision taken in 2015 to welcome more than a million refugees... when at the same time so many voices were calling for the closure of Europe, said Audrey Azoulay, director general of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization. You were, at that time, the vision of courage in politics. Merkels decision came at the peak of a crisis fuelled by the war in Syria. Respecting, preserving and sharing human rights is the mission of each of us. We decided that it was necessary to respect these principles in our migration policy, said the veteran former leader, who spent 16 years at the helm and stepped down in 2021. This was only possible because many people rolled up their sleeves on the ground, she said at the Felix Houphouet-Boigny Foundation, named after Ivory Coasts first president. Despite the hostility of public opinion, you took the decision to open Germanys borders to refugees fleeing conflict zones, said Ivorian President Alassane Ouattara. You have reminded all world leaders of their duty of solidarity towards all humans, he added. Around 2,000 people were invited to the ceremony, which was set up in 1989 and has previously handed awards to Nelson Mandela, Yasser Arafat, Yitzhak Rabin and Francois Hollande.

China was a leading source market for inbound tourism to Sri Lanka and one of SriLankans premier leisure traveller segments before the pandemic. SriLankan Airlines is positioning for a strong comeback in China upon its return, it said. SriLankan will launch passenger flights to Shanghai on April 03, 2023. Accordingly, flights will depart from Colombo to Shanghai every Monday, Thursday and Friday, and return from Shanghai to Colombo every Tuesday, Friday and Saturday, respectively.

        "content": "Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) MP Eran Wickramaratne has stated that Sri Lankas financial crisis cannot be addressed merely by revenue raising measures, without the implementation of cost cutting and efficiency increasing measures. Issuing a statement in this regard, the former State Minister of Finance noted that while government revenue needs to be increased, resolving one financial problem by creating further financial problems is not prudent. Speaking on the recent tax revisions, Wickramaratne stated that taxing those earning over Rs. 250,000 per month on a progressive basis must be considered, adding that the value of the tax-free threshold of Rs. 250,000 has halved within a year, owing to runaway inflation. Particularly food inflation, which is near 100, the SJB MP said, emphasizing that it would be unwise to lower the tax-free threshold. Speaking of the numerous employees within various sectors, Wickramaratne asserted that these people have already been taxed by inflation, and that pushing them into government dependency would be unacceptable and self-defeating. The Government must focus on addressing real issues and not push those who live and work with dignity in to dependency by irrational and impractical tax measures, he said in this regard. Below is the relevant statement issued by the MP;",

        "title": "Disney plans to cut 7,000 jobs and reward shareholders",
        "date": "February 9, 2023 02:36 pm",
        "content": "Disney said it would cut 7,000 jobs from its global workforce, part of a multibillion-dollar cost-cutting initiative aimed at streamlining the companys operations in a period of media industry turmoil. Disney had about 220,000 workers as of October 1, of which approximately 166,000 were employed in the United States. A cut of 7,000 jobs represents about 3 of its global workforce. While this is necessary to address the challenges were facing today, I do not make this decision lightly, said CEO Bob Iger, who returned to lead the company in November when the board fired Bob Chapek as the companys leader. I have enormous respect and appreciation for the talent and dedication of our employees worldwide, and Im mindful of the personal impact of these changes. Iger also took steps to reward shareholders, while Disney employees will feel pain from the job cut announcement. The company had suspended its dividend payments during the pandemic. Iger announced it expects that to return. Now that the pandemic impacts to our business are largely behind us, we intend to ask the board to approve the reinstatement of a dividend by the end of the calendar year, he said. Our cost-cutting initiatives will make this possible. And while initially, it will be a modest dividend, we hope to build upon it over time. Cost cutting efforts The job cuts come as part of a cost-cutting effort also announced Wednesday. Iger said the company is aiming for 5.5 billion of cost savings across the company, with 2.5 billion of that coming from annual savings in non-content operations. Content operations refers to business units such as movies and television shows. It said 50 of the cost savings would come from marketing expenses, 30 from labor savings and 20 of the cost savings would come from less spending on technology, procurement and other expenses. Since Disney is a major advertiser, a 1 billion reduction in annual marketing expenditures signals more difficulties ahead for other media, as well as tech companies. The sweeping job cuts were announced by Iger after the company released better than expected financial results for the fourth quarter of 2022. Disney revenue in the quarter rose 8 to 23.5 billion, edging past estimates of 23.4 billion from analysts surveyed by Refinitiv. Earnings per share, while slightly lower than a year ago, shot past forecasts, coming in at 99 cents excluding special items. Thats down from the 1.06 per share it earned on that basis a year earlier, but far better than the forecast of 78 cents a share. The company said the results were helped by strong box office showings, including for the hit Avatar: The Way of Water, and exceptionally robust theme park revenue. Drop in Disney subscribers and losses The company reported that it lost Disney streaming subscribers in the last quarter, but also managed to trim its losses from the previous three-month period. Disney cut the marketing expenses for streaming, and also adjusted pricing plans in an effort to attract more profitable subscribers. The number of subscribers was down only 1, to 162 million from 164 million, at the end of the quarter that ended October 1. But its other streaming businesses, including ESPN and Hulu, in which it has a stake, both had subscriber numbers rise 2. That helped Disney to trim it losses in the overall streaming segment to 1.1 billion in the quarter, down from 1.5 billion in the quarter ending October 1, although it was nearly double the 593 million loss it reported a year earlier. Disneys streaming services, highlighted by its Disney offering, had been reporting increases in both subscribers and losses in recent quarters. The company reaffirmed its guidance that Disney remains on course to be profitable in the next fiscal year, which runs from October through September 2024, although it cautioned that could be affected by an economic downturn. With consumers cutting the cord on cable services, the need for a money-making streaming offering is seen as critical. Disney had profited for years from cable subscriber fee revenue. Iger said increased attention to improving profitability in the streaming business does not mean that the company is moving away from it as a key to its future. The streaming business, which I believe is the future and has been growing, is not delivering basically the kind of profitability or bottom line results that the linear business delivered for us over a few decades, he said, referring to programming on television or in movie theaters. He said that streaming remains our 1 priority. It is, in many respects, our future, but were not going to abandon the linear or the traditional platforms while they can still be a benefit to us and our shareholders. Shares of Disney (DIS) jumped 6 in after-markets trading following the announcement of cost cutting and the return of the dividend. Shares of Disney (DIS) lost 43 of their value in 2022, but are up nearly 22 since Igers return was announced in November, through Wednesdays close. That is far better than the overall market but behind the gains in the same period at some other media companies, such as Netflix (NFLX) or Warner Bros. Discovery, the owner of CNN. Iger lays out his plans This was Igers first quarterly report since returning as CEO. While he had previously announced some changes, many investors had been looking to this quarterly earnings for clarity on Disneys strategic direction going forward. Iger announced that he will be combining all its media and content businesses globally, including streaming, into a new segment to be known as Disney Entertainment. He said the reorganization is a key to a return of creativity to the center of the company. And he took shots at the way the company had been structured under Chapek. Our company is fueled by storytelling and creativity, he said. Ive always believed that the best way to spur great creativity is to make sure that people who are managing the creative processes feel empowered. Therefore, our new structure is aimed at returning greater authority to our creative leaders and making them accountable for how their content performs financially. Our former structure severed that link and it must be restored. He also dismissed the idea that Disney would move to get rid of ESPN, as some have suggested in the past. Source - CNN -Agencies",

        "date": "February 9, 2023 03:57 pm",
        "content": "Rescuers pulled more survivors from beneath the rubble of collapsed buildings Thursday, but hopes were starting to fade of finding many more people alive more than three days after a catastrophic earthquake and series of aftershocks hit Turkey and Syria, killing more than 16,000. Emergency crews working through the night in the city of Antakya were able to pull a young girl, Hazal Guner, from the ruins of a building and also rescued her father, Soner Guner, two hours later, news agency IHA reported. As they prepared the man to be loaded into an ambulance, rescue crews told him that his daughter was alive and they were taking him to the same field hospital for treatment. I love you all, he faintly whispered to the rescue team. In Diyarbakir, east of Antakya, rescuers freed an injured woman from a collapsed building in the early morning hours but found the three people next to her in the rubble dead, the DHA news agency reported. In addition to 12,873 people killed in Turkey, the countrys disaster management agency said more than 60,000 have been injured. On the Syrian side of the border, 3,162 have been reported dead and more than 5,000 injured. Tens of thousands are thought to have lost their homes. In Antakya, former residents of a collapsed building huddled around an outdoor fire overnight into Thursday, wrapping blankets tightly around themselves to try and stay warm. Serap Arslan said many people remained under the rubble of the nearby building, including her mother and brother. She said machinery only started to move some of the heavy concrete on Wednesday. We tried to clear the debris on our own, but unfortunately our efforts have been insufficient, the 45-year-old said. Selen Ekimen wiped tears from her face with gloved hands as she explained that both her parents and brother were still buried. Theres been no sound from them for days, she said. Nothing. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan was scheduled to travel Thursday to the quake-hit provinces of Gaziantep, Osmaniye and Kilis amid ongoing criticism that the governments response has been too slow. Experts said the survival window for those trapped under the rubble or otherwise unable to obtain basic necessities was closing rapidly. At the same time, they said it was too soon to abandon hope. The first 72 hours are considered to be critical, said Steven Godby, a natural hazards expert at Nottingham Trent University in England. The survival ratio on average within 24 hours is 74, after 72 hours it is 22 and by the fifth day it is 6. According to the disaster management agency, more than 110,000 rescue personnel were now taking part in the effort and more than 5,500 vehicles, including tractors, cranes, bulldozers and excavators had been shipped. The task is monumental, however, with thousands of buildings toppled by the earthquake. Erdogan, who faces a tough battle for reelection in May, acknowledged problems with the emergency response to Mondays 7.8-magnitude quake, but said the winter weather had been a factor. The earthquake also destroyed the runway at Hatays airport, further disrupting the response. It is not possible to be prepared for such a disaster, Erdogan said as he visited the hard-hit province of Hatay on Wednesday. We will not leave any of our citizens uncared for. He also hit back at critics, saying dishonorable people were spreading lies and slander about the governments actions. The disaster comes at a sensitive time for Erdogan, who faces an economic downturn and high inflation. Perceptions that his government mismanaged the crisis could hurt his standing. He said the government would distribute 10,000 Turkish lira (532) to affected families. Teams from more than two dozen countries have joined the local emergency personnel in the effort. But the scale of destruction from the quake and its powerful aftershocks was so immense and spread over such a wide area that many people were still awaiting help. The region was already beset by more than a decade of civil war in Syria. Millions have been displaced within Syria itself, and millions more have sought refuge in Turkey. In Syria, aid efforts have been hampered by the ongoing war and the isolation of the rebel-held region along the border, which is surrounded by Russia-backed government forces. Syria itself is an international pariah under Western sanctions linked to the war. The earthquakes toll has already outstripped that of a 7.8-magnitude quake in Nepal in 2015, when 8,800 died. A 2011 earthquake in Japan triggered a tsunami, killing nearly 20,000 people. Source - The Associated Press -Agencies",

Along with lyricist Hal David, he also wrote numerous movie themes including Whats New, Pussycat, Alfie, and The Look Of Love, a major hit for Dusty Springfield. Bacharach died on Wednesday at home in Los Angeles of natural causes, his publicist Tina Brausam said. Known for his airborne melodies and sumptuous orchestral arrangements, Bacharach was one of the most important songwriters of the 20th Century. Over his career, he scored 73 Top 40 hits in the US and 52 in the UK, working with artists including Dionne Warwick, Frank Sinatra, The Beatles, Barbara Streisand, Tom Jones, Aretha Franklin and Elvis Costello. His music touched multiple genres, from cool jazz and rhythm and blues, to bossa nova and traditional pop - but they shared one thing in common: you could recognise them within a couple of notes. It was a style inspired by his tutor, French jazz musician Darius Milhaud. His observation was: Never be ashamed of something thats melodic, one could whistle, Bacharach recalled, having met the composer while studying at Californias Music Academy of the West in the 1940s. So that was a valuable lesson I learned from him. Never forgot that one. Never be afraid of something that you can whistle. Source - BBC -Agencies",

        "content": "Former International Monetary Fund (IMF) Resident Country Representative for Sri Lanka, Dr. Nadeem Ul Haque says that the Sri Lankan government needs to take steps to ensure efficiency when it plots the way forward for the country and cut down on the number of subsidies given to the public as well. He made these remarks while speaking during a panel discussion At HydePark on Ada Derena 24. Joining the panel discussion, Economist Dr. Tissa Jayaweera added that even though economic experts like to call for debt forgiveness it is not something that will be done by countries giving out money generated by their people to countries that have misappropriated such funds. In response to a question raised, during the discussion whether Sri Lanka is on track to get the IMF assistance, the former IMF resident coordinator to the island emphasized that the addiction of obtaining debts must stop and that Sri Lanka needs serious policy planning. IMF programme will not lift you from your issues, he said. Speaking further, Dr. Nadeem Ul Haque questioned as to why would the world forgive a country for wasting money, highlighting that this requires a large global consensus. If debt forgiveness is given, question is how you will prevent it. We have a debt issue because we wasted the money, he added. World doesnt give subsidies to the extent Sri Lanka does, Dr. Ul Haque claimed.",

        "date": "February 10, 2023 08:28 am",
        "content": "The International Monetary Fund said its approval for a 2.9 billion loan to bail out crisis-riddled Sri Lanka will depend on the island nation securing assurances on debt relief from its bilateral creditors. Sri Lanka continues to engage with official bilateral creditors to obtain financing assurances and also continues to advance domestic reforms, an IMF spokesperson said in a statement on the progress of its Extended Fund Facility to the South Asian nation. As soon as adequate assurances are obtained and remaining requirements are met, including by the Sri Lankan authorities, the EFF arrangement for Sri Lanka can be presented to the IMFs Executive Board for approval. The Paris Club - an informal group of rich western creditors  and India have provided formal support to the multilateral lender for the loan recast, leaving China  Sri Lankas biggest lender  as a holdout. China, which accounts for about 52 of the bankrupt nations bilateral debt, has instead offered term extensions, while urging others to adopt a similar approach. Access to funds will boost foreign-currency reserves that are barely above 2 billion and help the nation curb sky-high inflation, steer its 81 billion economy toward recovery after facing the worst recession since independence. Sri Lanka has about 50 billion in foreign currency debt, of which about 10 billion is mainly split between China, Japan and India, according to government data as of December.

        "title": "Turkey-Syria earthquakes: Hope fades for survivors as death toll tops 20,000",
        "date": "February 10, 2023 08:52 am",
        "content": "Cold, hunger and despair gripped hundreds of thousands of people left homeless after the earthquakes that struck Turkey and Syria three days ago as the death toll passed 20,000 on Thursday. The rescue of a 2-year-old boy after 79 hours trapped in the rubble of a collapsed building in Hatay, Turkey, and several other people raised spirits among weary search crews. But hopes were fading that many more would be found alive in the ruins of towns and cities. The death toll across both countries has now surpassed the more than 17,000 killed in 1999 when a similarly powerful earthquake hit northwest Turkey. A Turkish official said the disaster posed very serious difficulties for the holding of an election scheduled for May 14 in which President Tayyip Erdogan has been expected to face his toughest challenge in two decades in power. With anger simmering over delays in the delivery of aid and getting the rescue effort underway, the disaster is likely to play into the vote if it goes ahead. The first U.N. convoy carrying aid to stricken Syrians crossed over the border from Turkey. In Syrias Idlib province, Munira Mohammad, a mother of four who fled Aleppo after the quake, said: It is all children here, and we need heating and supplies. Last night we couldnt sleep because it was so cold. It is very bad. Hundreds of thousands of people in both countries have been left homeless in the middle of winter. Many have camped out in makeshift shelters in supermarket car parks, mosques, roadsides or amid the ruins, often desperate for food, water and heat. Some 40 of buildings in the Turkish city of Kahramanmaras, epicentre of the tremor, are damaged, according to a preliminary report by Turkeys Bogazici University. ROADSIDE CAMPFIRES At a gas station near the Turkish town of Kemalpasa, people picked through cardboard boxes of donated clothes. In the port city of Iskenderun, Reuters journalists saw people huddled round campfires on roadsides and in wrecked garages and warehouses. Authorities say some 6,500 buildings in Turkey collapsed and countless more were damaged. The death toll in Turkey rose to 17,406, Health Minister Fahrettin Koca said. In Syria, already devastated by nearly 12 years of civil war, more than 3,300 people have died, according to the government and a rescue service in the rebel-held northwest. In the devastated Syrian town of Jandaris, Ibrahim Khalil Menkaween walked in the rubble-strewn streets clutching a white body bag. He said he had lost seven members of his family, including his wife and two of his brothers. Im holding this bag for when they bring out my brother, and my brothers young son, and both of their wives, so we can pack them in bags, he said. The situation is very bad. And there is no aid. Turkish officials say some 13.5 million people were affected in an area spanning roughly 450 km (280 miles) from Adana in the west to Diyarbakir in the east. In Syria, people were killed as far south as Hama, 250 km from the epicentre. Rescue crews looked for survivors at the site of a collapsed building in the dark in the city of Adiyaman with temperatures below freezing, Turkish broadcasters showed. Teams frequently called for silence, asking all vehicles and generators to be turned off and reporters to keep quiet as they listened for sounds of anyone alive under the concrete blocks. There were still some signs of hope. A 2-year-old boy was picked out of the rubble by a Romanian and Polish rescue team in Hatay 79 hours after the earthquake, video released by Turkeys Humanitarian Relief Foundation (IHH) on Thursday showed. The boy, wearing a blue, white and black striped sweater, cried as he was gently lifted from the hole where he had been trapped. He was carried away on a blanket. No other details were immediately available. Another video from IHH showed a helmeted and dust-streaked rescuer weeping with emotion after successfully freeing a little girl from the rubble of a collapsed building in Kahramanmaras. Many in Turkey have complained of a lack of equipment, expertise and support to rescue those trapped - sometimes even as they could hear cries for help. After facing criticism over the initial response, Erdogan said on a visit to the area on Wednesday that operations were now working normally and promised no one would be left homeless. Nevertheless, the disaster will pose an additional challenge to the long-ruling president in the election. Greece sent thousands of tents, beds and blankets on Thursday to help those left homeless by the quake, in an act of solidarity with a neighbour that is a NATO ally but also a historic foe. Israeli satellite intelligence was helping map the disaster zones in Turkey with mapping capabilities predominantly used for special operations, the Israeli military said. SYRIA OVERWHELMED In Syria, relief efforts are complicated by a conflict that has partitioned the country and wrecked its infrastructure. The U.N. aid convoy entered Syria at the Bab Al Hawa crossing - a lifeline for accessing opposition-controlled areas where some 4 million people, many displaced by the war, were already relying on humanitarian aid. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres pushed for more humanitarian access to northwestern Syria, saying he would be very happy if the United Nations could use more than one border crossing to deliver help. The Syrian government views the delivery of aid to the rebel-held northwest from Turkey as a violation of its sovereignty and territorial integrity. Syrian civil defence said at least 2,030 people were killed in opposition-held northwest Syria, and the government has reported 1,347 deaths. Syrias ambassador to the United Nations on Wednesday admitted the government lacked capability and equipment but blamed the war and Western sanctions. Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has chaired emergency meetings on the earthquake but has not addressed the nation in a speech or news conference. Source: Reuters -- Agencies",

And now, a new development has baffled scientists. A huge part of the Sun broke off of its surface and created a tornado-like swirl around its North Pole. Though scientists are trying to analyse how this occurred, the video of the development has stunned the space community. The remarkable phenomenon was caught by NASAs James Webb telescope and shared on Twitter by Dr Tamitha Skov, a space weather forecaster, last week. The Sun keeps emitting solar flares (called prominence) that sometimes affect communications on Earth, hence scientists are more concerned about the latest development. Talk about Polar Vortex! Material from a northern prominence just broke away from the main filament  is now circulating in a massive polar vortex around the north pole of our Star. Implications for understanding the Suns atmospheric dynamics above 55 degrees here cannot be overstated! Dr Skov said in a tweet last week. According to NASA, the prominence is a large bright feature extending outward from the Suns surface. There have been several such instances in the past but this one has stumped the scientific community. More observations of the SolarPolarVortex reveal it took roughly 8 hours for material to circumnavigate the pole at approximately 60 degree latitude. This means an upper bound in the estimation of horizontal wind speed in this event is 96 kilometers per second or 60 miles a second! Dr Skov said in a subsequent tweet. Solar physicist Scott McIntosh of the US National Centre for Atmospheric Research, who has been observing the Sun for decades, told Space.com that he had never seen a vortex like the one that occurred when a piece of the prominence broke away and was whipped into the solar atmosphere. Space scientists are now analyzing the strange event to gather more details about it and present a clearer picture. Source - NDTV - Agencies",

        "content": "The lack of proper childcare (daycare) regulations in Sri Lanka, which is also in most instances unaffordable and viewed with mistrust, is a great hindrance to the female labour force participation of the country, Verité Research says. This was disclosed at the Select Committee of Parliament to look into and report to Parliament its recommendations to ensure gender equity and equality with special emphasis on gender-based discrimination and violation of womens rights in Sri Lanka. The panel was chaired by Dr. Sudarshini Fernandopulle. Verité Research, presenting facts before the committee, further stated that as a result of the ongoing economic crisis, more women are compelled to take up paid labour. However, it was disclosed that limited opportunities for re-entry and lack of gender-sensitive corporate policies, rigid gender norms and lack of spousal support in addition to childcare support also constrain women from their ability to participate in the labour force. Addressing the Committee, Dr. Fernandopulle stated that provisions to regulate childcare services are imperative, ensuring that the committee would look into it. The Select Committee of Parliament also discussed the Promotion of Equality and Prevention of Unfair Discrimination Bill which was proposed to the Committee by the Westminster Foundation for Democracy (WFD) and Centre for Policy Alternatives (CPA). Given that the proposals presented were broad, the committee was of the view that the contents of the proposed Bill be forwarded to the Ministry of Justice, Prison Affairs and Constitutional Reforms for consideration. Furthermore, the committee took into account the progress of the proposed Bills entitled Establishment of a National Commission on Women, the Bill on Gender Equality and the Bill on Empowerment of Women. Accordingly, the officials present stated that the Bills are expected to be presented in Parliament soon. Furthermore, it was agreed to launch the draft National Policy on Gender Equality and Womens Empowerment on the 08th of March to mark International Womens Day 2023.",

        "date": "February 11, 2023 10:59 am",
        "content": "An initial shipment of 600 metric tons of fortified rice funded by the US Agency for International Development (USAID) arrived in Sri Lanka last week to support the Government of Sri Lankas national school meal program. Through ongoing initiatives as well as new funding and food shipments, the United States is working with the Government of Sri Lanka, the WFP, and other partners to address these needs, the US embassy in Colombo said in a press release. According to a Crop and Food Security Assessment Mission report by the UNs World Food Program (WFP) and the Food and Agriculture Organization, nearly thirty percent of the Sri Lankan population is currently facing food insecurity. The US embassy stated that this shipment of fortified rice is part of a larger food assistance initiative by USAID and WFP that includes 3,950 metric tons of fortified rice, 768 metric tons of red lentils, 1,188 metric tons of soya, and a planned 2,310 metric tons of maize. This assistance will help provide school meals and nutritional supplements for 1.7 million children as well as 300,000 pregnant and lactating mothers. US-SL relations celebrate 75 years this year, and ours has been a story of friendship and partnership, said U.S. Ambassador to Sri Lanka Julie Chung. The American people swiftly responded when Sri Lankas economic crisis reduced access to nutritional food for many Sri Lankans, including children and mothers. This shipment reflects our continued commitment to the people of Sri Lanka. The US has announced more than 270 million in new support to Sri Lanka over the last year. As one of Sri Lankas longstanding development partners, we recognize how critical daily vital micronutrient intake is for young people. Therefore, child and maternal feeding programs were one of USAIDs very first assistance interventions in Sri Lanka, more than six decades ago, said Gabriel Grau, USAID Mission Director for Sri Lanka and Maldives. We are grateful for USAIDs assistance, which has enabled WFP to rapidly expand its emergency operation to reach the most food-insecure communities, said Abdur Rahim Siddiqui, WFP Sri Lanka Representative and Country Director. The latest shipment of fortified rice funded by USAID will support the continuation of the school meal program while providing children with added nutrients through a mix of iron and folic acid, relieving parents who are struggling to provide healthy meals to their families. Pregnant and lactating mothers will receive Thriposha  a nutrition intervention in Sri Lanka that provides a combination of energy, protein, and micronutrients as a ready-to-eat cereal, the US embassy added. This initiative is one component of the longstanding partnership between the American and Sri Lankan people to promote economic prosperity and democratic good governance for all Sri Lankans.",

        "content": "US President Joe Biden has said he does not believe the suspected Chinese spy balloon that flew over US airspace was a major security breach. Mr Biden told news programme Noticias Telemundo on Thursday that he does not regret how he handled the situation. The balloon was shot down over the Atlantic after it had travelled across the US. Some lawmakers have criticised the president for not destroying it sooner. Its not a major breach, Mr Biden said, adding that it was a violation of international law. Its our airspace. And once it comes into our space, we can do what we want with it. He said the military was concerned that destroying the craft over land would have put people on the ground at risk. They made a wise decision. They shot it down over water, theyre recovering most of the parts, and theyre good, he said. Speaking to the BBC, White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said it would be difficult to say how the US might handle another situation like this one. Im certainly not going to get into how the intelligence community or the Pentagon moves forward with this programme and how they assess, she said. On Thursday, the House of Representatives passed a non-binding resolution calling the balloon a brazen violation of US sovereignty, a move dismissed by China as purely political manipulation and hyping up. China is strongly dissatisfied with this and firmly opposes it, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning told reporters on Friday. The balloon first entered US airspace on 28 January over Alaska and was shot down last weekend off the coast of South Carolina, where its pieces are still being salvaged by the US Navy. China has denied the balloon was used for spying purposes, saying it was a weather device gone astray. The US, however, said the balloon is part of a fleet of surveillance balloons that have flown over five continents. The balloon incident has strained US-China relations, with Secretary of State Antony Blinken last week cancelling a planned trip to Beijing. It would have been the first high-level meeting of American and Chinese officials there in years. China said it has also refused a call from US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin after the US shot down the balloon. Source - BBC - Agencies",

Addressing the event, he noted that the belief the countrys economy would reinvigorate soon is confirmed by introducing such a brand-new vehicle to the market at a critical moment like this. He also extended special thanks to Abans Company and Hyundai Company for the launch of the vehicle. The President further said that the positive confidence the foreign countries have placed in Sri Lanka is evident through the introduction of the locally-assembled Hyundai Grand i10 vehicle to the market. This vehicle is assembled in a factory equipped with sophisticated modern technology in Seeduwa in a cooperate venture by Abans Auto Company of Sri Lanka and Hyundai Motor Company of Korea. President Wickremesinghe further said that this was a huge step in the domestic vehicle assembling industry and vehicle spare parts manufacturing industry. Speaking further, the Head of State said popular decisions would not serve to develop a country while expressing hopes that political leaders would take difficult and unpopular decisions in the future for the sake of the country. He also urged political leaders to dedicate themselves to building the country. With regard to the recent tax revision which sparked a backlash in the country, President Wickremesinghe explained taxes were imposed with the full knowledge of the difficulties faced by the people and those decisions had to be taken to run the countrys economy. However, relief can be provided to the people very soon as this adversity will only last a short time, he continued, adding that We must advance the country.

Accordingly, AASL reported that although the incident should have been reported to the Police and Air Force, this was not done by the officers present at the scene. Instead, the bullets had been handed over to the driver of the arrestee. On 29 January, a 44-year-old businessman was arrested at the Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) by officers of AASL for being in possession of 50 9mm bullets. The businessman subsequently showed proof of having a license to carry the said ammunition, and was later allowed to proceed with his travels to Singapore, while the bullets were reportedly handed over to his driver. As per the due procedures, however, the AASL officers were required to inform either the police or the Air Force of such a incident, which, AASL noted that they failed to do, adding that only 10 rounds of bullets can be carried when travelling as per the terms of the relevant license. Accordingly, an internal investigation is due to be held in this regard, while the reason as to why the businessman was carrying so many bullets is yet to be determined.",

While commenting on the assistance Sri Lanka has received by India thus far, including the USD 04 million provided during the economic crisis in 2022 and Indias financial assurances to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) pertaining to Sri Lankas USD 2.9 billion bailout, Dr. Murugan revealed that Premier Modi has an idea to introduce a scholarship for 100 children from low-income families in the Northern Province, thereby further extending Indias assistance to Sri Lanka.",

        "date": "February 11, 2023 07:51 pm",
        "content": "Preparations are under way in New Zealand for a severe storm that threatens to hit parts of the country already damaged by deadly flooding. Cyclone Gabrielle is expected to hit the countrys North Island from Saturday night - potentially bringing strong winds and further heavy rain. Residents have been told to ensure they have enough supplies to last three days in case they are trapped at home. The storm comes weeks after torrential rain inundated the city of Auckland. Tens of thousands of sandbags have been distributed there due to concerns the sodden ground and weakened infrastructure have made homes more vulnerable to flooding. Evacuation shelters have been set up once again and Air New Zealand, the national carrier, has cancelled several domestic flights ahead of the cyclones arrival. Photographs and videos posted on social media showed long queues at supermarkets and bare shelves as people prepared for more severe weather. Local media have reported that New Zealands most northern region, Northland, has already begun to experience high winds. Cyclone Gabrielle has been downgraded from a category three storm to a category two, meaning less destructive winds are now expected. However, forecasters have warned that they could still be strong enough to damage trees and power lines and that enough rain could fall to cause further flooding and landslides in the coming days. The Coromandel Peninsula and the TairāwhitiGisborne region, which were also affected by the recent torrential rain, have been placed under the most serious weather alert. Residents in flood-prone areas have been told to prepare to evacuate. Theres a degree of nervousness and anxiety around this coming event, the Thames-Coromandel districts mayor, Len Salt, told the Stuff news website. Coromandel people are pretty resilient, but the fact weve been in this mode dealing with storm events from the beginning of January...people are tired. Meanwhile, the Australian Bureau of Meteorology has said that conditions on the remote territory of Norfolk Island have begun to deteriorate because of Cyclone Gabrielle. The island, which lies north of New Zealand, has also been placed under a red alert. Residents have been warned to stay indoors and to find the strongest part of their homes under which to take shelter. Its getting hectic, resident Alex McGillycuddy told ABC News, adding that the wind has become so strong it was hard to stand up outside. Some of the people here, they havent seen anything like this and theyve been here 25 years, he said. Only three cyclones have come within a 50km (31 mile) range of the island in the past 30-40 years.

Accordingly, a programme to feed the horses with local grains such as green gram, chickpeas and corn was implemented after they were unable to import the required feed, owing to Sri Lankas dollar crisis. The inability to import the feed required for the horses ultimately led to them losing weight and becoming emaciated, the Mounted Police Division stated. However, with the recent program, there has been an evident increase in the weight of the horses, albeit gradually, the Division stated.",

        "date": "February 11, 2023 10:43 pm",
        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe has claimed that the attitude and commitment of the people of Sri Lanka also plays a role in the economic development of the island nation. Speaking at an event held in Jaffna yesterday (10 Jan.), which focused on the issues faced by those in the Northern Province, Wickremesinghe stated that the rate of Sri Lankas economic development depends depends on the attitude and commitment of the people. He said this while acknowledging that the Northern Province had made extensive contributions to the national economy prior to the War, and assured that the development programs required to restore the strong economy of the North would be implemented. The economy of Jaffna completely collapsed due to the war. It has not yet reached the anticipated level of economic development. Therefore, we hope to work under a 10-year plan to bring the country to that stage. Therefore we have to get not only foreign aid but also aid from the diaspora to realize this end, the Head of State said. Northern Province Governor Jeevan Thyagarajah, Presidential Secretary Saman Ekanayake, Northern Province Presidential Coordinating Secretary M Ilangovan, former Member of Parliament Vijayakala Maheswaran and other officials were present at this occasion. Below is an extract of the speech made by President Wickremesinghe pertaining to the programmes expected to be implemented in the North; In the Fertilizer Provision Program, our attention was drawn to provide fertilizer only for paddy cultivation. We would take steps to provide fertilizers for other crops as well in the future. Most of the people who joined the discussion spoke on those problems that required to be solved. There are many issues that could be solved within a short period of time. Although it is difficult to provide solutions for them this year due to the existing critical situation in the country, we would focus on them in the future. We have to work a plan to recover from todays economic collapse. We have to pay back the debts that we have already taken. In addition we have got to get foreign loans this year for the countrys future. They should also be paid back. In addition it is required to maintain a foreign exchange surplus. Therefore, our expectation is to develop an export-oriented economy as well as a competitive economy. To achieve this target, we have selected some major provinces out of which the Northern Province is one. If that program would be implemented properly, the economy of the Northern Province would change commendably turning to be a major economy. Accordingly, our first effort is to see the agriculture in the North-Central and Eastern provinces being modernized. Our ambition is to get 06, 07 metric tons of harvest per acre from the paddy cultivation from Kilinochchi to Kumana area and in the area from there to Udawalawe. Thus, when paddy production increases in those areas, land in other areas will be available for other investments. In addition, a program is required to make the fishing industry commercially viable. Not only the traditional fishing industry, but shrimp farming should also be prioritized. We are negotiating with the Indian government to solve the bottom trawling problem at hand. Additionally special attention has been drawn to provide a solution to the water issue in the Northern Province. It has been proposed to commence a water project combining Malwatu Oya and Yodha Ala, and also another to conserve water in other rivers and streams. Additionally, I would like to remind you that we have a program in the agenda to provide clean water to Elephant Pass Lagoon and to develop Poonareen Lake. There is also a program to boost tourism industry in this province. Another to install solar panels in the tanks and we have explored the possibility of producing green hydrogen. We can generate a surplus of 30-40 megawatts from the beach extending from Puttalam to Mullaitivu and in the beaches in Hambantota. The investigations on them are in progress. The future lies with green ammonia and green hydrogen production. Most of it would come from the Northern Province and that can turn the economy of the North completely transforming to be a strong economy. In addition, we want to promote tourism between Mannar and Trincomalee. Small shipping lines services will also commence to these islands. Tourists visit traditional Hindu temples. It is also necessary to mention that measures are being taken to establish industrial zones in Mankulam and Paranthan. Moreover, we also have plans to establish Non-government University in this region. By bringing technical institutions to this area, it is possible to turn this into a technical area where knowledge is available. And our plan is to make Punerin a new city. My expectation with all these activities is to speed up the development of the North. Also, we should implement Trincomalee port development activities with the help of India, which will strongly affect the development of the Northern Province. Before the war, the Northern Province made a wide contribution to the countrys economy. As a government, we hope to restore that situation and raise it rapidly. Reconciliation alone will not solve these problems. Poverty in the country should be eradicated and a better future should be built for the youth. Otherwise there will be no permanent solution to this problem. Also, we must eliminate the drug issue from this province. I would like everyone to discuss the implementation of those programs at the grassroots level together. A government alone cannot accomplish this. We will provide support and accordingly I request you all to work together with dedication. Those people should undertake the development of Ruhuna with the support of the government. Each province should take responsibility for the development of their own province. Lets hold a competition between 09 provinces a game which would develop the country finally.",

        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe has instructed the government officials to take the necessary measures to purchase a kilo of paddy at a guaranteed price of Rs. 100. The President further said that the Northern Province and Jaffna District will be developed as a province capable of supplying food to Sri Lanka, the Presidents Media Division (PMD) reported. These remarks were revealed by President Ranil Wickremesinghe this morning (Feb. 12) while attending the Northern Province harvest ceremony at Paranthan in Jaffna, according to the PMD. The President also inquired about the problems related to paddy cultivation from the farmers of the Paranthan area and assured that immediate solutions will be provided to those problems, it said. President Ranil Wickremesinghe further said: The government promptly provided the required fertilizers to the farmers. Therefore, we believe that there will be a surplus of paddy harvest in the Maha Season. Accordingly, arrangements are being made for the government to purchase a kilo of paddy at a guaranteed price of Rs. 100. Many people are currently experiencing financial difficulties. Even if yields increase, there is a segment of the population that lacks the financial means to purchase rice. Therefore, we are implementing a program to provide 10 kilos of rice free of charge to 2 million families during March and April. Then by the Sinhala New Year season, they would have received 20 kilos of rice. Currently, approximately 03 metric tons of paddy is received per hectare. We require a minimum of six metric tons of rice per hectare. If possible, we hope to increase it to 07 metric tons. The government is working to provide the necessary facilities to achieve that target. More methods of purchasing and storing paddy will be developed in the future. We intend to build small and medium-sized rice mills. We will be able to succeed in those activities in the next two years. We have planned to provide the necessary water facilities for this area. We are working to restore the Punarin Lake. Iranamadu Lake has now been prepared. We are working to transform the Jaffna district and the Northern Province into a province that is capable of producing enough food to feed the country once more. In addition to this, we hope to take steps to start the production of animal feed. Minister of Fisheries Douglas Devananda, Presidents Senior Adviser on National Security and Chief of Staff Sagala Ratnayake, Presidents Secretary Saman Ekanayake, former Member of Parliament Vijayakala Maheswaran, Chief of Defence Staff General Shavendra Silva, Inspector General of Police C.

        "date": "February 12, 2023 12:14 pm",
        "content": "A U.S. F-22 fighter jet shot down an unidentified cylindrical object over Canada on Saturday, the second such instance in as many days, as North America appeared on edge following a week-long Chinese spying balloon saga that drew the global spotlight. Separately, the U.S. military also scrambled fighter jets in Montana to investigate a radar anomaly that triggered a brief federal closure of airspace. Those aircraft did not identify any object to correlate the radar hits, the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) said in a statement. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau first announced Saturdays shootdown over the northern Yukon territory, saying Canadian forces would recover and analyze the wreckage. Canadian Defence Minister Anita Anand declined to speculate about the origin of the object, which she said was cylindrical in shape. She stopped short of calling it a balloon but said it was smaller than the Chinese balloon shot down off South Carolinas coast a week ago, though similar in appearance. Aloft at 40,000 feet (12,200 m), it posed a risk to civilian air traffic and was shot down at 3:41 EST (2041 GMT), she added. There is no reason to believe that the impact of the object in Canadian territory is of any public concern, Anand told a news conference. The Pentagon said NORAD detected the object over Alaska late on Friday. U.S. fighter jets from Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, Alaska, monitored the object as it crossed over into Canadian airspace, where Canadian CF-18 and CP-140 aircraft joined the formation. A U.S. F-22 shot down the object in Canadian territory, using an AIM 9X missile following close co-ordination between U.S. and Canadian authorities, Pentagon spokesman Brig. Gen. Patrick Ryder said in a statement. U.S. President Joe Biden authorized the U.S. military to work with Canada to take down the high-altitude craft after a call between Biden and Trudeau, the Pentagon said. The White House said Biden and Trudeau agreed to continue close coordination to defend our airspace. The leaders discussed the importance of recovering the object in order to determine more details on its purpose or origin, it said in a statement. A day earlier, Biden ordered another shootdown of an unidentified flying object near Deadhorse, Alaska. On Saturday, the U.S. military remained tight-lipped about what, if anything, it had learned as recovery efforts were underway on the Alaskan sea ice. On Friday, the Pentagon offered only a few details, such as that the object was the size of a small car, was flying at about 40,000 feet (12,200 m), could not maneuver and appeared to be unmanned. U.S. officials have been trying to learn about the object since it was first spotted on Thursday. We have no further details at this time about the object, including its capabilities, purpose, or origin, Northern Command said on Saturday. It mentioned difficult Arctic weather conditions, including wind chill, snow, and limited daylight that can hinder search and recovery. Personnel will adjust recovery operations to maintain safety, it added. On Feb. 4, a U.S. F-22 fighter jet brought down what the U.S. government called a Chinese surveillance balloon off the coast of South Carolina following its week-long journey across the United States and portions of Canada. China has said it was a civilian research vessel. Some U.S. lawmakers criticized Biden for not shooting down the Chinese balloon sooner. The U.S. military had recommended waiting until it was over the ocean, for fear of injuries from falling debris. U.S. personnel have been scouring the ocean to recover debris and the undercarriage of electronic gadgetry since the shootdown of the 200-foot (60-meter) -tall Chinese high-altitude surveillance balloon. The Pentagon has said a significant amount of the balloon had already been recovered or located, suggesting American officials may soon have more information about any Chinese espionage capabilities aboard. Sea conditions on Feb. 10 permitted dive and underwater unmanned vehicle (UUV) activities and the retrieval of additional debris from the sea floor, Northern Command said. The public may see U.S. Navy vessels moving to and from the site as they conduct offload and resupply activities. Source - Reuters -Agencies",

However, there is no need for India to be concerned as at no point will the island nation let the Indian interests be undermined, Ali Sabry said. Sri Lankas strong relationship is part of its civilization and will not permit any activity that poses a threat to Indias internal security to happen on its soil, he added. MFA Ali Sabry was speaking to the media in Keralas Kochi after attending a private function. His comments come at a time when the Sino-Indian relationship remains tense over conflicts in the Himalayan region. India need not worry... The Srilankan relationship with India is very strong, it is a part of civilization. We will not allow anything that will harm Indias internal security in our region. China is also our friend, we need to deal with them and work with them. However, Indian interests will not be undermined. We have made it very clear to the Indian government, he said. Ali Sabry further said that the two countries are like a family and when issues arise, they will be sorted out like in a family. You will always have issues like in a family. We will talk to each other and resolve them. Your honourable fisheries minister is in Colombo right now. Our minister would have met him for dinner yesterday. We will look into it and try to come to a permanent solution. You shouldnt worry about it, he said. The statement can also be read in the context of the Sri Lankan Navy being often accused of assaulting and even arresting Indian fishermen, especially from Tamil Nadu.

        "date": "February 12, 2023 02:21 pm",
        "content": "The body of a 64-year-old Sri Lankan female, who was living in Turkey and reported missing after last weeks earthquake, has been identified by her daughter, the Sri Lankan Embassy in Turkey said. The deceased woman who is from Galagedara in Kandy District had left for Turkey around 20 years ago, according to the Sri Lankan Embassy in Turkey. Ambassador Hasanthi Urugodawatte Dissanayake said: The Sri Lankan lady who was missing in the Kahramanmaraş area has now been found to be dead. In fact for three days her daughter was also in the area and the embassy was coordinating with the Sri Lankan pastor who had saved his life in the Kahramanmaraş area. And we coordinated with them and AFAD so that they can go to the location that the building was and to start the debris removal process. The earlier debris removal did not happen on certain places where they thought survivors could not be found. But then with utmost effort, the body was found this morning under the debris and her daughter identified the remains, she said. The Ambassador expressed her deepest condolences to the daughter and her family. She said the embassy is working with everyone including authorities to arraign the final rites for the deceased. Earlier, Sri Lankas Ambassador in Turkey stated that all 13 of the 14 Sri Lankans believed to be in the earthquake-affected areas of Turkey were safe and that they have already been traced. The deceased woman, who had lived in a building that had collapsed in the quake, was not there when the incident occurred and has not been contacted, Ambassador Hasanthi Urugodawatte Dissanayake had told Ada Derana on February 06. The ambassador had also appealed to the members of the public to convey any information about Sri Lankans living in Turkey. According to the Sri Lankan embassy, the woman had been in touch with her daughter and a friend. She has been in a building that has collapsed, but later it was thought that all in the building has come out; then there was information that her mobile phone was discovered. The embassy said it has reached out to ASAD (Disaster and Emergency Management Agency under the Turkish Presidency) to assist in this regard. A massive earthquake of a magnitude of 7.8 struck southern Turkey and northwest of Syria in the early hours of Monday (Feb. 06) while freezing cold weather added to the plights of the victims. It was followed by a multitude of aftershocks and a second powerful quake of a magnitude of 7.5. The death toll from the earthquake on both sides of the border in Turkey and Syria is currently over 28,000 while over 86,000 have been evacuated from the earthquake area.",

        "date": "February 12, 2023 03:42 pm",
        "content": "The Department of Motor Traffic has revealed that over 700,000 vehicles identified to be in the category and brand of vehicles with faulty airbags, which have been recalled by the manufacturers, are currently in operation in Sri Lanka. The Commissioner General of Motor Traffic, Nishantha Anuruddha Weerasinghe states that relevant measures are underway to recall those vehicles from the owners, following discussions with local vehicle dealers. The Department of Motor Traffic mentions that several models of cars and SUVs have been identified to be in operation within the island, in which the said fault of the airbag can be fatal to the driver. Furthermore, the relevant department confirms that although many other countries have recalled certain models of vehicles with such faulty airbags and the issues have been fixed so far, those vehicles are still running on the roads in Sri Lanka with no inspection. Recently, a scientist from the Sri Lanka Institute of Nanotechnology (SLINTEC) was killed in a road accident at Kumbuka in Gonapola, Horana on February 03, whereas it was later uncovered that the death was caused by a fault in the airbag of the vehicle. Police said the 37-year-old, who was returning home in his car, died after his car hit a concrete post of a road barrier. His car had toppled and he was killed when a metal shard of the airbag that had been activated upon impact, caused grievous injuries leading to his death, according to police. Following this tragedy, local vehicle dealers who have sold vehicles of similar models to that of the deceased scientist have recalled those vehicle models for an Air Bag system upgrade. Accordingly, the Commissioner General of Motor Traffic noted that 47 categories of vehicle models have been identified with such faulty airbag, and that measures have been taken to recall those vehicles from the owners, after obtaining information from the local vehicle dealers regarding the vehicle owners.",

        "date": "February 12, 2023 05:09 pm",
        "content": "One of South Africas hottest rap artists, Kiernan Forbes, known as AKA, has been shot dead outside a restaurant in the southeastern city of Durban, his family said Saturday. The 35-year-old won multiple South African awards, was nominated several times for a Black Entertainment Television (BET) Award in the United States, and was once nominated for an MTV Europe Music Award. It is with extreme sadness that we acknowledge the passing of our beloved son, his parents Tony and Lynn Forbes said in a statement posted on AKAs Twitter account. Our son was loved, and he gave love in return. He was gunned down on Friday night alongside another man while they were walking towards their car from a restaurant, along one of Durbans most popular roads. They were allegedly approached by two armed suspects who walked to them from across the street and shot the victims at close range, police said in a statement. He was booked to perform at a club Friday night, according to Durban city mayor Mxolisi Kaunda. Some six hours before his murder, AKA had tweeted about his upcoming album Mass Country which was due to be released later this month. Ill be doing video calls, chats, exclusive snippets and all things great as we move towards the 24th of Feb. Chat soon!!! he wrote on Twitter on Friday afternoon. The motive of the shooting is unknown, and police are investigating. Beauty Dlulane, who heads a parliamentary committee on arts and culture, condemned AKAs murder, describing it as a hit. She called on authorities to protect South Africans from this new scourge of what seems to be contract and revenge killings where performing artists and DJs seem to be targeted. High murder rates Last November, a star of the house music sub-genre Amapiano, Oupa Sefoka -- known as DJ Sumbody -- was killed alongside his bodyguard in a drive-by shooting in Johannesburg. South African gun violence famously claimed the lives of one of Africas most beloved international artists. In 2007, reggae singer Lucky Dube was dropping off his teenage son at a relatives home when gunmen shot him three times at close range during a botched hijacking. South Africa has one of the worlds highest murder rates. Many people have licensed firearms for personal protection and there are many more illegal guns in circulation. Last year the country recorded several mass shootings at taverns, while eight people were shot dead at a birthday party last month. Gun Free SA, a lobby and advocacy charity fighting to prevent gun violence in South Africa, estimates that 30 people are shot and killed each day in the country. Minister of Justice Ronald Lamola has called for the arrest and prosecution of the perpetrators. Source - AFP -Agencies",

        "content": "More than 17,400 employees in the tech industry have lost jobs in the month of February globally to date, with many workers in India receiving pink slips amid deepening global macroeconomic conditions. In 2023 so far, around 340 companies have laid off more than 1.10 lakh employees worldwide, and there appears to be no respite from job cuts. Major companies which commenced layoffs this month include Yahoo, BYJUs, GoDaddy, GitHub, eBay, Autodesk, OLX Group and others. In January, close to 1 lakh of them lost jobs in the month of January globally, dominated by companies like Amazon, Microsoft, Google, Salesforce and others, according to layoff.fyi, a website that tracks job cuts globally. More than 3,300 tech employees lost jobs daily on an average by more than 288 companies worldwide in January alone. More job cuts are likely coming in days to come amid recession fears. After firing 11,000 employees in November last year, Meta (formerly Facebook) is reportedly planning to reduce headcount further in its year of efficiency. Aviation giant Boeing is slashing 2,000 jobs in finance and HR verticals this year and the company outsources about a third of those jobs to Tata Consulting Services (TCS) in Bengaluru. In 2022, over 1,000 companies laid off 154,336 workers, as per the data by layoffs tracking site Layoffs.fyi. So far, more than 2.5 lakh tech employees have lost jobs. Source - IANS -Agencies",

        "content": "Sri Lankan customs have seized 206 live star tortoises, which are listed as an endangered species, that were being smuggled to Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia yesterday (Feb. 11) at the Air Cargo Exports Terminal of Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) in Katunayake. The officials of the Biodiversity, Cultural and National Heritage Protection Division of Sri Lanka Customs had managed to seize the six boxes labelled as dried seafood in which the live tortoises were packed, and stuffed inside cloth sacks. It is reportedly the largest seizure since mid-2015 when a bid to smuggle 124 tortoises was foiled. The customs officials pointed out that Sri Lankan star tortoises are the same species (Geochelone elegans) as that found in India and Pakistan but have a specific geographic identity. It is one of the most beautiful tortoise species found in the world and due to the same reason they have been highly sought after in the illegal pet trade, especially in the South East Asian countries, they added. As a result, the species has become threatened with extinction and included in the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List of species and also in Appendix I of the Convention of International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), the officials added. According to Fauna and Flora Protection Ordinance (section 40), an attempt to export any mammal, bird, reptile, amphibian, fish, coral or invertebrate, eggs, among others without the permission of the Director General of the Wildlife Conservation Department is an offence and also simultaneously violates the Customs Ordinance, the officials expressed. --With agencies inputs",

        "date": "February 12, 2023 08:45 pm",
        "content": "Rescuers pulled more survivors from rubble on Sunday, six days after one of the worst earthquakes to hit Turkey and Syria, as Turkish authorities sought to maintain order across the disaster zone and started legal action over some building collapses. With chances of finding more survivors growing more remote, the toll in both countries from Mondays earthquake and major aftershocks rose above 28,000 and looked set to keep growing. It was the deadliest quake in Turkey since 1939. Displaced residents in the Turkish city of Kahramanmaras, near the epicentre, said they had set up tents as close as they could to their damaged or destroyed homes in an effort to prevent them from being looted. Facing questions over his response to the earthquake as he prepares for a national election that is expected to be the toughest of his two decades in power, President Tayyip Erdogan promised to start rebuilding within weeks. In Syria, the disaster hit hardest in the rebel-held northwest, leaving many homeless for a second time after they were displaced by a decade-old civil war, though the region has received little aid compared to government-held areas. We have so far failed the people in north-west Syria, United Nations aid chief Martin Griffiths tweeted from the Turkey-Syria border, where only a single border crossing is open for U.N. aid supplies. They rightly feel abandoned, Griffiths said, adding that he was focused on addressing that swiftly. In Turkeys southeastern province of Hatay, a Romanian rescue team carried a 35-year-old man named Mustafa down a pile of debris from a building, broadcaster CNN Turk said, about 149 hours after he was buried by the quake. His health is good, he was talking, said one of the rescuers. He was saying, Get me out of here quickly, Ive got claustrophobia. SECURITY FEARS AND DETENTION ORDERS Two German rescue organisations suspended work in Turkey on Saturday, citing reports of clashes between groups of people and highlighting concerns for security in the quake-hit areas. Gizem, a rescue worker from the southeastern province of Sanliurfa, said she had seen looters in the city of Antakya. We cannot intervene much, as most of the looters carry knives. One elderly resident of Kahramanmaras said that gold jewelry in his home had been stolen, while in the port city of Iskenderun police had deployed at junctions of commercial streets with many phone and jewelry shops. Erdogan has warned that looters will be severely punished. Building quality in a country which lies on several seismic fault lines has come into sharp focus in the aftermath of the quake. Vice President Fuat Oktay said that 131 suspects had so far been identified as responsible for the collapse of some of the thousands of buildings flattened in the 10 affected provinces. We will follow this up meticulously until the necessary judicial process is concluded, especially for buildings that suffered heavy damage and buildings that caused deaths and injuries, he said. Along the main road leading into the city of Antakya, where the few buildings left standing had large cracks or caved-in facades, traffic occasionally halted as rescue teams called for silence to detect signs of remaining life under the ruins. The earthquake hit as Erdogan faces presidential and parliamentary elections scheduled for June. Even before the disaster, his popularity was falling due to soaring inflation and a slumping Turkish currency. Some people affected by the quake and opposition politicians have accused the government of slow and inadequate relief efforts early on, and critics have questioned why the army, which played a key role after a 1999 earthquake, was not brought in sooner. Erdogan has acknowledged problems, such as the challenge of delivering aid despite damaged transport links, but said the situation had been brought under control. He has called for solidarity and condemned negative politicking. SYRIA AID HELD UP In Syria, the hostilites that have fractured the country during 12 years of civil war are now hindering relief work. Earthquake aid from government-held regions into territory controlled by hardline opposition groups has been held up by approval issues with Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) which controls much of the region, a U.N. spokesperson said. An HTS source in Idlib told Reuters the group would not allow any shipments from government-held areas and that aid would be coming in from Turkey to the north. Turkey has opened all the roads and we wont allow the regime to take advantage of the situation to show they are helping, the source said. An aid convoy from Syrias Kurdish-led northeastern region carrying fuel and other aid was also turned back on Thursday from the northwest, where Turkey-backed rebels reign. The European Unions envoy to Syria on Sunday urged authorities in Damascus to engage in good faith with aid workers. It is important to allow unimpeded access for aid to arrive in all areas where it is needed, Dan Stoenescu said. The quake ranks as the worlds seventh deadliest natural disaster this century, its toll approaching the 31,000 from a quake in neighbouring Iran in 2003. It has killed 24,617 inside Turkey, and more than 3,500 in Syria, where tolls have not been updated since Friday. Turkey said about 80,000 people were in hospital, with more than 1 million in temporary shelters. Source - Reuters -Agencies",

Mudalige was arrested on 22 August 2022, on charges filed under the PTA, and was released from these charges on January 31 after being detained for 162 days under the PTA, by Colombo Chief Magistrate Prasanna Alwis, on the grounds that the accused was not found to have committed any offices under the PTA. The IUSF conveners legal counsel had previously requested his release on the grounds that there were no sufficient levels of facts or evidence to remand him under the PTA. Many international human rights organizations including Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch had also been calling on the Sri Lankan government to end the arbitrary detention of Mudalige, who was under arrest for five months. However, Sri Lanka Police said last week that they have decided to file an appeal against the recent release of Wasantha Mudalige from the charges filed against him under the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA).

        "content": "Harshitha Samarawickrama and Nilakshi de Silvas ice-cool hundred partnership steered Sri Lanka to a seven-wicket win over Bangladesh as they continued their winning start to the ICC Womens T20 World Cup 2023. Sri Lanka were reduced to 26 for three in the powerplay but Samarawickramas assured knock of 69 not out, coupled with De Silvas unbeaten 41 at the other end, ensured Chamari Athapaththus side made it two wins in the space of three days at Newlands. Bangladesh posted a total of 126 for eight in Cape Town as Oshadi Ranasinghes fine spell of three for 23 restricted them to a below-par total. Laser-precise seamer Marufa Akter ripped through the Sri Lankan top order but Samarawickrama and De Silva steadied the ship to claim Sri Lankas first ever back-to-back wins at a Womens T20 World Cup and extend their impressive start in Group A. Bangladesh won the toss and elected to bat in Cape Town  but it was Sri Lanka who landed the first blow in dramatic fashion. Opening batter Murshida Khatun was run out after facing just a single delivery from a fabulous direct hit from Inoka Ranaweera at short fine leg. Sobhana Mostary and wicketkeeper Shamima Sultana set about laying the foundations for the innings before Shamima was stumped by opposite number Anushka Sanjeewani off the bowling of Ranasinghe for 20. That brought Bangladesh captain Nigar Sultana to the crease, who helped construct a patient partnership alongside No.3 Sobhana. But it ended inside the 10th over when Sobhana was bowled by Athapaththu for 29. Bangladesh were struggling to manufacture any form of meaningful partnership and wickets continued to fall at regular intervals throughout the innings. Shamima succumbed to Ranasinghe for 28 before the off-spinner claimed her third victim by getting Lata Mondal stumped for 11. That left Shamimas side with considerable work to do during the final five overs, but Shorna Akter, Ritu Moni and Nahida Akter were all dismissed cheaply to leave them with a total of 126 for eight at the halfway stage. Sri Lanka may have fancied their chances setting out in pursuit of a chaseable-looking target  but Marufu had other ideas after being handed the ball by Shamima under the Cape Town lights. The accurate seamer remarkably removed Athapaththu, Vishmi Gunaratne and Sanjeewani without conceding a single run in her spell, tearing through the Sri Lankan top order to leave them reeling at 26 for three inside the powerplay. But that brought the composed duo of Samarawickrama and De Silva to the crease, who set about the recovery mission with alacrity and continued to chip away at the total. And they showed no signs of letting their ever-increasing grip on the game slip, bringing up their hundred partnership in the 19th over and guiding their country to a historic second win on the spin at Newlands. Sri Lanka beat Bangladesh at Cape Town by seven wickets Bangladesh 126 for eight in 20 overs (Sobhana Mostary 29, Nigar Sultana 28; Oshadi Ranasinghe 323, Chamari Athapaththu 219) Sri Lanka 1293 in 18.2 overs (Harshitha Samarawickrama 69 not out, Nilakshi de Silva 41 not out; Marufa Akter 323) Source: ICC --Agencies",

Meanwhile, the United Motors Lanka PLC has issued a special notice for the MITSUBISHI vehicle owners regarding the faulty airbag replacement free of charge. The recalled vehicle models include Montero, Lancer and L 200. In addition, the Stafford Motor Company has also informed the HONDA vehicle owners that the company has recalled for an airbag system update for several models of vehicles. The Department of Motor Traffic yesterday (Feb. 12) revealed that over 700,000 vehicles identified to be in the category and brand of vehicles with faulty airbags, which have been recalled by the manufacturers, are currently in operation in Sri Lanka. The Commissioner General of Motor Traffic, Nishantha Anuruddha Weerasinghe stated that relevant measures are underway to recall those vehicles from the owners, following discussions with local vehicle dealers. The Department of Motor Traffic mentions that several models of cars and SUVs have been identified to be in operation within the island, in which the said fault of the airbag can be fatal to the driver. Furthermore, the relevant department confirmed that although many other countries have recalled certain models of vehicles with such faulty airbags and the issues have been fixed so far, those vehicles are still running on the roads in Sri Lanka with no inspection. Recently, a scientist from the Sri Lanka Institute of Nanotechnology (SLINTEC) was killed in a road accident at Kumbuka in Gonapola, Horana on February 03, whereas it was later uncovered that the death was caused by a fault in the airbag of the vehicle. Following this tragedy, local vehicle dealers who have sold vehicles of similar models to that of the deceased scientist have recalled those vehicle models for an Air Bag system upgrade. Accordingly, the Commissioner General of Motor Traffic noted that 47 categories of vehicle models have been identified with such faulty airbag, and that measures have been taken to recall those vehicles from the owners, after obtaining information from the local vehicle dealers regarding the vehicle owners.",

        "title": "US jets down 4 objects in 8 days, unprecedented in peacetime",
        "date": "February 13, 2023 12:41 pm",
        "content": "A U.S. fighter jet shot down an unidentified object over Lake Huron on Sunday on orders from President Joe Biden. It was the fourth such downing in eight days and the latest military strike in an extraordinary chain of events over U.S. airspace that Pentagon officials believe has no peacetime precedent. Part of the reason for the repeated shootdowns is a heightened alert following a spy balloon from China that emerged over U.S. airspace in late January, Gen. Glen VanHerck, head of NORAD and U.S. Northern Command, said in a briefing with reporters. Since then, fighter jets last week also shot down objects over Canada and Alaska. Pentagon officials said they posed no security threats, but so little was known about them that Pentagon officials were ruling nothing out  not even UFOs. We have been more closely scrutinizing our airspace at these altitudes, including enhancing our radar, which may at least partly explain the increase, said Melissa Dalton, assistant defense secretary for homeland defense. U.S. authorities have made clear that they constantly monitor for unknown radar blips, and it is not unusual to shut down airspace as a precaution to evaluate them. But the unusually assertive response was raising questions about whether such use of force was warranted, particularly as administration officials said the objects were not of great national security concern and the downings were just out of caution. VanHerck said the U.S. adjusted its radar so it could track slower objects. With some adjustments, weve been able to get a better categorization of radar tracks now, he said, and thats why I think youre seeing these, plus theres a heightened alert to look for this information. He added: I believe this is the first time within United States or American airspace that NORAD or United States Northern Command has taken kinetic action against an airborne object. Asked if officials have ruled out extraterrestrials, VanHerck said, I havent ruled out anything at this point. The Pentagon officials said they were still trying to determine what exactly the objects were and said they had considered using the jets guns instead of missiles, but it proved to be too difficult. They drew a strong distinction between the three shot down over this weekend and the balloon from China. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz tweeted that airmen in the 148th Fighter Wing, an Air National Guard fighter unit in Duluth, shot down the object over Lake Huron. The extraordinary air defense activity began in late January, when a white orb the officials said was from China appeared over the U.S. and hovered above the nation for days before fighter jets downed it off the coast of Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. That event played out over livestream. Many Americans have been captivated by the drama playing out in the skies as fighter jets scramble to shoot down objects. The latest brought down was first detected on Saturday evening over Montana, but it was initially thought to be an anomaly. Radar picked it up again Sunday hovering over the Upper Peninsula of Michigan and it was going over Lake Huron, Pentagon officials said Sunday. U.S. and Canadian authorities had restricted some airspace over the lake earlier Sunday as planes were scrambled to intercept and try to identify the object. According to a senior administration official, the object was octagonal, with strings hanging off, but had no discernable payload. It was flying low at about 20,000 feet, said the official who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive matters. Meanwhile, U.S. officials were still trying to precisely identify two other objects shot down by F-22 fighter jets, and were working to determine whether China was responsible as concerns escalated about what Washington said was Beijings large-scale aerial surveillance program. An object shot down Saturday over Canadas Yukon was described by U.S. officials as a balloon significantly smaller than the balloon  the size of three school buses  hit by a missile Feb. 4. A flying object brought down over the remote northern coast of Alaska on Friday was more cylindrical and described as a type of airship. Both were believed to have a payload, either attached or suspended from them, according to the officials who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity to discuss the ongoing investigation. Officials were not able to say who launched the objects and were seeking to figure out their origin. The three objects were much smaller in size, different in appearance and flew at lower altitudes than the suspected spy balloon that fell into the Atlantic Ocean after the U.S. missile strike. The officials said the other three objects were not consistent with the fleet of Chinese aerial surveillance balloons that targeted more than 40 countries, stretching back at least into the Trump administration. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer told ABCs This Week that U.S. officials were working quickly to recover debris. Using shorthand to describe the objects as balloons, he said U.S military and intelligence officials were focused like a laser on gathering and accumulating the information, then compiling a comprehensive analysis. The bottom line is until a few months ago we didnt know about these balloons, Schumer, D-N.Y., said of the spy program that the administration has linked to the Peoples Liberation Army, Chinas military. It is wild that we didnt know. Eight days ago, F-22 jets downed the large white balloon that had wafted over the U.S. for days at an altitude of about 60,000 feet. U.S. officials immediately blamed China, saying the balloon was equipped to detect and collect intelligence signals and could maneuver itself. White House officials said improved surveillance capabilities helped detect it. Chinas Foreign Ministry said the unmanned balloon was a civilian meteorological airship that had blown off course. Beijing said the U.S. had overreacted by shooting it down. Then, on Friday, North American Aerospace Defense Command, the combined U.S.-Canada organization that provides shared defense of airspace over the two nations, detected and shot down an object near sparsely populated Deadhorse, Alaska. Later that evening, NORAD detected a second object, flying at a high altitude over Alaska, U.S. officials said. It crossed into Canadian airspace on Saturday and was over the Yukon, a remote territory, when it was ordered shot down by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. In both of those incidents, the objects were flying at roughly 40,000 feet. The object on Sunday was flying at 20,000 feet. The cases have increased diplomatic tensions between the United States and China, raised questions about the extent of Beijings American surveillance, and prompted days of criticism from Republican lawmakers about the administrations response.

        "date": "February 13, 2023 02:01 pm",
        "content": "The Consul General of Sri Lanka in Shanghai Anura Fernando claims that although Sri Lanka is included in the pilot program of China partially lifting the ban on international group travel, Chinese tourists havent shown much interest in Sri Lanka, since most of them havent travelled out of the country in three years. So far, not much. We are expecting them to return soon. Their particular interest has been to other countries, which are closer to China, since most Chinese havent travelled for three years out of the country. So, they are taking a look at closer destinations. But I think Sri Lanka should be attractive to most Chinese travellers, because of Buddhism. Many Buddhist sites are located there. And theres the tea that is grown there, as well as jewellery and beaches, he said. Joining an interview on the CGTN television network in China, the Sri Lankan Consul General in Shanghai also highlighted that the Chinese are very familiar with the country, since the country has attracted large investments in Sri Lanka. We are expecting them to return soon, he said. Furthermore, Mr. Fernando expressed that the tourist numbers in Sri Lanka will increase to around one million this year. Commenting on the bilateral trade ties between China and Sri Lanka, Mr. Fernando stated that Sri Lanka hopes to sign the free trade agreement with China this year, which will open up more trade between the two countries. In response to a question raised regarding the current progress of Colombo Port City, a development with large investments from China, Mr. Fernando pointed out that its operations will commence in one to two years, since the construction of the buildings has already been re-commenced. He also highlighted that an international financial centre is being launched in Colombo Port City. Due to the pandemic, it slowed down. Most people working there returned home and they are coming back to the port city. We are launching an international financial centre. Now the construction of buildings has started, within the next year or two, it will start to operate. There is a port called the Hambantota Port, which was built by the China Merchant state-owned Chinese company. Its complete and in operation. And there are some land sites available in what we call the free trade zone and a few Chinese industries are operating there. Thats part of the Belt and Road Initiative, he added. -With agencies inputs",
