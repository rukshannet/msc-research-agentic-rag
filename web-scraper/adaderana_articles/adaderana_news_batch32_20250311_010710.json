        "date": "June 18, 2023 10:21 pm",
        "content": "Minister of Trade Nalin Fernando has requested that the prices of all bakery products be reduced by Rs. 10. Speaking at a media briefing held on Sunday (18 June), Fernando requested all relevant bakery owners to reduce the prices of all bakery products by Rs. 10. Moreover, he also noted that if, in the future, local wheat flour companies intend to increase the prices of their products, it must first be approved by the Consumer Affairs Authority (CAA). Responding to the Minister, however, Chairman of the All Ceylon Bakery Owners Association N. K. Jayawardena stated that such a reduction would not be possible, as the prices of other ingredients required for the manufacturing of bakery products have not reduced owing to the depreciation of the Sri Lankan Rupee. Meanwhile, the National Organiser of the All-Island Canteen Owners Association Asela Sampath has called for a control price on both wheat flour and all related bakery products. Speaking in this regard, he assured the continued support of his union in the event such a control price is introduced.",

        "content": "More than 300 Pakistani nationals have been killed in the sinking of a packed trawler off the coast of Greece, the latest tragedy to expose the refugee crisis confronting the European Union as tens of thousands seek sanctuary from war, persecution and poverty. The chairman of of Pakistans Senate, Muhammad Sadiq Sanjrani, disclosed the numbers in a statement Sunday, sending condolences to grieving families of the dead. Our thoughts and prayers are with you, and we pray that the departed souls find eternal peace, Sanjrani said. This devastating incident underscores the urgent need to address and condemn the abhorrent act of illegal human trafficking. Greek authorities have yet to confirm Pakistans death toll. Pakistan is in the midst of its worst economic crisis in decades. The number of Pakistanis traversing dangerous routes to Europe in search of a better future has reverberated through the nation, prompting Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to declare Monday a national day of mourning for those who died in the boats sinking. In a tweet Sunday, he ordered a high-level inquiry into the incident. I assure the nation that those found negligent towards their duty will be held to account. Responsibility will be fixed after the inquiry and heads will roll, Sharif wrote. About 750 men, women and children were on the boat when it capsized last week, the United Nations Migration Agency (IOM) said, killing hundreds and making the tragedy one of the worst in the Mediterranean Sea, according to the EU Commissioner for Home Affairs Ylva Johansson. The tragedy has shone a spotlight on the EUs refugee crisis in which every year, tens of thousands of migrants fleeing war, persecution, climate change and poverty risk treacherous routes to Europe. Johansson condemned the role of smugglers who put people on the boats. They are not sending them to Europe, they are sending them to death. This is what theyre doing and its absolutely necessary to prevent it, she said. Source  CNN -Agencies",

        "title": "UKs new trading preferences scheme that benefits Sri Lanka now in force",
        "date": "June 19, 2023 12:38 pm",
        "content": "The United Kingdom (UK) is implementing one of the most generous preferential trading schemes in the world from today (June 19), the British High Commission in Sri Lanka announced. The UKs new Developing Countries Trading Scheme (DCTS) will replace the current Generalised Scheme of Preferences (GSP) and allows Sri Lanka to trade with the UK tariff-free on 92 percent of goods, leading to increased competitiveness of Sri Lankan products in the UK market, according to the High Commission. Sri Lanka is one of 65 countries benefiting from the UKs Developing Countries Trading Scheme (DCTS) that provides tariff reductions and simpler terms of trade. The scheme was announced last year, and legislation has now been finalised to bring it into force, the statement said. The British High Commissioner to Sri Lanka Sarah Hulton OBE said: The UK is Sri Lankas second largest export market and the DCTS demonstrates the UKs continued interest in strengthening this trade relationship. We hope that Sri Lankan exporters will broaden their opportunities with the UK by making use of the wider number of products for which tariffs have been removed. The DCTS is a tangible example of the UKs commitment to growing free and fair trade with countries like Sri Lanka, boosting economies, and supporting jobs. Speaking at the launch of the scheme, UK Minister for International Trade Nigel Huddleston said: The scheme will create opportunities for businesses around the world, supporting livelihoods, creating jobs and diversifying local and international supply chains. The DCTS allows Sri Lanka to now trade with the UK tariff-free on 92 of goods, leading to increased competitiveness of Sri Lankan products in the UK market. Sri Lanka is well positioned to supply the UK due to increasing demand for sustainable, fair-trade, and healthier products. With more flexible rules of origin it is easier for least developed countries to trade with Sri Lanka without losing tariff-free status, increasing the potential for supply chain development. To support business take-up of the DCTS, the UK Trade Partnerships programme (UKTP) has expanded and now covers Sri Lanka. UKTP provides technical assistance to almost-ready-to-export small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and is delivered by the International Trade Centre (ITC). The programme will primarily provide trade promotion technical assistance to a selected number of Sri Lankan SMEs, preparing them to participate successfully in international trade fairs. This will improve the visibility of Sri Lankan producers, equip exporters with the necessary tools and knowledge, and facilitate their entry into new markets. With a limited number of slots available, ITC will conduct a selection process for Sri Lankan SMEs who will receive support via the UK Trade Partnerships programme across identified sectors. This will be announced shortly, the British HC further said. The DCTS replaces the UK GSP and retains powers to suspend a country on the grounds of human rights and labour rights violations, and broadens these powers to include violations in relation to anti-corruption, climate change and environment conventions. It grounds all suspension decisions in the principles and obligations of international conventions.",

        "date": "June 19, 2023 03:19 pm",
        "content": "U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken met with Chinese President Xi Jinping on Monday, as the top U.S. diplomat wrapped up a high-stakes two-day visit to Beijing aimed at easing soaring tensions between the countries. The 35-minute meeting at the Great Hall of the People had been expected and was seen as key to the success of the trip, but neither side confirmed it would happen until a State Department official announced it just an hour beforehand. In footage of the meeting released by state broadcaster CCTV, Xi is heard to say The two sides have agreed to follow through on the common understandings President Biden and I have reached in Bali. In earlier meetings between Blinken and senior Chinese officials, the two sides expressed willingness to talk but showed little inclination to bend from hardened positions on disagreements ranging from trade, to Taiwan, to human rights conditions in China and Hong Kong, to Chinese military assertiveness in the South China Sea, to Russias war in Ukraine. Xi said that they had made progress and reached agreements on some specific issues without elaborating. This is very good, Xi said. I hope that through this visit, Mr. Secretary, you will make more positive contributions to stabilizing China-US relation, Xi added. Despite Blinkens presence in China, he and other U.S. officials had played down the prospects for any significant breakthroughs on the most vexing issues facing the planets two largest economies. Instead, these officials have emphasized the importance of the two countries establishing and maintaining better lines of communication. Blinken is the highest-level U.S. official to visit China since President Joe Biden took office, and the first secretary of state to make the trip in five years. His visit is expected to usher in a new round of visits by senior U.S. and Chinese officials, possibly including a meeting between Xi and Biden in the coming months. Blinken met earlier Monday with Chinas top diplomat Wang Yi for about three hours, according to a U.S. official. Chinas Ministry of Foreign Affairs wrote in a statement that Blinkens visit coincides with a critical juncture in China-U.S. relations, and it is necessary to make a choice between dialogue or confrontation, cooperation or conflict, and blamed the U.S. sides erroneous perception of China, leading to incorrect policies towards China for the current low point in relations. It said the U.S. had a responsibility to halt the spiraling decline of China-U.S. relations to push it back to a healthy and stable track and that Wang had demanded that the U.S. stop hyping up the China threat theory, lift illegal unilateral sanctions against China, abandon suppression of Chinas technological development, and refrain from arbitrary interference in Chinas internal affairs. The State Department said Blinken underscored the importance of responsibly managing the competition between the United States and the PRC through open channels of communication to ensure competition does not veer into conflict. In the first round of talks on Sunday, Blinken met for nearly six hours with Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang after which both countries said they had agreed to continue high-level discussions. However, there was no sign that any of the most fractious issues between them were closer to resolution. Both the U.S. and China said Qin had accepted an invitation from Blinken to visit Washington but Beijing made clear that the China-U.S. relationship is at the lowest point since its establishment. That sentiment is widely shared by U.S. officials. Blinkens visit comes after his initial plans to travel to China were postponed in February after the shootdown of a Chinese surveillance balloon over the U.S. A snub by the Chinese leader would have been a major setback to the effort to restore and maintain communications at senior levels. Biden and Xi had made commitments to improve communications precisely so that we can make sure we are communicating as clearly as possible to avoid possible misunderstandings and miscommunications, Blinken said before leaving for Beijing. And Biden said over the weekend that he hoped to be able to meet with Xi in the coming months to take up the plethora of differences that divide them. In his meetings on Sunday, Blinken also pressed the Chinese to release detained American citizens and to take steps to curb the production and export of fentanyl precursors that are fueling the opioid crisis in the United States. Xi offered a hint of a possible willingness to reduce tensions on Friday, saying in a meeting with Microsoft Corp. co-founder Bill Gates that the United States and China can cooperate to benefit our two countries. Since the cancellation of Blinkens trip in February, there have been some high-level engagements. CIA chief William Burns traveled to China in May, while Chinas commerce minister traveled to the U.S. And Bidens national security adviser Jake Sullivan met with senior Chinese foreign policy adviser Wang Yi in Vienna in May. But those have been punctuated by bursts of angry rhetoric from both countries over the Taiwan Strait, their broader intentions in the Indo-Pacific, Chinas refusal to condemn Russia for its war against Ukraine, and U.S. allegations from Washington that Beijing is attempting to boost its worldwide surveillance capabilities, including in Cuba. And, earlier this month, Chinas defense minister rebuffed a request from U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin for a meeting on the sidelines of a security symposium in Singapore, a sign of continuing discontent.

        "content": "The European Commission will unveil on Tuesday possible measures, such as screening of outbound investments and export controls, to keep prized EU technology from countries such as China and prevent it being put to military use by rivals. The European Union executive will present its Economic Security Strategy as a communication to EU lawmakers and countries, whose leaders are set to discuss relations with China in Brussels next week. While not a formal legislative proposal, the communication will lay out strategies the 27-nation EU should consider as it seeks to de-risk from China and avoid sensitive technology leaking out through exports or investments abroad. The Commission will need to tread carefully because granting of export licences and weighing security interests are national competences that EU governments will want to retain. A Dutch plan that effectively bars Chinese companies from buying the most advanced lithography tools of ASML, which are used to make semiconductors, is a case in point. The Dutch acted alone, but wanted restrictions throughout the EU. EU officials point out there is no clear way to do this. The EU does control exports of specified dual-use goods that can have military applications, but this does not cover emerging technologies. EU member states are not ready to hand over export controls as a whole but we will probably see something more along the lines of greater cooperation, an EU diplomat said. EU diplomats say the bloc must determine carefully what risks it wants to limit and establish that they cannot be contained by existing measures. The Commission could suggest also some form of screening of foreign students planning to study in technical fields, for which the Dutch are considering legislation. Sources - Reuters -Agencies",

The economy of the country of 22 million is expected to shrink 2 this year before returning to growth next year, the government estimates, following last years record contraction of 7.8 after foreign exchange reserves hit record lows. The International Monetary Fund approved a bailout of nearly 3 billion in March, which Sri Lanka expects will bring additional funding of up to 4 billion from the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank and other multilateral agencies. Of the proposed World Bank funding, 500 million will be for budgetary support and is likely to come in two tranches of 250 million each, one of the sources, from the World Bank, said. All four sources, from the World Bank and the Sri Lankan finance ministry, sought anonymity as they were not authorised to talk to the media. The first tranche is likely to be disbursed immediately after board approval with the next possibly in October, as the bank watches the progress of Sri Lankas debt restructuring and the first review of the IMF programme, due in September, the World Bank source added. The remaining 200 million will be earmarked for programmes to assist the poor, whose numbers have doubled to 25 of the population since the onset of the Indian Ocean nations worst economic crisis early last year, another World Bank source said. Households that have registered for support will be ranked ... and the lowest 2 million will be eligible for support, the source added. The World Bank and the finance ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Source  Reuters -Agencies",

        "title": "The Flash opens to 55 million, a step off the typical superhero pace",
        "date": "June 19, 2023 05:05 pm",
        "content": "DC and Warner Bros. long-in-the-works superhero movie The Flash opened to 55 million in its first three days in North American theaters, according to studio estimates on Sunday. Though a fair amount of money by normal standards, a sizable jump from DCs last release, the Shazam! sequel, and enough for a first place start, its also muted by superhero standards where 100 million debut weekends are almost commonplace. The weekend also saw Pixar get its worst three-day opening ever with a 29.5 million bow by Elemental. It was a crowded weekend at the multiplex overall. In addition to The Flash and Elemental, the horror-comedy The Blackening also opened wide. The only big win was Wes Andersons starry Asteroid City which earned 720,000 from just six theaters and the distinction of having the highest per-theater average (132,211) since the start of the pandemic. The Flash faced more complications than marketplace conditions. In addition to The Flash and Elemental, the horror-comedy The Blackening also opened wide. It has been in the headlines often over the past year, not because of the movie itself but because of its star Ezra Millers off-screen troubles, including arrests, erratic behavior and accusations of misconduct. Miller has apologized and said they are seeking mental health treatment. They also bowed out of participating in the normal publicity circuit, except for the premiere. The studios leadership remained bullish on releasing their 200 million movie, however, confident in its quality and importance to future DC Studios storylines. The movie introduces the multiverse, which allowed for the return of Michael Keatons Batman in a movie that also had Ben Afflecks Batman. Going into the weekend analysts expected The Flash to earn at least 70 million in its first three days, playing in 4,234 locations domestically. Now, its projected to net out with 64 million in its first four, including Mondays Juneteenth holiday. Internationally, it made 75 million, giving it a 139 million global start. I think Warners did a fantastic job of dealing with the situation they had, said Paul Dergarabedian, the senior media analyst for Comscore. Its a very interesting case study of what can happen when the title character of a huge movie has these very public controversies. But its hard to reverse engineer it to know what effect it may have had. Another obstacle was that some of the main promotional outlets  late night talk shows  are still shut down as the Writers Strike continues. Also, with the knowledge that DC is undergoing a major reset, fans might have decided to move on and wait for that. Critics were mixed but more positive than not, with a 67 on Rotten Tomatoes. APs Jocelyn Noveck wrote in her review that despite some breezily clever and entertaining moments, the final act bogs down in what feels like an endless, generic CGI battle and a kitchen-sink resolution. Audiences polled for CinemaScore only gave the film a B, which has not historically been great news for word-of-mouth potential and longevity. But there is a bit of a gap in the schedule before the next major blockbuster comes in  Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, which opens on June 30. Next weeks biggest offering is the R-rated Jennifer Lawrence comedy  No Hard Feelings  and the nationwide expansion of Asteroid City. Second place went to Elemental with an estimated 29.5 million from 4,035 locations in North America  a new low for Pixars three-day openings. Before, that title belonged to The Good Dinosaur and Onward, which both debuted to 39 million. Previous Pixar lows were The Good Dinosaur and Onward, which both debuted to 39 million. Elemental was greeted positively by critics, with a 76 on Rotten Tomatoes, and audiences (A CinemaScore). APs Jake Coyle wrote that its probably in the lower half of the Pixar cannon but sincere and clever, with a splash of dazzle, it, comes closer to rekindling some of the old Pixar magic than some recent entries.  Including 15 million from 17 international territories, Elemental launched to 44.5 million globally. Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse was a very close third, in its third weekend, with 27.8 million. Sony is projecting that its domestic total will have reached 285 million through Monday. Its possible, Dergarabedian said, that Spider-Mans formidable holding power  bolstered by reviews and word of mouth  ate into Elementals launch. Both are also rated PG. Transformers: Rise of the Beasts dropped a steep 67 in its second weekend, adding 20 million to take fourth place. The Little Mermaid settled into fifth place with 11.6 million in its fourth weekend. The Blackening was the other big release this weekend  a bit of counterprogramming to the bigger branded releases with an original horror-comedy about a group of friends, who are Black, who get together for a weekend away and find themselves on the run from a killer. Lionsgate and MRC acquired the 5 million movie from director Tim Story after it debuted to positive reviews at the Toronto International Film Festival. Released in 1,775 theaters, The Blackening made an estimated 6 million. This is a fantastic weekend for movie theaters because theres a depth and breadth of content that is amazing, but that means theyre sharing the wealth, said Dergarabedian. The collective box office was incredibly strong. But its creating a very competitive environment. Asteroid City was an undeniable bright spot in limited release. Focus Features set up Asteroid City pop-up experiences at theaters in New York and Los Angeles to help draw audiences. Wes Anderson is the pinnacle of specialty film. Hes the Marvel, said Lisa Bunnell, Focus president of distribution. This is a great shot in the arm for art theaters. Next week, Asteroid City jumps from 6 to about 1,500 theaters. After COVID, were trying to do things that are out of the box, Bunnell added. We feel like to get specialty films back on track again, you sort of need a new playbook. Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore. Final domestic figures will be released Monday. 1. The Flash, 55 million. 2. Elemental, 29.5 million. 3. Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse, 27.8 million. 4. Transformers: Rise of the Beasts, 20 million. 5. The Little Mermaid, 11.6 million. 6. The Blackening, 6 million. 7.

        "date": "June 19, 2023 06:48 pm",
        "content": "A special Swedish parliamentary defence committee said on Monday the countrys defence must focus on the threat posed by Russia and a military attack could not be ruled out. The Nordic nation has been scrambling to bolster its defences, having applied to join NATO last year as a result of Russias invasion of Ukraine, though Turkey and Hungary have so far held up Swedish entry into the Western alliance. Russias aggressive actions have led to a structural and greatly deteriorated security situation. Russia has further lowered its threshold for military use of force and exhibits a high risk propensity, the committee said in a report. The all-party committee, which is supported by security experts and deals with major issues such as security policy, said the Ukraine war could escalate into attacks on other countries or even the use of nuclear weapons or other mass-destruction arms. The preconditions for Swedish defence policy have changed fundamentally. That is a realisation about policy that Swedish citizens need to carry with them. It has consequences, committee chairman and Moderate Party MP Hans Wallmark told reporters. Like most Western states, Sweden scaled down its defence after the end of the Cold War three decades ago but has ramped military spending back up in recent years, and is due to meet NATOs threshold of 2 GDP in 2026. Swedish security and defence policy should be designed to deal with the long-term threat Russia is judged to pose to European and global security, the committee report said. An armed attack against Sweden cannot be ruled out. Deliberations will now begin to forge an agreement on long-term defence plans, including spending, with a final committee report due in April next year. Joining NATO would overturn Swedens long-time formal neutrality, although it has trained alongside NATO forces for years. Its eastern neighbour Finland, which has a long border with Russia, was admitted to NATO in April after applying alongside Sweden in response to the Ukraine war. Source - Reuters -Agencies",

        "content": "The U.N. human rights chief called on Sri Lanka to implement the recommendations of the mandate-holders of the UN Human Rights Council, which include special rapporteurs, independent experts and working groups. The 53rd session of the UN Human Rights Council convened on Monday in Geneva, Switzerland. Under the agenda Item 2 of the Council the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Turk presented the Human Rights Global Update. In his statement, the U.N. human rights chief stated that although the Sri Lankan government has regrettably rejected aspects of the UNHRCs resolutions related to accountability, it has continued to engage with the rights bodys presence on the ground. He said that Sri Lanka has received a dozen visits by mandate-holders in the past decade, and encouraged Sri Lankan authorities to implement their recommendations. In Sri Lanka, although the Government has regrettably rejected aspects of the Councils resolutions related to accountability, it has continued to engage with our presence on the ground. Sri Lanka has received a dozen visits by mandate-holders in the past decade, and I encourage the authorities to implement their recommendations, he said. Volker Turk, who took over as high commissioner in late 2022, used his opening speech to the U.N. Human Rights Council on Monday to urge greater cooperation and singled out states such as Syria, Iran, Israel and Russia that should do more. We would now like to scale up engagement, he told the Geneva council at the opening of its four-week session, saying the world was at a critical juncture 75 years after adopting the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. I also believe that it is important for us to establish a presence for the first time in China and India  two countries which together comprise more than one-third of the worlds population. More broadly, Turk had voiced concern about a strangulation of civil society in several countries, without naming them. Turk said he would like to double his offices budget to step up global monitoring although this may prove challenging given that many countries oppose further scrutiny on sovereignty grounds. Turk also called on the United States to act urgently on racial discrimination and to ratify six human rights treaties, including one on child rights. --With agencies inputs",

He said this when the High Commissioner paid a farewell call on the Premier at Temple Trees today (June 19). The Prime Minister said that the untiring efforts of the High Commissioner to further strengthen the Sri Lanka and UK bilateral partnership, were praiseworthy. During her assignment in Sri Lanka since 2019, a strong presence of the UK in Sri Lanka was maintained with engagement in diverse areas, he said. High Commissioner Sarah Hulton said in this meeting that the support extended by PM Dinesh Gunawardena during his tenure as the Minister of Foreign Affairs and the Minister of Education as well as during his tenure as the current Prime Minister was a great strength for her to successfully carry out the work to promote bilateral relations between the two countries, the PMs Office said. He welcomed the UKs decision to include Sri Lanka as a beneficiary country under the UK GSP Scheme Developing Countries Trading Scheme (DCTS), under which duty concessions will be given for 92 of Sri Lankan exports. Premier Gunawardena said Sri Lanka hopes that new investment projects will be initiated by the UK following the conclusion of the debt restructuring process and the unlocking of the IMF fund facility. He added that Sri Lanka encourages UK investment in sectors such as education, banking and financial services, ITBPM, pharmaceuticals, hospitality and tourism. The Prime Minister wished the High Commissioner Hulton every success in her future endeavours.

        "date": "June 19, 2023 11:19 pm",
        "content": "Minister of State for Finance Shehan Semasinghe today addressed the issue of false information being disseminated by various parties in the country regarding the domestic debt optimization program. During a press conference held today (19) at the Presidential Media Centre, he emphasized that the government has not made a final decision on this matter. Minister Semasinghe further emphasized the sensitivity surrounding the optimization of domestic debt and assured that the government is approaching this issue with utmost responsibility. Minister Shehan Semasinghe reaffirmed the governments dedication to achieving improved optimization in order to uphold the stability of Sri Lankas banking and financial system. His remarks were made in line with the conferences theme, Collective path to a stable country, the Presidents Media Division reported. Expressing his views, Minister Shehan Semasinghe further said; No final decision has been made yet on the domestic debt optimization program. However, as a government, we always approach sensitive issues responsibly. President Ranil Wickremesinghe also addressed the matter of domestic debt optimization in Parliament. The Central Bank and the Ministry of Finance have provided clarifications on their stance. Our focus is on finding solutions for optimizing the banking and financial system of our country without negatively impacting stability, which is crucial. Consequently, various information and announcements are being released within the country. Once the government reaches a final decision, we are prepared to inform both the parliament and the public. This is an extremely sensitive matter that significantly influences the market situation. Therefore, it is vital that we refrain from making statements that create doubts regarding this optimization, as it helps maintain stability in our financial market. We must all act responsibly in this regard. Following the Presidents visit to France, we anticipate gaining a better understanding of these issues, particularly concerning the restructuring of foreign debt. There have been criticisms on the political platforms concerning the current economic program implemented by the government. However, if the groups criticizing had a need or a plan, and possessed the capability, they would have an opportunity to confront that challenge. Only President Ranil Wickremesinghe has accepted that challenge. He has communicated to the people the progress made by the country since assuming office as President. While the leaders responsible for meeting the needs of the people fulfils their duties, those who have not taken on this responsibility continue to make various statements. Specifically, the JVP platform has expressed various opinions regarding the management of the economy. However, none of these statements present any practical ideas or programs for building the country. The aim is to find a solution to the economic crisis without relying on the intervention of the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The government seeks to address the challenges and overcome the crisis through its own program, without external financial assistance. The specific solution that does not involve the IMFs intervention is not mentioned. While there are claims of providing a solution without IMF support, it is implied that such claims may lack substance. The challenging times we have faced are gradually coming to an end, and there is a belief that better progress will be achieved through the governments program. The IMF predicts a decrease in the negative growth rate from -7.8 to -3 by the end of the year. However, the governments commitment and efforts are expected to lead to positive developments in 2024. The government has achieved more results than anticipated thus far, and it is important to maintain the commitment made by the government. The countrys progress in terms of transparency, combating corruption, and addressing fraud has gained international attention. The parliamentary week, which begins today, is expected to enhance confidence in Sri Lankas economy, administrative structure, and financial system. The Budget Office Bill and an Anti-Corruption Bill will be debated and passed in parliament, contributing to the countrys progress. Passing these bills is crucial to boost the strength of the countrys financial market and attract investments. It may also lead to a change in rating agencies opinions about Sri Lanka. The first review with the IMF in September will showcase the progress made and the current program being implemented. Alternative measures have already been taken to address the slight decrease in income levels. Overall, the economic process is being successfully implemented in the country, though it may take some more time for the people to feel its effects. As a government, we are committed to advancing this program. Any opposition or attempts to destabilize the political and social stability established can have consequences worse than those experienced during the weak economy of the previous year. Despite short-term challenges, we need everyones support to steer the country onto a new path, ensuring a clear future and preventing similar crises from occurring again. Two groups exist in the country: one that capitalizes on the peoples suffering during the economic crisis to advance their political goals, and another that genuinely supports the governments efforts to overcome the crisis. Some individuals attempt to spread misinformation and false news. As a government, we strive to provide accurate information based on correct data and statistics to enable people to make informed decisions. -PMD-",

        "date": "June 20, 2023 07:58 am",
        "content": "A rescue operation was underway deep in the waters of the Atlantic Ocean on Monday in search of a technologically advanced submersible vessel carrying five people to document the wreckage of the Titanic, the iconic ocean liner that sank more than a century ago. The vessel was reported overdue Sunday night about 435 miles (700 kilometres) south of St. Johns, Newfoundland, according to Canadas Joint Rescue Coordination Centre in Halifax, Nova Scotia. Lt. Cmdr. Len Hickey said a Canadian Coast Guard vessel and military aircraft were assisting the search effort, which was being led by the U.S. Coast Guard in Boston. Rear Adm. John Mauger, a commander for the U.S. Coast Guard, said additional resources would arrive in the coming days. It is a remote area  and it is a challenge to conduct a search in that remote area, he said. But we are deploying all available assets to make sure we can locate the craft and rescue the people on board. According to the Coast Guard, the craft submerged Sunday morning, and its support vessel, the Canadian research icebreaker Polar Prince, lost contact with it about an hour and 45 minutes later. The Polar Prince will continue to do surface searches throughout the evening and Canadian P8 Poseidon aircraft will resume their surface and subsurface search in the morning, the Coast Guard said on Twitter. The submersible was operated by OceanGate Expeditions. David Concannon, an adviser to OceanGate, said the submersible had a 96-hour oxygen supply starting at roughly 6 a.m. Sunday. In an email to The Associated Press, Concannon said he was supposed to be on the dive but could not go due to another client matter. He said officials were working to get a remotely operated vehicle that can reach a depth of 6,000 meters (about 20,000 feet) to the site as soon as possible. OceanGates expeditions to the Titanic wreck site include archaeologists and marine biologists. The company also brings people who pay to come along, known as mission specialists. They take turns operating sonar equipment and performing other tasks in the five-person submersible. The Coast Guard said Monday that there was one pilot and four mission specialists aboard. OceanGate said its focus was on those aboard and their families. We are deeply thankful for the extensive assistance we have received from several government agencies and deep sea companies in our efforts to reestablish contact with the submersible, it said in a statement. U.K. businessman Hamish Harding was one of the mission specialists, according to Action Aviation, a company for which Harding serves as chairman. The companys managing director, Mark Butler, told the AP that the crew set out on Friday. There is still plenty of time to facilitate a rescue mission, there is equipment on board for survival in this event, Butler said. Were all hoping and praying he comes back safe and sound. Harding is a billionaire adventurer who holds three Guinness World Records, including the longest duration at full ocean depth by a crewed vessel. In March 2021, he and ocean explorer Victor Vescovo dived to the lowest depth of the Mariana Trench. In June 2022, he went into space on Blue Origins New Shepard rocket. Harding was looking forward to conducting research at the Titanic site, said Richard Garriott de Cayeux, the president of The Explorers Club, a group to which Harding belonged. We all join in the fervent hope that the submersible is located as quickly as possible, he said in a statement. The expedition was OceanGates third annual voyage to chronicle the deterioration of Titanic, which struck an iceberg and sank in 1912, killing all but about 700 of the roughly 2,200 passengers and crew. Since the wreckages discovery in 1985, it has been slowly succumbing to metal-eating bacteria. Some have predicted the ship could vanish in a matter of decades as holes yawn in the hull and sections disintegrate. The initial group of tourists in 2021 paid 100,000 to 150,000 apiece to go on the trip. Unlike submarines that leave and return to port under their own power, submersibles require a ship to launch and recover them. OceanGate hired the Polar Prince to ferry dozens of people and the submersible craft to the North Atlantic wreck site. The submersible would make multiple dives in one expedition. The expedition was scheduled to depart from St. Johns, Newfoundland, in early May and finish up at the end of June, according to documents filed by the company in April with a U.S. District Court in Virginia that oversees Titanic matters. CBS journalist David Pogue, who went on the trip last year, noted his vessel got turned around looking for the Titanic. Theres no GPS underwater, so the surface ship is supposed to guide the sub to the shipwreck by sending text messages, Pogue said in a segment aired on CBS Sunday Morning. But on this dive, communications somehow broke down. The sub never found the wreck. The submersible, named Titan, is capable of diving 4,000 meters or 13,120 feet with a comfortable safety margin, OceanGate said in its court filing. It weighs 20,000 pounds (9,072 kilograms) in the air, but is ballasted to be neutrally buoyant once it reaches the seafloor, the company said. The Titan is made of titanium and filament wound carbon fiber and has proven to withstand the enormous pressures of the deep ocean, OceanGate stated. OceanGate told the court that Titans viewport is the largest of any deep diving submersible and that its technology provides an unrivaled view of the deep ocean. In a May 2021 court filing, OceanGate said the Titan had an unparalleled safety feature that assesses the integrity of the hull throughout every dive. At the time of the filing, Titan had undergone more than 50 test dives, including to the equivalent depth of the Titanic, in deep waters off the Bahamas and in a pressure chamber, the company said. During its expedition in 2022, OceanGate reported that the submersible had a battery issue on its first dive, and had to be manually attached to its lifting platform, according to a November court filing. In the high sea state, the submersible sustained modest damage to its external components and OceanGate decided to cancel the second mission for repairs and operational enhancements, the filing stated. More missions, however, followed. The company reported that 28 people visited the wreck site last year. Experts said Monday that rescuers face steep challenges. Alistair Greig, a professor of marine engineering at University College London, said submersibles typically have a drop weight, which is a mass they can release in the case of an emergency to bring them up to the surface using buoyancy. If there was a power failure andor communication failure, this might have happened, and the submersible would then be bobbing about on the surface waiting to be found, Greig said. Another scenario is a leak in the pressure hull, in which case the prognosis is not good, he said. If it has gone down to the seabed and cant get back up under its own power, options are very limited, Greig said. While the submersible might still be intact, if it is beyond the continental shelf, there are very few vessels that can get that deep, and certainly not divers. Even if they could go that deep, he doubts they could attach to the hatch of OceanGates submersible. Source: The Associated Press -Agencies",

        "date": "June 20, 2023 12:35 pm",
        "content": "Glaciers in Asias Hindu Kush Himalaya could lose up to 75 of their volume by centurys end due to global warming, causing both dangerous flooding and water shortages for the 240 million people who live in the mountainous region, according to a new report. A team of international scientists has found that ice loss in the region, home to the famous peaks of Everest and K2, is speeding up. During the 2010s, the glaciers shed ice as much as 65 faster than they had in the preceding decade, according to the assessment by the Kathmandu-based International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD), an intergovernmental scientific authority on the region. Were losing the glaciers, and were losing them in 100 years time, said Philippus Wester, an environmental scientist and ICIMOD fellow who was the lead author of the report. The Hindu Kush Himalaya stretches 3,500 km (2,175 miles) across Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, China, India, Myanmar, Nepal and Pakistan. At 1.5 degrees Celsius or 2C of warming above preindustrial temperatures, glaciers across the entire region will lose 30 to 50 of their volume by 2100, the report said. But where glaciers will melt most depends on location. At 3C of warming  what the world is roughly on track for under current climate policies  glaciers in the Eastern Himalaya, which includes Nepal and Bhutan, will lose up to 75 of their ice. At 4C of warming, that ticks up to 80. THE FULL PICTURE Scientists have struggled to assess how climate change is affecting the Hindu Kush Himalaya. Unlike the European Alps and North Americas Rocky Mountains, the region lacks a long historical record of field measurements that reveal whether glaciers are growing or shrinking. There was always some uncertainty in the Himalaya  are they really melting? said Wester. In 2019, the United States declassified spy satellite images of the regions glaciers dating back to 1970, providing a new scientific baseline. Further advances in satellite technology in the past five years, alongside bolstered field efforts, have buoyed scientists understanding of the changes underway. The report draws on data running through December 2022. While the knowledge of the Himalayan glaciers is still not as good as the Alps, its now comparable to other regions like the Andes, said Tobias Bolch, a glaciologist with Graz University of Technology in Austria unaffiliated with the report. Compared with a 2019 ICIMOD assessment of the region, theres a much higher level of confidence now in these findings, said Wester. We have a better sense of what the loss will be through to 2100 at different levels of global warming. LIVELIHOODS AT RISK With this newfound understanding comes grave concern for the people living in the Hindu Kush Himalaya. The report found water flows in the regions 12 river basins, including the Ganges, Indus, and Mekong, are likely to peak around mid-century, with consequences for the more than 1.6 billion people who depend on this supply. While it may sound like well have more water because glaciers are melting at an increased rate ... too frequently it will arise as floods instead of a steady flow, said Wester. Past peak water, supplies will eventually dwindle. Many high mountain communities use glacial water and snowmelt to irrigate crops. But the timing of when snow falls has become more erratic, and theres less than there used to be. Weve had  huge numbers of yak deaths because during summer they go to higher pastures, said report co-author Amina Maharjan, a senior specialist in livelihoods and migration at ICIMOD. If the snow falls too soon, the entire area is covered in snow and they dont have grass to graze. People are now moving away from mountain communities to earn income elsewhere, she said. Melting glaciers also pose a danger to downstream communities. Runoff pools in shallow lakes, held back by rocks and debris. The risk comes when a lake overfills, bursting through its natural barrier and sending a torrent of water rushing down mountain valleys. Governments are trying to prepare for these changes. China is working to shore up the countrys water supplies. And Pakistan is installing early warning systems for glacial lake outburst floods. Source: Reuters -Agencies",

Addressing a letter to the Speaker on behalf of the Women Parliamentarians Caucus and the Sectoral Oversight Committee on Children, Women and Gender, chairperson of the Caucus, Dr. Sudarshini Fernandopulle, stated that the Women Parliamentarians Caucus is very happy to see the inclusion of the concept of sexual bribery being addressed in the draft of the present Anti-Corruption Bill. However, Dr. Fernandopulle highlighted two priority concerns that require to be amended immediately, before debate schedule for tomorrow. The first, she noted, is that there should be a change in the offense of sexual favour. The Caucus requested that the term sexual bribery be used instead of sexual favour, as the latter diminishes the offence, while the former ensures that the gravity of the offence is reflected in the law. Secondly, Dr. Fernandopulle pointed out that the second is that due to Section 162 (f) on re-corruption, the draft bill reflects that the offence is committed by both the giver and the taker of any bribe and the person giving the bribe may be treated unfairly. Thus, the Caucus informed the speaker that they also request to include an exception in the case of sexual bribery only, where the giverofferor of the bribe is not considered the guilty party.",

The lawmaker also emphasized that this initiative would empower the Foreign Employment Bureau to thwart unnecessary interference and combat illegal activities effectively. He further revealed that under the guidance of President Ranil Wickremesinghe, the Ministry of Finance has constituted a committee to oversee the implementation of this program. Minister Nanayakkara conveyed these remarks during a press conference held at the Presidential Media Centre, focusing on the theme of Collective path to a stable country. Speaking further, he said similarly, the government is actively pursuing the digitization of the Labour Department. Currently, the tender process is underway for the digitization of the Employee Trust Fund (ETF), Employees Provident Fund (EPF), and the e-salary service. Further, the government is taking measures to introduce a licensing system that covers all professions, from labourers to doctors, he said noting that it is crucial for anyone working in the country to be registered under this system, as it allows authorities to have comprehensive information about their employment. Additionally, a program is being implemented to extend social security benefits, including ETF and EPF, to daily wage workers. Nanayakkara also said the government is initiating a nationwide program to establish a comprehensive health and safety system in workplaces, which will be enforced through legislation. Efforts are also being made to eliminate child labour, while steps are being taken to streamline the Employee Provident Fund, collecting and digitizing relevant data to ensure efficient implementation, he added. Speaking on how the scheme to grant permits to import electric vehicles has boosted government revenue, the minister said allowing foreign workers to import electric vehicles has resulted in saving 70 million for the country. This opportunity to import electric vehicles is available to anyone worldwide until September. We have already launched various welfare initiatives for foreign workers and are implementing national programs to provide vocational training for young people, creating job opportunities abroad. The first phase of this program will commence with the global fair in Jaffna next month. As only 40 of the workforce in Sri Lanka is engaged in direct employment, while the remaining 60 are in indirect employment, Nanayakkara said the government is committed to providing comprehensive benefits through a centralized fund. This includes maternity benefits, compensation in case of job loss, and accident insurance. We secure these benefits through the funds acquired from ETF and contributions from employers. These measures are implemented without any bias towards political affiliations, as the government aims to safeguard the well-being of the people of the country, the minister said, assuring that regardless of party colours, we work diligently for the betterment of the nation, ensuring that political leaders make decisions based on the welfare of the people rather than their own political future. Clarifying certain misconceptions about the much-debated Broadcasting Authority Bill, the minister said this Act does not aim to suppress the media, as the government has no intention to do so. The Broadcasting Authority Act has several key objectives, with the primary one being the protection of freedom of speech as enshrined in the Constitution. Freedom of speech is an essential right that cannot be compromised. However, it is crucial for accurate information to be disseminated, and self-censorship and responsible reporting are vital in achieving this goal. Nanayakkara pointed out that the rules and regulations of the Broadcasting Authority Act are developed in collaboration with the Association of Broadcasters, without any government interference. Journalists and media organizations are not restricted, and licenses are issued in a fair and unbiased manner. Nevertheless, it is necessary to have an independent committee to investigate and address any misinformation or damage caused by certain media outlets in the past, ensuring that such incidents are not repeated. He said the implementation of the Broadcasting Authority Act is indeed crucial to prevent the dissemination of baseless news and unfounded rumours in the media, adding that it aims to ensure responsible journalism and protect individuals from having their honour compromised. By enacting this legislation, we can maintain the integrity of news reporting and prevent the spread of false information.",

The program, recommended by the Western Provincial Sub-Committee of the Experts Committee on Dengue Control appointed by President Ranil Wickremesinghe, aims to mitigate the spread of dengue fever. Under this initiative, specific inspection days have been assigned for different types of establishments, according to the Presidents Media Division (PMD). Thus, private schools, government schools, pre-schools, private educational institutions, and higher educational institutions (universitiesPiriven) will be inspected every Monday. Construction sites will be examined on Wednesdays, factories on Tuesdays, other private institutions on Thursdays, and other government institutions on Fridays. Additionally, houses, gardens, and religious shrines will undergo inspections on weekends, with houses and gardens being examined on Saturdays and religious shrines on Sundays. The PMD said institutions requiring inspections on different days are encouraged to inform the office of the responsible Medical Officer of Health (MOH) for necessary arrangements. To ensure the effectiveness of these inspections, it is crucial that designated volunteer teams from the respective institutions carry out the inspections on the designated days. Hence, these teams should submit monthly reports to the relevant Medical Officer of Health. Meanwhile, preschool kids and schoolchildren have been advised to wear protective clothing to minimize the risk of mosquito bites until the daily reported cases of dengue are brought to a minimum. This precautionary measure aims to reduce additional expenses associated with dengue-related health issues.",

Speaking on the matter, Minister Nanayakkara said the Foreign Employment Bureau (SLBFE) had made all necessary arrangements to send this 800th group of workers for South Korean jobs. However, the South Korean Human Resources Department has informed the SLBFE not to dispatch the group on Tuesday. A similar incident was reported in May, after a SriLankan Airlines flight was delayed by 10 hours, and the South Korean Human Resources Department refused to accept a group of Sri Lankan migrant workers who were unable to reach Incheon as planned, Minister Nanayakkara explained. Although this group of migrant workers was later sent to South Korea on June 04, the flight they had boarded that day, too, had experienced a delay of nearly two hours, he said further.",

        "content": "A prison riot in a Honduran womens prison Tuesday has left at least 41 dead in what the government called a gang-led attack in retaliation to its efforts to crack down on corruption in penal facilities. Authorities are working to identify the bodies at the Centro Femenino de Adaptacion Social, a 900-person womens penitentiary around 20 kilometers (12 miles) from capital city Tegucigalpa, Yuri Mora, spokesperson for the public prosecutors office, told Reuters. Most of those killed were burned to death, while others were shot, Mora said. Another seven people were being treated at a state hospital, said a hospital spokesperson. President Xiomara Castro said the riot had been planned by gang members with guards knowledge. I will take drastic measures, she said on Twitter. Castros first move late Tuesday was to replace security minister Ramon Antonio Sabillon with national police head Gustavo Sanchez, shifting Sabillon to the foreign service. More measures will be announced Wednesday, Castros office said, to combat organized crime and dismantle the boycott against security fostered from inside prisons. The riot was likely in reaction to a government crackdown in recent months on corruption within prisons, said Julissa Villanueva, head of the penal system. A commission, formed earlier this year, has raided prisons to wrest control from powerful gangs and weed out crooked security guards. Relatives of inmates were stationed outside the prison late Tuesday seeking to find out about their loved ones. Im looking for information about what happened to my daughter, but they still havent informed us, a woman who identified herself as Ligia Rodriguez said in an interview with Honduras Channel 3 television station. Honduras has a history of deadly prison incidents, with 18 inmates reportedly killed in a gang fight in a penitentiary in 2019, and more than 350 dying in a fire in 2012. Source  Reuters -Agencies",

Work on the Chashma 5 project would begin immediately, Sharif said on state-run news channel PTV following the signing of the memorandum of understanding (MOU) between China National Nuclear Cooperation and Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission. Investment from China in this project to the tune of 4.8 billion sends a message loud and clear that Pakistan is a place where Chinese companies and investors continue to show their trust and faith, Sharif said. The Chashma 5 project will be built in the central province of Punjab. Chinas support will help Pakistan make the transition away from reliance on fossil fuels. Pakistans total nuclear energy production capacity rose to 1,400 mw, when the countrys sixth nuclear power plant opened two years ago. Located in the southern port city of Karachi, that 1,100 mw plant was also constructed with Chinese assistance. Sharif, whose government is desperately struggling to stave off a balance of payments crisis, thanked the Chinese partners for offering a 100-million discount for the latest project. It is unclear whether the new investment is part of the 65 billion that China has pledged in infrastructure building for Pakistan under its Belt and Road Initiative. The new project was originally planned to start a couple of years ago, and Sharif expressed thanks to the Chinese side for not rescheduling costs despite the long delay. Instead, he said, the Chinese had disbursed an initial 30 billion Pakistani rupees (104.53 million) to start the project. Source: Reuters -Agencies",

In his petition, the Pastor deemed the CIDs attempts to arrest him unlawful, claiming that the police have not presented any piece of evidence to the court to prove that his comments threaten the religious harmony in the country. Subsequently, however, an interlocutory petition was filed by a group including Ven. Elle Gunawansa Thero, seeking to dismiss Fernandos petition. The petitioning party claimed that the defendant has filed this petition in a backdrop where the Attorney General has pledged before the Supreme Court that an investigation would be carried out into several controversial statements against several religions including Buddhism.

        "content": "South Koreas flag carrier Korean Air is expected to resume direct flights to Sri Lanka, says Minister of Labour and Foreign Employment Manusha Nanayakkara. The minister alleges that the employment opportunities of Sri Lankan workers who are supposed to leave for foreign employment are at risk due to repeated delays of SriLankan Airlines flights. Speaking in the parliament this morning (June 21), Nanayakkara said the South Korean Human Resource Institute only accepts migrant workers who arrive in the country within the given time period, adding that it does not accept anyone who is behind schedule. The SriLankan Airlines flight UL 470, which was scheduled to take off for South Korea yesterday (June 20) with a group of migrant workers leaving for employment in South Korea had been delayed by approximately 12 hours. This aircraft was deployed mainly for the departure of these workers travelling to South Korea. Its a national requirement. Although the impact of this issue was reiterated to the respective officials of the airline, it has fallen on deaf ears, he said. The minister mentioned that they had to cancel the groups departure after the South Korean Human Resource Institute informed the Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment (SLBFE) not to send the group as the flight was delayed. Furthermore, Nanayakkara noted that until the South Korean flag carrier initiates direct flights between Sri Lanka and South Korea, the government has made a temporary plan to expatriate the workers to South Korea via Singapore. Accordingly, for the time being, they will be able to fly out to Singapore through SriLankan Airlines and board a Korean Air flight from Singapore to reach South Korea, the minister said. Owing to this temporary fix, the migrating workers will not be affected even if SriLankan Airlines flight experiences a delay of 5-6 hours, Nanayakkara said explaining that such delays can be managed as multiple flights operate from Singapore to South Korea.",

        "content": "WhatsApp has on Tuesday partnered with actor Anushka Sharma to launch a campaign which will have a series of mirrored messages appearing in private spaces - womens restrooms - in malls across Delhi. The Meta-owned messaging app believes that everyone should have a safe space to communicate with their family and friends, and so to encourage women to check in on each other privately. As part of the campaign, WhatsApp will enable disappearing messages to appear on the restroom mirrors when triggered by motion, alongside a QR code that offers suggestions for checking in via a private WhatsApp message. The launch comes after a research from YouGov, commissioned by WhatsApp, reveals that almost three quarters of women across the world (73) and 68 of women in India said that they would open up about their struggles if a friend reached out to them in private. Speaking about the campaign, actor Anushka Sharma said, Women dont always feel safe to speak up about issues theyre facing, however they tend to open up with a friend who reaches out to them, privately. Ive partnered with WhatsApp to drive awareness around the importance of having a secure space for women to confide in others and how a private conversation can be empowering for women to speak up and seek help when their safety and well-being might be at risk, she added. Vice president of Meta India, Sandhya Devanathan said, At WhatsApp, we believe protecting users personal conversations with their family and friends is the most important type of privacy we can give them. Were thrilled to add two new privacy-first features that further strengthen and add to WhatsApps built-in layers of protection to offer users a safe space to have their most private conversations. To coincide with the launch of the campaign, Mark Zuckerberg has announced a new privacy feature, Silence Unknown Callers, which helps to screen out spam, scams and calls from unknown people for greater control over your calls. WhatsApp is also rolling out another feature called Privacy Checkup, a step-by-step feature that guides users through important privacy settings on the app and helps choose the right level of protection, all in one place.

The Core Groups statement also stressed the importance of transparency, accountability, inclusivity and of building meaningfully on past work and recommendations that address the root causes of conflict and impunity. Sri Lanka should safeguard its representative democracy by maintaining voters confidence in the countrys electoral systems and ensuring the independence of its institutions and commissions, the statement read further. Welcoming Sri Lankas initial steps towards addressing concerns around land returns, long-term detentions and corruption, the Core Group said these steps can provide a basis to begin a process to protect the rights of all Sri Lankans, from all ethnic and religious communities.

        "date": "June 21, 2023 06:08 pm",
        "content": "China hit back on Wednesday after U.S. President Joe Biden referred to President Xi Jinping as a dictator, saying the remarks were absurd and a provocation, in an unexpected spat immediately following efforts by both sides to lower tensions. Bidens comments came just a day after top U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken visited Beijing to stabilize bilateral relations that China says are at their lowest point since formal ties were established. Attending a fundraiser in California, Biden said Xi was very embarrassed when a suspected Chinese spy balloon was blown off course over U.S. airspace early this year, making a personal comment on the Chinese leader when Blinken said on Monday the chapter should be closed. The reason why Xi Jinping got very upset in terms of when I shot that balloon down with two box cars full of spy equipment in it was he didnt know it was there, Biden said. Thats a great embarrassment for dictators. When they didnt know what happened. That wasnt supposed to be going where it was. It was blown off course, Biden added. Xi became Chinas most powerful leader since Mao Zedong after securing a precedent-breaking third term as president in March and head of the Communist Party in October. Biden also said China has real economic difficulties. A Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson said Bidens remarks were extremely absurd and irresponsible. Expressing Chinas strong dissatisfaction, foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said Bidens comments seriously violated facts, diplomatic protocol and Chinas political dignity. Theyre an open political provocation, she told a news conference. Asked how aware Xi had been about the balloons movements, Mao reiterated Chinas previous explanation that the passage of the balloon through U.S. airspace had been unintended and caused by circumstances beyond its control. BIG MOUTH Bidens big mouth is a loose cannon, said Wu Xinbo, director of the Center for American Studies at Fudan University in Shanghai. Mutual trust is what China has been stressing, so Bidens comments are very destructive and damaging, Wu said, while adding that the remarks may not totally undo what Blinken had achieved on his China visit. Blinken and Xi agreed in their meeting on Monday to stabilize the intense rivalry between Washington and Beijing so it did not veer into conflict. While no breakthroughs were made during the first visit to China by a U.S. secretary of state for five years, both sides did agree to continue diplomatic engagement with more visits by U.S. officials in the coming weeks and months. Biden said later on Tuesday that U.S. climate envoy John Kerry may go to China soon. A day earlier, on Monday, Biden said he thought relations between the two countries were on the right path, and he indicated that progress was made during Blinkens trip. Chiming in from Moscow, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Bidens comments contradicted the efforts of his secretary of state to ease tensions with Beijing, describing the remarks as incomprehensible. These are very contradictory manifestations of U.S. foreign policy, which speak of a large element of unpredictability, Peskov told reporters on Wednesday. However, thats their business, Peskov said. Weve our own bad relations with the United States of America and our very good relations with the Peoples Republic of China. Source - Reuters - Agencies",

        "date": "June 21, 2023 06:13 pm",
        "content": "The U.S. Supreme Court ruled on Tuesday that Disney must face a New Jersey toy creators lawsuit that claimed the company violated her trademark rights with its character Lots-o-Huggin Bear from the blockbuster 2010 film Toy Story 3. The justices threw out a lower courts ruling that Disney was protected against the lawsuit from Randice-Lisa Altschuls Diece-Lisa Industries by the U.S. Constitutions First Amendment protections for freedom of speech. The Supreme Court most recently addressed the intersection of trademark law and free speech in its June 8 ruling for Jack Daniels in a dispute over a dog chew toy fashioned to resemble the companys distinctive whiskey bottles. The high court asked the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to reconsider Diece-Lisas case in light of that ruling. Representatives for the companies did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the decision. Altschul invented a stuffed animal in 1994 with sleeves that could simulate an animals hug, and her company Diece-Lisa Industries owns intellectual property rights for a wearable Lots of Hugs bear. Diece-Lisa sued Disney in 2012, saying Lots-o-Huggin Bear and Disneys toys based on the character closely resemble Lots of Hugs and infringed its trademark in the Lots of Hugs name. Lots-o-Huggin Bear, nicknamed Lotso, is an antagonist in Toy Story 3, which won the Academy Award for best animated feature film and drew more than a billion dollars at the box office worldwide. Los Angeles-based U.S. District Judge Terry Hatter ruled for Disney in 2021, citing First Amendment protections. The San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in 2022 affirmed Hatters decision. Altschuls company told the Supreme Court in October that Disney should not have been protected under a legal construct called the Rogers test that has allowed artists to lawfully use trademarks without permission when the use has artistic relevance to their work and would not explicitly mislead consumers. Diece-Lisa said the 9th Circuits ruling radically expanded the test beyond its original intent to protect culturally significant marks and titles of artistic works. The Supreme Court reined in the Rogers test earlier this month when it decided that the First Amendment did not protect a Bad Spaniels vinyl chew toy that parodies Jack Daniels branding. The case is Diece-Lisa Industries Inc v. Disney Store USA LLC, U.S. Supreme Court, No. 22-347.

Rajakumari, who died while in the custody of the Welikada Police, be submitted to the court. Accordingly, Colombo Additional Magistrate Harshana Kekunawala ordered that the relevant report be submitted to the court on 26 July. The postmortem report of the deceased was taken up before court today by the Additional Magistrate, during which a witness, namely Mahendran Suresh, testified that he had seen Rajakumari being assaulted by officers of the Welikada Police. He further revealed that two police officers had handcuffed him while he was at the Colombo Fort bus depot, and took him to a house located down Cotta Road in Borella, in which the deceased had been employed. Suresh claimed that both he and Rajakumari were handcuffed together, and at that point she was in good health. Subsequent to bringing them to the Welikada Police Station, however, Suresh revealed that two Police officers, whose appearances he described to the court, had assaulted both him and Rajakumari, despite her employers pleas to resolve the issue in a non-violent manner. The witness testimonial was recorded under the direction of the Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP) of the Criminal Investigation Department (CID), Meryl Ranjan Lamahewa. 41-year-old Rajakumari, a resident of Badulla, was arrested on 11 May based on a complaint made by her employer, famed producer Sudharma Nethicumara, claiming that she had stolen gold jewellery belonging to her. She had later died while in the custody of the Welikada Police, regarding which her relatives raised suspicions, claiming that she had been subjected to assault. Disciplinary action was then taken against seven police personnel attached to the Welikada Police, with a Sub-Inspector (SI), two Sergeants and a Constable being interdicted while a Constable and two Women Constables were subsequently transferred.",

        "date": "June 21, 2023 08:33 pm",
        "content": "The Sectoral Oversight Committee on Environment, Natural Resources and Sustainable Development has disclosed that 23 projects initiated by the Urban Development Authority (UDA) by spending government funds are currently stopped and that amongst such projects, 11 have been halted due to issues between the institutions. The Committee emphasized that in addition to the projects that have stopped due to lack of funds, the main reason for these projects to halt is that there is no good cooperation or agreement between the relevant institutions, the Parliamentary Communications Department reported. The Sectoral Oversight Committee on Environment, Natural Resources and Sustainable Development which met on Tuesday (June 20) under the Chairmanship of Ajith Mannapperuma, has taken into consideration the projects which have been initiated by the UDA, but have been abandoned due to various reasons thereby making a change in the strategies or existing rules followed in starting and maintaining the projects. Thus, it was revealed that an amount of Rs. 56,388 million has been estimated for 11 projects that have been stopped in the middle due to the problems between the institutions, and although the Urban Development Authority has spent Rs. 2,531 million, there are outstanding bills of Rs. 14,23 million for further payment. Also, it was revealed that an amount of Rs. 56,999 million is required for the completion of the projects, the Parliamentary Communications Department said. Since there are projects that have been stopped due to lack of funds as well as projects that have been stopped due to institutional issues that need to be resolved between various institutions, the committee focused its attention on projects that have been stopped in the middle due to problems between institutions at this Committee meeting held. The Ceylon Electricity Board, Road Development Authority, National Water Supply and Drainage Board, Sri Lanka Railway Department and the Prisons Department were called before the Committee, including the Urban Development Authority, it added. The 11 projects that have been stopped due to inter-institutional issues include the construction of the new access road from Kottawa to Mahenawatta, the development of Alavwa town (road widening), the construction of the entrance to Yakkala from the Gampaha highway, the expansion of Imaduwa town, the construction of low-income houses in Beruwanawatta, Eheliyagoda, Hatton. The committee has further considered the development of the railway station and the replacement of the Welikada prison. Work on the construction of the new access road from Kottawa to Mahenawatta is about 98 completed and that the problem of land acquisition has been largely resolved as another place has been proposed for the people who will lose their land and post resolving the remaining issues with the Homagama Divisional Secretary, the project can be given to the Road Development Authority for completion Officials of the Urban Development Authority said. It has been further disclosed that the construction of 34 low-income houses in Beruwanavatta, Eheliyagoda, planned to resettle people who will lose their land during the construction of the proposed by-pass instead of the pass through the city, which is very important for the development of Eheliyagoda, has been stopped due to problems in obtaining electricity and water supply for those houses. The Committee has instructed since the houses have been completed, to have the projects completed by resolving problems of providing facilities with the Electricity Board and the Ratnapura District Community Water Supply Department and to resolve ownership issues of the land existing between the Railway Department and the Road Development Authority through cooperation between the institutions. Furthermore, it was revealed before the Committee that although the land acquisition work of the proposed Gampaha, Makavita, Nelumwila Health Lane Project has been completed, the project has stopped midway. As Rs. 13 million has been spent for this purpose, the Committee instructed to carry out urban forestry on this piece of land and use it in the process of increasing forestry in Sri Lanka, the parliamentary communications department mentioned. Under the replacement of Welikada prison, the Prisons Department and the Urban Development Authority were instructed that the value of the land where Welikada is currently located should be accurately assessed by the Government Valuation Department, and the money obtained by leasing the existing land or calling for tenders and selling the land should be used to locate the prison on the proposed land in Horana with more space and facilities under approved measurements. The Committee emphasized that the cost can be covered through the investment received without spending government funds for the relevant project. The Committee also emphasized that by replacing the Welikada prison, the government hopes to use the more valuable Welikada land for other productive investment purposes and to re-establish the prison with more spacious facilities with the large amount of funds received. According to the facts considered, the Committee has emphasized that the main reason for the cease of the projects is the lack of good cooperation or agreement between the institutions involved. The recommendation of the Committee was that when starting projects under the limited resources available, a preliminary analysis should be done regarding the social, economic and environmental impacts and the most beneficial and most important method should be followed. The participating officials were also instructed to follow the instructions and guidance given by the Committee and inform the Committee within 03 weeks of the progress regarding the work of the considered projects. Committee Members Thushara Indunil Amarasena, Akila Ellawala, Waruna Liyanage, Dr. Thilak Rajapakshe, Upul Mahendra Rajapaksha were present at the Committee meeting held.",

        "content": "SriLankan Airlines has issued a clarification confirming that last nights (20 June) flight UL 470 to Seoul, which was to depart at 08.20 p.m., was delayed overnight and citing the reason for the delay. Unfortunately, one cockpit crew member who was scheduled for this flight was sick last night, and due to the various regulations for fatigue and safety that govern operating crew, there was no available replacement until the morning of 21 June 2023, the national carrier said in a statement. SriLankan Airlines said it regrets the inconvenience caused to its guests by the delay of UL 470. In such circumstances, the airline does everything possible to keep the passengers updated and provide hotel accommodation for those who need it, it said. The airline said it is also working with the Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment (SLBFE) and Korean authorities to rebook the passengers scheduled to travel to Seoul for work on the next earliest flight. As a matter of fact, SriLankans flight schedule to South Korea is primarily based on supporting the travel needs of migrant workers, and in that regard SriLankan has been collaborating closely with the Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment since April 2022. The statement further states: All airlines have delays from time to time. This is an industry which is highly regulated for safety reasons with strict rules governing flying hours, maintenance checks and under what conditions an aircraft may or may not fly. SriLankan Airlines monitors its on-time performance very closely. In the first quarter of 2023, SriLankan Airlines performance was fully in line with the major alliances, and the airlines record for long delays over the first five months of the year compares favourably with the average for airlines flying from Colombo.",

        "content": "The UNs deputy human rights chief on Wednesday urged the international community to use accepted principles of universal and extraterritorial jurisdiction to investigate and prosecute alleged perpetrators of human rights violation in Sri Lanka, as long as the accountability deficit remains in the island nation. She also called on them to support to the relevant accountability processes in third states as well as the fair application of targeted sanctions against credibly alleged perpetrators of rights violations in Sri Lanka. Presenting the oral update on Sri Lanka during the 53rd Regular Session of UN Human Rights Council, the UNs Deputy High Commissioner for Human Rights Nada Al-Nashif highlights some key developments and trends from the OHCHRs close monitoring of the situation in Sri Lanka ahead of the full written update that will be presented to the council at its 54th session. She stated that the economic crisis continues to have a severe impact on the rights and wellbeing of many Sri Lankans. Discussion with creditors are underway and although the International Monetary Fund (IMF) approved a financial support package, which is an important first step, it is crucial to ensure that the burden of potential reforms does not further compound inequalities. She stated that robust safety nets and social protection measures are needed to shelter the most vulnerable from the negative spillovers of economic restructuring. The Deputy High Commissioner said it is also vital to address the underlying factors of the crisis including corruption, which was a loud and essential demand of the protests that took place last year. The protest movement loudly expressed societys aspirations for better governance and an inclusive vision for and with Sri Lanka, she noted. Al-Nashif stated that 12 months on, the full potential for the historic transformation that would address long-standing challenges has yet to be realized in the island nation. Our office urges the government and political parties in Sri Lanka to use this opportunity for democratic renewal, for deeper institutional reforms and advance accountability and reconciliation as well as the promotion and the protection of human rights. This would be particularly appropriate in a year that marks the 75th anniversary of both Sri Lankas independence and the universal declaration of human rights, she pointed out. We encourage the dialogue that the President has initiated with Tamil political parties and welcome his promise to stop land acquisition for archeological, forestry or security purposes, an increasing source of local conflict an increasing source of local conflict and tension. She noted that plans for more inclusive memorialization and other forms of dealing with the past have been announced and that the Supreme Court has issued an important order for compensation to be paid to the victims of the 2019 Easter Sunday attacks. However, these intentions need to materialize into new laws, policies and practices that will make good on these promises and bring about tangible change, she emphasized. Similarly anticipated is the Constitutional Councils new appointments to the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka, an important test of the independence and effectiveness of this critical national institution, Al-Nashif said. She said the announcement of plans for a Truth Commission or similar reconciliation mechanisms requires attention. Sri Lanka has witnessed too many ad hoc commissions in the past, that failed to ensure accountability. The Office of Missing Persons has not achieved the results that provide satisfaction to victims. What is needed is a coherent plan that connects the different elements of truth, redress, memorialization, accountability and creates the right enabling environment for a successful and sustainable transitional justice process, the deputy UN rights chief said in the oral update. Accountability remains the fundamental gap in attempts to deal with the past and as long as impunity prevails, Sri Lanka will achieve neither genuine reconciliation nor sustainable peace, she warned. I am pleased to report that the project team established in our office to advance accountability has continued to make progress pursuant to Resolution 511. It is in the process of providing concreate support to several jurisdictions who have ongoing criminal justice investigations. It is conducting proactive investigations work on key cases and collecting, consolidating and analyzing information and evidence from a variety of UN and other sources, which is preserved in a repository source to be used for future accountability initiatives. She said victims remain at the heart of this work, including through our active engagement with victim organizations and civil society more broadly. Fundamentally it is and remains the responsibility of Sri Lankan authorities to directly acknowledge past violations and undertake credible investigations and prosecutions alongside other accountability measures, the Deputy High Commissioner said stressed. However, as long as this accountability deficit remains the international community can and should play complimentary roles, she said. Means to do so include use of accepted principles of universal and extra territorial jurisdiction to investigate and prosecute alleged perpetrators and support to the relevant accountability processes in third states as well as the fair application of targeted sanctions against credibly alleged perpetrators. The past months have unfortunately witnessed an old reflex of using draconian laws to curtail opposition and control civic space. With a heavy-handed approach to protests far too often including the arrest of protest leaders and forceful crowd control measures as well as the persistent use of the military in police functions. Recent arrests made over statements made during comedy performances and of Members of Parliament engaged in protests exemplify this concern, Al-Nashif said. In March of this year, the Human Rights Committee expressed deep concern about the misuse of the Covenant on Civil and Political Rights Act against journalists, human rights defenders and other civil society actors, she further said. The government has committed to replace the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA) with legislation that adheres to international standards, but the new Anti-Terrorism Bill that was gazetted in March contains sweeping provisions that will limit freedom of expression, peaceful assembly and even labour rights. Following strong pushback from civil society, the draft bill has now been recalled for additional consultations, she pointed out. The UNs Deputy High Commissioner for Human Rights encouraged the government to repeal the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA) and in the meantime to implement fully a strict moratorium on its use considering that the ordinary criminal code and other auxiliary laws already provide adequate tools for law enforcement. The office stands ready to provide support to the government and people of Sri Lanka in order to advance reconciliation and accountability and human rights for all, she said in conclusion.",

        "date": "June 22, 2023 09:53 am",
        "content": "A massive cooking gas explosion at a barbecue restaurant in northwestern China killed 31 people and injured seven, Chinese authorities said Thursday. The blast tore through the establishment at around 8:40 p.m. Wednesday on a busy street in Yinchuan, the capital of the traditionally Muslim Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, as people were gathering on the eve of the Dragon Boat Festival holiday, the official Xinhua News Agency said. The festival is a national holiday devoted to eating rice dumplings and racing boats manned by teams of paddlers. Chinese President Xi Jinping demanded all-out treatment of the injured and a safety overhaul after the explosion, Xinhua reported. Online news site The Paper cited a woman identified only by her surname Chen saying she had been about 50 meters (164 feet) from the restaurant when she heard the explosion. She described seeing two waiters emerge from the restaurant afterward, one of whom collapsed immediately, while thick smoke billowed from the restaurant and a strong smell of cooking gas permeated the area. The Central Governments Ministry of Emergency Management said on its social media account that search and rescue work at the restaurant was completed early Thursday morning and investigators were sent to determine the cause of the blast. Industrial accidents of this type are a regular occurrence in China, usually attributed to poor government supervision, corruption, cost-cutting measures by employers and little safety training for employees. At least nine people were killed in an explosion at a Chinese petrochemical plant, and three others died in a helicopter crash during the countrys May Day holiday. In February, 53 miners were killed in the collapse of a massive open pit coal mine in the northern region of Inner Mongolia, leading to numerous arrests, and four people were detained over a fire at an industrial trading company in central China in November that killed 38 people. The central government has pledged stronger safety measures since an explosion in 2015 at a chemical warehouse in the northern port city of Tianjin killed 173 people, most of them firefighters and police officers. In that case, a number of local officials were accused of having taken bribes to ignore safety violations. Source - The Associated Press -Agencies",

        "date": "June 22, 2023 10:16 am",
        "content": "A blast ripped through a street near Paris historic Latin Quarter on Wednesday and rescuers were searching for two missing people feared buried under the rubble of a building that partially collapsed in the explosion. The explosion tore through Rue Saint-Jacques, which runs from the Notre-Dame de Paris Cathedral to the Sorbonne University, in the late afternoon, injuring at least 37 people, four of whom were fighting for their lives in hospital. Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin said that sniffer dogs had picked up a scent under the mound of masonry left strewn across Rue Saint-Jacques. It is possible tonight that we will find bodies or perhaps survivors, Darmanin told reporters at the scene of the blast. The blast destroyed the facade of a building housing the Paris American Academy design school popular with foreign students. Witnesses described a deafening explosion and a giant fireball that rose several stories high. Soldiers helped secure a safety cordon around the scene. The Paris prosecutors office said it was too early to say what caused the blast. But the local deputy mayor, Edouard Civel, referred to a gas explosion in a Twitter post and witnesses told BFM TV there had been a strong smell of gas moments before the blast. The shop shook violently, it felt like bomb blast, said Rahman Oliur who manages a food shop a few doors down the street from the American Academy. Bar worker Khal Ilsey said he heard a huge explosion before running out and seeing a violent blaze at the end of the street. RUBBLE AND FIRE The blast occurred at 4:55 p.m. (1455 GMT), just as workers were heading home. The area is frequented by tourists and foreign students in the early summer but there was no immediate indication that any foreigners were among the victims. Several nearby building were evacuated. More than two hours after the explosion, first responders were still treating residents for shock. One woman fainted in the street. Paris Prosecutor Laure Beccuau said early indications were that the blast originated inside the collapsed building. Investigators would look into whether building conditions were in breach of regulations or if an individual had acted without due care, he added. More than 300 firefighters were involved in bringing the blazes under control. Rue Saint-Jacques runs through the Latin Quarter - famed as the home to many expatriate and French writers, musicians and artists over the years - to the Val de Grace military hospital and is a few blocks from the popular Jardin du Luxembourg. I was at home writing ... I thought it was a bomb, said art historian Monique Mosser, adding that many of the windows in her building had been blown out by the blasts shockwave. A neighbour knocked on the door and told me that the fire brigade were asking us to evacuate as quickly as possible. I grabbed my laptop, my phone. I didnt even think to take get my medication. In January 2019, a gas leak caused an explosion that killed 4 people and injured 66 in the 9th arrondissement. In April that year, a fire broke out in the Notre-Dame Cathedral, destroying much of the roof and causing other damage before it was extinguished. Source - Reuters -Agencies",

Accordingly, Additional Solicitor General Parinda Ranasinghe, on behalf of AG Sanjaya Rajaratnam, today assured the court that the former AG will not be arrested regarding a statement he had previously made on the 2019 attacks, when a petition filed by the former AG Livera was taken up before the court this morning (June 22). De Livera was summoned before the Terrorist Investigation Division (TID) on numerous occasions, in order to record a statement on his controversial statement pertaining to an alleged coup behind the Easter Sunday attacks. The former AG filed a petition on 24 April, highlighting that the police are not authorized to question his actions during his tenure as the AG, adding that such treatment violated his privileges as an Attorney General. Thus, he sought an order through the petition, preventing the TID from arresting and recording statements from him. On 18 May, then-Attorney General Dappula de Livera claimed that there had been a conspiracy behind the series of bomb attacks that took place on 21 April 2019, killing 269 persons and injuring over 500 others. Livera infamously handled the Easter Sunday inquiry right from the beginning while he served as the Solicitor General before being appointed as Attorney General on 29 April 2019, just eight days after the Easter Sunday attacks. He later retired on 25 May 2021, while acting AG Sanjaya Rajaratnam was appointed as his successor.",

Following her meeting with President Ranil Wickremesinghe, Georgieva assured that the IMF is committed to supporting the island nations economic reforms, in a bid to improve the living standards of Sri Lankans. I warmly welcomed the strong ownership by the Sri Lankan government to address current economic challenges. We are committed to support Sri Lankas economic reforms to improve living standards for its people, she said in a Twitter statement. President Wickremesinghe arrived in Paris on Wednesday (21 June), on the invitation of his French counterpart, Emmanuel Macron, to address the World Leaders Summit for a New Global Financing Pact on 22 - 23 June, which endeavours to garner cross-regional consensus among the international community to build a more inclusive, a more equitable international financial architecture with strong deliverables. Accordingly, Wickremesinghe will speak at the Summit on Sri Lankas experience as a middle-income country and the challenges faced in dealing with international financial institutes with a severe economic crisis. Sri Lankas experience is considered to be of particular relevance to the outcome of the Summit, especially in the context of the countrys recent success in debt discussions with the IMF and in progressing on the path to economic stability and recovery. The other leaders of the round table speaking under this particular theme are President of Tunisia Kaïs Saied, Prime Minister of Rwanda Edouard Ngirente, Managing Director of the IMF Kristalina Georgieva, President of the African Development Bank Dr. Akinwumi A.

        "content": "The Colombo Magistrates Court ordered today that a request will be forwarded to the President of the Court of Appeal to take action against State Minister Diana Gamage, over contempt of court. The order was issued by Colombo Chief Magistrate Prasanna Alwis today, upon consideration of the facts presented by the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) and the lawyers of social activist Oshala Herath, the petitioner in the relevant case. Herath filed a petition seeking a writ order disqualifying the state minister from holding a parliamentary seat alleging that issuing a diplomatic passport to the State Minister is against the Immigration and Emigration Act since she also holds British citizenship. On 24 April, the court set aside the petition seeking Gamages arrest. Accordingly, Colombo Chief Magistrate Prasanna Alwis declared that the court will not issue an order related to the arrest of the State Minister on the offences under the Immigration and Immigration Act, citing that the decision was arrived at since the CID is empowered by law to take the necessary steps regarding the arrest of the State Minister over the relevant offences. Presenting facts in this regard before the court today, the CID claimed that during an interview with TV Deranas 360 programme on 29 May, the State Minister had alleged that she had received the decision of the court in advance. Speaking in court, Colombo Chief Magistrate Prasanna Alwis noted that upon the examination of the facts presented by the relevant parties, it appears that the factors required to build a case of contempt of court are present within the said matter. Thus, the Magistrate noted that he will request the President of the Court of Appeal to initiate legal action against the State Minister under charges of contempt court. Magistrate Alwis also ordered the footage of the relevant interview to be submitted to the court, with other related documents.",
