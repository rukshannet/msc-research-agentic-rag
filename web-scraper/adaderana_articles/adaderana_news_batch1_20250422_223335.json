        "content": "Prime Minister Dr. Harini Amarasuriya stated in Parliament today (10) that the government is set to introduce a new examination to replace the Grade 5 Scholarship Examination by 2028, aimed at minimizing psychological stress on students. She stated that an expert committee will be appointed next year to review and reform the current scholarship examination process. The committee will focus on reducing the undue pressure placed on young students while ensuring that the exam remains a fair opportunity for academic advancement. Highlighting the root cause of the intense competition associated with the scholarship exam, the Prime Minister pointed out that disparities in school quality drive students to seek admission to reputed institutions. She emphasized that the governments long-term goal is to bridge these gaps and create a more equitable education system. The Grade 5 Scholarship Exam exists because of the inequalities between schools. It provides talented students with an opportunity to move to a school with better facilities. While we cannot eliminate these disparities overnight, we are working towards gradually reducing the gap between well-resourced and underprivileged schools. Until then, the scholarship exam will continue, but we are committed to minimizing the mental stress it imposes on students, she said.",

        "date": "March 11, 2025 06:38 am",
        "content": "Elon Musks X was hit by waves of outages earlier Monday, which the billionaire claims was due to a cyberattack with IP addresses originating in Ukraine. Were not sure exactly what happened, Musk said during a Fox Business interview Monday afternoon. But there was a massive cyberattack to try to bring down the X system, with IP addresses originating in the Ukraine area. Musk did not give any further details about the origin of the attack, including whether he believes it was connected to the Ukrainian government. It is possible to mask IP addresses and make it seem as though the traffic is coming from elsewhere, and spoofing locations is often offered by hackers-for-hire. According to outage tracking site DownDetector, the problems began around 6 a.m. ET when up to 20,538 users reported problems. The issues temporarily died down before nearly 40,000 users reported outages at 10 am. Outages reported on DownDetector began to drop around 2 p.m. ET and trailed off throughout the afternoon. Many users on DownDetector said the platform wouldnt load, and the outage appeared to be global, according to DownDetectors international sites. During the Fox Business interview, which aired during the 4 p.m. ET hour, Musk said platform was working again. DownDetector data is self-reported, meaning it doesnt fully represent the outages scale. CNN has reached out to X, though the company doesnt usually respond to press inquiries. Musk posted on X early Monday afternoon that he believed a large, coordinated group andor a country is involved, though the source of motivation behind the attack wasnt confirmed. Musk also replied Yes to a post on X suggesting people are trying to silence the billionaire and his platform, although no further details about the service disruption, including whether it was caused by a targeted attack, have been revealed. Eric Noonan, CEO of cybersecurity provider CyberSheath, told CNN that its likely too early to tell if an attack caused the issues. One of the things that should always be taken with a grain of salt is any statements made in the short period of time, immediately after, or even in this case during an attack, Noonan said. Musk has a history of attributing technical snafus to cyberattacks. When his conversation with Donald Trump on X started 42 minutes late in August 2024, he said there was a probability of an attack. Given the prominence of this conversation, there was of course a 100 probability of DDOS attacks, Musk posted on the social media platform at the time. DDOS stands for distributed denial-of-service, which involves overwhelming servers with fake traffic to cause service disruptions. But Florida Governor Ron Desantis presidential campaign announcement on X in 2023 was also marred by technical difficulties. Ransomware attacks have been more common than DDOS attacks in recent years because theyre usually financially motivated, according to Noonan. DDOS, however, is typically used to cause a disruption, which also makes confirming the source of these types of attacks more difficult. Musk implemented widespread cuts and major changes to X after acquiring the popular social media platform, then called Twitter, in 2022. He immediately laid off top executives and, within days of acquiring X, cut 3,500 people, or around half the platforms workforce. He laid off 80 of the staff in total and required the remaining employees to return-to-office full time. The platform has experienced a series of glitches and disruptions since the acquisition. Its been a tough day for the businesses owned by Musk, who is also the head of Trumps Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).

        "date": "March 11, 2025 07:10 am",
        "content": "Sri Lanka has been named one of the countries with the lowest terror threats in the world, according to the Global Terrorism Index (GTI) 2025. The 12th annual GTI report, released on Wednesday (March 5), ranked Sri Lanka 100th among 163 countries considered in the index. However, with a GTI score of zero, Sri Lanka shares the lowest spot on the index with 63 other countries. The report indicates that Sri Lanka has significantly improved, dropping 64 spots in the index within a year, thereby lowering the risk of terror threats within the island nation. Meanwhile, Sri Lanka also shares the lowest terror threat ranking in the South Asian region with Bhutan. In 2024, South Asia had the highest average GTI score, a position it has held for the past decade. Despite an overall deterioration in the regiondriven primarily by Pakistanterrorism has significantly declined compared to a decade ago, with all South Asian countries showing improvement. The report attributes this improvement largely to a decline in terrorist activity in Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Nepal, and Sri Lanka. The region is home to two of the ten countries with the worst GTI scores: Afghanistan and Pakistan. Of the seven countries in South Asia, only Bhutan and Sri Lanka have a GTI score of zero, indicating that neither country has recorded a terrorist attack in the past five years. The surge in terrorism in the region was primarily driven by Pakistan, where regional attacks increased from 726 to 1,399 and deaths rose from 961 to 1,303. Bangladesh and Pakistan were the only two countries in the region to record a deterioration in their scores in 2024. Consequently, Pakistan ranked as the second most terrorism-affected country globally for the second consecutive year, while India was ranked 14th. Sri Lanka was the most improved South Asian country in 2024, having recorded no terrorist attacks or deaths for the fifth consecutive year since 2019. Nepal followed as the second most improved country, recording no attacks or deaths for the second consecutive year. Meanwhile, the Sahel region remains the epicenter of terrorism, accounting for over half of all global terrorism-related deaths, according to the report. The GTI is produced by the international think tank, the Institute for Economics  Peace (IEP), and has been published annually for the past 12 years. It is the most comprehensive resource on global terrorism trends, using multiple factors to calculate scores, including the number of incidents, fatalities, injuries, and hostage situations. These factors are combined with conflict and socioeconomic data to provide a holistic picture of terrorism worldwide.",

        "date": "March 11, 2025 07:35 am",
        "content": "Doctors said Monday that Pope Francis is no longer in imminent danger of death as a result of pneumonia but have decided to keep him hospitalised for several more days to receive treatment. In a late update, the doctors said the 88-year-old pope remains stable and has consolidated improvements in recent days, as determined by blood tests and positive responses to drug treatments. However, in view of the complexity of the clinical picture and the important infectious picture presented on admission, it will be necessary to continue medical drug therapy in a hospital setting for additional days, according to the Vatican statement. Francis followed the Vaticans week-long spiritual retreat via video-conference on Monday as he continued his recovery from double pneumonia and looked ahead to the 12th anniversary of his election amid questions about what the future of his papacy might look like. As he did on Sunday, Francis participated in the retreat remotely from the Rome hospital where he is being treated. He could see and hear the Rev Roberto Pasolini, preacher of the papal household, but the priests, bishops and cardinals gathered for the retreat in the Vatican auditorium could not see or hear him. Pasolini is delivering a series of meditations this week on The hope of eternal life, a theme that was chosen well before Francis was admitted to Romes Gemelli hospital on Feb 14 with a complex lung infection. The retreat, which is an annual gathering that kicks off the Catholic Churchs solemn Lenten season leading to Easter, continues through the week. The Vatican has said Francis would participate in spiritual communion with the rest of the hierarchy, from afar. In its early update Monday, the Vatican said Francis was resuming his physical and respiratory therapy at the Gemelli hospital after a quiet night. Francis has been using a nasal tube for supplemental oxygen to help him breathe during the day and a noninvasive mechanical ventilation mask at night. The 88-year-old pope, who has chronic lung disease and had part of one lung removed as a young man, had what was just a bad case of bronchitis when he was hospitalized last month. The infection progressed into a complex respiratory tract infection and double pneumonia that has sidelined Francis for the longest period of his 12-year papacy and raised questions about the future.

The news arrives just one month after Doechii won the Grammy for best rap album, only the third woman to win in that category. When it came time to give her award speech, the tears were immediate. This category was introduced in 1989. Two women have won, Lauryn Hill  she said, correcting herself. Three women have won. Lauryn Hill, Cardi B and Doechii. Now she will be honored as Woman of the Year at the Billboard Women in Music Awards on March 29. Previous honorees include Madonna, Cardi B, Billie Eilish, Selena Gomez and Ariana Grande. In 2024, The Associated Press named Doechiis breakout mixtape, Alligator Bites Never Heal, one of the best albums of the year  a versatile album that teeters from the romance of her smooth RB and the acuity of her flows. Doechii is taking pop culture by storm, this year becoming the third woman in history to win a Grammy best rap album, and dazzling fans of every musical genre with her breathtaking performances, ultra-candid lyrics and utterly unique sound, style and spirit, said Hannah Karp, Editor-in-Chief of Billboard in a statement.

        "content": "Prime Minister Dr. Harini Amarasuriya stated that the 2025 budget of the present government has allocated the highest amount ever in the history for education and that the Ministry of Education has introduced a five-pillar plan for the proposed education reforms. The Prime Minister made these remarks in Parliament yesterday (10) during the budget debate on expenditure allocation for the Ministry of Education (MOE). Speaking in Parliament during the budget debate on expenditure allocation for the MOE, Dr. Amarasuriya paid tribute to the late Dr. Janaki Jayawardena, a respected academic and activist who played a crucial role in the 2011-2012 Federation of University Teachers Associations (FUTA) protest for increased education funding. Dr. Janaki Jayawardena was one of the key figures who led this movement. She led this movement silently, without seeking the spotlight. However, the struggle would not have been successful without her. she recalled. Additionally, the Prime Minister underscored the necessity of strategic reform, stating, Without properly reforms for education, the societal transformation we envision cannot be achieved. Only through education reform we can bring about the social, political, and economic transformations. The Prime Minister also discussed the largest-ever allocation for education in the nations history, amounting to LKR 619 billion, with a clear system in place to ensure effective utilization. She outlined key pillars of education reform, including curriculum modernization, teacher capacity building, infrastructure improvements, student assessment reforms, and societal engagement in education. Dr. Amarasuriya also highlighted the dire conditions in many higher education institutions, stating, This student community deserves to be treated with respect. She described the poor conditions in institutions across the country, noting that they only have one meal a day, and its only in the evening that they get to eat. To address these issues, LKR 36.841 billion has been allocated for higher education infrastructure. We need to ensure that we understand how they are living, how they are eating, and how they are learning, she said. Allocations have also been made for vocational education, with a focus on transforming it into a modern, relevant field that aligns with todays labor market needs. Full Speech by PM Dr. Harini Amarasuriya in Parliament on the budget debate for MOE: Today, we are presented by fourteen members who entered Parliament through the university system. However, I would like to take a moment in remembering a close colleague of ours, Dr. Janaki Jayawardena, who tragically passed away in a road accident just a few days ago. While my primary reason for mentioning Dr. Jayawardena at the beginning of this speech is to express my deepest condolences, I would take this moment to appreciate her exemplary figure as a model of dedication, integrity, and service that we can all look up to as Janaki embodied that ideal. Her students had immense love and respect for her. Beyond that, she was an exceptional colleague who worked dearly and inspired us greatly. Losing such university academics is a significant loss to the nation. That is why the speech is started in the memory of her. The protest led by the Federation of University Teachers Associations during 2011-2012 marked a significance turning point. It was able to build the confident that the leadership can be initiated in societal movement beyond addressing the professional demands. The protest which was held during 2011-2012 was not solely a protest held by the trade unions but it also concerned on addressing education. This protest was collectively supported by both the trade unions and the community who felt deep empathy towards the cause of education and it brought together other trade unions, teachers unions, civil society, and the concerned citizens and who resonated out a valuable message that together we can advocate and protest for achieving a common cause. Dr. Janaki Jayawardena was one of the key figures who led this movement. She led this movement silently, without seeking the spotlight. However, the struggle would not have been successful without her. You may recall that the five-day march from Galle to Colombo was launched during this movement. University academics participated in wearing black and orange T-shirts marked with 6. We did not even have enough funds to print these T-shirts. Dr. Janaki Jayawardena sold a piece of her land to find funds for that purpose. That was the kind of person she was, someone who is willing to sacrifice anything for what she believed in, someone who was unafraid to lead. Her absence is deeply felt at a time like this. We need such leads. What the universities and the society is needed at time like this is an exceptional role who see beyond their professional identities, who take responsibility for their students, their field, and their community, and who provide leadership and commitment. Her absence greatly grieved us and I extend my deepest condolence to her family, students, colleagues, and the many friends who stood by her. The primary reason for mentioning Dr. Jayawardena at the beginning of this speech was not to grieve by her absence but to commemorate her exemplary figure as a model of dedication. The highest amount ever allocated for education in the history has been set out in this years budget by the present government. A total of LKR 619 billion has been allocated for the next eight months of period with the allocation of LKR 21 billion specifically designated for capital expenditure and it marks the highest amount allocated for educational infrastructure in recent history. A clear system for utilizing these funds is also presented. Without properly reforms for education, the societal transformation we envision cannot be achieved. Only through education reform we can bring about the social, political, and economic transformations. Therefore, the 2025 budget has been presented with careful consideration along with a strategic planning for education reforms. The education reforms are expected to be achieved through five key pillars by the Ministry of Education. The first pillar is centered on the modernization of curriculum. It is expected to intrude a new curriculum that involves updating the existing curricula and designing an education system that nurtures the human resources that are needed for social transformation, and LKR 250 million has been allocated for this purpose. Further, an additional LKR 160 million has been allocated for related projects. Educational reforms have been discussed in the past, but despite various efforts, they have not been effectively implemented for years. The primary reason addresses that the changes to curriculum alone is not enough. That is why we have identified five key pillars in our education reforms. The curriculum is just one of them, and apart from that the implementation of necessary human resources for the educational reforms has been also focused on the 2025 budget. It is focused on improving the capacity of teachers, principals, educationists, and education administrators and it is addressed by the second pillar. The budget has allocated an amount of LKR 1.64 billion which is the highest amount ever allocated in the history to develop the capacity and I am pleased that we have been able to do so. The teachers are usually appointed to surpass the cadre of the teachers who are currently occupied in the teaching service or related fields, along with a special focus was drawn to the training teachers in training colleges and universities. In reality, the current state of our national colleges of education is extremely concerning. I recently visited the colleges of education in Polonnaruwa and Jaffna. The students, who are expected to become teachers in the future, have no proper facilities. They lack proper accommodation, water, and even basic necessities. While we discuss smart classrooms in schools, the teachers who are supposed to conduct those lessons are learning on blackboards in underprivileged conditions. They lack electricity and essential infrastructure. That is why special attention was drawn on this matter. For years, infrastructure projects have been implemented in schools. Since 2016, under the Nearest School is the Best School program initiated by the previous government, many initiatives have been undertaken. However, even today, some of the unfinished and unsafe buildings are located in schools. Many schools have impressive gates, fences, and signboards, but once you went inside, the students do not have proper facilities. Some of the schools are not processed by clean drinking water including basic sanitation facilities. Therefore, an amount of LKR 11,000 billion has been allocated to complete these unfinished school projects, with a special focus on sanitation facilities. Starting this year, we are committed to ensuring that no Sri Lankan child has to attend a school without proper sanitation facilities. We have also allocated LKR 11.126 billion through the line ministry and LKR 14.896 billion through provincial councils to address these issues in estate schools. It is addressed by the third pillar. The fourth pillar is ensuring that students are receiving education as well as undergoing proper assessment. The responsibility for assessment lies with the Department of Examinations, which has faced significant challenges over the years. When I first entered Parliament, I inquired about the capital expenditure allocated to the Department of Examinations. It was significantly low. This year, we have allocated LKR 12.36 billion to strengthen the evaluation process and enhance capacity within the Department of Examinations. The greatest challenge faced by the education system is the mental pressure that put on children due to the exam-centered approach. In order to overcome this, we must strengthen the institutions that are primarily responsible for evaluation. According to the fifth pillar, education cannot be solely restricted to the responsibility of the Ministry, the children, the teachers, or the schools alone. It should be a transformation within society as a whole. A social discussion is essential in order to make this a reality. It is during times like this that I remember Dr. Janaki Jayawardena. Social activists are needed in establishing this discussion and the discussion has been already included in the roadmap of the government. Further, funds have been allocated specifically for the well-being of children. Specifically I would like to remark on the higher education. We have established a top priority on the quality of higher education. Simply establishing universities is not enough; creating a university is not just about establishing a board. We have numerous examples of universities, faculties, and programs that were initiated primarily due to political reasons, with little regard on the quality of education. Moreover, the benefits for students or the impact on their education was never addressed. That is why we are giving special attention to improving the quality of higher education. Similarly, the well-being of students is also a priority. Many young people have lost confidence in their education and future. This student community deserves to be treated with respect. While the student population has grown, yet the facilities they deserved have never been addressed. I was in Ampara yesterday and visited a local institution. I was truly shocked. This institution, which has made a significant contribution to the field of higher education since 1955, had students living under deplorable conditions. There are wires used as fences, no proper roofs, no lights, and rats everywhere. I was astonished when I saw the conditions under which these children are expected to cook and eat. They only have one meal a day, and its only in the evening that they get to eat. There is a farming facility, but I only saw two workers there. This is the institution that was established to develop human resources for the agricultural sector in South Asia in 1955. Yet, none of this has been addressed. Similarly, I visited the German Tech institution in Kilinochchi, where there are no hostels for the students. They use makeshift offices with toilets as classrooms. Without these basic facilities, how can students feel any sense of education, dignity, or pride? We have allocated LKR 36.841 million for higher education infrastructure. We are requesting all higher education institutions to prioritize providing the necessary facilities for students. We need to ensure that we understand how they are living, how they are eating, and how they are learning. Allocations have been made for vocational education. We aim to transform vocational education into a modern, relevant field that aligns with the needs of todays world. This will help us create a skilled workforce that meets the demands of the future labor market. By doing so, we will develop and create educational fields that provide value and skills for young people, offering them real career paths. We urge everyone to look into this issue without any party or division. This is a crucial sector that needs to be addressed for the future of our country. Through this, we can shape our nation and our children to be fit for the world. It is not just about shaping minds, but about creating individuals with humanity, a refined and complete society. To achieve this, we must transform our education system. It must be achieved through the participation of humans. This transformation is something we are committed to bringing forward.",

        "date": "March 11, 2025 09:54 am",
        "content": "A 20-year-old woman is dead and a man is badly injured after a double shooting inside a Markham home that police say was targeted and shot at multiple times in the past year. The shooting happened around 6:30 a.m. Friday at a residence on Solace Road near Highway 48 and Castlemore Avenue, York Regional Police say. Officers who responded to the shooting found the two adults with gunshot wounds, according to Const. Kevin Nebrija. The female victim has been identified as 20-year-old Nilakshi Raguthas. Police say she was taken to a trauma centre and pronounced dead a short time after. The other victim, a 26-year-old man, was taken to hospital with serious but non-life threatening injuries, Nebrija said. A German Shepherd dog was also fatally shot during the attack, Nebrija said. Police say two suspects were seen speeding away from the home in a newer-model, black, four-door Acura TLX sedan. This is being investigated as a targeted shooting. And we can confirm that this house has been targeted multiple times in the past, Nebrija told reporters at the scene. Police were previously sent to the home five times since 2018, including three calls last year, he added. Several of those incidents involved suspects shooting at the residence from a distance, Nebrija said. The house was shot at once in February 2024 and twice the next month. Shortly after that, police held a town hall meeting with residents, Nebrija said. No arrests have been made in those previous cases. The homicide unit has taken over the investigation but it is too early to speculate on a possible motive for the slaying, he added. Police say the case marks York Regions third homicide of the year. They are appealing for anyone with information or security camera video that could assist investigators to contact York police or leave an anonymous tip with Crime Stoppers.

        "date": "March 11, 2025 10:16 am",
        "content": "Former Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte was served an Interpol arrest warrant from the International Criminal Court on his arrival at Manilas main airport on Tuesday, the government said. The ICC has said it would pursue an investigation of suspected crimes against humanity related to Dutertes role in overseeing a bloody war on drugs that killed thousands of Filipinos. Duterte had said on Monday in Hong Kong that he was ready to be arrested if the ICC issued a warrant and has repeatedly defended the anti-drugs crackdown. He has denied ordering police to kill drug suspects unless in self-defence. The office of President Ferdinand Marcos Jr said it received an official copy of the warrant, which was served on Duterte by police. Duterte was now in custody, it said in a statement. Dutertes former legal counsel Salvador Panelo said the arrest was unlawful, and said the police did not allow one of his lawyers to meet Duterte at the airport. The firebrand Duterte unilaterally withdrew the Philippines from the ICCs founding treaty in 2019 when it started looking into allegations of systematic extrajudicial killings, and the Philippines had until last year refused to cooperate with the ICC investigation. The war on drugs was the signature campaign policy that swept Duterte to power in 2016 as a maverick, crime-busting mayor, who delivered on promises he made during vitriolic speeches to kill thousands of narcotics dealers. According to police, 6,200 suspects were killed during anti-drug operations that they say ended in shootouts. But activists say the real toll of the crackdown was far greater, with thousands of slumland drug users, many of whom were included on official watch lists, killed in mysterious circumstances. Police deny involvement in those killings and reject allegations from rights groups of systematic executions and cover-ups. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

Changes to the design and modification of vehicles can be made with the prior approval of the Commissioner General of Motor Traffic, in accordance with the orders issued under the provisions of the Motor Traffic Act. Accordingly, the Motor Traffic (Construction of Vehicles) Regulations, 1983 have been amended from time to time, and regulations regarding how vehicles can be modified have been published through Gazette Notifications.

        "date": "March 11, 2025 11:56 am",
        "content": "President Anura Kumara Dissanayake has stated that eleven Japanese projects and seventy-six Chinese projects, which provide economic benefits to Sri Lanka but were previously stalled, have now recommenced, according to the Presidents Media Division (PMD). He also said that the government is committed to providing the necessary support to secure a share for Sri Lankan entrepreneurs in the global market. He highlighted that the government has a strong strategic plan to facilitate access to international markets by integrating diplomats and entrepreneurs into a unified process. The President made these remarks while attending the 26th Anniversary of the Chamber of Young Lankan Entrepreneurs (COYLE), held yesterday (10) at the Shangri-La Hotel in Colombo, the PMD stated. President Anura Kumara Dissanayake further stated that this years budget has been designed to create a more dynamic and flexible economy, replacing the stagnant economic conditions of the past. He noted that allowing greater economic mobility would enable the country to achieve a certain level of development. Accordingly, the budget has been structured in a way that does not cause major economic shocks. The President also emphasized that the current government remains sensitive to economic decision-making, ensuring that policies do not place an unbearable burden on the Sri Lankan Rupee. He acknowledged that certain decisions had to be made in alignment with recommendations from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), according to the PMD. President Anura Kumara Dissanayake revealed that the current government has taken the necessary and correct decisions to restore confidence in an economy where trust had previously collapsed. As a result, the country, which was officially declared bankrupt, has now been able to overcome its state of bankruptcy. The President further emphasized that his government ensures every rupee spent is treated as a public trust and utilized with the highest level of responsibility. Due to the governments economic policies, efforts have been made to restart 11 economically significant projects that were previously halted by the Japanese government, as well as 76 projects that had been suspended by the Chinese government. The current government has already taken significant steps to provide economic stability, creating a more secure environment for investors. As a result, the government has been able to facilitate large-scale investments in renewable energy, including the construction of a 50-megawatt wind power plant in Mannar. The President also highlighted that a business-friendly environment has been established where investors can operate without having to pay any commissions, the statement said. Furthermore, he stated that the government is prepared to empower young entrepreneurs, not only within Sri Lanka but also by providing them with the strength to expand into international markets. We have built the strongest and most politically stable administration in Sri Lanka, President Dissanayake stated. He pointed out that, in past parliaments, it was common for MPs representing the opposition to later join the government and vice versa. However, he emphasized that such a situation does not exist in the current parliament, where there is a clear distinction between the government and the opposition. He described this as a strong example of political stability. President Dissanayake also remarked that a model political system has now been established in Sri Lanka. He assured that, by the end of the current administrations tenure, there would be no room for a destructive political climate to re-emerge. The event was attended by government ministers, state officials, diplomats, and a group of young entrepreneurs, it added. --PMD--",

        "date": "March 11, 2025 03:29 pm",
        "content": "An open warrant has been issued against former Inspector General of Police (IGP) Deshabandu Tennakoon by the Matara Magistrates Court, upon the request of the Criminal Investigation Department (CID), said Ada Derana reporter. The CID informed the Matara Magistrates Court today that a total of ten suspicious locations across the island had been inspected, and intelligence officers had been deployed to eighteen other locations in an effort to arrest the former IGP. On March 10, former IGP Deshabandu Tennakoon filed a writ petition with the Court of Appeal, seeking an order to prevent his arrest. The petition, filed through his legal representatives, requested that an interim injunction be issued to stay the arrest warrant issued against him by the Matara Magistrates Court. Previously, the Matara Magistrates Court had issued the warrant in connection with a shooting incident that occurred in front of the W15 Hotel in the Pelena area of Weligama, Matara, on December 31, 2023. On March 6, Sri Lanka Police announced that former IGP Deshabandu Tennakoon cannot be located and is evading arrest. Sri Lanka Police had urged the public to report any information regarding his whereabouts to the Criminal Investigation Department (CID). Furthermore, the Police Spokesman emphasized that anyone assisting the former IGP in evading arrest, despite the pending warrant, will face legal action under Article 209 of the Penal Code. The incident in question dates back to December 31, 2023, when a team from the Colombo Crimes Division (CCD) traveled to Weligama in Matara with the intention of arresting individuals associated with the notorious underworld figure, Nadun Chinthaka Wickremeratne, alias Harak Kata. According to police, the CCD officers, who were in civilian attire, were attacked from inside the W15 Hotel, prompting them to return fire. A mobile patrol vehicle from the Weligama Police Station arrived at the scene and opened fire on the CCD officers van due to a misunderstanding, as the Weligama Police mistakenly believed the van was transporting criminals. As a result, the van fled the scene, but two CCD officers inside sustained gunshot wounds. One of the injured officers, 47-year-old Police Sergeant Upul Chaminda Kumara of the CCD, later succumbed to his injuries while receiving medical treatment. A preliminary inquest into the incident was conducted at the Matara Chief Magistrates Court, and the verdict was announced on March 27. Following this, the CID was instructed to arrest and produce eight individuals, including former Acting IGP Deshabandu Tennakoon, before the court.",

        "date": "March 11, 2025 05:31 pm",
        "content": "Armed militants are holding hundreds of train passengers hostage in an ongoing siege claimed by a separatist group behind rising violence in southwestern Pakistan. The militants wounded the driver as they took control of the train in a remote, mountainous area of Balochistan province which borders Afghanistan and Iran. Over 450 passengers onboard are being held hostage by gunmen, Muhammad Kashif, a senior railway government official in Quetta, the capital of the province, told AFP. Passengers include women and children, he added. The attack was immediately claimed by the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) which is fighting for independence and accuses outsiders of profiting from the regions wealth. In a statement, it said gunmen bombed the railway track before storming aboard the train. The militants swiftly took control of the train and have taken all passengers hostage, said the statement released to media. The group warned of severe consequences if an attempt is made to rescue the hostages. The incident happened around 1pm local time (8am Irish time) in rural Sibi district, near to a city station where it had been due to stop. A passenger train called the Jaffar Express was stopped by armed militants, said a senior government official in Sibi, who asked not to be named because he was not authorised to speak to the media. The passengers are being held hostage, and the driver has been injured. The train had left Quetta for Peshawar, in northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa - a more than 30-hour journey - at around 9am. An emergency has been imposed at hospitals in Sibi, according to the government official. A senior police official from the area bordering Sibi, who asked not to be named because he was not authorised to speak to the media, said that the train remains stuck just before a tunnel surrounded by mountains. The area is a mountainous region making it easier for militants to have hideouts and plan attacks. Security forces have been battling a decades-long insurgency in impoverished Balochistan, which militant groups claim is being exploited by outsiders, with wealth from its natural resources syphoned off with little benefit to the local population. Violence has soared in the western border regions with Afghanistan, from north to south, since the Taliban took back power in 2021. More than 1,600 people were killed in attacks in Pakistan in 2024 - the deadliest year in almost a decade - according to the Center for Research and Security Studies, an Islamabad-based analysis group. BLA militants killed seven Punjabi travellers in February after they were ordered off a bus. At least 39 people were killed in coordinated attacks last year that largely targeted ethnic Punjabis. In November, the BLA claimed responsibility for a bombing at Quettas main railway station that killed 26 people, including 14 soldiers. Source: AFP --Agencies",

Furthermore, the Prime Ministers Office has issued the following public advisory in this regard: We urge citizens to exercise extreme caution when encountering online advertisements promoting cryptocurrency investments, particularly those falsely claiming endorsements from government officials and public figures.

Irans Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said on Saturday that Tehran would not be bullied into negotiations, a day after Trump said he had sent a letter urging Iran to engage in talks on a new nuclear deal. While expressing openness to a deal with Tehran, Trump has reinstated the maximum pressure campaign he applied in his first term as president to isolate Iran from the global economy and drive its oil exports down towards zero. In an interview with Fox Business, Trump said last week, There are two ways Iran can be handled: militarily, or you make a deal to prevent Tehran from acquiring nuclear weapons. Iran has long denied wanting to develop a nuclear weapon. However, it is dramatically accelerating enrichment of uranium to up to 60 purity, close to the roughly 90 weapons-grade level, the IAEA has warned. Iran has accelerated its nuclear work since 2019, a year after then-President Trump ditched Tehrans 2015 nuclear pact with six world powers and reimposed sanctions that have crippled the countrys economy.

The token strike, is scheduled to begin at 8.00 a.m., and will continue for 24 hours until 8.00 a.m. tomorrow (13). However, the GMOA has assured that emergency treatment services will remain unaffected. The association further stated that the strike will not be implemented at childrens hospitals, maternity hospitals, kidney treatment units, the National Institute of Mental Health, or Tri-Forces hospitals, ensuring that critical healthcare services continue uninterrupted. Doctors and staff at the Anuradhapura Teaching Hospital commenced a strike last morning (11) demanding the immediate arrest of the individual who allegedly sexually assaulted a female doctor at the hospitals dormitory for medical officers last night (10). According to Ada Derana reporter, the victim, a 32-year-old female doctor, had returned to her quarters after completing her duties that evening. Between 6:30 p.m. and 7:00 p.m., an unidentified assailant allegedly entered the premises, threatened her with a knife, and sexually assaulted her. The GMOA had previously called on the government to take immediate steps to apprehend the suspect responsible before 8.00 a.m. today (12) and warned of trade union action if authorities failed to do so. Meanwhile, the Ministry of Health has released a statement concerning the alleged sexual assault on a female doctor of the Anuradhapura Teaching Hospital. The statement further mentions that the Ministry has been informed that police investigations are currently underway, with several police teams being deployed to arrest the suspect. Meanwhile, a group of officials, led by the Director of Medical Services, has already been dispatched to the Anuradhapura Teaching Hospital to look into the matter, it said.",

        "date": "March 12, 2025 09:47 am",
        "content": "Armed militants in Pakistans Balochistan region have attacked a train carrying more than 400 passengers and taken a number of them hostage, military sources told the BBC on Tuesday. The Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) fired at the Jaffar Express Train as it travelled from Quetta to Peshawar. The separatist group said it had bombed the track before storming the train in the remote Sibi district, claiming the train was under its control. At least 16 militants have been killed and 104 passengers rescued as of Wednesday morning, local media reported. Among those rescued are 17 injured passengers, who have been hospitalised for treatment. The militants had threatened to kill hostages if authorities did not release Baloch political prisoners within 48 hours, according to local reports. The rescue operation is ongoing. There were reports of intense firing at the train, a Balochistan government spokesman told local newspaper Dawn on Tuesday. A senior police official said it remains stuck just before a tunnel surrounded by mountains, AFP news agency reports. A senior army official confirmed to the BBC that there were more than 100 army personnel travelling from Quetta on the train. The Pakistani authorities - as well as several Western countries, including the UK and US - have designated the BLA as a terrorist organisation. It has waged a decades-long insurgency to gain independence and has launched numerous deadly attacks, often targeting police stations, railway lines and highways. On Tuesday, the group warned of severe consequences if an attempt was made to rescue those it is holding. I cant find the words to describe how we managed to escape. It was terrifying, Muhammad Bilal, one of the freed hostages, told AFP news agency. Allahditta, another passenger, said he was allowed to go because of his heart condition. The 49-year-old recalled how people began hiding under the seats in panic when the attackers stormed the train. A local railway official in Quetta earlier told the BBC that a group of 80 passengers - 11 children, 26 women and 43 men - had managed to disembark the train and walk to the nearest railway station, Panir. The official said the group was made up of locals from the province of Balochistan. One man, whose brother-in-law was still being held on the train, described an agonising wait. He said he had tried to drive to the area, but many of the roads were closed. Meanwhile, anxious families of passengers were trying to get information about their loved ones from the counter at Quetta railway station. The son of one passenger, Muhammad Ashraf, who left Quetta for Lahore on Tuesday morning, told BBC Urdu he had not been able to contact his father. Another relative said he was frantic with worry about his cousin and her small child, who were travelling from Quetta to Multan to pick up a family member. No one is telling me whats happening or if theyre safe, Imran Khan told Reuters news agency. Officials say they are yet to communicate with anyone on the train. The area has no internet and mobile network coverage, officials told the BBC. Balochistan is Pakistans largest province and the richest in terms of natural resources, but it is the least developed.

        "content": "More details have emerged regarding the suspect, who was arrested this morning in connection with the sexual assault of a female doctor at the doctors quarters of the Anuradhapura Teaching Hospital on Monday night (10). The suspect has been identified as a 34-year-old resident of the Galnewa area, the police said. Meanwhile, reports indicate that the arrested suspect, who had been remanded in custody in connection with a separate case, had only been released on Monday (10), the day on which the incident in question had occurred. It has also been revealed that he has previously lived as a layperson wearing monastic robes and had also absconded from military service. Following the incident, the suspect had fled the scene, taking one of the female doctors two mobile phones with him. Police had launched a search operation based on signals from the remaining phone. However, due to weak signals near the Awukana railway station, police had intensified their search in the surrounding area. A special team from the Galnewa Police ultimately tracked down and arrested the suspect while he was hiding in the Elabadugama area of Galnewa.

        "title": "All but one of worlds top 20 most polluted cities are in Asia, new study shows",
        "date": "March 12, 2025 11:25 am",
        "content": "All but one of the worlds top 20 most polluted cities last year were in Asia, a new study shows. The majority of these cities  13  are in the worlds most populous country, India, where booming economic growth is fired largely by coal and where hundreds of millions live in traffic-clogged and congested megacities. Another four are in neighboring Pakistan, with one in China and Kazakhstan respectively. The only city outside of Asia featured on the list is NDjamena, the capital of Chad in central Africa  which was named the country with the worst air pollution. Meanwhile the cities with the worst pollution in North America were all in California. The report by IQAir, a Swiss company that tracks global air quality, looked specifically at fine particulate matter, or PM2.5, one of the smallest but most dangerous pollutants. PM2.5 comes from sources like the combustion of fossil fuels, dust storms and wildfires. It is so tiny  120th of a width of a human hair  that it can travel past your bodys usual defenses into your lungs or bloodstream. The particles cause irritation and inflammation and have been linked to respiratory problems and chronic kidney disease. Exposure can cause cancer, stroke or heart attacks and has been associated with a higher risk of depression and anxiety. The World Health Organization (WHO) says average annual levels of PM2.5 should not exceed 5 micrograms per cubic meter. Byrnihat, an industrial town in northeast India recorded a PM2.5 concentration of 128.2 last year  more than 25 times the WHOs standard. It feels very sad and helpless that Byrnihat keeps topping the list , Suman Momin, 26, who lives in the city of around 70,000, told CNN. She blamed factories around the town and a booming construction industry and trees being felled as contributing to the toxic air. The pollution is particularly bad right now, visibility is not great, there is dust everywhere, my eyes also burn, she said. I do not leave home without a mask. Twelve other cities in the top 20 are in India. Its capital New Delhi featured as the worlds most polluted capital for the sixth consecutive year, with a PM2.5 concentration of 91.8. The report also listed six satellite cities  Faridabad, Loni, Delhi, Gurugram, Noida and Greater Noida  making the list. Just last November, a throat-searing blanket of smog settled over Delhi, disrupting flights, blocking buildings from view and prompting the citys chief minister to declare a medical emergency. But overall, India  the worlds most populous nation with 1.4 billion people dropped from third to fifth place from the previous year, according to the report. But the report said air pollution remains a significant health burden reducing life expectancy by an estimated 5.2 years. Indias neighbors Bangladesh and Pakistan  together home to some 400 million people  were second and third-most polluted countries globally in terms of PM2.5 molecules, according to the report. China  which used to dominate global rankings of the worlds worst air  noted a small improvement, the report said. Its national annual average PM2.5 concentration decreased from 32.5 micrograms per cubic meter to 31, with air quality improving in megacities like Beijing, Shanghai, Chengdu, Guangzhou and Shenzhen, the report said. China is the worlds largest carbon dioxide emitter but in recent years has waged a campaign against air pollution, particularly in the cities that have fuelled its economic growth, and has pushed a massive expansion in solar and wind power. But last month two clean-energy groups raised alarm over what they said were plans by Chinas power industry to build nearly 100 gigawatts of new coal plant capacity last year, the most in nearly a decade. All 20 of the worlds most polluted cities last year exceeded WHO PM2.5 guidelines by over 10 times, the IQ Air report showed. Data gaps Air pollution remains a critical threat to both human health and environmental stability, yet vast populations remain unaware of their exposure levels, said Frank Hammes, Global CEO of IQAir. Iran and Afghanistan did not feature in this years report due to a lack of data availability. Air quality monitoring in Southeast Asia is also a problem, with nearly all countries having significant gaps in government-led initiatives, the report found. In 2024, 173 out of 392 cities in the region lacked government monitoring stations, while Cambodia had none, it said. Those problems are likely to be exacerbated after the US announced earlier this month that it would stop sharing air quality data gathered from its embassies and consulates worldwide due to funding constraints the Associated Press reported. Air quality data saves lives, said Hammes. It creates much needed awareness, informs policy decisions, guiding public health interventions, and empowers communities to take action to reduce air pollution and protect future generations. Worst cities in North America Only 17 of 8,954 cities analyzed globally by IQAir recorded air quality which met WHO pollution guidelines, the report said. The cities with the worst air pollution in North America were Ontario, Bloomington and Huntington Park  all in California, the report said. Overall the United States saw a significant reduction in PM2.5 levels last year, with the annual average dropping 22 from 2023. Northern America has long boasted vigorous air quality monitoring systems, contributing 56 of the total number of ground-based air quality monitoring stations included in the IQ Air report  helping scientists with their continued research on air quality and aiding policymakers to make decisions about public health. Only 12 countries, regions, and territories recorded PM2.5 concentrations below the WHO guidelines, most of which were in the Latin America and Caribbean or Oceania region. The report called on governments to dedicate funding for renewable energy projects and strengthen emission limits for vehicles and industrial activities. Advice Suman wishes authorities in Byrnihat would take to save her city from appearing at the top of the most polluted list again next year. People around have developed breathing issues over the years as well, she told CNN. This is my birthplace. I am a local. I do not want to leave this area. We want the governments to do more, come together and work for us. Source: CNN --Agencies",

Accordingly, the officials who were present were sent back with instructions to appear on a future date, after being duly informed and adequately prepared. This occurred during a meeting of the Committee on Public Accounts (COPA) held recently at the Parliament under the Chairmanship of Member of Parliament Aravinda Senarath. The purpose of the meeting was to discuss the Auditor Generals reports for the years 2020, 2021, 2022, and 2023, as well as the departments current performance, the Parliamentary Communications Department said in a statement. During the meeting, the committee inquired into the implementation of directives issued during previous meetings. In particular, the Auditor General had presented 25 observations regarding illegal vehicle registrations that had taken place prior to the integration with the Customs computer system. The Committee expected a report detailing the investigations conducted on these matters and the disciplinary actions taken against the responsible officials. However, the Auditor General pointed out that such a report had not been submitted, the statement added. It further stated that although the officials present claimed that a report had been provided, the Auditor General stated that he had not received it. A copy of the purported report was tabled during the session, but upon examination, the Auditor General informed the Committee that it was entirely unsatisfactory. As a result, the Committee conducted an extensive inquiry into the matter, but the officials failed to provide satisfactory responses. They stated that they did not possess the relevant information dating back.

        "date": "March 12, 2025 06:13 pm",
        "content": "Pakistans military have been engaged in a deadly standoff for more than 24 hours with armed militants who hijacked a train and took hostages, in a dramatic escalation of an insurgency that has plagued the region for decades. The Baloch Liberation Army (BLA), a militant separatist group active in the restive and mineral-rich southwestern Balochistan province, claimed responsibility for the attack. Around 450 passengers were on the Jaffer Express enroute from Balochistans capital Quetta to Peshawar in the north, when militants opened intense gunfire as the train traveled through a tunnel early in its journey, according to officials. Pakistans military launched an operation to confront the attackers who used women and children as shields, according to security sources not authorized to speak to CNN. By Wednesday afternoon, 190 hostages had been rescued and 30 militants killed, according to the security sources, with video showing elderly women, men and children looking pale, frightened  but relieved  as they reunited with their families. Its unclear how many people are still being held. One rescued woman described scenes of chaos following the attack, likening it to the Day of Judgement. She told CNN she fled gunfire and walked for two hours to reach safety. Passenger Mohammad Ashraf told CNN he saw more than 100 armed individuals on the train and that no harm was inflicted on women and children. At least 10 civilians and members of Pakistans security forces had been killed, according to government and railway officials. The security sources accused the militants of being in contact with handlers in Afghanistan. Pakistans military and government have long accused Afghanistan of providing sanctuary to militant groups, something its Taliban leaders have denied. Scores of injured hostages have been taken to hospital for treatment, with an effort to rescue those still kidnapped underway. An evolving insurgency Tuesdays kidnapping is an audacious moment for a separatist insurgency who seeks greater political autonomy and economic development in the strategically important and mineral-rich mountainous region. But it also highlights the ever-deteriorating security situation there  one that Pakistans government has been grappling with for decades. Balochistans population  made up mostly of the ethnic Baloch group  is deeply disenfranchised, impoverished, and has been growing increasingly alienated from the federal government by decades of policies widely seen as discriminatory. An insurgency there has been ongoing for decades but has gained traction in recent years since the provinces deep-water Gwadar port was leased to China, the jewel in the crown of Beijings Belt and Road infrastructure push in Pakistan. The port, often touted as the next Dubai, has become a security nightmare with persistent bombings of vehicles carrying Chinese workers, resulting in many deaths. Some analysts said Tuesdays attack marked an escalation in the sophistication of attacks by the insurgents. The larger point that the Pakistani state is not grasping  is that its not business as usual anymore, said Abdul Basit, a Senior Associate Fellow at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore. The insurgency has evolved both in its strategy and scale, he added, saying Pakistans approach to tackle the Baloch militants seem to have run its course. Instead of revising its counterproductive policies, it is persisting with them, resulting in recurrent security and intelligence failures, Basit said. The BLA has been responsible for the deadliest attacks in Pakistan in the past year. A suicide bombing by the BLA at a train station in Quetta killed more than two dozen people last November. The previous month, it claimed responsibility for an attack on a convoy of Chinese engineers, resulting in two deaths. In the wake of Tuesdays attack, Pakistans Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif vowed to continue to fight against the monster of terrorism until it is completely eradicated from the country. In a statement, he said the terrorists targeting of innocent passengers during the peaceful and blessed month of Ramadan is a clear reflection that these terrorists have no connection with the religion of Islam, Pakistan and Balochistan. Analysts say such attacks need urgent attention from the federal government. (Tuesdays attack) has gained global attention and it will worry China, which has its investments in the province  more than any other state, said Basit. A major reset of existing security paradigm is required in Balochistan. Source: CNN --Agencies",

        "title": "Researchers create gel that can self-heal like human skin: Study",
        "date": "March 12, 2025 06:31 pm",
        "content": "Gels are commonly used products that are soft and sticky. They can be applied to hair or to the jelly-like components in various foodstuffs. While human skin shares gel-like characteristics, it has unique qualities that are very hard to replicate. It combines high stiffness with flexibility, and it has remarkable self-healing capabilities, often healing completely within 24 hours after injury. Until now, artificial gels have either replicated this high stiffness or natural skins self-healing properties, but not both. Now, a team of researchers from Aalto University and the University of Bayreuth is the first to develop a hydrogel with a unique structure that overcomes earlier limitations, opening the door to applications such as drug delivery, wound healing, soft robotics sensors, and artificial skin. In the breakthrough study, the researchers added exceptionally large and ultra-thin specific clay nanosheets to hydrogels, which are typically soft and squishy. The result is a highly ordered structure with densely entangled polymers between nanosheets, improving the hydrogels mechanical properties and allowing it to self-heal. The secret of the material lies not only in the organised arrangement of the nanosheets, but also in the polymers that are entangled between them  and a process thats as simple as baking. Postdoctoral researcher Chen Liang mixed a powder of monomers with water that contains nanosheets. The mixture was then placed under a UV lamp  similar to that used to set gel nail polish. The UV-radiation from the lamp causes the individual molecules to bind together so that everything becomes an elastic solid  a gel, Liang explains. Entanglement means that the thin polymer layers start to twist around each other like tiny wool yarns, but in a random order, adds Hang Zhang, from Aalto University. When the polymers are fully entangled, they are indistinguishable from each other. They are very dynamic and mobile at the molecular level, and when you cut them, they start to intertwine again. Four hours after cutting it with a knife, the material is already 80 or 90 percent self-healed. After 24 hours, it is typically completely repaired. Furthermore, a one-millimetre-thick hydrogel contains 10,000 layers of nanosheets, which makes the material as stiff as human skin, and gives it a comparable degree of stretch and flexibility. Stiff, strong and self-healing hydrogels have long been a challenge. We have discovered a mechanism to strengthen the conventionally soft hydrogels. This could revolutionise the development of new materials with bio-inspired properties, says Zhang. This work is an exciting example of how biological materials inspire us to look for new combinations of properties for synthetic materials. Imagine robots with robust, self-healing skins or synthetic tissues that autonomously repair, says Olli Ikkala, from Aalto University. And even though there may be some way to go before real-world application, the current results represent a pivotal leap. Its the kind of fundamental discovery that could renew the rules of material design. Source: ANI --Agencies",

        "content": "There are endless things to consider when moving to another country. What is the culture like? How easy is it to find work? How are the transport links? How happy are the locals? And for families hoping to move abroad, there are even more questions  think safety, healthcare, or education systems, for example. Remitly, an American remittance company helping users send money worldwide, has launched a new immigration index designed to help inform those considering relocating. The report, released in March 2025, ranks 82 countries across 24 factors, from healthcare quality and economic strength to safety metrics and digital connectivity, assigning each with a total score of 100. One such factor considers how family-friendly a country is, looking at data points such as the quality and accessibility of education in each nation. The company used statistics including the average years of schooling adults have completed, the expected years of schooling for children in each country, and the average cost of childcare per year. The report then generated a score for each nation to establish the most family-friendly country. Is the UK on the list of family-friendly countries? The UK does not feature in this report for family-friendly countries. However, it does feature in the list of best countries to relocate to. Coming in 19th place with a score of 46.5, losing out to the likes of the US in 7th place, Germany in 11th place and Japan in 18th place. What is the most family-friendly country in the world? Sri Lanka came in first place. The island nation achieved an impressive score for its education system (0.7 out of 1.0) and a low annual childcare cost of 354.60 per year (compared to 16,439.40 in the US, which ranked in 10th place). Its no surprise that Sri Lanka ranked so highly in this list  in fact, we named the country one of our favourite places to go for multi-gen megatrips in 2025, due to its welcoming nature, focus on outdoor activities and family-friendly Sri Lankan hotels. The country is home to some incredible wildlife, from vast national parks and sprawling beaches, plus there is fascinating history, creative coastlines, delicious food and an excellent shopping scene.

        "date": "March 13, 2025 06:15 am",
        "content": "U.S. arms deliveries to Ukraine resumed Wednesday, officials said, a day after the Trump administration lifted its suspension of military aid for Kyiv in its fight against Russias invasion, and officials awaited the Kremlins response to a proposed 30-day ceasefire endorsed by Ukraine. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said its important not to get ahead of the question of responding to the ceasefire, which was proposed by Washington. He told reporters that Moscow is awaiting detailed information from the U.S. and suggested that Russia must get that before it can take a position. The Kremlin has previously opposed anything short of a permanent end to the conflict and has not accepted any concessions. U.S. President Donald Trump wants to end the three-year war and pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to enter talks. The suspension of U.S. assistance happened days after Zelenskyy and Trump argued about the conflict in a tense White House meeting. The administrations decision to resume military aid after talks Tuesday with senior Ukrainian officials in Saudi Arabia marked a sharp shift in its stance. Trump said its up to Russia now as his administration presses Moscow to agree to the ceasefire. And hopefully we can get a ceasefire from Russia, Trump said Wednesday in an extended exchange with reporters during an Oval Office meeting with Micheál Martin, the prime minster of Ireland. And if we do, I think that would be 80 of the way to getting this horrible bloodbath ended. The U.S. president again made veiled threats of hitting Russia with new sanctions. We can, but I hope its not going to be necessary, Trump said. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who led the American delegation to Saudi Arabia, where Ukraine consented to the U.S. ceasefire proposal, said Washington will pursue multiple points of contacts with Russia to see if President Vladimir Putin is ready to negotiate an end to the war. He declined to give details or say what steps might be taken if Putin refuses to engage. The U.S. hopes to see Russia stop attacks on Ukraine within the next few days as a first step, Rubio said at a refueling stop Wednesday in Shannon, Ireland, on his way to talks in Canada with other Group of Seven leading industrialized nations. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told Fox News that national security adviser Mike Waltz spoke Wednesday with his Russian counterpart. She also confirmed that Trumps special envoy, Steve Witkoff, will head to Moscow for talks with Russian officials. She did not say with whom Witkoff planned to meet. A person familiar with the matter said Witkoff is expected to meet with Putin later his week. The person was not authorized to comment publicly and spoke on the condition of anonymity. Ukraine says ceasefire would allow time to plan end of war Zelenskyy said the 30-day ceasefire would allow the sides to fully prepare a step-by-step plan for ending the war, including security guarantees for Ukraine. Technical questions over how to effectively monitor a truce along the roughly 1,000-kilometer (600-mile) front line, where small but deadly drones are common, are very important, Zelenskyy told reporters Wednesday in Kyiv. Arms deliveries to Ukraine have already resumed through a Polish logistics center, the foreign ministers of Ukraine and Poland announced Wednesday. The deliveries go through a NATO and U.S. hub in the eastern Polish city of Rzeszow thats has been used to ferry Western weapons into neighboring Ukraine about 70 kilometers (45 miles) away. The American military help is vital for Ukraines shorthanded and weary army, which is having a tough time keeping Russias bigger military force at bay. For Russia, the American aid spells potentially more difficulty in achieving war aims, and it could make Washingtons peace efforts a tougher sell in Moscow. The U.S. government has also restored Ukraines access to unclassified commercial satellite pictures provided by Maxar Technologies through a program Washington runs, Maxar spokesperson Tomi Maxted told The Associated Press. The images help Ukraine plan attacks, assess their success and monitor Russian movements. In other developments, officials acknowledged Wednesday that Kyiv no longer has any of the longer-range Army Tactical Missile System, or ATACMS, missiles. According to a U.S. official and a Ukrainian lawmaker on the countrys defense committee, Ukraine has run out of the ATACMs. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity to provide military weapons details. The U.S. official said the U.S. provided fewer than 40 of those missiles overall and that Ukraine ran out of them in late January. Senior U.S. defense leaders, including the previous Pentagon chief, Lloyd Austin, had made it clear that only a limited number of the ATACMs would be delivered and that the U.S. and NATO allies considered other weapons to be more valuable in the fight. Putin visits troops trying to regain control of Kursk region Putin on Wednesday visited military headquarters in Russias Kursk region, where Kremlin troops are close to driving out Ukrainian forces. In the last few days, the Russian military entered the town of Sudzha, near the border, that had been occupied by Ukrainian soldiers since they launched a surprise incursion into Kursk in August. Speaking to commanders, Putin said he expected the military to completely free the Kursk region from the enemy in the nearest future. Chief of the Russian militarys general staff, Gen. Valery Gerasimov, reported to Putin that Russian troops crossed into Ukraines northeastern Sumy region in several places and were destroying the enemy reserves and expanding a security zone there. In a signal that Moscow could try to expand its land gains by capturing parts of the Sumy region, Putin said that in the future its necessary to think about creating a security zone alongside the state border. Ukraines raid into Kursk was the first foreign occupation of Russian territory since World War II. Ukrainian troops held on for months despite intense pressure from tens of thousands of Russian and North Korean troops. Meanwhile in Ukraine, Russian ballistic missiles killed at least five civilians, officials said Wednesday. Russian officials are wary about the U.S.-Ukraine talks Russian lawmakers signaled wariness about the prospect of a ceasefire. Any agreements (with the understanding of the need for compromise) should be on our terms, not American, senior Russian senator Konstantin Kosachev noted in a post on the messaging app Telegram. Lawmaker Mikhail Sheremet told the state news agency Tass that Russia is not interested in continuing the war, but at the same time Moscow will not tolerate being strung along. The outcome of the Saudi Arabia talks places the onus on Washington to persuade Moscow to accept and implement the ceasefire, said John Hardie, a defense analyst and deputy director of the Russia program at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a Washington-based research institute. Russias foreign intelligence service, known as the SVR, reported Wednesday that the services chief, Sergei Naryshkin, spoke by phone Tuesday with CIA Director John Ratcliffe. The two discussed cooperation in areas of common interest and the resolution of crisis situations, according to a statement by the SVR. Source: AP --Agencies",

The incident has sparked widespread outrage among the medical community, with healthcare workers urging authorities to implement stronger safety protocols within hospital premises.",

        "title": "21 hostages killed by insurgents after train attack in Pakistan, all others freed",
        "date": "March 13, 2025 09:09 am",
        "content": "Insurgents who attacked a passenger train carrying 440 passengers in restive southwestern Pakistan killed 21 hostages before security forces killed all 33 of the assailants, and all other passengers were rescued, officials said Wednesday. Information Minister Attaullah Tarar said the separatist Baloch Liberation Army group was behind the attack, and the military operation has successfully reached its logical conclusion. He said no passengers died because of the operation, and praised the military for averting a potential catastrophe. The provinces chief minister, Sarfraz Bugti, told a provincial assembly that troops killed all insurgents involved. Three soldiers who had been guarding the railroad track were also killed in the attack that began Tuesday in restive Balochistan province, the military spokesman, Lt. Gen. Ahmad Sharif, told local media. The Baloch Liberation Army claimed responsibility for attacking the train in a tunnel in a remote part of Balochistan. Spokesman Jeeyand Baloch had said the group was ready to free passengers if authorities agreed to release jailed militants. The BLA regularly targets Pakistani security forces and has also attacked civilians, including Chinese nationals among the thousands working on multibillion-dollar infrastructure projects in Balochistan. Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said her country will continue to firmly support Pakistan in advancing its counterterrorism efforts. Some relatives of hostages were angry at Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi, who last year claimed that the BLA was not a threat and an ordinary police inspector could fix this situation. What happened? The train had been traveling from Quetta to the northern city of Peshawar. Officials say the Jafer Express train was partially inside a tunnel when the militants blew up the tracks, forcing the engine and nine coaches to stop. Oil- and mineral-rich Balochistan is Pakistans largest and least populated province. Its a hub for the countrys ethnic Baloch minority, whose members say they face discrimination and exploitation by the central government. Balochistan borders Iran and Afghanistan and has long been the scene of insurgency. Separatists demand greater autonomy from the government in Islamabad and a larger share of the regions natural resources. Insurgencies on either side of the Iran-Pakistan border have frustrated both countries, whose governments suspect each other of supporting  or at least tolerating  some groups. Iran has sought help from Pakistan in countering the threat from the militant group Jaish al-Adl. Pakistan wants Tehran to deny sanctuaries to BLA fighters. What did the hijackers want? Members of the military frequently use trains to travel from Balochistans capital, Quetta, to other parts of the country. In November, the BLA carried out a suicide bombing at a train station in Quetta, killing 26 people. The BLA had warned that hostages lives would be at risk if the government did not negotiate. Analysts said the attack and its focus on civilians could backfire. After failing to damage the Pakistan Army within Balochistan, BLA has shifted its targets from military to unarmed civilians. This may give them instant public and media attention, but it will weaken their support base within the civilian population, which is their ultimate objective, said Syed Muhammad Ali, an Islamabad-based independent security analyst. Rescued passengers, including women and children, were being sent to their hometowns. Some of the injured were taken to Quetta, about 100 kilometers (62 miles) away. Source: AP --Agencies",

        "title": "Intel appoints chip industry veteran Lip-Bu Tan as CEO",
        "date": "March 13, 2025 09:31 am",
        "content": "Intel on Wednesday named former board member and chip industry veteran Lip-Bu Tan as its CEO and signaled the struggling but storied chipmaker was unlikely to split up its chip-design and manufacturing operations. The appointment, effective March 18, comes three months after Intel ousted CEO and company veteran Pat Gelsinger, whose costly and ambitious plan to turn the company around was faltering and sapping investor confidence. Tan, a former Intel board member, had been seen as a CEO contender thanks to his deep experience in the chip industry as well as a longtime technology investor in promising startups. He was approached by Intels board in December to gauge his interest in taking up the job, Reuters had reported. Together, we will work hard to restore Intels position as a world-class products company, establish ourselves as a world-class foundry and delight our customers like never before, Tan said in a letter to Intel employees on Wednesday. Intel shares surged 12 in extended trading on Wednesday, and analysts welcomed the move that they said was likely to bring some stability to the chipmaker. The companys stock had declined 60 in 2024. Intel is undergoing a historic transition as it attempts to emerge from one of its bleakest periods. While struggling to cash in on a boom in investment in advanced AI chips that has fired up the fortunes of market leader Nvidia and other chipmakers, the company is spending heavily to become a contract manufacturer of chips for other companies, leading some investors to worry about pressure on its cash flows. Media reports in the past two months said chip rivals including Broadcom were evaluating Intels chip design and marketing business, while TSMC has separately studied controlling some or all of Intels chip plants, potentially as part of an investor consortium or other structure. Reuters reported on Tuesday that TSMC had approached some of Intels biggest potential manufacturing customers about forming a joint venture to operate Intels factories, after U.S. President Donald Trumps administration requested TSMC to help turn around the troubled chipmaker. This (Tans appointment) is welcome news, said Jack E. Gold, analyst and president of J. Gold Associates, which covers the chip industry. Tan has an intrinsic understanding of the semiconductor industry, both from a product design aspect as well as the needs of enabling chip manufacturing - an area that Intel Foundry needs help in making their tools more user-friendly and accessible for potential customers, he said. Gold and other analysts agreed that Tans messaging looked like he wanted to keep the company together, though they said any transformation of the chipmaker would take years and require investors to be patient. Long Admired Intel is a company I have long admired, Tan said in his letter on Wednesday, expressing confidence in turning the business around. Tan, 65, is a Malaysian-born executive who grew up in Singapore and holds degrees in physics, nuclear engineering and business administration. He served as CEO of Intel supplier and chip-design software Cadence Design Systems from 2009 to 2021. During his term, the companys revenue and stock surged. Tan left Intels board last year over disagreements on how to turn around the company. He grew frustrated by the companys large workforce, its approach to contract manufacturing and Intels risk-averse and bureaucratic culture, Reuters previously reported. Tan will rejoin the board, Intel said. Tan brings stability and experience to a role that needs someone of his caliber, which is why I believe the company will likely stay the course with his appointment and continue to develop foundry and product, said Anshel Sag, principal analyst at Moor Insights  Strategy. Tans appointment comes as Trump pushes for more manufacturing in the country, threatening tariffs on imports that have roiled global markets for weeks. While Trump has made no direct comment about Intel publicly, he has said that Asian countries including Taiwan have snatched away the United States edge in chipmaking. Earlier this month, Intel rival TSMC said at a press event with Trump that it plans to make a fresh 100 billion investment in the U.S. that involves building five additional chip facilities. Trump, though, is trying to kill a 2022 bipartisan law to give 52.7 billion in subsidies for chips, under which Intel has received grants. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "date": "March 13, 2025 01:31 pm",
        "content": "Actor Ravi Mohan, who has completed 20 years in the Tamil film industry as a bankable hero, is now all set to turn a director as well. If rumours doing the rounds in the industry are to be believed, Ravi Mohan will be directing his first film, featuring actor Yogi Babu in the lead. Earlier this year, Ravi, during an interaction with journalists, had admitted that he had a script ready for Yogi Babu and that he intends to turn director at one point. However, he had then not specified when he intended to make the big move. Now, industry insiders claim that Ravi Mohan will be turning director soon after he completes Ganesh K Babus Karathey Babu and director Sudha Kongaras much-awaited period film Parasakthi, featuring Sivakarthikeyan in the lead. Sources claim that if all goes well, Ravi may begin the shooting of his first film as director in July this year. Yogi Babu will play the lead in the film, which sources point out, will be an out-and-out comedy entertainer. However, there has be no official confirmation about this project from Ravi Mohans side so far. All of Ravi Mohans upcoming films have huge expectations riding on them.

        "title": "Russia lays out demands for talks with US on Ukraine, sources say",
        "date": "March 13, 2025 01:36 pm",
        "content": "Russia has presented the U.S. with a list of demands for a deal to end its war against Ukraine and reset relations with Washington, according to two people familiar with the matter. It is not clear what exactly Moscow included on its list or whether it is willing to engage in peace talks with Kyiv prior to their acceptance. Russian and American officials discussed the terms during in-person and virtual conversations over the last three weeks, the people said. They described the Kremlins terms as broad and similar to demands it previously has presented to Ukraine, the U.S. and NATO. Those earlier terms included no NATO membership for Kyiv, an agreement not to deploy foreign troops in Ukraine and international recognition of President Vladimir Putins claim that Crimea and four provinces belong to Russia. Russia, in recent years, also has demanded the U.S. and NATO address what it has called the root causes of the war, including NATOs eastward expansion. U.S. President Donald Trump is awaiting word from Putin on whether he will agree to a 30-day truce that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Tuesday he would accept as a first step toward peace talks. Putins commitment to a potential ceasefire agreement is still uncertain, with details yet to be finalized. Some U.S. officials, lawmakers and experts fear that Putin, a former KGB officer, would use a truce to intensify what they say is an effort to divide the U.S., Ukraine and Europe and undermine any talks. The Russian embassy in Washington and the White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In Kyiv, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy hailed this weeks meeting in Saudi Arabia between U.S. and Ukrainian officials as constructive, and said a potential 30-day ceasefire with Russia could be used to draft a broader peace deal. Moscow has raised many of these same demands over the last two decades, some making their way into formal negotiations with the U.S. and Europe. Most recently, Moscow discussed them with the Biden administration in a series of meetings in late 2021 and early 2022 as tens of thousands of Russian troops sat on Ukraines border, awaiting the order to invade. They included demands that would constrain U.S. and NATO military operations from Eastern Europe to Central Asia. While rejecting some of the terms, the Biden administration sought to forestall the invasion by engaging with Russia on several of them, according to U.S. government documents reviewed by Reuters and multiple former U.S. officials. The effort failed and Russia attacked on February 24, 2022. U.S. and Russian officials in recent weeks have said that a draft agreement discussed by Washington, Kyiv and Moscow in Istanbul in 2022 could be a starting point for peace talks. The agreement never went through. In those talks, Russia demanded that Ukraine give up its NATO ambitions and accept a permanent nuclear-free status. It also demanded a veto over actions by countries that wanted to assist Ukraine in the event of war. The Trump administration has not explained how it is approaching its negotiations with Moscow. The two sides are engaged in two separate conversations: one on resetting U.S.-Russia relations and the other on a Ukraine peace agreement. The administration appears to be divided on how to proceed. U.S. Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff, who is helping lead the discussion with Moscow, last month on CNN described the Istanbul talks as cogent and substantive negotiations and said that they could be a guidepost to get a peace deal done. But Trumps top Ukraine and Russia envoy, retired Gen. Keith Kellogg, told a Council on Foreign Relations audience last week that he did not see the Istanbul agreement as a starting point. I think we have to develop something entirely new, he said. Old Demands Experts say Russias demands likely are not only intended to shape an eventual agreement with Ukraine, but also to be the basis of accords with its Western supporters. Russia has made similar demands of the U.S. over the last two decades  demands that would limit the Wests ability to build a stronger military presence in Europe and potentially allow Putin to expand his influence in the continent. Theres no sign that the Russians are willing to make any concessions, said Angela Stent, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who was the top U.S. intelligence analyst for Russia and Eurasia. The demands havent changed at all. I think they are not really interested in peace or a meaningful ceasefire. In their effort to forestall what U.S. intelligence officials concluded was an imminent Russian invasion, senior Biden administration officials engaged with Russian counterparts on three of the Kremlins demands, according to the U.S. government documents reviewed by Reuters. They were a ban on military exercises by U.S. and other NATO forces on the territories of new alliance members and a ban on U.S. intermediate-range missile deployments in Europe or elsewhere within range of Russian territory, according to the documents. The Russians also sought to bar military exercises by the U.S. or NATO from Eastern Europe to the Caucasus and Central Asia, the documents showed. These are the same Russian demands that have been made since 1945, said Kori Schake, a former Pentagon official who directs foreign and defense policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute. With the behavior of the Trump administration in recent weeks, Europeans arent just scared were abandoning them, theyre afraid weve joined the enemy. Source: Reuters --Agencies",
