        "title": "Fifth person confirmed to be cured of HIV",
        "date": "February 21, 2023 09:49 pm",
        "content": "Researchers are announcing that a 53-year-old man in Germany has been cured of HIV. Referred to as the Dusseldorf patient to protect his privacy, researchers said he is the fifth confirmed case of an HIV cure. Although the details of his successful treatment were first announced at a conference in 2019, researchers could not confirm he had been officially cured at that time. Today, researchers announced the Dusseldorf patient still has no detectable virus in his body, even after stopping his HIV medication four years ago. Its really cure, and not just, you know, long term remission, said Dr. Bjorn-Erik Ole Jensen, who presented details of the case in a new publication in Nature Medicine. This obviously positive symbol makes hope, but theres a lot of work to do, Jensen said For most people, HIV is a lifelong infection, and the virus is never fully eradicated. Thanks to modern medication, people with HIV can live long and healthy lives. The Dusseldorf patient joins a small group of people who have been cured under extreme circumstances after a stem cell transplant, typically only performed in cancer patients who dont have any other options. A stem cell transplant is a high-risk procedure that effectively replaces a persons immune system. The primary goal is to cure someones cancer, but the procedure has also led to an HIV cure in a handful of cases. HIV, or human immunodeficiency virus, enters and destroys the cells of the immune system. Without treatment, the continued damage can lead to AIDS, or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, where a person cannot fight even a small infection. With about 38.4 million people globally living with HIV, treatments have come a long way. Modern medication can keep the virus at bay, and studies looking into preventing HIV infection with a vaccine are also underway. The first person with HIV cure was Timothy Ray Brown. Researchers published his case as the Berlin patient in 2009. That was followed by the London patient published in 2019. Most recently, The City of Hope and New York patients were published in 2022. I think we can get a lot of insights from this patient and from these similar cases of HIV cure, Jensen said. These insights give us some hints where we could go to make the strategy safer. All four of these patients had undergone stem cell transplants for their blood cancer treatment. Their donors also had the same HIV-resistant mutation that deletes a protein called CCR5, which HIV normally uses to enter the cell. Only 1 of the total population carries this genetic mutation that makes them resistant to HIV. When you hear about these HIV cure, its obviously, you know, incredible, given how challenging its been. But, it still remains the exception to the rule, said Dr. Todd Ellerin, director of infectious disease at South Shore Health. The stem cell transplantation is a complicated procedure that comes with many risks, and it is too risky to offer it as a cure for everyone with HIV. However, scientists are hopeful. Each time they cure a new patient, they gain valuable research insights that help them understand what it would take to find a cure for everyone. It is obviously a step forward in advancing the science and having us sort of understanding, in some ways, what it takes to cure HIV, Ellerin said. Source - ABC News - Agencies",

        "date": "February 21, 2023 10:31 pm",
        "content": "The newly formed Freedom Peoples Alliance (FPA) has raised concerns over the recent resistance displayed by the Ministry of Finance to release the fund required to hold to upcoming 2023 Local Government (LG) election. In a letter addressed to the President, members of the FPA stated that in the event the 2023 LG polls are not held citing reasons if inadequate finances and resources, it will inevitably result in withholding the people from their right of suffrage, which the party deemed the source from which all other democratic rights and freedoms flow. Speaking on the recent decision made by the Finance Ministry to refrain from releasing the required funds, the FPA asserted that as the necessary funds were already allocated by the Parliament in the 2023 Budget which was passed in Parliament last year, thereby making it the imperative duty of the Secretary to the Ministry to paces these resources at the disposal of the Election Commission. Failure to do so, manifestly, exposes this official to serious consequences arising from international violation of the Constitution, the letter read. They further cited the judgment made in the landmark case of Mohamed Hussain v Election Commission of Sri Lanka, in which the court held that the failure to hold elections on the due date or postponing is a violation of the fundamental rights of the people. Thus, the political party urged all relevant authorities to desist the Sri Lankan government from following a course of action which is gravely detrimental to the nation, stating that the attempts made by the government to obstruct the LG polls jeopardises the survival of the democratic system of governance in Sri Lanka.",

        "date": "February 22, 2023 09:56 am",
        "content": "The death toll from heavy rains that devastated coastal areas of Brazils southeastern Sao Paulo state rose to 46 people on Tuesday, according to officials, with more precipitation expected. Massive rainfalls over the weekend have caused landslides and flooding in coastal towns in the southeast of the country. Almost 2,500 people are still displaced or homeless, the Sao Paulo state government said in a statement, adding that rescue work is ongoing. The city of Sao Sebastiao bore the brunt of the human toll, with 45 of the reported deaths. President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva flew over the city alongside cabinet ministers on Monday, pledging to rebuild the town of some 91,000 people by constructing new houses in safer places. More rain is forecast for the city in the coming days. The Sao Sebastiao government said that by Friday another 200mm (nearly 8 inches) of rain are expected to hit the region and warned of further risks of landslides and flooding. Since the weekend, the coastal area of the countrys wealthiest state was hit by more than 600mm (23.6 inches) of rain, which the government said was the highest cumulative figure ever in Brazil. The floods in coastal Sao Paulo state were the latest in a series of such disasters to recently strike Brazil, where shoddy construction, often on hillsides, can have tragic consequences during the countrys rainy season. Sao Paulo state Governor Tarcisio de Freitas said the Navy would build a field hospital for victims starting on Thursday. There will be up to 300 beds in the infirmary, with orthopedic, clinical, trauma, and psychiatric professionals, said Freitas. The deluge happened as tourists thronged to Brazils beaches during the annual Carnival holiday, likely making the human toll much worse. Source: Reuters -Agencies",

The refugee wanted to be deported to Sri Lanka to join his parents. The refugee identified as Joy came to India as an 8-year-old boy 25 years ago. After leaving the refugee camp in Mandapam where he stayed, the youth has been submitting petitions to various District Collectors appealing them to take steps to deport him to Sri Lanka. Frustrated over the delay in sending him back to his motherland, he attempted to end his life at the Kanniyakumari Collectorate in Nagercoil and was arrested by the police. After being released, Mr. Joy was sent back to Mandapam refugee camp from where he went to Tirunelveli Collectorate on Tuesday to submit a petition seeking deportation. Mr. Joy came out of the Collectorates main building and argued vehemently with the police personnel surrounding him as he had attempted earlier to end his life in Kanniyakumari Collectorate. Mr. Joy was walking towards the Collectorate main gate when he broke free and tried to harm himself with a window glass. When two policemen tried to snatch the glass piece from the violent youth, constable Shanmugavel sustained a bleeding injury on his hand and was taken to Tirunelveli Medical College Hospital for treatment. Mr. Joy was taken in for interrogation.

        "date": "February 22, 2023 01:55 pm",
        "content": "Pakistan and Sri Lanka are getting close to securing bailouts from the International Monetary Fund after taking a series of steps including tax increases to boost their beleaguered economies. Pakistan has taken all the measures needed to unfreeze a 6.5 billion credit line and expects to clinch the deal any day now, Commerce Minister Syed Naveed Qamar said in an interview in Washington Tuesday. Sri Lanka has completed a list of 15 tasks assigned by the lender to clinch a 2.9 billion loan program, according to President Ranil Wickremesinghe. The IMF funds are crucial to stabilizing Pakistan and Sri Lanka where a funding crunch, supply shortages and surging import prices are threatening to destabilize their economies. Pakistan faces an additional threat of a debt default. The IMF agreement will give investors and creditors confidence that Pakistans economy is now stabilizing, has taken all the right steps, so in that sense their money will remain protected, Qamar said. The IMF program is the beginning, not the culmination, of all other monies flowing in. Pakistans dollar bonds due April 2031 fell to 41.25 cents on the dollar, extending its decline for a third day. Sri Lankan notes due March 2030 were little changed at 34.80 cents on the dollar. Sri Lankas reserves are insufficient to repay its foreign debt obligations in the first half of this year. Pakistans reserves have dwindled to levels that can support less than a month of imports. Fitch Ratings cut Pakistans credit score deeper into junk territory this month, the second time since October. A pickup in imports once the nation boosts its reserves will also benefit exports, the minister said. Limited reserves restricted Pakistans ability to fund imports, including intermediary goods, and stranded thousands of containers of supplies at ports. Pakistan authorities have taken steps including increasing taxes, cutting subsidies and devaluing its currency to meet IMF conditions. Severe supply shortages stoked inflation to a 48-year high in January and forced plant shutdowns, putting tens of thousands of jobs at risk. Meanwhile, Sri Lanka has informed the IMF on its progress in meeting the conditions on Feb. 15, the presidents office said in a statement. The cabinet of ministers this month cleared a bill for a monetary law giving more independence to the central bank, and increased electricity tariffs for the second time in six months.

Accordingly, those registered as various service providers to the tourism industry under the SLTDA are eligible to obtain the Travel Card, granting them access to special benefits when dealing with tourists, Tourism Minister Harin Fernando said. He further noted that the card will be made available not only to service providers in the tourism industry, but also to those tourists visiting Sri Lanka. The initiative is expected to enable the provision of several qualitative services within the industry, such as clear, updated statistics on the number of tourists visiting Sri Lanka, the exchanging of foreign currencies brought by tourists and ensuring that tourists are able to obtain all required goods and services in a safe manner.",

According to a report from TechCrunch, the data was accessed via a phishing attempt on December 4th. A collective of malware and cybersecurity experts known as vx-underground obtained screenshots of the allegedly stolen data that included a Call of Duty content schedule. Another website, Insider Gaming, reportedly confirmed the breach, stating that additional information such as employees full names, emails, phone numbers, salaries, places of work, and more were also accessed. In an email to The Verge, Activision Blizzard spokesperson Joe Christinat wrote, On December 4, 2022, our information security team swiftly addressed an SMS phishing attempt and quickly resolved it. Following a thorough investigation, we determined that no sensitive employee data, game code, or player data was accessed. The carefully worded statement confirms the event took place but denies the extent of the breach as reported by TechCrunch and Insider Gaming, while also not confirming the validity of the Call of Duty content leak. Video game leaks are becoming all too frequent. In September 2022, a hacker purportedly responsible for the massive Uber hack leaked footage from the still-in-development Grand Theft Auto VI. Rockstar Games confirmed the leak, stating that the event would not impact the games development. Source - The Verge -Agencies",

        "date": "February 22, 2023 04:18 pm",
        "content": "During an event held this morning (Feb. 22) at Royal College, Colombo, President Ranil Wickremesinghe urged all citizens, including politicians, professionals, teachers, those engaged in agriculture, the business community, and members of the security forces, police and civil servants, to work together to overcome the current economic crisis and promote reconciliation efforts. The event was held to honour President Wickremesinghe, who is an alumnus of Royal College. The President called upon the present generation of Royalists to dedicate themselves to serving the country and transforming it into a place where they would like to reside. He urged young Royalists to take up the challenge and shape the future of the nation. President Wickremesinghe also highlighted that Royalists are trained to live in harmony with all races and religions, emphasizing that the country cannot be divided on the basis of race or religion. He invited all politicians who are also Royalists to collaborate with the government in its efforts to revive the countrys failing economy, emphasizing that it was not a political invitation, but rather a call for a collective effort to address the economic crisis. The statement made by President Ranil Wickremesinghe is as follows: I have come here on the invitation of the Prefects of Royal College to address you. I know that youre going to stand in the sun. I wont make my speech long. I myself have stood in the sun like this and said when they will shut up so we can go back to the classroom. And I dont want that to happen to me. Knowing that the Prime Minister has already said that he will not speak, but he will be the Chief Guest at the prize giving, where you will be under a hall. Before I start to say a few words, I must thank the principals who moulded me and the Prime Minister Dinesh Gunawardena. Mr Disa Bandaranayake, Mr H.D. Sugathapala, headmasters of the Royal Primary, Mr Dudley Silva and Mr Bogoda Premanath. We must thank them for all the influence that they and the other masters and lady teachers had on us in moulding our character. I must also thank another member of the former Royal College Union Council, Mr Dian Pieris, who, together with me, stood up to save the name of Royal College and for all the other members of the Council who supported us. Otherwise, you would have had another name. But we honoured the intention that the country must have a school named after the President. President Jayawardene in 1978 inaugurated the Presidents college in Sri Jayawardhanapura, Kote, the new capital. I come here together with the Prime Minister to address you while we have also established another achievement of Royal College, where the President and the Prime Minister are from the same school and from the same class. Royals history in politics goes back to about 1860 onwards. A few years after the Colombo Academy started when some of its outstanding students became members of the Legislative Council. They are, as you see in some of their portraits, C. A. Lorenz, and James De Alvis both of who wanted more power in the council. Sir Richard Morgan, the first Asian to be knighted, member of the Executive Committee, acting Attorney General and also Acting Chief Justice and Sir Muthukumarasami. The four of them dominated the politics of Ceylon for the first few years of our modern history. We have Sir Ponnambalam Ramanathan the first member to be elected by the Sri Lankans. His opposing candidate who lost, Sir Marcus Fernando was also a Royalist. It was a question of deciding which Royalists you are going to vote for. 1915 was the turning point in our history when we decided after the 1915 riots that we will become an independent nation. It was Henry Pedris, a young old boy from this school who was executed by the British and we started the whole campaign. Sir Ponnamabam Rahmanathan pleaded for him in the legislative council, since he was also a Royalist. E.W. Perera and Sir James Pieris went to England to plead the cause of the Sinhala Buddhist leaders. They were also Royalists. Then all the key players on the Sri Lankan side in the 1915 riots were Royalists. After independence, we had Sir John Kotalawala as the first Prime Minister after whom the Defence University is named, and we had President J.R. Jayawardene. It was actually about, I would say nearly 44 years ago when we assembled at the quadrangle to felicitate him. So, Royal College today has in its records, four Prime Ministers and two Presidents. This is an outstanding record for any school. We also have a Sultan of Maldives who was also a Prime Minister, Muhammad Fareed Didi and the man who modernized the Maldives, President Maumoon Abdul Gayoom spent a year or more at Royal College. I think the disease of modernization, he must have gotten from Royal College. Now, we are here as the Royalists from the same class. There is another record. The first republican constitution was drafted by Dr. Colvin R. de Silva, an old Royalist. The second republican constitution was drafted by J.R. Jayawardene, his classmate. Royalists have done it so well that no one else can change it. Now I think we have equalled that record, when the Prime Minister and I, together with the late Mr Anura Bandaranaike and Mr Malik Samarawickrama established another record. Between us, two of us have held the presidency, some Prime Ministers and one has become the Speaker, two of us have been Leaders of the House and two of us have been Leaders of the Opposition. So this is what education at Royal has brought us and I hope you will do even better than us. That is my hope. Records are meant to be broken and not to be kept. Are any of you willing to break that record? So, I have come here to address you at a very difficult time. A situation we have not seen in the last 400 years. A complete collapse of the economy. I wont talk in general economic terms, but it affects all of you. In all our households, we didnt have fuel, and electricity and those who were farming didnt have fertilizer, we have to pay a lot of taxes and prices have gone up, inflation has come and every household has had to face the consequences. There was a total collapse of the country and when I took over the country, Mr Dinesh Gunawardane became Prime Minister, as I mentioned it was our duty to put the country first. I thought that I will take whatever decision that has to be taken to bring the economy back to at least be recognized in the world as no longer being bankrupt, within one year. It was a tough call, but I did not want it to go on for much longer. I dont want youll to suffer. We want to start fighting back and we want to have an economic resurrection. So I took all the decisions we had to take and the Prime Minister supported me. I knew the decisions I take are going to be unpalatable. It will make me unpopular. But, without those decisions, the country could not come right. And thats what I learnt in Royal College, do what is correct and do what is good for your country. Remember that. Every decision I have taken I have thought twice or thrice on what is the burden it will impose on us. How unpopular should I become? Should I even take this decision? And when I felt that it was in the countrys interest, I took it because my first task and our first task is to bring the economy back in order. We cant be a bankrupt country. We cant be a beggar nation, so we have to learn that there are hard decisions to be taken in life and those decisions have to be taken. And I assure you we will by this year, see a very good improvement in our economic condition and then we will set the stage for the economic recovery of this country, not to go back to an old system which brought us down, but to a new system. When I first came here and I came along, it was not even a ten-minute walk for me to come from there to here and we stood here in the hall, I realized one issue that all of us knew at that time. We thought we were in one of the best countries in the world because when we became independent, we were second to japan and the London Times said, we will be another Switzerland. So we were here at that time. Today, we are a country which has only Afghanistan below us. We dont know what the future is. So when we build this future, its an economy that must last for 25 years. It must be a new Constitution that must last for 100 years. It must be a society not for us. None of us here are going to live for 25 years. Its country for youll. Most of you here, in the first row, I dont think you will be even 45 years old in the next 25 years. And those in the back rows, the seniors will be around 50-55 years. That is the country you will have to live in and I want youll to decide what country we will live in. Not for us. That is the challenge you must take. I want youll to take that challenge and decide the future of the country. Just as much as President Jayawardane told us in 1977, youll decide what your future should be. So, I want you to be there and most of you here are living in a time when young people want to go abroad. They dont see a future. They want to go away. But, we are Royalists and we must fight back. Thats what we have learnt to do. As you know, we have to fight both alone and with many to uphold the values that we are committed to. So many of you will go abroad for studies and some of you will stay here. But, you must remember that this school made you a man and come here. I studied at Royal and I could have gone abroad to a university but I didnt. My father wanted me to go abroad but I stayed here because I valued what I had. And after I passed out I did not go abroad, I stayed here because I owed my education to the state which paid for me and which sentient to the Royal College. The Prime Minister went abroad and studied there but he remembered his obligation to the country, so he came back. And that is what you have to do. All of you come here to this school and for each of you selected, there were another 100 that were left behind. The country chose you to come here. The school chose you to come here. Then, you have the responsibility to come back to your country or stay in your country and build a new Sri Lanka. Are you as Royalists, willing to do that? That is your task, you should come back. You should fight the odds and go ahead because we have two difficult tasks in this country. One is to put the economy into order and the other is reconciliation. We cant be divided by race or religion. Royalists are not. So let us not do that and let us all get together. For all of you who come back, take your place in society and do your best. Whether you are at the highest level or whether you are running a normal business thats what you have to do. So, first I would like to ask all the old Royalists, to forget the differences and join together in bringing this country up. I am in no way telling all those in politics to join me, I am only asking all of them to get together to get over this economic crisis. I am asking those in the business world, those who are doing a small business, those who are carrying on their agriculture, and those who are in professions to join us to get over this crisis. I am asking those who are in the military services, police, public service and teaching services to join us in getting over the crisis. That is to get over it now. But, I want youll to come back and ensure that you build the country again to a developed economy in 25 years. That is the task that you have. I will not speak to you anymore but I would like to conclude with the words which we know of the oath taken by the young men of Athens, which we all had to learn in our days. I dont know whether you learn it now. But, I would like to repeat the commitment that they gave there which we also have to follow. We will transmit this city not only, not less but greater, better and more beautiful than when it was transmitted to us. That is the duty of all Royalists. The welcome speech was delivered by the Principal of Royal College R. M. M. Rathnayake while the vote of thanks was delivered by Head Prefect of Royal College Kavisha Ratnayake. Prime Minister Dinesh Gunawardena, Buddhasasana, Religious and Cultural Affairs Minister Vidura Wickremanayake, , Minister of Power and Energy Kanchana Wijesekara, State Minister of Finance Ranjith Siyambalapitiya, State Minister of Justice and Prison Affairs Anuradha Jayaratne, Members of Parliament Rauf Hakeem, Gevindu Kumarathunga, Priyankara Jayaratne, Duminda Dissanayake, Mahindananda Aluthgamage, Dilan Perera, Yadhamini Gunawardena, Kavinda Jayawardena, and Senior Adviser to the President on National Security and Chief of Presidential Staff Sagala Ratnayake, were also among those present at the occasion. --PMD--",

Jayasuriya made this statement in open court this morning (22 Feb.), when the magisterial inquest pertaining to the matter was taken up and the relevant facts were presented. The magistrate further ordered that the inquest in question be called in court next Monday, so as to report the progress on the appointment of the five-member committee. On 17 February, Jayasuriya ordered the appointment of a five-member expert committee to compile a report on Schaffters death, and called for a list of senior Judicial Medical Officers (JMOs) from the Director General of Health Services, while the University Grants Commission (UGC) was also ordered to submit a list of senior university lecturers who specialise in forensic medicine. Upon receiving the two lists, an experts committee will be appointed to probe the matter as contradictions have been observed in the post-mortem reports. The Janashakthi PLC Director was found tied up in the driving seat of his car at the Borella cemetery on 15 December 2022, and was rushed to the ICU of the National Hospital in Colombo, where he passed away while undergoing treatment.",

        "date": "February 22, 2023 05:20 pm",
        "content": "Seattle became the first U.S. city to outlaw caste discrimination on Tuesday, after its local council voted to add caste to the citys anti-discrimination laws. The move addresses an issue important to the areas South Asian diaspora, particularly the Indian and Hindu communities. Indias caste system is among the worlds oldest forms of rigid social stratification. The fight against caste discrimination is deeply connected to the fight against all forms of oppression, Kshama Sawant, an Indian American Seattle City Council member, said. The caste system dates back thousands of years and allows many privileges to upper castes but represses lower castes. The Dalit community is on the lowest rung of the Indian Hindu caste system and have been treated as untouchables. Caste discrimination doesnt only take place in other countries. It is faced by South Asian American and other immigrant working people in their workplaces, including in the tech sector, in Seattle and in cities around the country, Sawant said when her office introduced the proposal to ban caste-based discrimination in Seattle. Caste discrimination was outlawed in India over 70 years ago, yet bias persists, according to several studies in recent years, including one that found people from lower castes were underrepresented in higher-paying jobs. Even though India has banned untouchability, Dalits still face widespread abuse across that country, where their attempts at upward social mobility have at times been violently put down. Debate over the caste systems hierarchy is contentious in India and abroad, with the issue intertwined with religion. Some people say discrimination is now rare. Indian government policies reserving seats for lower-caste students at top Indian universities have helped many land tech jobs in the West in recent years. Activists opposing caste discrimination say it is no different from other forms of discrimination like racism and hence should be outlawed. U.S. discrimination laws ban ancestry discrimination but do not explicitly ban casteism. Source: Reuters -Agencies",

        "date": "February 22, 2023 06:29 pm",
        "content": "A national study conducted by local researchers has revealed that Sri Lanka has the highest rate of diabetes in Asia, with almost one in four adults having being diagnosed. The survey, done in 2019 by researchers from several local universities, the Medical Research Institute (MRI) in Colombo and the Institute for Health Policy (IHP), was the first national survey of diabetes in Sri Lanka that used the gold standard method of an oral glucose tolerance test to diagnose diabetes. Results of the study, which were published this week in the London-based British Medical Journal (BMJ) Open Diabetes Research and Care, revealed that almost one in four Sri Lankan adults (23) had diabetes, while another one in three (31) had high blood sugar levels. Meanwhile, the results also showed that almost two in five persons with diabetes (38) have not been diagnosed. The findings also indicated that geographically, the highest number of cases were reported in the Western Province , with as many as one in three cases (34) being reported from Colombo, while Jaffna and some other parts of the Northern and Eastern Provinces also reported high numbers. These findings indicate that Sri Lanka has the highest rate of diabetes in Asia, and in fact one of the highest in the world, since there are only a few countries  some small Pacific Islands and places like Egypt and the Gulf states  with higher rates, Dr. Ravi Rannan-Eliya, Executive Director of IHP and the lead investigator of the study, said. He further urged all persons to maintain healthy diets, and healthy weights and that they get tested on a regular basis, adding that the study further showed that diabetes develops at lower body weighs in Sri Lankans than in Europeans, with one in five locals (21) of normal body weight having diabetes, while over one million Sri Lankans remain unaware of the fact that they have the disease. Dr. Rannan-Eliya noted, however, that despite these efforts, it is inevitable that millions of Sri Lankans will develop diabetes in the next few decades. Thats a reality our health system is going to have to deal with for many years to come. At a time when many diabetes patients are struggling to obtain their medicines, this really underlies the importance of raising taxes in the long-term to properly fund the Ministry of Health medicines budget so that everyone can have access to the needed treatment, he said, commenting on the severity of the issue amidst Sri Lankas political, economic, financial and medical crises.",

        "content": "A bilateral Air Services Agreement has been signed between the Netherlands and Sri Lanka on Wednesday (Feb. 22) in the Hague, the Netherlands. The bilateral agreement will provide a stronger platform to further intensify connectivity both between the countries as well as the European and Asian regions, the Embassy of Sri Lanka in the Netherlands said. The instrument inked at the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs provides inter alia for the designated Airlines of both Countries to fly between Amsterdam and Katunayake and beyond their respective territories. Issuing a statement, the Embassy of Sri Lanka in the Netherlands noted that while the agreement broadens avenues for leisure and business travel, and enhances business interaction, it will also provide a speedier conduit for the transfer of cargo. Sri Lanka has been a popular destination among Dutch Travellers, it added, mentioning that 11,987 Dutch tourists have travelled to Sri Lanka in 2022, despite travel restrictions which prevailed during certain periods in the year. Sri Lankas Envoy to the Netherlands Ambassador Aruni Ranaraja and Mr. H. Van Faassen, Acting Director General for Civil Aviation at the Dutch Ministry of Infrastructure and Water Management have signed the instrument on behalf of the two countries, according to the Embassy of Sri Lanka. The signature of the Agreement reflects the mutual desire to further deepen the bilateral relationship, it said. The Agreement signed on February 22, 2023, will come into effect on the first day of the second month following the date of the latter written notification through diplomatic channels, replacing a 1953 instrument, the Embassy of Sri Lanka in the Netherlands highlighted.",

        "date": "February 22, 2023 08:40 pm",
        "content": "While Pakistan grapples with an economic crisis that threatens life as many citizens know it, Indian External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar has implied that India will take a backseat in providing relief to its neighbouring nation, the first time India has responded to the issue there. In an exclusive interview with ANI, Jaishankar said that Indias relationship with Pakistan today is not one where we can be relevant directly in bailing Pakistan from its financial troubles. The nation is suffering from record high inflation, crippling debt, currency depreciation and near bankruptcy. However, thats not all as Pakistan is also embroiled in political crisis and citizens have faced significant power and energy shortages. Referring to all this, Jaishankar believes that Pakistan is answerable for its own disintegration. I think Pakistans future is largely determined by Pakistans actions and by Pakistans choices, Jaishankar said. Nobody reaches a difficult situation suddenly and without cause. The minister added that India would be unable to play a role in aiding its neighbouring nation and that it is for them to find a way out. Jaishankar in his interview referred to Indias assistance to Sri Lanka during their economic crisis and explained that the two nations shared a very different relationship. While India is willing to provide assistance to its neighbours during times of crisis, the case isnt the same with Pakistan as it is with nations like Sri Lanka. With Sri Lanka still there is a lot of goodwill in this country. Theres naturally a neighbours concerns and worry but there is also a feeling that, look, we have to help them to get through this, Jaishankar said. Tomorrow if something happens to some other neighbour, that would be the case as well. But you know what the sentiment in this country is about Pakistan. In May 2022, India had committed more than 3 billion to debt-ridden Sri Lanka in loans, credit lines and credit swipes as the island nation navigated the worst economic crisis it had faced since independence.

        "content": "The Board of Investment of Sri Lanka (BOI) has issued a letter of approval to Indias Adani Green Energy Limited for the two wind power plants to be set up in Mannar and Pooneryn at a total investment of USD 442 million. The project will add 350 MW of electricity to the national grid within two years, the BOI said. Thus, the wind power plant in Mannar will operate at a capacity of 250 MW while the wind power plant in Pooneryn will operate at a capacity of 100 MW. The two wind power plants of 350 MW are scheduled to be commissioned in two years and accordingly, they will be added to the national grid by 2025, the BOI mentioned. Furthermore, the new project will generate 1500-2000 new employment opportunities. Earlier today, Minister of Power and Energy Kanchana Wijesekara had tweeted that the progress of the Renewable energy project of 500 MW in Pooneryn and Mannar was discussed with the visiting Adani Group officials this morning at the Ministry of Power and Energy, with the participation of officials of the Ministry, Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) and Sustainable Energy Authority.",

        "date": "February 22, 2023 09:43 pm",
        "content": "Facing a dire national financial crisis and an urgent need to generate foreign currency income, state-owned SriLankan Airlines (SL) is restructuring and expanding its network to markets that were strong in the pre-Covid period, including Australia, and China. India remains the flag-carriers largest market, though flights have been reduced from 125 to 90 each week. With negligible domestic business, the airline is aggressively tapping the Indian market to fly via Sri Lanka to international destinations. Around 55 to 65 percent of our flights in Airbus A330-300s to Sydney with three dailies and a daily to Melbourne comprise passengers from Bangalore, Hyderabad, Delhi, Mumbai, and several secondary Indian cities, Dimuthu Tennakoon, SLs head of worldwide sales and distribution, told AIN. SL flies to nine destinations in India, which before the pandemic accounted for around 15 percent of revenues, and plans to add three more soon. SL carries significant numbers of passengers to Middle Eastern countries from South India as its fares have been competitive with those of Indian and Gulf carriers. Many of the people on these flights are migrant workers in locations including Qatar and the UAE. The demand from India is so strong and growing, said Tennakoon, as the airline continues to consolidate routes. In its quest for restructuring, SL released a request for proposal for five A320 narrowbodies and five A330s on a six-year dry lease. The bids, which were opened on February 7 and are now under discussion, could add significantly to the present fleet strength of 17 aircraft. Last year, Sri Lankan President Ranil Wickremesinghe, who was then Prime Minister, called for partial privatization of SL and the need for restructuring as it faces payment obligations to suppliers. It has now been almost 15 years since the Sri Lankan government reacquired all the shares in SL from Emirates, which had partially purchased the carrier in 1998. In August, the government said it would sell a 49 percent stake in its catering and ground-handling business units. The State-Owned Enterprises Restructuring Unit is currently working on recommendations for the cabinet. Now, as China reopens its borders, SL is to restart operations in the first week of April with tri-weekly services to Shanghai, Beijing, and Guangzhou. It has also begun offering international flights to Paris; Frankfurt, Germany; Kathmandu, Nepal; and Seoul, Korea. Source  AIN -Agencies",

        "date": "February 23, 2023 08:39 am",
        "content": "Sri Lankan cricketer Danushka Gunathilaka can use the WhatsApp messaging service and go out at night again after having his bail for rape charges varied. Gunathilaka, 31, applied to vary his bail in Sydneys Downing Centre Local Court on Thursday. He is facing four counts of sexual intercourse without consent and has not yet entered a plea. After matching on Tinder, meeting up for a date and heading back to her home in Sydneys eastern suburbs, the complainant alleges the cricketer refused to wear a condom and choked her three times. She cannot be identified. Gunathilaka was banned from using Tinder and other social media platforms when he was granted bail by a magistrate in November 2022. The Crown consented to varying his bail on Thursday so that he can once again use WhatsApp, an encrypted messaging platform owned by Facebook-parent Meta, and popular in his home country. Magistrate Jennifer Atkinson clarified the restrictions on his new freedom to use the platform. Its not to be used for the purposes of facilitating or managing dating, she said. Crown prosecutor George Rixon opposed an application to vary a condition on a night-time curfew, however it was granted by the magistrate. Mr Rixon said the curfew was needed to mitigate the risk of offending based on the alleged facts of the complainants statement, specifically, Gunathilakas aggressive sexual behaviour against her. There are likely to be more opportunities for this alleged offending to occur at night, he said. Ms Atkinson agreed the alleged offending occurred at night. But theres nothing unique about it that it would have occurred at night and couldnt occur during the day, she said. Ms Atkinson said it was going to be more apparent to the public that Gunathilaka had been charged and was on bail due to his high profile. Respectfully, I disagree that this person is necessarily immediately identifiable in the community, Mr Rixon said. Defence barrister Emma Sullivan said media coverage of her clients case has further increased his profile. Hes very well known globally and in Australia, she said. Gunathilaka has been on strict conditions and has been complying with them, Ms Atkinson said, despite Mr Rixons submission that compliance with the orders of the court was not a reason to vary his bail. Im not satisfied today that it is necessary to keep the curfew in place, she said. She warned Gunathilaka he would likely face many months in custody waiting for a trial or sentencing if he breached bail. This needs to be absolute compliance, youve been doing it up until now, she told Gunathilaka. Gunathilaka travelled to Australia with Sri Lankas T20 World Cup team but only played in their first game before being ruled out of the competition with a hamstring tear. He was arrested shortly before boarding a flight home with the rest of the team after it bowed out of the tournament. His case is expected to return to court in April.

        "content": "A large metal sphere that washed up on a shore in Japan has perplexed locals and set off a flurry of speculation. Authorities cant say what it is yet - not even the police or bomb squad sent to investigate. But what is known is that its hollow - and not a threat. Many suspect it to be a type of buoy. The find in coastal city Hamamatsu has been variously dubbed Godzilla egg, mooring buoy and from outer space by fascinated locals. Japanese broadcaster NHK showed footage of two officials on Enshuhama Beach looking at the rusty, metal sphere that appeared about 1.5m (4.9ft) wide. It had been found by a local who alerted police after noticing the unusual object on the shore. Authorities cordoned off the area and conducted X-ray exams which did not reveal much more - other than confirming the object was safe. A runner on the beach told local media he was surprised by the commotion, as the ball had been there for some time. I tried to push it but it wouldnt budge, NHK reported him saying. Local authorities have said the object will be removed soon. This kind of find might not normally raise suspicion - but it comes amid general nervousness over unidentified objects since the US shot down a suspected Chinese spy balloon earlier this month. Japan separately expressed concern to China on Wednesday about suspected surveillance balloons spotted over its skies at least three times since 2019 - an allegation it first made last week. Beijing denies claims of espionage. The two countries defence ministers met on Wednesday, in the first senior bilateral security dialogue in four years. Both sides agreed to work toward launching a communications hotline this spring. Source - BBC -Agencies",

Speaking in Parliament this morning (23 Feb.), Lanza reaffirmed President Ranil Wickremesinghes statement that while the Government has no intention of postponing the LG polls, a legal decision as to whether the election itself will be held is yet to be made. Speaking further on the matter, the MP noted that in order for the election to be held, three officials of the Commission are legally required to place their signatures, which is evidently not yet done. The President has shown that he is acting in accordance with the rules set out in the Constitution of the country. Therefore, there is no point in demanding an election here, because if the Chairman of the Election Commission has acted unlawfully and unconstitutionally, an election cannot be held. So do not shout in here for an election, instead, protest in front of the Election Commission demanding for an election, the MP said, referring to the recent protests staged by Opposition in MPs in the House, demanding that the 2023 polls be held as scheduled. While emphasising that the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) is not against holding the election, Lanza questioned whether it is the right time to hold such an election, given the countrys ongoing crises.",

        "title": "Toyota accepts union demands for biggest wage hike in two decades",
        "date": "February 23, 2023 01:48 pm",
        "content": "Toyota Motor Corp, the worlds biggest automaker, said on Wednesday it would accept a union demand for the biggest base salary increase in 20 years and a rise in bonus payments, as Japan steps up calls for businesses to hike pay. As one of Japans biggest employers, Toyota has long served as a bellwether of the spring labour talks, which are in full swing at major companies. Many are expected to conclude swiftly as the government seeks inflation-beating wage hikes to ease burdens on consumers. The automakers incoming president Koji Sato said the decision to accept the unions demands in full at the first round of talks was meant not just for Toyota but also for the industry as a whole, and in the hope that it will lead to frank discussions between labour and management at each company. Within hours of Toyotas announcement, rival Honda Motor Co Ltd said it had agreed to union demands for a 5 pay increase. The average monthly base salary rise of 12,500 yen (92.70) at Honda is the biggest jump since at least 1990. Toyota and the union federation representing 357,000 Toyota group workers said the base pay rise was the biggest in two decades, though they both declined to provide the percentage increase. With inflation running at around 4 - the highest level in 40 years following decades of deflation - Japan is under more pressure than ever before to raise wages to revive consumption. But with the economy struggling - it averted recession in the fourth quarter but grew much less than expected - analysts say pay increases will remain limited to big firms, such as Toyota. Small and medium-sized companies, which employ most Japanese workers, will struggle to afford pay rises, they say. Toyota said its wage increase would also apply to part-time workers and senior contract workers and it had agreed to unions request for one-off bonus payments worth 6.7 months of wages. Takaaki Sakagami, deputy secretary-general of the Federation of All Toyota Workers Union, said the union was pleased it had been able to reach a deal with the company quickly. The pay agreement comes as Prime Minister Fumio Kishida has stepped up calls on business leaders to accelerate wage increases, warning of a return to stagflation if pay rises fall short of the rapid increase in prices. We will boost consumption and expand domestic demand by promoting efforts toward structural wage increases, Kishida said at a lower house budget committee session on Wednesday. Fast Retailing Co Ltd, which owns clothing giant Uniqlo, last month said it would boost pay by up to 40, fuelling expectations big manufacturers would offer more at annual wage talks with unions this spring. Video game maker Nintendo Co Ltd said earlier this month that it planned to lift workers base pay by 10, despite trimming its full-year profit forecast. Source - Reuters -Agencies",

        "date": "February 23, 2023 02:32 pm",
        "content": "Amidst the ongoing economic crisis, the government has instructed public officials to purchase Economy Class airline tickets for official travels to foreign countries. On the instructions of President Ranil Wickremesinghe, Presidential Secretary Saman Ekanayake issued the directive in a bid to maximize the use of public funds and ensure that resources are utilized efficiently. This directive will take effect from March 01, 2023, and replaces all previous circulars and instructions related to this matter, according to the Presidents Media Division (PMD). As per the new directive, officials such as the Chief Justice, Justices of the Supreme Court, Chairman of the Court of Appeal, and Justices of the Court of Appeal are exempt from booking Economy Class tickets. However, if an officer needs to travel Business Class, they may do so at their own expense, paying the difference between an Economy and Business Class ticket. The directive also states that exceptions to this rule require prior approval, based on sufficient justification. The Presidents directive aims to ensure that government funds are used only for essential purposes and that resources are utilized efficiently, the PMD noted adding that the government can save a significant amount of money while still enabling officials to travel for official purposes by limiting the use of Business Class tickets. All relevant agencies and organizations under the purview of the directive, including Heads of Provincial Ministries, Departments, State Corporations, and Statutory Organizations, have been instructed to comply with the new provisions. Officials are also advised to seek prior approval if they believe they have a sufficient justification for an exception to the rule. This directive comes amidst the current economic and financial challenges facing the country, and it is expected to help alleviate some of the pressure on government funds. It is hoped that by implementing this directive, the government can achieve its goals of financial prudence and efficient resource utilization, the PMD statement said further.",

        "date": "February 23, 2023 02:45 pm",
        "content": "The death toll from the collapse of an open pit coal mine in northern China has risen to four, with 49 people still missing, state broadcaster CCTV reported Thursday. Work had been suspended for several hours after an additional landslide at the gigantic facility following Wednesdays mine collapse in the vast Inner Mongolia regions Alxa League. State media said the landslide struck at 6:00 p.m. Wednesday, about five hours after the initial cave-in of one of the pits walls buried people and mining trucks below. The official Xinhua News Agency said about 900 rescuers with heavy equipment were on the scene and work had resumed by Thursday morning. Chinese President Xi Jinping has demanded all-out efforts in search and rescue and for ensuring the safety of peoples lives and property and maintaining overall social stability. Images of the collapse distributed by CCTV showed a massive wall of debris rushing down a slope onto people and vehicles below. The company running the mine, Inner Mongolia Xinjing Coal Industry Co. Ltd., was cited and fined last year for multiple safety violations ranging from insecure access routes to the mining surface to unsafe storage of volatile materials and a lack of training for its safety overseers, according to the news website The Paper. Inner Mongolia is a key region for mining of coal and various minerals and rare earths, which critics say has ravaged the original landscape of mountains, grassy steppes and deserts. China overwhelmingly relies on coal for power generation but has tried to reduce the number of deadly mine accidents through a greater emphasis on safety and the closure of smaller operations that lacked necessary equipment. Most mining deaths are attributed to explosions caused by the buildup of methane and coal dust, or to drownings caused when miners break into shafts that had been abandoned due to flooding. China has recorded a slew of deadly industrial and construction accidents in recent months as a result of poor safety training and regulation, official corruption and a tendency to cut corners by companies seeking to make profits. The economy has slowed, partly as a result of draconian lockdowns and quarantines imposed under the now-abandoned zero COVID policy. Source - The Associated Press -Agencies",

Mohamed Mafaz Mohideen has said. Sri Lanka seeks to enhance the longstanding ties with Qatar by focusing on untapped potentials in the corporation, Ambassador Mohideen said, addressing a reception held on Tuesday at The Westin Doha Hotel to mark the countrys 75th Independence Day. The event was graced by Minister of Labour H E Dr. Ali bin Smaikh Al Marri; Minister of Social Development and Family H E Maryam bint Ali bin Nasser Al Misnad; and Director of the Protocol Department Ambassador H E Ibrahim Yousif Abdullah Fakhroo. They were joined by members of the Sri Lankan community. Addressing the guests, Ambassador Mohideen said: We have longstanding relationship with Qatar, established in 1976 with ambassadorial level diplomatic relations and reinforced through high level visits and several bilateral agreements. I believe there is much untapped potential in our partnership and cooperation. Therefore, I propose that we take a leap forward in our relationship from a declaration phase to an implementation phase in generating tangible outcomes on the agreements that we have reached with the blessings of our leaders and policy makers, he added. Ambassador Mohideen noted that Sri Lanka is seeking to develop ties in trade and commerce, tourism, education and other areas. On the bilateral front we have seen significant developments this year. Qatar Charity has recommenced their work in Sri Lanka which would provide tangible outcomes benefiting vulnerable and marginalised communities. Discussions are also underway between Ministry of Education in Sri Lanka and Education Above All Foundation in order to provide assistance in the education front, he added. Ambassador Mohideen also added that the Sri Lankan embassy in Doha seeks to establish a Foreign Ministry level consultation committee; organise the third session of the Qatar-Sri Lanka Joint Economy, Commercial and Technical Commission; and create a platform which would act as an umbrella organisation in promoting trade between Qatar and Sri Lanka. He also emphasised on the ongoing economic challenges in Sri Lanka and said that the country has overcome several hardships in the past with resilience, and lauded the support extended by Qatar in overcoming the situation prevailing in Sri Lanka. Similarly, heres my profound belief that showing the same resilience that we as one nation could overcome the economic challenges; synergise in our energies within and outside our country with the assistance and partnership of our true international friends such as Qatar, said Ambassador Mohideen. A short documentary on the diversity and beauty of Sri Lanka was screened, and traditional dance and songs were performed for the guests. Source - The Peninsula -Agencies",

        "date": "February 23, 2023 03:38 pm",
        "content": "U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen stresses that committing to specific and credible financing assurances for Sri Lanka is most urgent. The United States will continue to push for all bilateral official creditors including China to participate in what she called meaningful debt treatment for developing countries and emerging markets in distress, Yellen said joining a press conference at the G20 meeting in Bengaluru. Speaking on tackling building a stronger and more resilient global economy, Yellen noted that it is imperative to work together to ease the debt overhang that is holding back too many countries. The IMF estimates that around 55 percent of low-income countries are close to or in debt distress. Yellen said she looks forward to robust talks later this week about the Common Framework process to help countries like Ghana. The US Treasury Secretary will also be engaging in discussions pertaining to international coordination on debt restructuring for middle-income countries. Yellen was speaking to reporters in the southern Indian city before a two-day G-20 meeting of finance ministers and central bank governors kicks off on Friday. We need to work together to ease the debt overhang that is holding back too many countries, she said. Debt distress is expected to be a hot topic at the meeting, after a year that saw three South Asian countries -- Sri Lanka, Pakistan and Bangladesh -- turn to the International Monetary Fund for help. Yellen noted that the IMF said about 55 of low-income countries are close to or in debt distress. I will continue to push for all bilateral official creditors, including China, to participate in meaningful debt treatments for developing countries and emerging markets in distress, she said. Most urgent, Yellen said, is the need to provide debt treatment to Zambia and to commit to specific and credible financing assurances for Sri Lanka. China last month offered Sri Lanka a moratorium, but its reluctance to provide more significant assurances is seen as a key obstacle hindering Colombos efforts to unlock a 2.9 billion IMF bailout. I will also be discussing international coordination on debt restructuring for middle-income countries, she said, while listing other topics she intends to bring up, including climate change and the evolution of the multilateral development banks. With respect to debt, she was optimistic that China would be constructive and understand the needs of distressed countries. Its important for China to cooperate and come to the table for nations like Sri Lanka and Zambia, she said. The conversations that I have had with my Chinese counterparts have been constructive, she said, and Im hopeful that well see progress in the coming months. --With inputs from agencies",

        "date": "February 24, 2023 10:12 am",
        "content": "Sri Lanka is set to receive its first group of post-pandemic Chinese tourists after becoming one of the first 20 countries to resume the organization of outbound group tourists from China since COVID-19. Their flight will depart from the Shanghai Pudong International Airport on March 3. We are expecting Chinese tourists to come back soon, but their particular interest has been to countries closer to China, Anura Fernando, the consul general of Sri Lanka in Shanghai, said during an interview with China Daily about the countrys eagerness to receive more tourists from China. As soon as the Chinese Ministry of Culture and Tourism announced the decision to allow travel agencies to resume booking groups to travel to 20 countries and regions on Feb 6, the Sri Lanka consul general began to work closely with travel agencies and other partners to reopen direct flights between Shanghai and Colombo, its capital city. With its tropical climate, as well as rich and diverse cultural heritage, Sri Lanka has been a popular destination for holidaymakers from around the world. In 2018, the country received a record number of 280,000 tourists from China. Since most Chinese havent traveled out of the country for three years, they are looking at closer destinations, he says, adding but I think Sri Lanka should be attractive to most Chinese tourists. He notes that the rich heritage of Buddhist culture, tea plantations, gem stones, as well as its natural beauty and water activities, are all appealing for Chinese tourists. Now that the pandemic is over, and Sri Lanka has emerged from the economic crisis, Fernando hopes that this year tourists numbers will increase to about 1 million. China is the biggest trading partner of Sri Lanka and the largest source of foreign investments. With the signing of a free trade agreement expected to be made this year, Fernando believes the trade volume will increase between the two countries. One of the first countries involved in Chinas Belt and Road Initiative, Sri Lanka has witnessed major projects constructed by China, such as the Port City in Colombo that kicked off in 2014. The construction process was slowed down because of the pandemic, and now that the Chinese workers are returning, he says the construction has restarted, with a new international financial center expected to be completed in the coming two years when it will start functioning. Sri Lanka has a large Chinese community so Chinese tourists are very much at home, with Chinese restaurants and Chinese-speaking tour guides. We have a lot of cultural bonding, Fernando says. As much as we need the foreign currency, we also need more friendship with the Chinese people. From the Bandaranaike Memorial International Conference Hall in 1973, to the Lotus Tower unveiled in 2019, China has helped construct monumental structures in Sri Lanka, which are evidence of the close ties between the two countries. This year marks the 20th anniversary of sister cities ties between Shanghai and Colombo, and the consul general hopes more cultural, tourism and business communication could enhance the friendship between Chinese and Sri Lankan people.

        "content": "World Food Programme (WFP), in its Country Brief for January 2023, notes that food insecurity remains at concerning levels in the face of Sri Lankas economic crisis. However, as per the latest Household Food Security Survey for December 2022, 33 of households in Sri Lanka are food insecure, a decline from 37 in November, the document read further. The organization says 68 of households are resorting to negative food-based coping strategies such as consuming less preferred food, limiting portion sizes andor reducing the number of meals. The WFP says, in tandem with the Sri Lankan government, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN and WFP, a joint Food Security Assessment (CFSAM) would be conducted in early March, targeting 15,000 households from 25 districts. This is a follow-up to the CFSAM conducted in May 2022. The report further noted that markets remain functional and currently have a wide range of products, adequate physical availability of essential goods and a resilient supply chain, despite the markets reporting concerns around price volatility in December last year as per the WFPs December Market Functional Index. With regards to its emergency responses to Sri Lankas economic crisis, WFP mentioned its plans to assist 3.4 million people through general food distribution, school meals and nutrition support. Since the start of emergency operations in June 2022, WFP has reached 489,040 people with cash assistance and 362,100 with in-kind food assistance. This is a result of WFPs response scale-up aimed at reaching 1.4 million people through unconditional food assistance (cash or in-kind). As of January 2023, WFP had distributed rice to 7,593 schools, reaching 1,050,714 children. WFP surpassed its plan to support 1 million children with school meals through the Governments national school meals programme in 2022.",

Furthermore, the COAP chair pointed out that the Committee on Public Accounts, being the oldest committee in the history of parliament, will complete 100 years in October 2023.

        "date": "February 24, 2023 02:24 pm",
        "content": "The United Nations overwhelmingly isolated Russia on Thursday, marking one year since Moscow invaded Ukraine by calling for a comprehensive, just and lasting peace and again demanding Moscow withdraw its troops and stop fighting. Just a day after Chinas top diplomat visited Moscow and pledged a deeper partnership with Russia, Beijing abstained on the vote - the fourth time it has done so on such action since Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24 last year. With a round of applause, the resolution was adopted on Thursday with 141 votes in favor and 32 abstentions. Six countries joined Russia to vote no - Belarus, North Korea, Eritrea, Mali, Nicaragua and Syria. This resolution is a powerful signal of unflagging global support for Ukraine, Ukraines President Volodymyr Zelenskiy posted on Twitter after the vote. Russias Deputy U.N. Ambassador Dmitry Polyanskiy dismissed the action at the United Nations as useless, posting on Twitter: Will it bring peace? No! Will it embolden warmongers? Yes! Thus prolonging Ukrainian tragedy. Russia had described the resolution as unbalanced and anti-Russian and urged countries to vote no if it could not be amended. Moscow ally Belarus failed in a bid to change the text with amendments including prevention of further escalation of the conflict through feeding the parties with lethal weapons. Western powers have provided Ukraine with billions of dollars in weapons since Russia invaded. The United States and NATO have in the past week accused China of considering supplying arms to Russia and warned Beijing against such a move. One year into the Ukraine crisis brutal facts offer an ample proof that sending weapons will not bring peace, Chinas deputy U.N. Ambassador Dai Bing said ahead of the vote. Adding fuel to the fire will only exacerbate tensions. Chinas abstentions appear to reflect a bid to stay on the diplomatic fence over the war in Ukraine. Beijing says the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries must be respected, but - in a nod to Russias unease about NATO - believes all security concerns should be addressed. VENEER OF NEUTRALITY China did vote against two resolutions adopted by the U.N. General Assembly last year that took specific action - suspending Russia from the Human Rights Council and recognizing Russia must be responsible for making reparations to Ukraine. China attempts to maintain this veneer of neutrality, professing to the world that theyre not taking a side - but theyve clearly chosen a side, U.S. State Department spokesperson Ned Price said on Thursday. He said China has been providing important support to Russia over the course of the last year, citing non-lethal assistance provided by Chinese companies tied to the state. Moscow has been trying to chip away at its international isolation. As Russia and the West have vied for diplomatic influence, some states - particularly in the global South - have grown concerned about paying the price for being squeezed in the middle of an intense geopolitical rivalry. While we support the present resolutions focus on the principles of the charter and international law, it certainly brings us no closer to laying the foundations for a durable peace and bringing and end to devastation and destruction, said South Africas U.N. Ambassador Mathu Joyini, who abstained. Brazil voted for the resolution, but its Ambassador Ronaldo Costa Filho said the time has come to open space for dialogue and to begin reconstruction. The General Assembly has been the focus for U.N. action on Ukraine, with the 15-member Security Council paralyzed due to veto power by Russia and the United States along with China, France and Britain. The Security Council has held dozens of meetings on Ukraine in the past year and will again discuss the war on Friday at a ministerial gathering, due to be attended by U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken. Diplomats say Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov is not scheduled to attend. Source: Reuters -Agencies",

        "content": "The United States and China will hold deputy-level talks between their finance officials on Friday to discuss debt and other issues on the sidelines of a G20 finance meet in India, two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters. U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said on Thursday, ahead of a meeting of G20 finance ministers and central bank governors near Bengaluru, that communication between the United States and China was important for the sake of the entire globe. One of the sources, both of whom declined to be named as they were not authorised to talk to the media, said a range of multilateral issues would be discussed at the Friday meeting, including debt. A U.S. Treasury spokesperson declined to comment when asked about the planned meeting. Chinas Ministry of Finance and its central bank did not immediately respond to a request seeking comment. The United States has repeatedly criticised China over what it considers to be foot-dragging on debt relief for dozens of low-and middle-income countries including Sri Lanka. China, the worlds largest bilateral creditor, urged G20 nations on Friday to conduct a fair, objective and in-depth analysis of the causes of global debt issues and to resolve the problem in a comprehensive and effective manner.

        "title": "Sri Lankan-born Prof. Antony Anghie honoured for stellar contributions to international law",
        "date": "February 24, 2023 10:28 pm",
        "content": "Sri Lankan-born, Harvard-educated Professor Antony Anghie has been conferred the prestigious Manley O. Hudson Medal by the American Society of International Law (ASIL) for his exceptional contributions to scholarship and achievement in international law. Taking to Twitter, Ambassador of the United States to Sri Lanka Julie Chung congratulated Prof. Anghie on his accomplishment. Lawyers and their commitment to rule of law support the democratic process, she said further in her tweet. Born in Sri Lanka and an intellectual heavyweight in the field of international law, Prof. Anghie is only the second Asian to receive this prestigious accolade. The Law professor at the National University of Singapore (NSU) joins the ranks of legal luminaries who have received the award such as Judge Stephen Breyer, former Associate Justice of the US Supreme Court; Sir Robert Jennings and Dame Rosalyn Higgins, former Presidents of the International Court of Justice; renowned transnational law academic Prof Philip C. Jessup; and pioneering human rights scholar Prof Louis Henkin. Prof. Anghie is a pioneering and leading authority on Third World Approaches to International Law (TWAIL)  an important field of scholarship which studies the inequalities of the international legal order. His work argues that the peoples of the Global South have been historically and systematically excluded from international law-making, resulting in ongoing inequality and justice. A cornerstone of his research is his highly influential book Imperialism, Sovereignty, and the Making of International Law which examines the relationship between colonialism and international law. His groundbreaking work has allowed younger generations of scholars to address the enduring legacies of colonialism and imperialism. Prof. Anghie said, This is a very unexpected honour because my arguments were viewed as radical and challenging at the time I first made them. It was a struggle to get my book published. But I was fortunate to be able to take time over my scholarship. Congratulating Prof. Anghie, NUS Law Dean and Professor of Law Andrew Simester said, The Manley O. Hudson Award is a major honour, one that recognises Tonys unwavering commitment and outstanding contribution to international law. Tony is unquestionably one of the finest academics globally in his fieldThe American Society of International Law has honoured a lifetime of achievement, and NUS Law is very fortunate to have Tony as one of our colleagues, Prof Simester added. Based at NUS Law for the past six years, Prof. Anghie has taught a variety of courses in the Public International Law curriculum, including Current Problems in International Law, Developing States in a Changing World Order, and International Economic Law and Globalisation. In addition, he is Head of the Teaching and Researching International Law in Asia Programme at the NUS Centre for International Law. Prof. Anghie practised law in Melbourne, Australia after qualifying as a Barrister and Solicitor of the Supreme Court of Victoria. He then earned his Doctor of Juridical Science degree from the Harvard Law School, where he was appointed Senior Fellow in its graduate programme. He still teaches at the S.J. Quinney School of Law, University of Utah, where he previously served as the Samuel D. Thurman Professor of Law, and he was also a visiting professor at distinguished schools including Cornell Law School, the London School of Economics and Harvard Law School. The law academics most recent published work is an essay on the concept of security in international law titled Introduction to the Symposium on J. Benton Heath, Making Sense of Security published in the American Journal of International Law. Prof. Anghie is now working on the history of the rights of aliens  which explores how developments in that field are related to the emergence of international human rights law. -with inputs from NSU",

        "title": "Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein gets 16 more years for rape, sexual assault",
        "date": "February 25, 2023 07:02 am",
        "content": "A Los Angeles judge on Thursday sentenced Harvey Weinstein to 16 more years in prison after a jury convicted him of the rape and sexual assault of an Italian actor and model, furthering the fall of the onetime movie magnate who became a MeToo magnet. The prison term, along with the 23 years he received in 2020 for a similar conviction in New York, amounts to a likely life sentence for the 70-year-old. Weinstein, sitting in a wheelchair and wearing jail attire, directly appealed to Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Lisa B. Lench, saying: I maintain that Im innocent. I never raped or sexually assaulted Jane Doe 1.  The woman who Weinstein was convicted of raping sobbed in the courtroom as he spoke. Moments earlier she had told the judge about the pain she felt after being attacked by Weinstein. Before that night I was a very happy and confident woman. I valued myself and the relationship I had with God, the woman, who was identified in court only as Jane Doe 1, said through tears as she stood at a lectern behind prosecutors. I was excited about my future. Everything changed after the defendant brutally assaulted me. There is no prison sentence long enough to undo the damage. Jurors in December convicted Weinstein of one count of rape and two counts of sexual assault against the woman who at the trials opening in October gave a dramatic and emotional account of him arriving uninvited at her hotel room during a 2013 film festival in the run-up to the Oscars, talking his way in and assaulting her during a film festival. Lench sentenced Weinstein to eight years for a forcible rape count, six years for forcible oral copulation and two years for forcible penetration with a foreign object, for a combined 16 years. His attorneys requested that she sentence him to three years for each count, and have the sentences run simultaneously. Mr. Weinstein did a lot of good for a lot of people in a 50 year career,  Weinstein lawyer Mark Werksman told the judge. He was a man that many famous movie stars would thank in their Oscar speeches. Werksman cited Weinsteins age and very poor health, suggesting a long sentence would make it unlikely he would ever see his five children outside of prison. Jane Doe 1 could be heard crying in court throughout Werksman and Weinsteins remarks to the judge. This is a made up story. Jane Doe 1 is an actress. She can turn the tears on, said Weinstein, who insisted he had never met the woman. Please dont sentence me to life in prison. I dont deserve it. There are so many things wrong with this case. The jury acquitted Weinstein of the sexual battery of a massage therapist and failed to reach verdicts on counts involving two other women. Today, justice prevailed for survivors, the massage therapist, known during trial as Jane Doe 3, said in a statement issued through her attorney after the sentencing. No woman has to fear Harvey Weinstein again as he will never leave prison. The defense contends that Weinstein had consensual sex with two of the women he was charged with assaulting and that two others were making up the incidents entirely. Lench handed down the sentence Thursday after rejecting a motion by Weinsteins lawyers for a new trial. In arguments they said the judge was wrong to exclude from evidence messages showing that the Italian model had a sexual relationship with the director of the film festival she was visiting during the attack. Defense attorney Alan Jackson said that rape shield laws excluding the sexual history of a victim were not relevant here, because the defense would have used the messages to show that the woman perjured herself and damaged her credibility when she testified that she and the festival director, Pascal Videcomini, were merely friends and colleagues. If the jury had known that Jane Doe 1 and Pascal were intimately involved, they never would have bought the story that was told, Jackson said. We know they wouldnt have bought it. Because some of them have said so. Jackson argued that the messages would also have bolstered defense arguments that the woman was not even in her hotel room, where she testified the attack occurred, but was with Vicedomini. The defense had given the judge affidavits from jurors, two of whom were in the audience for the sentencing, that the evidence might have made them decide differently. Lench called the juror statements speculation about how the evidence would have played out that were not relevant under the law. The two jurors, who only gave their first names Michael and Jay, told reporters outside the courtroom that they were not there to advocate for either side, but said hearing about the messages might have changed deliberations. The issue is likely to be at the forefront of Weinsteins upcoming appeal. Prosecutors and Weinsteins attorneys declined comment on the sentence. The Associated Press does not typically name people who say they have been sexually assaulted. Legal uncertainties remain on both coasts for Weinstein. New Yorks highest court has agreed to hear his appeal in his rape and sexual assault convictions there. And prosecutors in Los Angeles have yet to say whether they will retry Weinstein on counts they were unable to reach a verdict on. A hearing on the possible retrial is scheduled for next month. Weinstein is eligible for parole in New York in 2039. Source: Associated Press (AP) -Agencies",

        "date": "February 25, 2023 08:09 am",
        "content": "A rift is observed in the main opposition Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) as MP Harsha de Silva takes issue with fellow SJB parliamentarian Mayantha Dissanayake accepting the position of Committee on Public Finance (COPF) chair. Speaking to the media in this regard, MP de Silva, who cried foul over the appointment, alleged that this happened with the full knowledge of President Ranil Wickremesinghe. On Thursday (Feb 23), MP Dissanayake was picked as the COPF chair despite MP de Silva being proposed by the SJB for the position. After the third session of the ninth parliament was prorogued by President Wickremesinghe, three parliamentary watchdog committees, namely the Committee on Public Accounts (COPA), Committee on Public Enterprises (COPE) and the COPF, were accordingly dissolved. Following the appointment of MP Dissanayake as the COPF chair, MP de Silva alleged that all government MPs in the Committee of Selection in the parliament endorsed this appointment, overruling his nomination. Actually, it was my name that was proposed by the opposition as the nominee from the opposition. It was approved two days ago. But today, the government abused their power and used Mayantha to get their way, the SJB lawmaker tweeted on Thursday. MP de Silva later mentioned that Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa has asked MP Dissanayake to step down as the COPF chair, who refused to do so. Meanwhile, a heated debate ensued in the parliament on Friday (Feb 24) over the matter. According to Sri Lanka Muslim Congress (SLMC) leader MP Rauff Hakeem, who is also a member of the Committee of Selection, stated that the new COPF chair has mentioned that he was asked by Speaker of Parliament Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena to accept the position. However, the Speaker was quick to refuse the claim, stating that it was MP Dissanayake who telephoned him. Hakeem noted that, in terms of the Standing Orders, the selection committee should accept the name of the parliamentarian proposed by the opposition as the COPF chair. Pursuant to the Standing Orders of the parliament, a member of the opposition should be appointed for the COPF chairmanship. However, MPs in the ruling party insist that the Committee of Selection has made the appointment in compliance with the Standing Orders.",
