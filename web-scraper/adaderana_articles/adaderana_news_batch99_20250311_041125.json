It is understood that Jayasekara has forwarded his letter of resignation to the Speaker of Parliament Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena. His resignation came a day after Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) MP Eran Wickramaratne resigned from his position as a COPE member. In his resignation letter, Wickramaratne explained that no credible action had been taken on those who were found to have been complicit in corrupt practices or mismanagement despite the COPE reports submitted to the parliament time and time again. He also took issue with the appointment of Rohitha Abeygunawardena, a ruling party MP, as the COPE chairman despite the previous government adopting a practice of appointing an Opposition member to chair the committee to strengthen the principle that the legislature must be a check and balance on the executive arm of government. In addition, Wickramaratne highlighted that it is dissatisfying that members who have been appointed to COPE have allegations against their personal conduct, particularly on financial transactions and that this also contributes to the citizens loss of confidence in Parliament.",

At least 4,000 containers are reportedly held up at the Colombo Port as a result of the trade union action launched by the employees of Sri Lanka Customs on Friday (March 15). Initially, the Customs officials including superintendents and staff officers boycotted working extra hours, however, they resorted to a strict work-to-rule campaign at 9 a.m. today (March 19) it is expected to go on until 4.45 p.m. Calling a media briefing, the chairman of the Customs Officers Union Amila Sanjeewa attributed the reason behind the trade union action to the Treasurys decision to bring the Customs Officers Reward Fund under the purview of the Finance Ministry. Against this backdrop, the president of the Container Transport Owners Association, Sanath Manjula warned that the importers are likely to be afflicted if the situation prevails. He also emphasized that manufacturers would face difficulties without being able to get their hands on the raw materials required for production. In addition, only a limited amount of essential food items and medicine are being cleared by the Customs officials, Mr. Manjula pointed out further.",

        "date": "March 19, 2024 04:21 pm",
        "content": "Nvidia has unveiled its latest artificial intelligence (AI) chip which it says can do some tasks 30 times faster than its predecessor. The firm has an 80 market share and hopes to cement its dominance. In addition to the B200 Blackwell chip, its chief executive Jensen Huang detailed a new set of software tools at its annual developer conference. Nvidia is the third-most valuable company in the US, behind only Microsoft and Apple. Its shares have surged 240 over the past year and its market value touched 2tn (1.57tn) last month. As Mr Huang kicked off the conference, he jokingly said, I hope you realise this is not a concert. But Bob ODonnell from Technalysis Research who was at the event told the BBC that the buzz was in the air. I havent seen something like this in the tech industry in quite some time, he said. In fact, some people were making analogies to the early days of Steve Jobs types of presentations. Nvidia said major customers including Amazon, Google, Microsoft and OpenAI are expected to use the firms new flagship chip in cloud-computing services and for their own AI offerings. It also said the new software tools, called microservices, improve system efficiency to make it easier for a business to incorporate an AI model into its work. Other announcements include a new line of chips for cars which can run chatbots inside the vehicle. The company said Chinese electric vehicle makers BYD and Xpeng would both use its new chips. Mr Huang also outlined a new series of chips for creating humanoid robots, inviting several of the robots to join him on the stage. Founded in 1993, Nvidia was originally known for making the type of computer chips that process graphics, particularly for computer games. Long before the AI revolution, it started adding features to its chips that it says help machine learning, investments that have helped it gain market share. It is now seen as a key company to watch to see how fast AI-powered tech is spreading across the business world. But competition is heating up from rivals such as AMD and Intel. Mr ODonnell said the market was growing so quickly that even if Nvidia loses some share, they can still grow their overall business because theres just a lot of opportunities for everybody.

        "date": "March 19, 2024 09:10 pm",
        "content": "Sri Lanka all-rounder Wanindu Hasaranga has been suspended for Bangladeshs two-Test series against Bangladesh, shortly after announcing his decision to return to Test cricket having retired from the format last year. During the third ODI in the recently-concluded series against Bangladesh, Hasaranga was found guilty of breaching article 2.8 of the ICC Code of Conduct for Players and Player Support Personnel, which relates to showing dissent at an Umpires decision during an International Match. The incident occurred in the 37th over of the game when Hasaranga snatched his cap from one of the umpires and ridiculed the umpiring in the match. Bangladesh took the series 2-1 after winning the contest by four wickets. He received a 50 per cent fine and accumulated three demerit points for his offense. This brought his total demerit points to eight in a 24-month period. The all-rounder was already on five demerit points after receiving three demerit points in the third T20I against Afghanistan in Dambulla last month. Following this, he was suspended for two T20Is against Bangladesh. Now, with the addition of the latest demerit points, he has breached the threshold of eight demerit points, which, pursuant to article 7.6 of the Code, have been converted into four suspension points. The four suspension points equate to a ban from two Tests or four ODIs or T20Is, whatever comes first  Hasaranga will therefore miss the two ICC World Test Championship Tests against Bangladesh. Sri Lanka ODI skipper Kusal Mendis also copped a 50 per cent fine and three demerit points for a Level 2 offence after he abused the umpires while shaking hands with them at the end of the third match. This breached article 2.13 of the Code, which relates to Personal abuse of a Player, Player Support Personnel, Umpire or Match Referee during an International Match. This was a first offence for Mendis in a 24-month period. Both Hasaranga and Mendis admitted their offences and accepted the sanctions proposed by Andy Pycroft of the Emirates ICC Elite Panel of Match Referees. --ICC",

        "date": "March 19, 2024 11:13 pm",
        "content": "The World Bank has hailed Sri Lankas toll-free 1990 Suwa Seriya ambulance service for saving countless lives, while providing citizens the highest level of pre-hospital care. In a blog post, the World Banks Vice President for the South Asia Region, Martin Raiser further commended the ambulance service for reducing complications caused by delayed care, and enabling them to get back into the workforce in record timemaking a positive contribution to the countrys economy. Since its launch in 2016, 1.8 million Sri Lankan citizens in distress have dialed 1990, and a Suwa Seriya ambulance has rushed them to the nearest hospital or primary care facility within 12 minutes of their call, one of the fastest response rates in the world for an ambulance service. South Asia is home to many development innovations, including in the delivery of social services through government-private sector-and civil society partnerships, Raiser said, noting that 1990 Suwa Seriya stands in a proud tradition. The 1990 Suwa Seriya, one of the worlds most digitally advanced and free ambulance services, was established through a dedicated Act of Parliament in 2018. It is a government entity that operates with the agility and independence of a private sector organization, resulting in remarkable efficiency and setting new standards for government-delivered services. The World Banks senior official lauded Suwa Seriya for tapping into digitization by leading digital innovation in health and emergency services. Its trademark speed and efficiency come from digital integration into its processes and operationsfrom using specific algorithms to identify the fastest (not the nearest) ambulance that can be deployed to an emergency, to tracking callers locations through an app, to digitally tracking fuel levels in its vehicles. A new ambitious pilot initiative called Connected Ambulance takes digital health to new heights by incorporating Artificial Intelligence and Mixed Reality to allow physicians to treat a patient in real time on board an ambulance. Raiser emphasized that Suwa Seriyas success is an example of how technology can help revolutionize service delivery in developing countries. He said Suwa Seriya is strengthening Sri Lankas primary healthcare system and giving a second chance at life to the millions who are critically injured by filling a critical gap in pre-hospital care and improving connectivity between emergency ambulance service and primary care facilities. The ambulance service also complements the work done by the World Bank-financed Primary Healthcare Strengthening Project to enhance Sri Lankas primary healthcare services, he further commented. Raiser pointed out that the ambulance service was particularly indispensable during the COVID-19 pandemic, with Suwa Seriya transporting close to 175,000 COVID-19 patients to the hospital. In addition, it has also improved healthcare access in hard-to-reach rural areas such as in Ramyas case above, ensuring equitable access of emergency services to vulnerable citizens, and reducing overall morbidity and mortality in the country, he continued. The Vice President is of the view that the growth of Suwa Seriya is a testament to homegrown innovation and local funding. The technology that drives the service was all developed through Sri Lankas software development community, underscoring the need for countries to invest in digital skills. Initially funded by a grant from India, 1990 Suwa Seriya has since been supported by the Sri Lankan government. However, it deliberately seeks private donors and sponsors to fund its digital innovations so as to not rely solely on public funding in a resource-constrained environment. In its largest fundraiser yet, Suwa Seriya raised an impressive LKR 750 million in private funding via its adopt an ambulance campaign. In conclusion, Raiser said: South Asia has been hard hit by several shocks in recent years, from devastating natural disasters and economic crises to pandemics and political upheavals. However, initiatives like 1990 Suwa Seriya show that countries can be resilient and innovative even during crises, displaying homegrown creative solutioning at its best and how it can be replicated and expanded to create widespread benefits for the entire population.",

        "date": "March 20, 2024 08:00 am",
        "content": "(Reuters) - Every major global climate record was broken last year and 2024 could be worse, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) said on Tuesday, with its chief voicing particular concern about ocean heat and shrinking sea ice. The U.N. weather agency said in its annual State of the Global Climate report that average temperatures hit the highest level in 174 years of record-keeping by a clear margin, reaching 1.45 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. Ocean temperatures also reached the warmest in 65 years of data with over 90 of the seas having experienced heatwave conditions during the year, the WMO said, harming food systems. The WMO community is sounding the Red Alert to the world, said WMO Secretary-General Celeste Saulo, who took over the job in January. What we witnessed in 2023, especially with the unprecedented ocean warmth, glacier retreat and Antarctic sea ice loss, is cause for particular concern. She later told reporters that ocean heat was particularly concerning because it was almost irreversible, possibly taking millennia to reverse. The trend is really very worrying and that is because of the characteristics of water that keep heat content for longer than the atmosphere, she said. Climate change, driven by the burning of fossil fuels, coupled with the emergence of the natural El Nino climate pattern, pushed the world into record territory in 2023. WMOs head of climate monitoring, Omar Baddour, told reporters there was a high probability that 2024 would set new heat records, saying that the year after an El Nino was typically warmer still. Tuesdays report showed a big plunge in Antarctic sea ice, with the peak level measured at 1 million km2 below the previous record - an area roughly equivalent to the size of Egypt. That trend, combined with ocean warming which causes water to expand, has contributed to a more than doubling of the rate of sea-level rise over the past decade compared with the 1993-2002 period, it said. Ocean heat was concentrated in the North Atlantic with temperatures an average 3 degrees Celsius above average in late 2023, the report said. Warmer ocean temperatures affect delicate marine ecosystems and many fish species have fled north from this area seeking cooler temperatures. Saulo, a meteorologist from Argentina who has promised to strengthen global warning systems for climate disasters, said she hoped the report would raise awareness of the vital need to scale up the urgency and ambition of climate action. Thats why we spoke about the Red Alert because we must care for the people and how they will suffer from these more frequent, more extreme events, she told reporters. If we do nothing, things will become worse and that will be our responsibility. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "date": "March 20, 2024 10:47 am",
        "content": "The elections are likely to get postponed if the proposals put forward to amend the parliamentary electoral system are not properly implemented, the Peoples Action for Free and Fair Elections (PAFFREL) has said, raising concerns about the Cabinet of Ministers green-lighting a proposal in this regard. Acknowledging the need to revise the countrys electoral system, the executive director of the election watchdog Rohana Hettiarachchi, however, highlighted the importance of finalizing the delimitation process before any changes are to be made to the parliamentary electoral system. But if the delimitation process is not concluded even if the electoral system is revised by August, it is imperative that this draft bill incorporates an amendment that allows the Election Commission to conduct the polls pursuant to the existing electoral system, he added. Hettiarachchi also referred to the past instances where the local government and provincial council elections were compelled to be postponed as a result of the delays in finalizing the delimitation process. As per a recent Cabinet decision, necessary laws are to be drafted to amend the electoral system to elect 160 MPs directly from the voters of the respective constituencies, also known as the First-Past-the-Post (FPTP) system, and for the remaining 65 MPs to be elected according to the proportional voting system at the national or provincial level. The government said the need to revise the current electoral system was identified in order to meet the objectives of the Election Expenses Regulation Act No. 3 of 2023 and to achieve a fully democratic election. Accordingly, a Cabinet sub-committee was appointed to ask the views of all party leaders and other relevant parties representing the Parliament and submit a report to the Cabinet with relevant recommendations. Suggestions have been presented to the committee to elect 160 MPs directly from the voters of the respective constituencies and the remaining 65 MPs to be elected at the national or provincial level according to the proportional voting system and the agreement of the majority has been received for this, the government said further. The proposal had been tabled by Minister of Justice, Prison Affairs and Constitutional Reform Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe.",

        "date": "March 20, 2024 11:45 am",
        "content": "The Governor of the Eastern Province, Senthil Thondaman says the debt crisis of the country can be resolved by successfully executing the development projects outlined for the region under the guidance of President Ranil Wickremesinghe. As the President is the only leader capable of reconstructing the nation, it is incumbent upon all parties to rally behind him and offer their support, Thondaman further commented. The Eastern Province Governor made these remarks during a press briefing titled Collective Path to a Stable Country held at the President Media Centre (PMC) on Tuesday (March 19). Governor Thondaman further elaborated on the matter: Following the instructions of President Ranil Wickremesinghe, weve initiated numerous development projects in the Eastern Province, with several more slated to begin soon. The province, having endured the effects of a thirty-year-long war, faced developmental setbacks relative to other regions in the country. As a result, I have been directed by the President to prioritize the development of the three districts within this province. Numerous projects are being devised and executed based on the guidance of President Ranil Wickremesinghe, aiming to establish the Eastern Province as the leading economic contributor among the countrys provinces. We have acknowledged the significant development potential present in the Eastern Province. Notably, areas such as shrimp farming, mineral resources, ports, airports, water resources, tourism, agricultural modernization, and land development stand out as key sectors with promising prospects. Furthermore, considering the abundant resources in the Eastern Province, it is crucial to manage them efficiently for developmental endeavours. I anticipate financial support from international financial institutions to aid in this effort. It is worth noting that the successful implementation of the development projects as directed by the President in the Eastern Province will suffice to address the nations debt crisis. President Ranil Wickremesinghe has directed attention to the salary concerns of the hill country communities, emphasizing the importance of fair wages for plantation workers. Negotiations are underway with estate companies regarding salary increments, which are typically reviewed every two years. The issue has been brought before the Wages Board, with input received from estate companies. Additionally, efforts are being made to link the plantation industry with foreign exchange, ensuring that salary adjustments align with the local cost of living in response to fluctuations in the dollars value. Its essential to acknowledge that, I believe President Ranil Wickremesinghe is the only leader capable of leading our country out of the economic crisis. During his tenure, President Wickremesinghe secured support from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), leading to our countrys swift restoration within a few months. I firmly believe that regardless of who holds the presidency in the future, the conditions set by the IMF cannot be altered. Its evident from the experiences of countries that did not receive IMF support during their economic crises that they have struggled to recover fully. Hence, as President Ranil Wickremesinghe stands as the only leader capable of rebuilding the country, it is essential to underscore that it is the obligation of all parties to lend their support to him. --PMD",

As expected, Finland topped the list for the seventh year in a row, followed by Denmark, Iceland and Sweden. Israel too made it to the top five of the ranking. Meanwhile, Afghanistan was deemed the least happy country, after Congo, Sierra Leone, Lesotho and Lebanon. The United States fell in ranking from the 16th spot last year to the 23rd spot this year. This year, Canada took the 15th spot while the UK was at the 20, Germany at 24 and France at 27. Among Middle Eastern nations, the UAE was ranked 22 and Saudi Arabia 28. Among Asian nations, Singapore was at 30, Japan at 50 and South Korea at 51. India ranked 126th while China ranked 60th, Nepal at 93, Pakistan at 108, Myanmar at 118, Sri Lanka at 128 and Bangladesh at 129th spots. Sri Lankas ranking dropped by one position since 2022. The report observed that in India, older age is associated with higher life satisfaction. However, older Indian women reported lower life satisfaction than older men, it added. Education and caste played key roles, with older adults with secondary or higher education and those of higher social castes reporting higher life satisfaction than their counterparts without formal education and those from scheduled castes and scheduled tribes, it said. Worldwide, women were less happy than men in every region, with the gender gap widening as they aged, said the report. While ranking happiness in young people (aged 30 and below), Lithuania, Israel, Serbia, Iceland and Denmark ranked in the top five slots, with Finland being delegated to the seventh rank. India ranked at 127th spot in this. However, when it came to ranking happiness in old people (aged 60 and above), Denmark, Finland, Norway, Sweden and Iceland  all Nordic nations  ranked the highest, with India occupying the 121st spot. Countries ranking highest for the old are generally countries with high overall rankings, but include several where the young have recently fared very poorly, the report observed. The World Happiness Report is published annually by the United Nations Sustainable Development Solutions Network and takes into account six variables  GDP per capita, healthy life expectancy, having someone to count on, freedom to make life choices, generosity, and freedom from corruption.

He said it was pointed out that the government has taken steps to increase the number of tax files, which had decreased due to various policy decisions, to approximately one million at present. Meanwhile, the State Minister of Finance has also held a discussion with the Deputy Chief Economist at the UKs Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office, Dr Fergus Cumming, and the British High Commissioner to Sri Lanka, Andrew Patrick. He said the discussion delved into various aspects of current economic trends, exploring their implications and identifying emerging challenges and opportunities, particularly in the context of post-crisis recovery efforts. Additionally, he said they examined the outcomes of the IMF programme and discussed reforms extending beyond the programmes scope. The emphasis was placed on the significance of maintaining momentum with reforms, he said in a post on X.

        "date": "March 20, 2024 02:40 pm",
        "content": "Scientists say they have successfully eliminated HIV from infected cells, using Nobel Prize-winning Crispr gene-editing technology. Working like scissors, but at the molecular level, it cuts DNA so bad bits can be removed or inactivated. The hope is to ultimately be able to rid the body entirely of the virus, although much more work is needed to check it would be safe and effective. Existing HIV medicines can stop the virus but not eliminate it. The University of Amsterdam team, presenting a synopsis, or abstract, of their early findings at a medical conference this week, stress their work remains merely proof of concept and will not become a cure for HIV any time soon. And Dr James Dixon, stem-cell and gene-therapy technologies associate professor at the University of Nottingham, agrees, saying the full findings still require scrutiny. Much more work will be needed to demonstrate results in these cell assays can happen in an entire body for a future therapy, he said. There will be much more development needed before this could have impact on those with HIV. Extremely challenging Other scientists are also trying to use Crispr against HIV. And Excision BioTherapeutics says after 48 weeks, three volunteers with HIV have no serious side effects. But Dr Jonathan Stoye, a virus expert at the Francis Crick Institute, in London, said removing HIV from all the cells that might harbour it in the body was extremely challenging. Off-target effects of the treatment, with possible long-term side effects, remain a concern, he said. It therefore seems likely that many years will elapse before any such Crispr-based therapy becomes routine - even assuming that it can be shown to be effective. HIV infects and attacks immune-system cells, using their own machinery to make copies of itself. Even with effective treatment, some go into a resting, or latent, state - so they still contain the DNA, or genetic material, of HIV, even if not actively producing new virus. Most people with HIV need life-long antiretroviral therapy. If they stop taking these drugs, the dormant virus can reawaken and cause problems again. A rare few have been apparently cured, after aggressive cancer therapy wiped out some of their infected cells, but this would never be recommended purely to treat HIV. Source: BBC -Agencies",

        "date": "March 20, 2024 04:22 pm",
        "content": "The name may be Bond, James Bond, but the name of who is playing the iconic spy next remains elusive. Thanks to a report in U.K. tabloid publication The Sun, Kraven the Hunter star Aaron Taylor-Johnson is the latest name under consideration to replace Daniel Craig. The report, based on an unnamed source, claims that Bond is Aarons job, should he wish to accept it and that producers expect him to sign on the dotted line in the coming days. However, a separate source close to the situation tells EW that is not true. EW has reached out to EON Productions, MGM, and Taylor-Johnsons reps for comment. And so, the speculation as to who will take up the 007 mantle has once again been shaken (not stirred). So where does everything stand now? Heres everything you need to know about the search for the next James Bond. Who decides? Bond franchise producers (and real-life half-siblings) Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson are heading up the search to replace Craig, who played the character in the most recent five films: Casino Royale (2006), Quantum of Solace (2008), Skyfall (2012), Spectre (2015), and No Time to Die (2021). When will we know? In June 2022, Broccoli said that no one was in the running for the role, and that it would be at least two years before the character might return to the big screen. There isnt a script, and we cant come up with one until we decide how were going to approach the next film because, really, its a reinvention of Bond, Broccoli said. Were reinventing who he is, and that takes time. Id say that filming is at least two years away. A few months later, Broccoli told EW that theyd start considering casting in 2023 and as such no one should be waiting by the phone yet. We havent begun the hunt, she said. Were going to be sort of sitting down and trying to figure out where the Bond series is going to go, and we need to do that first, to get a sense of that, before we start casting for the role. So well start thinking about that sometime next year. So, with that in mind, the fact its currently 2024 means that, at least according to their own admissions, Broccoli and Wilson should be currently hard at work casting the new Bond. Whos being considered? Tabloid rumors and Internet wish-casting aside, we dont actually know for sure yet, but Happy Valley star James Norton, Snowfalls Damson Idris, Tom Hardy, Henry Cavill, Regé-Jean Page, Richard Madden, and now Taylor-Johnson have all been mentioned at one time or another. For years, fans of Luther star Idris Elba have also nominated him for the role, but he told The Wall Street Journal in 2022 it was unlikely hed take it on. When I look in the mirror, I dont see James Bond, Elba told the outlet at the time. After a different Sun report earlier this year claimed Oppenheimer Oscar winner Cillian Murphy was a favorite for the role, former James Bond Pierce Brosnan threw his support behind the idea, telling the BBC, Cillian Murphy would do a magnificent job as James Bond on His Majestys Secret Service. And, with all the talk of this being a reinvention for the character, would a woman perhaps be considered? Never say never, but Broccoli previously expressed doubts that thered be a gender swap. Bond is male, she told The Guardian in 2018. Hes a male character. He was written as a male and I think hell probably stay as a male. And thats fine. We dont have to turn male characters into women, Broccoli added. Lets just create more female characters and make the story fit those female characters. Ana de Armas, who played the scene-stealing, mysterious character of Paloma in No Time to Die, echoed those sentiments in July 2022, saying there is no need for a female Bond. What I would like is that the female roles in the Bond films, even though Bond will continue to be a man, are brought to life in a different way, she said, adding, That theyre given a more substantial part and recognition. Thats what I think is more interesting than flipping things. Source: Entertainment Weekly",

        "date": "March 20, 2024 04:26 pm",
        "content": "The Committee on Public Finance (COPF) has recommended that the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) defer the salary increase until a mutually acceptable solution is reached on the matter. This was mentioned in the COPF report on the Central Bank Salary Revision 2024-2026 presented to the parliament by the committees chairman Dr. Harsha de Silva on Wednesday (March 20). COPF compiled this report on the recent salary increase of the Central Bank staff members upon a request made by President Ranil Wickremesinghe in his capacity as the Finance Minister. The request came about after several MPs raised this issue in the House, joining the general outcry opposing the steep salary increase. In its recommendations, the COPF says the Finance Minister should, with immediate effect, appoint an independent remuneration committee with the concurrence of the Central Bank Governor to review the salary increase under discussion. COPF also recommended that a report on the same be submitted within 4 weeks and that Central Bank defer the salary increase until a mutually acceptable solution is arrived at, based on the findings of the report. The COPF further noted that the members of this independent remuneration committee need to be co-opted from Central Bank as well as from outside; both within and outside the public sector as necessary. COPF says it expects this committee to arrive at reasonable adjustments in remuneration for all staff categories, keeping in mind the expertise of the specialised staff and comparability of the same as relevant to the Central Bank. Proposing that the methodology for determining salaries of professional staff be decoupled from non-professional and minor staff, the COPF went on to recommend that this committee arrive at a transparent formula for future revisions to CBSL staff remuneration.

        "date": "March 20, 2024 05:00 pm",
        "content": "The Ministry of Foreign Affairs says it is closely following the prevailing situation in Haiti where the citizens are reeling from the spiral of violence that erupted after armed gangs took control of the capital city Port-au-Prince and other areas. In a statement issued on Wednesday (March 20), the ministry asserted that it is in contact with companies operating in Haiti employing Sri Lankan nationals. The companies have confirmed that the Sri Lankan nationals are safe and away from the areas where there is ongoing unrest. Meanwhile, the Embassy of Sri Lanka in Cuba accredited to Haiti remains in regular contact with the respective companies, the Foreign Ministry noted. Haitis already precarious situation has quickly deteriorated over the past weeks as gangs launched coordinated attacks on key facilities, forcing the resignation of the countrys prime minister. Haiti has been plunged into a serious humanitarian, political and security crisis following the assassination of President Jovenel Moïse in 2021, and the subsequent strengthening of criminal gangs that now dominate a significant part of the territory and have access to key infrastructures, such as ports and airports. In early March, one of these gangs orchestrated the escape of more than 3,600 prison inmates and unleashed a wave of terror in several areas of the country, leading to the resignation of prime minister Ariel Henry. Amnesty International says the recent escalation of violence has reached alarming levels, with reports of dozens of deaths, kidnappings, sexual violence against women and girls, and the forced displacement of more than 35,000 people since the beginning of 2024. According to foreign media reports, the escalation of violence in Haiti has impeded access to healthcare facilities, forced the closure of schools and worsened an already dire hunger crisis by cutting residents of gang-controlled areas off from critical supplies. To seek refuge from the chaos, many have gathered in Cap-Haitien, a coastal city in the north of Haiti, which, in truth, suffers from almost all of Haitis deepest problems: grinding poverty, chaos, disorder and corruption. But crucially, not gang violence. It is fast becoming the countrys main safe haven for people forced to leave their homes. Against this backdrop, the Haitian government declared a state of emergency on Sunday evening and imposed a three-day nightly curfew to try to restore order. But some of Haitis most powerful gang leaders  including Jimmy Barbecue Cherizier, who heads the powerful G9 gang alliance  say their goal is to bring down Henry. The Haitian prime minister was in Kenya last week when the latest unrest began. The visit aimed to revive plans for a possible UN-backed police deployment to Haiti to help stem the countrys gang violence. The two countries signed a reciprocal agreement to deploy police from the East African country to Haiti, Kenyan President William Ruto said on Friday, but it remains unclear if and when the deployment might happen. Although some Haitian civil society leaders have raised concerns about the prospect of international intervention, the countrys national police force is underfunded and ill-equipped to respond to the gangs, which the UN estimates now control about 80 percent of the capital. Schools and banks were closed amid the latest uptick in violence, and people sheltered for safety in schools, sports venues, gyms and public buildings, often without adequate toilets, health facilities or drinking water. -with inputs from agencies",

        "title": "Vietnams president resigns after just over a year in office",
        "date": "March 20, 2024 06:01 pm",
        "content": "The Vietnamese Communist Party has accepted the resignation of President Vo Van Thuong, the government said on Wednesday, in a sign of political turmoil that could hurt foreign investors confidence in the country. The government said in a statement that Thuong had violated party rules, adding that those shortcomings had negatively impacted public opinion, affecting the reputation of the Party, State and him personally. The Central Party Committee, a top decision-making body in Communist Party-ruled Vietnam, approved Thuongs resignation just about a year after his election. The president holds a largely ceremonial role but is one of the top four political positions in the Southeast Asian nation. Calls to the presidential office on Wedensday went unanswered. The committees meeting preceded an extraordinary session of Vietnams rubber-stamping parliament scheduled on Thursday, when deputies are expected to confirm the partys decisions. The government statement did not elaborate on Thuongs shortcomings, but major leadership changes in the one-party state have recently been all linked to the wide-ranging blazing furnace anti-bribery campaign. It is aimed at stamping out widespread corruption but is also suspected by critics to be a tool for political infighting. Foreign investors and diplomats have repeatedly blamed the campaign for slowing down decisions in a country which is already grappling with cumbersome bureaucracy. Thuong, 53, quit days after Vietnamese police announced the arrest for alleged corruption a decade ago of a former head of central Vietnams Quang Ngai province, who served while Thuong was party chief there. He had also been a senior party official of economic hub Ho Chi Minh City, which has been rocked by a multi-billion-dollar long-running financial scam, for which a large trial is currently underway. Thuong was widely regarded as being close to ageing General Secretary Nguyen Phu Trong, Vietnams most powerful figure and the main architect of the anti-graft campaign. Foreign investors Last year, when former president Nguyen Xuan Phuc quit after the party blamed him for violations and wrongdoing by officials under his control, it took one month and a half for lawmakers to appoint Thuong as his successor. The current political crisis may well be resolved with the swift election of a new president, but risks remain that repeated reshuffles of top leaders hurt business sentiment in a country that is highly dependent on foreign investment. The Ho Chi Minh City stock exchange, the countrys main bourse, shed on Monday nearly 3 in the first hours of trading after news began circulating about the imminent resignation of the president. Foreign investors net sales in the first two days of the week amounted to about 80 million, according to Mirae Asset Securities, a broker. Thuongs removal could see policy and administrative decisions slow further as officials are more anxious about the arc of the anti-corruption campaign, said a Vietnam-based adviser to foreign corporates, noting however that Vietnams position on key policies would not change. Investors who mostly praise political stability may not take well the premature departure of two presidents in about a year. Recent developments raise questions about predictability, reliability and internal workings of the system on which investment decisions hinge, said Florian Feyerabend, the representative in Vietnam for Germanys Konrad Adenauer Foundation, a think tank. He noted however that the overall political system of governance remains stable, and Vietnams foreign policy aimed at maintaining good relations with both the United States and China would not change.

        "title": "Intermittent fasting linked to high risk of cardiovascular death, study reveals",
        "date": "March 20, 2024 08:43 pm",
        "content": "A new study has challenged the alleged health benefits of intermittent fasting, a popular diet often praised by celebrities and health gurus alike. Intermittent fasting is a well-known practice in which you eat all your food in an eight-hour window and fast for the remaining 16 hours of the day. However, a study from the American Heart Association published on Monday, 18 March has found that limiting mealtimes to just eight hours a day was linked to a 91 per cent increase in risk of death from heart disease. Researchers, led by Dr Victor Zhong of the Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, analysed approximately 20,000 adults in the US with an average age of 49 years who had followed intermittent fasting, also known as the 16:8 plan. According to the study - which was presented at the AHAs Epidemiology and Prevention conference in Chicago, Illinois - those who limited their eating to eight hours a day were 91 per cent more likely to die from cardiovascular disease than those who ate across 12 or 16 hours. Among participants with existing cardiovascular disease, an eating duration between eight and 10 hours per day was also associated with a 66 per cent higher risk of death from heart disease or stroke. Meanwhile, people with cancer who ate for more than 16 hours a day were less likely to die from the disease. Researchers also found that time-restricted eating did not reduce the overall risk of death from any cause. Restricting daily eating time to a short period, such as eight hours per day, has gained popularity in recent years as a way to lose weight and improve heart health, said senior study author Dr Zhong. However, the long-term health effects of time-restricted eating, including risk of death from any cause or cardiovascular disease, are unknown. We were surprised to find that people who followed an eight-hour, time-restricted eating schedule were more likely to die from cardiovascular disease. Even though this type of diet has been popular due to its potential short-term benefits, our research clearly shows that, compared with a typical eating time range of 12-16 hours per day, a shorter eating duration was not associated with living longer, he said. The study analysed data from participants in the 2003-2018 National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys, and compared it to the Centers for Disease Control and Preventions National Death Index database on people who died in the US from 2003 through December 2019. Researchers acknowledged that the study was limited in its findings because it relied on self-reported dietary information, as well as failed to focus on other factors that may play a role in participants health. Overall, this study suggests that time-restricted eating may have short-term benefits but long-term adverse effects. When the study is presented in its entirety, it will be interesting and helpful to learn more of the details of the analysis, said Dr Christopher D Gardner, the Rehnborg Farquhar Professor of Medicine at Stanford University. One of those details involves the nutrient quality of the diets typical of the different subsets of participants. Without this information, it cannot be determined if nutrient density might be an alternate explanation to the findings that currently focus on the window of time for eating. Second, it needs to be emphasised that categorisation into the different windows of time-restricted eating was determined on the basis of just two days of dietary intake, he said. Approximately half of the participants were men and half were women. Around 73 per cent of the participants were non-Hispanic white adults, while 11 per cent were Hispanic. Eight per cent of participants were non-Hispanic Black adults, and nearly seven per cent of adults identified as another race. It will also be critical to see a comparison of demographics and baseline characteristics across the groups that were classified into the different time-restricted eating windows, added Gardner. For example, was the group with the shortest time-restricted eating window unique compared to people who followed other eating schedules, in terms of weight, stress, traditional cardiometabolic risk factors or other factors associated with adverse cardiovascular outcomes? This additional information will help to better understand the potential independent contribution of the short time-restricted eating pattern reported in this interesting and provocative abstract. In June 2023, a similar study analysed the weight loss results for adults with obesity who participated in intermittent fasting, compared to traditional calorie counting. The results, which were published in the journal Annals of Internal Medicine, found that those who engaged in eight-hour time restricted eating had improved insulin sensitivity compared to those in the control group who ate their calories any time over 10 or more hours a day.

        "title": "President Ranil unveils vision for rapid transformation into export economy",
        "date": "March 20, 2024 09:19 pm",
        "content": "If Sri Lanka continues to rely on borrowing to address the imbalance between imports and exports, the nation will inevitably confront another economic crisis within a decade, says President Ranil Wickremesinghe. He also underscored his vision to establish economic stability and expedite the transformation of Sri Lanka into an export-oriented economy. The President said that a new law is planned to be introduced to parliament in April, alongside another legislation aimed at improving financial governance within the government. These measures are designed to propel the nations economy forward. Wickremesinghe made these remarks during his attendance at the inauguration ceremony of Bodhigara and Golden Fence, constructed near the historic Mangedara Tempita Viharaya in Kegalle today (March 20). The President also noted that negotiations concerning certifying Sri Lanka as a debt-paying country are anticipated to conclude by June and July. He further emphasized that the foreign aid lost due to the country being labelled as bankrupt will be retrieved and returned to the nation. Additionally, the President highlighted that the countrys economy will receive a boost as the national currency strengthens with the renewed engagement of foreign banks and companies that had previously refrained from conducting business with Sri Lanka. Reflecting on how all citizens were impacted during the previous economic crisis, the President also stressed that the benefits of the growing economy are meant for everyone, not just a select few. The President, who visited the historic Mangedara Tempita Viharaya in Kegalle, unveiled a commemorative plaque, inaugurating the new Bodhigara and golden fence, and offered flowers at the Bodhiya. This new Bodhigara and golden fence were erected following guidance from Ven. Sri Jananandabhidana Nayaka Thero, the Viharadhipathi of the Mangedara Tampita Viharaya and Chief Sanghanayaka of Kegalu Maha Disawa. The President also granted commemorative gifts upon Jagath Sumitra Karunaratne and Mallika Karunaratne. Addressing the gathering President Ranil Wickremesinghe further said: We are looking forward to talking to the International Monetary Fund and wrapping up our work soon. In 2022, Sri Lanka was labelled as a bankrupt country. Because of this, international financial institutions and banks stopped providing us with support and loans. Our first priority is to lift this ban. Therefore, we need to reaffirm that we are a country that pays its debts. Over the past year, we have played a crucial role in rescuing the country from economic troubles. If these challenges persist, we may endure another two or three years of hardship. However, as an initial step, we have now reached the final stage of the governments program aimed at steering the country away from bankruptcy. Achieving this required numerous steps, but weve successfully executed them in a remarkably short timeframe. The on-going discussions are reaching their last phase, and we anticipate wrapping them up by tomorrow. Following that, our objective is to proceed with negotiations involving the countries that have provided loans to us. This process is being overseen by France, Japan, and India, who are chairing the discussions involving all the countries that have officially lent money to us. The local staff and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) are anticipated to reach a staff-level agreement this weekend after concluding their discussions. Concurrently, discussions with China are on-going, and discussions with private creditors are underway. The Secretary to the Ministry of Finance and the Governor of the Central Bank are scheduled to return to Europe to engage in discussions with these groups. Following the declaration of our bankruptcy-free status, a joint meeting of the World Bank and the IMF is planned for April. Subsequently, the relevant agreement is expected to be signed shortly thereafter. I aim to complete all these tasks by June and July, especially considering the upcoming presidential and parliamentary elections. Its crucial to finish these activities before the elections. Once completed, we will demonstrate to the world that we are capable of repaying our debts, which will lead to the return of aid money that we havent received yet and an increase in the countrys dollar reserves. Currently, many banks and companies are hesitant to engage in business with us, but once these activities are concluded, they will resume business with us. Consequently, our available funds are expected to increase. We have passed a challenging period and had to make tough decisions to overcome this situation. However, we have now reached a point where we can offer some relief. The rupee has been strengthening, and its expected to reach Rs.280 rupees by June, leading to a decrease in the prices of goods. We anticipate the rupee will continue to strengthen next year as well. Moreover, salaries of the government employees have increased by Rs. 10,000 before the Sinhala Tamil New Year. Additionally, the Aswasuma program has been introduced to provide benefits three times higher than Samurdhiya to the people, with the number of beneficiary families increasing from 800, 000 to 2,400,000. Considering these factors, the relief provided to the people as a bankrupt country is three times greater than what was provided during a stable economy. These efforts ultimately benefit the countrys economy. Additionally, the funds that were not used for decentralized budgeting over the past two years will be released, contributing to the countrys economic growth. Looking ahead, we have opportunities for further progress after June. Stabilizing the countrys economy alone will not solve all our problems because we are currently reliant on imports, leading to a trade imbalance where exports are lower than imports. This gap is often bridged through foreign loans, which sets us up for another economic crisis in about a decade. To prevent such a scenario, I plan to hold discussions with the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank, and the International Monetary Fund to initiate a program aimed at swiftly transitioning the country towards an export-oriented economy. As a fundamental step, we have introduced the agricultural modernization program, which will require another 6 to 7 years to achieve success. It is worth mentioning that the proposed law aims to foster economic stability and transition the country into an export-based economy. I plan to present this law to Parliament by April. Additionally, another law focused on financial governance within the government will be introduced, enabling us to sustain economic activities effectively. The previous economic challenges impacted everyone in the country. Therefore, the benefits of the developing economy should not be limited to a select few but should extend to all citizens. --PMD",

        "date": "March 20, 2024 10:43 pm",
        "content": "The first meeting of the Committee on Public Enterprises (COPE) under the chairmanship of MP Rohitha Abeygunawardana convened at the parliament complex on Tuesday (March 19) amidst a string of member resignations. As many as 10 COPE members  namely MPs Anura Kumara Dissanayake, Duminda Dissanayake, Eran Wickramaratne, Gamini Waleboda, Prof. Charitha Herath, Dayasiri Jayasekara, S. M. Marikkar, Hesha Withanage, Shanakiyan Rasamanickam and Wasantha Yapa Bandara  have thus far quit the committee, taking issue with the appointment of Abeygunawardana. At the commencement of yesterdays meeting, the new COPE chairman stated that although it is possible to summon 363 institutions before the committee 102 institutions have not been summoned before the Committee so far. He also made a full presentation on the objectives of COPE and the functioning of the Committee so far. According to the Parliaments Communications Department, this is the first time in the history of COPE that a new chairman has made such clarification. The State Plantation Corporation of Sri Lanka was summoned before COPE today to examine the Auditor Generals reports and current performance for the years 2017 and 2018. Accordingly, the Auditor General pointed out that in the entirety of 27 years, the Sri Lanka State Plantation Corporation has made a profit in only 4 years. It was also disclosed that 7 of the 10 tea factories owned by the Plantation Corporation, which is continuously losing money, are inactive. However, the audit pointed out that the corporation had not taken any action to resume production or lease out the inactive tea factories. Officials of Sri Lanka State Plantation Corporation informed to the COPE that the primary reason for the corporations continuous losses was lack of capital. The officials further commented that due to the lack of capital, the failure to use fertilizers and related herbicides at the right time was also a reason for the losses. However, the COPE pointed out to the officials concerned that the main reason for the losses of the Corporation was not the lack of capital itself. Accordingly, the Committee presented data on the very high employee cost of the Plantation Corporation and it was disclosed that the employee cost of the Sri Lanka Plantation Corporation is about 75. Furthermore, there was a discussion at length in the Committee regarding the acquisition of the land owned by the Plantation Corporation given on lease basis by third parties. Accordingly, the COPE chairman instructed the officials to promptly implement the necessary legal procedures to recover the illegally acquired lands. The COPE chairman further instructed officials to immediately re-survey the land available to the Sri Lanka Plantation Corporation and submit a detailed report on which lands have been given by the Plantation Corporation on lease basis, who are the institutions and individuals who have given the land, the money contracted for them and the income obtained from the land given on lease basis. Furthermore, it was disclosed that the Plantation Corporation has to pay 1.5 billion in various payments including Employee Provident Fund and Employee Trust Fund for the employees of the company. Accordingly, the Chair also instructed the officials to intervene immediately and prepare a program to complete the relevant payments within the next two months. Additionally, a comprehensive plan for the period 2024-2028 of the plantation corporation was presented to the council. However, the Committee questioned the officials regarding the lack of inclusion in the relevant business plan of the proposals prepared for the institution to gain profit. Accordingly, the COPE chairman who expressed his regret that other parties have created the compact plan without knowing the needs of his company, gave instructions to prepare a compact plan within 02 months by including the future program of the company to be implemented immediately. Furthermore, the chairman expressed its displeasure about the absence of a proper data system regarding the vehicles of the Plantation Corporation, and Abeygunawardana instructed the officials to send a detailed report to the Committee immediately. Yesterdays meeting was attended by State Ministers Janaka Wakkumbura and Indika Anuruddha, and MPs Dayasiri Jayasekara, Shantha Bandara, Sanjeeva Edirimanna, Hesha Withanage, Prof. Ranjith Bandara, Jagath Kumara Sumithraarachchi, Shanakiyan Rasamanickam, Major Sudarshana Denipitiya, Upul Mahendra Rajapaksha, Auditor General W.P.C. Wickramaratne and other officials.",

        "date": "March 21, 2024 09:55 am",
        "content": "Global investors and Sri Lanka officials expect to start negotiations aimed at restructuring 12 billion in defaulted global bonds next week, according to people familiar with the matter. The nations dollar bonds rose. A group of bondholders, known as a steering committee, will begin talks as they weigh a proposal from the government to rework the overseas debt that has been in default since 2022, the people said, declining to be named because negotiations are private. The goal is to reach a deal quickly, the people said, particularly as Sri Lanka is scheduled to hold presidential elections later this year. The nations central bank governor and treasury secretary are due to travel to Europe for discussions with bondholders, President Ranil Wickremesinghe was cited as saying in a Sinhala-language statement from his media unit March 20. After we get a declaration that Sri Lanka is free from bankruptcy, we also expect to have joint discussions with the International Monetary Fund and World Bank in April, Wickremesinghe said, according to the statement. I expect to complete all these matters by June-July. Rothschild  Co., which advises the bondholders, and Lazard Inc., an adviser to the government, didnt immediately respond to a request for comment. The prospect for a deal in Sri Lanka comes as creditor talks in two other stalled restructurings  Ghana and Zambia  are also gaining traction. Breakthroughs in those cases would mark a victory for the International Monetary Fund and G-20 leaders ahead of next months meetings of world leaders in Washington, D.C., where the topic of debt burdens for poor countries is on the agenda. Last month, Sri Lanka sent a proposal to holders of dollar bonds as part of its plan to overhaul 27 billion of foreign debt, including bonds and loans. The restructuring is critical to ensure financing from the IMF bailout keeps flowing. President Ranil Wickremesinghe said in February that authorities expect to complete the debt revamp within the first half of the year. The government has already struck deals with official creditors, including China, India and the Paris Club as well as with holders of its local debt. Source: Bloomberg --Agencies",

        "content": "The third day of the parliamentary debate on the no-confidence motion against Speaker Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena commenced at 09.30 a.m. today (March 21). The debate is slated to end at 4.30 p.m. followed by a vote on the no-confidence motion. The parliamentary debate on the no-confidence motion tabled by the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) was initially slated to be held for two days, however the Committee on Parliamentary Business later decided for it to be debated for three consecutive days. The debate commenced in the Parliament on Tuesday (March 19). The motion brought forth by the opposition against the Speaker was officially handed over to the Deputy General Secretary of Parliament on March 05. It had been signed by 44 parliamentarians including Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa, Chief Opposition Whip Lakshman Kiriella and MPs Prof. G.L. Peiris, Rohini Kumari Wijeratne, Hesha Vithanage, Mano Ganesan, Rishad Bathiudeen, M.A. Sumanthiran, S.M.

The Speaker is also accused of allowing the third Reading of the Online Safety Bill to be passed without a vote and disregarding the Chief Opposition Whips call for a division at the Committee Stage. Further, the opposition MPs claim that the Speaker had unconstitutionally and unlawfully used his decisive vote to affirm the appointment of IGP Deshabandu Tennakoon when the other members of the Constitutional Council were divided on a tie on the matter. It was reported that four members had voted in favour of the appointment while 2 voted against and 2 others abstained. However, considering the 2 abstentions as votes cast against, the Speaker had used his vote as the deciding vote to go ahead with the appointment, they allege.",

        "date": "March 21, 2024 12:16 pm",
        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe has unveiled immediate plans to swiftly develop the Mahaweli A and B zones, previously overlooked by the Mahaweli project, as part of the nations transition towards a modern agricultural economy. Further, he emphasized that this initiative would bring significant benefits to the people residing in these areas, the Presidents Media Division (PMD) said. Without the pioneering efforts of the late Mr. Gamini Dissanayake in implementing the Mahaweli project, which revolutionized irrigation practices in the country, Wickremesinghe said Sri Lanka would not have achieved self-sufficiency in rice production nor would it have met its electricity demands. The Head of State made this statement while participating in the ceremony commemorating late Minister Gamini Dissanayakes 82nd birth anniversary on Wednesday afternoon (March 20). The ceremony took place in front of the Gamini Dissanayake statue at Ananda Kumaraswamy Mawatha in Colombo. Reflecting on the memories of Mr. Dissanayake, the President emphasized that his dedication serves as an exemplary model for all. President Ranil Wickremesinghe honoured Mr. Dissanayake by laying floral tributes at his statue. The commemoration celebrations commenced with religious ceremonies and a minute of silence was observed to honour the memory of all the heroes who sacrificed their lives for the nation, including those who perished in the Totalaga tragedy on October 23, 1994, alongside Mr. Dissanayake, other national leaders, and the Attorney-at-law late Mrs. Srima Dissanayake, founder of the Gamini Dissanayake Foundation. The welcome address for the ceremony was delivered by MP Mayantha Dissanayake, who serves as the Vice President of the Gamini Dissanayake Foundation. Former Speaker Karu Jayasuriya, while sharing his thoughts, described Gamini Dissanayakes character as a political precedent, emphasizing his popularity and service to the people. Mr. Jayasuriya highlighted Dissanayakes effective leadership, attributing Sri Lankas rapid development to his astute management. Chairman of the Gamini Dissanayake Foundation, Governor of the Sabaragamuwa Province Mr. Navin Dissanayake, reflected on his fathers legacy as a former leader of the United National Party. He emphasized Gamini Dissanayakes belief in the partys economic system as suitable for the country. Navin Dissanayake expressed hope for a future moderate right-wing movement and voiced his desire for such a leader to be elected by the people in the upcoming presidential election.",

        "date": "March 21, 2024 01:25 pm",
        "content": "Australia will begin enforcing tougher visa rules for foreign students this week as official data showed migration hit another record high, which is likely to further exacerbate an already tight rental market. From Saturday, English language requirements for student and graduate visas will be increased, while the government will get the power to suspend education providers from recruiting international students if they repeatedly break rules. The actions this weekend will continue to drive migration levels down while delivering on our commitments in the migration strategy to fix the broken system we inherited, Home Affairs Minister Clare ONeil said in a statement. A new genuine student test will be introduced to further crack down on international students who look to come to Australia primarily to work, while the imposition of no further stay conditions will be used on more visitor visas. The moves follow a raft of actions last year to close off COVID-era concessions introduced by the former government, including unrestricted working hours for international students. The government at the time said rules would be tightened for students that could halve its migrant intake over two years. Australia boosted its annual migration numbers in 2022 to help businesses recruit staff to fill shortages after the COVID-19 pandemic brought strict border controls, and kept foreign students and workers out for nearly two years. But the sudden influx of foreign workers and students has exacerbated pressure on an already tight rental market. Date released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics on Thursday showed net immigration rose 60 to a record 548,800 in the year to Sept. 30, 2023, higher than the 518,000 people in the year ending June 2023. Overall, Australias population rose 2.5 - the fastest pace on record - to 26.8 million people in the year to last September. The record migration - driven by students from India, China and Philippines - has expanded labour supply and restrained wage pressures, but it exacerbated an already tight housing market where rental vacancies hovered at record lows and elevated construction costs restricted new supply. ONeil said the governments actions since September have led to a decline in migration levels, with recent international student visa grants down by 35 on the previous year.

        "date": "March 21, 2024 02:47 pm",
        "content": "The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has launched a new country partnership strategy (CPS) for Sri Lanka covering the period 20242028. The strategy will focus on restoring the countrys macroeconomic stability, reviving growth, and establishing the foundation for sustainable recovery and resilience. This new partnership strategy will build on ADBs ongoing assistance to support the countrys efforts to restore macroeconomic stability, and to achieve green and long-term sustainable growth, said ADB Country Director for Sri Lanka Takafumi Kadono. The CPS responds to Sri Lankas economic situation by tailoring ADB assistance to address the countrys long-standing macroeconomic imbalances and structural impediments through knowledge solutions, policy advisory support, and priority investments. Sri Lanka is showing signs of stability and recovery from a deep economic crisis. Inflation significantly declined from 69.8 to 4.0 between September 2022 and December 2023. Foreign exchange reserves have increased to 4.4 billion in 2023 from 1.9 billion in 2022. Sri Lankas economic growth returned to positive territory in the second half of 2023 and that momentum is likely to continue. ADBs assistance under the new CPS will focus on three strategic objectives: strengthening public financial management and governance; fostering private sector development promoting green growth; and improving access to climate-smart public services and deepening inclusion. Three thematic prioritiesclimate action, disaster resilience, and environmental sustainability; gender equality and social inclusion; and governance, capacity development, and digitalizationwill be integrated into the CPS objectives. The new CPS will support the countrys efforts to tackle the key underlying causes of the crisis. ADB will focus on reforming public financial management system, strengthening governance, accelerating domestic resource mobilization, and improving fiscal and debt sustainability, as well as measures to improve the performance of state-owned enterprises. The strategy recognizes the critical role of the private sector in the countrys recovery and long-term economic growth. Structural reforms to promote greater private sector participation in the economy and diversify the economy with emphasis on green and sustainable growth will be supported under the new strategy. ADB will continue to support financial inclusion and small and medium-sized enterprises development, especially those managed by women, and provide advisory and capacity building support to promote trade and investment. The strategy aims to improve access to climate-smart public services and deepen inclusion through strengthening social protection and human capital development and fostering agriculture modernization. As of the end of December 2023, ADB had committed more than 3.7 billion in 45 public sector loans and grants in Sri Lanka, as well as 25.6 million in private sector investments. ADB is committed to achieving a prosperous, inclusive, resilient, and sustainable Asia and the Pacific, while sustaining its efforts to eradicate extreme poverty. Established in 1966, it is owned by 68 members49 from the region. -ADB-",

        "date": "March 21, 2024 03:09 pm",
        "content": "IMF staff and the Sri Lankan authorities have reached staff-level agreement on economic policies to conclude the second review of the 4-year EFF-supported program and the 2024 Article IV Consultation. Once the review is approved by IMF Management and completed by the IMF Executive Board, Sri Lanka will have access to SDR 254 million (about US337 million) in financing, bringing the total IMF financial support disbursed under the arrangement to SDR 762 million (about US1 billion), the International Monetary Fund (IMF) said. Macroeconomic policy reforms are starting to bear fruit. Sustaining the reform momentum and addressing governance weaknesses and corruption vulnerabilities are critical to put the economy on a path towards lasting recovery and stable and inclusive growth. Completion of the review by the IMFs Executive Board requires: (i) the implementation by the authorities of prior actions; (ii) the completion of financing assurances review, confirming multilateral partners financing contributions and assessing adequate progress with debt restructuring. After constructive discussions in Colombo, IMF Senior Mission Chief Mr. Peter Breuer and Deputy Mission Chief Ms. Katsiaryna Svirydzenka issued the following statement: The IMF team reached staff-level agreement with the Sri Lankan authorities on the second review under the economic reform program supported by a 4-year Extended Fund Facility (EFF) arrangement and concluded the 2024 Article IV Consultation discussions. The EFF arrangement was approved by the IMF Executive Board for a total amount of SDR 2.3 billion (about US3 billion) on March 20, 2023. The staff-level agreement is subject to the approval by IMF management and the IMF Executive Board in the period ahead, contingent on: (i) the implementation by the authorities of prior actions; (ii) the completion of financing assurances review, which will focus on confirming multilateral partners committed financing contributions and whether adequate progress has been made with the debt restructuring to give confidence that the restructuring will be concluded in a timely manner and in line with the programs debt targets. Upon completion of the Executive Board review, Sri Lanka would have access to SDR 254 million (about US337 million), bringing the total IMF financial support disbursed under the arrangement to SDR 762 million (about US1 billion). The authorities are making good progress in implementing an ambitious reform agenda under the EFF with commendable outcomes, including rapid disinflation, robust reserve accumulation, and initial signs of economic growth while preserving the stability of the financial system. Public finances have strengthened following substantial fiscal reforms. Program performance was strong, with all quantitative performance criteria and indicative targets for end-December 2023 met except for the indicative target on social spending. Most structural benchmarks due before end-February 2024 were either met or implemented with delay. Reforms in some areas are still ongoing. The economic situation is gradually improving. Growth turned positive after six consecutive quarters of contraction, registering 1.6 percent and 4.5 percent y-o-y growth in the third and fourth quarters of 2023 respectively. High-frequency economic indicators point to a continued pick-up in manufacturing, construction, and services. Inflation has come down from a peak of 70 percent in September 2022 to 5.9 percent in February 2024. Gross official reserves increased to US4.5 billion at end-February 2024 with sizeable foreign exchange purchases by the central bank. Sustaining the reform momentum is critical to put the economy on a path towards lasting recovery and stable and inclusive economic growth. We welcome the authorities commitment to fiscal reforms. Continued progress towards the introduction of the property tax is critical, together with revenue measures to meet the revenue mobilization goals in 2025 and beyond. Revenue administration and anti-corruption efforts to boost tax collections are also key. Maintaining cost recovery in fuel and electricity pricing will help minimize fiscal risks arising from state-owned enterprises. While inflation has decelerated faster than expected, continued monitoring is warranted to help anchor inflationary pressures and support macroeconomic stability. Against ongoing external uncertainty, it remains important to continue to rebuild external buffers through strong reserves accumulation. Sri Lankas Agreements in principle with the Official Creditor Committee and Export-Import Bank of China on debt treatments consistent with program parameters were important milestones putting Sri Lankas debt on the path towards sustainability. The critical next steps are to finalize the agreements with the official creditors and reach Agreements in Principle with the main external private creditors in line with program parameters in a timely manner. This should help restore Sri Lankas debt sustainability over the medium term. The authorities recently published Action Plan to implement the key recommendations of the Governance Diagnostic Report is a welcome step. Sustained efforts to implement these reforms will be essential for addressing corruption risks, rebuilding economic confidence, and making growth more robust and inclusive. The IMF mission team met with tea plantation workers in Nuwara Eliya and learned first-hand about some of the challenges Sri Lankas most vulnerable face. Continued efforts to improve targeting, adequacy, and coverage of social safety nets, particularly Aswesuma, remain critical to protect the poor and the vulnerable. The IMF team held meetings with President and Finance Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, Central Bank of Sri Lanka Governor Dr. P. Nandalal Weerasinghe, Minister of Power and Energy Mr. Kanchana Wijesekera, State Minister Mr. Shehan Semasinghe, Chief of Staff to the President Mr. Sagala Ratnayaka, Secretary to the Treasury Mr. K M Mahinda Siriwardana, and other senior government and CBSL officials. The team also met with Parliamentarians, representatives from the private sector, civil society organizations, and development partners. We would like to thank the authorities for the excellent collaboration.",

        "title": "Extreme heat at work can double stillbirth risk, India study finds",
        "date": "March 21, 2024 04:04 pm",
        "content": "Working in extreme heat can double the risk of stillbirth and miscarriage for pregnant women, according to new research from India. The study found that the risks to mothers-to-be are significantly higher than previously thought. Researchers say hotter summers can affect not only women in tropical climates, but also in countries such as the UK. They want specific health advice for working pregnant women globally. Eight hundred pregnant women in the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu took part in the study, which was started in 2017 by the Faculty of Public Health at the Sri Ramachandra Institute of Higher Education and Research (SRIHER) in Chennai. About half of those who took part worked in jobs where they were exposed to high levels of heat, such as agriculture, brick kilns and salt flats. The others worked in cooler environments, such as schools and hospitals, although some workers were also exposed to very high levels of heat in those jobs too. There is no universal threshold for what level of heat is considered to be too hot for the human body. The impact of heat is relative to what youre used to and what your bodys used to, says Prof Jane Hirst, one of the scientists who contributed to the study. She removes her thick gloves and stretches out her fingers. She has been picking cucumbers for the past two hours. My hands burn in this heat, she tells me, gently caressing her fingertips. Summer hasnt even started yet, but already it is about 30 degrees here today and feeling hotter with the humidity. Sumathy has to protect her hands from the constant stabbing of the tiny spikes on the cucumbers, but the gloves make her sweat profusely. My face burns too, she says. She comes to the cucumber farm before and after her main job, working as a cook in a school, and is paid about 200 rupees or just under 2 for her efforts. Sumathy was one of the first recruits. Her baby was also one of the first in the study to die. I used to feel so exhausted being pregnant and working in the heat, she says. One day, as Sumathy was dropping off her husbands lunch, she suddenly started feeling very unwell. That evening, she went to see a doctor who told her she had suffered a miscarriage 12 weeks into her pregnancy. My husband would lay me down on his lap and console me. I dont know what I would have done without him, she says. Sumathy talks about her husband with so much love but has had to learn to live without him. He recently died, and she is now the main breadwinner for the family. Sumathy will never know for sure if working in the heat during her pregnancy had anything to do with her losing her first child. But overall, the study found that women who worked in similar conditions as her were twice as likely to suffer a stillbirth or miscarriage than those working in cooler environments. Important for women all over the world The pregnant women in the study in India really are at the forefront of experiencing climate change, says Prof Hirst, who is a UK-based consultant obstetrician, and Professor of Global Womens Health at medical research organisation The George Institute. Earths average temperature is projected to rise by nearly three degrees by the end of the century, compared with pre-industrial times, and the World Health Organization (WHO) is warning of an existential threat to all of us with pregnant women facing some of the gravest consequences. Previous studies have shown about a 15 rise in the risk of premature birth and stillbirth during heatwaves, but these have generally been conducted in high-income countries such as the US and Australia. The latest findings from India are particularly stark and worrying, says Prof Hirst, and have wider implications. The UK is getting hotter summers, and while its not as hot as India, these adverse effects on pregnancies can be seen at much lower temperatures in more temperate climates, such as the UK. However, she adds, they do need to be kept in perspective. Even with a doubling of risk, experiencing baby loss is still going to be a rare event for most women. There is currently no official international advice for pregnant working women in the heat. The main guidance that does exist for hot-weather working, is based on studies involving a man in the US military in the 1960s and 70s, weighing 70-75kg and with 20 body fat. Prof Hirst hopes this study, and further research, will change that. In the meantime, Prof Hirst and Prof Vidhya Venugopal, from the Faculty of Public Health at SRIHER, who led the research on India, say pregnant women working in the heat can protect themselves by: Avoiding prolonged periods in the heat Taking regular shade breaks if working outdoors on hot days Avoiding exercising or sunbathing for long periods in the hottest part of the day Keeping hydrated with water For the study in India, the researchers used what is called the wet-bulb-globe-temperature (WBGT), which measures the effects of temperature, humidity, wind speed and radiant heat on human bodies. WBGT readings are often lower than the temperatures you might see forecast on the TV or a weather app. The safe heat threshold for people doing heavy work is 27.5C WBGT, according to the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration. No choice but to work out in the sun India is predicted to become one of the first countries in the world where temperatures will top the safe limit for healthy people who are simply resting in the shade, according to a recent study from the University of Cambridge. The number of hot days and hot nights (when the body struggles to recover from daytime heat) is also projected to double or even quadruple in India by 2050. In the sugarcane fields of Tiruvannamalai, Rekha Shanmugam, a former nurse and one of the SRIHER studys researchers, is measuring the daytime heat. Around us, a couple of dozen workers - about half of them women - hack down thick stems of cane with small machetes. These women often have no choice but to work out in the sun - they need the money, says Ms Shanmugam. She pours water into a gauge and presses various buttons. It shows a WBGT temperature of 29.5C - thats above the safe threshold for doing this type of physically demanding work in the heat. If the workers continue for prolonged periods in this level of heat, they are more prone to heat-related illnesses, and its especially concerning for pregnant women, she tells me. Sandhiya, 28, tells me she has no choice but to do this type of back-breaking work for which she gets paid about 600 rupees, just under 6 a day. She has two young children and an extended family to feed. Sandhiya also took part in the study - and lost her first child six months into her pregnancy. She had to take several months off work to recover and says she is still paying off the debts she racked up during that time. All my desires centre around my children, Sandhiya tells me. I want them to study well and get good jobs. They shouldnt end up toiling here in the fields like me. The problem of peeing The mechanisms around how and why heat impacts pregnant women and their growing babies in this troubling way are not well understood. A previous study in The Gambia found high temperatures could raise foetal heart rate and slow blood flow through the umbilical cord. One theory is that when the mother gets too hot, blood could be diverted away from the foetus, to help cool the mother down. Ms Shanmugam thinks a lack of toilets may also be playing a part. She says a previous study found many women didnt want to squat in an open field to relieve themselves and so would avoid drinking water, developing urinary problems as a result. They worry about insects and snakes in the bushes, or men peeping to look at them, she says. They often dont feel safe, so theyll just hold it in for the whole day and then finally go to the toilet when they get home. Finding solutions India has made huge improvements to maternal and baby health in recent years, but the stillbirth rate is still 12.2 per 1,000 births, according to data from the World Bank Group. In the UK the rate is 2.7. The findings of the study in Tamil Nadu are being taken very seriously, says Dr TS Selbavinayagam, the states director for public health. We already offer financial compensation to pregnant women, but maybe we need to look at options for giving alternative employment too, he says. The state government offers poorer women 18,000 rupees (170) when they reach 12 weeks of pregnancy, to try to ease some of their financial pressures. However, much of the power to protect these low-paid workers rests with workplace bosses. On the outskirts of Chennai, Thillai Bhasker - a brick-kiln owner - has erected giant steel roofs with special heat-protective coatings on them, to provide his workers with much-needed shade. Business owners should be smart enough to know how to retain the employees, he says. If you take care of them, they will take care of you. He also told us he was planning to build women-only toilets. Some organisations are also offering education sessions on the simple steps women can take to better protect themselves in the heat.

        "date": "March 21, 2024 04:20 pm",
        "content": "The Governor of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) has informed the Committee on Public Finance (COPF) today (March 21) that they accepted all recommendations from COPF report on salary revisions, the Chairman of the COPF, MP Dr. Harsha de Silva said. He also mentioned that President Ranil Wickremesinghe will appoint a committee to review salaries as soon as possible, until which salary increases will be deferred from next month. Furthermore, he stated that they have agreed on a 4-week timeframe for the committees report to ensure a swift resolution. Taking to X (formerly Twitter) to announce this, MP de Silva said: I am glad we were able to come to a consensus without an amendment to the CBSL Act. Thank you to all involved for working towards a positive outcome. On Wednesday (March 20), the COPF recommended to the Central Bank to defer the salary increases until a mutually acceptable solution is reached on the matter. This was mentioned in the COPF report on the Central Bank Salary Revision 2024-2026, presented to the parliament by the committees chairman Dr. Harsha de Silva. COPF compiled this report on the recent salary increase of the Central Bank staff members upon a request made by President Ranil Wickremesinghe, in his capacity as the Finance Minister. The request came about after several MPs raised this issue in the House, joining the general outcry opposing the steep salary increase. In its recommendations, the COPF says the Finance Minister should, with immediate effect, appoint an independent remuneration committee with the concurrence of the Central Bank Governor to review the salary increase under discussion. COPF also recommended that a report on the same be submitted within 4 weeks and that Central Bank defer the salary increase until a mutually acceptable solution is arrived at, based on the findings of the report. The COPF further noted that the members of this independent remuneration committee need to be co-opted from Central Bank as well as from outside; both within and outside the public sector as necessary. COPF says it expects this committee to arrive at reasonable adjustments in remuneration for all staff categories, keeping in mind the expertise of the specialised staff and comparability of the same as relevant to the Central Bank. Proposing that the methodology for determining salaries of professional staff be decoupled from non-professional and minor staff, the COPF went on to recommend that this committee arrive at a transparent formula for future revisions to CBSL staff remuneration.

        "date": "March 21, 2024 04:48 pm",
        "content": "The vote on the no-confidence motion against Speaker of the Parliament Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena, was defeated in the Parliament today (March 21), following a three-day debate. The Speaker survived the no-confidence motion, moved by the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB), by a majority of 42 votes. A total of 117 lawmakers had voted against the motion while 75 voted in favour. Accordingly, Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena will continue to function as the Speaker of the Parliament of Sri Lanka. The third day of the parliamentary debate on the no-confidence motion against the Speaker commenced at 09.30 a.m. this morning. The parliamentary debate on the no-confidence motion tabled by the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) was initially slated to be held for two days, however the Committee on Parliamentary Business later decided for it to be debated for three consecutive days. The debate commenced in the Parliament on Tuesday (March 19). The motion brought forth by the opposition against the Speaker was officially handed over to the Deputy General Secretary of Parliament on March 05. It had been signed by 44 parliamentarians including Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa, Chief Opposition Whip Lakshman Kiriella and MPs Prof. G.L. Peiris, Rohini Kumari Wijeratne, Hesha Vithanage, Mano Ganesan, Rishad Bathiudeen, M.A. Sumanthiran, S.M. Marikkar, Ranjith Madduma Bandara, Thalatha Atukorale, Vijitha Herath and Chandima Weerakkody. The no-confidence motion alleges that the Speaker had ignored the Supreme Courts recommendations pertaining to Sections 13, 17, 20, 33 (6), 34 (1), 35 (1), 21, 22 and 33 of the Online Safety Bill. The Speaker is also accused of allowing the third Reading of the Online Safety Bill to be passed without a vote and disregarding the Chief Opposition Whips call for a division at the Committee Stage. Further, the opposition MPs claim that the Speaker had unconstitutionally and unlawfully used his decisive vote to affirm the appointment of IGP Deshabandu Tennakoon when the other members of the Constitutional Council were divided on a tie on the matter. It was reported that four members had voted in favour of the appointment while 2 voted against and 2 others abstained. However, considering the 2 abstentions as votes cast against, the Speaker had used his vote as the deciding vote to go ahead with the appointment, they allege.",

        "date": "March 21, 2024 05:20 pm",
        "content": "Acknowledging that the independence of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) is an absolutely key pillar under its program, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has said that it is important to maintain a high degree of transparency to explain how the CBSLs decisions are benchmarked. These remarks were made by Peter Breuer, the IMF Senior Mission Chief for Sri Lanka, while responding to a question raised by a media person on the recent controversy on the CBSLs independence and unprecedented salary hikes. A special press briefing was convened by the visiting IMF delegation on Thursday (March 21) to announce the staff-level agreement reached between the IMF staff and Sri Lankan authorities on economic policies to conclude the second review of the 4-year EFF-supported program and the 2024 Article IV Consultation. When asked if there has been any delay in reaching agreements with official creditors and China Export-Import (EXIM) Bank, Mr. Breuer said it is common for these procedures to take some time, however, he urged that the debt restructuring process be moved along expeditiously because it seals what has been agreed. The IMF Mission Chief noted that it is critical for Sri Lanka to finalize the agreements with official creditors and reach agreements in principle with the main external private creditors in line with program parameters in a timely manner. Mr. Breuer is of the view that this should help restore Sri Lankas debt sustainability over the medium term. He told reporters that the IMF looks to see swift progress with the outstanding items, in particular reaching an agreement with international creditors, including private bondholders and China EXIM Bank to cement the path to debt sustainability. Asked about the IMF teams interactions with opposition politicians in Sri Lanka and their reaction to maintaining the IMF programs conditions amidst coming elections, he said that they are willing to listen to alternative suggestions of how the IMF program objectives can be reached as long as they are realistic and achievable within the timeframe of the program. For us what is absolutely key is that the program objectives are achieved. Because Sri Lanka has a chance of emerging from the crisis. The path is a knife-edge path. We are willing to listen to alternative suggestions of how the program objectives can be reached. These must be realistic and achievable within the timeframe of the IMF program which was the result of robust discussions that we had in the summer of 2022, he said.",

        "date": "March 21, 2024 05:50 pm",
        "content": "UNITED NATIONS (AP)  The General Assembly is set to vote Thursday on what would be the first United Nations resolution on artificial intelligence, aimed at ensuring the powerful new technology benefits all nations, respects human rights and is safe, secure and trustworthy. The United States, which sponsored the resolution, has said it hopes the world body will adopt it by consensus, meaning it would have the support of all 193 U.N. member nations. U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said that if the resolution is adopted it will be a historic step forward in fostering the safe use of AI. The resolution would represent global support for a baseline set of principles for the development and use of AI and would lay out a path to leverage AI systems for good while managing the risks, he said in a statement to The Associated Press earlier in March. The draft resolution aims to close the digital divide between rich developed countries and poorer developing countries and make sure they are all at the table in discussions on AI. It also aims to make sure that developing countries have the technology and capabilities to take advantage of AIs benefits, including detecting diseases, predicting floods, helping farmers, and training the next generation of workers. The draft recognizes the rapid acceleration of AI development and use and stresses the urgency of achieving global consensus on safe, secure and trustworthy artificial intelligence systems. It also recognizes that the governance of artificial intelligence systems is an evolving area that needs further discussions on possible governance approaches. Big tech companies generally have supported the need to regulate AI, while lobbying to ensure any rules work in their favor. European Union lawmakers gave final approval March 13 to the worlds first comprehensive AI rules, which are on track to take effect by May or June after a few final formalities. Countries around the world, including the U.S. and China, and the Group of 20 major industrialized nations are also moving to draw up AI regulations. And the draft resolution takes note of other U.N. efforts including by Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and the International Telecommunication Union to ensure that AI is used to benefit the world. Sullivan told AP the United States turned to the General Assembly to have a truly global conversation on how to manage the implications of the fast-advancing technology of AI. The U.S. draft resolution encourages all countries, regional and international organizations, tech communities, civil society, the media, academia, research institutions and individuals to develop and support regulatory and governance approaches and frameworks for safe AI systems. It warns against improper or malicious design, development, deployment and use of artificial intelligence systems, such as without adequate safeguards or in a manner inconsistent with international law. A key goal, according to the draft resolution, is to use AI to help spur progress toward achieving the U.N.s badly lagging development goals for 2030, including ending global hunger and poverty, improving health worldwide, ensuring quality secondary education for all children and achieving gender equality. The draft calls on the 193 U.N. member states and others to assist developing countries to access the benefits of digital transformation and safe AI systems. It emphasizes that human rights and fundamental freedoms must be respected, protected and promoted through the life cycle of artificial intelligence systems. The United States began negotiating with all U.N. member nations about three months ago, spent hundreds of hours in direct talks with individual countries and 42 hours in negotiations, and accepted input from 120 nations, a senior U.S. official said. The resolution went through several drafts and achieved consensus support from all member states last week, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly. U.S. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield told AP last week that the resolution aims to build international consensus on a shared approach to the design, development, deployment and use of AI systems, particularly to support the 2030 U.N. goals. If adopted, she said, it will be an historic step forward in fostering safe, security and trustworthy AI worldwide. Source: AP",

Posting on X (formerly Twitter) regarding Sri Lankan authorities and the IMF mission team reaching the staff-level agreement on the second review of the EFF (Extended Fund Facility) programme today (21), he claimed that this reflects the strong progress made by Sri Lanka in key reforms encompassing fiscal consolidation, monetary policy, financial sector stability, and governance, among others. Furthermore, the Finance State Minister mentioned that the signs of a shift from economic stabilisation to growth are emerging as an economic growth of 4.5 was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2023. This is evidence that the reforms implemented over the last 2 years are beginning to bear fruit and it is essential that this reform momentum is maintained, he added. Meanwhile, the lawmaker also highlighted that any slippage or reversal of these reforms threatens to rapidly unwind the economic recovery, and will gravely hinder the well-being of all Sri Lankans, particularly the poor and vulnerable.",

        "date": "March 21, 2024 07:21 pm",
        "content": "Sri Lanka Cricket has denied that they exploited any loopholes after the Wanindu Hasaranga Test ban fiasco has grabbed the headlines in recent times. Hasaranga, who had retired from the longest format of the game in August last year, performed a U-turn and was subsequently selected for the Test series against Bangladesh. However, in a major turn of events, the ICC would slap him with a ban on Tuesday, March 19. This meant that he would be unable to play the series against Bangladesh, but meant that he would be available for the T20 World Cup 2024 and the upcoming season of the IPL with his new franchise, Sunrisers Hyderabad. While there has been speculation among fans and pundits that the Sri Lanka cricket board has exploited a loophole in the ICC rules, the governing body has strongly rejected this claim. The SLC claimed that Hasaranga had informed them via e-mail on March 16 about his desire to play Test matches and said that his fitness levels had improved. Ajantha Mendis, member of the SLC selection committee, went on to state that the call was made well ahead of the third ODI between Sri Lanka and Bangladesh. It was about two weeks ago that he told us he was open to playing Tests again, Mendis told ESPNcricinfo. We know how it looks, but this decision was taken well before the final ODI. Hasaranga was banned by the ICC on Tuesday, March 19 as the all-rounder was found guilty of breaching article 2.8 of the ICC Code of Conduct for Players and Player Support Personnel, which relates to showing dissent at an Umpires decision during an International Match. The all-rounder was punished for his actions during the third ODI against Bangladesh and he was given 3 demerit points. This meant that he would end up having 8 demerit points in the last 24 months. This meant that the amount was converted into 4 suspension points by the ICC. This would mean that Hasaranga could be banned for 2 Tests or 4 ODIs or 4T20Is, whichever comes first. Had the all-rounder not reversed his Test retirement, it would mean that he would miss 4 matches in the upcoming T20 World Cup 2024. If there was no ban for Hasaranga, it would have meant that the all-rounder would have ended up missing the first few matches of the IPL 2024 season. Source: India Today --Agencies",

        "title": "Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar unexpectedly quits",
        "date": "March 21, 2024 09:24 pm",
        "content": "(Reuters) - Leo Varadkar announced on Wednesday he was stepping down as Irelands prime minister in a surprise move, saying the countrys coalition government would stand a better chance of reelection under another leader. Varadkars Fine Gael party will open nominations for a new leader on Thursday with the results to be announced on April 5. Parliament would then vote on that person succeeding Varadkar as prime minister after it returns from Easter recess on April 9. The shock departure of Varadkar, who became the first gay prime minister of the once-staunchly Catholic country in 2017 and returned to the premiership just 15 months ago, does not trigger a general election. A vote must be held by March 2025. My reasons for stepping down are both personal and political, Varadkar, 45, told a hastily arranged news conference at government buildings in Dublin, sounding emotional as he spoke. But after careful consideration, and some soul searching, I believe that a new Taoiseach (prime minister) and a new leader will be better placed than me to achieve (the coalition governments re-election). His successor will have 12 months to try to claw back the wide opinion poll deficit that both Fine Gael and their largest coalition partner Fianna Fail have to the main opposition Sinn Fein party, the former political wing of the Irish Republican Army. Polls suggest the current three-party coalition also stands a chance of being re-elected, though Fine Gael will have to do without around one-third of its sitting lawmakers who have said they will not seek re-election. Bookmaker Paddy Power made 37-year-old Higher Education Minister Simon Harris, who was health minister during the COVID-19 pandemic, the clear favourite to take over from Varadkar. Other contenders include Public Expenditure Minister Paschal Donohoe and Justice Minister Helen McEntee. Enterprise Minister Simon Coveney, a former deputy prime minister who lost to Varadkar in the 2017 leadership election, ruled himself out. In a weighted vote, Fine Gaels 54 lawmakers account for 65 of the electorate, meaning a candidate can quickly gain momentum with the public support of colleagues. The remaining votes are split between party members and local councillors. The problem is that there is no natural stand out, one of the problems of being in power for so long is that all of them come with the baggage of longevity in office, said David Farrell, professor of politics at University College Dublin. Harris probably has the edge. Hes a great communicator and could make a difference in the election. NO POLITICAL PLANS Varadkars government has overseen a sharp economic recovery from the pandemic but has struggled to tackle a decade-long housing crisis and more recently the pressure on services from record numbers of asylum seekers and Ukrainian refugees. He also led Ireland through Brexit talks and the start of the COVID-19 crisis, while Ireland voted to remove a ban on abortion under his leadership. Varadkar announced publicly that he was gay in a radio interview during the 2015 referendum campaign that successfully legalised same-sex marriage. However, he suffered an embarrassing defeat this month when a large majority of voters rejected proposals to replace constitutional references to a mothers duties in the home. The leaders of Varadkars coalition partners said they were surprised when he let them know of his plans at a regular weekly meeting on Tuesday, adding they would both work with his successor to fulfil the governments mandate. A new prime minister, whoever it is, would not change the direction of the coalitions policy programme. A small crowd watched from the gates of government buildings as Varadkar made his announcement. Officials, including one junior minister from the Green Party, looked out of open windows onto the courtyard of government buildings as Varadkar spoke. As recently as last weekend, Varadkar was in Washington where he met U.S. President Joe Biden for St Patricks Day celebrations and talks on subjects including the Israel-Hamas conflict and the BelfastGood Friday Agreement. Varadkar said it was the right time for him to step down, that he had nothing else lined up and that there was no real reason behind his decision. Politicians are human beings. We have our limitations. We give it everything until we cant anymore and then we have to move on, he said. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "date": "March 22, 2024 08:50 am",
        "content": "The United States will ask the U.N. Security Council on Friday to back a resolution calling for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza and an Israel-Hamas hostage deal, increasing pressure on its ally Israel to allow more humanitarian aid and better protect civilians. Nate Evans, spokesperson for the U.S. mission to the United Nations, said on Thursday that the resolution resulted from many rounds of consultations with members of the 15-seat Security Council. The resolution marks a further toughening of Washingtons stance toward Israel. Earlier in the five-month-long war, the U.S. was averse to the word ceasefire and vetoed measures that included calls for an immediate ceasefire. The draft resolution, seen by Reuters, says an immediate and sustained ceasefire lasting roughly six weeks would protect civilians and allow for the delivery of humanitarian assistance. The text backs talks brokered by the U.S., Egypt and Qatar over a ceasefire and emphasizes support for using the period of a truce to intensify efforts in pursuit of lasting peace. The Israeli embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment. To pass in the Security Council, a resolution needs at least nine votes in favor and no veto by the U.S., France, Britain, Russia or China. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Thursday he believed talks in Qatar, which are focused on a six-week truce and the release of 40 Israeli hostages and hundreds of jailed Palestinians, could still reach an agreement. The main sticking point has been that Hamas says it will release hostages only as part of a deal that would end the war, while Israel says it will discuss only a temporary pause. The U.S. has wanted any Security Council support for a ceasefire to be linked to the release of hostages held by Hamas in Gaza. Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7, killing 1,200 people and taking 253 hostages, according to Israeli tallies. Israels offensive has killed almost 32,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza health authorities. The resolution is also intended to deliver a surge in humanitarian aid to Gaza, where severe hunger is worsening. During the war, Washington has vetoed three draft resolutions, two which would have demanded an immediate ceasefire. Most recently, the U.S. justified its veto by saying such council action could jeopardize ceasefire talks. The U.S. traditionally shields Israel at the U.N. But it has also abstained twice, allowing the council to adopt resolutions on increasing aid and calling for extended pauses in fighting. Source: Reuters -Agencies",

Inspector-General of Police (IGP) Deshabandu Tennakoon has decided to award crash prizes to any individual who tip the police off on firearms and organized criminal gang members. In addition, as many as 46 contact numbers were also introduced for the members of the public to provide relevant information. The police also assured to keep informants identities confidential. Thereby, Rs. 500,000 is offered to tip-offs about automatic firearms such as T56, AK47, M16, SAR80 and T81. For information on semi-automatic firearms including 84S, SLR, auto loading shotguns, a cash prize of Rs. 300,000 is offered. Full details of the cash rewards offered by the police are as follows:",

        "title": "Apple lawsuit: US accuses tech giant of monopolising smartphone market",
        "date": "March 22, 2024 09:59 am",
        "content": "The US has filed a landmark lawsuit against Apple, accusing the tech giant of monopolising the smartphone market and crushing competition. In the legal action, the justice department alleges the company abused its control of the iPhone app store to lock in customers and developers. It accuses the firm of taking illegal steps to thwart apps seen as a threat and make rival products less appealing. Apple has vowed to vigorously fight the lawsuit and denies the claims. The sprawling complaint, filed at a federal court in New Jersey along with the attorneys general of 16 states, marks one of the biggest challenges to date for Apple, which has been fending off mounting complaints about its practices in recent years. It alleges that Apple used a series of shapeshifting rules and restricted access to its hardware and software, in a bid to boost its own profits while raising costs for customers and stifling innovation. Apple has maintained monopoly power in the smartphone market not simply by staying ahead of the competition on the merits but by violating federal anti-trust law, Attorney General Merrick Garland said at a press conference announcing the suit. Customers should not have to pay higher prices because companies break the law. The 88-page complaint focuses on five areas where Apple allegedly abused its power. For example, the US alleges that Apple used its app review process to thwart development of so-called super apps and streaming apps, because it was worried such apps would provide less incentive for customers to stick with iPhones. It also says Apple has made it difficult to connect iPhones to smart watches made by rivals and blocked banks and other financial firms from accessing its tap-to-pay technology, allowing Apple to earn billions in fees from processing Apple Pay transactions. The complaint also focuses on the way Apple treats messages sent from rival phones, distinguishing them with green bubbles and limiting videos and other features. It says Apples moves have created social stigma that has helped the tech giant maintain its grip on the market. Apple said customers were loyal because they were happy and that under US law it was free to choose its business partners. It has pointed to privacy and security concerns to justify its rules. The company said it would ask the court to dismiss the lawsuit, which it predicted would fail. We believe this lawsuit is wrong on the facts and the law, and we will vigorously defend against it, the company said. The case will hinge on the question of motivation, said Bill Baer, a visiting fellow at Brookings who was an anti-trust official under the Obama administration. Anti-trust laws and the courts interpretation of them suggest that once youre a monopolist, he said, if you do engage in behaviours that have no legitimate business justification other than to limit competition and cement your monopoly, then that is problematic. It is the third legal action Apple has faced from the US government since 2009 and the first anti-trust challenge filed against the company under President Joe Bidens administration. If the government wins its case, it could force Apple to overhaul its current contracts and practices - or even lead to a break-up of the company. Shares in Apple fell more than 4 as investors digested the implications of the legal battle. Any potential changes would take years to materialise as the case makes its way through the courts. Vanderbilt University professor Rebecca Allensworth called the case a blockbuster, following other lawsuits the justice department has brought against the major tech giants. Google, Meta and Amazon all face similar lawsuits. She said at its core, it was about increasing functionality between smartphones and making the technology and software more accessible to consumers and other businesses. Its not about breaking up Apple into small units or spinning off divisions, she said. Apple has faced a growing legal backlash over its iOS ecosystem and business practices. It is engaged in a lengthy legal battle with Epic Games, which makes Fortnite. Last month, it was fined 1.8bn (1.5bn) by the EU for breaking competition laws over music streaming. The firm had prevented streaming services from informing users of payment options outside the Apple app store, the European Commission said. Competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager said Apple had abused its dominant position in the market for a decade, and ordered the tech giant to remove all of the restrictions. Apple said it would appeal against the decision. Anat Alon-Beck, a business law professor at Case Western Reserve University in Ohio, said the justice departments new lawsuit was far more extensive than its previous legal challenges in the EU. Its not just about the 30 app store fee, but about the core unfair practices of Apple, she said, adding that it was about time that the DOJ took action. Apple systematically excludes rivals from the Apple ecosystem. By doing that, Apple is hurting so many startup businesses, stakeholders, customers and, in my opinion, its shareholders, she said. According to the justice department, Apples share of the US smartphone market exceeds 70, and its share of the broader smartphone market exceeds 65. Source: BBC -Agencies",

        "date": "March 22, 2024 10:25 am",
        "content": "Sri Lanka is close to finalising a debt treatment plan with India and the Paris Club, sources familiar with the negotiations said, pointing to a likely moratorium of up to six years and a reduced interest rate during the repayment period. The discussions are at an advanced stage. A formal agreement on the terms can be expected very soon, the Colombo-based source told The Hindu on Thursday, after a recent discussion among members of the Official Creditor Committee OCC. As many as 17 countries that have extended loans to Sri Lanka formed the Committee last year for ease of debt restructuring negotiations. China opted to stay out of the platform, but has been attending its meetings as an observer. Meanwhile, Colombo has repeatedly assured the OCC that it would negotiate repayment of Chinese loans on comparable terms. Finalising agreements with the official creditors and reaching in principle agreements with the key private creditors would be critical next steps in Sri Lankas economic recovery plan, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) said on Thursday. After defaulting on its nearly US50 billion external debt in April 2022, Sri Lanka has been engaging with its diverse lenders to work out a debt treatment plan that is compatible with its pace of recovery. While Colombo is said to have made considerable progress in negotiating a deal with its bilateral creditors, private creditors holding the largest chunk of Sri Lankas foreign debt continue to pose a challenge. Meanwhile, Sri Lanka got a step closer to receiving the next instalment of the International Monetary Funds (IMF) assistance, as part of the US3 billion package it obtained last year, to recover from the unprecedented financial crash witnessed in the island nation in 2022. Authorities reached a staff-level agreement with the Fund on the second review of its four-year Extended Fund Facility (EFF) arrangement. Upon completion of the IMF Executive Boards review, Sri Lanka would have access to about US337 million, taking IMF assistance it has received so far to US1 billion, the Fund said in a statement. Commending Sri Lankan authorities for making good progress in implementing an ambitious reform agenda, IMF officials told a media gathering in Colombo that the government had shown commendable outcomes, in curtailing inflation, ensuring reserve accumulation, and strengthening public finances.

        "content": "Colombo High Court on Friday (March 22) decided to consider the revision application filed by former Health Minister Keheliya Rambukwella seeking to be released on bail. Accordingly, the revision application has been fixed for consideration on Monday (March 25) by High Court Judge Sujeewa Nissanka. During the court proceedings, Deputy Solicitor General Lakmini Girihagama, representing the Attorney General, told the court that the prosecution has yet to receive the documents pertaining to the revision application. Accordingly, the High Court Judge instructed the petitioning party to provide the prosecution with the relevant documents and ordered that the revision application be taken up on Monday for consideration. Rambukwella, who is in remand custody in connection with the substandard human intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) procurement, submitted his bail application to the Colombo High Court last Friday (March 15) after the Maligakanda Magistrates Court rejected bail for Rambukwella, former health secretary and 4 other accused in the case. Furthermore, the magistrate had ordered them to be remanded in custody until the conclusion of the case under the provisions of the Public Property Act and fixed the case to be recalled on March 28. In his bail application, filed through his legal counsels, Rambukwella claimed that the Maligakanda Magistrates decision to reject bail for him was unlawful. He also sought the High Court to release him on bail subjected to any condition.",

Nevertheless, it has been decided to continue discussions regarding the matter further, since no final agreement was reached between the two parties at yesterdays meeting. It is also understood that a crisis situation has been emerged within the SLPP due to the two contradictory opinions held by the party members regarding the presidential election.

Appearing on behalf of the Attorney General, Senior State Counsel Shaminda Wickrema communicated this to the court when a writ petition filed by Ananda Jayamanna, a former officer of Sri Lanka Army Intelligence Unit, seeking legal action against and prohibition of Mahaviru Day celebrations, was taken up on Thursday (22). The petition was heard before the two-member trial bench consisting of Justices S.U.B. Karaliyadda and Mayadunne Corea. Giving an undertaking before the court previously, the Senior State Counsel, had pledged to take legal action against the Mahaviru Day celebrations held in last November. Thus, when the relevant petition was called yesterday, the attorneys of the petitioning party informed the court that there is no need to maintain this petition further as the prosecution has already given an undertaking. Therefore, they also sought permission to withdraw the relevant petitions. At the time, Senior State Counsel Wickrema revealed that he intends to present to the court a full report on the investigations carried out by the Terrorism Investigation Division (TID) regarding the Mahaviru Day celebrations held so far in the Northern and Eastern provinces. He also requested the court to consider approving the withdrawal of the petition after the report was submitted to the court. Accordingly, the Appellate Court bench, instructing the Senior State Counsel to present the relevant investigation report to the court, ordered that the request to withdraw the petition be considered following the submission of the said report.",

        "date": "March 22, 2024 01:58 pm",
        "content": "The Japanese Ambassador to Sri Lanka, Mizukoshi Hideaki has expressed Japans support for the current program aimed at rebuilding the Sri Lankan economy. Drawing parallels between Japans historical journey and Sri Lankas current economic challenges, the Ambassador highlighted Japans resilience and economic resurgence as a model for Sri Lanka. These remarks were made during his keynote address at a panel discussion on Economic Development and Modernization with Lessons from Japan, chaired by President Ranil Wickremesinghe at the Granbell Hotel in Colombo on Thursday (March 21), organized by the Geopolitical Cartographer. During his keynote speech titled Japans Modernization and Lessons for Sri Lankas Economic Recovery and Governance, the Ambassador shared insights into Japans historical challenges, its adaptation to modern changes, and its journey towards rapid development. The Geopolitical Cartographer is an international research foundation established by President Wickremesinghe, with a primary focus on the Indian Ocean region. Its objective is to conduct research, promote analysis, and study geopolitical, geo-economics, and maritime developments occurring in the Indian Ocean, Pacific Ocean, and the connected landmass. During his address, the Ambassador reflected on the difficult circumstances Japan encountered globally in the aftermath of World War II. He highlighted the pivotal role played by the late former President J.R. Jayewardene, who represented Sri Lanka at the San Francisco Peace Conference. Despite the international communitys widespread condemnation of Japan at that time, President Jayewardenes statement paved the way for Japans eventual reintegration into the international community. The Ambassador expressed gratitude for this significant contribution, which facilitated Japans return to the global stage. The Ambassador also highlighted Japans strategic utilization of this opportunity for reconstruction and economic advancement within its borders. Moreover, he underscored the enduring close relationship between Japan and Sri Lanka, emphasizing the on-going efforts of leaders from both nations to strengthen and enhance bilateral ties. Additionally, he pointed out that Sri Lanka, currently engaged in economic reforms under an International Monetary Fund program, could draw inspiration from Japans experience in overcoming challenges to foster positive transformation within the country. This aligns with Japans example of leveraging adversity to drive progress and development. The Ambassador stressed the significance of nurturing competitive industries akin to those in Japan to propel Sri Lankas economic advancement. He underscored the necessity for Sri Lanka to develop comprehensive industrial policies aimed at fostering competitive export sectors while concurrently striving to attain sustainable development objectives. Ambassador Mizukoshi commended the proactive measures undertaken by the Sri Lankan government in its ongoing anti-corruption initiatives. He expressed Japans commitment to steadfastly supporting these efforts, acknowledging the importance of combating corruption for fostering a conducive environment for economic growth and investment. The Ambassador highlighted Japans commitment to aiding Sri Lankas anti-corruption endeavours by disclosing that Japan has extended financial aid through the United Nations Development Program to bolster the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption in Sri Lanka. Furthermore, he underscored Japans readiness to provide support via institutions like the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) for diverse development initiatives in Sri Lanka. Additionally, he expressed hope for future investment opportunities in Japan to facilitate Sri Lankas economic growth, emphasizing the potential benefits of fostering bilateral economic ties between the two nations. Following the keynote address, Ambassador Mizukoshi, along with Ms. Azusa Kubota, the Resident Representative of the United Nations Development Program in Sri Lanka, and Senior Professor H. D. Karunaratne, Vice Chancellor of Colombo University, gathered in a panel discussion. The discussion, themed Economic Development and Modernization with Lessons from Japan, was moderated by Dr. Ganeshan Wignaraja. Former Speaker Karu Jayasuriya, Members of Parliament Wajira Abeywardana and Kavinda Jayawardena, Central Bank Governor Dr. Nandalal Weerasinghe, Secretary of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Aruni Wijewardena, diplomatic corps, academic personnel, representatives of research institutes, distinguished guests, and others were also in attendance. --PMD",

        "date": "March 22, 2024 02:31 pm",
        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe on Friday (March 22) instructed respective officials to ensure that the national Urumaya freehold deeds program be completed by June. The President emphasized that it is the dream of every citizen to attain legal ownership of land, regardless of their background. He firmly believes that everyone should have this fundamental right. He made these remarks while attending the Urumaya Freehold Deeds program held in the Ottagapulam, in Jaffna. Accordingly, a total of 408 land deeds were granted to the people of Jaffna as part of the Urumaya program, which aims to provide free land rights to 02 million individuals. The president symbolically participated in the awarding of the deeds. Under the leadership of President Wickremesinghe, the release of lands previously utilized by the Jaffna Security Force Headquarters was conducted at the Palaly Air Force Base on Friday morning. Jaffna Commander Major General Chandana Wickramasinghe presented the official land release documents to President Ranil Wickremesinghe. Subsequently, President Wickremesinghe handed over the documents to Jaffna District Governor Maradalingam Pradeepan. As per the arrangement, 234 acres of land from five Grama Niladhari Divisions in the Valikamam North were granted to the local public. These lands are intended for agricultural purposes in alignment with the governments agricultural modernization program. As part of this initiative, seeds were distributed under the leadership of President Ranil Wickremesinghe. Following this distribution, the President engaged in cordial discussions with the land recipients and ceremoniously planted a sapling on the liberated land. During his address at the program for Urumaya Freehold Deeds, President Wickremesinghe made the following remarks: In the era of monarchy, land ownership was vested with the people. However, the enactment of the Waste Lands Act during the British colonial period led to the government assuming ownership of the lands. Consequently, the government came to possess 80 of the countrys land. While the government transferred land rights to individuals through permits, legal ownership was not conferred. It is my conviction that land seized from the people should be restored to them. Hence, we have resolved to grant free land rights to all holders of land permits. Land ownership is a universal aspiration transcending nationality. It is a fundamental right that everyone should possess. To this end, we launched the Urumaya program in Dambulla recently, and today, we are extending this initiative to the Jaffna district. While only a select few are benefiting from this program today, I have instructed for its completion by June. In addition, we have initiated the agriculture modernization program, selecting one Divisional Secretariat in each district for this purpose. In Jaffna, Kopai has been chosen. This initiative aims to modernize agriculture in the province, leading to increased income opportunities for its residents. Following the end of conflict, a significant portion of land was requisitioned by the military. To date, the government has released approximately 63,000 acres of both government-owned and privately-owned land. Furthermore, around 2,600 acres of land previously held by the navy have been returned to the use of civilians. Similarly, 2,600 acres of land, encompassing both government and private holdings, formerly under the control of the Air Force, have been returned. Moreover, recent developments have seen the return of 101 acres of land to local communities, with an additional 234 acres being granted today. Additionally, there have been instances where lands previously categorized as forest conservation areas by the Forest Conservation Department encroached upon village territories. I have instructed that these matters be resolved in accordance with the 1985 land map. Previously, the landowners of this region, in collaboration with the security forces, initiated the Palali Smart Agriculture program. We have advised that these lands be reintegrated into modern agriculture practices, recognizing that landowners may require support in this endeavour. Consequently, the Tri forces are collaborating to provide the necessary assistance. Additionally, contributions from reputable companies are being facilitated for sales while, the initiative receives support from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. Furthermore, specific conditions were stipulated for the allocation of these lands. It is imperative that the best farm in Jaffna be established here, serving as a model farm for the entire nation. Moreover, a new program similar to initiatives in other parts of the north is being launched in Jaffna. We are addressing post-war challenges and have initiated the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC). However, our efforts are not confined to this. We are committed to providing comprehensive solutions to the issues affecting the people and enhancing their sources of income. Consequently, we are spearheading the establishment of a new economy in this province. We have devised plans to bolster agriculture from Vavuniya to Jaffna and harness the extensive solar and wind energy resources in the province. We aim to collaborate with India in this endeavour. Furthermore, we seek to stimulate growth in the tourism and fishing industries. Additionally, land has been designated for investment zones. Over the next 5 to 10 years, we are committed to implementing these initiatives to foster a robust economy in the northern region. I extend an invitation to everyone to collectively contribute to the transformation of Northern Sri Lanka into a significant economic hub. --PMD",

        "title": "Canada to reduce number of temporary residents; first cap set in Sept.",
        "date": "March 22, 2024 02:50 pm",
        "content": "Canada is planning to set limits on the number of temporary residents it lets in for the first time in its history. Immigration minister Marc Miller said on Thursday that the number will be reduced over the next three years, with the first cap to be set in September. It will apply to international students, as well as foreign workers and asylum claimants. The minister has previously spoken about revising immigration targets due to an affordability and housing crisis. In his announcement, Mr Miller said that Canada plans to reduce the number of temporary residents to 5 of the population, down from the current 6.2. He added that the move is to ensure sustainable growth in the number of temporary residents coming into Canada. In recent years, Mr Miller said Canada has seen a sharp increase of temporary residents admitted to the country. As of 2024, the minister said there are a total of 2.5 million temporary residents in Canada. This is up from nearly one million in 2021, according to figures by national data collection agency Statistics Canada. The country relies heavily on temporary foreign workers to fill labour shortages, Mr Miller noted, but said changes are needed to make the system more efficient. It also has international obligations to let in those who are fleeing war and political prosecution. To be clear, these are important global commitments to Canadians, Mr Miller said. At the same time, there should be an honest conversation about what the rise of international migration means for Canada as we plan ahead. As part of the new policy, officials said some Canadian businesses will have to reduce the number of temporary foreign workers they rely on by 1 May, and will have a shorter window to prove that these jobs could not be filled by a permanent resident or a Canadian citizen. Two exceptions to the rule will be workers in the construction and healthcare sectors - both of which are facing labour shortages in Canada. These workers will be allowed to enter the country at current levels until at least 31 August. According to Statistics Canada, the majority of temporary residents - around 40 - in 2021 had a work permit. Students represented 22 of temporary residents, and asylum claimants accounted for 18. Others had a combination of permits - either study and visa, or are family members of temporary residents. Thursdays announcement was criticised by advocates for temporary foreign workers, who told Canadian news outlet Global News that migrants work under precarious conditions and have been scapegoated for the affordability and housing crisis. It comes as Canada reinstated visa requirements for Mexican nationals due to a surge of asylum seekers from Mexico. Earlier this year, Mr Miller also set a limit on the number of international students admitted to Canada for the next two years, resulting in a planned decrease of 35 in approved study permits. Over 800,000 foreign students were in Canada in 2022, up from 214,000 a decade earlier. That move has also been criticised, namely by some post-secondary institutions across the country, who said they worry that it will deter students from coming to Canada and drive them to study elsewhere. Some universities said a cap would mean a loss of revenue for their institutions. The caps represent a significant shift in policy for Canada, which has historically relied on open immigration to fill job vacancies and address its rapidly-aging workforce. They come as the Trudeau government faces growing pressure to address an increasingly unaffordable housing market. Home prices in Canada now average C700,000 (517,400; 408,750) and rent for Canadians has risen 22 in the last two years. Source: BBC -Agencies",

        "content": "Former President Maithripala Sirisena claims he is aware of the true mastermind of the 2019 Easter Sunday terror attacks and that he is prepared to disclose the information to the judiciary if inquired from him or issues an order regarding the matter. Commenting to the media in Kandy today (March 22), Sirisena highlighted that he is ready to disclose the relevant information and that at the same time, it is the responsibility of the judges to keep the information strictly confidential. Speaking further he said, I have more pain in my heart than frustration. I ran for the election as a common candidate in 2015 with the intention of elevating this country to a truly commendable position. However, I did not receive the opportunity to implement the relevant programs. Neither the ruling party nor the opposition supported me. The 19th Amendment stripped away the powers vested in me, which I willingly relinquished. However, I did not anticipate that those who assume power would misuse it. Consequently, both the government and the opposition attacked me, he added. Next came the Easter attacks. On the other hand, no one has disclosed who truly perpetrated the Easter Sunday attacks. I am aware of them. If the court requests or issues an order regarding the matter, I am prepared to reveal their identities. Additionally, it is the responsibility of the judges to maintain confidentiality in this matter, the ex-president expressed.",

        "title": "Sri Lankas export earnings record modest increase in February",
        "date": "March 22, 2024 08:50 pm",
        "content": "The merchandise export performance in February 2024 amounted to US 983.7 million, recording a modest increase of 0.17  compared to February 2023, the Export Development Board (EDB) says. In addition, export performance in February 2024 increased by 1.3 compared to the preceding month, January 2024. Compared to February 2023, agricultural exports have shown a significant increase of 11.82 , reaching US 255.76 million in February 2024. However, industrial exports experienced a decline of 3.36  during the same period, dropping to US 727.94 million. The cumulative merchandise exports from January to February 2024 decreased by 0.30  to US 1,954.39 million compared to the corresponding period in 2023. With respect to Sri Lankas performance in its top 15 major export markets, the EDB said the UK, Germany, the Netherlands and France have shown positive growth in both February 2024 and the cumulative period of January to February 2024 compared to the corresponding periods in 2023. The USA has continued as a key export destination for Sri Lanka, absorbing 23 of the islands merchandise exports in 2024. The exports to Sri Lankas single largest export destination increased by 8.02  to US 249.6 million in February 2024 compared to February 2023. However, exports to the USA in the cumulative period of January - February 2024 decreased by 3.24 to US 470.07 million compared to the corresponding periods in 2023. Additionally, exports to the UK increased by 20.49  to US 82.93 million in February 2024 compared to the corresponding month in 2023. Meanwhile, exports to the UK increased by 2.87  to US 150.45 million in the cumulative period of January to February 2024 compared to the corresponding period in 2023. In February 2024, exports to Sri Lankas Free Trade Agreement (FTA) partners India and Pakistan constituted 6.5 of the total merchandise exports, and experienced a notable 18.18  decrease to reach US 61.28 million, compared to February 2023. Further, exports to India saw a decrease of 20.56  whereas exports to Pakistan went up by 17.02  in February 2024 compared to February 2023. The EDB attributed the negative performance of India to lower exports of cloves (-96.79) and petroleum oil (-92.7), and Pakistans positive performance to increased exports of other textile articles. With respect to Sri Lankas performance in regions, the EDB said exports to the European Union (EU), which accounts for 24 of Sri Lankas exports, increased during both February 2024 and the cumulative period of January - February 2024 by 5.64  and 1.26, respectively. Exports to the top five EU markets were recorded as; Germany US 102.01 million (increased by 3.45 ), Italy US 100.53 million (increased by 0.25 ), the Netherlands US 55.64 million (increased by 2.85 ), France US 38.63 million (increased by 9.68 ) and Belgium US 35.11 million (decreased by 6.02 ) during the cumulative period of January to February 2024 in comparison to the corresponding period in 2023.",

According to the amendments made to the Penal Code in 1995, even if a victim under 16 years of age has sexual relations of their own free will, it is considered rape. However, the proposed new amendment to the Penal Code by the Justice Minister will lower the age of sexual consent to 14 years.

        "title": "Russia launches massive air attack on Ukraines energy infrastructure",
        "date": "March 22, 2024 11:25 pm",
        "content": "Russia launched one of its biggest missile and drone barrages on Ukraines energy infrastructure overnight into Friday since the start of its full-scale invasion more than two years ago. Ukrainian officials said at least 10 of the countrys regions were struck in an attack targeting power supplies in multiple towns and cities, including Kharkiv in the east, Odesa on the coast and Kryvyi Rih in the center. The attacks have left well over 1 million households without electricity Friday morning, according to reports from multiple regional authorities. Only Kyiv and the northwest of the country were spared. Russias Defense Ministry said it had launched a massive strike on Ukraines military-industrial complex in response to recent strikes on Russias territory. Ukraines military  as well as pro-Ukrainian groups of Russian fighters  have this month targeted Russias border regions of Belgorod and Kursk, forcing schools to close and residents to evacuate. All the goals of the massive strike have been achieved, the ministry said. Among the major targets was Ukraines largest hydroelectric power complex, situated on the Dnipro river in the southern Zaporizhzhia region. Ihor Syrota, chief executive of Ukrhydroenergo, the sites operator, said both electricity generating plants there had suffered massive damage and that it was unclear when or if the plants would be able to resume operations. The dam itself was currently not in danger of being breached, however, after workers opened the dams gates to allow water to flow downriver, another senior Ukrainian energy executive, Volodymyr Kudrytskyi, told national television. Kudrytskyi said the missile and drone barrage was likely the largest-ever single attack on Ukraines energy system. The energy company operating in Dnipropetrovsk region, DTEK, said more than 1,000 miners were working underground when coal mines in the region lost power due to the strike. The miners were evacuated above ground and no one was injured, DTEK said, adding that coal production would resume once the mines had been repaired. At least three people were killed in the nationwide strikes, with two reported dead in Khmelnytskyi region, in western Ukraine, and one in Zaporizhzhia. Several people are reported missing and more than a dozen have been injured. Mykola Oleshchuk, commander of Ukraines air force, said 151 missiles and drones had been launched, including 12 Iskander M ballistic missiles, 7 Kinzhal (Kh-47M2) ballistic missiles and 5 Kh-22 cruise missiles. Over two years of war, these missile types have proven among the hardest for Ukraines air defenses to shoot down. According to Oleshchuk, all 24 of these missiles evaded attempts to intercept them. Elsewhere, the air force commander said 63 Shahed drones had been fired, of which 55 were intercepted. He said 40 cruise missiles of type Kh-101Kh-555 were launched, of which 35 were shot down, while two Kh-59 guided missiles were launched and intercepted. Finally, 22 S-300 and S-400 missile types  originally designed as anti-aircraft interceptors but commonly used by Russia as attack weapons  were also fired. These are usually left alone by air defense systems because the possible interception time is too short. Fridays attack came a day after Kyiv was struck with a salvo of 31 missiles, in an attack targeting facilities belonging to the Defense Intelligence Directorate, a Ukrainian source told CNN. That strike included just two ballistic missiles, possibly North Korean-made. All 31 missiles fired were intercepted, officials said. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky posted a video on Telegram showing firefighters responding at one of the badly damaged energy facilities, and issued a plea to his allies to provide Ukraine with more support. Russian missiles do not suffer delays in the way aid packages to our country do. Shahed drones are not affected by indecision like some politicians are, Zelensky said. Our partners know exactly what is needed. They can definitely support us. We need these solutions. Life must be protected from these non-humans from Moscow, he said, adding that Kharkiv and Zaporizhzhia in particular needed US-made Patriot air defense systems. For months, Republicans in the US House of Representatives have blocked a military aid package valued at 60 billion, as the issue of support for Ukraine has become embroiled in the political debate surrounding Donald Trumps campaign to regain the presidency. US President Joe Bidens national security adviser Jake Sullivan visited Kyiv on Wednesday and insisted he remained confident the House would eventually pass a new assistance package, though he could not say when he thought this might happen.

        "title": "40 killed and more than 100 wounded in attack on Moscow concert hall",
        "date": "March 23, 2024 12:56 am",
        "content": "UPDATED (1.00 a.m.) - Russias Federal Security Service said 40 people died and more than 100 were wounded in an attack Friday at a Moscow concert hall. The attack, which Russian authorities are investigating as terrorism, is the deadliest in Russia in recent years. Several gunmen burst into the concert hall on the edge of Moscow and sprayed visitors with automatic gunfire, killing and wounding dozens and starting a massive blaze. The attack comes days after President Vladimir Putin cemented his grip on the country in a highly orchestrated electoral landslide. At least a dozen people have been killed and many others wounded in what is being described as the most severe terrorist attack in Russia in last two decades as gunmen dressed in combat fatigues entered a large concert hall in Moscow, opening fire and detonating explosives. But at least 18 people have been killed and 43 wounded in a shooting incident at the Crocus City Hall concert venue near Moscow, Russian media outlet Baza reported. Eyewitnesses reported that as many as five terrorists, clad in camouflage clothing, unleashed gunfire from automatic weapons at attendees inside the Crocus City Hall music venue near Moscow. Video footage captured the chaos and panic as the assailants carried out their attack. The exact number of casualties and injuries remains unclear, as does the identity of the perpetrators. However, Russian news agencies have reported that 70 ambulance crews have been dispatched to the scene to attend to the wounded and transport them to medical facilities for treatment. There were no immediate claims of responsibility for the raid, the worst terror attack in Russia in two decades that came as the fighting in Ukraine dragged into a third year. Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin described the attack as a huge tragedy. Russian news reports said that the assailants threw explosives, triggering a massive blaze at the Crocus City Hall on the western edge of Moscow. Video posted on social media showed huge plumes of black smoke rising over the building. White House National Security Advisor John Kirby said Friday that he couldnt yet speak about all the details but that the images are just horrible. And just hard to watch. Our thoughts are going to be with the victims of this terrible, terrible shooting attack, Kirby said. There are some moms and dads and brothers and sisters and sons and daughters who havent gotten the news yet. This is going to be a tough day. The attack took place as crowds gathered for a concert of Picnic, a famed Russian rock band, at the hall that can accommodate over 6,000 people. Russian news reports said that visitors were being evacuated, but some said that an unspecified number of people could have been trapped by the blaze. Russias state RIA Novosti news agency reported that at least three people in combat fatigues fired weapons. The state Tass news agency also reported the shooting. Extended rounds of gunfire could be heard on multiple videos posted by Russian media and Telegram channels. One showed two men with rifles moving through the mall. Another one showed a man inside the auditorium, saying the assailants set it on fire, as gunshots rang out incessantly in the background. More videos showed up to four attackers, armed with assault rifles and wearing caps, who were shooting screaming people at point-blank range. Andrei Vorobyov, the governor of the Moscow region, said he was heading to the area and set up a task force to deal with the damage. He didnt immediately offer any further details. Russian media reports said that riot police units were being sent to the area as people were being evacuated. The attack followed a statement issued earlier this month by the U.S. Embassy in Moscow that urged the Americans to avoid crowded places in the Russian capital in view of an imminent attack, a warning that was repeated by several other Western embassies. Russian President Vladimir Putin, who extended his grip on Russia for another six years in the March 15-17 presidential vote after a sweeping crackdown on dissent, earlier this week denounced the Western warnings as an attempt to intimidate Russians. --Agencies",

        "title": "Islamic State claims responsibility for Moscow concert venue attack that killed at least 60",
        "date": "March 23, 2024 06:24 am",
        "content": "Camouflage-clad gunmen opened fire at concertgoers with automatic weapons on Friday, killing at least 60 people and injuring 145 more in an attack claimed by Islamic State militants. In the deadliest attack in Russia since the 2004 Beslan school siege, gunmen sprayed civilians with bullets just before Soviet-era rock group Picnic was to perform to a full house at the 6,200-seat the Crocus City Hall just west of Moscow. Verified video showed people taking their seats in the hall, then rushing for the exits as repeated gunfire echoed above screams. Other video showed men shooting at groups of people. Some victims lay motionless in pools of blood. Suddenly there were bangs behind us - shots. A burst of firing - I do not know what, one witness, who asked not to be identified by name, told Reuters. A stampede began. Everyone ran to the escalator, the witness said. Everyone was screaming; everyone was running. Russian investigators said the death toll was more than 60. Health officials said about 145 people were wounded, of which about 60 were in critical condition. In the 2004 Beslan school siege, Islamist militants took more than 1,000 people, including hundreds of children, hostage. Russian President Vladimir Putin was being updated by security chiefs about the situation, including from Alexander Bortnikov, the head of the Federal Security Service (FSB), the Kremlin said. Russian investigators published pictures of a Kalashnikov automatic weapon, vests with multiple spare magazines and bags of spent bullet casings. ISLAMIC STATE Islamic State, the militant group that once sought control over swathes of Iraq and Syria, claimed responsibility for the attack, the groups Amaq agency said on Telegram. A grainy picture was published by some Russian media of two of the alleged attackers in a white car. The fate of the attackers was unclear as firefighters battled a massive blaze and emergency services evacuated hundreds of people while parts of the venues roof collapsed. Islamic State said its fighters attacked on the outskirts of Moscow, killing and wounding hundreds and causing great destruction to the place before they withdrew to their bases safely. The statement gave no further detail. The United States has intelligence confirming Islamic States claim of responsibility for the shooting, a U.S. official said on Friday. The official said Washington had warned Moscow in recent weeks of the possibility of an attack. We did warn the Russians appropriately, said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity, without providing any additional details. Russia has yet to say who it thinks is responsible. The attack on Crocus City Hall, about 20 km (12 miles) from the Kremlin, comes just two weeks after the U.S. embassy in Russia warned that extremists had imminent plans for an attack in Moscow. Hours before the embassy warning, the FSB said it had foiled an attack on a Moscow synagogue by Islamic States affiliate in Afghanistan, known as ISIS-Khorasan or ISIS-K, and seeks a caliphate across Afghanistan, Pakistan, Turkmenistan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and Iran. Putin changed the course of the Syrian civil war by intervening in 2015, supporting President Bashar al-Assad against the opposition and Islamic State. ISIS-K has been fixated on Russia for the past two years, frequently criticizing Putin in its propaganda, said Colin Clarke of the Soufan Center. The broader Islamic State group has claimed deadly attacks across the Middle East, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iran, Europe, the Philippines and Sri Lanka. Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said it was a bloody terrorist attack that the entire world should condemn. The United States, European and Arab powers and many former Soviet republics expressed shock and sent their condolences. Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak denied any Ukrainian involvement. The United Nations Security Council condemned what it called a heinous and cowardly terrorist attack. SECURITY TIGHTENED Russia tightened security at airports, transport hubs and across the capital - a vast urban area of over 21 million people. All large-scale public events were cancelled across the country. Putin, who was on Sunday re-elected for a new six-year term, sent thousands of troops into Ukraine in 2022 and has repeatedly warned that various powers - including countries in the West - are seeking to sow chaos inside Russia. Putin was informed in the first minutes of the attack and is regularly being updated, the Kremlin said. The president constantly receives information about what is happening and about the measures being taken through all relevant services. The head of state gave all the necessary instructions, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said. At Crocus City Hall, flames leapt into the sky, and plumes of black smoke rose above the venue as hundreds of blue lights from emergency vehicles flashed in the night. Helicopters sought to douse flames that engulfed the large building. The roof of the venue was collapsing, state news agency RIA said. A terrible tragedy occurred in the shopping centre Crocus City today, Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin said. I am sorry for the loved ones of the victims. Source: Reuters -Agencies",

        "title": "Princess of Wales reveals she has cancer and is undergoing chemotherapy",
        "date": "March 23, 2024 07:25 am",
        "content": "Kate, the Princess of Wales, has cancer and is undergoing chemotherapy, she revealed Friday in a stunning announcement that followed weeks of speculation about her health and whereabouts. The princess disclosed her condition in a video message recorded Wednesday in Windsor and broadcast Friday. It came after relentless speculation on social media ever since January, when she was hospitalized for unspecified abdominal surgery. Kate asked for time, space and privacy while she is treated for an unspecified type of cancer that was discovered after what she described as major surgery. Wearing a casual striped sweater and jeans, Kate sat on a wooden bench in front of a lawn dotted with daffodils. The flowers, which bloom in early spring, are often used as a symbol of hope for people fighting cancer. I am well, she said. I am getting stronger every day by focusing on the things that will help me heal. Kate, 42, hadnt been seen publicly since Christmas until video surfaced this week of her with her husband, Prince William, heir to the throne. It showed them walking from a shop that sells produce grown on the royal familys Windsor estate. The news is another jolt for the royal family since the announcement last month that King Charles III was being treated for an unspecified type of cancer that was discovered while undergoing a procedure for a benign enlarged prostate. Charles said he is so proud of Catherine for her courage in speaking as she did, according to a statement released by Buckingham Palace. The king, who received prostate treatment in the same hospital and at the same time Kate had her surgery, remained in the closest contact with his beloved daughter-in-law in the past weeks. The king and Queen Camilla will continue to offer their love and support to the whole family through this difficult time, the palace said. Prince Harry and his wife Meghan, who have been estranged from William and Kate since their move to California in 2020, wished the princess well. We wish health and healing for Kate and the family, and hope they are able to do so privately and in peace, they said in a statement. Before Friday, Kensington Palace had given little detail about Kates condition beyond saying it wasnt cancer-related, the surgery was successful and recuperation would keep the princess away from public duties until April. Kate said it had been thought that her condition was non-cancerous until post-surgery tests revealed the diagnosis. This of course came as a huge shock, and William and I have been doing everything we can to process and manage this privately for the sake of our young family, she said. By choosing to speak directly to the country and the world about her condition, rather than issuing a statement through the palace, Kate offered a level of intimacy and transparency atypical of a member of the royal family and may help tamp down runaway conjecture. The kings disclosure of his condition was also notably open by royal standards. Kate said it had taken her time to recover from the surgery before starting preventative treatment, which she said was in the early stages. Dr. Shivan Sivakumar, associate professor in oncology at the University of Birmingham, said its unclear what the princess meant by preventative chemotherapy but he presumed that its what is known as adjuvant chemotherapy in the medical profession. This is chemotherapy after an operation to prevent recurrence, he said. This is to attempt to destroy any circulating cancer cells. Kate said it has been an incredibly tough couple of months for her family. She said it had taken time to tell her three children Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis in a way appropriate for them and reassure them she will be OK. The announcement came after the start of the Easter holidays, which will shield the children from media coverage of the news. British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said in a statement that Kate has shown tremendous bravery. We are incredibly sad to hear of the news, said White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre, who opened her briefing with reporters moments after news of cancer treatment broke. We are taking this in, this terrible news, as all of you are. Charles, 75, has withdrawn from public duties while he has cancer treatment, though hes appeared frequently in photos carrying on meetings with government officials and dignitaries and was even seen going to church. Kate, on the other hand, had been out of view instead of appearing at charity events and promoting causes such as supporting children early in life, leading to weeks of speculation and gossip. Attempts to put rumors to bed by releasing a photo of her on Mothers Day in the U.K. surrounded by her three smiling children backfired when The Associated Press and other news agencies retracted the image because it had been manipulated. Kate issued a statement the next day acknowledging she liked to experiment with editing and apologizing for any confusion the photo had caused. But that did little to quell the speculation. Even the footage published by The Sun and TMZ that appeared to show Kate and William shopping sparked a new flurry of rumor-mongering, with some armchair sleuths refusing to believe the video showed Kate at all. Earlier this week, a British privacy watchdog said it was investigating a report that staff at the private London hospital where she was treated tried to snoop on her medical records while she was a patient for abdominal surgery. The former Kate Middleton, who married William in a fairy-tale wedding in 2011, has boosted the popularity and appeal of the British monarchy worldwide more than any royal since Princess Diana. The princess is the oldest of three children brought up in a well-to-do neighborhood in Berkshire, west of London. The Middletons have no aristocratic background, and the British press often referred to Kate as a commoner marrying into royalty. Her brother James Middleton posted on Instagram: Over the years, we have climbed many mountains together. As a family, we will climb this one with you too. Kate attended the private school Marlborough College and then University of St. Andrews in Scotland, where she met William around 2001. Friends and housemates at first, their relationship became widely publicized when they were pictured together on a skiing holiday in Switzerland in 2004. Kate graduated in 2005 with a degree in art history and a budding relationship with the prince. Source: Associated Press -Agencies",

        "title": "Sri Lanka to issue on-arrival driving licenses to foreigners starting April 15",
        "date": "March 23, 2024 08:45 am",
        "content": "State Minister of Transport Lasantha Alagiyawanna revealed that foreign individuals seeking a driving license in Sri Lanka will have the convenience of applying for it directly at the airport from April 15. Upon exiting the airport, they will be able to obtain their drivers license swiftly and efficiently. The State Minister mentioned that the program to provide compensation to road accident victims promptly without judicial action was also started on March 01. The individuals can claim a maximum compensation amount of up to Rs. 500, 000 by submitting an application to the relevant insurance company within one year of the accident. This compensation can be availed from any branch of the insurance company across the island, he explained. Addressing a press briefing titled Collective Path to a Stable Country held at the Presidential Media Centre (PMC) on Friday (22), Alagiyawanna further commented: Under the directives of President Ranil Wickremesinghe, various projects were executed to curb road accidents. It was acknowledged that road accident victims encounter numerous difficulties. Consequently, following extensive discussions between the Insurance Regulatory Commission of Sri Lanka and insurance companies, a program was initiated on March 01st to expedite compensation without legal proceedings. This compensation mechanism is effective from March 01st onwards and does not apply retroactively to past incidents. Accordingly, individuals can obtain a maximum compensation amount of up to Rs. 500, 000 from any branch of the relevant insurance company across the island by submitting an application within one year of the accident. However, if a victim seeks more than the maximum compensation, they must pursue legal action through court proceedings. The Sri Lanka Police and Divisional Secretaries have briefed Grama Niladhari Officers about this procedure. In collaboration with the Department of Immigration and Emigration, the Civil Aviation Authority and the Ministry of Tourism, arrangements are being made to obtain a driving license in Sri Lanka for foreigners seeking to have them. They can now apply for it directly at the airport from April 15th. All necessary arrangements have been made to facilitate the issuance of the driving license upon their departure from the airport. The fees for obtaining a driving license are as follows: USD 25 for one month, USD 50 for three months, USD 75 for six months, and USD 200 for a year or longer. Additionally, starting from April 10th until the demerit points system takes effect; post offices handling traffic violation fines will transmit details such as the nature of offences, the respective police station, driving license particulars, and contact number to the National Council for Road Safetys data system. Using this information, the National Council for Road Safety will send text messages and accident-related videos to the relevant phone numbers through WhatsApp. It has been acknowledged that promoting awareness to reduce traffic accidents must begin at the school level. As a result, the Ministry of Education, Ministry of Transport, and Ministry of Public Security will collaboratively launch road safety forums in every school from April 03rd. Additionally, a plan has been devised to reward school students with medals at different grade levels based on their involvement in practical activities, leading up to the Presidents medal. Furthermore, it is anticipated that recipients of the Presidential Medal will be exempt from the written exam when applying for driving licenses. We also aim to set up road safety forums within the colleges of education and implement similar initiatives. Additionally, we have made provisions for raising awareness about road accidents and traffic rules at preschools by providing the necessary facilities. The National Council for Road Safety was founded in 1998, but its legal authority is deemed inadequate for addressing present-day challenges. In response, Transport Minister Bandula Gunawardena has endeavoured to secure Cabinet approval to elevate the National Council for Road Safety to a Commission. This move is anticipated to be presented to Parliament shortly for the necessary approval. --PMD",

        "title": "Russia, China veto US resolution calling for immediate cease-fire in Gaza",
        "date": "March 23, 2024 10:08 am",
        "content": "Russia and China on Friday vetoed a U.S.-sponsored United Nations resolution supporting an immediate and sustained cease-fire in the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza, calling the measure ambiguous and saying it was not the direct demand to end the fighting that much of the world seeks. The vote in the Security Council became another showdown involving world powers that are locked in tense disputes elsewhere, with the United States taking criticism for not being tough enough against its ally Israel, whose ongoing military offensive has created a dire humanitarian crisis for the 2.3 million Palestinians in Gaza. A key issue was the unusual language that said the Security Council determines the imperative of an immediate and sustained cease-fire. The phrasing was not a straightforward demand or call to halt hostilities. The resolution reflected a shift by the United States, which has found itself at odds with much of the world as even allies of Israel push for an unconditional end to fighting. In previous resolutions, the U.S. has closely intertwined calls for a cease-fire with demands for the release of Israeli hostages in Gaza. This resolution, using wording thats open to interpretation, continued to link the two issues, but not as firmly. Before the vote, Russian U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia said Moscow supports an immediate cease-fire, but he criticized the diluted language, which he called philosophical wording that does not belong in a U.N. resolution. He accused U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and U.S. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield of deliberately misleading the international community. This was some kind of an empty rhetorical exercise, Nebenzia said. The American product is exceedingly politicized, the sole purpose of which is to help to play to the voters, to throw them a bone in the form of some kind of a mention of a cease-fire in Gaza  and to ensure the impunity of Israel, whose crimes in the draft are not even assessed. Chinas U.N. ambassador, Zhang Jun, said the U.S. proposal set preconditions and fell far short of expectations of council members and the broader international community. If the U.S. was serious about a cease-fire, it wouldnt have vetoed time and again multiple council resolutions, he said. It wouldnt have taken such a detour and played a game of words while being ambiguous and evasive on critical issues. The U.S. has vetoed three resolutions demanding a cease-fire, the most recent an Arab-backed measure supported by 13 council members with one abstention on Feb. 20. Thomas-Greenfield urged the council to adopt the resolution to press for an immediate cease-fire and the release of the hostages, as well as to address Gazas humanitarian crisis and support ongoing diplomacy by the United States, Egypt and Qatar. The vote in the 15-member council was 11 members in favor and three against, including Algeria, the Arab representative on the council. There was one abstention, from Guyana. After the vote, Thomas-Greenfield accused Russia and China of voting for deeply cynical reasons, saying they could not bring themselves to condemn Hamas terrorist attacks in southern Israel on Oct. 7, which the resolution would have done for the first time. She accused Russia of again putting politics over progress and having the audacity and hypocrisy to throw stones after launching its unwarranted invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. At the White House, national security spokesman John Kirby said Russia and China would rather shoot down something we authored simply because we authored it. While the most recent resolution would have been officially binding under international law, it would not have ended the fighting or led to the release of hostages. But it would have added to the pressure on Israel amid global demands for a cease-fire at a time of rising tensions between the U.S. and Israeli governments. Meanwhile, the 10 elected members of the Security Council have put their own resolution in a final form. It demands an immediate humanitarian cease-fire for the Muslim holy month of Ramadan that began March 10 to be respected by all parties leading to a permanent sustainable cease-fire. The Palestinian U.N. ambassador said the vote would take place Saturday morning. The resolution also demands the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages  and emphasizes the urgent need to protect civilians and deliver humanitarian aid throughout the Gaza Strip. The Russian, Chinese and Algerian ambassadors urged council members to support it, but Thomas-Greenfield said the texts current form fails to support sensitive diplomacy in the region. Worse, it could actually give Hamas an excuse to walk away from the deal on the table. The Security Council had already adopted two resolutions on the worsening humanitarian situation in Gaza, but none has called for a cease-fire. Russia and China vetoed a U.S.-sponsored resolution in late October calling for pauses in the fighting to deliver aid, protection of civilians and a halt to arming Hamas. They said it did not reflect global calls for a cease-fire. A day earlier, the U.S. circulated a rival resolution, which went through major changes during negotiations before Fridays vote. It initially would have supported a temporary cease-fire linked to the release of all hostages, and the previous draft would have supported international efforts for a cease-fire as part of a hostage deal. The vote took place as Blinken, Americas top diplomat, was on his sixth mission to the Middle East since the war began, discussing a deal for a cease-fire and hostage release, as well as post-war scenarios. Palestinian militants killed some 1,200 people in the surprise Oct. 7 attack into southern Israel that triggered the war, and they abducted another 250 people. Hamas is still believed to be holding some 100 people hostage, as well as the remains of 30 others. In Gaza, the Health Ministry raised the death toll in the territory Thursday to nearly 32,000 Palestinians. The agency does not differentiate between civilians and combatants in its count but says women and children make up two-thirds of the dead. A report from an international authority on hunger warned this week that famine is imminent in northern Gaza and that escalation of the war could push half of the territorys population to the brink of starvation. Israel faces mounting pressure to streamline the entry of aid into the Gaza Strip, to open more land crossings and to come to a cease-fire agreement. But Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to move the military offensive to the southern city of Rafah, where some 1.3 million displaced Palestinians have sought safety. Netanyahu says its a Hamas stronghold. The final U.S. resolution eliminated language in the initial draft that said Israels offensive in Rafah should not proceed under current circumstances. Instead, in an introductory paragraph, the council emphasized its concern that a ground offensive into Rafah would result in further harm to civilians and their further displacement, potentially into neighboring countries, and would have serious implications for regional peace and security. Chinas Zhang criticized the backtracking on unequivocal U.S. opposition, saying it would send an utterly wrong signal and lead to severe consequences. Source: Associated Press (AP) -Agencies",

        "date": "March 23, 2024 11:30 am",
        "content": "Tamil Nadu Chief Minister MK Stalin on Friday wrote to Indias External Affairs Minister Dr. S. Jaishankar, urging him to secure the immediate release of all detained fishermen and their fishing boats in Sri Lanka and ensure necessary legal assistance for them. In a letter to Jaishankar, Stalin said there were multiple occurrences of fishermen from India being detained by Sri Lankan authorities, which caused distress and uncertainty among their families. He said 32 fishermen from Tamil Nadu were caught by the Sri Lankan Navy on March 21 and their five mechanised boats were seized. Decisive action must be taken without any further delay to address this festering issue and to ensure the safety and well-being of the affected fishermen. Further legal assistance needs to be provided for the fishermen who have been sentenced by Sri Lankan courts, he said. Therefore, I urge you to secure the immediate release of all our fishermen and their boats and also to ensure necessary legal assistance to the fishermen arrested by Sri Lanka, he said. There have been periodic instances of Indian fishermen being detained by Sri Lankan authorities for allegedly crossing the International Maritime Boundary Line and fishing in Sri Lankan waters. The majority of these detentions take place in the Palk Strait, a narrow strip of water between Tamil Nadu and northern Sri Lanka. The strait is a rich fishing ground for fishermen from both countries. According to the Centre, 240 Indian fishermen were arrested in Sri Lankan waters and 35 trawlers were seized last year.

        "title": "2.2 billion people worldwide lack access to clean drinking water: UN report",
        "date": "March 23, 2024 12:12 pm",
        "content": "Increasing global water scarcity is fuelling more conflicts and contributing to instability, the United Nations warns in a new report, which says access to clean water is critical to promoting peace. The UN World Water Development Report 2024, released on Friday, said 2.2 billion people worldwide have no access to clean drinking water and 3.5 billion people lack access to safely managed sanitation. Girls and women are the first victims of a lack of water, said the report, published by the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), especially in rural areas where they have the primary responsibility of collecting supplies. Spending several hours a day on fetching water, coupled with a lack of safe sanitation, is a contributing factor to girls dropping out of school. Water shortages not only fan the flames of geopolitical tensions but also pose a threat to fundamental rights as a whole, for example, by considerably undermining the position of girls and women, UNESCO chief Audrey Azoulay said. While the report did not examine specific current conflicts, Israel has severely restricted access to fresh, clean water during its war on Gaza. UN agencies have long warned that not only are children and women at grave risk of thirst and starvation, but the lack of clean water also has disrupted medical treatment and hygiene. The lack of water security drives migration, and displaced people strain resources in locations where they settle. The report cited a study in Somalia that indicated a 200 percent increase in gender-based violence against a group of displaced people. At least 10 percent of global migration is linked to water stress as the world faces a more erratic climate, the researchers found. The report also said: Global warming is projected to  further increase the frequency and severity of droughts and floods, with more wet and very dry weather and climate events. Titled Water for Prosperity and Peace, the report found that roughly half of the worlds population is experiencing severe water scarcity with some areas lacking water almost year-round. Much of the consequences are felt in poorer countries, which find it harder to adapt. The report estimated that it would cost 114bn annually to provide safe drinking water, sanitation and hygiene in 140 low- to middle-income countries. Quentin Graft from Water Justice Hub, a UNESCO affiliate, told Al Jazeera: Its not just a water problem for people in Syria. Its not just a water problem for people in Sudan.  Its a water problem for all of us because we grow our food with freshwater whether its irrigated or whether its rain-fed, and when you have climate change on top of an already existing water crisis, then we have an inability to feed ourselves. While 153 countries share water resources, only 24 have signed onto cooperation agreements covering all of their shared water, UN chief Antonio Guterres said in a statement marking World Water Day on Friday. More than 60 percent of all freshwater resources are shared by two or more countries, including major rivers like the Rhine and Danube in Europe, the Mekong in Asia, the Nile in Africa and the Amazon in South America, Sonja Koeppel, secretary of the UN Water Convention, told the Agence France-Presse news agency. The convention was established in 1992 to help foster responsible joint management of water resources in Europe but opened up in 2016 to countries around the world. It currently has 52 state parties, mainly in Europe, Asia and Africa. Source: Al Jazeera --Agencies",

The late Sobhitha Thero was an iconic Buddhist monk in the island nations good governance movement. Responding to the drastic changes in the economic landscape of Sri Lanka, the Government of India decided to infuse additional funds into nine ongoing grant projects to expeditiously complete these projects, while also minimising the impact of the sharp rise in the cost of construction materials on the original scope of projects.

        "date": "March 23, 2024 03:28 pm",
        "content": "Russia has arrested 11 people including four suspected gunmen in connection with a shooting rampage that killed 93 people in a concert hall near Moscow, the Kremlin said on Saturday. It said FSB security service chief Alexander Bortnikov had reported to President Vladimir Putin that those detained included four terrorists and that the service was working to identify their accomplices. Russias Investigative Committee said the death toll had leapt to 93 from the attack in which camouflage-clad gunmen opened fire with automatic weapons at concertgoers near the capital on Friday. It said some died from gunshot wounds and others in a huge fire that broke out in the complex. Interfax quoted the FSB security service as saying the four suspected gunmen had been arrested while heading to the Ukrainian border, and that they had contacts in Ukraine. It said they were being transferred to Moscow. Russia has not made public any evidence of a Ukrainian connection. Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak said on Friday that Kyiv had nothing to do with Fridays attack, for which the Islamic State group claimed responsibility. Russian lawmaker Alexander Khinshtein said the attackers had fled in a Renault vehicle that was spotted by police in Bryansk region, about 340 km (210 miles) southwest of Moscow on Friday night and disobeyed instructions to stop. He said two were arrested after a car chase and two others fled into a forest. From the Kremlin account, it appeared they too were later detained. Khinshtein said a pistol, a magazine for an assault rifle, and passports from Tajikistan were found in the car. Tajikistan is a mainly Muslim Central Asian state that used to be part of the Soviet Union. GUNFIRE AND SCREAMS The shooting took place on Friday evening at Crocus City Hall, a concert venue just west of Moscow where a Soviet-era rock band was due to perform. Verified video showed people taking their seats in the hall, then rushing for the exits as repeated gunfire echoed above screams. Other video showed men shooting at groups of people. Some victims lay motionless in pools of blood. Suddenly there were bangs behind us - shots. A burst of firing - I do not know what, one witness, who asked not to be identified by name, told Reuters. Long lines formed in Moscow on Saturday for people to donate blood. Health officials said more than 120 people were wounded. The death toll is expected to rise, the Investigative Committee, which handles major crimes in Russia, said on Telegram. The Moscow city and regional governments said they would provide financial support for families of the victims and those injured, as well as paying for funerals. Islamic State, the militant group that once sought control over swathes of Iraq and Syria, claimed responsibility for the attack, the groups Amaq agency said on Telegram. Islamic State said its fighters attacked on the outskirts of Moscow, killing and wounding hundreds and causing great destruction to the place before they withdrew to their bases safely. The statement gave no further detail. The United States has intelligence confirming Islamic States claim of responsibility for the shooting, a U.S. official said on Friday. The official said Washington had warned Moscow in recent weeks of the possibility of an attack. We did warn the Russians appropriately, said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity, without providing any additional details. The attack on Crocus City Hall, about 20 km (12 miles) from the Kremlin, happened two weeks after the U.S. embassy in Russia warned that extremists had imminent plans for an attack in Moscow. Hours before the embassy warning, the FSB said it had foiled an attack on a Moscow synagogue by Islamic States affiliate in Afghanistan, known as ISIS-Khorasan or ISIS-K, which seeks a caliphate across Afghanistan, Pakistan, Turkmenistan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and Iran. Putin changed the course of the Syrian civil war by intervening in 2015, supporting President Bashar al-Assad against the opposition and Islamic State. ISIS-K has been fixated on Russia for the past two years, frequently criticizing Putin in its propaganda, said Colin Clarke of the Soufan Center. The broader Islamic State group has claimed deadly attacks across the Middle East, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iran, Europe, the Philippines, and Sri Lanka. Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said it was a bloody terrorist attack that the world should condemn. The United States, European and Arab powers and many former Soviet republics expressed shock and sent their condolences. The United Nations Security Council condemned what it called a heinous and cowardly terrorist attack. SECURITY TIGHTENED Russia tightened security at airports, transport hubs and across the capital - a vast urban area of over 21 million people. All large-scale public events were cancelled across the country. Putin, who was on Sunday re-elected for a new six-year term, sent thousands of troops into Ukraine in 2022 and has repeatedly warned that various powers - including countries in the West - are seeking to sow chaos inside Russia.
