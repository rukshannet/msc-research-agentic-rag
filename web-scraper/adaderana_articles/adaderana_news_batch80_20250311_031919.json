        "title": "UNICEF, WHO to support Sri Lankas supplementary measles immunization activity",
        "date": "January 4, 2024 09:25 pm",
        "content": "UNICEF, together with the World Health Organization (WHO), has planned to support the Health Ministry in implementing a supplementary measles immunization activity (SIA) in Sri Lanka aimed at controlling the ongoing measles outbreak, midst over 700 measles cases reported in the country since May 2023. The SIA will be launched in two phases; the first phase will commence on 6 January, targeting 69-month-olds in 9 identified districts with a high population density, where measles cases were reported including Colombo, Gampaha, Kalutara, Galle, Matara, Kandy, Jaffna, Kurunegala and Kalmunai. The second phase will be initiated on January 20 and extended to other age groups across the country. Speaking at a press briefing held in Colombo recently to announce the launch of the supplementary immunization activity, UN Childrens Fund Representative in Sri Lanka, Christian Skoog said, UNICEF, as well as WHO, has been closely associated partners with the Ministry of Health for many years in the implementation of the national immunization programme, which is a success story in Sri Lanka. However, even with a high immunization coverage, measles outbreaks can occur among unvaccinated children, especially when there are outbreaks in the region. While the numbers are small with the recent measles outbreak, it is important to take it seriously and that is what the Ministry of Health is doing, in taking appropriate steps to control it. He also added the assistance extended by UNICEF during COVID-19 pandemic in 2020-2021 to maintain the quality of vaccines by addressing the gaps in the cold chain equipment system, will undoubtedly support in implementing this effective supplementary immunization activity. Meanwhile, Health Secretary Dr. Palitha Mahipala expressed confidence in the success of the vaccination drive, stating, There is no other country in the world which has reached over 99 immunization coverage. I can confidently state without any hesitation that Sri Lanka is the only country which reached a 99.9 immunization coverage. So, I am optimistic that with this supplementary immunization activity, the measles cases reported will be reduced. The measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine was introduced into Sri Lankas immunization program in 1984. In 2001, a second dose of the vaccine was introduced to improve population level immunity and in 2019, the WHO declared Sri Lanka as a country free of Measles. However, a significant drop in global immunization coverage from 2020 to 2022 impacted many countries in the region, which has led to a rise in measles cases once again, including in Sri Lanka. Dr. Alaka Singh, WHO Representative to Sri Lanka who also spoke at the presser said, The cases reported so far have been mild, and no deaths have been reported. However, measles can be a major childhood disease, which can and must be prevented. Accordingly, Health Ministry has embarked on a rapid supplementary immunization activity in two phases through the strong primary healthcare system. We, as WHO, reiterate our full support for this program and overall recovery in Sri Lanka going forward. Other experts in attendance at the media briefing included Dr. Asela Gunawardena, Director General of Health Services, Ministry of Health; Dr. Vinod Kumar Bura, Coordinator, Immunization and Vaccine Development, Department of Communicable diseases, WHO South-East Asia Regional Office; the Chief Epidemiologist; Director, Health Promotion Bureau as well as other consultants and specialists from MoH. UNICEF and Health Ministry, through this latest SIA are committed to combating any possible measles outbreaks in Sri Lanka. While measles is highly infectious, past vaccination initiatives have shown success in controlling outbreaks when high coverage is achieved. Stakeholders noted that strategic public awareness and community engagement will be critical in conveying the urgency of vaccinations and ensuring the campaigns success.",

        "date": "January 4, 2024 10:34 pm",
        "content": "During the Jaffna and Kilinochchi District Coordinating Committee meeting today (Jan.04), President Ranil Wickremesinghe addressed crucial issues concerning missing persons, land releases, and environmental conservation in the Jaffna district. He emphasized the need for immediate attention and proactive measures to address these pressing matters. The Head of State noted that the issue of resettling displaced persons cannot continue and that there should not be any displaced persons by 2025. He instructed the officials to devise a plan to resettle all those displaced. President Wickremesinghe acknowledged the economic hardships faced by the public and assured that public servants would receive economic relief after the Thai Pongal celebration this year. He emphasized that with the stabilization of the countrys economy, economic relief measures are being extended to the entire population. Furthermore, he affirmed that all outstanding bills resulting from last years economic reforms have been settled.

Additionally, the President disclosed plans to elevate the economic growth rate to 3 by the end of this year, with a targeted increase to 5 in 2025. President Wickremesinghe inquired about the status of missing persons, emphasizing the urgency of the situation. The registered number for the missing persons is 1,788, encompassing all 15 divisional secretariats in the Jaffna district. A total of 1,289 families have been interviewed, but as of now, no reports have been received from the district secretariat. The President directed officials to expedite the process, aiming to conclude the remaining 500 cases swiftly. Additionally, the President proposed contacting the missing persons office for a resolution, setting a target to complete the task within the next six months. Political authorities from Jaffna and Kilinochchi districts, along with government officials, actively participated in this meeting.

He directed officials to expedite land release in the Northern Province and indicated that a definitive decision on the required land for the Palali Airport and security forces would be reached by February. The President also instructed the officials at the Ministry of Lands to visit Jaffna and urged them to take immediate steps to address the land problem in the north. Highlighting the allocation of funds in this years budget for two water schemes, aiming to resolve the water problem in the north, he further noted that measures have been initiated to disburse funds for previously executed water projects. The President also affirmed a commitment to resolving these issues promptly for the well-being and progress of the North. --PMD",

        "title": "IS claims responsibility for deadly Iran bombings that killed 84",
        "date": "January 5, 2024 09:38 am",
        "content": "The Islamic State group (IS) has said it carried out a bomb attack in Iran on crowds marking the anniversary of spymaster Qasem Soleimanis assassination by the US. The attack in Kerman in southern Iran killed 84 people and wounded many more. The death toll was revised down on Thursday morning by the head of Irans emergency services from an earlier figure of 95. Iran initially said that Israel and the US must have been behind the attacks. IS made the claim via its channels on Telegram. The group later released an image on its news outlet Amaq showing two masked men, who it said were responsible for the attacks. The report stated that the first suicide bomber detonated his explosives belt among a gathering of people and that the second bomber triggered his explosives about 20 minutes later. IS named the attackers as Omar al-Muwahhid and Sayfullah al-Mujahid. They are generic names that make it hard to ascertain if the attackers were Iranians or foreigners. IS has attacked civilians and security forces in Iran on a number of occasions in recent years. It welcomed the 2020 death of Gen Soleimani, whose militias fought against the group in Iraq for years. Earlier, President Ebrahim Raisis political deputy, Mohammad Jamshidi, blamed Israel and the US. However, the US said it had no indication that Israel was involved and dismissed any suggestion that Washington was involved. And as many Middle East watchers said at the time, this was not the way Israel operates inside Iran. Attacks there that have been presumed to be orchestrated by Israels external spy agency, Mossad, have nearly always been precisely targeted assassinations of prominent nuclear scientists or military figures. It would not be in Israels interests to squander its precious intelligence assets inside Iran by blowing up civilian mourners. Irans Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei vowed a harsh response to the attacks. Cruel criminals must know that they will be strongly dealt with from now on and undoubtedly there will be a harsh response, Ayatollah Khamenei said in a statement on Wednesday evening. Now that Islamic State (IS) has claimed they were behind it, even naming two suicide bombers they say were involved, an apology from Irans Revolutionary Guard is highly unlikely. The Tehran regimes hostility to the US and Israel is visceral and manifests itself on many fronts: in Lebanon, Iraq, Gaza and Yemen. Soleimani was seen as the most powerful figure in Iran after the supreme leader before he was killed in a US drone strike in neighbouring Iraq in 2020. Wednesdays attack comes amid heightened tensions in the region after the deputy leader of the Iran-backed Palestinian group, Hamas, was killed in an apparent Israeli drone strike in Lebanon. Footage broadcast by Iranian state TV showed large crowds were taking part in a procession along a road lined with banners featuring Qasem Soleimani when the explosions happened. People could be heard screaming and then seen running away in panic after one of the blasts. Iranian media reported the first bomb was detonated around 15:00 local time (11:30 GMT), about 700m (2,300ft) from the Garden of Martyrs cemetery around the Saheb al-Zaman mosque, in the eastern outskirts of Kerman. The second bombing took place about 15 minutes later, around 1km away from the cemetery, targeting people who had fled the first, they said. Kerman provinces governor told state news agency Irna that both blasts happened outside security checkpoints and that authorities were sure they were caused by bombs. But he said it was not yet clear whether they were detonated remotely or by suicide attackers. The hardline Tasnim news agency, which is affiliated with Irans Revolutionary Guards, earlier cited sources as saying that two bags carrying bombs were apparently detonated by remote control. We were walking towards the cemetery when a car suddenly stopped behind us and a waste bin containing a bomb exploded, a witness was quoted by Isna news agency as saying. We only heard the sound of the explosion and saw people falling. As commander of the Revolutionary Guards overseas operations arm, the Quds Force, Soleimani was an architect of Iranian policy across the region. He was in charge of the Quds Forces clandestine missions and its provision of guidance, funding, weapons, intelligence and logistical support to allied governments and armed groups, including Hezbollah and Hamas. Then-US President Donald Trump, who ordered the 2020 drone strike, described Soleimani as the number one terrorist anywhere in the world and alleged that troops under his command had murdered hundreds of American civilians and servicemen over the previous two decades. Irans government accused the US of an act of international terrorism and issued arrest warrants for Mr Trump and other officials. Source: BBC -Agencies",

        "date": "January 5, 2024 11:32 am",
        "content": "Police said that a 17-year-old suspect killed a sixth grader and wounded five others in a shooting early Thursday at a high school in the small town of Perry, Iowa. The suspect was identified as Dylan Butler, a 17-year-old student at Perry high school, officials said at a news briefing on Thursday afternoon. He was found dead with an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound by responding officers. Police also discovered an improvised explosive device when searching the high school, Mitch Mortvedt, an assistant director with the state department of criminal investigation, told reporters. Members of the state fire marshals office and the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives rendered the device safe. Four of the wounded victims are students, and the fifth is a school administrator, said Mortvedt, who declined to release any names. Another school district, Easton Valley Community, issued a statement saying it had received word that Dan Marburger, the high school principal, had been shot in the attack. One victim was in critical condition but did not appear to be facing life-threatening injuries, Mortvedt said, while the other four were in stable condition. The shooting came on the first day back in class at the school following the winter holiday break. Perry, a town of about 7,900, is about 40 miles (64km) north-west of Des Moines, the states capital city. The attack took place just after 7.30am, before most students and faculty had entered the building. The suspect was armed with a pump-action shotgun and a handgun, Mortvedt said, and had made a number of social media posts around the time of the shooting. The motive for the attack is under investigation. Earlier on Thursday, Adam Infante, the sheriff of Dallas county, where Perry is located, told reporters there was no additional threat to students, staff or the public. There is no further danger to the public. The community is safe. Were just now working backwards trying to figure out everything that happened, he told a morning press conference at Perry high school. School didnt start yet. Luckily, there were very few students and faculty in the building, which I think contributed to a good outcome in that sense. In a statement posted to X, Kim Reynolds, the Republican governor of Iowa, said she was on her way to the scene. Our hearts are broken by this senseless tragedy. Our prayers are with the students, teachers  families of the Perry community, she wrote. I have been in contact with law enforcement agencies and am continuing to monitor the situation. I will be joining their press conference today. Joe Biden has been briefed on the shooting and spoken with Reynolds, the White House said. Iowas two Republican senators, Chuck Grassley and Joni Ernst, also sent messages of support. Rachael Kares, an 18-year-old senior, said she had been finishing band practice when she heard what she described as four gunshots, spaced apart. We all just jumped, Kares said. My band teacher looked at us and yelled, Run! So we ran. Kares and others ran out of the school past a football field, and said she heard people yelling: Get out! Get out! The high school is part of the 1,785-student Perry community school district. The shooting occurred against the backdrop of campaigns preceding the Iowa caucuses, where Republican candidates vying for the presidency are in the area as the 2024 election campaign season ramps up. The caucuses are scheduled for 15 January. Floridas governor, Ron DeSantis, who is among the challengers, told NBCs Meet the Press Now on Thursday that he believed dealing with mass shootings was more of a local and state issue. Asked if he would make changes at the federal level to gun laws if elected president, DeSantis said: I dont support infringing the rights of law-abiding citizens with respect to the ability to exercise their constitutional rights. The Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy had been scheduled to hold a rally in Perry but changed the event to an in-person prayer meeting after reports of the shooting, a campaign spokesperson said.

        "date": "January 5, 2024 12:02 pm",
        "content": "During a discussion with professionals in Jaffna on Thursday (Jan.04), President Ranil Wickremesinghe outlined the trajectory of Sri Lankas economic recovery after facing multiple setbacks in recent years. Addressing the audience, the Head of State acknowledged the challenges faced by the nation, citing the 2019 Easter Sunday terror attacks and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. He highlighted the grim economic situation in 2022, where the country witnessed a growth decline of over 7. However, the President emphasized his role in stabilizing the economy in 2023, with positive growth observed in the later quarters. President Wickremesinghe shared his optimism for the coming years, projecting a positive growth of 2-3 for the current year and a more substantial growth of about 5 in 2025. He underscored the importance of these two years as stabilizing periods and unveiled a strategic shift in economic policies. The President urged provinces to utilize the powers granted by the 13th Amendment for economic development, asserting that devolution should not merely be a political concept but an economic reality. If we examine the provisions of the 13th Amendment, there is ample authority to establish a robust local economy. We pledge not to intervene in those affairs. I am encouraging you to take the initiative. Rather than seeking to monopolize funds from Colombo, consider the examples set by other nations. Take Japan, for instance; its not a federal state, yet various departments and regions are well-developed. The same can be observed in Korea. Look at the United KingdomScotland and Wales have their own developed economies. Why cant we emulate such functioning regional economies? France offers a comparable model with economic centres around Paris, Marseille, and other cities. Through devolution, we can harness these powers and foster development. While devolution is often discussed in political terms, its essential to enact laws that empower regions. Mere vocal advocacy without financial resources holds little value. Presently, the Western Province is the sole region capable of substantial independent spending, while others are financially dependent on it. This situation warrants reconsideration. By utilizing the powers within the 13th Amendment, each province can chart its course to development. Its time to put these powers into action. A key aspect of the Presidents economic plan involves abandoning the practice of printing more money and avoiding excessive borrowing from banks. He highlighted the need to focus on revenue generation, setting a target of 12 of the GDP initially, with a long-term goal of reaching 15. To achieve this, the President announced plans to increase the Value-Added Tax (VAT) in certain instances to ensure a steady flow of revenue for national budgets, development projects, and interest payments. President Wickremesinghe introduced a paradigm shift in economic development, emphasizing decentralization. He proposed the establishment of local and regional economies in various provinces, moving away from the dominance of the western province and Colombo. The President envisioned distinct economies for the South, Central, North, and North-Western provinces, each capitalizing on its unique potential for agriculture, tourism, and other sectors. Meanwhile, President Wickremesinghe highlighted three key areas for economic growth  renewable energy, modernizing agriculture, and tourism. He emphasized the vast potential for renewable energy in the Northern Province, particularly in wind and solar power. The President also outlined plans for modernizing agriculture, making it competitive on a global scale. Additionally, he introduced initiatives to boost tourism, including cruise tourism and themed trails focused on religious and cultural sites. Education emerged as a pivotal element in the Presidents vision for economic growth. He envisioned the Northern Province as a hub for education, encouraging the establishment of universities and educational institutions. The President announced plans for substantial investments in technological research, AI, and digital transformation to position Sri Lanka as a digital economy by 2025. President Wickremesinghe concluded by urging collaboration among civil society, businesses, and members of parliament in the Northern Province to collectively drive economic development. He emphasized the governments commitment to creating an environment conducive to innovation, investment, and economic prosperity, with the ultimate goal of improving job opportunities and fostering national growth.",

        "date": "January 5, 2024 12:32 pm",
        "content": "The State Minister of Indigenous Medicine, Sisira Jayakody announced on Thursday (Jan.04) that athe government has taken a significant step towards reducing healthcare costs by exempting Ayurvedic products, medicines and industries-related to indigenous medicine from Value Added Tax (VAT). The decision aims to make traditional medicine more accessible to the public, he explained. Additionally, the State Minister mentioned that the cabinet has granted approval for the establishment of a special bureau dedicated to addressing issues affecting native doctors and ensuring the sustainability of the indigenous medicine system. Speaking at a media briefing held at the Presidential Media Centre (PMC), Jayakody highlighted the Ayurveda Corporations plan to introduce Ayurvedic healing centers, known as Body Mantras, as part of a transformative change in the field of indigenous medicine. State Minister Sisira Jayakody further commented: Significant strides have been made in the realm of indigenous medicine, with the government opting to exempt Ayurvedic products, medicines and related industries from VAT. This decision aims to reduce healthcare costs. The Cabinet has approved the establishment of a specialized bureau dedicated to preserving traditional medicine. Operating under the Ministry of Indigenous Medicine, this bureau is tasked with addressing issues affecting traditional medicine until a formal institution is established. Its objectives include granting proper recognition to registered and unregistered native doctors, conducting studies on the medical system, developing an appropriate framework and collecting information about the profession. Following discussions, it has been recommended to the Cabinet to approve the establishment of a unit to safeguard traditional medicine, as outlined in Paragraph 03.1 of the Cabinet Memorandum, without being a burden to the Treasury. The Ayurveda Corporation is introducing Ayurvedic health care centers, known as Body Mantra, to the local medical field, with the aim of bringing transformative change to indigenous medicine. The establishment of physical healthcare services, supervised by graduate-trained massage therapists, will be implemented through Ayurvedic healthcare centers. This initiative extends both domestically and internationally and organizations in the hotel and tourism industry in the country are invited to register, with a newspaper advertisement set for release on the 10th of this month. By the end of this year, efforts are underway to elevate the production and cultivation of indigenous medicines to a commercial industry level. Traditionally at a subsistence level, the focus now shifts to commercial cultivation, with plans to cultivate Long pepper (Thippili) plants alongside paddy cultivation. Long pepper plants can be harvested for four seasons, offering a significant economic advantage over traditional methods. The goal is not only to enhance domestic production but also to generate raw materials locally. The Suwa Daruwo program aims to provide a robust and advanced education for government employees involved in the indigenous medical field. Additionally, efforts are directed towards empowering Ayurveda councils. In the coming months, arrangements are being made to organize a program awarding the Presidential Gold Awards to indigenous pharmaceutical manufacturers and individuals contributing to the field.",

        "content": "State Minister for Power and Energy Indika Anuruddha announced that the necessary data for reducing electricity bills has been submitted to the Public Utilities Commission. As a result, a revision of the electricity bill is anticipated by the first week of February. Detailing the new generation plan, the state minister highlighted a target to procure nearly 600 megawatts of electricity from renewable sources in 2024. The State Minister conveyed these updates during a media briefing at the Presidential Media Center (PMC) held today (05) under the theme Collective Path to a Stable Country. State Minister Indika Anuruddha further commented: In the year 2023, significant strides were made in the power sector, addressing shortcomings in the existing Electricity Act and prioritizing high quality consumer service through the introduction of a new Act. The new legislation incorporates provisions related to consumer protection and regulation. Furthermore, efforts were dedicated to increasing the share of renewable energy in power generation. The generation plan aims to achieve 70 of electricity from renewable sources, with a target of obtaining nearly 600 megawatts of renewable energy in 2024. The Ministry has been entrusted with the construction of solar panels, focusing on expediting projects below 10 megawatts. Notable projects in Mannar, Pooneryn and Hambantota have been incorporated into the generation plan. A commitment to reducing electricity bills is underscored through the production of renewable energy using hydro, solar and wind power. Data supporting the reduction of electricity bills has been submitted to the Public Utilities Commission and a reduction is anticipated either by the end of this month or in the first week of February.

        "content": "The Criminal Investigation Department (CID) says it commenced an investigation into the preacher named Ruwan Prasanna Gunaratna, who promoted mass suicide through his distorted teachings and later died by suicide. When the CID officers presented submissions in this regard, the Colombo Fort Magistrates Court also called for an investigation to determine if the deceased preacher had received funds from any organizations and how the money was spent. Earlier this week, CID launched an investigation into the seven deaths that had recently occurred under similar suspicious circumstances, after the bodies of a young woman and a man were found by the police. It was suspected that the duo had died after consuming a strange concoction. The duo were said to have been the followers of a certain religious preacher who had committed suicide in the Homagama area days prior. The body of the 21-year-old woman was recovered at her residence in the Yakkala area while the body of the 34-year-old man, who was residing in Ambalangoda, was found at a guest house in the Maharagama area where he was temporarily staying. An individual identified as Ruwan Prasanna Gunaratne, who had engaged in religion-related preaching activities in various parts of the island, was found dead from poisoning and was believed to have committed suicide in December. A few days later on December 31, his wife, 35, was reported to have committed suicide by consuming a concoction after feeding poison to her two sons and daughter at their home in Kahantota in Malabe, according to police. The womans two sons and daughter were reportedly aged 09, 08 and 07 years respectively. Meanwhile, the 21-year-old woman and 34-year-old man in question were found to have attended the funeral of the religious preacher. Investigators suspect that all seven deaths were the result of ingestion of the same type of poison.",

        "date": "January 5, 2024 10:18 pm",
        "content": "U.S. employers hired more workers than expected in December while raising wages at a solid clip, prompting financial markets to dial back expectations that the Federal Reserve would start cutting interest rates in March. There were, however, potential red flags in the closely watched employment report from the Labor Department on Friday. While the unemployment rate held at 3.7 last month, that was because 676,000 people left the labor force. Some economists attributed this to difficulties adjusting the data for seasonal fluctuations. The economy also added 71,000 fewer jobs in October and November than previously reported. Nonetheless, the report indicated that the economy avoided a recession last year and would likely continue to grow through 2024 as labor market resilience supports consumer spending. This report lowers the probability of the Fed cutting in March and confirms our view that the Fed will not begin cutting as soon as the markets expect, said Jeffrey Roach, chief economist at LPL Financial in Charlotte, North Carolina. Nonfarm payrolls increased by 216,000 jobs last month, the Labor Departments Bureau of Labor Statistics said. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast payrolls rising by 170,000 jobs. The economy added 2.7 million jobs in 2023, a sharp step-down from the 4.8 million positions created in 2022. That reflected cooling demand in the economy following 525 basis points worth of rate hikes from the U.S. central bank since March 2022. Roughly 100,000 jobs per month are needed to keep up with growth in the working age population. Government hiring as state and local governments try to bring education staffing back to pre-pandemic levels led the rise in employment last month, with 52,000 jobs added. Government payrolls growth averaged 56,000 jobs per month in 2023, more than double the average monthly of 23,000 in 2022. Employment in the healthcare sector increased 38,000, spread across ambulatory health care services and hospitals. Unseasonably mild weather boosted hiring at construction sites, with payrolls in the industry rising 17,000. Leisure and hospitality employment gained 40,000. Employment in the industry is below its pre-pandemic February 2020 level by 163,000. Retail employment rose 17,000. But employment in transportation and warehousing industry fell 23,000. Average hourly earnings rose 0.4, matching the prior months gain. That raised the year-on-year increase in wages to 4.1 from 4.0 in November. The dollar rose against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices fell. Financial markets trimmed bets for a March rate cut to roughly 53 from about 65 earlier. SOFT HOUSEHOLD DETAILS The Fed held its policy rate steady in the current 5.25-5.50 range last month and policymakers signaled in new economic projections that the historic monetary policy tightening engineered over the last two years is at an end and lower borrowing costs are coming in 2024. The share of industries reporting job growth increased last month, which could help to assuage concerns that hiring was too concentrated in a few sectors. With Decembers employment report, the government incorporated annual revisions to the seasonally adjusted household survey data, from which the unemployment rate is derived, for the past five years. The revisions had little impact on the jobless rate or the labor force participation rate. The unemployment rate has risen from a five-decade low of 3.4 in April amid an influx of people into the labor force, some of it tied to a rise in immigration. Household employment plunged 683,000 in December, while about 676,000 people left the workforce last month. Household employment tends to be very volatile. The labor force participation rate, or the proportion of working-age Americans who have a job or are looking for one, fell to 62.5 from 62.8. These changes are big enough to be noteworthy, but less concerning because they are in the same direction, suggesting there could be a seasonal adjustment issue accounting for the big declines, said Chris Low, chief economist at FHN Financial in New York. Well be watching household employment closely for the next few months. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "date": "January 5, 2024 10:50 pm",
        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe emphasized the imperative for the full development of the Northern Province within the next five years under a unified plan. Highlighting the Western Provinces pivotal role, contributing over 50 to the countrys economy and currently serving as the primary engine, the President asserted the commitment to strengthen the nations economy through five main engines, encompassing the South, North, Central Province and the North-West. President Ranil Wickremesinghe conveyed these directives during his participation in the special District Coordination Committee meeting for Vavuniya, Mullaitivu and Mannar districts, which convened today (05) at the Vavuniya District Cultural Hall. Extensive discussions were conducted on the challenges in the domains of education, health, resettlement, land, electricity, water, tourism, forestry and fisheries in the districts of Vavuniya, Mannar and Mullaitivu. The President actively engaged in addressing some of these issues by working towards effective solutions. Furthermore, the President highlighted the strategic vision to transform Colombo, Kandy and the Northern Province as the three main centres of education in the country, emphasizing a focused effort to enhance educational development in Sri Lanka. President Ranil Wickremesinghe, providing additional remarks, expressed: Our countrys economy has traditionally relied on a single engine, namely the Western Province, which contributes over 50 to the national economy. However, the economic contributions from other provinces have been relatively modest. To propel our nation forward swiftly, it is imperative to diversify and strengthen the engines that drive economic growth. We have identified five provincesSouth, North, West, Central and North-West as focal points for cultivating robust economies that will contribute significantly to Sri Lankas national economic landscape. Currently, the country possesses financial stability, enabling the resumption of stalled projects. Additionally, projects reliant on foreign aid have regained momentum, capitalizing on the available financial strength. Furthermore, the Northern Province possesses significant potential to substantially enhance the national economy of the country. The unique wind and thermal conditions in the Northern Province create ample opportunities for renewable energy production. By harnessing the energy potential of the Northern Province, surplus energy can be exported to India, generating additional revenue. Conversations on this matter have already been initiated. The farmers in the Northern Province exhibit remarkable talent and efficiency. Through the implementation of the Agricultural Modernization Program, there is the potential to establish export agriculture, thereby maximizing the productivity of farmland in the Northern Province. Minister of Transport, Highways, and Mass Media Dr. Bandula Gunawardena expressed appreciation for President Ranil Wickremesinghes commendable role in steering the country towards economic stability during a challenging period of severe recession. Upon assuming office, President Wickremesinghe faced critical shortages, including gas, fuel and electricity cuts lasting up to ten hours. The foreign reserves had depleted to zero. Despite these challenges, the President implemented measures to fortify the economy, ultimately facilitating the resumption of development projects in the Northern Province. In a recent development, the President directed the acceleration of road projects in the Northern Province, while initiatives are underway to enhance transportation and promote tourism in the region. Recognizing the challenges faced by farmers in transporting their crops, arrangements have been made to provide a train for goods transportation, enabling storage and market accessibility. Furthermore, the President has instructed the provision of buses from India to every depot in the Northern Province, aiming to expedite the overall development of the region. Governor of the Northern Province, Mrs. P. S. M. Charles reported that the Jaffna district achieved a milestone by producing the top results in the recent G.C.E. Advanced -Level Examination across the island. Additionally, the Northern Province demonstrated commendable performance in the G.C.E. Ordinary Level Examinations. Plans are underway to establish an education zone by amalgamating the Madhu and Thunukkai areas. Dedicated and efficient efforts from teachers are contributing to the development of education in the Northern Province, a positive trend that is cause for satisfaction. The administration is actively addressing issues within the health sector. Acknowledging a lack of a formal system for transporting farmers crops in the province, the Governor expressed the intention to engage in discussions with the Minister of Transport to explore and implement viable solutions. State Minister Mr. Kader Mastan, expressed gratitude to President Ranil Wickremesinghe for his continued attention and efforts to address the needs of their area during his recent visit. In the Mullaitivu district, steps have been taken to release the necessary land for agriculture, and there is a request to extend this initiative to areas surrounding ponds for agricultural purposes. Additionally, the Minister urged the President to provide solutions to challenges related to the maintenance of elephant fences and fishing issues. Member of Parliament Kulasingham Thilipan acknowledged and appreciated the significant announcement regarding the release of land in the Vavuniya district by the Department of Forestry, marking the first instance of such an initiative. Gratitude was extended to President Ranil Wickremesinghe and the relevant authorities for this positive development. Furthermore, the Member of Parliament highlighted the Presidents proposal to boost milk production in the Vavuniya district and requested the release of the necessary pastures to support and implement this proposal. Member of Parliament, Mr. Charles Nirmalanathan expressed gratitude to the President for his visit, acknowledging the release of two out of three political prisoners, as announced during the budget session. However, he highlighted that approximately 12 political prisoners, arrested during the last war, are still awaiting special permission for release or bail. Member of Parliament, Mr. Selvam Adaikkalanathan noted that despite the end of the war, significant development work in Vavuniya has not taken place. He commended President Ranil Wickremesinghe for focusing on this issue and expressed hope for appropriate solutions with the on-going confidence-building efforts in land release. Additionally, he urged prompt development work for hospitals in the district. The gathering included Minister of Transport, Highways, and Mass Media Bandula Gunawardena, State Minister Cader Mastan, Member of Parliament Wajira Abeywardena, Chairman of the Vavuniya District DCC  Member of Parliament MrKulasingham Pradeepan, Mr. Selvam Adekkalanathan, Mr. Charles Nirmalanathan, Mr S.

        "date": "January 6, 2024 08:59 am",
        "content": "The government of Myanmar has agreed to help release the 56 Sri Lankans who are forcibly detained by a terror group for cyber slavery. The Ambassador of Sri Lanka to Myanmar, Janaka Priyantha Bandara said the agreement was reached during a special discussion held with the Burmese officials. In December, reports were rife about a group of Sri Lankans who were lured with tourist visas behind the false front of lucrative job offers in the IT sector and were trafficked to Myanmar through its border with Thailand. These workers had travelled to Myanmar without registering with the Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment (SLBFE). The Sri Lankans forcibly detained at the terrorist camp in Myawaddy  an area infested with cybercrimes under the grip of an armed group  were reported to be working as cyber slaves forced to commit internet scams. The Sri Lankans, who fell victim to this scam, have said that they were initially unaware of the cybercrime camp. Despite initially being told that they would be doing jobs such as data entry, these Sri Lankans have been forced to appear as romantic partners to foreigners, especially Europeans and Americans, in order to steal their money. When they refuse to do as told, the captives are reportedly subjected to torture, which they said includes electrocution, waterboarding in cages, hanging them by their hands and starving. Reportedly, Sri Lankan youths have been experiencing this plight since 2022. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs said it had previously rescued 32 such Sri Lankans between 2022 and 2023. Given the grave nature of the situation, Foreign Minister Ali Sabry had raised concerns about the safety of Sri Lankan nationals with his Myanmar counterpart Than Swe on the sidelines of BIMSTEC Foreign Ministers Retreat in Bangkok, Thailand. Minister Sabry, in a telephone conversation with his Myanmar Foreign Minister Than Swe on January 03, once again sought assistance and urgent intervention of the Myanmar government to have the captive Sri Lankans released. Against this backdrop, the Human Trafficking, Human Smuggling, and Maritime Crimes Division of the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) initiated two special investigations into the matter. Four suspects including three Sri Lankans and a Chinese national were identified based on the complaints received by the police.",

According to the Epidemiology Unit, children born between April 07, 2023, and July 05, 2023, are eligible to receive the additional vaccination dose. The second phase will be initiated on January 20 and extended to other age groups across the country. The health authorities decided to administer an additional vaccination dose against measles to infants aged between 6 - 9 months as cases began to surge over the past year. The MMR vaccination should be considered an additional vaccination dose, the Epidemiology Unit explained, noting that routine MMR vaccination should be given to all children who have received SIA-MMR vaccination, on completion of 9 months and 3 years of age. Concerns were raised after Sri Lanka recorded over 700 cases of measles over the course of 2023, despite being declared by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2019 as the fourth country in the Southeast Asian region to eliminate the acute viral respiratory illness. Health officials have urged parents to ensure their children receive the necessary immunization. Meanwhile, the UNICEF, together with the World Health Organization (WHO), decided to support the Health Ministry in implementing the SIA in Sri Lanka aimed at controlling the ongoing measles outbreak. The MMR vaccine was introduced into Sri Lankas immunization program in 1984. In 2001, a second dose of the vaccine was introduced to improve population level immunity and in 2019, the WHO declared Sri Lanka as a country free of Measles. However, a significant drop in global immunization coverage from 2020 to 2022 impacted many countries in the region, which has led to a rise in measles cases once again, including in Sri Lanka.",

        "date": "January 6, 2024 04:10 pm",
        "content": "The US Supreme Court said Friday it will decide whether former President Donald Trump can be kept off the ballot because of his efforts to overturn his 2020 election loss, inserting the court squarely in the 2024 presidential campaign. The justices acknowledged the need to reach a decision quickly, as voters will soon begin casting presidential primary ballots across the country. The court agreed to take up Trumps appeal of a case from Colorado stemming from his role in the events that culminated in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol. Underscoring the urgency, arguments will be held on Feb. 8, during what is normally a nearly monthlong winter break for the justices. The compressed timeframe could allow the court to produce a decision before Super Tuesday on March 5, when the largest number of delegates are up for grabs in a single day, including in Colorado. Trump, speaking at a campaign event in Iowa, said: All I want is fair. I just hope that theyre going to be fair. The court will be considering for the first time the meaning and reach of a provision of the 14th Amendment barring some people who engaged in insurrection from holding public office. The amendment was adopted in 1868, following the Civil War. It has been so rarely used that the nations highest court had no previous occasion to interpret it. Colorados Supreme Court, by a 4-3 vote, ruled last month that Trump should not be on the Republican primary ballot. The decision was the first time the 14th Amendment was used to bar a presidential contender from the ballot. Trump is separately appealing to state court a ruling by Maines Democratic secretary of state, Shenna Bellows, that he was ineligible to appear on that states ballot over his role in the Capitol attack. Both the Colorado Supreme Court and the Maine secretary of states rulings are on hold until the appeals play out. The high courts decision to intervene, which both sides called for, is the most direct involvement in a presidential election since Bush v. Gore in 2000, when a conservative majority effectively decided the election for Republican George W. Bush. Only Justice Clarence Thomas remains from that court. Three of the nine Supreme Court justices were appointed by Trump, though they have repeatedly ruled against him in 2020 election-related lawsuits, as well as his efforts to keep documents related to Jan. 6 and his tax returns from being turned over to congressional committees. At the same time, Justices Amy Coney Barrett, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh have been in the majority of conservative-driven decisions that overturned the five-decade-old constitutional right to abortion, expanded gun rights and struck down affirmative action in college admissions. Some Democratic lawmakers have called on Thomas to step aside from the case because of his wifes support for Trumps effort to overturn the results of the election, which he lost to Democrat Joe Biden. Thomas is unlikely to agree, and there was every indication Friday that all the justices are participating. Thomas has recused himself from only one other case related to the 2020 election, involving former law clerk John Eastman, and so far the people trying to disqualify Trump havent asked him to recuse. The 4-3 Colorado decision cites a ruling by Gorsuch when he was a federal judge in that state. That Gorsuch decision upheld Colorados move to strike a naturalized citizen from the states presidential ballot because he was born in Guyana and didnt meet the constitutional requirements to run for office. The court found that Trump likewise doesnt meet the qualifications due to his role in the U.S. Capitol attack on Jan. 6, 2021. That day, the Republican president had held a rally outside the White House and exhorted his supporters to fight like hell before they walked to the Capitol. The two-sentence provision in Section 3 of the 14th Amendment states that anyone who swore an oath to uphold the constitution and then engaged in insurrection against it is no longer eligible for state or federal office. After Congress passed an amnesty for most of the former confederates the measure targeted in 1872, the provision fell into disuse until dozens of suits were filed to keep Trump off the ballot this year. Only the one in Colorado was successful. Trump had asked the court to overturn the Colorado ruling without even hearing arguments. The Colorado Supreme Court decision would unconstitutionally disenfranchise millions of voters in Colorado and likely be used as a template to disenfranchise tens of millions of voters nationwide, Trumps lawyers wrote. They argue that Trump should win on many grounds, including that the events of Jan. 6 did not constitute an insurrection. Even if it did, they wrote, Trump himself had not engaged in insurrection. They also contend that the insurrection clause does not apply to the president and that Congress must act, not individual states. Critics of the former president who sued in Colorado agreed that the justices should step in now and resolve the issue, as do many election law experts. This case is of utmost national importance. And given the upcoming presidential primary schedule, there is no time to wait for the issues to percolate further. The Court should resolve this case on an expedited timetable, so that voters in Colorado and elsewhere will know whether Trump is indeed constitutionally ineligible when they cast their primary ballots, lawyers for the Colorado plaintiffs told the Supreme Court. The issue of whether Trump can be on the ballot is not the only matter related to the former president or Jan. 6 that has reached the high court. The justices last month declined a request from special counsel Jack Smith to swiftly take up and rule on Trumps claims that he is immune from prosecution in a case charging him with plotting to overturn the 2020 presidential election, though the issue could be back before the court soon depending on the ruling of a Washington-based appeals court. And the court has said that it intends to hear an appeal that could upend hundreds of charges stemming from the Capitol riot, including against Trump. Source - AP News - Agencies",

        "date": "January 6, 2024 09:53 pm",
        "content": "The Indian Navy on Friday rescued the crew of a merchant vessel after its attempted hijack in the Arabian Sea and said it had not found any pirates on board. An Indian Navy warship intercepted the Liberian-flagged MV Lila Norfolk bulk carrier less than a day after it had received a report that the vessel had been hijacked about 460 nautical miles off Somalia. About five to six armed people boarded the vessel on Thursday, according to a report received by the UK Maritime Trade Operations (UKMTO) agency, which said the ships crew had gathered in the ships citadel. The navy said all 21 crew on board, including 15 Indians, had been evacuated. The vessel, which was chartered by miner Anglo-American (AAL.L), left the Acu port in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on Dec. 6 carrying iron ore, the company said in a statement. The entire crew is safe and the ship is on its way to its destination, scheduled to arrive on Jan. 12, it said, without detailing the volume of iron ore the ship was carrying. The vessel was destined for Khalifa bin Salman in Bahrain, according to British maritime security firm Ambrey. The attempt of hijacking by the pirates was probably abandoned with the forceful warning by the Indian Navy, the navy said in a statement. The Indian Navy has increased its surveillance of the Arabian Sea after recent attacks in the region. The hijacking and attempted hijacking of commercial ships in the Gulf of Aden and Arabian Sea resumed in December after a six-year lull. Experts believe pirates have been encouraged by U.S.-led anti-piracy naval forces diverting their attention to the neighbouring Red Sea to thwart attacks there by Houthi rebels. Data from the Indian Navys Information Fusion Centre - Indian Ocean Region show at least three hijackings in December. The previous such incident was reported in 2017. The sudden revival in ship hijacking and attacks can only be attributed to the pirates willingness to take advantage of the fact that the focus of anti-piracy maritime forces has largely shifted from the Gulf of Aden to the Red Sea, Abhijit Singh, head of the Maritime Policy Initiative at the Observer Research Foundation think tank in New Delhi, said. India is not part of the U.S.-led Red Sea task force. Source: Reuters -Agencies",

He highlighted that officials from relevant Ministries will visit the Northern Province within the next two weeks to assess the situation, with plans to establish a dynamic agency dedicated to resolving issues faced by the business community in the province. President Wickremesinghe made these remarks during a discussion held earlier today at the Jaffna District Secretariat, engaging with industrialists, fishermen and farmers of the Jaffna District. Approximately 300 representatives from the industrial, fishing and farming sectors in the Northern Province are actively engaged in this event, wherein they presented their challenges and proposed new ideas related to their respective industries to President Ranil Wickremesinghe. President Wickremesinghe, attentively addressing the concerns raised, promptly initiated actions to provide solutions to certain issues. Notably, the industrialists have appealed to the President for the establishment of an industrial zone in the Northern Province. In response, the President has directed officials to explore suitable land areas for this purpose.

During the meeting, a comprehensive development plan outlining transformative changes for Jaffna University was presented to President Ranil Wickremesinghe. President Ranil Wickremesinghe proposed a comprehensive redesign of the university system, particularly emphasizing technological advancements. He urged the implementation of diverse approaches to ensure English proficiency among all university students, advocating for the use of distance learning methods. Acknowledging the challenge of human resources, the President suggested tapping into the diaspora, including retired individuals, and welcoming foreign lecturers who express interest.

The President stressed the importance of understanding the expectations of those willing to contribute, and measures have already been introduced to facilitate their involvement. He encouraged clear communication of specific requirements to ensure a seamless process. To address the human resource shortage, the President proposed exploring the option of attracting non-diaspora lecturers, possibly from Sri Lanka or other countries like India (Bangalore) or the United States. External lecturers would be engaged for a defined period, with Jaffna leading the initiative for other universities to follow. The President also suggested considering agreements with other universities, allowing them to provide lecturers as needed. This collaborative effort would rely on the commitment of each university to implement these measures successfully. In terms of foreign students, universities were encouraged to decide on enrolment targets based on their willingness and capacity. --PMD",

        "content": "The Bar Association of Sri Lanka (BASL) has raised alarm about what it said was a rise in arbitrary arrests and criminal activity. Our legal system provides for investigation, inquiry, trial, and punishment by proper authorities which is the base of democracy and the Rule of Law, and, the credibility and transparency of such process, must be diligently and fiercely preserved. In a statement, the BASLs Executive Committee firmly condemned the regrettable shooting incident that transpired in Weligama, resulting in the tragic demise of a Police Sergeant and the injury of a Sub Inspector from the Colombo Crimes Division (CCD). This incident purportedly occurred within the context of an operation aimed at apprehending a group allegedly engaged in illicit drug activities. The BASL also underscored the utmost significance of adhering to due process and upholding the rule of law. The association deemed police raids, including the demolition of property carried out without valid search warrants andor valid search orders, whilst flagrantly violating established legal protocols, render them unlawful. It noted that such unwarranted actions not only undermine the bedrock principles of justice but also erode public confidence in the integrity of law enforcement agencies. In terms of Article 13 (4) of the Constitution, no person shall be punished with death or imprisonment except by order of a competent court. Hence, even a convicted criminal has a right not to be arbitrarily deprived of his life except in accordance with procedure established by law. The prospect of extrajudicial killings and arbitrary arrests presents a deeply disconcerting opportunity for the abuse of power, the statement read further. The BASLs statement further read: Our collective legacy will harshly judge us if we remain silent in the face of such grave transgressions. It is imperative that the authorities act in full accordance with the law, ensuring that justice is served for both the victims and the accused parties involved. Moreover, we express deep concern over recent statements made by the Minister of Public Security, which implicate certain lawyers as conspirators with drug offenders. The absence of police accountability and the grant of unchecked impunity create an environment where no individual can feel secure. BASL underscores the urgent need for transparency, accountability, and the protection of the rights of all individuals engaged in legal proceedings. In light of these disconcerting developments, BASL calls upon the authorities to promptly rectify these issues, hold the responsible parties accountable, and restore public trust in the justice system. It is only by steadfastly upholding the principles of due process and ensuring the primacy of the rule of law that we can establish a society that is equitable and just for all its members.",

        "content": "(Reuters) - A train collision in Indonesias West Java province on Friday killed four people and injured 42, local police said, as authorities investigated the cause of the crash. Video images from broadcasters MetroTV and Kompas TV showed passengers being helped out of train carriages, some of which had gone off the rails entirely. The four dead were crew members, said Ibrahim Tompo, a spokesperson for West Java province police, adding that a total of 478 passengers were aboard the trains. Two crew members had died after they were squeezed between carriages, Ibrahim said. But one body still could not be evacuated because it was still buried in the debris from the cars, he said. Ambulances gathered to take the injured to hospital, police said, following the collision at 6:03 a.m. (1103 GMT) near the provincial capital of Bandung. The cause of the crash not immediately clear, but train operator PT KAI and the provincial government have said they will investigate, along with transport safety officials. Land transport accidents are common in Indonesia. A train crash in 2010 killed 36 people, the deadliest in recent years. In December last year, a commuter line hit a car near Bandung, killing five people while in November, 11 people died after collision between a train and a minibus in East Java province.

Issuing a statement in this regard, the SEC noted: The scope of infrastructure development in emerging economies has evolved significantly in recent decades and now comprises a broad range that includes traditional infrastructure projects such as power, oil and gas, and water as well as low-carbon, climate-resilient infrastructure such as renewable energy projects. SEC carried out a study of comparable jurisdictions which had successfully used Infrastructure Bonds listed in the capital market to finance major development projects of their respective governments. Aimed at fostering development, transparency, and investor confidence in the capital market, the SEC has set a Capital Market Reforms Agenda which includes 12 Key Areas for action. The introduction of infrastructure financing products are part of the Reforms Agenda and is strategically designed to propel the capital market to new heights and contribute significantly to its growth and sustainability. The CSE is expected to market this product actively among potential issuers. The regulatory framework for Infrastructure Bonds has provisions to ensure investor protection, stringent due diligence, disclosure, and reporting requirements for issuers in order to keep investors informed on the performance of the infrastructure projects, utilization of proceeds and risk factors pertaining to the infrastructure projects as well as enforcement procedure for non - compliance with the regulatory framework. Disclosure requirements include details of the project in which the capital raised is deployed or allocated, progress updates on how the project fulfills its core purpose and objectives and benefit to the public at large, and any deviations in the use or allocation of the capital proceeds. This initiative reflects SECs commitment to create an enabling environment for long - term investments in infrastructure projects that support the nations economic growth and development. Chairman SEC, Mr. Faizal Salieh, stated, The misallocation of capital is a root cause of our economic crisis. It is our objective to enable instruments that can raise long - term capital for development projects and provide investor assurance that such capital is allocated to the projects stated purpose with transparency and accountability. We have now created an opportunity for Government bodies such as Municipal Councils, Urban Councils, Local Government Councils, the Urban Development Authority, etc. and even large private sector companies to finance infrastructure projects through these bonds.",

        "date": "January 7, 2024 12:54 pm",
        "content": "The confirmed death toll from the New Years Day earthquake in Japan reached 110 on Saturday as a search for survivors in the rubble of collapsed buildings entered a sixth day. The magnitude 7.6 quake struck the west coast, destroying infrastructure and snapping power links to 22,000 homes in the Hokuriku region. Rain hampered efforts to sift the rubble for survivors as more than 30,000 evacuees awaited aid. The number of confirmed dead was 110 by 4 p.m. (0700 GMT) on Saturday, up from 94 the previous day, the Ishikawa government website showed. More than 200 people are still missing after the deadliest quake in nearly eight years. I am keenly aware of the extent of the damage caused, Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said as the toll crossed 100. The figure is the highest since a toll of 276 in quakes in 2016 in the southwestern region of Kumamoto, a tally that includes related deaths. Kishida told government officials to speed up emergency efforts to restore trunk roads ripped up by the quake so that rescue and relief activities can be increased. Japans Self-Defence Forces is set to reinforce the number of rescue staff by 400 to 5,400, with road disruptions among the obstacles hindering delivery of relief supplies. Mudslides, boulders and road cracks left dozens of remote communities in Ishikawa prefecture isolated. In Wajimas Fukamimachi district, helicopters from the Self-Defence Forces airlifted at least 14 residents to safety, according to a Reuters witness. Freelance cameraman Masao Mochizuki, 73, stood in a long queue outside a supermarket in the regional city of Wajima after it re-opened on Thursday, waiting to buy necessities. It is such a help that they have managed to re-open, Mochizuki told Reuters after buying a box of heat patches, blue plastic sheets to cover broken windows and a pair of shoes to protect against glass shards that litter the floors of his home. But I dont see the road to reconstruction just yet, Mochizuki added, his voice cracking with emotion. SLEEPING IN CARS While the displaced have packed Wajimas evacuation centres for food, water and other basics, some residents are opting to sleep in their cars. The Jan. 1 quakes destroyed the wooden home of Yutaka Obayashi, 75, and wife Akiko, 73. But after a night spent in a makeshift evacuation spot in a community centre, they decided to go home and sleep in their tiny passenger vehicle. Peoples eyes make me very nervous, Obayashi told Reuters, as his wife took a rest in a reclined seat in their car. I just dont like living with many people around me. Weather officials warned of the chance of heavy snowfall in the region from late Sunday through early Monday, which could trigger secondary disasters, such as landslides. Seismic rumbles continue, with an earthquake of intensity 5 on Japans seismic scale in the town of Anamizu early on Saturday. Ayuko Noto, a priest at Wajimas Juzo shrine, whose history dates back 1,300 years, has also chosen to sleep in his car along with family members, even though their house withstood the quakes. That way they hope to protect themselves from further major quakes and possible tsunami waves. Aftershocks are still continuing, said Noto, 47. We are choosing our car over our house so we can flee right away in case another major one strikes. Asked how long they would continue doing that, she replied: I just dont have an answer to that.

        "date": "January 7, 2024 06:00 pm",
        "content": "A trade group representing TikTok, Snapchat, Meta and other major tech companies sued Ohio on Friday over a pending law that requires children to get parental consent to use social media apps. The law was part of an 86.1 billion state budget bill that Republican Gov. Mike DeWine signed into law in July. Its set to take effect Jan. 15. The administration pushed the measure as a way to protect childrens mental health, with Republican Lt. Gov. Jon Husted saying at the time that social media was intentionally addictive and harmful to kids. The NetChoice trade group filed its lawsuit against GOP Attorney General Dave Yost in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio. It seeks to block the law from taking effect. The litigation argues that Ohios law  which requires social media companies to obtain a parents permission for children under 16 to sign up for social media and gaming apps  unconstitutionally impedes free speech and is overbroad and vague. The law also requires social media companies to provide parents with their privacy guidelines, so that families can know what content will be censored or moderated on their childs profile. We at NetChoice believe families equipped with educational resources are capable of determining the best approach to online services and privacy protections for themselves, Chris Marchese, director of the organizations litigation center, said in a statement. With NetChoice v. Yost, we will fight to ensure all Ohioans can embrace digital tools without their privacy, security and rights being thwarted. The group has won lawsuits against similar restrictions in California and Arkansas. Husted, who leads Ohios technology initiatives and championed the law, called Fridays lawsuit cowardly but not unexpected. In filing this lawsuit, these companies are determined to go around parents to expose children to harmful content and addict them to their platforms, Husted said in a statement. He alleged the companies know their algorithms are harming children with catastrophic health and mental health outcomes. Source: The Associated Press --Agencies",

The President concluded by encouraging a shift towards a new economy, achieved through their own efforts. President Wickremesinghe reiterated the importance of unity for the collective effort towards building a prosperous and developed Sri Lanka. He expressed confidence that university students, too, will dedicate themselves to fulfilling this responsibility. President Ranil Wickremesinghe addressed questions from students, and below are some of the queries along with his responses. Question: Tax revenue is the main factor in a countrys income. We study entrepreneurship ideas and entrepreneurship in our university studies. But Mr. President, it does not work in practice. Therefore, we request you to improve the activities for the inclusion of students ideas for entrepreneurial activities. Response: You can establish such a circle in your faculty and connect directly with our finance team. Question: Mr. President, if this program is encouraged to be implemented in all universities, it should be said that it is more suitable. Response: Groups of university students can visit the Treasury for a day or two and study how it works. Question: University students are facing a big problem in pursuing their studies through the English medium. On one occasion, a suicide incident was also reported due to having to engage in studies in English at our university. Therefore, is it possible to make necessary arrangements to improve students English knowledge from the basic level? Response: I think there is no such problem in Colombo University. Such a problem has not arisen in the University of Moratuwa. But all of you should study English. English is an international language. If you work with modern technology such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), you need English knowledge. Many countries in the world, including America, the United Kingdom, Canada, India, conduct work in English. China will probably follow this path in the future. As we have planned to introduce a course on AI in the next two years, it is mandatory to develop the English language knowledge of university students. Accordingly, we expect to facilitate it through the University Grants Commission and, if necessary, institutions such as the British Council. Question: Mr. President, the duration students spend in a government university to attain academic qualifications for degree completion is considerably longer than the time spend in private universities. Consequently, upon entering the job market, individuals from private universities often have more practical experience than their counterparts from government universities. What suggestions do you have to address this discrepancy? Response: I attended a state university, commencing my studies at the age of 18 and completing my degree at 21, subsequently becoming a lawyer at 23. This pertains to an internal matter within the university. Presently, there are disruptions to university education caused by certain individuals. However, during my time at the university, we reached an understanding with the Vice-Chancellor. We agreed that any strikes or protests would be confined to the last two weeks of the first semester, a compromise that was mutually accepted. I believe it is crucial to establish and adhere to a standardized approach to address such issues. Additionally, we anticipate proposing legislation in the future stipulating that students, once admitted to universities, should aim to complete their education within a specified timeframe of three or four years, leading to their timely departure from the university. Notably, this proposed regulation does not apply to medical faculties. Question: Mr. President, may I offer a suggestion? Government schools commonly have synchronized start and end dates. Could we not implement a similar approach for state universities? Response: The academic year for universities traditionally commences in October and concludes on September 30 of the subsequent year. This timing has been consistent, even during my time in university when the academic year also began in October. Its worth noting that in numerous countries, the standard university academic year spans from October to September. Notable attendees included Member of Parliament Mr. Wajira Abeywardena, the Northern Province Governor Ms. P.S.M. Charles, Presidents Secretary Mr. Saman Ekanayake, Presidents Special Projects Director Mr. Theekshana Abeywardena, Presidents Trade Union Director General Mr. Saman Ratnapriya, University Grants Commission Chairman Professor Sampath Amaratunga, Jaffna University Vice-Chancellor Professor S. Sri Srisatkunaraja, Former Vice-Chancellor Professor Vasanthy Arasaratnam and a group of university students actively participated in this event. --PMD--",

        "content": "Minister of Transport, Highways and Mass Media Bandula Gunawardena and High Commissioner of India to Sri Lanka Santosh Jha ceremonially launched track rehabilitation work at Galgamuwa Railway Station commencing upgradation of railway line including ancillary works from Maho to Anuradhapura on Sunday (Jan. 07). The upgradation of the from Maho to Anuradhapura on the mainline is the second phase of a Line of Credit project for track rehabilitation from Maho- Omanthai (128Km) which was undertaken by an Indian Public Sector company, IRCON, under an Indian Line of Credit (LOC) of USD 318 million, the Indian High Commission in Colombo said in a statement. The cost of the entire project is USD 91.27 million of which the second phase of rehabilitation from Maho-Anuradhapura is scheduled to be completed in a period of six months, it mentioned. State Minister of Mass Media Shantha Bandara and senior officials from the Sri Lankan Ministry of Transport were also present at the event, according to the Indian High Commission in Sri Lanka. Speaking during the event, Minister of Transport Bandula Gunawardena expressed gratitude to India for the support extended to Sri Lanka, especially in the transport sector. Appreciating the work carried out by IRCON in Sri Lanka in the past few years, he also called for greater Railway cooperation between the two countries. The High Commissioner expressed happiness that as a long-standing development partner of Sri Lanka, India had executed projects for development and rehabilitation of Sri Lankas Northern and Southern Railway line over the past several years, in line with the priorities and requirements of the Government of Sri Lanka. He underscored the importance of modernization of Railways in enhancing mobility of goods and services in Sri Lanka thereby boosting economic activity. Railways has been one of the priority sectors for Government of Indias assistance to Sri Lanka, the statement said, adding that till date, India has executed projects of over USD 1 billion in the Railways sector under 5 Indian LOCs. Indias public sector company, IRCON, started its operations in Sri Lanka in March 2009 and has contributed towards modernization of Sri Lanka Railways by reconstructing the entire railway line network in Northern Province (253 Km) and upgradation of Southern line (115 km). It has also contributed to ensuring safety and reliability through a modern signaling  telecommunication system on 330 km stretch of Railway line, it added. Furthermore, the Indian High Commission in Colombo mentioned it is notable that Indias support to Sri Lanka under its various LOCs has continued despite the debt standstill announced by the Government of Sri Lanka in April 2022. In September 2023, the Ministry of Transport and Highways of Sri Lanka and IRCON International signed a new Contract for design, installation, testing, and commissioning of a Signalling system for Sri Lanka Railways, from Maho to Anuradhapura at a cost of USD 14.90 million under an Indian LOC, it added",

        "content": "Several internal issues have arisen within the main opposition Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) as a result of MPs from other political parties crossing over and joining the SJB, political sources said. It was seen that a number of politicians representing opposition parties as well as several MPs representing the ruling party had joined the SJB during the last few days. However, some of the newly joined members are reportedly being opposed by the members who have been within the party so far. It is stated that the main reason for this is that the competition for representing the Parliament from the party intensified with the addition of new MPs to the party. Nevertheless, it was reported that although several politicians joined the alliance of the SJB, the party has only provided the SJBs membership to Jayarathne Herath, Chandima Weerakkody, Shan Wijayalal and Dayasritha Tissera. When inquired by Ada Derana in this regard, a leading member of the SJB stated that despite the existence of different ideologies, the party is working to resolve the issues through discussions.

        "date": "January 8, 2024 10:52 am",
        "content": "Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina swept to a fourth straight term as expected with her party winning an absolute majority in the general election, the poll body said on Monday, amid low turnout in the vote boycotted by the main opposition. The main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), who participated in the 2018 vote but kept away in 2014, boycotted the polls after Hasina refused their demands to resign and allow a neutral authority to run the general election. The daughter of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, founding father of Bangladesh who was killed in an army coup in 1975 along with most members of the family, Hasina, 76, first became prime minister in 1996. This will be her fifth term overall. In her past 15 years in power she has been credited with turning around the economy and the massive garments industry, while winning international praise for sheltering Rohingya Muslims fleeing persecution in neighbouring Myanmar. Bangladeshis largely stayed away from Sundays election, which was marred by violence. Turnout was about 40 when polls closed, said chief election commissioner Kazi Habibul Awal, compared with over 80 in the last election in 2018. The ruling Awami League party won 167 seats out of 227 seats with the outcome of the rest of the seats still to be announced, according to unofficial results released by the Election Commission. Hasina herself bagged 249,962 votes from her constituency Gopalganj, about 165 kilometres (103 miles) south of the capital Dhaka, while her nearest rival secured just 469 votes. Rights groups warned of a virtual one-party rule by Hasinas Awami League in the South Asian country of 170 million people while the United States and Western nations, key customers of Bangladeshs garment industry, had called for a free and fair election, the 12th since independence from Pakistan in 1971. I am trying my best to ensure that democracy should continue in this country, Hasina said on Sunday after casting her vote, adding that her only accountability was to citizens of Bangladesh. She has instructed party leaders and supporters not to bring out any victory processions or indulge in celebrations, said Awami Leagues general secretary Obaidul Quader. Polls were held for 299 directly elected parliamentary seats with close to 120 million voters eligible to choose from nearly 2,000 contestants. Election to one seat will be held at a later date after an independent contestant died ahead of the vote due to natural causes. Among the ruling party winners were actor Ferdous Ahmed and former Bangladesh cricket captains Shakib Al Hasan and Mashrafe Mortaza. Independent candidates, many of them Awami League party members of various ranks, won 49 seats. The BNP has accused the ruling party of propping up dummy independent candidates to try to make the election look credible, a claim the Awami League has denied. The BNP called a two-day strike nationwide through Sunday, asking people to shun the election, and said the low turnout was a success for their boycott call. Hasina has accused the opposition of instigating anti-government protests that have rocked Dhaka since late October and killed at least 14 people. At least four people were killed on Friday in a passenger train fire that the government called arson. Several polling booths, schools and a Buddhist monastery were also set ablaze days before the poll. Critics accuse Hasina of authoritarianism, human rights violations, crackdowns on free speech and suppression of dissent. The economy has also slowed sharply since the Russia-Ukraine war pushed up prices of fuel and food imports, forcing Bangladesh to turn last year to the International Monetary Fund for a 4.7 billion bailout.

        "date": "January 8, 2024 12:18 pm",
        "content": "Historical drama Oppenheimer dominated the Golden Globe awards on Sunday, and gothic comedy Poor Things upset summer blockbuster Barbie, as Hollywood threw its biggest party since labor disputes shut down much of show business last year. Oppenheimer, about the making of the atomic bomb, landed five honors, including the coveted best movie drama prize and acting awards for stars Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey Jr. Christopher Nolan won his first Golden Globe award for best director for the film, which was distributed by Comcasts Universal Pictures. I am so pleased that Chris has been acknowledged because I just think that what he does is unlike anything anyone else is doing, Oppenheimer producer Emma Thomas said on stage. She said Nolan, who is her husband, brings the best out in people by being the very best himself. Poor Things, starring Emma Stone as a deceased woman revived by scientists, won best movie musical or comedy. Awards watchers had widely expected that honor to go to Barbie, the female empowerment story inspired by the iconic doll that topped 2023 box office charts and went into the night with a leading nine nominations. Stone also was named best actress in a movie comedy or musical. Barbie went home with just two awards, for Billie Eilishs song What Was I Made For and for a new category called cinematic and box office achievement, created for widely seen films. The winners were chosen by roughly 300 entertainment journalists who voted on the honors as a part of a new organization created after an ethics and diversity scandal among Globe voters. Lily Gladstone, best actress winner for her role in Killers of the Flower Moon began her acceptance speech by introducing herself in the Native American language she learned in school. This is an historic win, Gladstone continued in English. It doesnt belong to just me. I am holding it right now with all my beautiful sisters. She thanked director Martin Scorsese as well as Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert De Niro, her co-stars in the story about the murders of members of the Osage Nation in the 1920s. You are all changing things, Gladstone said. Other acting winners included Paul Giamatti and DaVine Joy Randolph for The Holdovers, a comedy set at a boys boarding school. In television categories, Succession was named best drama and led all series with four wins, including a lead acting honor for Kieran Culkin. Suck it, Pedro! Culkin joked to competitor Pedro Pascal from The Last of Us. The Bear, about the struggles of owning a restaurant, won best TV comedy and acting trophies for stars Jeremy Allen White and Ayo Edebiri. Road-rage story Beef landed the Globe for limited series. The glitzy ceremony at the Beverly Hilton kicked off Hollywoods annual awards season, which culminates with the Oscars on March 10, and brought top stars together for the first time after six months of strikes by actors and writers in 2023. The event gave performers the chance to mingle and to publicize their movies and TV shows after months when red carpets and other promotion was prohibited. Jo Koy, a comedian hosting his first major awards show, opened the ceremony, broadcast live on CBS, with jabs at some of the A-list stars and their projects. Oppenheimer, a historical drama running three hours long, needed another hour, Koy joked. I felt like it needed some more backstory. Known as a boozy celebration more relaxed than the Academy Awards, the Globes nearly disappeared. A 2021 Los Angeles Times report revealed ethical lapses and a lack of diversity among the roughly 80 members of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, the group that previously voted on the Globes. The 2022 ceremony was scrapped while the organization made reforms. Sundays turnout showed Hollywood had re-embraced the Globes as a key stop on the awards campaign trail. In the crowd were several Hollywood legends from Meryl Streep to Robert De Niro and Jodie Foster, all Globe nominees vying for Oscars this year. Pop superstar Taylor Swift joined the crowd as a nominee for her recent concert film. Oprah Winfrey presented the nights top prize to Oppenheimer. Several winners commented that the talent in the room made the crowd intimidating. I cant believe Im in this room with all these people I have loved so much, admired so much, for so long, The Bear star White said as he accepted his award. Its unreal. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "date": "January 8, 2024 12:38 pm",
        "content": "Japan restated the importance for early completion of signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between Sri Lanka and creditor nations on debt restructuring, after an agreement was reached in principle late last year. It also emphasised the need to ensure transparency and comparability in agreements with creditors outside the Official Creditor Committee (OCC), according to a statement dated Friday. Japan, along with France and India, co-chair the committee of 15 creditor nations. Battling its worst financial crisis since independence in 1948, the South Asian island nation is trying to restructure deals with creditors after soaring inflation, currency depreciation and low foreign reserves sent its economy into free fall, forcing it to default on foreign debt in May 2022. Sri Lanka and its creditors said in November they reached an agreement in principle on debt restructuring that would cover approximately 5.9 billion of outstanding public debt and consisted of a mix of long-term maturity extension and reduction in interest rates. China, Sri Lankas largest bilateral creditor, has struck its own deal with the island nation, but has not joined OCC as a formal member. Sri Lankas total external debt is estimated at 36.4 billion, which includes 10.81 billion of bilateral debt, according to data released by its finance ministry in September. Sri Lanka needs to secure debt restructuring agreements with both bilateral creditors and bondholders, possibly by March, to complete the second review of a 2.9 billion bailout from the International Monetary Fund.

        "date": "January 8, 2024 02:01 pm",
        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe highlighted the need for a program similar to the initiatives undertaken by the late Mr. D.B. Jayathilaka, which played a crucial role in establishing a strong foundation in Sri Lanka across social, cultural, religious and educational aspects through citizen participation. During his address at the 125th-anniversary ceremony of the Colombo Young Mens Buddhist Association (YMBA) at the Bandaranaike International Conference Hall in Colombo yesterday afternoon (07), the President emphasized the importance of collective progress as one Sri Lankan nation, with a focus on the future rather than the present. The Colombo YMBA, founded under the chairmanship of Sir Anagarika Dharmapala on January 8, 1898, with Mr. D.B. Jayatilaka as its founding chairman, stands as the oldest and largest Buddhist organization in the country, contributing significantly to Sri Lankas broader mission. The theme of this years anniversary event was Discourse for One Sri Lanka. During the commemorative ceremony, the President received the launch of a special issue marking the 125th anniversary, and he awarded scholarships to ten university students. A group photo featuring the President, heads of the association, members of the governing board and members of the working committee was also taken. President Ranil Wickremesinghe, offering additional remarks, acknowledged the historical significance of the Colombo YMBA, stating that it played a pivotal role in shaping the history of Sri Lanka. President Wickremesinghe further said; The Colombo Youth Buddhist Association has reached a significant milestone of 125 years since its inception. Undoubtedly, this association holds a pivotal place in Sri Lankas history, as it emerged during a period when Christian youth societies were being established in Western countries. In contrast, we, during that time, were actively involved in the Buddhist renaissance. Visionary leaders such as Ven. Sri Sumangala Thera of Hikkaduwa and Colonel Henry Steel Olcott played key roles in spearheading the Buddhist renaissance in our nation. It was against this backdrop that we initiated the worlds first Young Mens Buddhist Association (YMBA). The mission of this association diverges from that of Western countries, focusing on advancing the country through Buddhist education. Spearheaded by Mr. D. B. Jayathilaka, this association has played a pivotal role in supporting the Kelaniya Rajamaha Viharaya. We recognize the Young Buddhist Association as a significant force in our freedom movement, and in celebration of its 125th anniversary, I intend to extend a gesture. The government-owned land in Colombo Fort is granted to the association for an additional 99 years, with plans to develop it into a tourist area. The theme for the 125th anniversary, One Sri Lanka Discourse, aligns with the countrys current needs. The goal is to address all war-related issues by 2025, providing political solutions for the displaced and missing persons. Furthermore, there are plans to enhance the religious centre in Nagadeepa and establish a distinctive Hindu temple in Jaffna, emphasizing the importance of collective progress. Engaging with the youth is crucial; their input, plans and ideas are essential for nation-building. Looking beyond the present, we aim to recreate the kind of arrangement initiated by Mr. Jayathilaka. A comprehensive national plan, uniting everyone to move forward collectively, is imperative for the countrys future. Sri Lanka has a rich history as an agriculture-centric nation. The emphasis now is on ensuring the safe export of our food crops through sustainable agricultural practices, requiring concerted efforts. Simultaneously, the Anti-Corruption Commission has been established, with a dedicated committee appointed by the Legislative Assembly. Going beyond local financial regulations, we have submitted a comprehensive report on financial control in alignment with the International Monetary Fund agreement. This report encompasses aspects such as tendering processes and expenditure guidelines. A parliamentary commission is anticipated to implement these recommendations, emphasizing the need for diligent work by government financial officers. Addressing the political landscape, there is a call for regulations governing political parties, with a committee studying global political processes. This plays a crucial role in shaping our political framework. To engage globally, collaboration with other nations is essential. Free trade agreements, such as the one with Singapore already signed, are crucial. Ongoing negotiations with India and China are underway, and agreements with Thailand are expected to be finalized in April, marking a significant milestone for the country. Future discussions with Myanmar are scheduled, maintaining diplomatic ties despite challenges. It is crucial to foster relations with Laos and Vietnam, opening our economy to the world, drawing inspiration from their successful examples. Even amid conventional perspectives, the call is for unity to advance with a shared economic program, much like the remarkable economic progress seen in Cambodia over a short period. The current president of the Colombo YMBA, Mr. Mahendra Jayasekara, It is with great pride that I stand before you to speak on the momentous occasion of the 125th anniversary of the Colombo Young Mens Buddhist Association. Recognized as the worlds oldest and most significant association, it was founded in 1898 under the leadership of Sir D.B. Jayathilaka, alongside influential figures like C.S. Dissanayake, a young Catholic. The Colombo YMBA, emerging from the vision of these pioneering individuals, has played a pivotal role in fostering national and religious unity since its inception. Notably, strong national figures like D.S. Senanayake and Sir Ernest Silva were nurtured in the influential environment of the Colombo YMBA. The formation of the National Council in 1919-1920, initiated by the association, further solidified its impact on national politics, involving leaders from diverse backgrounds. Over the course of 125 years, the Colombo YMBA has been instrumental in shaping national leadership. Our collective purpose remains clear  to build a prosperous nation through the cultivation of national unity and religious harmony. It is imperative that we engage in discussions to rectify past mistakes, fostering a collective effort to move forward. The success of our endeavours to advance the country hinges on our ability to unite people in dialogue, determining the necessary framework for achieving prosperity. The event was attended by a diverse and distinguished gathering, including the Acting Mahanayake of Sri Lanka Amarapura Maha Nikaya, President of Sri Lanka Amarapura Maha Sangha, Scholar Venerable Karagoda Uyangoda Maitrimurthi Maha Nayaka Thero, and the Chief Prelate of the Atkanda Rajamaha Viharaya, Venerable Anamaduve Sri Dhammadassi Anunayake of the Asgiri Vihara Mahavihara Vamsika Shyamopali Maha Nikaya and other Maha Sangha. The attendees also comprised leaders from various religious backgrounds, including representatives from Hindu, Catholic, and Islamic faiths. Former Presidents Mahinda Rajapaksa and Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga, former Speaker Karu Jayasuriya, Minister of State Chamara Sampath Dasanayake, Members of Parliament Rajitha Senaratne and Tissa Attanayake, as well as the President of the Governing Board of the Colombo YMBA, Ajitha De Soysa, and Prasantha Abeykoon, Secretary, were also present. The event was further graced by the participation of foreign ambassadors, academicians, professionals, artists and other distinguished invitees. --PMD--",

        "date": "January 8, 2024 03:22 pm",
        "content": "One of Indias largest travel platforms suspended flight bookings to the tourism-dependent Maldives on Monday after disparaging social media posts against Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi embittered relations between the South Asian neighbours. India and Russia send the largest number of visitors to the Maldives, a chain of sun-kissed islands in the Indian Ocean that is home to many luxury resorts. Tourism accounts for almost one-third of its economy, according to the World Bank. EaseMyTrip co-founder and Executive Director Prashant Pitti said bookings to the Maldives were suspended indefinitely. Even though New Delhi and Male have traditionally had close ties, relations have been tense since President Mohamed Muizzu came to power in November winning the election on an India Out campaign. The controversy over comments by three Maldivian now-suspended-ministers about Modi comes just as Muizzu embarks for China on his first state visit from Jan. 8-12, breaking from the convention of most Maldivian leaders choosing New Delhi to be their first international port of call. Both Beijing and New Delhi vie for influence in the Indian Ocean nation. We decided to take this step because any self-respecting nation should do this. The statements which we heard from the representatives of the Maldives government were extremely derogatory to the country, Pitti told Reuters. Pitti said EaseMyTrip is the second largest online travel booking platform in India with a 22 market share. The Maldives government suspended deputy ministers Malsha Shareef, Mariyam Shiuna and Abdulla Mahzoom Majid for calling Modi a clown, terrorist and puppet of Israel on social media platform X, in response to a video of him visiting the Indian islands of Lakshadweep, north of the Maldives, to promote local tourism. Pitti said his company will promote Lakshadweep over any foreign location, even though EaseMyTrip might witness a temporary dip in international tourism. Many Indians, including some celebrities, shared social media posts promoting domestic destinations over the Maldives. New Delhi has summoned Maldivian envoy Ibrahim Shaheeb, a day after Indias mission in Male strongly raised and expressed concerns with the Maldivian foreign ministry on Sunday, a source aware of the matter said. Indian High Commissioner to the Maldives Munu Mahawar also held a pre-arranged meeting with the Maldivian foreign ministry on Monday, the Indian mission said on X. Tourism is the largest foreign exchange earner for the Maldives, with India and Russia sending the most visitors, around 209,000 each last year. Maldives is targeting 2 million arrivals for 2024.

        "content": "An appeal filed challenging the decision of the Court of Appeal to dismiss the petition, filed seeking the disqualification of State Minister Diana Gamages parliamentary seat, has been fixed for consideration on January 19, 2024. The appeal which was put forward by social activist Oshala Herath was taken up before a Supreme Court judge bench led by Justice Yasantha Kodagoda today (Jan. 08). Social activist Oshala Herath had filed the relevant appeal two weeks after the petition he had filed over Diana Gamages parliamentary seat and citizenship was dismissed by the Appeals Court. Naming State Minister Gamage and several others as the respondent of his appeal, Herath said he had previously filed a petition alleging that the lawmaker is unqualified to hold the position of a member of parliament in Sri Lanka, as she also holds dual citizenship. However, a three-member judge bench of the Appeals Court delivered a split decision on October 31, 2023 and dismissed the petition, subject to a fee. Accordingly, Herath has sought a Supreme Court order determining that the Appeals Court ruling is unlawful and that State Minister Gamage is not qualified to hold parliamentary seat.",

        "date": "January 8, 2024 04:10 pm",
        "content": "Economists expect Sri Lankas central bank to pause now but resume its rate cut cycle in the second quarter of this year to bolster the island nations recovery after an unprecedented crisis. The standing lending facility rate, currently at 10, is seen to stay on hold for a quarter and be followed by a cut of 50 basis points in the April-June period, according to the latest median estimates in a Bloomberg survey. After reducing borrowing costs by 650 basis points last year, Sri Lankas central bank signaled it will pause as the economy gradually turns around and inflation bottoms out. While the economy is now recovering from the political and economic crisis, it remains very weak, with output around 20 below its pre-crisis peak, said Gareth Leather, economist at Capital Economics. The central bank will keep monetary policy unchanged at its next review, but the pause wont last for long, he said, penciling rate cuts of 200 basis points this year. With demand gathering pace, analysts expect consumer prices to inch up. The survey showed economists raising their outlook on headline inflation through 2024, with the first and second quarters forecasts at 6 and 7, respectively. The International Monetary Fund has so far disbursed a total of 670 million under its bailout plan, helping Sri Lanka in overcoming shortages of food, fuel and raw materials. Authorities are in the process of restructuring the nations debt to secure more funds. Sri Lankas economy is seen to expand 3.3 this year from a contraction of 2.5 in 2023, the survey showed.

The electoral triumph achieved by the Awami League is a testament to the trust and confidence bestowed by the people of Bangladesh in Prime Minister Sheikh Hasinas capable leadership. President Wickremesinghe expressed confidence that her wisdom and wealth of experience will continue to benefit the people of Bangladesh. Highlighting the close and friendly bilateral relations between Sri Lanka and Bangladesh, President Wickremesinghe expressed his firm conviction that this multi-faceted relationship will be further strengthened and consolidated in the years ahead during Prime Minister Sheikh Hasinas tenure. In this regard, he extended an invitation for Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina to undertake a visit to Sri Lanka at a mutually convenient date, which could be agreed upon through diplomatic channels. President Wickremesinghe is confident that such a visit will significantly enhance the political and economic interaction between Sri Lanka and Bangladesh, reinforcing existing ties for the mutual benefit of the two nations. President Wickremesinghe took this opportunity to recall, with deep appreciation, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasinas personal intervention and the crucial support that the Government of Bangladesh has been extending to Sri Lanka, particularly in the recent past.

        "date": "January 8, 2024 07:11 pm",
        "content": "State Minister for Finance Ranjith Siyambalapitiya emphasized that while Sri Lanka has 01 million individuals with the financial capacity to pay income tax, only 500,000 are presently meeting this obligation. The State Minister stressed the importance of incorporating the remaining 500,000 tax evaders into the tax system, with the goal of decreasing indirect taxes and increasing the direct tax rate, the Presidents Media Division (PMD) said in a statement. State Minister underscored that in developed nations, being a taxpayer is acknowledged as a sign of a robust citizen actively contributing to the nations stability. He also expressed optimism that the citizens of this country will undergo a positive shift in attitude, thereby fostering development within the nation. These remarks were revealed by State Minister for Finance, Mr. Ranjith Siyambalapitiya, addressing the news conference at the Presidential Media Centre (PMD) today (08) under the theme Collective path to a stable country. The State Minister also announced that preparations are underway to commence the implementation of the Tax Identification Number (TIN) number from February 01, it added. State Minister Ranjith Siambalapitiya further stated: At the end of 2019, the number of tax files stood at 1,705,233, which decreased to 437,547 by the end of 2022. However, with the new policies of our government, we have successfully increased the number of tax files to 1,002,029 by December 31, 2023. Nevertheless, there is a need for further increase in that figure. Additionally, by the end of last year, the state revenue, which was 8 as a percentage of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP), has successfully increased to 10. The government aims to further elevate it to 12 by the end of 2024 and set a target of reaching 15 by the year 2025 to establish a country with a stable economy. Moreover, amendments have been introduced for Value Added Tax (VAT). The VAT rate, previously at 15, has been increased to 18, and the VAT limit, previously set at Rs. 80 million, will now be decreased to Rs.60 million. Since the introduction of the VAT Act in 2001, all goods and services were initially subject to VAT, but subsequent tax amendment acts gradually exempted certain items. In the latest amendment, 97 out of 138 exempted goods and services have been re-added. The government anticipates that the VAT revision will contribute an additional 2.07 to the state revenue as a percentage of the general gross domestic product, amounting to Rs.645 billion. The Economic Research Division of the Central Bank has analysed that the increase in tax rates may lead to a 2.5 rise in inflation. However, the Central Bank and the Ministry of Finance express confidence that, with the reduction in the electricity bill, inflation can be brought back to 5 within two or three months. It is crucial for everyone to bear in mind that we are striving to maintain a 5 inflation rate in a country currently facing a 70 inflation rate. Despite this challenging situation, the government has worked diligently to increase the salaries and pensions of public service workers, showcasing the unique aspect of our financial management capabilities. Presently, direct taxes constitute 30, while indirect taxes make up 70 of the tax structure. Our objective is to shift this balance and raise the direct tax rate to 40. This adjustment aligns with the conditions of developed countries and promotes social justice. In a population of 01 million capable taxpayers, only 500,000 individuals are currently fulfilling this obligation. Identifying tax evaders and bringing them into the tax net is crucial to reduce indirect taxes. Preparations are underway to implement the TIN system starting from the February 01. Registration issues are currently being encountered, primarily because this is a new experience for the people. Efforts are being made to address these challenges at the Divisional Secretariat level, with the intention of resolving them through an online system. Recognizing a taxpayer as a strong citizen contributing to a countrys stability is a principle upheld in developed countries. It is imperative for the people to embrace this change in attitude for the overall development of the country. Therefore, the success of this program relies on the contribution of each individual.",

        "content": "(Reuters) - The United States shares the view that the weekends elections in Bangladesh were not free and fair, the U.S. State Department said on Monday, adding that Washington was concerned by reports of vote irregularities and condemned violence that took place. Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina swept to a fourth straight term in power, with her party winning almost 75 of the seats in Sundays general election. But the main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) boycotted the vote and turnout was low. The United States remains concerned by the arrests of thousands of political opposition members and by reports of irregularities on elections day, a U.S. State Department spokesperson said on Monday. The United States shares the view with other observers that these elections were not free or fair and we regret that not all parties participated. The ruling Awami League party won 222 seats out of 298, according to unofficial results released by the Election Commission. The election was Bangladeshs 12th since independence from Pakistan in 1971. Rights groups have warned of a virtual one-party rule by Hasinas Awami League in the South Asian country of 170 million people. The daughter of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, founding father of Bangladesh, Hasina, 76, first became prime minister in 1996. Hasina played down the oppositions boycott and said her aim was to boost the economy. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "title": "French prime minister resigns following recent political turmoil over immigration",
        "date": "January 9, 2024 11:38 am",
        "content": "French Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne resigned Monday following recent political turmoil over immigration, paving the way for President Emmanuel Macron to seek fresh momentum by appointing a new government in the coming days. The shakeup was widely seen as an attempt by the 46-year-old centrist Macron to head off a looming lame-duck status. Macrons term is to end in 2027, and he wont be able to run for president for a consecutive third term in line with the French Constitution. In her resignation letter, Borne suggested she resigned at Macrons request, citing the presidents will to appoint a new prime minister. Bornes resignation followed the passage late last month of contentious immigration legislation backed by Macron aimed at strengthening the governments ability to deport some foreigners, among other measures. Macrons centrist alliance was able to pass the measure only after making a deal with the conservative Republicans party, which many observers saw as the governments shift to the right. The tough negotiations and heated parliament debate raised questions over the ability of Bornes government to pass future major bills. Political observers also suggested that Macron, a staunch supporter of European integration, wants his new government to get ready for Junes European Union elections. Borne, 62, had been appointed in May 2022 after Macrons reelection for a second term. She was Frances second female prime minister. The following month, Macrons centrists lost their majority in parliament, forcing the government into political maneuvering and using special constitutional powers to be able to pass laws. Last year, Borne faced mass protests often marred by violence against unpopular pension changes. The bill to increase the retirement age from 62 to 64 was enacted into law in April, angering many people across the country. She also faced days of riots which erupted across France at the beginning of the summer, triggered by the deadly police shooting of a teen. Macrons office announced his acceptance of Bornes resignation in a statement, and the president posted on X, formerly Twitter, that Bornes work has been exemplary every day. You have implemented our project with statewomens courage, commitment and determination. Thank you from the bottom of my heart, he wrote. The statement from Macrons office said Borne will continue in her duties until a new government is appointed. French media outlets reported Monday evening that Education Minister Gabriel Attal, 34, was the favorite for the job. If named, he would be the youngest prime minister in Frances modern history. Other names often mentioned include Minister for the Armed Forces Sébastien Lecornu and former Agriculture Minister Julien Denormandie, a longtime supporter of Macron who helped him launch his political movement. Under the French political system, the prime minister is appointed by the president and accountable to the parliament. The prime minister is in charge of implementing domestic policy and coordinating the governments team of ministers. The president holds substantial powers over foreign policy, European affairs and defense. He is also the commander-in-chief of the countrys armed forces. Source: Associated Press -Agencies",

Accordingly, the relevant injunction order was extended until 23 January, on orders of Colombo Additional District Judge Chamari Weerasuriya, when the case was taken up in court this morning (09 Jan.). The All-Ceylon General Ports Employees Union initially planned to launch a work-to-rule campaign on 28 December 2023, demanding an increase in salaries. On 27 December 2023, however, the Colombo District Court issued an enjoining order against the trade unions of the Ports Authority, preventing them from staging a token strike that would disrupt the operations of the Colombo Port. Despite the court having effectively prohibited the trade unions from conducting their planned trade union action, Chief Secretary of the General Ports Employees Union, Niroshan Gorakana had charged that the unions members intend on resorting to yet another trade union action after 09 January 2024.",

        "title": "South Korea passes new law banning dog meat trade",
        "date": "January 9, 2024 12:26 pm",
        "content": "South Korea has passed a new law, which aims to end the slaughter and selling of dogs for their meat by 2027. The law aims to end the centuries-old practice of eating dog meat. Dog meat has fallen out of favour with diners over the past few decades. Young people especially shun it. Under the law, raising or slaughtering dogs for consumption will be banned, as will distributing or selling dog meat. Those found guilty of doing so could be sent to jail. Those butchering dogs could face up to three years in prison, while those who raise dogs for meat or sell dog meat could serve a maximum of two years. However, the consumption of dog meat itself will not be illegal. The new legislation will come into effect in three years time, giving farmers and restaurant owners time to find alternative sources of employment and income. They will have to submit a plan to phase out their businesses to their local authorities. The government has promised to fully support dog meat farmers, butchers and restaurant owners, whose businesses will be forced to close, though the details of what compensation will be offered have yet to be worked through. According to government statistics, South Korea had around 1,600 dog meat restaurants and 1,150 dog farms in 2023. Dog meat stew, called boshintang, is considered a delicacy among some older South Koreans, but the meat is no longer popular with young people. According to a Gallup poll last year, only 8 of people said they had tried dog meat in the past 12 months, down from 27 in 2015. Less than a fifth of those polled said they supported the consumption of the meat. Previous governments, dating back to the 1980s, have pledged to ban dog meat, but failed to make progress. The current President Yoon Suk Yeol and the First Lady Kim Keon Hee are known animal lovers. The couple owns six dogs, and Ms Kim has called for the practice of eating dogs to end. Animal rights groups, which have long been pushing for the ban, praised the outcome of Tuesdays vote. Jung Ah Chae, the executive director of the Humane Society in Korea, said she was surprised to see the ban in her lifetime. While my heart breaks for all the millions of dogs for whom this change has come too late, I am overjoyed that South Korea can now close this miserable chapter in our history and embrace a dog friendly future, she said. Dog meat farmers had campaigned against the ban. They argued that, given the declining popularity among young people, the practice should be allowed to die out naturally over time. Many farmers and restaurateurs are elderly and said it would be difficult for them to switch livelihoods so late in life. One dog farmer, Joo Yeong-bong, told the BBC the industry was in despair. In 10 years, the industry would have disappeared. Were in our 60s and 70s and now we have no choice but to lose our livelihoods, he said, adding that this was an infringement of peoples freedom to eat what they like. Source: BBC -Agencies",
