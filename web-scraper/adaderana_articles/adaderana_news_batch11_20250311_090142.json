        "date": "May 16, 2024 02:57 pm",
        "content": "Consultant Community Physician Dr. Sherine Balasingham of the Health Ministrys Directorate of Non-Communicable Disease says that the number of patients with high blood pressure reported in Sri Lanka has increased. She revealed that following a survey carried out covering all districts in the island on the adult population between the ages 18-69 years, it was reported that 35 of them are suffering from hypertension. She further stated that several programmes are held globally each year on May 17 to raise awareness on high blood pressure and on the third week of May regarding salt intake. Dr. Balasingham stated that a survey is also conducted in Sri Lanka once every 5 years and that according to the statistics of the last survey conducted in 2021, 35 of the individuals who took part in the survey had high blood pressure. She added that the recommended sodium intake by an adult is 05 grams per day, however the survey has revealed that the daily intake of sodium by an adult is around 14.2 grams per day, which is three times more than the recommended amount. Expressing her opinion regarding the prevention of high blood pressure, she stated that to maintain good health, it is important to reduce the amount of salt used in food as well to eat healthy. It is also important to increase physical activities to mitigate mental stress. Dr. Balasingham also emphasized the importance of voiding the use of tobacco and alcohol as well as measuring your blood pressure frequently. Especially those above the age of 35 years who have not measured their blood pressure yet, should measure it immediately, she said.",

        "date": "May 16, 2024 07:11 pm",
        "content": "State Minister of Small and Medium Enterprises Development Prasanna Ranaweera has reportedly assaulted a Porter at the Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) in Katunayake. Meanwhile, the State Minister has also threatened several security officers at the airport, according to sources. Accompanied by his ministerial security personnel, Ranaweera had visited the airport with his wife in the early hours of Tuesday (May 14) as his spouse was scheduled to travel overseas. The state minister had attempted to enter the airport through its main entrance along with his ministerial security officers who were carrying firearms, sources said. At that moment, the airport security officers have informed the state minister that they could not allow the ministerial security officers to enter the airport while carrying the firearms. The state minister had then allegedly proceeded to verbally abuse the airport security officers. Airport sources said State Minister Prasanna Ranaweera had later also assaulted the porter who was pushing the trolley carrying the luggage of the state ministers wife. An incident in which the porter in question had objected to the state minister paying him a sum of only Rs. 700, despite signs at the airport clearly stating that a porter should be paid a fee of Rs. 1,000, is said to have led to the assault incident. The state minister had reportedly left the airport premises after slapping the porter in the face. The airport employee n question, a resident of Kurunegala, had then visited the airport police station to lodge a complaint regarding the incident. However, due to the absence of the officer-in-charge (OIC) at that time, the police officers present had informed the porter to return the next morning. But the assaulted porter has reportedly not visited the police station after that. Ada Derana inquired from State Minister Prasanna Ranaweera regarding this incident. I got angry at that time. I called him and pulled him to the side. I slapped him, thats true, the state minister admitted. The website of the Bandaranaike International Airport states the following regarding its Porter service: Passengers, who wish to obtain the services of Porters, could do so at the departure outer porch and arrival baggage claim area. A fee has been approved for them by the AASL and they have been advised to offer this service up-to the check-in counters at Departures and up to the outer porch at Arrivals. Rs. 1000.00 per passenger (for maximum 04 baggages only) and Rs. 250.00 for additional baggage for both Arrival and Departure round the clock.",

        "date": "May 16, 2024 09:46 pm",
        "content": "The resumption of the passenger ferry service between Nagapattinam in India and the Kankesanthurai region near Jaffna in the Northern Province of Sri Lanka has been delayed again for an indefinite period, Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva has said. The passenger ferry service between Nagapattinam in Tamil Nadu and Kankesanthurai (KKS) suburb of Jaffna district, which was to resume on May 13, was delayed due to a technical shortcoming, de Silva said on Wednesday. The nature of the technical shortcoming was not revealed by the minister. The service, launched in October last year after nearly 40 years, was halted a few days later owing to rough weather. Since then, the resumption of the service, which is a vital component of India-Sri Lanka maritime cooperation, has been delayed three times. India has also extended a grant assistance of USD 63.65 million -- the entire project cost -- to Sri Lanka to rehabilitate the Kankesanthurai Port in the Northern Province. Situated in the northern region of Sri Lanka, the Kankesanthurai Port or the KKS Port, with an area of approximately 16 acres, is located at a distance of 104 kilometres (56 nautical miles) from Karaikal Port in Pondicherry. The direct passenger ship service connecting Nagapattinam in Tamil Nadu to Kankesanthurai port near Jaffna covers a distance of 111 kilometres (60 nautical miles) in approximately three and a half hours. The ferry service will be operated by a private operator, IndSri Ferry Services, selected by the Shipping Corporation of India (SCI) in consultation with the Government of Sri Lanka (GOSL).

        "content": "A British towns new mayor is a refugee from Sri Lanka who will be the first Hindu to hold the position. Labour councillor Elango Elavalakan has taken over the ceremonial role after a unanimous vote at Ipswich Borough Councils annual meeting. Im so happy today, and very proud to be mayor of this great town, said Mr Elavalakan. Council leader Neil MacDonald, who proposed the nomination, said Mr Elavalakan would get to read out a general election result during his year in office. The announcement by a refugee who fled war and persecution, and who has made a new life and contributed to society here, will send a message, he said. Members of Ipswichs Hindu community attended Wednesday evenings ceremony, with celebrations at the nearby temple planned for later in the week. Dr Sachin Karale, chair of Ipswich Hindu Samaj, said: It shows the great diversity and multiculturalism of Ipswich town that a Hindu man is becoming mayor. Im really proud. Mr Elavalakans wife, Manchula Elavalakan, will be his consort. The mayors theme for the year will be support and wellbeing with his two chosen charities Genesis Orwell Mencap and Cancer Support Suffolk. Ipswich is my home town Having left Sri Lanka, Mr Elavalakan lived and worked in India, Uganda and Rwanda before moving to the UK. He initially moved to Ilford in east London, before moving to Ipswich in 2006. When I came for one project here, in Ipswich, I felt the people were very friendly, he said. So I decided, Ipswich is my home town. He became a Labour councillor for St Johns ward in 2014. Having lived in many different countries and experienced many different lifestyles, I have always been interested in helping those that need it, he said. I am passionate about empowering communities and representing those in need. Mr Elavalakan is not the first Ipswich mayor from the Indian sub-continent, however. Kavas Jamas Bashah was born in Mumbai and was a senior officer of the Indian Civil Service. He retired to Ipswich and became mayor in 1925. The town elected its first mayor, Benjamin Brame, in 1836 following the Municipal Corporations Act the previous year which reformed local government and made Ipswich a municipal borough. Its first female mayor was Mary Whitmore, in 1946. She was a suffragette and member of Womens Social and Political Union (WSPU), and was made MBE in 1951 for her contribution to public services. Albert Grant became Ipswichs first black councillor and mayor of Ipswich in 1995. He moved to the UK in 1955 at the age of 21 and has dedicated his life to tackling racism and fighting to secure equality and justice. He was awarded an OBE in 2000 for his services to ethnic minorities and in 2021 received an honorary degree from the University of Suffolk. Source: BBC News --Agencies",

        "content": "Forbes today announced the ninth edition of its 30 Under 30 Asia list, featuring 300 young entrepreneurs, leaders and trailblazers across the Asia-Pacific region, all under the age of 30, who are leading the transformation of industries and finding innovative ways to navigate new business realities in the region. The Forbes 30 Under 30 Asia Class of 2024 features 300 notable listees selected across 10 categories, including The Arts (Art  Style, Food  Drink); Entertainment  Sports; Finance  Venture Capital; Media, Marketing  Advertising; Retail  Ecommerce; Enterprise Technology; Industry, Manufacturing  Energy; Healthcare  Science; Social Impact and Consumer Technology. Among those featured on this years list is Dinara Punchihewa, a Sri Lankan-born actress and filmmaker. Over in Bollywood, Dinara Punchihewa burst on the competitive entertainment scene in 2018 by writing, acting and directing her own short film Maala, which was screened at international film festivals and caught the attention of Sri Lankan filmmaker Prasanna Vithanage, who cast her in Gaadi - Children of the Sun (2019). Since then, she has been in four other films. Punchihewa, a graduate of Queen Mary University of London, went on to found Punchi Actors, a nonprofit that introduces children from low-income families to theater and acting, the Forbes article states. After a decade together, the all-female, hijab-wearing Indonesian metal band Voice of Baceprot (VoB) last year released its first album, Retas, then quit its record label to go independent. The gutsy decision matches its reputation for challenging stereotypes in the Muslim-majority country. Band members Firda Marsya Kurnia, 23, Widi Rahmawati, 22, and Euis Siti Aisyah, 23 are some of the trailblazing artists and athletes who made this years Forbes 30 Under 30 Asia: Entertainment  Sports list. The trio were introduced to metal in their early teens by a teacher who taught them how to play instruments and helped set up their band. They have since gone from covering hits by groups such as Metallica for school events to creating their own music and touring internationally. In June they will attend Glastonbury, the first Indonesian musicians to perform at the U.K. festival in its 54-year history. With lyrics that address issues such as gender inequality and climate change, U.K.-based magazine Metal Hammer has called Voice of Baceprot the metal band the world needs right now. One of their singles, God, Allow Me (Please) to Make Music, has over 5 million views on YouTube. All three come from modest backgrounds in rural West Java (baceprot means noisy in their native Sundanese). They say their parents werent supportive at the start and their performances were sometimes sabotaged by haters. They also have experienced threats in a country where it is unusual for women to perform metal, but they dont plan to stop. We want to keep setting an example, especially for the young girls, that we have a brighter future, says Kurnia. Another girl band defying stereotypes and following a unique path is Japans Atarashii Gakko! The four-member group has intrigued audiences around the world with their cheeky sailor costumes, sassy dances and bold message of nonconformity. Since forming in 2015, the group joined label 88rising, hopped on the international music festival circuit  including Coachella in 2024  and started appearing on U.S. shows including Jimmy Kimmel Live! Their idiosyncratic performances arent mere weirdness: the groups philosophy is to challenge the norms set for Japanese youth and encourage individuality and freedom. Inspiring female athletes on this years Entertainment  Sports list are also reaching milestones and earning international recognition, empowering their fans on the way. Park Hye-jeong is lifting South Koreas stature in the sport of womens weightlifting. At the Asian Weightlifting Championships in Tashkent, Uzbekistans capital, in February, Park won gold in the womens 87kg, which is the heaviest womens weight class. In 2023, Park won gold at the International Weightlifting Federation World Weightlifting Championships in Saudi Arabias capital of Riyadh and the Asian Games in the southeastern Chinese city of Hangzhou. Park is the first Korean to win gold in the heaviest womens weight class at the Asian Games since weightlifting legend Jang Mi-ran in 2010. Last year, Yin Ruoning became the No. 1 player in womens golf, the second Chinese to clinch that crown after Feng Shanshan in the 2017-18 season. Yin achieved three consecutive top-three finishes in LPGA events in the U.S., the last of which was a third-place finish in Ohio in September. She also played for China last year at the 19th Asian Games in Hangzhou, where the country won bronze for a womens team event In 2022, Malaysian squash player Sivasangari Subramaniam was in a car accident that left her with facial fractures and a C1 vertebrae injury. Seven months later, Subramaniam won two gold medals at the 19th Asian Games in Hangzhou in 2023, and in April 2024, won the Professional Squash Association (PSA) GillenMarkets London Classic tournament in London. She beat three of the top five players in the world, claiming the win after an 81-minute final match. Currently ranked No. 13 in the world, Subramaniam has set her sights on the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles. --Forbes--",

        "title": "Forbes 30 Under 30 Asia list celebrates Sri Lankas Dinara",
        "date": "May 17, 2024 11:59 am",
        "content": "Forbes today announced the ninth edition of its 30 Under 30 Asia list, featuring 300 young entrepreneurs, leaders and trailblazers across the Asia-Pacific region, all under the age of 30, who are leading the transformation of industries and finding innovative ways to navigate new business realities in the region. The Forbes 30 Under 30 Asia Class of 2024 features 300 notable listees selected across 10 categories, including The Arts (Art  Style, Food  Drink); Entertainment  Sports; Finance  Venture Capital; Media, Marketing  Advertising; Retail  Ecommerce; Enterprise Technology; Industry, Manufacturing  Energy; Healthcare  Science; Social Impact and Consumer Technology. Among those featured on this years list is Dinara Punchihewa, a Sri Lankan-born actress and filmmaker. Over in Bollywood, Dinara Punchihewa burst on the competitive entertainment scene in 2018 by writing, acting and directing her own short film Maala, which was screened at international film festivals and caught the attention of Sri Lankan filmmaker Prasanna Vithanage, who cast her in Gaadi - Children of the Sun (2019). Since then, she has been in four other films. Punchihewa, a graduate of Queen Mary University of London, went on to found Punchi Actors, a nonprofit that introduces children from low-income families to theater and acting, the Forbes article states. After a decade together, the all-female, hijab-wearing Indonesian metal band Voice of Baceprot (VoB) last year released its first album, Retas, then quit its record label to go independent. The gutsy decision matches its reputation for challenging stereotypes in the Muslim-majority country. Band members Firda Marsya Kurnia, 23, Widi Rahmawati, 22, and Euis Siti Aisyah, 23 are some of the trailblazing artists and athletes who made this years Forbes 30 Under 30 Asia: Entertainment  Sports list. The trio were introduced to metal in their early teens by a teacher who taught them how to play instruments and helped set up their band. They have since gone from covering hits by groups such as Metallica for school events to creating their own music and touring internationally. In June they will attend Glastonbury, the first Indonesian musicians to perform at the U.K. festival in its 54-year history. With lyrics that address issues such as gender inequality and climate change, U.K.-based magazine Metal Hammer has called Voice of Baceprot the metal band the world needs right now. One of their singles, God, Allow Me (Please) to Make Music, has over 5 million views on YouTube. All three come from modest backgrounds in rural West Java (baceprot means noisy in their native Sundanese). They say their parents werent supportive at the start and their performances were sometimes sabotaged by haters. They also have experienced threats in a country where it is unusual for women to perform metal, but they dont plan to stop. We want to keep setting an example, especially for the young girls, that we have a brighter future, says Kurnia. Another girl band defying stereotypes and following a unique path is Japans Atarashii Gakko! The four-member group has intrigued audiences around the world with their cheeky sailor costumes, sassy dances and bold message of nonconformity. Since forming in 2015, the group joined label 88rising, hopped on the international music festival circuit  including Coachella in 2024  and started appearing on U.S. shows including Jimmy Kimmel Live! Their idiosyncratic performances arent mere weirdness: the groups philosophy is to challenge the norms set for Japanese youth and encourage individuality and freedom. Over in Bollywood, Dinara Punchihewa burst on the competitive entertainment scene in 2018 by writing, acting and directing her own short film Maala, which was screened at international film festivals and caught the attention of Sri Lankan filmmaker Prasanna Vithanage, who cast her in Gaadi - Children of the Sun (2019). Since then, she has been in four other films. Punchihewa, a graduate of Queen Mary University of London, went on to found Punchi Actors, a nonprofit that introduces children from low-income families to theater and acting. Inspiring female athletes on this years Entertainment  Sports list are also reaching milestones and earning international recognition, empowering their fans on the way. Park Hye-jeong is lifting South Koreas stature in the sport of womens weightlifting. At the Asian Weightlifting Championships in Tashkent, Uzbekistans capital, in February, Park won gold in the womens 87kg, which is the heaviest womens weight class. In 2023, Park won gold at the International Weightlifting Federation World Weightlifting Championships in Saudi Arabias capital of Riyadh and the Asian Games in the southeastern Chinese city of Hangzhou. Park is the first Korean to win gold in the heaviest womens weight class at the Asian Games since weightlifting legend Jang Mi-ran in 2010. Last year, Yin Ruoning became the No. 1 player in womens golf, the second Chinese to clinch that crown after Feng Shanshan in the 2017-18 season. Yin achieved three consecutive top-three finishes in LPGA events in the U.S., the last of which was a third-place finish in Ohio in September. She also played for China last year at the 19th Asian Games in Hangzhou, where the country won bronze for a womens team event In 2022, Malaysian squash player Sivasangari Subramaniam was in a car accident that left her with facial fractures and a C1 vertebrae injury.

        "date": "May 17, 2024 12:55 pm",
        "content": "The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has highlighted Sri Lankas commendable macroeconomic policies, rapid inflation decline, and steady economic growth. Addressing a press briefing held on Thursday (16) in the Washington DC, the Director of IMF Communications Julie Kozack said with respect to Sri Lankas economic performance, macroeconomic policies in Sri Lanka are starting to bear fruit. Commendable outcomes include a rapid decline in inflation, robust reserve accumulation and initial signs of economic growth while also preserving stability in the financial system. Overall programme performance has been strong. IMF staff and the Sri Lankan authorities have reached a staff-level agreement on economic policies to conclude the second review of the four-year EFF-supported program and the 2024 Article IV Consultation. Once the review is approved by IMF Management and completed by the IMF Executive Board, Sri Lanka will have access to about US337 million in financing, she added. Meanwhile, the IMF Communications Director further stated that the completion of the review by the executive board of the IMF requires two things  the implementation by the authority of the agreed prior actions and completion of the financing assurances review. She also stated that this would confirm multilateral partners, financing contributions and the financing review will also assess adequate progress with debt restructuring. Furthermore, Julie Kozack mentioned that the next step in respect to the debt restructuring is to conclude negotiations with external private creditors and to implement the agreements in principle with Sri Lankas official creditors. The domestic debt operations are largely completed. The initial debt restructuring negotiations with external bondholders ended in mid-April without an agreement and discussions are continuing with a view to reaching agreement in principles and on the official creditor side these agreements in principles are still needed to be finalised, she added.",

        "date": "May 17, 2024 01:40 pm",
        "content": "Sri Lankas Government must take meaningful action to determine and disclose the fates and whereabouts of tens of thousands of people who have been subjected to enforced disappearance over the decades and hold those responsible to account, a UN Human Rights Office report released today (May 17) says. It calls on the Government to acknowledge the involvement of state security forces and affiliated paramilitary groups, and to issue a public apology. This report is yet another reminder that all Sri Lankans who have been subjected to enforced disappearance must never be forgotten, said UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Türk. Their families and those who care about them have been waiting for so long. They are entitled to know the truth. The Government owes it to all those who have been forcibly disappeared. It is critical for these crimes to be investigated fully. These crimes haunt not only their loved ones, but entire communities and Sri Lankan society as a whole, the report added. Despite some positive formal steps by successive governments, such as the ratification of the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance, the establishment of the Office on Missing Persons and the Office for Reparations, tangible progress on the ground towards comprehensively resolving individual cases has remained limited, the report finds. Between the 1970s and 2009, widespread enforced disappearances were carried out primarily by Sri Lankan security forces and affiliated paramilitary groups. The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam also engaged in abductions which the UN Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances described as tantamount to enforced disappearances, it mentioned. Based on individual and group interviews, the report details the enduring psychological, social, and economic impact of enforced disappearances on the families of those forcibly disappeared, especially women. As most disappeared individuals have been male, women have often become the sole income-earner for a family, in a labour environment that poses many obstacles to womens participation, including risks of sexual harassment and exploitation. It adds that many women who have been at the forefront of efforts to find the disappeared have themselves been subjected to violations, including harassment, intimidation, surveillance, arbitrary detention, beatings and torture at the hands of army and police. They told me if I continue, they will cut my husband in pieces or that they will go after my children, said a woman who is still seeking a loved one. Under international law, it is a clear obligation for the State to resolve cases of enforced disappearances, which constitute continuing violations, until the fate and whereabouts of those disappeared are clarified, said the High Commissioner. Yet, most victim families remain without such clarification. Two weeks passed, then two months, then two years. Now it has been 32 years, and I am still waiting, said a man who testified before a national commission of inquiry about his disappeared son. Successive commissions of inquiry have been created by the Government. However, only a few of their reports have been made public and even when published, access has usually been limited. Most recommendations, particularly those relating to criminal accountability, have not been implemented. Alleged perpetrators, including current and former senior officials and diplomats, continue to evade justice. Despite the passage of nearly 15 years since the end of the armed conflict, and many decades since the earliest waves of enforced disappearances, Sri Lankan authorities are still failing to ensure accountability for these violations, it added.",

        "content": "Two voice actors sued artificial-intelligence startup Lovo in Manhattan federal court on Thursday, accusing the company of illegally copying their voices and using them without permission in its AI voiceover technology. Paul Skye Lehrman and Linnea Sage said in the proposed class-action lawsuit, opens new tab that San Francisco-based Lovo is selling AI versions of their voices without permission after tricking them into providing voice samples for the company. The actors, seeking damages of at least 5 million for the class, accused Lovo of fraud, false advertising and violating their publicity rights. The case is the latest in a growing wave of high-stakes lawsuits in which tech companies have been accused of misusing content including books, news articles and song lyrics to power generative AI systems. We want to make sure this doesnt happen to other people, lawyer Steve Cohen of Pollock Cohen, representing the plaintiffs, told Reuters. We dont know, of the thousands of voices Lovo says they use, how many people know that their voices were used and may still be used. Representatives for Lovo did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Lehrman and Sage were approached on freelancer marketplace Fiverr to provide voiceover work for anonymous clients, according to the lawsuit. Lehrman was told his voice would be used only for a research project, while Sage was told her voice would be used only with test scripts for radio ads, the lawsuit stated. Instead, Lehrman later heard AI versions of his voice in YouTube videos about Russian military equipment and in a podcast episode about the dangers of AI technologies, according to the lawsuit. Sages voice was used to give voiceovers for Lovo promotional materials, it added. Lehrman later learned that his Fiverr client was a Lovo employee, the lawsuit said. The actors said they later learned that Lovo was selling the use of Lehrmans voice to subscribers as Kyle Snow and Sages as Sally Coleman. According to the complaint, the company responded to a cease-and-desist letter by saying the actors voices were not popular and that their sales were negligible. The actors filed the lawsuit on behalf of a proposed class of people whose voices Lovo also is accused of misusing. The complaint said Lovos website also offers celebrity soundalike voices under names like Barack Yo Mama, Mark Zuckerpunch and Cocoon OBrien. The case is Lehrman v.

Twenty-one sailors, 20 from India and one from Sri Lanka, are stuck on board the Dali, a container vessel that collided with the Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore, since March 26 due to the ongoing investigation. Thats seven weeks. The 21 on board were left without communication for weeks with their families, causing significant hardship for crew members with young children at home, and the outside world, as their mobile phones had been confiscated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) as a part of the investigation into the crash. Tuesdays initial report by federal safety investigators raises several unanswered questions. For instance, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) outlined four power failures experienced by the 290-metre-long ship, reported ABC News. The causes of three of these failures remain unclear, including two that happened just before the crash. CREW STUCK ON BOARD DESPITE PROGRESS IN PROBE Despite explosives being used to remove part of the bridge from the ships hull on Monday, the crew still cannot leave the ship. The crew of 21, including 20 Indians, will remain on board until the probe into the incident is completed, reported ABC News. The US authorities have already begun interviewing the crew members on board the vessel, and have collected documents and voyage data recorder extracts as part of their investigation. The crew, consisting of 20 Indians and one Sri Lankan, couldnt leave the ship due to visa restrictions, reported the BBC. CREW MEMBERS FEAR PERSONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY The 21 crew members on the Dali are facing emotional distress, and they are also fearful of personal criminal liability. The sailors situations caught the attention of their two unions -- the Singapore Maritime Officers and the Singapore Organisation of Seamen. In a statement together on May 11, they mentioned that morale has understandably dipped, driven by unfounded fear of personal criminal liability and emotional distress. The unions also asked for the quick return of the sailors mobile phones so that they could connect with their family and make other arrangements at home, like paying their bills. Dave Heindel, president of the Seafarers International Union, stressed that regardless of how long the investigation lasts, the rights of crew members and their welfare should not be infringed upon. We call on the authorities to be mindful that seafarers utilise mobile devices to conduct personal business for bill payments, and, more important, transfer money to their home country to sustain families. Crew members are becoming demoralised without the basic tools we all take for granted, said Heindel, reported BBC. CREW MEMBERS ON BOARD GET PHONES, INDIAN SNACKS Andrew Middleton, from the Apostleship of Sea -- a programme that ministers to ships coming through Baltimore -- shared his experience visiting the sailors two weeks prior. Once we broke the ice and got everyone to say their name and what part of India they were from, and talk about if they were married or had children, we got the ball rolling. They were willing to kind of poke fun at one another a little bit.... we did our best to get them laughing and joking, hopefully to take their minds off things for even a few minutes, Middleton was quoted as saying by BBC. For now, the phones of 21 crew members on the ship, Dali, have been replaced with new ones, and Synergy Marine -- Dalis Singapore-based management company -- said that the crew members had unlimited use of satellite communication so that they could be in touch with the family, reported the ABC News. The crew members were also given care packages, including Indian snacks and handmade quilts. Darrel Wilson, a spokesperson for Synergy Marine, Dalis Singapore-based management company, said the crew is holding up well and that company representatives dispatched to Baltimore have been checking on them constantly, from day one, reported BBC. The Dali collided with the 2.6-km-long four-lane Francis Scott Key Bridge on March 26. The 984-foot cargo ship was bound for Colombo, Sri Lanka. Six construction workers who went missing after the Francis Scott Key Bridge in USs Baltimore city collapsed are presumed dead. The ship contained thousands of tonnes of steel and cement. After the hit, the cement and steel fell into the Patapsco River and left the ship stranded. The bridge was 8,636 feet (2,632 m) long and carried an estimated 11.5 million vehicles annually. The Francis Scott Key Bridge serves as a crucial transportation link in the Washington metropolitan area. The Francis Scott Key Bridge collapsed in Baltimore, which is 40 miles from Washington. The bridge was built at an approximate cost of 60.3 million. Source: India Today --Agencies",

        "content": "US officials have warned that foreign terror organisations may attempt to target LGBT events around the world during Pride Month in June. Authorities warned US citizens abroad to exercise increased caution. Stay alert in locations frequented by tourists, including Pride celebrations, a warning issued by the state department said. The advisory came on Friday, a week after a similar alert issued by US law enforcement agencies. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said: Foreign terrorist organizations or supporters may seek to exploit increased gatherings associated with the upcoming June 2024 Pride Month. Although no specific gatherings or locations were mentioned in the warnings, the law enforcement agencies noted that messages from the Islamic State (IS) group distributed in English in February 2023 included rhetoric against LGBTQI (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, questioning, and intersex) events and venues. During Pride Month in June 2016, a man inspired by IS ideology shot dead 49 people and wounded 53 more at Pulse, a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida. The FBI and DHS warning also noted that three IS sympathisers had been arrested for attempting to attack a Pride parade in Vienna, Austria in 2023. The Counter Extremism Project, a New York-based non-profit group, noted that anti-LGBTQ ideas had been taken up by both Islamist and far-right extremists. It is no surprise that neo-Nazis and jihadis often express mutual admiration for their shared anti-gay visions, Mark D Wallace, the projects chief executive, said in a statement. Protests and threats against LGBTQ communities by homegrown US groups also have been on the increase in recent years, according to a number of experts and research organisations. According to a report by the Anti-Defamation League and Glaad, a group formerly known as the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation, there were at least 145 incidents of anti-LGBTQ violence, harassment and vandalism during Pride Month in 2023.

        "content": "Adani Green Energys wind energy project, coming up in Sri Lankas northern Mannar and Pooneryn districts, has been challenged in the islands apex court on grounds of potential environmental impact and lack of transparency. The Wildlife and Nature Protection Society (WNPS), one of Sri Lankas oldest environmental organisations set up over a century ago, on May 16 filed a Fundamental Rights petition at the Supreme Court of Sri Lanka, with the aim of protecting the unique ecosystem of Mannar Island. The Societys petition argues that the project poses a severe threat to the islands unique biodiversity and pristine landscapes, especially in Mannar. Mannar is the southernmost point of the Central Asian Flyway used by innumerable migratory species, while also being home to several indigenous water bird and bat species, the WNPS said, contending that Sri Lankan authorities decision approving the project disregarded Mannars singular positioning as a biodiversity hub. The petition also notes that while the project has been portrayed as a Government-to-Government initiative with India, no details of contributions, grants, or loans from the Indian government have been disclosed. Further, the petition questioned the credibility of the Environmental Impact Assessment carried out by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Sri Lanka (SEASL) before the project was cleared, and the pricing formula finalised for the sale of power from the project. Sri Lanka recently agreed to purchase power at 0.0826, or 8.26 cents, per kWh from Adani Green Energy. While the companys renewable energy project in Sri Lanka has earlier faced criticism for the absence of due process and its likely environmental cost, this is the Adani Groups first legal challenge in the island. In February 2023, Sri Lankas Board of Investment approved the 442-million wind power project of Adani Green Energy. The Adani Group has also committed to investing close to 700 million to build a container terminal at the strategically located Colombo Port. Source: The Hindu --Agencies",

Mawlawi Abdul Hai Zaeem, the head of the information department for the central Ghor province, told Reuters that there was no information about how many people were injured in the rain spell that began on Friday, which had also cut off many key roads to the area. Zaeem added that 2,000 houses were completely destroyed, 4,000 partially damaged, and more than 2,000 shops were under water in the provinces capital, Feroz-Koh. Last week, flash floods caused by heavy rains devastated villages in northern Afghanistan, killing 315 people and injuring more than 1,600, authorities said on Sunday. On Wednesday, a helicopter used by the Afghan air force crashed due to technical issues during attempts to recover the bodies of people who had fallen into a river in Ghor province, killing one and injuring 12 people, the countrys defence ministry said. Afghanistan is prone to natural disasters and the United Nations considers it one of countries most vulnerable to climate change. It has battled a shortfall in aid after the Taliban took over as foreign forces withdrew from the country in 2021, since development aid that formed the backbone of government finances was slashed. The shortfall has worsened in subsequent years as foreign governments grapple with competing global crises and growing condemnation of the Talibans curbs on Afghan women. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "date": "May 19, 2024 11:28 am",
        "content": "Researchers from the Zoological Survey of India, in partnership with the Andhra Pradesh Biodiversity Board, rediscovered the Sri Lankan golden-backed frog (Hylarana gracilis) after two centuries in the Koundinya wildlife sanctuary in the Chittoor district, the southernmost point of the Eastern Ghats in Andhra Pradesh. With this finding, the number of freshwater frog species in India rises to 20. Bharath Bhupathi from the Zoological Survey of India, Hyderabad, encountered frogs of this species near a pond in the forest and suspected that it could be a new species. However, after consulting taxonomic experts and utilising morphological and DNA barcoding tools, the species was confirmed to be the Sri Lankan golden-backed frog Hylarana gracilis. Mr. Bhupathi emphasizes that rediscovery is more significant than the discovery of a new species, as it provides evidence for the historic land bridge between India and Sri Lanka. Amphibians are recognised as ecological indicators of healthy ecosystems, and the Eastern Ghats are home to 27 species of amphibians, considerably fewer than the Western Ghats. The study is the result of the collaborative efforts of multiple scientists, including Deepa Jaiswal, S.S. Jadhav, and Karuthapandi. M. from ZSI, Hyderabad, and K.P. Dinesh from ZSI, Pune, in collaboration with the researcher, Kalyani Kunte of Andhra Pradesh Biodiversity Board. District Forest Officer (Chittoor) C. Chaitanya Kumar Reddy said that the finding of the exotic species in the Palamaner range of Chittoor is a welcome sign for the region, and all steps would be taken to protect the species. In the present scenario, the Sri Lankan golden-backed frog populations in India and Sri Lanka are approximately 800 km apart. Additionally, there is a shallow genetic divergence of 0.2 to 1 genetic distance between these populations, supporting the evidence of changes in sea level in the late Pleistocene period or the Ice Age, resulting in land connections between India and Sri Lanka.

        "date": "May 19, 2024 02:48 pm",
        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe has directed the resumption of the Suraksha student insurance program, which was temporarily suspended due to economic challenges. Starting from the first week of June, all school students across the island will once again be able to benefit from this insurance scheme. The Cabinet recently approved a Joint Cabinet Memorandum presented by President Wickremesinghe, who also serves as the Minister of Finance, Economic Stabilization, and National Policy, alongside the Minister of Education Dr. Susil Premajayantha. Suraksha student insurance was originally implemented in 2017 by the then Prime Minister, based on a concept by President Wickremesinghe. The program aims to ensure continuous education for students affected by health issues and to increase school attendance by safeguarding student safety. It ran until December 1, 2022, but had to be temporarily halted due to economic constraints. With the current economic recovery, President Wickremesinghe has allocated Rs. 2000 million in the 2024 budget to revive the Suraksha student insurance program. The goal is to strengthen the program to develop the human resources necessary for a developed Sri Lanka by 2048. The insurance will cover health and accident insurance for approximately 4.5 million students aged 5 to 21 in government, government-approved private, and private schools (grades one to 13), as well as students aged 4 to 21 in special schools. Additionally, the program proposes life insurance benefits for students from low-income families, defined as those earning less than Rs. 180,000 annually, which includes coverage for the death of a parent. The anticipated benefits for all students under this program include: 1. Health Insurance: Inpatient Treatment Benefits: Up to Rs. 300,000 (in Government or Private Hospitals). For each night spent in a government hospital for a childs treatment, Rs. 2500 will be provided to the parents (regardless of admission to a government hospital, to assist with expenses incurred during the childs illness). Additionally, for each night spent in private accommodation, Rs. 7500 will be granted. Outpatient Treatment Benefit: Up to Rs. 20,000. This category covers payments for spectacles for pre-existing eye conditions, hearing aids for hearing loss, and laboratory test fees conducted by external hospitals during childrens illnesses. Critical Illness Benefit: Ranging from Rs. 200,000 to Rs. 1,500,000. 2. Accident Insurance: Total Permanent Disability: Rs. 200,000. Permanent Partial Disability: Ranging from Rs. 150,000 to Rs. 200,000. Temporary Disability: Ranging from Rs. 25,000 to Rs. 100,000. 3. Life Insurance: In the event of a parents death, students from low-income families will receive Rs. 75,000 per student for one parent. Benefits cover both parents. All school-going children in the family are eligible for benefits, with a maximum allocation of Rs. 225,000 per case (Rs. 75,000 each for a maximum of 3 children). For the implementation of this insurance program, the Ministry of Education will establish an agreement with the Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation. A special system will be established to expedite the provision of benefits to school students, with benefits being delivered through the Sri Lanka Insurance Corporations online platform within one week. The Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation will transfer entitled benefit funds to the respective bank accounts of the childrens parents. To ensure the programs success, government officials, including school principals and village officers, will establish a coordinated mechanism under the supervision of the State Revenue Unit of the Presidential Secretariat. This program is a joint effort between the Ministry of Education, the Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation, and the State Revenue Unit of the Presidential Secretariat. --PMD--",

However, the suspect had then started his car and driven forward, causing an accident involving the Ambassador. Later, police officers had arrived at the scene and arrested the suspect, who has been identified as a 33-year-old businessman residing at Ward Place in Colombo 07.

        "content": "Vietnam has nominated its Public Security Minister To Lam as its new president, state media said on Saturday, after his predecessor resigned in the ongoing anti-corruption campaign that has shaken up the countrys political establishment. The Communist Partys Central Committee had agreed to the nomination of To Lam, a Politburo member, as president, state-run Vietnam News Agency reported. The nomination will likely be approved by Vietnams rubber-stamp National Assembly during its next session on Monday. Former President Vo Van Thuong resigned in March after a little over a year in the position. His predecessor had also resigned in 2023 while taking political responsibility for corruption scandals during the pandemic. The anti-graft campaign is being led by Communist Party General Secretary Nguyen Phu Trong, 79, an ideologue who views graft as the gravest threat facing the party. The countrys most powerful politician has vowed that no one is untouchable in the so-called blazing furnace campaign. Lam, who has spent over four decades in the Ministry of Public Security before becoming the minister in 2016, has been a key figure in the execution of anti-corruption measures. The most recent high-profile resignation linked to the campaign was that of Vietnams Parliament head, Vuong Dinh Hue, in April. The current vice-speaker, Tran Thanh Man, has been appointed as Hues replacement. The president and the head of Vietnams Parliament are among the top four political positions in the party and the resignations point to instability that analysts say could threaten Vietnams ambitions as it vies to become an alternative to China in the regions supply chains. Analysts say that rivals in the party were jostling to position themselves as a successor to Trong, who was elected to an unprecedented third term as party chief in 2021. Given his age, experts say that it is unlikely that he will continue for another term. Source: The Associated Press --Agencies",

        "date": "May 19, 2024 07:24 pm",
        "content": "A helicopter carrying Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi suffered a hard landing on Sunday, Iranian state media reported, without immediately elaborating. Raisi was traveling in Irans East Azerbaijan province. State TV said the incident happened near Jolfa, a city on the border with with the nation of Azerbaijan, some 600 kilometers (375 miles) northwest of the Iranian capital, Tehran. Traveling with Raisi were Irans Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian, the governor of Irans East Azerbaijan province and other officials, the state-run IRNA news agency reported. One local government official used the word crash to describe the incident, but he acknowledged to an Iranian newspaper that he had yet to reach the site himself. Neither IRNA nor state TV offered any information on Raisis condition. Rescuers were attempting to reach the site, state TV said, but had been hampered by poor weather conditions. There had been heavy rain and fog reported with some wind. IRNA called the area a forest. Raisi had been in Azerbaijan early Sunday to inaugurate a dam with Azerbaijans President Ilham Aliyev. The dam is the third one that the two nations built on the Aras River. The visit came despite chilly relations between the two nations, including over a gun attack on Azerbaijans Embassy in Tehran in 2023, and Azerbaijans diplomatic relations with Israel, which Irans Shiite theocracy views as its main enemy in the region. Iran flies a variety of helicopters in the country, but international sanctions make it difficult to obtain parts for them. Its military air fleet also largely dates back to before the 1979 Islamic Revolution. Raisi, 63, is a hard-liner who formerly led the countrys judiciary. He is viewed as a protégé of Irans Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and some analysts have suggested he could replace the 85-year-old leader after his death or resignation from the role. Raisi won Irans 2021 presidential election, a vote that saw the lowest turnout in the Islamic Republics history. Raisi is sanctioned by the U.S. in part over his involvement in the mass execution of thousands of political prisoners in 1988 at the end of the bloody Iran-Iraq war. Under Raisi, Iran now enriches uranium at nearly weapons-grade levels and hampers international inspections. Iran has armed Russia in its war on Ukraine, as well as launched a massive drone-and-missile attack on Israel amid its war against Hamas in the Gaza Strip. It also has continued arming proxy groups in the Mideast, like Yemens Houthi rebels and Lebanons Hezbollah. Source: The Associated Press --Agencies",

        "date": "May 19, 2024 10:10 pm",
        "content": "A helicopter carrying Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi and his foreign minister crashed on Sunday as it was crossing mountain terrain in heavy fog, an Iranian official told Reuters, and rescuers were making their way to the site of the incident. The official said the lives of Raisi and Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian were at risk following the helicopter crash, which happened on the way back from a visit to Irans border with Azerbaijan. We are still hopeful but information coming from the crash site is very concerning, said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity. The bad weather was complicating rescue efforts, the state news agency IRNA reported. The chief of staff of Irans army ordered all the resources of the army and the elite Revolutionary Guard to be put to use in the search and rescue operations. State TV stopped all its regular programming to show prayers being held for Raisi across the country and, in a corner of the screen, live coverage of rescue teams deployed on foot in the mountainous area in heavy fog. The rescue teams were expected to reach the site of the crash later on Sunday evening, state TV reported. Raisi, 63, was elected president in 2021, and since taking office has ordered a tightening of morality laws, overseen a bloody crackdown on anti-government protests and pushed hard in nuclear talks with world powers. In Irans dual political system, split between the clerical establishment and the government, it is the supreme leader rather than the president who has the final say on all major policies. But many have seen Raisi as a strong contender to succeed his 85-year-old mentor, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has strongly endorsed Raisis main policies. Raisis victory in a closely managed election in 2021 brought all branches of power under the control of hardliners, after eight years when the presidency had been held by pragmatist Hassan Rouhani, who negotiated a nuclear deal with Washington. However, Raisis standing may have been dented by widespread protests against clerical rule and a failure to turn around Irans economy, hamstrung by Western sanctions. Raisi had been at the Azerbaijani border to inaugurate the Qiz-Qalaisi Dam, a joint project. Interior Minister Ahmed Vahidi told state TV only that one of the helicopters in a group of three had come down in the incident, and that authorities were awaiting further details.

        "date": "May 20, 2024 09:04 am",
        "content": "Image Credit: Red Crescent via FARS News Agency (Reuters) - Hopes are fading that Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi and his foreign minister have survived a helicopter crash in mountainous terrain and icy weather, an Iranian official said on Monday after search teams located the wreckage. President Raisis helicopter was completely burned in the crash ... unfortunately, all passengers are feared dead, the official told Reuters. Iranian state media outlets also reported that no survivors were found at the crash site of the downed helicopter. Rescue teams fought blizzards and difficult terrain through the night to reach the wreckage in East Azerbaijan province in the early hours of Monday. We can see the wreckage and the situation does not look good, the head of Irans Red Crescent, Pirhossein Kolivand, told state TV. Raisi, 63, was elected president in 2021, and since taking office has ordered a tightening of morality laws, overseen a bloody crackdown on anti-government protests and pushed hard in nuclear talks with world powers. A Turkish drone identified a source of heat suspected to be the helicopters wreckage and had shared the coordinates of the possible crash site with Iranian authorities, Anadolu news agency said earlier on X. State news agency IRNA said Raisi was flying in a U.S.-made Bell 212 helicopter. Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who holds ultimate power with a final say on foreign policy and Irans nuclear programme, sought to reassure Iranians, saying there would be no disruption to state affairs. The chief of staff of Irans army ordered all resources of the army and the elite Revolutionary Guards to be put to use in search and rescue operations. Earlier, the national broadcaster had stopped all regular programming to show prayers being held for Raisi across the country. In the early hours of Monday, it showed a rescue team, wearing bright jackets and head torches, huddled around a GPS device as they searched a pitch-black mountainside on foot in a blizzard. We are thoroughly searching every inch of the general area of the crash, state media quoted a regional army commander as saying. The area has very cold, rainy, and foggy weather conditions. The rain is gradually turning into snow. Several countries expressed concern and offered assistance in any rescue. The White House said U.S. President Joe Biden had been briefed on reports about the crash. China said it was deeply concerned. The European Union offered emergency satellite mapping technology. HARDLINER, POSSIBLE SUCCESSOR TO KHAMENEI The crash comes at a time of growing dissent within Iran over an array of political, social and economic crises. Irans clerical rulers face international pressure over Tehrans disputed nuclear programme and its deepening military ties with Russia during the war in Ukraine. Since Irans ally Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7, provoking Israels assault on Gaza, conflagrations involving Iran-aligned groups have erupted throughout the Middle East. In Irans dual political system, split between the clerical establishment and the government, it is Raisis 85-year-old mentor Khamenei, supreme leader since 1989, who holds decision-making power on all major policies. For years many have seen Raisi as a strong contender to succeed Khamenei, who has endorsed Raisis main policies. Raisis victory in a closely managed election in 2021 brought all branches of power under the control of hardliners, after eight years when the presidency had been held by pragmatist Hassan Rouhani and a nuclear deal negotiated with powers including Washington. However, Raisis standing may have been dented by widespread protests against clerical rule and a failure to turn around Irans economy, hamstrung by Western sanctions. Raisi had been at the Azerbaijani border on Sunday to inaugurate the Qiz-Qalasi Dam, a joint project.

        "content": "More than 650 employees at the Sapugaskanda Refinery, the countrys sole oil refinery, face potential job losses due to its transformation into a separate public enterprise. According to sources, the government plans to retain only approximately 200 of the current employees for the new enterprise. The remaining workers will be placed in a pool from which the new enterprise will select the necessary personnel to maintain operations. In March, the Cabinet of Ministers recently approved a proposal to operate the Sapugaskanda Oil Refinery as a state-owned business entity disjoined from the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC). The government had said it has identified the need to make a critical investment to upgrade the oil refinery in order to keep it up and running for another 25 years. Thereby, it has been decided that the Sapugaskanda Oil Refinery be operated as a separate public enterprise and to call Expressions of Interest (EOIs) to select a suitable strategic investment partner to upgrade the infrastructure facilities to address the existing operational challenges. The Power and Energy Minister had said the government is also exploring the option of relocating the Sapugaskanda Oil Refinery to Trincomalee in the future with upgraded modern facilities and the development of the Tank Farm. The facility, which is the only oil refinery in Sri Lanka, was established in 1969 and fulfils approximately 25 of the countrys demand for refined petroleum products.",

        "date": "May 20, 2024 11:26 am",
        "content": "(Reuters) - Here are some key facts about Mohammad Mokhber, 68, Irans first vice president who, based on the countrys constitution, is expected to become interim president following the death of Ebrahim Raisi in a helicopter crash.  As interim president, Mokhber is part of a three-person council, along with the speaker of parliament and the head of the judiciary, that will organise a new presidential election within 50 days of the presidents death.  Born on Sept. 1, 1955, Mokhber, like Raisi, is seen as close to Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, who has the last say in all matters of state. Mokhber became first vice president in 2021 when Raisi was elected president.  Mokhber was part of a team of Iranian officials who visited Moscow in October and agreed to supply surface-to-surface missiles and more drones to Russias military, sources told Reuters at the time. The team also included two senior officials from Irans Revolutionary Guards and an official from the Supreme National Security Council.  Mokhber had previously been head of Setad, an investment fund linked to the supreme leader.  In 2010, the European Union included Mokhber on a list of individuals and entities it was sanctioning for alleged involvement in nuclear or ballistic missile activities. Two years later, it removed him from the list.  In 2013, the U.S. Treasury Department added Setad and 37 companies it oversaw to a list of sanctioned entities.  Setad, whose full name is Setad Ejraiye Farmane Hazrate Emam, or the Headquarters for Executing the Order of the Imam, was set up under an order issued by the founder of the Islamic Republic, Khameneis predecessor, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. It ordered aides to sell and manage properties supposedly abandoned in the chaotic years after the 1979 Islamic Revolution and channel the bulk of the proceeds to charity.

        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe on Monday expressed condolences following the demise of Iranian President Dr. Seyyed Ebrahim Raisi and Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian. Sri Lanka is deeply shocked and saddened by the tragic death of President Ebrahim Raisi, Foreign Minister Amir-Abdollahian and other senior Iranian officials, said the Sri Lankan head of State, who is currently on a visit to Indonesia. I express my deepest sympathies and sincere condolences to the bereaved families, the government and the people of Iran. Our thoughts and prayers are with the families of President Raisi and his entourage, he said, in a post on X (formerly Twitter). Accompanied by Foreign Minister Amir-Abdollahian, Raisi had engaged in a short visit to the island nation just last month, the first by an Iranian president in 16 years. The two countries had signed five pacts during the visit, only the second since one in April 2008 by Irans then president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. Opening a 514-million Uma Oya hydro power project, Raisi had pledged to support development projects in the island by providing technical and engineering services. The Uma Oya project, in the central Badulla district, was constructed with Iranian technical assistance. It was started in 2010 by Irans FARAB engineering group and Iran initially provided 50 million. But in 2013, funding could not be continued because of international sanctions against Iran. The Sri Lankan government then decided to complete the project with its own funds using the same Iranian contractor. Raisi was killed in a helicopter crash in mountainous terrain near the Azerbaijan border, officials and state media confirmed on Monday. The helicopter was also carrying Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian and six other passengers and crew. World leaders offered their condolences on Monday following the tragic death.

        "content": "The Gujarat Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS) has arrested four ISIS terrorists, all of whom are Sri Lankan nationals, at Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel International Airport in Ahmedabad, Indian media reported today. The Gujarat ATS has taken the suspects to an undisclosed location for intensive questioning, reported TV9 Gujarati. The precise motive behind their presence at the Ahmedabad airport is not clear. Security has been heightened across the airport, the report said. The individuals, all Sri Lankan nationals, first arrived in Chennai before travelling to Ahmedabad, as per the media reports. They were waiting for instructions from their Pakistani handlers when they were apprehended. The arrest occurred before the suspects could receive any weapons, Indian media reports said. A press conference is scheduled for 4 PM where Gujarat DGP will provide further details regarding the arrests, it said. The arrests were made ahead of the arrival of three IPL teams at the Ahmedabad airport for the qualifier and eliminator games. In March, two top-rung leaders of ISIS in India were arrested near the international border after they crossed over from Bangladesh. The arrested ISIS cadres were identified as Harish Ajmal Farooqi alias Harish Ajmal Farukhi, a resident of Dehradun in Uttarakhand, and Anurag Singh alias Rehan, a resident of Panipat in Haryana. Both individuals were described as highly indoctrinated and motivated leaders of ISIS in India, involved in various activities including recruitment, terror funding, and planning terror acts using improvised explosive devices (IEDs). They had furthered the cause of ISIS in India through conspiracies to carry out recruitment, terror funding and terror acts by means of IEDs at several places across India, the police official said.

They are facing charges related to the import of substandard human immunoglobulin vials. This order was issued when the relevant case was taken up before the Maligakanda Magistrates Court today (20). The Criminal Investigation Department (CID) arrested Rambukwella on 02 February in connection with the procurement of substandard human intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), when he arrived there, complying with a court order. He had been grilled for nearly 10 hours before being arrested. The arrest came hot on the heels of pressure from civil society activists and health sector trade unionists, who called for the immediate apprehension of the lawmaker. Prior to the apprehension of Rambukwella, seven arrests had been made in connection with the drug procurement scam. But the fifth accused was later released on bail. As such, the former Health Secretary, the Director of the Health Ministrys Medical Supplies Division (MSD) and three other officials of the same division, as well as the owner of the company, which is said to have supplied the substandard batch of immunoglobulin vials, now remain in remand custody. Meanwhile, one of the suspects who was arrested and remanded in connection with the case was released on bail when the case was previously taken up on May 06.

        "title": "President Ranil criticizes Global Norths failure in climate change financing",
        "date": "May 20, 2024 07:33 pm",
        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe highlighted the stark contrast between global funding priorities, while pointing out the willingness of the Global North to fund death and destruction in Ukraine while showing reluctance to finance measures to combat climate change. Delivered a speech at the 10th World Water Forum, held in Bali, Indonesia today (20), he also proposed a 10 levy on the annual profits of global tax evasion assets deposited in tax havens, estimated at 1.4 trillion annually. He suggested that funds raised through this levy could support Blended Finance projects focused on climate change adaptation and mitigation. In his opening remarks, President Wickremesinghe extended his gratitude to the President of Indonesia Joko Widodo for hosting the event, which centres around the theme Water for Shared Prosperity. He praised Indonesia for its leadership in promoting the Sustainable Management of Lakes resolution at UNEA-5, emphasizing the collective responsibility in managing water resources, essential for all life and ecosystems. Following is the speech delivered by President Ranil Wickremesinghe: At the outset let me thank the President of the Republic of Indonesia, H.E. Joko Widodo for hosting the 10th World Water Forum in Bali. The theme Water for shared prosperity focuses on collective responsibility in managing water resources, the life blood of all living beings and ecosystem services. This follows the Sustainable Management of Lakes Resolution proposed by Indonesia at the UNEA-5. During the UNEA -6 held this year, the European Union together with Sri Lanka brought about the resolution 613 Effective and inclusive solutions for strengthening water policies to achieve sustainable development in the context of climate change, biodiversity loss and pollution. I also take this opportunity to congratulate the Government of Indonesia for taking the initiative during the G20 Presidency to launch the Global Blended Finance Alliance. Sri Lanka expresses its willingness to become a pioneering member. Climate Change and water stress are two sides of the same coin. The cumulative effects of Climate Change are the main reason for what we see today as the water resource crisis. According to IPCC projected climate scenarios till 2090, Sri Lankas dry zone will get drier and the wet zone will get wetter in an unprecedented manner. Sea level rise will cause salt water intrusion in coastal areas resulting in salinization of land. I took this example from Sri Lanka while appreciating the fact that this is what is happening all over the world. In global terms the solution to water stress revolves around climate mitigation and adaptation. Combating the triple planetary crisis with specific measures aiming at water. In the Nationally Determined Contributions water is classified under the adaptation sectors. On the other hand, mitigation is equally important as emissions are the root cause. Combating the threats to water resources posed by climate change requires colossal amounts of financial resources. The Global North has failed miserably in adhering to the commitments to provide financial resources for Climate Change. There is a notable lack of political will after the euphoria of the Glasgow COP was over. Climate Change denial is gaining ground in the West. The establishment of the Loss and Damage Fund, after a long drag, if effectively implemented can help to bridge the gap. This is a big IF. The Summit for a new Global Financing Pact will hopefully reach a conclusion by September this year. Nevertheless, the final outcome will depend on the results of the US Presidential Elections in November. The OECD in 2021 projected the investment for global water related infrastructure at US  6.7 trillion for 2030 and US 22 trillion for 2058. The UNEP Report 2023 Underfinanced  Underprepared estimate the under financed gap to combat climate change at US 194  366 billion per year. The Global North is willing to fund death and destruction in the Ukraine. But there is an unwillingness to fund measures to avoid death and destruction caused by climate change. Since money is not coming our way in anticipated amounts and at anticipated pace, to overcome the resource gap, Sri Lanka presented to COP 28 the Tropical Belt Initiative. A novel concept of harnessing commercial investments in the natural forests, mangroves, swamps, grassland water bodies and other natural resources in the Tropical Belt towards tackling the triple planetary crisis. The Tropical Belt from the time of its existence has been a shield for the whole world. It is a catalytic accelerator of solutions to the ongoing triple planetary crisis. Investment in the tropical belt will bring in transformative changes to combat the triple planetary crisis. In this context, the Initiative on Global Blended Finance will enable the Global South to mobilise the much needed financial resources. The US 9.4 billion available to commence this fund is a good example of leveraging concessional finance. The Tropical Belt Initiative will also benefit from this facility. In this context Sri Lanka proposes a 10 levy on the annual profits of global tax evasion assets deposited in tax havens. The annual profits are estimated at US 1.4 trillion per annum. The levy can be enforced by imposing sanctions, similar to those imposed on Russian Banks on the Banks and the Financial Institutes which fail to implement the levy. The monies raised by these levies to be made available to be utilised by the Blended Finance projects on Climate Change adaptation and mitigation. The Global Blended Finance initiative is a supplement to the Loss and damage funds  not an alternative. These two measures must work in tandem. Therefore at this forum, let us express our appreciation for the hard work done by Indonesia in proposing this Initiative at the G20 culminating the establishment of the Alliance Secretariat. Again, our thanks to President Joko Widodo for his contribution both in respect to the management of water resources and for bringing together the Global Blended Alliance. The World Water Summit, themed Water for Common Prosperity, began on May 18 in Bali, Indonesia, bringing together world leaders, experts, academics, entrepreneurs, and policymakers. The conference aims to unite nations in a collaborative effort to address global water issues. Since its inception in 1997, the World Water Summit has been held every three years, serving as a premier platform for countries worldwide to share experiences and knowledge on best practices for water management. The summit facilitates dialogues among stakeholders on water, sanitation challenges, and sustainable development goals. This years event sees the participation of key United Nations organizations, including the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific, the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, the United Nations Environment Programme, the United Nations Development Programme, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, the United Nations International Childrens Fund, the United Nations Industrial Development Organization, and the United Nations Climate Change Organization. Meanwhile, Indonesian President Joko Widodo hosted a dinner at the Bali Cultural Park yesterday (19) for the heads of state and representatives attending the conference. President Ranil Wickremesinghe was also in attendance. --PMD",

        "title": "ICC chief prosecutor seeks Netanyahu, Hamas leaders arrest",
        "date": "May 20, 2024 10:54 pm",
        "content": "(AP)  The chief prosecutor of the worlds top war crimes court said Monday he is seeking arrest warrants for leaders of Israel and Hamas, including Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, over actions taken during their seven-month war. While Netanyahu and his defense minister, Yoav Gallant, do not face imminent arrest, the announcement by the International Criminal Courts chief prosecutor was a symbolic blow that deepened Israels isolation over the war in Gaza. The courts prosecutor, Karim Khan, accused Netanyahu, Gallant, and three Hamas leaders  Yehia Sinwar, Mohammed Deif and Ismail Haniyeh  of war crimes and crimes against humanity in the Gaza Strip and Israel. Netanyahu and other Israeli leaders condemned the move as disgraceful and antisemitic. U.S. President Joe Biden also lambasted the prosecutor and supported Israels right to defend itself against Hamas. A panel of three judges will decide whether to issue the arrest warrants and allow a case to proceed. The judges typically take two months to make such decisions. Israel is not a member of the court, so even if the arrest warrants are issued, Netanyahu and Gallant do not face any immediate risk of prosecution. But the threat of arrest could make it difficult for the Israeli leaders to travel abroad. Netanyahu called the prosecutors accusations against him a disgrace and attack on the Israeli military and all of Israel. He vowed to press ahead with Israels war against Hamas militants. President Biden said the ICC prosecutors desire to arrest Netanyahu and Gallant was outrageous, adding whatever this prosecutor might imply, there is no equivalence  none  between Israel and Hamas. Hamas also denounced the ICC prosecutors request to arrest its leaders, saying it equates the victim with the executioner. Netanyahu has come under heavy pressure at home to end the war sooner than later. Thousands of Israelis have joined weekly demonstrations calling on the government to reach a deal to bring home Israeli hostages in Hamas captivity, fearing that time is running out. In recent days, the two other members of his war Cabinet, Gallant and Benny Gantz, have threatened to resign if Netanyahu does not spell out a clear postwar vision for Gaza. But on Monday, Netanyahu received wall-to-wall support as politicians across the spectrum condemned the ICC prosecutors move. They included Israels president, Isaac Herzog, and his two main political rivals, Gantz and opposition leader Yair Lapid. It is unclear what effect Khans move will have on Netanyahus public standing. The possibility of an arrest warrant against Netanyahu, whose popularity has dropped during the war, could give him a boost as Israelis rally behind the flag. But his opponents could also blame him for bringing a diplomatic catastrophe on the country. Yuval Shany, an expert on international law at Hebrew University and the Israel Democracy Institute, a Jerusalem think tank, said it was far more certain that Netanyahus already troubled international standing could be further weakened. This is going to make Netanyahu an outcast, and his ability to move around the world will be seriously compromised, said Shany. Even if the ICC does not issue the arrest warrant, other countries may now be more reluctant to provide support and assistance, he said. Hamas is already considered an international terrorist group by the West. Both Sinwar and Deif are believed to be hiding in Gaza. But Haniyeh, the supreme leader of the Islamic militant group, is based in Qatar and frequently travels across the region. Qatar, like Israel, is not a member of the ICC. The latest war between Israel and Hamas began on Oct. 7, when militants from Gaza crossed into Israel and killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took 250 others hostage. Since then, Israel has waged a brutal campaign to dismantle Hamas in Gaza. More than 35,000 Palestinians have been killed in the fighting, at least half of them women and children, according to the latest estimates by Gaza health officials. The war has triggered a humanitarian crisis in Gaza, displacing roughly 80 of the population and leaving hundreds of thousands of people on the brink of starvation, according to U.N. officials. Speaking of the Israeli actions, Khan said the effects of the use of starvation as a method of warfare, together with other attacks and collective punishment against the civilian population of Gaza are acute, visible and widely known.  They include malnutrition, dehydration, profound suffering and an increasing number of deaths among the Palestinian population, including babies, other children, and women. The United Nations and other aid agencies have repeatedly accused Israel of hindering aid deliveries throughout the war. Israel denies this, saying there are no restrictions on aid entering Gaza and accusing the U.N. of failing to distribute aid. Of the Hamas actions on Oct. 7, Khan, who visited the region in December, said that he saw for himself the devastating scenes of these attacks and the profound impact of the unconscionable crimes charged in the applications filed today. In their rampage, Hamas militants gunned down scores of revelers at a dance party and killed entire families as they huddled in their homes. These acts demand accountability, Khan said. Israel is also facing a South African case in the International Court of Justice, the U.N.s top court, accusing Israel of genocide. Israel denies those charges. The ICC was established in 2002 as the permanent court of last resort to prosecute individuals responsible for the worlds most heinous atrocities  war crimes, crimes against humanity, genocide and the crime of aggression. The U.N. General Assembly endorsed the ICC, but the court is independent. Dozens of countries dont accept the courts jurisdiction over war crimes, genocide and other crimes. They include Israel, the United States, Russia and China. The ICC becomes involved when nations are unable or unwilling to prosecute crimes on their territory. Israel argues it has a functioning court system. The ICC accepted The State of Palestine as a member in 2015, a year after the Palestinians accepted the courts jurisdiction. The courts chief prosecutor at the time announced in 2021 she was opening an investigation into possible crimes on Palestinian territory. Israel often levies accusations of bias at U.N. and international bodies, and Netanyahu condemned the decision as hypocritical and antisemitic. In 2020, then U.S. President Donald Trump authorized economic and travel sanctions on the ICC prosecutor and another senior prosecutor. The ICC staff were looking into U.S. and allies troops for possible war crimes in Afghanistan. U.S. President Joe Biden lifted the sanctions in 2021. Last year, the court issued a warrant for Russian President Vladimir Putin on charges of responsibility for the abductions of children from Ukraine. Russia responded by issuing its own arrest warrants for Khan and ICC judges. Source: The Associated Press --Agencies",

        "title": "Amnesty Internationals Secretary General concludes five-day visit to Sri Lanka",
        "date": "May 21, 2024 09:28 am",
        "content": "Amnesty Internationals Secretary General, Agnès Callamard, concluded a five-day visit to Sri Lanka on Monday, in which she met with officials and a diverse cross-section of society, stakeholders to discuss a range of pressing human rights issues. Speaking at the end of her mission, she said: This visit has provided insights into the many challenges that Sri Lanka is confronting 15 years after the end of the war that has fractured and polarized Sri Lankan society. I am deeply grateful to all those who engaged with us, recounting their pain and grief, sharing their views and concerns, and voicing their hopes, fears and demands for the present and the future. Amnesty International stands ready to support all genuine efforts and commitments to confront long-standing impunity, address the violations and grievances of the past and present, and put an end to discrimination and the repression of fundamental freedoms. We thank President Wickremesinghe for making the time and providing the opportunity to engage in a constructive dialogue over the human rights challenges facing Sri Lanka. As the home of our South Asia Regional Office, Sri Lanka is vital to our work and we appreciate the governments continued support and commitment to our cause. A slew of new legislations such as the Online Security Act and the proposed NGO law are worrying evidence of the dangers currently confronting Sri Lankass vibrant civil society. We are further concerned about the crackdown on freedom of expression and peaceful assembly, including through the use of ICCPR Act provisions, to make arbitrary arrests. These are often carried out under multiple accusations without formal charge or evidence and has led to lives being lived in limbo. This must end. This is a significant year for Sri Lanka, marking 15 years since the end of the three-decade long internal armed conflict that left tens of thousands of people injured, dead, displaced, or forcibly disappeared. But it is not just successive governments that have failed the victims and the people of Sri Lanka. All those in positions of leadership, from elected officials to opposition leaders, the religious establishment and the national media, have failed to hold the line on the fight against impunity. The elections slated in the coming months will also have a major impact on the future of Sri Lanka and human rights considerations for years to come. The political leadership of the country must implement trust building measures that will address divisions, encourage inter-ethnic solidarity, and provide avenues for meaningful healing. It is imperative to address past wrongs; and make a conscious effort to create an enabling environment for redress while the government considers the establishment of a new Truth and Reconciliation Commission. A seemingly lack of political will, along with complacency in delivering justice, prevents reconciliation, feeds grievances, and promotes instability. There should be no room for complacency. We urge the international community to work with the national authorities to secure truth and justice for all victims of the war and of on-going human rights violations and lay the foundations for a freer and fairer Sri Lanka. Following a meeting with President Ranil Wickremesinghe on Thursday (16 May), the Amnesty International delegation travelled to Mullaitivu on Friday to meet families whose loved ones were forcibly disappeared during the war. Agnès Callamard took part in the commemoration on 18 May at Mullivaikkal marking the 15th anniversary of the end of war and the suffering endured by the Tamils in the lead up to 18 May, before returning to Colombo to meet representatives of the Malaiyaha Tamil community, human rights defenders, protestors, members of civil society organizations, members of the international community and government representatives. The Amnesty International delegation focused on an array of key issues, including the lack of accountability for grave human rights violations committed by both sides during the internal armed conflict, repression of the right to peaceful assembly and discrimination against groups such as the Malaiyaha Tamil community, the Muslim community and LGBTI people. Other priority areas addressed throughout the visit included threats to civil society, freedom of expression and the right to peaceful protest, the use of anti-terror laws such as the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA) to suppress dissent, harassment, intimidation, surveillance and obstacles to press freedom, especially in the north of the country, the statement said.",
