        "content": "The Cabinet of Ministers has granted approval for the review of State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) with non-commercial interests. This proposal was presented by the President at the Cabinet meeting held yesterday (18). The government has been tasked with essential responsibilities such as providing public services, ensuring national security, maintaining law and order, regulating markets, ensuring equitable resource distribution, managing disasters, and overseeing social welfare. Currently, 86 departments, 25 District Secretariats, 339 Divisional Secretariats, 340 State-Owned Enterprises, and 115 non-commercial state statutory bodies are involved in carrying out these duties. The National Budget has allocated about Rs. 140 billion for the operation of 115 non-commercial state statutory bodies under the supervision of the Department of National Budget and 51 institutions under the supervision of the Department of Public Enterprises for the year 2024. Due to challenges such as outdated structures, insufficient or incompatible powers, and inefficiencies due to private sector involvement in similar functions, a review of these institutions has become necessary. Accordingly, the Cabinet of Ministers has approved the appointment of a committee to conduct this review and submit recommendations. The committee will be chaired by the Secretary to the Prime Minister and will include the following members: Secretary to the Prime Minister (Chairman) Secretary, Ministry of Education, Higher Education and Vocational Education. Secretary, Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock, Lands, and Irrigation Secretary, Ministry of Industries and Entrepreneurship Development Secretary, Ministry of Plantations and Community Infrastructure A Deputy Treasury Secretary nominated by the Secretary to the Treasury An Additional Secretary to the Ministry, nominated by the Secretary to the Ministry of Public Administration, Provincial Councils, and Local Government Director General of National Budget Director General, Department of Management Director General, Department of Public Enterprises Chairman, University Grants Commission",

        "date": "December 19, 2024 01:12 pm",
        "content": "The Cabinet of Ministers has granted approval for the import of high-quality genetic dairy cattle from Pakistan in an effort to increase local milk production. A budget of Rs. 100 million each was allocated in both 2023 and 2024 to acquire these high-quality dairy cattle with good genetics, but due to complications in the procurement process, the required cattle have not been obtained so far. In response, the government has reached out to several countries regarding the possibility of a direct government-to-government transaction for suitable cattle. The Trade Development Authority of Pakistan (TDAP), with the mediation of the Pakistan High Commission, has agreed to supply seven seminal male cattle of the Sahiwal and Nili-Ravi breeds to Sri Lanka. Additionally, the government has decided to purchase a total of 20,000 semen doses from Sahiwal cattle from the National Dairy Development Board of India as a government-to-government transaction. This will continue until the bulls are imported and the bull semen is produced. Accordingly, the Cabinet of Ministers has approved the proposal submitted by the Minister of Agriculture, Livestock, Lands and Irrigation to acquire five Sahiwal bulls and two Nili-Ravi buffaloes from Pakistan, as well as to purchase 20,000 doses of Sahiwal bull semen for the purpose of breeding via artificial insemination, from India through government transactions.",

Issuing a special statement today (19), he emphasized that it is necessary to move forward and protect the IMF agreement and that neither the government nor the opposition has the ability to exit that agreement. If we do so, economic problems will arise in this country again, he warned. The former President said that Sri Lanka is preparing to issue new international bond coupons before December 20 and that all related activities are now completed. All we have to do now is issue a declaration that we have come out of bankruptcy. After that, the banks will also take the necessary relief measures. Wickremesinghe said that at the same time, relief must be provided to the people. We have talked about this before. Every possible relief should be provided urgently. The former Head of State added that presently the income tax payment threshold has been increased from Rs. 100,000 to Rs. 150,000. That is the number we can do. I also discussed with the IMF to take it to the limit of Rs. 200,000. They did not agree to it, he said. We should act accordingly and provide more relief after the economy becomes stronger. Wickremesinghe said the government should remain in this program and that there is no way out of this. We must stick with it in good times as well as in bad times. I tell the opposition that there is no point in criticizing for no reason. I accept that the opposition is there to criticize. That is not a problem. Normally, an opposition is not going to praise a government. But I would like to remind you that such criticism should be made within the framework of the IMF agreement, he added.",

The Ministry of Defence through electronic and print media had previously announced that all firearms and ammunition issued to civilians for personal protection must be returned to the government by 21 November 2024 for a quantitative review. In response to the notice, about 85 of the licensees have returned their firearms, the ministry said issuing a statement today (19). Furthermore, the licensees were informed to submit appeals to the Ministry of Defence before October 30, 2024 explaining the requirement if they wish to retain their firearms. The licensees who have submitted appeals were informed to submit relevant documents along with their firearms to the Ministry of Defence for inspection and review. The Ministry of Defence said it decided to issue only one firearm per person for personal protection and it will be issued after considering intelligence reports. The review of all appeals for firearms and firearm inspections will be completed on January 20, 2025 and licensees are requested to submit their firearms for inspection before that date, the statement said. Furthermore, it has been observed that a significant amount of firearms and ammunition have been issued by the Sri Lanka Army and the Police in the past. Therefore, the Ministry of Defence has instructed that these firearms and ammunition be returned to the government before December 31, 2024. Accordingly, the licenses are informed to follow the directives and hand over these firearms and ammunition to the nearest police stations, the ministry said. It is also informed that legal action will be taken against licensees who fail to return their firearms for inspection before the stipulated date under the Firearm Ordinance No. 33 of 1916. In line with this decision taken by the Ministry of Defence to ensure a safe society by minimizing the use and misuse of firearms in the civil society and by implementing proper regulation, the licensees are informed to return all licensed firearms that have not been returned and submitted for inspection, before January 20, 2025.

        "title": "Putin says Russia is ready to compromise with Trump on Ukraine war",
        "date": "December 19, 2024 10:41 pm",
        "content": "Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Thursday that he was ready to compromise over Ukraine in possible talks with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump on ending the war and had no conditions for starting talks with the Ukrainian authorities. Trump, a self-styled master of brokering agreements and author of the 1987 book Trump: the Art of the Deal, has vowed to swiftly end the conflict, but has not yet given any details on how he might achieve that. Putin, fielding questions on state TV during his annual question and answer session with Russians, told a reporter for a U.S. news channel that he was ready to meet Trump, whom he said he had not spoken to for years. Asked what he might be able to offer Trump, Putin dismissed an assertion that Russia was in a weak position, saying that Russia had got much stronger since he ordered troops into Ukraine in 2022. We have always said that we are ready for negotiations and compromises, Putin said, after saying that Russian forces, advancing across the entire front, were moving towards achieving their primary goals in Ukraine. Soon, those Ukrainians who want to fight will run out, in my opinion, soon there will be no one left who wants to fight. We are ready, but the other side needs to be ready for both negotiations and compromises. Reuters reported last month that Putin was open to discussing a Ukraine ceasefire deal with Trump, but ruled out making any major territorial concessions and insisted Kyiv abandon its ambitions to join NATO. Putin said on Thursday that Russia had no conditions to start talks with Ukraine and was ready to negotiate with anyone, including President Volodymyr Zelenskiy. But he said any deal could only be signed with Ukraines legitimate authorities, which for now the Kremlin considered to be only the Ukrainian parliament. Zelenskiy, whose term was due to expire earlier this year but has been extended due to martial law, would need to be re-elected for Moscow to consider him a legitimate signatory to any deal to ensure it was legally watertight, said Putin. Putin dismissed the idea of agreeing a temporary truce with Kyiv, saying only a long-lasting peace deal with Ukraine would suffice. Any talks should take as their starting point a preliminary agreement reached between Russian and Ukrainian negotiators in the early weeks of the war at talks in Istanbul, which was never implemented, he added. Some Ukrainian politicians regard that draft deal as akin to a capitulation which would have neutered Ukraines military and political ambitions. Russias 2022 invasion of Ukraine has left tens of thousands of dead, displaced millions and triggered the biggest crisis in relations between Moscow and the West since the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis. Russia, which casts the conflict as a defensive special military operation designed to stop dangerous NATO expansion to the east, controls around a fifth of Ukraine and has taken several thousand square kilometres of territory this year. Determined to incorporate four Ukrainian regions into Russia, Moscows forces have taken village after village in the east and are now threatening strategically important cities such as Pokrovsk, a major road and rail hub. Putin said the fighting was complex, so it was difficult and pointless to guess what lies ahead... (but) we are moving, as you said, towards solving our primary tasks, which we outlined at the beginning of the special military operation. Discussing the continued presence of Ukrainian forces in Russias Kursk region, Putin said Kyivs troops would be forced out, but declined to say exactly when that would happen. The war has transformed the Russian economy and Putin said it was showing signs of overheating which was stoking worryingly high inflation. But he said growth was higher than many other economies such as Britain. Asked if hed do anything differently, he said he should have sent troops into Ukraine sooner than 2022 and that Russia should have been better prepared for the conflict. Asked by a BBC reporter if hed looked after Russia, something that Boris Yeltsin had asked him to do before handing over the presidency at the end of 1999, Putin said he had. We have moved back from the edge of the abyss, Putin said. I have done everything to ensure that Russia is an independent and sovereign power that is able to make decisions in its own interests. Russia, Putin said, had made proposals to Syrias new rulers about Russias military bases there and most people that Moscow had spoken to on the issue favoured them staying. Russia would need to think about whether the bases should remain or not, he added, but rumours about the death of Russian influence in the Middle East were exaggerated. Putin touted what he said was the invincibility of the Oreshnik hypersonic missile that Russia has already test-fired at a Ukrainian military factory, saying he was ready to organise another launch at Ukraine and see if Western air defence systems could shoot it down. In Brussels, Zelenskiy addressed Putins missile suggestion during a press conference at a European Council meeting, remarking of Putin: Do you think he is a sane person? Source: Reuters --Agencies",

The defendants were informed of this decision today in the Colombo High Court. Prison officials presented the five defendants in the case, including former Deputy Inspector General of Police (DIG) Vass Gunawardena and his son, Ravindu Gunawardena, before the court which announced the decision today. Colombo High Court Judge Aditya Patabendige informed the defendants that their appeals had been rejected, and the death sentence imposed by a three-member Colombo High Court bench had been upheld. The attorney representing the defendants raised concerns regarding the implementation date of the sentence, noting that the Supreme Court had not specified when the death sentence would be enforced. He pointed out that this detail was crucial if the defendants were hoping for a presidential pardon. In response, Judge Patabendige clarified that the matter of the sentences implementation date falls under the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court and that he cannot issue an order on this matter.",

        "date": "December 20, 2024 11:31 am",
        "content": "A total of 2.2bn (1.76bn) in cryptocurrencies has been stolen this year, with North Korean hackers accounting for more than half that figure, according to a new study. Research firm Chainalysis says hackers affiliated with the reclusive state stole 1.3bn of digital currencies - more than double last years haul. Some of the thefts appear to be linked to North Korean hackers posing as remote IT workers to infiltrate crypto and other technology firms, the report says. It comes as the price of bitcoin has more than doubled this year as incoming US president Donald Trump is expected to be more crypto-friendly than his predecessor, Joe Biden. Overall, the amount of cryptocurrency stolen by hackers in 2024 increased by 21 from last year but it was still below the levels recorded in 2021 and 2022, the report said. The rise in stolen crypto in 2024 underscores the need for the industry to address an increasingly complex and evolving threat landscape. It said the majority of crypto stolen this year was due to compromised private keys - which are used to control access to users assets on crypto platforms. Given that centralised exchanges manage substantial amounts of user funds, the impact of a private key compromise can be devastating, the study added. Some of the most significant incidents this year included the theft of the equivalent of 300m in bitcoin from Japanese cryptocurrency exchange, DMM Bitcoin, and the loss of nearly 235m from WazirX, an India-based crypto exchange. The US government has said the North Korean regime resorts to cryptocurrency theft and other forms of cybercrime to circumvent international sanctions and raise money. Last week, a federal court in St Louis indicted 14 North Koreans for allegedly being part of a long-running conspiracy aimed at extorting funds from US companies and funnelling money to Pyongyangs weapons programmes. The US State Department also announced that it would offer a reward of up to 5m for anyone who could provide more information about the alleged scheme. Source: BBC --Agencies",

The amendments reaffirm SLCs commitment to fostering good governance, transparency, inclusivity, and efficiency in its management structure, the SLC said in a statement. The new voting structure ensures that voting rights are determined solely based on the level of cricket played by each member club, with all qualified clubs and associations being entitled to only one vote. This marks a pivotal step towards equitable representation and streamlined decision-making. Further, in order to strengthen the transparency in financial management, the membership unanimously approved the establishment of the Audit Committee, Investment and Budget Committee, and Related Party Transactions Committee, the statement added. This landmark initiative is expected to create a more level playing field for cricketing stakeholders, ensuring that representation within SLC reflects merit and contribution to the development of cricket across the nation. SLC believes these constitutional amendments will foster a culture of professionalism, transparency, and meritocracy, paving the way for the holistic growth of cricket in Sri Lanka, it said. In addition to the above changes, the Election Committee for SLC for the year 2025, headed by retired Court of Appeal Judge Ms. Malanie Gunaratne and four other members, was also appointed during the Extraordinary General Meeting. The election committee will oversee the preparations and conduct the SLCs upcoming elections, scheduled to take place in 2025.",

He made this statement at a special press briefing held at the Department of Government Information this morning (20) to provide insights into President Anura Kumaras recent visit to India. However, the Foreign Minister stated the construction of oil pipelines between India, Sri Lanka, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) had been proposed. He stated that an agreement had been reached to continue these discussions further. Apart from that, he dismissed claims that an agreement had been reached to lay any Indian oil pipeline in Sri Lanka, calling such news false. India, Sri Lanka and UAE have decided to implement a multi-product pipeline for supplying affordable and reliable energy, according to the India  Sri Lanka joint statement released following a meeting between Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Sri Lankan President Anura Kumara Dissanayake in Hyderabad House in Delhi on Monday. According to the joint statement, PM Modi and Anura Kumara Dissanayake agreed to take steps towards the implementation of the solar power project in Sampur and further augment its capacity as per the needs of Sri Lanka. The joint statement reads, Emphasizing the need for reliable, affordable and timely energy resources for ensuring energy security and meeting basic needs of the people, both leaders underscored the importance of strengthening cooperation in the energy sector and facilitation towards timely implementation of ongoing energy cooperation projects between India and Sri Lanka. In this regard, the leaders agreed to: Take steps towards the implementation of the solar power project in Sampur and further augment its capacity as per the requirements of Sri Lanka. Continue consideration of the several proposals which are in different stages of discussion including: supply of LNG from India to Sri Lanka, establishment of a high-capacity power grid interconnection between India and Sri Lanka cooperation amongst India, Sri Lanka and UAE to implement a multi-product pipeline from India to Sri Lanka for supply of affordable and reliable energy, joint development of offshore wind power potential in Palk Straits, while prioritizing environmental protection including fauna and flora.",

        "date": "December 20, 2024 03:22 pm",
        "content": "Sri Lankas Foreign Affairs Minister Vijitha Herath says the allegations levelled against the former Deputy High Commissioner of Sri Lanka to Australia Himalee Arunatilaka, are completely false. Arunatilaka, who currently serves as Sri Lankas Permanent Representative to the UN in Geneva, was recently fined more than 100,000 in the Australian federal court, in addition to more than 500,000 in unpaid wages and interest to a Sri Lankan domestic worker for breaches of employment laws, while she was serving as the island nations Deputy High Commissioner in Australia. However, speaking at a special press conference held at the Department of Government Information this morning (20), the Foreign Minister claimed that Ambassador Arunatilaka had not committed any offence regarding the payment of salaries to the employee in question. Minister Herath also stated that Ambassador Himalee Arunatilaka is currently serving as Sri Lankas Permanent Representative to the United Nations in Geneva and continues to serve the country. In response to a journalists question regarding the matter, the Minister stated that Arunatilaka had not personally committed any fraud, and that the Sri Lankan government is responsible for paying the salaries of those in the service of its diplomats. Herath further explained that the Sri Lankan government is responsible for paying these salaries of employees based on Sri Lankas salary scales, which are lower than those in countries like Australia. Therefore, the Minister stated that the government regrets the inconvenience faced by Ambassador Himalee Arunatilaka, noting that the issue arose due to Sri Lankas lower salary scales. The salaries of employees who accompany an ambassador, high commissioner, or diplomat are paid by the Sri Lankan government. If we consider the salary scale of the Sri Lankan government, we pay the salary which goes along with the Sri Lankan economy. This amount is notably lower compared to the salary scales in countries like Europe and Australia. The problem arises with that. The salary she paid was the one provided by the Sri Lankan government. That is lower than the salary scales in Australia. As a result of that, the Australian government had taken legal action against her. Here I would like to say very clearly that Himali Arunathilake has not committed any wrong. But the court has taken legal decision according to the law of that country. We as a government have to make a policy decision about this. In contrast, the situation in African countries is different. That is the true story, the Minister added.",

        "content": "President Anura Kumara Dissanayake has highlighted the critical challenge of transforming Sri Lankas public service into an efficient state mechanism. He pointed out that the newly appointed committee tasked with reviewing state institutions would make decisions without being influenced by political pressures. The President shared these views while addressing the District Secretaries and Divisional Secretaries conference today (20) at the Ministry of Home Affairs Auditorium, located in the Nila Medura building in Narahenpita, the Presidents Media Division (PMD) reported. President Dissanayake noted that the public service, which has undergone multiple name changes from Government Agents to District Secretaries, boasts a history of nearly 200 years. He emphasized its pivotal role in steering the country towards a new direction. However, the President stated that the current situation is far from satisfactory regarding the ultimate goals and objectives. He noted that the public has no trust in receiving fair services from state institutions and emphasized that the entire system has collapsed as a functioning state mechanism, the PMD said. The President asserted that both political authorities and the public service must ask themselves whether they are prepared to restore the broken system. He clarified that his focus was not on the positions within public service but rather on who occupies those positions and their ability to lead effectively. He also highlighted the lack of dynamic leadership in certain sectors, a gap he aims to address by providing training for 1,500 officials in India, as agreed upon during his recent visit. Additionally, the government intends to grant scholarships for higher education abroad to a significant number of students who pass the Advanced Level examinations next year. President Dissanayake questioned the basis on which some institutions and positions were established and reiterated the challenge of transforming the public service into an efficient state mechanism. This, he noted, requires a new framework. He reaffirmed the commitment to reviewing state institutions through the newly established committee, which will make impartial decisions uninfluenced by political interference. While there is no intention to downsize the public service, the President acknowledged concerns about the high expenditure involved in maintaining it. He advocated for reforms to make the system more efficient and structured. President Dissanayake also stressed the importance of re-evaluating community-based projects and announced plans to expedite the Digital Identity Card initiative and launch the Clean Sri Lanka project starting January 01, 2025. He assured his full political support for these initiatives while emphasizing that their success depends on the contribution of public officials. Noting that 80 of the mandate rests on government employees, the President emphasized the need for harmony and mutual accountability between political authorities and government employees, it added. Accordingly, the President stated that previous mandates have demonstrated alignment between the expectations and goals of political authorities and the public service. He added that both sides are in agreement on the tasks at hand. The President also noted plans to implement several projects under three key areas: eradicating poverty, digital transformation, and reshaping societal attitudes through the Clean Sri Lanka project. These efforts aim to elevate the country to a new level. President Anura Kumara Dissanayake emphasized that he would stand in defense of any official who faces challenges, injustice, or unfair treatment while working towards these goals. However, he warned that any deliberate efforts by an official to obstruct or neglect these tasks would be met with equally firm action. The event was attended by Prime Minister Dr. Harini Amarasuriya; Minister of Public Administration, Provincial Councils, and Local Government Dr. A.H.M.H. Abeyrathne, Deputy Minister P. Ruwan Senarath, Secretary to the President Dr. Nandika Sanath Kumanayake, Secretary to the Prime Minister G.

        "content": "Sri Lanka will soon formulate a national policy on allowing visits by foreign research vessels, Foreign Minister Vijitha Herath said here on Friday, amidst frequent docking requests from Chinese surveillance ships which raised concerns in India. Heraths comments came days after Sri Lankan President Anura Kumara Dissanayakes visit to India. In January, Sri Lanka enforced a year-long moratorium on foreign marine scientific research survey vessels operating in its waters and the Exclusive Economic Zone after strong security concerns were raised by India and the US following frequent docking requests from hi-tech Chinese surveillance vessels. Sri Lankas moratorium on allowing research vessels is still in force which would be reviewed appropriately, Herath said. Upon his return to Colombo from India, Dissanayake held a meeting with a top Chinese government official who expressed Chinas wish to see Chinese research ships resuming their visits to Colombo. Asked if India had raised concerns over such visits during Dissanayakes stay in India, Herath said Indian concerns were based on their national security and regional security threats. We assured that we will not allow any action to threaten Indian security concerns by using our land, Herath said. The visit has turned out to be one which has resulted in many achievements for the people of Sri Lanka, Herath said. It took the relationship to a new height, he said. Herath said that India and Sri Lanka did not seal any formal agreements during Dissanayakes visit other than signing two MoUs on training Sri Lankan public service officials and preventing dual taxation. We have only agreed to take forward the talks related to the Economic and Technology Cooperation Agreement (ETCA). There was no final agreement on anything, Herath said. When Dissanayakes National Peoples Power was not in power it had expressed bitter opposition to the agreement. Herath also rejected allegations that Dissanayake finalized an agreement in Delhi for a direct fuel pipeline and a security pact across the Palk Strait. We were emphatic that we are for promoting trade and investment between the two countries, Herath said. Source: PTI --Agencies",

        "content": "Fitch Ratings has upgraded Sri Lankas Long-Term Foreign-Currency Issuer Default Rating (IDR) to CCC from RD (Restricted Default), citing the completion of the international sovereign bond restructuring and an improved outlook for macroeconomic indicators. Fitch typically does not assign an Outlook to sovereigns with a rating of CCC or below. Fitch has also upgraded the Local-Currency IDR to CCC, from CCC-, to align with the Long-Term Foreign-Currency IDR, as the risk of another default on local-currency debt has been reduced by the completion of the international sovereign bond restructuring and an improved outlook for macroeconomic indicators. Sri Lanka completed the local-currency portion of its domestic debt optimisation in September 2023, following the exchange of treasury bills and provisional advances held by Central Bank of Sri Lankas into new treasury bonds and bills. The upgrade of the Long-Term Foreign-Currency IDR reflects Fitchs assessment that Sri Lanka has normalised relations with a majority of creditors, after the announcement of final results of the invitation to exchange the outstanding stock of international sovereign bonds with a 98 participation rate. One bond series with non-aggregated collective action clauses did not meet the required 75 level. Without this bond series, the acceptance results imply a restructuring of 96 of total commercial external debt, it said. The debt exchange will convert 11 international sovereign bonds and accumulated past due interest (PDI) into a mix of four macro-linked bonds, one governance-linked bond and one PDI bond. Bondholders can choose the local alternative governed by domestic law, with rupee-denominated bonds and a US dollar bond with step-up coupon payments.",

        "title": "Two dead, dozens injured in car attack on German Christmas market",
        "date": "December 21, 2024 08:43 am",
        "content": "Two people have been killed, including a child, and dozens injured after a car drove into a crowd at a Christmas market in the eastern German city of Magdeburg, officials say. In a statement, authorities said 68 people had been injured, 15 of whom seriously. Reiner Haseloff, the premier of the state of Saxony-Anhalt, told reporters at the scene that the suspect - who has been arrested - was a 50-year-old Saudi citizen who arrived in Germany in 2006 and had worked as a doctor. He said a preliminary investigation suggested the alleged attack was acting as a lone wolf and that he could not rule out further deaths due to the number of injured. The suspected attackers motive is unclear, and he has no known links to Islamist extremism. Footage from the scene shows numerous emergency services vehicles attending while people lay on the ground. Unverified video on social media purports to show a car ploughing into the crowd at the market. A spokesperson for the city of Magdeburg said all hospitals in the area were preparing for a mass casualty event, according to the Reuters news agency. City officials said around 100 firefighters and 50 rescue service personnel are at the scene. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said reports from Magdeburg lead us to fear the worst. He added: My thoughts are with the victims and their loved ones. We stand by their side and by the side of all Magdeburg residents. My thanks to all the emergency services in these difficult hours. Scholz will visit the city on Saturday, Haseloff said. Around 19:20 local time (18:20 GMT), the organisers of the Christmas market announced that it had been closed as asked for understanding. A short while later, they called for members of the public to avoid the market. Please let the emergency services do their job and leave the market in an orderly manner, they wrote on social media. In an interview with German paper Bild, Nadine, described being at the Christmas market with her boyfriend, Marco, when the car came speeding towards them. He was hit and pulled away from my side, the 32-year-old told the paper. It was terrible. Meanwhile, Lars Frohmüller, a reporter for German public broadcaster MDR, told BBC Radio 4s World Tonight he saw blood on the floor as well as many doctors trying to keep people warm and help them with their injuries. When the incident occurred, Magdeburgs football team were playing against Fortuna Dusseldorf. After the game finished, the teams players united in a line in front of their supporters. A statement from the club said its thoughts are with those affected by the terrible events and the Magdeburg Christmas market. Meanwhile, a minutes silence was held at the end of a match between Bayern and RB Leipzig in Munich. Fridays incident is not the first time people at a Christmas market have been attacked in Germany. In 2016, Anis Amri, a Tunisian man who failed to gain asylum in Germany and had links to the so-called Islamic State (IS) group, drove a truck into crowds gathered at a church market in Berlin, killing 12 and injuring 49 others. Two years later, a gunman opened fire on a Christmas market in the eastern French city of Strasbourg, killing five and injuring another 11 people. The gunman was shot dead by police two days later. French President Emmanuel Macron said his country shares the pain of the German people and expresses its full solidarity following the incident in Magdeburg. Source: BBC --Agencies",

        "date": "December 21, 2024 09:56 am",
        "content": "Sri Lankan Ambassador in Riyadh Omar Lebbe Ameer Ajwad expressed his desire to elevate bilateral relations to new heights as Saudi Arabia and Sri Lanka celebrate 50 years of diplomatic ties. In an exclusive interview with Arab News, Ajwad said: Saudi Arabia and Sri Lanka are celebrating the 50th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations. He added: Sri Lanka and Saudi Arabia have a very long background of ties. According to the history books, it started in the seventh century  when Sri Lankan King Aggrabodhi III dispatched a delegation on a fact-finding mission to Saudi Arabia, on the request of the Arab people who were living in Sri Lanka at that time. The king sent an envoy to Madinah to learn about Islam from Prophet Muhammad. This ancient trade and people-to-people relationship between Saudi Arabia and Sri Lanka flourished over time. The two established formal diplomatic relations in 1974. The first Saudi ambassador to Sri Lanka was appointed in August 1977. The Sri Lanka mission was established in Jeddah in 1983. The Embassy of Sri Lanka was established in Jeddah with M.R.M Thassim as the first accredited ambassador, and shifted to Riyadh in 1985. We are celebrating this historic moment. Its a milestone in our bilateral relations. We have decided on a logo to be unveiled soon to mark this occasion, both countries have agreed on that. We will soon launch it both in Saudi Arabia as well as Colombo. The logo will demonstrate the close bilateral relations, said the ambassador. We will issue a postal stamp to mark the occasion. Both countries are now working on that to release a stamp to demonstrate the depth of relations, Ajwad told Arab News. We also took some initiatives to mark the golden jubilee occasion such as the green initiative with the tree planting campaign in Riyadh in collaboration with the Saudi Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Riyadh municipality  we have already planted trees in four parks with our community. It is aligned with the Saudi Green Initiative that aims to plant 10 billion trees, he said. (We) also initiated planting campaign in the Sri Lankan Schools in Riyadh and Jeddah to mark the 50th anniversary, he added. We initiated an Ambassadors Cup cricket tournament among our community to mark this occasion. We already had it in Jeddah, and now we have a final on Dec. 27 in Riyadh, he said. We have also launched events to boost cultural cooperation between the two countries. Ajwad noted that Saudi Arabia under the visionary leadership of King Salman and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has embarked on an ambitious Vision 2030 program. We witness Saudi Arabias fastest developments in all spheres, he said, adding that Sri Lanka was one of the first countries which pledged support for Saudi Arabia hosting Expo 2030. He also said Sri Lanka is proud of the Kingdom winning the bid to host the FIFA World Cup in 2034. I believe the commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the diplomatic relations will serve as a catalyst to further consolidate our bilateral relations in all areas of mutual interest in the years ahead, said Ajwad. Following the commemorative year, we are planning to initiate the first political consultation meeting between the foreign ministries of both countries, finalizing the roadmap for economic cooperation between the Ministry of Economy and Planning of Saudi Arabia and the relevant ministry in Sri Lanka, and activating the MoU on foreign investment signed this year between Sri Lanka and the Ministry of Investment of Saudi Arabia, he added. On diplomatic ties with Saudi Arabia, the ambassador said: We are very closely working on all aspects. He added that the Saudi-Sri Lanka Joint Committee was established under the General Cooperation Agreement signed between the two countries in 2003. The committee held its first session in 2023 in Riyadh. The Saudi delegation was led by Dr. Abdullah Nasser Abu Thnain, deputy minister of human resources and social development, while the Sri Lankan delegation was headed by Tharaka Balasuriya, former minister of state for foreign affairs. We have identified around 63 items for economic cooperation under the Joint Committee. We have also set up an economic roadmap under the framework of the Joint Committee, said the ambassador. Its a very promising roadmap. So we will build on the relations that we have already maintained, to elevate it to the new heights, said Ajwad. Saudi Arabias assistance to Sri Lanka is broad and diverse. The Kingdom has provided assistance to the tune of 455 million to implement over 15 development projects in education, irrigation, agriculture and road networks, including the establishment of Medical Faculty at the University of Sabaragamuwa, the development of the Wayamba University township and the Kurinchakerni Bridge project. The Saudi aid agency KSrelief has also implemented 18 projects including shelter, food security, and humanitarian operations at a cost of more than 15 million. Formation of a Parliamentary Friendship Committee between the two countries has further strengthened bilateral ties, said the envoy. We are also focused on the private sector interactions between the two countries, he added. Tourism is a very promising area for Sri Lanka. We saw an increased number of Saudi tourists visiting Sri Lanka. Saudis are placed third in number of tourists visitng Sri Lanka, said Ajwad, adding: We are working closely on promoting tourism. Its a promising area. We can work in the hospitality sector as well. There is a big interest. Source: Arab News --Agencies",

Speaking to the media before leaving the island, Sri Lanka captain Charith Asalanka addressed the decision to omit young spinner Dunith Wellalage from the squad, citing the need for an additional fast bowler to adapt to New Zealands pitch conditions. Explaining the rationale behind the selection, Asalanka said, Dunith was dropped because we wanted to include an extra fast bowler for the conditions in New Zealand. It was a very tough decision for me, the selection committee, and the coach. Sometimes, such calls have to be made when playing on pitches like those in New Zealand. Asalanka also commented on the teams preparation and morale ahead of the challenging tour. The players are in good spirits. Their performances in the recent T10 series were commendable, with players contributing through runs and wickets. This has been good preparation for the team, he said. New Zealand is a strong team, especially at home. They havent made many major changes to their squad, which will be an added challenge. However, we are confident that our experienced players will help guide the newcomers and strengthen the team, he added.

        "content": "Twenty-five civilians were sentenced by a Pakistani military court to periods of two to 10 years of rigorous imprisonment in connection with attacks on military facilities in 2023, the armed forces media wing said on Saturday. The ruling underscores concerns among supporters of jailed former prime minister Imran Khan that military courts are going to play a bigger role in cases involving the 72-year-old, who is facing multiple charges including allegedly inciting attacks against the armed forces. Thousands of Khan supporters stormed military installations and torched a generals house on May 9, 2023 to protest against the former premiers arrest by paramilitary soldiers. At least eight people were killed in the violence. The militarys Inter-Services Public Relations office said the sentences handed down on Saturday were an important milestone in dispensation of justice to the nation. It is also a stark reminder to all those who are exploited by the vested interests and fall prey to their political propaganda and intoxicating lies, to never take law in own hands, it added in a statement. Others charged over the violence were being tried in anti-terrorism courts but justice would only be fully served once the mastermind and planners ... are punished as per the Constitution and laws of the land, the military said. The ruling comes days after Khan was indicted by an anti-terrorism court on charges of inciting attacks against the military. An army general who served under him as his spy chief, Faiz Hamid, is facing a military investigation on the same charges. Pakistans Supreme Court last week allowed military courts to announce verdicts in concluded trials of nearly 85 supporters of Khan on charges of attacking army installations, however it made such verdicts conditional on the outcome of appeals against the jurisdiction of military courts over civilians. The court last year provisionally allowed military courts to try civilians. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

In response, the CID launched a probe to identify the cause of the error and determine accountability. As part of the investigation, statements were recorded from parliamentary officials involved in the incident. This controversy began when the Parliament website mistakenly listed the Ministers name as Dr. Harshana Nanayakkara, and later corrected it by removing the Dr. title following a complaint made by the Minister.

        "date": "December 21, 2024 05:31 pm",
        "content": "The Secretary to the Treasury Mainda Siriwardena says that 20 December 2024 marked a major milestone in Sri Lankas economic recovery process as the country officially exited sovereign default. Posting on X (formerly Twitter) after Fitch Ratings upgraded Sri Lanka to CCC, the Treasury Secretary noted that this has been a long and difficult journey, comprising painful reforms and a very complex debt restructuring. Whilst this rating upgrade is a crucial milestone, I firmly believe this is just the start of Sri Lankas journey towards prosperity for all, where everyone should make their utmost contribution, he added. Furthermore, Siriwardena stated that there is no room to repeat policy errors by relying on dogmatic beliefs, ideological leanings, and being led by false narratives which typically lead to unrealistic and unsustainable policies. It is the key lesson that all of us Sri Lankans should learn from this painful, stressful and very tough process that we were forced to undergo during last 32 months. The collapse happens rapidly, but the recovery is painful and difficult. I hope these lessons are engrained in our society now and in the future as we reflect on this journey. This is indeed a historic moment and a time to celebrate - but it is a moment that should never be repeated, the Treasury Secretary expressed. Moreover, he emphasized that with the stability in the economy, measures are now needed to provide further momentum for inclusive and sustainable growth, adding that this is necessary to create jobs, and generate income that will help rebuild the lives of all Sri Lankans. However, this growth cannot come at the expense of economic stability. All too often in Sri Lankas past, whenever the economy has stabilised following a shock, we are too eager to provide unsustainable fiscal and monetary stimulus to re-invigorate growth. The result is a rapid return to instability - which has characterised several stop-go cycles in Sri Lankas post-independence economic history. In the past, Sri Lankas economic policy has been volatile, vacillating from one extreme to the other based on political shifts, Siriwardena highlighted. Furthermore, Mahinda Siriwardena said that it is crucial that regardless of political changes, Sri Lanka adheres to some fundamental economic principles, such as fiscal discipline and sound monetary management. In particular, the stabilization of public finances is vital to create fiscal space for development, and fulfil commitments to both domestic and international stakeholders. It is indeed heartening that we are now seeing early signs of de-politicization of macroeconomic policy discipline. This would be entrenched by a strong legal and institutional framework, including the Central Bank of Sri Lanka Act, Public Financial Management Act, Public Debt Management Act, and associated institutions, Siriwardena added. The Treasury Secretary also added: All the hard work and sacrifice, particularly by the people of Sri Lanka, has now paid off and Sri Lanka has the opportunity for a fresh start in the new year. This achievement is a testament to the tireless efforts of colleagues at the Ministry of Finance, Central Bank, Sri Lankas political leadership since April 2022, and our advisors Lazard and Clifford Chance who provided amazing support to enable this positive outcome. The support of international financial institutions, particularly the International Monetary Fund, other domestic and international agencies, foreign governments, and all the creditors are owed gratitude for their tremendous support, he said. Meanwhile, his comment highlighted that this rating upgrade reflects two key points that all Sri Lankans should consider seriously; First, it was easy to make the policy mistakes that brought the country to an unprecedented, deep and complex crisis that we experienced since 2022. To this day, I maintain that Sri Lankas economic crisis was a man-made crisis, since the crisis could have been prevented or at least the impact could have been mitigated, if the warning signs had been heeded and policy direction was changed in a timely manner, including an early engagement with the IMF. The consequences were deadly, as the economic crisis shattered the expectations of 22 million of people while having a negative impact on the generations to come. Second; while macroeconomic outcomes have indeed been satisfactory and the debt restructuring process is completed, culminating in this rating upgrade, people still feel the pain from the crisis and the difficult remedial measures. Fitch Ratings has upgraded Sri Lankas Long-Term Foreign-Currency Issuer Default Rating (IDR) to CCC from RD (Restricted Default), citing the completion of the international sovereign bond restructuring and an improved outlook for macroeconomic indicators. Fitch typically does not assign an Outlook to sovereigns with a rating of CCC or below. Fitch has also upgraded the Local-Currency IDR to CCC, from CCC-, to align with the Long-Term Foreign-Currency IDR, as the risk of another default on local-currency debt has been reduced by the completion of the international sovereign bond restructuring and an improved outlook for macroeconomic indicators. Sri Lanka completed the local-currency portion of its domestic debt optimisation in September 2023, following the exchange of treasury bills and provisional advances held by Central Bank of Sri Lankas into new treasury bonds and bills.",

The telecoms company, known for its pay-as-you-go SIM cards that piggyback off EEs mobile network, has announced it faces pretty serious challenges both financially and operationally, a report from The Guardian has revealed. At a recent meeting at the companys London headquarters, workers were warned that 316 roles could be at risk, leaving just 48 members of staff remaining in the UK. Lycamobile could lay off 90 The companys general counsel, David Dobbie, said that increased competition, rising costs and legacy technology issues were to blame for the threat of job cuts. Dobbie also noted internal inefficiencies caused by overlapping between its UK and India operations. Lycamobiles French business was fined 10 million (8.3 million) in 2023 after a Paris court concluded that it had been laundering money and conducting VAT fraud. In the UK, the company is also in trouble with the HRMC over an alleged 51 million unpaid VAT bill. As a result of the job cuts, some roles like customer service would be moved to other countries, including India. Dobbie promised that a consultation would start immediately, with affected workers set to be laid off no earlier than January 31, 2025. A company spokesperson added: As with all other UK companies, Lycamobile reviews its business model on an ongoing basis to provide the best possible service to its customers. No final decisions have been made on any changes to our model at this time, but we have announced a consultation process regarding strategic changes to align with our long-term growth goals and the challenges facing our business and other telcos, including a focus on digital transformation.

The officials have issued strict warnings to the owners of the offending establishments. They were ordered to remove broken plastic utensils deemed unsuitable for food preparation and to take immediate steps to improve sanitation standards. The inspections led to heated exchanges between restaurant owners and health officials. Despite the pushback, the officials emphasized their commitment to upholding public health standards. Legal action has been initiated against all restaurants found to be operating in unhygienic conditions.",

        "date": "December 21, 2024 09:32 pm",
        "content": "Sri Lankan President Anura Kumara Dissanayake will travel to the islands largest bilateral lender China for talks in January, he said on Saturday, days after completing a long-delayed foreign debt restructure. China accounted for more than half of Sri Lankas bilateral debt at the time of the 2022 economic crash, when Colombo ran out of foreign exchange to pay for essential imports such as food, fuel and medicines. Its economy is recovering after receiving an International Monetary Fund rescue package and imposing austerity reforms aimed at repairing the governments ruined finances. Leftist Dissanayake came to power in September on a pledge to fight corruption and tightened his grip after his party won a landslide in snap parliamentary polls. I will be going to China mid next month, he told reporters, without setting an exact date. Dissanayakes first overseas visit as head of state was to neighbouring India, where he was given a red-carpet welcome by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on December 16. Regional powerhouse India is competing fiercely with China for influence in the Indian Ocean region. Sri Lanka sits astride the worlds busiest shipping route, which links the Middle East and East Asia, giving its maritime assets strategic importance. New Delhi has been concerned about Beijings growing toehold in Sri Lanka, which it sees as being within its sphere of geopolitical influence. Fitch Ratings upgraded Sri Lankas long-term foreign currency issuer default rating to CCC on Friday. Fitch said that while debt restructuring had reduced the governments debt service burden and liquidity risks, it noted that the general government debtGDP and the interestrevenue ratio are likely to stay high in the medium term.

        "content": "Icelands president presented a new government on Saturday under Social Democratic Prime Minister Kristrun Frostadottir that aims to cut inflation and interest rates and hold a referendum on European Union membership by 2027, public broadcaster RUV said. Frostadottirs centre-left Social Democratic Alliance became the biggest party in a snap election on Nov. 30, and has agreed to form a coalition government with the centrist Peoples Party and the left-leaning, pro-European Reform Party, RUV said. Thorgerdur Katrin Gunnarsdottir, leader of the Reform Party, will be minister of foreign affairs, it added. It will be the first time in Iceland that the leaders of all the governing parties will be women, and the first time that the country will have a female prime minister and a female president - Halla Tomasdottir - simultaneously, the broadcaster said. A live stream from RUV showed the leaders of the three coalition parties hugging after they signed an agreement on forming a government. Frostadottir, 36, will be the youngest prime minister in Icelandic history, RUV said. The new coalition replaces a government by Bjarni Benediktssons conservative Independence Party which came second in the election, called after coalition disagreements and public discontent over migration and energy and housing issues. The new government plans to focus on bringing down inflation and interest rates, and aims to reduce the number of ministries by one in order to cut administrative costs, RUV reported, opens new tab on Saturday, citing Frostadottir. It also plans to formulate a parliamentary resolution to put the question of EU membership to a referendum, which the governing parties said they hope will take place no later than 2027, according to RUV. The new government also intends to set up a panel of independent experts to assess the advantages and disadvantages of retaining the Icelandic crown compared to adopting the Euro currency.

        "content": "Two U.S. Navy pilots were shot down Sunday over the Red Sea in an apparent friendly fire incident, the U.S military said. Both pilots were recovered alive, with one suffering minor injuries, but the incident underlines just how dangerous the Red Sea corridor has become after a year of ongoing attacks on shipping by Yemens Houthi rebels despite U.S. and European military coalitions patrolling the area. The U.S. military had conducted airstrikes targeting Yemens Houthi rebels at the time, though the U.S. militarys Central Command did not elaborate on what their mission was. The guided missile cruiser USS Gettysburg, which is part of the USS Harry S. Truman Carrier Strike Group, mistakenly fired on and hit the FA-18, which was flying off the USS Harry S. Truman, Central Command said in a statement. The Houthis have targeted about 100 merchant vessels with missiles and drones since the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip started in October 2023 after Hamas surprise attack on Israel that killed 1,200 people and saw 250 others taken hostage. Israels grinding offensive in Gaza has killed more than 45,000 Palestinians, local health officials say. The tally doesnt distinguish between combatants and civilians. The Houthis have seized one vessel and sunk two in a campaign that has also killed four sailors. Other missiles and drones have either been intercepted by separate U.S.- and European-led coalitions in the Red Sea or failed to reach their targets, which have also included Western military vessels. The rebels maintain that they target ships linked to Israel, the U.S. or the United Kingdom to force an end to Israels campaign against Hamas in Gaza. However, many of the ships attacked have little or no connection to the conflict, including some bound for Iran. Source: AP --Agencies",

        "date": "December 22, 2024 10:41 am",
        "content": "The Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) has issued a circular to licensed banks recently, highlighting relief measures to be provided to Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) affected by the Easter Sunday attacks, the COVID-19 pandemic, and the extraordinary macroeconomic conditions that prevailed in the recent past. These measures have been developed with the Sri Lanka Banks Association and are in line with the Working Committee on Recovery of Loans under the Special Provisions Amendment Act No. 26 of 2024. According to the new relief measures, loans provided to SMEs that have become non-performing loans will be rescheduled based on the borrowers ability to repay and an acceptable business revival plan. The CBSL stated that all rescheduling agreements must be finalized by June 15, 2025. Accordingly: SMEs with loan balances below Rs. 25 million must begin repayment by December 31, 2025. SMEs with loan balances between Rs.25 million and Rs.50 million must begin repayment by September 30, 2025. Repayment of loans above Rs.50 million must begin by June 30, 2025. Additionally, the CBSL claims that SMEs may receive interest waivers on unpaid amounts from April 2019 to December 15, 2024, depending on how quickly the interest is settled: A 65 waiver for loans between Rs. 5 million and Rs. 10 million if the interest is settled within 6 months. A 50 waiver for the same category if settled within 12 months. A 40 waiver if the interest is settled between 1 to 5 years. The CBSL further stated that banks should not reject new loan applications solely based on adverse CRIB records. It added that if relief is denied, borrowers should be informed of the reasons and given the option to appeal to the Director of the Financial Consumer Relations Department at the Central Bank. These relief measures will apply to SME borrowers whose loans became Stage 3 non-performing loans after April 1, 2019. Additionally, the CBSL emphasized that SMEs must engage with their banks Business Revival Units by March 31, 2025, and submit the required documents to be eligible for the relief.",

The statement addresses concerns raised by farmers and farmer organizations regarding the color of the fertilizer. After analyzing the composition of the imported stock and verifying other standards, it has been confirmed that the fertilizer meets the required quality standards. The ministry explained that the color of the fertilizer is influenced by the mineral salts in the deposit. Specifically, the presence of iron oxide gives the fertilizer a red color, while its absence results in a white color. The variation in color does not affect the fertilizers functionality and provide the same amount of potassium, it said. This clarification is based on findings from soil scientist Renuka de Silva, whose report confirmed that the fertilizer is safe and effective for use. The Ministry emphasized that farmers can use the donated fertilizer without any undue concerns.",

        "date": "December 22, 2024 10:58 am",
        "content": "A bizarre revelation has emerged in the ongoing investigation into bomb threats sent to several schools in Delhi. The Special Cell of Delhi Police has discovered that at least two schools in the Rohini district received threatening emails from their own students, who wanted to postpone exams due to lack of preparation. After investigation by the Special Cell of Delhi Police, it was found that the emails were sent to both schools by two different students of the same school, Delhi police said in a statement. Both students had sent this email to stop the exam because they were not prepared for the exam paper. Since both of them were students, they were counselled and then let off, police added. One of the schools that received bomb threats was Venkateshwar Global School, which received a threatening email a day after a mysterious blast occurred at the Rohini Prashant Vihar PVR Multiplex on November 28. Another school in Rohini received a threatening emails by one of its students. The reason was same  the student wanted the school to be shut. During counseling, the students confessed to their actions, and their parents were warned about the incident. The students also said that they had got the idea from previous incidents of bomb threats being made to schools. Earlier, the police conducted a thorough search of the school and declared the threat a hoax. The Delhi Police have been investigating a series of bomb threats sent to over 100 schools in the past 11 days. The emails were sent using a Virtual Private Network (VPN), making it challenging for the police to track down the perpetrators. This is not the first time that Delhi has seen a surge in bomb threats. Since May this year, over 50 bomb threat emails have targeted schools, hospitals, airports, and airline companies in the city. The police are yet to make any breakthroughs in these cases. The latest revelations have raised concerns about the motivations behind these threats and the need for increased vigilance and awareness among students and parents.

        "date": "December 22, 2024 11:07 am",
        "content": "Albanias prime minister has announced the government intends to block access to TikTok for one year after the killing of a schoolboy last month raised fears about the influence of social media on children. Speaking on Saturday Edi Rama declared the proposed ban would start in January. TikTok said it is seeking urgent clarifications from the Albanian government about the proposed ban. The social media platform told the BBC it had found no evidence the person who allegedly stabbed the 14-year-old boy, or the victim himself, had TikTok accounts. During a meeting in Albanias capital Tirana with teachers, parents and psychologists Rama branded TikTok as the thug of the neighbourhood. We are going to close it for a year and we are going to start rolling out programs that will serve the education of students and help parents follow their childrens journey, Rama said. The blocking of TikTok comes less than a month after the 14-year-old student was killed and another injured in a fight near a school in southern Tirana which had its roots in a confrontation on social media. The killing sparked a debate in Albania among parents, psychologists and educational institutions about the impact of social networks on young people. In China, TikTok promotes how students can take courses, how to protect nature, how to keep traditions, but on the TikTok outside China we see only scum and mud. Why do we need this?, Rama said. TikTok is already banned in India, which was one of the apps largest markets before it was outlawed in June 2020. It is also blocked in Iran, Nepal, Afghanistan and Somalia. TikTok is also fighting against a law passed by the US Congress which would ban the app from 19 January unless it is sold by ByteDance - its Chinese parent company. The US Supreme Court has agreed to hear last-minute legal arguments from TikTok as to why it should not be banned or sold with a hearing scheduled for 10 January - just days before the 19 January deadline imposed by Congress. The US government is taking action against the app because of what it says are its links to the Chinese state - links which TikTok and ByteDance have denied. Several European countries including France, Germany and Belgium have enforced restrictions on social media use for children. In November Australia passed the worlds strictest measures by voting to ban children under the age of 16 from using social media. That particular ban will take at least a year to implement. UK Technology Secretary Peter Kyle told the BBC that a similar ban for under-16s is on the table but added that he wanted to see more evidence first. Source: BBC --Agencies",

        "content": "Traders across various regions have urged the government to reconsider the Rs. 65 per kilogram tax imposed on imported rice, advocating for a reduction to alleviate market challenges. Consumer organizations echo these sentiments, emphasizing that a lower import tax could stabilize rice prices and make it more affordable for consumers. The government has implemented several measures in recent months to address the rice crisis, which has persisted for over two months. These efforts include setting maximum wholesale and retail price limits, conducting raids on rice mills through the Consumer Affairs Authority, and facilitating rice imports from foreign markets. According to Sri Lanka Customs, 67,000 metric tons of rice have been imported since import permissions were granted. This includes 38,500 metric tons of Nadu rice and 28,500 metric tons of raw rice. Sri Lanka Customs further disclosed that the government has generated Rs. 4.3 billion in import duties from these rice stocks, calculated at the rate of Rs. 65 per kilogram. While the influx of imported rice has eased shortages to some extent, reports from certain areas indicate that rice scarcity continues. Traders in some regions claim they still lack access to imported rice, although local rice is available.",

        "date": "December 22, 2024 01:49 pm",
        "content": "Talks to reach a Gaza ceasefire and hostage release deal between Israel and Hamas are 90 complete, but key issues remain that need to be bridged, a senior Palestinian official involved in the talks told the BBC. One of the main sticking points is the continued Israeli military presence in the Philadelphi corridor, a strategically important strip of land in southern Gaza along the border with Egypt. The Palestinian official shared details of the discussions being held in Doha which include the potential creation of a buffer zone several kilometres wide along the length of Israels border with Gaza. Israel would retain a military presence within this area, the official said. With these issues resolved, a three-stage ceasefire could be agreed within days, they added. The deal would include an exchange of 20 Palestinian prisoners for every female soldier released in the first of three stages of the ceasefire. The names of the prisoners are yet to be agreed but would be chosen from around 400 names who are serving prison sentences of 25 years or more in Israel. These are not thought to include the senior Fatah leader Marwan Barghouti, whose release Israel is expected to veto. Israeli hostages would be released in stages, as it is believed that Hamas still need to locate some of the missing hostages. Of 96 hostages still held in Gaza, 62 are assumed by Israel to still be alive. Gazan civilians would be able to return to the north, under a system with EgyptianQatari oversight, and there would be around 500 trucks per day bringing aid into the strip, the official said. In the final stage of the three-phase plan, which would see the end of the 14-month war, Gaza would be overseen by a committee of technocrats from the enclave, who would not have previous political affiliations but would have the backing of all Palestinian factions. In recent weeks, the US, Qatar and Egypt have resumed their mediation efforts and reported greater willingness by both sides to conclude a deal. A round of talks in mid-October failed to produce a deal, with Hamas rejecting a short-term ceasefire proposal. Hamas and two other Palestinian militant groups said that reaching a ceasefire agreement in Gaza has become closer than ever before only if Israel stops imposing new conditions. In a Telegram statement on Saturday, the group said it held a meeting in Cairo on Friday on the ongoing negotiation efforts with representatives from the Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP). The Palestinian Islamist armed group Hamas, which governed Gaza, carried out an unprecedented cross-border attack in southern Israel on 7 October 2023. About 1,200 people were killed and 251 others abducted. More than 100 hostages have been freed through negotiations or Israeli military rescue operations. Source: BBC --Agencies",

The accident occurred at around 10.00 a.m. when a private passenger bus travelling from Hatton to Kandy veered off the road and plunged 20 feet down a concrete embankment. Initial investigations suggest that the driver lost control of the vehicle. During police interrogations, the bus driver claimed that the bus door had opened, causing him to lose balance and nearly fall out. In an attempt to hold on to the steering wheel, he was unable to regain control, leading to the crash. Police have discovered that someone had later deleted the CCTV footage recorded during the accident. However, using advanced technology methods, the police successfully recovered the footage, which they say provides critical evidence regarding the incident. Hatton Acting Magistrate S. Rammoorthi has ordered the bus driver to be remanded until December 26 in connection with the accident. However, due to injuries sustained during the crash, the driver is currently receiving treatment at the Dickoya Base Hospital under police custody.",

        "date": "December 23, 2024 08:38 am",
        "content": "President-elect Donald Trump threatened to reassert U.S. control over the Panama Canal on Sunday, accusing Panama of charging excessive rates to use the Central American passage and drawing a sharp rebuke from Panamanian President Jose Raul Mulino. Speaking to a crowd of supporters in Arizona, Trump also said he would not let the canal fall into the wrong hands, warning of potential Chinese influence on the passage. After the event, he posted an image on Truth Social of an American flag flying over a narrow body of water, with the comment: Welcome to the United States Canal! Has anyone ever heard of the Panama Canal? Trump said at AmericaFest, an annual event organized by Turning Point, an allied conservative group. Because were being ripped off at the Panama Canal like were being ripped off everywhere else. Trumps comments were an exceedingly rare example of a U.S. leader saying he could push a sovereign country to hand over territory. They also underlined an expected shift in U.S. diplomacy under Trump, who has not historically shied away from threatening allies and using bellicose rhetoric when dealing with counterparts. It was given to Panama and the people of Panama, but it has provisions, Trump said of the canal, which was once owned by the United States but was handed over to Panama decades ago. If the principles, both moral and legal, of this magnanimous gesture of giving are not followed, then we will demand that the Panama Canal be returned to us, in full, quickly and without question. In a recorded message released by Panamas President Mulino on Sunday afternoon, the nations leader said that Panamas independence was non-negotiable and that China had no influence on the canals administration. He also defended the passage rates Panama charged, saying they were not set on a whim. China does not control or administer the canal, but a subsidiary of Hong Kong-based CK Hutchison Holdings has long managed two ports located on the canals Caribbean and Pacific entrances. The United States largely built the canal and administered territory surrounding the passage for decades. But the United States and Panama signed a pair of accords in 1977 that paved the way for the canals return to full Panamanian control. The United States handed over control of the passage in 1999 after a period of joint administration. Every square meter of the Panama Canal and the surrounding area belongs to Panama and will continue belonging (to Panama), Mulino said in his statement, which was released on X. Trump then responded to Mulino: Well see about that! The waterway, which allows up to 14,000 ships to cross per year, accounts for 2.5 of global seaborne trade and is critical to U.S. imports of autos and commercial goods by container ships from Asia, and for U.S. exports of commodities, including liquefied natural gas. It is not clear how Trump would seek to regain control over the canal, and he would have no recourse under international law if he decided to make a play for the passage. This is not the first time Trump has openly considered territorial expansion. In recent weeks, he has repeatedly mused about turning Canada into a U.S. state, though it is unclear how serious he is about the matter. During his 2017-2021 term, Trump expressed interest in buying Greenland, an autonomous territory of Denmark. He was publicly rebuffed by Danish authorities before any conversations could take place. Trump repeated the idea on Sunday, in a statement announcing his pick for ambassador to Denmark, Ken Howery, a former ambassador to Sweden. For purposes of National Security and Freedom throughout the World, the United States of America feels that the ownership and control of Greenland is an absolute necessity, he wrote on Truth Social.

The two automakers are hosting board meetings on Monday about the talks and will later hold a joint press conference that Nissans alliance partner Mitsubishi Motors is also expected to attend, the people said. A merger of the three Japanese brands would create the worlds third-largest auto group by vehicle sales after Toyota and Volkswagen , in what would be the biggest industry-reshaping deal since the 2021 formation of Stellantis . Honda and Nissan have been exploring ways to bolster their partnership, including setting up a joint holding company, as they face growing challenges from Tesla and Chinese rivals, Reuters reported last week. Honda, Japans second-biggest automaker, and Nissan, the third-largest, said in March they were considering cooperation on electrification and software development. They agreed to conduct joint research and widened the collaboration to Mitsubishi Motors in August. Last month, Nissan announced a plan to cut 9,000 jobs and 20 of its global production capacity after its sales plunged in its key China and U.S. markets. Honda also reported a worse-than-expected earnings result due to declining sales in China. Forms of integration being discussed include Honda supplying hybrid vehicles to Nissan and the joint use of Nissans car assembly factory in Britain, Kyodo News reported on Saturday. The companies aim to finalise the integration talks in June 2025, public broadcaster NHK reported. French automaker Renault , Nissans largest shareholder, is open in principle to a deal and would examine all the implications of a tie-up, sources have said. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

The agency in a post on X said the plane hit the chimney of a home and then the second floor of a building before crashing into a mobile phone shop in a largely residential neighborhood of Gramado. More than a dozen people who were on the ground were taken to hospitals with injuries including smoke inhalation, with two said to be in critical condition. It is not immediately clear what caused the crash. Local media reported that the plane was piloted by Luiz Claudio Galeazzi, a Brazilian businessman who was travelling with his family to Sao Paulo State. In a statement published on LinkedIn, Galeazzis company, Galeazzi  Associados, confirmed that the 61-year-old was on the plane, adding that he was traveling with his wife, their three daughters, several other family members and another company employee, who perished in the crash.

        "date": "December 23, 2024 11:18 am",
        "content": "Stepping onto the set of Squid Game season two, Lee Jong-jae felt like he had never left. Including promotion, Id been living with Gi-hun for about two years, said Lee in a recent interview. I really felt like I was him, he said in a recent interview. Squid Game follows an underground competition in Korea that recruits people in debt to participate in childlike games for money. Once the games begin, the contestants realize there are deadly consequences. The show was a global hit when it was released in 2021, becoming Netflixs most-watched series. It also won numerous accolades including Primetime Emmy Awards for acting for Lee Jung-jae and directing for Hwang Dong-hyuk. Lees career catapulted, taking him to the Cannes Film Festival and giving him his first English-language role in the Star Wars series The Acolyte for Disney. Lee says when Netflix ordered a second season of Squid Game, he questioned the timeline because it took Hwang years to work on the first one. I wondered, How many years will it take him to write season two, said Lee. Hwang, in turn, surprised everyone  including himself  by taking just six months to write season two and a third and final season. Im not sure Ill ever be able to write something that fast again, he said. Creating new characters and their individual stories came easily. The biggest, challenge, Hwang said, was deciding what should happen with Gi-hun. Lee says when he read the scripts he thought Hwang really is a genius. Its rare for even successful TV shows in Korea to have more than one season so it was a big swing, even for the new cast. Theres a Korean phrase, theres not a sequel that does better than its prequel, said actor Yang Dong-geong, whose character debuts in season two. Ive been careful because we arent really sure what the reaction will be. The outlook is positive. Season two has already been nominated in the best drama series category at the upcoming Golden Globe Awards. The opportunity to work on a project with worldwide appeal is a dream come true for a performer. Lee Byung-hun, who reprises his villain role from season one, has appeared in big budget English-language films like G.I. Joe: The Rise of the Cobra with Channing Tatum and Dennis Quaid and Red 2 with Bruce Willis. Its Squid Game that he credits for taking his career to another level. Ive been an actor for over three decades and ... maybe most people outside of Korea have never seen anything that Ive been in. If anyone through Squid Game wishes to see more of me or becomes more curious about my previous works, as an actor, nothing would be more rewarding or bring me greater joy. The audition process moved slowly. Jo Yu-ri recalls waiting two months between the first and second-round. When she finally got the part Jo says, I actually remember crying. The actors were asked to not speak publicly about their casting to wait for Netflix to make an announcement. There were a couple of close friends that popped champagne for me when they found out, said Yang. Netflixs Squid Game universe is also growing. A second season of a reality competition show based on the series has been ordered and an English version is in development. Season three of the original has also completed filming and is in post-production. Season two is not without controversy. The new episodes feature a transgender character played by Park Sung-hoon. Hwang says he understands why hiring a trans actor would have been ideal, but that the casting is a reflection of how the LGBTQ community and gender identity is viewed in Korea. To be honest with you, in Korea, when it comes to the LGBTQ and gender minority community and culture compared to the Western worlds, its not as widely socially accepted yet. Unfortunately, a lot of the groups are marginalized and neglected from society, which is heartbreaking, said Hwang. We dont have a very large pool of actors that allow for authentic casting when it comes to transgender characters. We did our research. We tried to find someone who we thought could be the best fit. However, we werent able to. Hwang also went on to say that Parks talent and approach to the character ended up making him the perfect fit. Source: AP --Agencies",

The Jharkhand plant with 2X800 MW capacity is a dedicated project of Adani Power to supply electricity to Bangladesh. The company has reduced the quantum of power supply from the plant to Bangladesh amid some issues due to political changes in Bangladesh. Although the Indian government recently allowed the sales of power in the domestic market to sustain the project, a fresh transmission network is necessary in this regard, according to The Hindu Business Line. However, the selling power to Sri Lanka from the Godda plant will require consent from the Bangladesh government. I believe they will require the consent of the Bangladesh Power Development Authority for sales of power to Sri Lanka from the Godda plant, Muhammad Fouzul Kabir Khan, the adviser for the Ministry of Power, Energy and Mineral Resources of Bangladesh, told the Indian news outlet.

Issuing a statement, the ICRC said that the conference provided a much-needed humanitarian space for families of missing persons to interact with families from other communities, exchange views, discuss common challenges faced in searching for their missing loved ones and how to overcome them collectively. During the event, the participants reiterated the need to know the fate and whereabouts of their missing loved ones, the ICRC added. The conference also served as a forum for families to engage in a dialogue with the relevant authorities on improving the existing processes and mechanisms available to address the multifaceted needs of families of missing persons. The families had the opportunity to share their stories directly with the Minister of Justice and National Integration, Deputy Minister of National Integration, Secretary to the Prime Minister and officials from the Office on Missing Persons who were present at the event to listen to the experiences of families, answer their queries and receive their recommendations. Some of the specific issues raised by the families include the need to receive answers on the fate and whereabouts of their missing loved ones, the need for support, and the need for acknowledgement of their suffering, according to the ICRC. The first of its kind, the National Conference for the Families of Missing Persons in Sri Lanka was conceptualized, in consultation with families of missing persons, following the success of the ICRC-facilitated Global Family Conference held last year, where 37 families of missing persons from Sri Lanka shared their experiences with families from other countries. The conference was organised by the ICRC as part of its neutral and intermediary role with the view of contributing to the resolution of the issue of missing persons in Sri Lanka, the statement highlighted.",

Sri Lankas credit profile reflects the reduction in external vulnerability and government liquidity risk, and prospects for fiscal and debt sustainability, Moodys said in a report. Sri Lankas credit fundamentals have improved over the past two years... external vulnerability and government liquidity risk have both declined from elevated levels, Moodys said. The island nation had defaulted on its foreign debt for the first time in May 2022 due to its high debt burden and dwindling foreign exchange reserves. Its bondholders last week signed off on the governments proposal to restructure its international bonds as the island nation recovers from its worst financial crisis in decades. The rating action marked the conclusion of a review Moodys initiated last month, in which it had indicated a possible upgrade. Ratings agency Fitch on Friday raised Sri Lankas long-term foreign-currency default rating to CCC from restricted default. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "content": "The private passenger bus that involved in a tragic accident in the Malliappuwa area on Saturday (21), while traveling from Hatton to Kandy, was inspected by the Nuwara Eliya District Chief Motor Vehicle Inspector today (23), revealing serious safety violations concerning the bus involved. Initial investigations had confirmed that a malfunctioning lock in the drivers side door caused the door to suddenly open, ejecting the driver from his seat and leading to the accident. At the request of the Hatton Police Traffic Division, the bus, currently in police custody, was thoroughly examined by the District Chief Motor Vehicle Inspector. According to the Chief Motor Vehicle Inspector, the doors lock had been defective for some time, prompting them to resort to temporary measures to keep it closed. Additionally, the driver was found not to have been wearing a seat belt, exacerbating the consequences of the accident. The inspection also uncovered several unauthorized modifications to the bus, including the installation of various metal objects and ornaments that had inflicted severe injuries on passengers during the crash. It was further noted that the seats on the bus were not installed according to safety standards, which led to their detachment and caused significant harm to the passengers. The tragic accident claimed three lives and left approximately 50 passengers injured. In response to these findings, the Chief Motor Vehicle Inspector urged Traffic Police to enforce stricter regulations, prohibiting the installation of non-standard devices on passenger vehicles and removing any existing unauthorized modifications. However, Hatton Police stated that legal action will be initiated against the bus owner for operating a vehicle unsuitable for passenger transport services, with the case set to be heard before the Hatton Magistrates Court.",

        "content": "An organization in Sri Lanka posing as an IT company is recruiting locals who speak Japanese to target Japanese nationals with investment scams, a local who briefly worked there has told Kyodo News. While the extent of the damage caused by the phone scammers is unknown, the former worker said in an interview last month that he heard that some victims had transferred as much as 30 million yen (192,000) to the organizations account from Japan. There have been a series of phone and online fraud committed by Japanese scammers based in Southeast Asian countries, but cases in South Asia involving locals hired to victimize people in Japan appear to be rare. The Sri Lankan man, who is fluent in Japanese after having worked in Japan, said the organization in Colombo, the capital, appeared to involve more than 100 workers, though apparently without any Japanese among them. He quit the job as he was hesitant to be engaged in defrauding people in the country he feels gratitude toward for his stay. The man said he found the job information in a Facebook post, which offered a salary of about 250,000 Sri Lankan rupees (855). He was given a list of telephone numbers in Japan to call from a room in the building where the companys office is located. He was instructed to make investment sales pitches in Japanese by phone, using an app to conceal the origin of the call from Sri Lanka. Source: Kyodo News --Agencies",
