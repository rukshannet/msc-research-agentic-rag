        "date": "October 25, 2023 06:24 pm",
        "content": "A total of 168 girls aged under 16 have reportedly been sexually abused in the country within the month of September 2023, State Minister of Women and Child Affairs, Geetha Kumarasinghe revealed. Speaking to the media in this regard this afternoon (25 Oct.), the State Minister noted that of 168 cases of abuse, 22 of them resulted in child pregnancies. Thus, the State Minister urged Sri Lankas Police Department to take strict actions in this regard, and further called for the highest possible punishment to be meted out to those found guilty of such crimes. She further requested all parents, school teachers and principals to remain vigilant, and protect their children from potentially falling prey to such attacks, highlighting that most of the time, children are often abused by a close family member, someone in their own home. The State Minister noted that while discussions pertaining to these growing concerns are due to be held with the President, measures have already been taken to introduce new Acts pertaining to the protection of women and children. When questioned as to what or who was to be blamed for these staggering figures, Kumarasinghe replied that while the police force too, is to be blamed for their negligence, the increased use of narcotic substances too, plays an integral role in such crimes. Thus, she noted that while she, in her capacity as the State Minister of Women and Child Affairs, is responsible for the safety of women and children, Sri Lankas society, as a whole, too, bears such a responsibility.",

        "date": "October 25, 2023 11:57 pm",
        "content": "A Chinese research ship docked at a Sri Lankan port on Wednesday, likely adding to neighboring Indias concerns about Chinas growing influence in the Indian Ocean. The arrival of the Shi Yan 6 follows last years visit by a Chinese naval vessel. The latest ship was given permission to dock for replenishment at the port of Colombo, the Indian Ocean islands main port, from Wednesday until Oct. 28, said foreign ministry spokesman Kapila Fonseka. The vessel had been expected to conduct research with Sri Lankan state institutions, but Fonseka said permission was granted only for replenishment and no research work would be carried out. The particular permission is very clear, he said. According to Chinese television network CGTN, Shi Yan 6 is a geophysical scientific research vessel on an expeditionary voyage in the eastern area of the Indian Ocean. Organized by the South China Sea Institute of Oceanology under the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the vessel is scheduled to operate at sea for 80 days, covering a range of more than 12,000 nautical miles (roughly 22,200 kilometres), CGTN reported. China has been trying to expand its influence in Sri Lanka, which is located on one of the worlds busiest shipping routes in what India considers part of its strategic backyard. Beijing was once widely seen as having an upper hand with its free-flowing loans and infrastructure investments. But Sri Lankas economic collapse last year provided an opportunity for India as New Delhi stepped in with massive financial and material assistance. Two weeks ago, Sri Lanka reached an agreement with Export-Import Bank of China on key terms and principles for restructuring its debt, an important step toward unlocking a second installment of a 2.9 billion package from the International Monetary Fund aimed at helping the island nation from its dire economic crisis. Sri Lanka declared bankruptcy in April 2022 with more than 83 billion in debt, more than half to foreign creditors. China accounts for about 10 of Sri Lankas loans, trailing Japan and the Asian Development Bank. Sri Lanka borrowed heavily from China over the past decade for infrastructure projects including a seaport, airport and a city being built on reclaimed land. The projects failed to earn enough revenue to pay for the loans, and in 2017, Sri Lanka leased the seaport in Hambantota to China. Last year, Chinese navy vessel Yuan Wang 5 docked at Hambantota in southern Sri Lanka. There were fears in India that the vessel could be used to surveil the region.

        "date": "October 25, 2023 11:59 pm",
        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe, addressing the 117th Anniversary of the Institution of Engineers, has outlined plans for modernizing the Agriculture Ministry. The Head of State expressed his intention to seek external assistance to design a new Agricultural Ministry by studying how similar ministries function in countries like Thailand and Malaysia, the Presidents Media Division (PMD) said. He has emphasized the need for a well-defined ministerial structure for progress. Wickremesinghe also discussed the next stage of modernizing agriculture, including the utilization of previously unused land, particularly in the Mahaweli area and plantations, covering approximately 700,000 to a million acres. Additionally, he pointed out the importance of incorporating various Agriculture Research Institutes into a single institution called the University for Agricultural Technology and engaging the private sector. This holistic approach aims to modernize agriculture, with a focus not only on education in agriculture but also in engineering, the PMD explained. Additionally, the President made a significant announcement about the amalgamation of the plantation industries and agriculture sectors, which were separated since 1970. He discussed the historical context of this separation and the need to modernize the agricultural sector. Wickremesinghe encouraged collaboration and input from the Institution of Engineers and left the door open for on-going consultation as these plans develop and progress. The President also highlighted the pivotal role of engineering in Sri Lankas future development. He emphasized the significant contributions of engineers to the nation, both historically and in the present, mentioning milestones such as the construction of the Kandy Road and the Mahaweli program, which was completed in a remarkably short time frame. Wickremesinghe underscored the need for a forward-looking approach, especially in the context of debt restructuring and the pursuit of a new, sustainable economy. He identified three key areas where engineers would play a crucial role: competitiveness, digital transformation and the green economy. Regarding competitiveness, he stressed that engineering skills are essential for Sri Lanka to become highly competitive in various fields. He highlighted the importance of engineers in building the digital economy, predicting a gradual transformation over the next decade. Furthermore, the President discussed the potential for green hydrogen exports, which could be a unique opportunity for Sri Lanka, further emphasizing the role of engineers in this endeavour. The President acknowledged the need for engineering technology in all these areas, noting that without it, progress would be challenging. He encouraged the growth of engineering talent to meet these future demands, suggesting that the country should double its estimates to account for engineers going abroad. Wickremesinghe also emphasized the importance of technical education and vocational engineering skills in addressing the shortage of human resources needed for these technological advancements. He indicated that the government would propose innovative solutions in this regard during the budget report. In conclusion, the Head of State called on the Institution of Engineers to actively participate in these initiatives to propel Sri Lanka towards a new economy, marked by technological innovation and agricultural modernization.",

        "date": "October 26, 2023 12:37 am",
        "content": "Indias National Investigation Agency (NIA) has arrested a 39-year-old man, who had been wanted in a human trafficking case involving Sri Lankan nationals, from Tamil Nadu after a hunt of more than two years, an official said. Mohamed Imran Khan alias Haja Najerbheeden, allegedly a key figure in the case, was on the run since June 2021, a spokesperson of the federal agency said. The official said the Absconder Tracking Team (ATT) from the NIAs Bengaluru office monitored Khans movements for the last several months, leading to his arrest from Theni district in Tamil Nadu on Sunday. The NIA spokesperson said a preliminary investigation has revealed that Khan, a resident of Ramanathapuram in Tamil Nadu, is a notorious smuggler with a long-standing history of illegal activities in the region. He was a fugitive wanted by multiple law-enforcement agencies for his involvement in various illicit operations, the official said. The spokesperson said the instant case originated when the Mangalore South Police acted on credible intelligence that a group of Sri Lankan nationals had arrived and taken residence in Mangalore in Karnataka without possessing valid documents. An operation led to the arrest of 38 Sri Lankan nationals from Mangalore on June 6, 2021. Investigations revealed that Sri Lankan nationals were brought to Mangalore from Sri Lanka via Tamil Nadu and Bengaluru. Recognising the international dimensions of the case, the NIA intervened and re-registered the case, the spokesperson said. The official said the investigation revealed that Khan, in collaboration with a Sri Lankan national, Eesan, formerly associated with the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), devised a plan to illegally transport 38 Sri Lankan nationals from their home country to various locations in Tamil Nadu. They lured these individuals with false promises, including the prospect of obtaining legitimate documentation for emigration to Canada and securing employment opportunities. Khan, along with the other co-accused, trafficked Sri Lankan nationals to various locations in Bengaluru and Mangaluru, the spokesperson said. The investigation also revealed that Khan is a pivotal figure in a broader conspiracy involving international human trafficking. He acted as the main conduit responsible for transporting Sri Lankan nationals from their home country to India and subsequently, to other nations, the NIA spokesperson said. The federal agency filed a preliminary chargesheet against five individuals  Dhinakaran alias Ayya, Kasi Viswanathan, Rasool, Satham Ushen and Abdul Muheetu  on October 5, 2021, while a total of 13 suspects have so far been arraigned by it in the case.

        "content": "At least 16 people were killed Wednesday in shootings in Lewiston, Maine, and the death toll is expected to rise, foreign media reported. The officials said multiple people had also been wounded. Investigators were still processing the crime scenes and working to gather evidence. Police were searching for the man who opened fire Wednesday at two locations in the city. The officials were not authorized to publicly discuss details of the ongoing investigation and spoke to AP on condition of anonymity. Lewiston Police said in an earlier Facebook post that they were dealing with an active shooter incident at Schemengees Bar and Grille and Sparetime Recreation, a bowling alley. Please stay off the roads to allow emergency responders access to the hospitals, police said. On its website, Central Maine Medical Center said staff were reacting to a mass casualty, mass shooter event and were coordinating with area hospitals to take in patients. The alert for Lewiston was made shortly after 8 p.m. as the Androscoggin County Sheriffs Office reported that law enforcement agencies were investigating two active shooter events. The sheriffs office said the suspect was still at large. We are encouraging all businesses to lock down and or close while we investigate, the sheriffs office reported. A spokesperson for Maine Department of Public Safety urged residents to stay in their homes with their doors locked. Law enforcement is currently investigating at two locations right now, Shannon Moss said. Again please stay off the streets and allow law enforcement to diffuse the situation. The Androscoggin County Sheriffs Office released two photos of the suspect on its Facebook page that showed a gunman walking into an establishment with a weapon raised to his shoulder. Gov. Janet Mills released a statement echoing those instructions. She said she has been briefed on the situation and will remain in close contact with public safety officials. Ange Amores, a spokesperson for the city of Lewiston, said city officials are not commenting on the shooting. Amores said Maine State Police were planning to hold a news conference, likely at city hall, to update the public on Wednesday night. Maine Sen. Angus King, an independent, said he was deeply sad for the city of Lewiston and all those worried about their family, friends and neighbors and was monitoring the situation. Kings office said the senator would be headed directly home to Maine once the Senates final vote is held Thursday afternoon. Source: The Associated Press --Agencies",

The lawmaker also mentioned that the government is taking steps to establish stable policies that will remain consistent through changes in government. As a result, the foreign employment policy for the next five years has been made public at present, the Presidents Media Division (PMD) said in a press release. He made these remarks during a news conference held at the Presidential Media Center on Wednesday (25) under the theme of Collective Path to a Stable Country. Minister Manusha Nanayakkara further said; We are taking various measures to recover from the economic crisis that the country has faced. This period can be considered a time when the most laws, both new and existing, were passed in history. Citizens have taken to the streets, protesting that the country requires a System Change. In order to enact this change, the government is diligently working to replace outdated laws and regulations with those more suitable for the present. Furthermore, the government is currently formulating stable policies that will remain unchanged with shifts in government. Today, the five-year foreign employment policy, prepared accordingly, was officially announced. Its worth mentioning that the government intends to develop such policies for all sectors. Other international financial institutions, including the International Monetary Fund, and other countries, have expressed their willingness to assist in rebuilding our economy, but they require financial discipline in the country. Therefore, a program for financial discipline in the country will be implemented in the near future. The President is also actively working to establish various committees, including the Committee on Discipline of Members of Parliament. The bill addressing the discipline of members of parliament has been presented to the cabinet. This bill was prepared by a committee led by former Speaker Mr. Karu Jayasuriya, with a focus on the British Parliaments standards. Additionally, its a significant achievement to have finally passed the anti-corruption bill, which has been discussed for two decades. A report has been compiled after analyzing public administration, with the aim of conducting public capital administration without corruption. A commission, led by former Chief Justice Priyasad Dep, will be appointed to investigate the financial practices of political parties. The committee will examine how political parties should operate. In the future, the public will have the opportunity to submit their suggestions and recommendations to the committee. Efforts have also been made to establish a budget office within the Parliament. Committees have been appointed to oversee economic stability, as well as methods and procedures. Effective human resource management is vital for the country; therefore, we are working on amending the Labor Act, anticipating significant changes in the labor sector. Additionally, we have devised numerous programs to provide assistance to our citizens working abroad and enhance their professional security.",

        "date": "October 26, 2023 10:18 am",
        "content": "Hundreds of police searched the city of Lewiston and surrounding areas of Maine state for a man sought in connection with mass shootings at a bar and a bowling alley, as news outlets reported a death toll ranging from 16 to 22, with dozens more wounded. Officials said there were multiple casualties but declined to provide figures. State and local police identified Robert R. Card, 40, as a person of interest in the case after previously posting on Facebook photographs of a man wielding what appeared to be a semi-automatic rifle. The pictures from one of Wednesdays crime scenes showed a bearded man in a brown hoodie and jeans, holding the weapon in the firing position. We have literally hundreds of police officers working around the state of Maine to investigate this case to locate Mr. Card, who is a person of interest, Maine Public Safety Commissioner Mike Sauschuck told a news conference. Several media reported that a Maine law enforcement bulletin identified Card as a trained firearms instructor and member of the U.S. Army reserve who recently reported that he had mental health issues, including hearing voices. It also said he threatened to shoot up a National Guard base. Card was also reported to have been committed to mental health facility for two weeks during summer 2023 and subsequently released, said the notice from the Maine Information  Analysis Center. Reuters could not authenticate the bulletin. The Associated Press reported it was circulated to law enforcement officials. The bar and the bowling alley are about four miles (6.5 km) apart in Lewiston, a former textile hub and town of 38,000 people in Androscoggin County about 35 miles (56 km) north of Maines largest city, Portland. Media reports picked up by Reuters earlier said there was a third shooting site at a Walmart distribution center, but Walmart later issued a statement to local media saying no shooting occurred on their property. The Central Maine Medical Center in Lewiston issued a statement saying it was reacting to a mass casualty, mass shooter event and coordinating with area hospitals to take patients. President Joe Biden has been briefed and will continue to receive updates, a U.S. official said in Washington. The president spoke by phone individually to Maine Governor Janet Mills, Senators Angus King and Susan Collins, and Congressman Jared Golden about the shooting in Lewiston and offered full federal support in the wake of the attack, the White House said. If the death toll of 22 is confirmed, the massacre would be the deadliest in the United States since at least August 2019, when a gunman opened fire on shoppers at an El Paso Walmart with an AK-47 rifle, killing 23 in a shooting that prosecutors branded an anti-Hispanic hate crime, according to the Gun Violence Archive. The 22 fatalities would also be on par with the number of homicides that normally occur in Maine in any given year. The number of annual homicides in the state has fluctuated between 16 and 29 since 2012, according to Maine State Police. The number of U.S. shootings in which four or more people were shot has surged since the COVID-19 pandemic began in 2020, with 647 occurring in 2022 and 679 projected to occur in 2023, based on trends as of July, according to data from the archive. The deadliest U.S. mass shooting on record is the massacre of 58 people by a gunman firing on a Las Vegas country music festival from a high-rise hotel perch in 2017. Source: Reuters -Agencies",

        "date": "October 26, 2023 01:30 pm",
        "content": "Israeli troops and tanks launched a brief ground raid into northern Gaza overnight into Thursday, the military said, striking several militant targets in order to prepare the battlefield ahead of a widely expected ground invasion after more than two weeks of devastating air raids. The raid came after the U.N. warned it is on the verge of running out of fuel in the Gaza Strip, forcing it to sharply curtail relief efforts in the territory, which has also been under a complete siege since Hamas bloody rampage across southern Israel ignited the war earlier this month. The rising death tolls in Gaza are unprecedented in the decades-long Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Even greater loss of life could come if Israel launches an expected ground offensive aimed at crushing Hamas, which has ruled Gaza since 2007 and survived four previous wars with Israel. The Health Ministry in Hamas-ruled Gaza said Wednesday that more than 750 people were killed over the past 24 hours, higher than the 704 killed the previous day. The Associated Press could not independently verify the death toll, and the ministry does not distinguish between civilians and combatants. By comparison, 2,251 Palestinians, mostly civilians, were killed in the entire six-week-long war in 2014, according to U.N. figures. The Israeli military says it only strikes militant targets and accuses Hamas of operating among civilians in densely-populated Gaza. Palestinian militants have fired rocket barrages into Israel since the war began. During the overnight raid, the military said soldiers struck fighters, militant infrastructure and anti-tank missile launching positions. There were no immediate reports of casualties on either aide. Meanwhile, an airstrike hit a residential building in the southern town of Khan Younis early Thursday. Ambulances streamed into the nearby Nasser Hospital, but there was no official word on casualties. Family members said the building had housed 75 people, including 25 displaced relatives. The Gaza Health Ministry says more than 6,500 Palestinians have been killed in the war. That figure includes the disputed toll from an explosion at a hospital last week. The fighting has killed more than 1,400 people in Israel, mostly civilians slain during the initial Hamas attack, according to the Israeli government. Hamas also holds some 222 hostages in Gaza. The warning by the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, over depleting fuel supplies raised alarm that the humanitarian crisis could quickly worsen. Gazas population has also been running out of food, water and medicine. About 1.4 million of Gazas 2.3 million residents have fled their homes, with nearly half of them crowded into U.N. shelters. Hundreds of thousands remain in northern Gaza, despite Israel ordering them to evacuate to the south, saying those who remain might be considered accomplices of Hamas. In recent days, Israel let more than 60 trucks with aid enter from Egypt, which aid workers say is insufficient and only a tiny fraction of what was being brought in before the war. Israel is still barring deliveries of fuel  needed to power generators  saying it believes Hamas will take it. An official with the International Committee of the Red Cross said it hopes to bring in nearly a half dozen trucks filled with vital medical supplies. This is a small amount of what is required, a drop in the ocean if you will, given the severity of the consequences of the violence in the last two and a half weeks, said William Schomburg, head of the sub-delegation in Gaza. Today, we are looking at eight to ten trucks coming in. We have more that are lined up, he said. We are trying to establish a pipeline. UNRWA has been sharing its own fuel supplies so that trucks can distribute aid, bakeries can feed people in shelters, water can be desalinated, and hospitals can keep incubators, life support machines and other vital equipment working. If it continues doing all of that, fuel will run out by Thursday, so the agency is deciding how to ration its supply, UNRWA spokeswoman Tamara Alrifai told The Associated Press. Do we give for the incubators or the bakeries? she said. It is an excruciating decision. More than half of Gazas primary health care facilities and roughly a third of its hospitals have stopped functioning, the World Health Organization said. At Gaza Citys al-Shifa Hospital, the lack of medicine and clean water have led to alarming infection rates, the group Doctors Without Borders said. Amputations are often required to prevent infection from spreading in the wounded, it said. One surgeon with the group described amputating half the foot of a 9-year-old boy with only slight sedation on a hallway floor as his mother and sister watched. The conflict has also threatened to spread across the region. The Israeli military said Wednesday it struck military sites in Syria in response to rocket launches from the country. Syrian state media said eight soldiers were killed and seven wounded. Strikes in Syria also hit the airports of Aleppo and Damascus, in an apparent attempt to prevent arms shipments from Iran to militant groups, including Lebanons Hezbollah. Israel has been exchanging near daily fire with Iranian-backed Hezbollah across the Lebanese border. Hamas surprise rampage on Oct. 7 in southern Israel stunned the country with its brutality, its unprecedented toll and the failure of intelligence agencies to know it was coming. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a speech Wednesday night that he will be held accountable, but only after Hamas was defeated. We will get to the bottom of what happened, he said. This debacle will be investigated. Everyone will have to give answers, including me. Source: Associated Press -Agencies",

        "content": "Embracing Information Technology (IT) is no longer a choice but a necessity, President Ranil Wickremesinghe has said, emphasizing the paramount significance of digital transformation in securing Sri Lankas economic prosperity. The Head of State made these remarks while addressing the National ICT Awards NBQSA 2023 held in Colombo on Wednesday (Oct. 25), the Presidents Media Division (PMD) said in a press release. The event was organized by the British Computer Society, the Chartered Institute for IT  Sri Lanka Section. Using this occasion to convey an essential message, President Wickremesinghe urged everyone to recognize the significance of the future. The president emphasized that the future lies within the hands of each individual and their accomplishments are intrinsically tied to the nations prosperity. He expressed his good wishes for the path ahead, stating, The future is in your hands and your success is the countrys success. Wickremesinghe also outlined a definitive vision for Sri Lankas future, marking a pivotal shift towards collective responsibility and progress. As the nation looks forward to the upcoming year, the president stressed the importance of united efforts, underlining that success is contingent on collaboration between the government and its citizens. Reflecting on his earlier efforts as the Minister of Education to introduce IT in Sri Lanka, the president acknowledged the missed opportunities and economic setbacks resulting from underutilizing the global IT wave. However, he underlined that it is time to move beyond past failures, with the present representing Sri Lankas final opportunity to partake in the digital revolution. Wickremesinghe has outlined a comprehensive vision for Sri Lankas digital future, centred on competitiveness, green transformation and digital transformation. He acknowledged that this journey is not devoid of challenges and necessitates not only favourable laws and regulations but also substantial investment in digital infrastructure and human capital development. In building a highly competitive and contemporary economy, Ive highlighted two additional crucial components. First is the promotion of a green economy, leveraging our renewable energy resources and embracing the global trend towards sustainability, recognizing the on-going global green transformation. In the upcoming budget speech scheduled for next month, the initial phases of this reinvigorated economic vision will be delineated. Simultaneously, we will introduce legislation to facilitate this transition. Its worth noting that our economic history witnessed a pivotal shift in 1977 when laws governing a state-controlled socialist economy were repealed, ushering in a market-oriented economic model. Wickremesinghe encouraged collaborative efforts between the private sector and the government to foster IT human capital across all levels, from postgraduates to skilled workers, recognizing that government initiatives alone may prove inadequate. The president emphasized the need for a well-defined roadmap and adequate funding to materialize this digital transformation. He also noted the potential requirement for foreign investments to expedite the process, given the rapid pace of technological advancements. He called on the ICT industry to accept the challenge, drawing parallels with the transformative journey undertaken by the apparel industry in the past. He expressed optimism regarding the industrys potential and underscored the urgency of advancing Sri Lankas progression towards a digital future.",

        "date": "October 26, 2023 07:35 pm",
        "content": "The Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) on Thursday (26 Oct.) introduced Regulated Short Selling (RSS) through Stock Borrowing and Lending (SBL) to enhance trading opportunities, marking a groundbreaking development in the Sri Lankan stock market. Issuing a press release in this regard, CSE noted that the initiative aims to promote market efficiency, liquidity, and investor confidence while fostering economic growth, aligning with international standards and practices. The SBL mechanism connects lenders and borrowers of shares for a predetermined period, allowing them to capitalize on market trends as in prevailing interest rates, allowing only eligible securities specified by the CSE to partake in trading. The eligibility of these securities will also be reviewed by the CSE on a quarterly basis, they further said. All investors who maintain Central Depository System (CDS) accounts will now have the privilege of engaging in SBL transactions as lenders and borrowers via the CDS through their respective trading participants and custodian banks (CDS participants). CDS participants are empowered to act as intermediaries for SBL transactions. Investors can seamlessly carry out SBL transactions by submitting the lendingborrowing orders using the participant pool account or by submitting orders directly to the CDS through their participants, the press release further read. The SBL mechanism also offers a unique opportunity for lenders to leverage a portion of their portfolio that may not be actively used for regular trading, while simultaneously earning an additional fee-based income. On the other hand, borrowers, too, can leverage the potential of price movements in a declining market, amplifying their gains. CSE is also introducing RSS, with checks and balances designed to address risk management and market stability in the short selling practices, allowing for only the shares of specific listed companies meeting liquidity criteria to be deemed eligible. Further, RSS can only be carried out through the Automated Trading System (ATS), using the services of a trading participant, and will not be permitted for orders submitted by clients via internet, the CSE explained. A key feature of RSS is the Uptick Rule, which will come into effect when the price of a share eligible for RSS declines by 10 from its previous closing price. In such instance, the system will validate short sale orders based on the Uptick Rule. Under the Uptick Rule, a short sell order must be at least one tick size above the last traded price of the share, ensuring that short sales are executed at a price higher than the most recent trade. The Uptick Rule prevents short selling at excessively low prices, reducing potential market manipulation and volatility. If a shares price depreciates by 20, RSS for that particular share will not be permitted until the price appreciates above the designated threshold, the relevant release read in this regard. Commenting on the initiative, CSE Chairman Dilshan Wirasekara said, The introduction of regulated short selling through stock borrowing and lending is a testament to our commitment to fostering a dynamic and resilient financial market ecosystem here in Sri Lanka. This new initiative not only enhances our markets attractiveness to both local and international investors but also reinforces our position as a progressive exchange.",

        "date": "October 26, 2023 08:15 pm",
        "content": "In a bid to expand supply capacity and broaden market access, the government of Sri Lanka has decided to actively deepen its integration with South Asia, South East Asia and East Asia. This multifaceted growth strategy aims to propel the nation towards economic recovery, the Presidents Media Division (PMD) said, adding that as part of this endeavour, Sri Lanka is not only looking to strengthen its ties with its largest traditional export destinations, namely the USA and the EUUK, but also actively with regions within South Asia, South East Asia and East Asia. One significant aspect of this economic strategy involves the negotiation and execution of bilateral trade agreements. Currently, Sri Lanka has bilateral trade agreements in place with key South Asian partners, including India (India Sri Lanka Free Trade Agreement  ISLFTA) and Pakistan (Pakistan Sri Lanka Free Trade Agreement  PSFTA), with a primary focus on trade in goods. Additionally, Sri Lanka enjoys access to South Asian markets through regional trading agreements, such as the South Asian Free Trade Area (SAFTA) and the SAARC Preferential Trading Arrangement (SAPTA). Notably, Sri Lanka is actively engaged in Preferential Trade Agreement (PTA) negotiations with Bangladesh, with a strong emphasis on trade in goods. These negotiations, initiated in June 2021, have already seen three rounds of discussions. Given Sri Lankas positive trade balance with Bangladesh, establishing a PTA is seen as a pivotal move to further enhance bilateral trade, beyond the existing agreements in place. The next step involves both countries exchanging their initial offer lists in preparation for subsequent rounds of negotiations, the PMD reported. Furthermore, Sri Lanka is set to enter its 12th round of negotiations on the proposed Economic and Technology Cooperation Agreement (ETCA) with India. This comprehensive agreement has a broader scope than the current ISLFTA, underscoring the deepening economic ties between the two nations. Sri Lankas engagement with ASEAN countries is on the rise through Free Trade Agreements. The country has already entered into a comprehensive Free Trade Agreement with Singapore (Sri Lanka Singapore Free Trade Agreement  SLSFTA) in January 2018, which came into force in May of the same year. Ongoing negotiations are taking place with other ASEAN countries, including Thailand and Indonesia, with the goal of expanding trade cooperation across various sectors. Sri Lanka is also in discussions with China to resume negotiations for a proposed FTA. So far, six rounds of negotiations have been concluded, aiming to gain market access for selected Sri Lankan products in China and establish links to global value chains. Additionally, Sri Lanka is making strides toward establishing an economic integration program with ASEAN, Oceania and East Asia by joining the worlds largest Free Trade Agreement, the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) Agreement. The government has already submitted its Letter of Intention to join the RCEP, underscoring its commitment to global economic integration. All these trade agreement negotiations are under the purview of the Cabinet appointed National Trade Negotiation Committee (NTNC). Led by the Chief Negotiator of the Office of International Trade under the Presidential Secretariat, this committee includes senior-level officers from various government departments and institutions. The NTNC is further supported by eleven subcommittees representing relevant ministries and departments, facilitating negotiations and stakeholder engagements. These comprehensive trade initiatives are integral to Sri Lankas vision of transforming into a developed economy by 2048, aligning with the governments overarching goals for economic growth and prosperity.",

        "content": "State Minister for Urban Development and Housing, Arundika Fernando, announced the commencement of five housing projects in the Colombo city aimed at benefiting the low and middle-class population. Speaking at a news conference held at the Presidential Media Centre (PMC) this afternoon (26 Oct.) under the theme Collective Path to a Stable Country, State Minister Fernando highlighted that President Ranil Wickremesinghe has recently secured an agreement with the Chinese Government. Fernando also emphasized that housing projects initiated by the Housing Development Authority, currently on hold, will be reinitiated as part of the new budget for the year 2024. Expressing his views further he said; Our nation is a stunning island that boasts diverse topography, various climate zones and an abundance of natural resources. Notably, our country is rich in valuable mineral resources and is among the regions with the lowest occurrence of natural disasters globally. Land stands as our most precious resource and its value escalates with the growing population. Even in suburban areas, land values continue to rise. The Urban Development Authority manages a substantial amount of land, but the available information about these lands is currently insufficient. Consequently, the ministry is actively working to enhance data on land ownership. Moreover, the Urban Development Authority has acquired lands for various government projects, encompassing activities like urban planning and city expansion. We also possess land suitable for both domestic and foreign investments, providing opportunities for interested parties to utilize government-owned land. Once the Urban Development Authoritys data is fully digitized, anyone can access information about the lands owned by the authority. A strong emphasis has been placed on utilizing our land resources for economic gain, exemplified by valuable plots like those on McCallum Road. These principles apply not only to Colombo but to all cities, including Kandy, Bogambara Prison and Nuwara Eliya. Additionally, there are plans to create new investment opportunities cantered around the Bogambara prison land. Thanks to the effective financial management under President Ranil Wickremesinghes leadership, theres potential to revive halted projects initiated by the Housing Development Authority. We anticipate resuming these activities with the new budget for 2024. Furthermore, instances of fraud and corruption have marred certain projects. The ministry is actively taking measures to rectify these errors. In addition, there are plans to initiate five housing projects in Colombo, targeting individuals with low and moderate incomes. This substantial undertaking is estimated to cost 350 million dollars, with a significant commitment from the Chinese Government, secured through President Ranil Wickremesinghe. To date, 200 million US dollars have already been received for this ambitious project, which aims to construct 2,500 houses. Simultaneously, the Lowland Development Authority is playing a significant role in flood control efforts within Colombo. Initiatives are also underway to safeguard mangroves and wetlands. Unfortunately, some individuals who had their lands requisitioned for flood control purposes have faced challenges, including inadequate compensation. Our aim is to rectify this situation and acquire these lands in a more systematic manner within Colombo city. As a ministry, we stand prepared to make the utmost contribution to President Ranil Wickremesinghes mission for the countrys development.",

        "content": "Chinas former Premier Li Keqiang died of a heart attack on Friday, just 10 months after retiring from a decade in office during which his reformist star had dimmed. He was 68. Once viewed as a top Communist Party leadership contender, Li was sidelined in recent years by President Xi Jinping, who tightened his grip on power and steered the worlds second-largest economy in a more statist direction. The elite economist supported a more open market economy, advocating for supply-side reforms in an approach dubbed Likonomics - which was never fully implemented. Ultimately, he had to bend to Xis preference for more state control and his former power base waned in influence as Xi installed his own acolytes to powerful positions. Comrade Li Keqiang, while resting in Shanghai in recent days, experienced a sudden heart attack on Oct. 26 and after all-out efforts to revive him failed, died in Shanghai at ten minutes past midnight on Oct. 27, state broadcaster CCTV reported. Chinese social media experienced an outpouring of grief and shock, with some government websites turning black-and-white in an official sign of mourning. The Weibo microblogging platform turned its like button into a mourn icon in the shape of a chrysanthemum flower. Li was premier and head of Chinas cabinet under Xi for a decade until stepping down from all political positions in March. Laying a wreath in August 2022 at a statue of Deng Xiaoping - the leader who brought transformational reform to Chinas economy - Li vowed: Reform and opening up will not stop. The Yangtze and Yellow River will not reverse course. Video clips of the speech, which went viral but were later censored from Chinese social media, were widely viewed as a coded criticism of Xis policies. Li sparked debate on poverty and income inequality in 2020, saying 600 million people in China earned less than the equivalent of 140 per month. END OF AN ERA Some Chinese intellectuals and members of the liberal elite expressed shock and dismay on a semi-private WeChat channel at the passing of a beacon of Chinas liberal economic reform, with some saying it signalled the end of an era. Li will probably be remembered as an advocate for the freer market and for the have-nots, said Wen-Ti Sung, a political scientist at Australian National University. But most of all, he will be remembered for what could have been. Alfred Wu, associate professor at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy in Singapore, said, All these types of people no longer exist anymore in Chinese politics. Li was less influential than his immediate predecessors as premier, Zhu Rongji and Wen Jiabao, Wu said. He was sidelined but what more could he have done? It was very hard for him, with the constraints he faced under Xi. Adam Ni, an independent China political analyst, described Li as a premier who stood powerless as China took a sharp turn away from reform and opening. Some social media users mentioned a song called Sorry it wasnt you, a veiled reference to Xi. The song went viral around the death of former President Jiang Zemin in November last year before being censored. Xi will likely respect party tradition and lead public mourning for Li, as he has no reason to anger Lis colleagues and supporters in the party, whose waning political influence is further weakened by his death, said Neil Thomas, fellow for Chinese politics at the Asia Society Policy Institutes Center for China Analysis. Li was born in Anhui province in eastern China, a poor farming area where his father was an official and where he was sent to toil in the fields during the Cultural Revolution. While studying law at the prestigious Peking University, Li befriended ardent pro-democracy advocates, some of whom would become outright challengers to party control. The confident English speaker was immersed in the intellectual and political ferment of the decade of reform under Deng. That period ended in the 1989 pro-democracy Tiananmen Square protests that the military crushed. After graduation, he joined the Communist Partys Youth League, then a reformist-tinged ladder to higher office. He rose in the Youth League while completing a masters degree in law and then an economics doctorate under Professor Li Yining, a well-known advocate of market reforms. His political experience as a provincial leader in Henan, a poor and restless rural belt of central China, was marred by accusation of cracking down after an AIDS scandal. He also served as party chief of Liaoning, a rustbelt province striving to attract investment and reinvent itself as a modern industrial heartland. Lis patron was Hu Jintao, a former president from a political faction loosely based around the Youth League. After Xi took over as party chief in 2012, he took steps to break up the Youth League faction. Li is survived by his wife Cheng Hong, an English professor at the Capital University of Economics and Business, and their daughter. Source: Reuters -Agencies",

        "date": "October 27, 2023 10:59 am",
        "content": "The Committee on Public Enterprises (COPE) has instructed the State Mortgage  Investment Bank (SMIB) to take required measures to overcome its administrative weaknesses and to be a competitive bank without completely deviating from its core objectives. These recommendations were given when the officials of the Finance Ministry and the State Mortgage  Investment Bank were summoned before the COPE last week. COPE chair MP Prof. Ranjith Bandara and the committee members have examined the banks audit report for the years 2020 and 2021 and looked into its current performance. Attention was drawn to the delay in establishing a new core banking system as per the recommendations given in the previous COPE meeting. The SMIB officials, assuring that these works are in progress, promised to complete them by July 2024. The committee emphasized the need to improve the operations at the commercial level to increase the assets of the bank and reach an advanced level. The COPE chair pointed out the importance of being close to the public as a competitive bank without completely deviating from the banks core objectives. Accordingly, the need to establish the banks brand among the public innovatively and attractively (rebranding) was emphasized. Attention was also paid to recovering the loss of Rs. 68 million incurred by the SMIB in 2017 after some people obtained loans by submitting false documents. It was also revealed that this fraud was a result of giving the relevant loan amount to 49 loan applicants with the help of some officials of the bank. Officials stated that Rs. 8 million has already been recovered in line with legal proceedings adding that legal measures have been initiated to obtain the remaining amount. The COPE highlighted that, although 6 years have elapsed since this incident, punishing the officials involved and recovering the lost money were delayed. Accordingly, the SMIB officials were instructed to submit a report on this within two weeks. Additionally, attention was drawn to the fact that 10 branches have recorded a high non-performing loan rate, exceeding the average value of the non-performing loan rate of the SMIB. The officers pointed out that since the majority of the customers of this bank are middle- and low-income earners, they had to be given grace periods to pay their debts due to the prevailing economic situation. Accordingly, the COPE gave instructions to take necessary steps in this regard.",

        "date": "October 27, 2023 04:05 pm",
        "content": "Two U.S. fighter jets struck weapons and ammunition facilities in Syria on Friday in retaliation for attacks on U.S. forces by Iranian-backed militia as concerns grew that the Israel-Hamas conflict may spread in the Middle East. U.S. President Joe Biden ordered strikes on the two facilities used by Irans Revolutionary Guard Corps and militia groups that it backs, the Pentagon said, warning the U.S. will take additional measures if attacks by Irans proxies continue. U.S. and coalition troops have been attacked at least 19 times in Iraq and in Syria by Iran-backed forces in the past week. Hamas, Islamic Jihad and Lebanons Hezbollah are all backed by Tehran. Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian said at the United Nations on Thursday that if Israels offensive against Hamas did not stop, the United States will not be spared from this fire. The U.S. air strikes took place at roughly 4:30 a.m. on Friday (0130 GMT) near Abu Kamal, a Syrian town on the border with Iraq, and were carried out by two F-16 fighter jets using precision munitions, a U.S. defence official said. These precision self-defence strikes are a response to a series of ongoing and mostly unsuccessful attacks against U.S. personnel in Iraq and Syria by Iranian-backed militia groups that began on October 17, U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said in a statement. These Iranian-backed attacks against U.S. forces are unacceptable and must stop, Austin said. Biden has sent a rare message to Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei warning Tehran against targeting U.S. personnel in the Middle East, the White House said earlier on Thursday. What we want is for Iran to take very specific actions, to direct its militias and proxies to stand down, a senior U.S. defence official said. The United States did not coordinate the air strikes with Israel, the official added. The United States has sent warships and fighter aircraft to the region over the last three weeks. On Thursday the Pentagon said about 900 more U.S. troops have arrived in the Middle East or are heading there to bolster air defences for U.S. personnel. Israel said on Friday military raids into Gaza were preparing the next stage of the operation, amid fears that a ground invasion of the Palestinian enclave could spark a wider Middle East conflict. Israel has bombarded the densely populated Gaza Strip following the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Israeli communities. Israel says Hamas killed some 1,400 people including children, and took more than 200 hostages, some of them infants and older adults. The Hamas-controlled Gaza health ministry said on Thursday that 7,028 Palestinians had been killed in the retaliatory air strikes, including 2,913 children. Reuters could not independently verify the tolls. A missile launched as part of fighting between Hamas and Israel struck an Egyptian resort town about 220 km (135 miles) from the Gaza Strip early on Friday, Egypts Al Qahera News reported, citing sources. The missile hit a medical facility in Taba, injuring at least six people, Al Qahera reported. A witness in Taba confirmed hearing an explosion and seeing smoke rising, but Reuters was not immediately able to identify the blasts source. ISRAEL SAYS HITS HAMAS COMMANDERS Israel said on Friday that its fighter jets had struck three senior Hamas operatives who played significant roles in the Oct. 7 attack on Israel. They were commanders in the Daraj Tuffah Battalion, part of the Gaza City Brigade, Israel said. There was no official announcement by Hamas. Palestinian militants clashed with Israeli troops in at least two areas of the Gaza Strip on Friday, Hamas-affiliated media reported. Reuters was unable to immediately confirm the reports. As the plight of Palestinian civilians grows more desperate, the issue of whether to have humanitarian pauses or ceasefire agreements in the Hamas-run coastal enclave will come before the 193-member U.N. General Assembly on Friday in a draft resolution submitted by Arab states calling for a ceasefire. Unlike in the Security Council where resolutions on Gaza aid failed this week, no country holds a veto in the General Assembly. Resolutions are non-binding, but carry political weight. More than 613,000 people were estimated to have been made homeless by the Israeli bombardment of Gaza and were being sheltered by the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA. ISRAELIS SUPPORT FOR GROUND INVASION DIPS, POLL Almost half of Israelis want to hold off on any invasion of Gaza, according to a poll published on Friday. Asked if the military should immediately escalate to a large-scale ground offensive, 29 of Israelis agreed while 49 said it would be better to wait and 22 were undecided, the poll published in the Maariv newspaper said. The daily said the results contrasted with its Oct. 19 poll that found 65 support for a major ground offensive. Maariv said it is almost certain that the developments on the matter of the hostages, which is now topping the agenda, have had a great impact on this shift (in opinion). Hamas freed four hostages over the last week amid efforts by regional mediator countries to arrange a larger-scale release. Hamas says around 50 hostages have been killed in Israeli strikes on Gaza.

        "title": "Israel expects long ground war in Gaza to destroy Hamas and its many tunnels",
        "date": "October 27, 2023 07:20 pm",
        "content": "Israel expects to launch a long and difficult ground offensive into Gaza soon to destroy Hamas, the countrys defense minister said Friday, describing a campaign that will require destroying a vast network of tunnels used by the territorys militant rulers. Defense Minister Yoav Gallant spoke to a small group of foreign reporters in Tel Aviv after Israeli forces backed by fighter jets and drones carried out a second, limited ground raid into Gaza in as many days, striking the outskirts of Gaza City. Gallant said the ground invasion that follows weeks of airstrikes will take a long time, and that it would lead to another phase of lower-intensity fighting, as Israel destroys pockets of resistance. In a sign of rising tensions in the region, U.S. warplanes struck targets in eastern Syria that the Pentagon said were linked to Irans Revolutionary Guard after a string of attacks on American forces, and two mysterious objects hit towns in Egypts Sinai Peninsula. After three weeks of war, the Palestinian death toll has soared past 7,300, according to officials in Gaza, as Israel has carried out waves of devastating airstrikes in response to a bloody Hamas incursion into southern Israel on Oct. 7. More than 1,400 people were slain in Israel during Hamas attack, according to the Israeli government, and at least 229 hostages were taken into Gaza. Palestinian militants have fired thousands of rockets into Israel, including one that hit a residential building in Tel Aviv on Friday, wounding four people. The overall number of deaths far exceeds the combined toll of all four previous wars between Israel and Hamas, estimated at around 4,000. A ground invasion is expected to cause even higher casualties on both sides as Israeli forces and Hamas battle each other in dense residential areas. Hospitals have been scrounging for fuel to run emergency generators that power incubators and other life-saving equipment after Israel cut off all fuel deliveries to Gaza at the start of the war, forcing its only power plant to shut down. Only a trickle of food and medicine have been allowed in since the war began. Gallant said Israel believes that Hamas would confiscate any fuel that enters. He said Hamas uses generators to pump air into its hundreds of kilometers (miles) of tunnels, which originate in civilian areas. He showed reporters aerial footage of what he said was a tunnel shaft built right next to a hospital. For air, they need oil. For oil, they need us, he said. Little is known about Hamas secretive tunnels and other infrastructure, and it wasnt possible to independently confirm Gallants claims. Lynne Hastings, the U.N. aid coordinator for the Palestinian territories, declined to comment on Gallants remarks, saying we dont know what Hamas has or doesnt have. We have been bringing fuel into Gaza in coordination with the government of Israel for decades. We know fuel is a high-risk item and are working with the Israelis to make sure what we will be using for our operations is done securely, she said. The U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, which provides basic services to hundreds of thousands of people in Gaza, said it has been forced to ration fuel among lifesaving machines in hospitals, bakeries, and desalinisation plants, and only has enough for a few more days. The siege means that food, water and fuel  basic commodities  are being used to collectively punish more than 2 million people, among them, a majority of children and women, Philippe Lazzarini, the head of UNRWA, told reporters. Earlier on Friday, the military said ground forces raided inside Gaza, striking dozens of militant targets over the past 24 hours. It said aircraft and artillery bombed targets in Shijaiyah, a neighborhood on Gaza Citys outskirts that was the scene of an urban battle in the 2014 Gaza war. The military said the soldiers exited the territory without suffering any casualties. It reported an earlier, hourslong raid into northern Gaza on Thursday. The damage to Gaza from nearly three weeks of bombardment showed in satellite photos of several locations taken before the war and again in recent days. Entire rows of residential buildings simply disappear in the photos, reduced to smears of dust and rubble. A complex of 13 high-rises by the sea was pounded to dust near Gaza Citys al-Shati refugee camp, leaving only a few tottering bits of facade, according to the photos by Maxar Technologies. After U.S. President Joe Biden cast doubt on the accuracy of Gazas death tolls, the territorys Health Ministry on Thursday released a detailed list of names and identification numbers of those killed. The toll includes more than 3,000 minors and more than 1,500 women. The Israeli military says it only targets militants and accuses Hamas of operating among civilians in an attempt to protect its fighters. Palestinian militants have fired thousands of rockets into Israel, including one that hit a residential building in Tel Aviv on Friday, wounding three people. The conflict has threatened to ignite a wider war across the region. U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said that the strikes in eastern Syria were a response to ongoing and mostly unsuccessful attacks against U.S. personnel in Iraq and Syria over the past 10 days. He said the operation was separate from the Israel-Hamas war. Iran-backed fighters later fired rockets at an oil facility housing U.S. troops in eastern Syria, according to Syrian opposition activists. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the U.S. strikes had wounded seven Iran-backed Iraqi fighters. Hezbollah, an Iranian-backed ally of Hamas in Lebanon, has repeatedly traded fire with Israel along the border, and Israel has carried out airstrikes targeting Iran-linked groups in Syria. The United States has sent two aircraft carrier strike groups to the region, along with additional fighter jets and other weaponry and personnel, in part to deter Iran and its allies from entering the war on the side of Hamas. Egypts military meanwhile said a drone crashed into a building in the Red Sea town of Taba, on the border with Israel, slightly wounding six people. In a separate incident, the state-run Al-Qahera news said a strange object landed near a power station in the Red Sea town of Nuweiba, further south. Footage showed debris and smoke rising from the side of a nearby mountain. Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, an Israeli military spokesperson, said an aerial threat was identified in the area of the Red Sea, which appeared to be the source of the Taba incident. He said fighter jets were dispatched to the area and that Israel, Egypt and the U.S. were tightening their defenses in the region. Last week, a U.S. Navy destroyer in the northern Red Sea shot down three cruise missiles and several drones launched toward Israel by Iran-backed Houthi rebels in northern Yemen. About 1.4 million of Gazas 2.3 million residents have fled their homes, with nearly half of them crowding into U.N. shelters. Hundreds of thousands remain in northern Gaza, despite Israel ordering them to evacuate to the south and saying that those who remain might be considered accomplices of Hamas. Over the past week, Israel has allowed more than 80 trucks with aid enter from Egypt through the Rafah crossing, the only entry point into Gaza not controlled by Israel. But aid workers say the convoys meet only a tiny fraction of the territorys mounting humanitarian needs. Before the war, an average of 500 trucks entered Gaza each day, according to the United Nations. The Palestinian Red Crescent said on social media that it had received 10 trucks of food, medicine and other supplies had passed through Rafah on Friday morning. The U.S. has been working with other mediators to send in more humanitarian aid, but Israel is insisting on strict screening procedures for all trucks that enter. Washington says Hamas has refused to open the Gaza side of the Rafah crossing to let hundreds of foreign passport holders leave. Source - AP News - Agencies",

        "date": "October 27, 2023 07:30 pm",
        "content": "The Governor of the Eastern Province, Senthil Thondaman has emphasised that land distribution in the Eastern Province is conducted in full accordance with legal procedures by the Ministry of Mahaweli, and remains free from any ethnic or religious biases. Speaking at a press conference held at the Presidential Media Centre (PMC) on Friday (27 Oct.), Thondaman also warned that any attempts to disrupt the land distribution activities within the Eastern Province will result in legal action taken by the Police. The Governor further emphasised that steadfast commitment is maintained to upholding the law as a unified Sri Lankan nation, with a resolute focus on the well-being of all ethnic groups. Further elaborating on the matter, Thondaman said: In the years following the end of the war, residents of the Mailattamadu  Divulapatana area in the Eastern Province have gradually begun to resettle in those areas. Consequently, arrangements have been made to allocate relevant land for agricultural and dairy farming. A significant number of individuals from Polonnaruwa and Ampara areas were relocated during the resettlement in the Mailattamadu area. President Ranil Wickremesinghe has also instructed the provision of temporary incentives to farmers from other districts who have come to protect their agricultural activities. Furthermore, the residents of Ampara and Polonnaruwa areas are actively considering early settlement in these areas. The legal resettlement of individuals who lived in the Mailattamadu  Divulapathana area before the war is being carried out at the directive of the President, under the Ministry of Mahaweli. Additionally, unauthorized occupants of government lands are being legally processed for settlement on government lands. It is essential to underscore that the relocation of Tamil people from the eastern Koralaipattu area and Muslim people from the Navaladi area for the Mahaweli initiative is devoid of ethnic or religious basis. All these activities adhere to legal procedures and rely on data provided by the Grama Niladari. In consideration of all these factors, a steadfast commitment is maintained to upholding the law as a unified Sri Lankan nation, with a resolute focus on the well-being of all ethnic groups. Consequently, it is respectfully urged that external viewpoints, not directly involved, are refrained from in regard to land releases in the Eastern Province",

        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe has urged all politicians and citizens to set their sights on a new vision for the nation, emphasizing the need to build a new country, a fresh economy and a reinvigorated political system, united for the common good. The Head of State made this solemn call to all politicians and citizens alike acknowledging the inherent political differences in a multi-party democracy. These remarks were made during the event held at the Royal College in Colombo on Friday (Oct. 27) to mark a century of educational excellence at Reid Avenue, the Presidents Media Division (PMD) said. During his speech, the President also lauded the remarkable quality of education provided by Sri Lankas schools, with a special mention of institutions like Royal College. He stressed that the A-level curriculum in Sri Lanka is renowned for its rigor and its special emphasis on nurturing exceptional students while maintaining a high standard of academic excellence. President Wickremesinghe underscored the significance of the current moment, describing it as a turning point where the old order is facing a crisis. He firmly stated that returning to the ways of the past in economics, education and politics is not an option. Instead, he called for a collective effort to forge a new future for the nation, a country that aligns with the aspirations of its citizens. The PMD said the Presidents words resonated with history, as he traced the journey of Royal College from its early days. He has highlighted that Royal College, along with many other renowned institutions, has been instrumental in producing leaders and scholars who have contributed significantly to the development of Sri Lanka. As the Head of State concluded his speech, he emphasized the importance of not only commemorating a century-old building but also celebrating the traditions, values and contributions that have been integral to Royal College. He urged the students and citizens to look toward the future, recognizing the evolving landscape of education and the changing world. President Wickremesinghe hinted at forthcoming changes in education and urged a paradigm shift in the management of schools to meet the challenges of the modern world. He stressed the need to adapt to new technologies and sciences, especially in addressing pressing global issues like climate change.",

        "title": "UN General Assembly adopts resolution calling for immediate humanitarian truce in Gaza",
        "date": "October 28, 2023 07:20 am",
        "content": "The U.N. General Assembly approved a nonbinding resolution Friday calling for a humanitarian truce in Gaza leading to a cessation of hostilities between Israel and Gazas Hamas rulers, the first United Nations response to the war. The 193-member world body adopted the resolution by a vote of 120-14 with 45 abstentions after rejecting a Canadian amendment backed by the United States. It would have unequivocally condemned the Oct. 7 terrorist attacks by Hamas and demanded the immediate release of hostages taken by Hamas, which is not mentioned in the Arab-drafted resolution. Riyad Mansour, the Palestinian U.N. ambassador, called the General Assembly more courageous, more principled than the divided U.N. Security Council, which failed in four attempts during the past two weeks to reach agreement on a resolution. Two were vetoed and two failed to get the minimum nine yes votes required for approval. Israels U.N. Ambassador Gilad Erdan called it a day that will go down in infamy, saying after the vote: Israel will not stop the operation until Hamas terror capabilities are destroyed and our hostages are returned.  And the only way to destroy Hamas is root them out of their tunnels and subterranean city of terror. Frustrated Arab nations went to the General Assembly, where there are no vetoes, to press for a U.N. response, and United Arab Emirates Ambassador Lana Nusseibeh, the Arab representative on the Security Council, expressed delight at the result. 120 votes in this kind of geopolitical environment is a very, very high signal of the support for international law, for proportionate use of force, and it is a rejection of the status quo that is currently happening on the ground, she said. The 14 countries that voted against the resolution include Israel and its closest ally, the United States, five Pacific island nations and just four European countries  Austria, Croatia, Czechia and Hungary. Most European countries voted yes or abstained. Mansour said the European votes indicate they can be very helpful in pursuing a Security Council resolution or in maximizing pressure in Israel to stop this war. While the surprise Hamas attacks killed some 1,400 Israelis, more than 7,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israels retaliatory airstrikes, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. The escalating death toll and destruction in Gaza has heightened international support for humanitarian truces to get desperately needed food, water, medicine and fuel to the 2.3 million people in Gaza. Unlike Security Council resolutions, General Assembly resolutions are not legally binding but the UAEs Nusseibeh told reporters they carry incredible weight and moral authority. She said the 10 elected Security Council members, who serve two-year terms, will take the moral authority from the General Assembly and try to break the gridlock on a council resolution. -The votes came part way through a list of 113 speakers at an emergency special session of the General Assembly on Israeli actions in occupied Palestinian territories. Jordans U.N. Ambassador Mahmoud Hmoud, speaking on behalf of the U.N.s 22-nation Arab group, called for action on the resolution because of the urgency of the escalating situation on the ground. Before the vote, Hmoud urged defeat of the Canadian amendment, saying Israel is responsible for the atrocities that are being committed now, and that will be committed in the ground invasion of Gaza. Canadas U.N. Ambassador Robert Rae countered that the resolution appears to forget that the events of Oct. 7 happened. The amendment would condemn Hamas, which is responsible for one of the worst terrorist attacks in history, he said. Pakistans U.N. Ambassador Munir Akran drew loud applause when he said the Arab-drafted resolution deliberately didnt condemn or mention Israel or name any other party. If Canada was really equitable, Akram said, it would agree either to name everybody  both sides who are guilty of having committed crimes  or it would not name either as we chose. The vote on the Canadian amendment was 88-55 with 23 abstentions, but it failed to get a two-thirds majority of all those voting. In the vote on the entire resolution that followed Canada abstained. The assemblys emergency special session, which began Wednesday, continued Friday morning with U.S. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield echoing Israels Erdan in calling the resolution outrageous for never mentioning Hamas and saying it is detrimental to the vision of a two-state solution. She called it a perilous moment for Israelis and Palestinians, stressing that there is no justification for Hamas terror, that Palestinians are being used as human shields and that the lives of innocent Palestinians must be protected. Oman, speaking on behalf of the Gulf Cooperation Council, condemned Israels siege of Gaza, starvation of its population and collective punishment of Palestinians. But it said the Palestinians wont be deterred from demanding their legitimate inalienable rights, chief among them the right to self- determination and the right to establish an independent Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital. In addition to calling for an immediate, durable and sustained humanitarian truce leading to a cessation of hostilities, the resolution adopted Friday demands that all parties immediately comply with their obligations under international humanitarian and human rights law requiring protection of civilians and the schools, hospitals and other infrastructure critical for their survival. The resolution demands that essential supplies be allowed into the Gaza Strip and humanitarian workers have sustained access. And it calls on Israel to rescind its order for Gazans to evacuate the north and move to the south and firmly rejects any attempts at the forced transfer of the Palestinian civilian population. The resolution also stresses the need to urgently establish a mechanism to ensure the protection of the Palestinian civilian population. And it emphasizes the importance of preventing further destabilization and escalation of violence in the region and calls on all parties to exercise maximum restraint and on all those with influence to press them to work toward this objective.

        "date": "October 28, 2023 09:50 am",
        "content": "Minister of Industry and Health, Dr. Ramesh Pathirana, stated that due to the limited availability of land for industrial purposes in Sri Lanka, the objective is to designate 1 of the island nations total land area for industrial use. He pointed out that there was a remarkable opportunity to achieve a historic record in the countrys export earnings, with the potential to reach USD 13.1 billion by the year 2022. Pathirana made these remarks during his participation in a press conference held at the Presidential Media Centre on Friday (Oct. 27), with the overarching theme of Collective Path to a Stable Country. Minister Ramesh Pathirana further said; Amid the recent dual challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic and economic crises, individuals across all sectors, from small enterprises to large corporations, devoted their collective efforts to enhance our countrys production. Their dedication deserves our sincere appreciation. Our nations entrepreneurs played a pivotal role in elevating both domestic production and exports, particularly during periods of import restrictions. As a result, there was a promising opportunity to achieve an unprecedented milestone by generating an export income of 13.1 billion dollars by 2022. Sri Lanka faces limitations in the available land for industrial purposes, hindering the growth of our industrial sector. To address this, measures are being taken to expand industrial land allocation, with a target of dedicating 1 of the nations total land area for industrial purposes. The National Policy for Industrial Development of Sri Lanka (NaPID) has been meticulously formulated and presented to the Cabinet. It has gained approval for inclusion in Sri Lankas National Policy Framework (2023-2048) by the Committee on Economic Stabilization Revitalization and Growth Enhancement. Furthermore, a comprehensive five-year strategic plan related to the industrial policy has been developed and its implementation is already underway within the ministry. The process of amending the Industrial Promotion Act No. 46 of 1990 to align with current and future requirements has reached its conclusion. The initial draft, along with recommendations from the Drafting Department, has been finalized. Additionally, the second draft related to the formulation of the national policy regarding automobile production, including assembly and manufacturing of automobile components, has been completed. This draft has been submitted to relevant stakeholders and after productive discussions; the national policy concerning vehicle assembly is nearing its finalization. Committees appointed to review the initial draft of the E-Vehicle Guideline have provided valuable suggestions. Taking these recommendations into account, work on the revised guidelines has commenced and is expected to conclude shortly. Furthermore, approval has been granted for the establishment of 15 new institutions associated with car assembly and car parts production in 2023. As part of the special national program for creating industrial zones and industries at the regional and district levels, essential development activities are underway at identified regional industrial estates that can be swiftly completed. This initiative encompasses 32 existing industrial estates and the creation of 6 new ones in Aluthapola, Dambulla, Sandamalgama, Suriyawewa, Mahawa and Wellawaya. Additionally, plans are in place to establish a 100-acre industrial park in the Katunayake Katana area, equipped with necessary facilities for electric vehicle assembly and accessory production. Furthermore, three new industrial posts are in the process of being established, including Milleniya in the Kalutara district, Elpitiya in the Galle district and Poththapitiya in the Kandy district. A new sales method has been introduced for the sale of mineral sand by the Ceylon Mineral Sand Company. Bidders now have the option to submit their prices online, with the potential for the most suitable bidders information to be publicly disclosed concurrently with the opening of bids. The initial sale using this method resulted in the successful sale of 62,150 metric tons of mineral sand, generating revenue of 20.33 million dollars. Subsequently, the second sale yielded a revenue of USD 14.1 million for 30,000 MT of zircon and a portion of this income, Rs. 1726 million has been allocated to the Treasury as dividends.",

        "date": "October 28, 2023 10:38 am",
        "content": "A man suspected of killing 18 people in a shooting in Maine has been found dead after a three-day manhunt, US police say. Robert Card, 40, was found dead from an apparently self-inflicted gunshot wound, Maine Commissioner of Public Safety Michael Sauschuck said. The news comes hours after police lifted a stay-at-home order for the normally quiet community. Among the dead are a grandfather, a talented young bowler, and four deaf locals, ranging in age from 14 to 76. The suspect in Wednesday nights shootings has been located and is deceased, the Androscoggin County Sheriffs Office said on Facebook. At a news conference at Lewiston City Hall, Maine Governor Janet Mills said the body was found in Lisbon, near where the shooting occurred. Im breathing a sigh of relief tonight knowing that Robert Card will not be a threat to anyone, she said. Gov Mills said the discovery of the suspects body would set the community on the long and difficult road to healing. Lewiston Police Chief David St Pierre added that he was elated by the news, but our work is not done here. Were gonna grieve for the families that lost loved ones, were gonna continue to work, were gonna persevere and were gonna become better people for it, he continued. Commissioner Sauschuck said the body was found at 19:45 local time (23:45 GMT) on Friday near a river in Lisbon Falls. He said many of the details were being withheld because authorities wanted to speak to the victims families first. Another news conference is scheduled for 10:00 (14:00 GMT) on Saturday. Earlier on Friday, police released the names of all the 18 victims. Maine Senator Susan Collins said the state now can breathe a collective sigh of relief thanks to the brave first responders who worked night and day to find this killer. She added that President Joe Biden had called her earlier on Friday to tell her that the suspect had died. In a statement, Mr Biden said it had been a tragic two days - not just for Lewiston, Maine, but for our entire country. Once again, an American community and American families have been devastated by gun violence, he said. He called upon Republicans in Congress to fulfil their obligation to keep the American people safe by pushing for tighter gun controls. Until that day comes, I will continue to do everything in my power to end this gun violence epidemic, he added. The suspects sister-in-law had told NBC that the family was doing everything we can to help law enforcement. Our hearts are broken, said Katie Card, who is married to the gunmans brother. The attack happened on Wednesday night at a local bar and a bowling alley in the small town of Lewiston. Police responded to reports of shooting at two locations, a restaurant called Schemengees, and Just-In-Time Recreation, a bowling alley, which are about four miles (6.5km) apart. Seven people were killed at the bowling alley, eight at Schemengees Bar and Grille, and three were pronounced dead at local hospitals. On Friday night, before the news that Card had been found, members of the local deaf community, who were deeply affected by the tragedy, gathered over Zoom for a virtual vigil. Nearly 100 deaf and hard of hearing people from across the country joined. There are no words or signs to express what we are all experiencing, said moderator Terry Morrell, opening the event. We lost four beloved deaf people, he said, with two other deaf people injured. We are all grieving, we are all in shock, were angry, were numb, he said. Source: BBC -Agencies",

        "date": "October 28, 2023 12:22 pm",
        "content": "Minister of Sports  Youth Affairs, in a fresh letter to the International Cricket Council (ICC), has slammed the national cricket governing body and refuted the allegations of political interference. On Friday (Oct. 27), Roshan Ranasinghe wrote to ICCs chairman Greg Barclay and CEO Geoff Allardice, in response to the recent media reports claiming that Sri Lanka stands to lose opportunities to hold a few international cricket events due to specific actions of the sports minister, which were deemed detrimental to the operations of Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) and its ability to function autonomously. Ranasinghe emphasized that it is factually incorrect to say that he, in his capacity as the Sports Minister, had exerted political pressure on SLC. I view this as an extreme measure by the officials of Sri Lanka Cricket trying to prevent future legal and administrative actions against them for their financial misconduct, which is now published by the supreme and independent authority of auditing in Sri Lanka, the Government Audit Department. Ranasinghe said it is regrettable that the SLC officials were using the integrity and the good name of the ICC to shield their wrongdoing. The minister reiterated neither he nor the Sri Lankan government, under any circumstances, had any political interference in the national cricket governing body. He categorically rejected the allegation, saying it was baseless and fuelled by the corrupt officials of SLC. Additionally, Ranasinghe hit out at the current conduct of SLC officials, which he said was shameless, traitorous, and unfaithful to the cricket-loving community in the country. Recently published Auditor Generals report has made revelations regarding conflict-of-interest issues, transparency issues, fraud, corruption, excessive payments, abuse of authority, irregular transactions, irrelevant payments, evading procurement guidelines and many other misconducts on the part of the governing body of SLC, the minister said further in his letter.",

        "content": "Sri Lanka and France convened the inaugural bilateral consultations between the foreign ministries of the two countries at a senior official level earlier this week in Colombo. The consultations were part of the celebration of the 75th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between Sri Lanka and France, on October 27, 1948. Sri Lankan Foreign Ministry said consultations focussed on strengthening bilateral relations, supporting ongoing work on existing projects and initiatives, and identifying new areas of partnership and coordinated action between the two countries. The consultations reflected the desire expressed by President Ranil Wickremesinghe and President Emmanuel Macron during their meeting in Colombo on July 28, 2023, to strengthen the partnership between the two countries. The two parties reviewed progress in political relations; security; cultural cooperation and people-to-people contacts. They expressed their shared commitment to the values of freedom, democracy, human rights and the rule of law. The parties discussed the expansion of trade, investment, tourism and development cooperation between the two countries and between Sri Lanka and the EU, including the setting up of relevant modalities to facilitate economic cooperation between Sri Lanka and France. The parties committed to strengthening cooperation in the field of education by welcoming the support of France towards the teaching of the French language in Sri Lanka as well as strengthening cooperation between the two countries through academic and research exchanges between institutions of higher education. Sri Lanka appreciated the role played by France in bringing together the creditor platform under the aegis of the Paris Club in advancing the debt restructuring discussions.

They urged the government to roll back its attempts to destroy free education in the country by conspiring with private institutions, namely Lyceum Campus, NSBM Green University, Gateway Graduate School and the Kotelawala Defence University. They also accused the government of being involved in a conspiracy to further destroy Sri Lankas free healthcare system by imposing allowance cuts and urged that the issues faced by the medical faculties of the Universities of Moratuwa, Wayamba and Sabaragamuwa be resolved immediately.

        "date": "October 28, 2023 05:53 pm",
        "content": "Theres been intense Israeli bombardment of Gaza by air, heavier than in previous evenings, while all internet and phone communications appear to be out in the territory. Israel has confirmed its forces are expanding their ground operations. The internet monitoring service Netblocks posted on X, formerly known as Twitter, to say there had been a collapse in connectivity. The Palestinian Red Crescent says it cannot speak to its teams in Gaza. We are deeply concerned about the ability of our teams to continue providing their emergency medical services, especially since this disruption affects the central emergency number 101, they wrote in a post on X. Meanwhile sirens alerted people in southern Israel to rocket fire from Gaza. On Friday, the Israeli military again told Gaza City citizens to move south after announcing the expansion of its military operation. In a press conference, spokesman Daniel Hagari said the military had increased the attacks in Gaza. The air force widely attacks underground targets and terrorist infrastructure, very significantly. In continuation of the offensive activity we carried out in the last few days, the ground forces are expanding the ground activity this evening. Currently we cant get hold of people in Gaza with communicationns still down. For example the BBC tried to send a WhatsApp message at 6.40pm local (nearly three hours ago) - it still just has a single tick meaning it hasnt been received by the persons phone. Mobile phone call attempts just get an unobtainable message. Weve had the same for several other call attempts - messages and calls arent going through. BBC Arabic reporter Mehdi Musawi tried to reach journalists and health officials in Gaza all day and could only get short replies on WhatsApp. Eventually, they got through to Gazas Al Shifa hospital, but by evening all lines of communication were down. By then, live footage showed complete darkness across the region. The reporter sent messages to everyone he had spoken to earlier in the day - but they did not deliver. The panic and anxiety is spreading within the Palestinian diaspora. For the past 20 days, sporadic, limited exchanges on WhatsApp have brought occasional moments of respite. However, any extended gap in communication has been met with paralysing anxiety - marked by questions like: Are they dead, are they alive, was their house bombed too? In one WhatsApp group relatives from around the world have been frantically messaging since the blackout. Oh my god!! one wrote. It seems a ground offensive may start, wrote another. The near-total telecommunications blackout in Gaza risks providing cover for mass atrocities, Human Rights Watch said. This information blackout risks providing cover for mass atrocities and contributing to impunity for human rights violations, the groups senior technology and human rights researcher, Deborah Brown, said in a statement. The Palestinian telecoms provider Jawwal says there is a complete interruption of all communication and internet services with the Gaza strip in light of the ongoing aggression, which it says has cut the last of the international routes connecting Gaza to the outside world. Weve asked the Israeli military to comment on the communications outage but so far they have not responded. Source - BBC - Agencies",

The Ministers statement comes against the backdrop where a significant increase was seen in rice prices in the market. Local rice vendors claimed that they are no longer able to adhere to the MRP, and attributed the soaring rice prices to the increase in the price of paddy. However, responding to this increase in prices, Minister Fernando assured that constant raids will be carried out under his directives across the island so as to ensure that no additional burden is being placed on the people of the country by way of increased expenses. Thus, he further noted that in the event such raids are unable to control the increased rice prices, the relevant officials will be informed to take the required measures in order to import rice.",

Fernando and Nanayakkara had said they accepted ministerial portfolios in the government under President Gotabaya Rajapaksa to do their utmost to find solutions to the ongoing economic crisis as a positive response was not received from many political party leaders for a collective effort. They both subsequently resigned from their ministerial portfolios on July 9, 2022 along with the rest of the Cabinet, after then President Gotabaya Rajapaksa informed the Speaker of Parliament that he intends to resign.

        "date": "October 29, 2023 10:51 am",
        "content": "US actor Matthew Perry, best known for playing Chandler Bing in the hit 90s TV sitcom Friends, has died at the age of 54. The actor was found dead at his home in his Los Angeles, law enforcement sources told US media. Friends, which followed the fortunes of six young friends living in New York City, aired from 1994 until 2004. Its final episode was watched by 52.5 million in the US, making it the most watched TV episode of the 2000s. The LA Times and TMZ, which first reported that Perry had died, said the actor was found unresponsive in a hot tub at his house. A Los Angeles Fire Department spokesperson told the BBC that first responders went to an address in the Pacific Palisades area, regarding a water emergency of an unknown type, but did not name Perry. Warner Bros TV, which produced Friends, said we are devastated by the passing of our dear friend Matthew Perry. Matthew was an incredibly gifted actor and an indelible part of the Warner Bros. Television Group family, the statement read. The impact of his comedic genius was felt around the world, and his legacy will live on in the hearts of so many. This is a heartbreaking day, and we send our love to his family, his loved ones, and all of his devoted fans. Born in Massachusetts in 1969, Perry was raised in Ottawa, Canada, where he attended elementary school with Justin Trudeau, who later became Canadian prime minister. Perry moved to Los Angeles as a teenager. He starred as Chazz Russell in Boys Will Be Boys and also had roles in shows including Growing Pains. But he became an international star on Friends, a show which followed the lives of six New Yorkers navigating dating, careers and friendship. The comedy, co-starring Jennifer Aniston, Courteney Cox, David Schwimmer, Matt LeBlanc and Lisa Kudrow, became one of the most successful shows of all time. Perry was cast as the awkward Chandler Bing, famous for his sarcastic one-liners. The role earned him a Primetime Emmy nomination in 2002. Perry battled for years with addiction to painkillers and alcohol, and attended rehabilitation clinics on multiple occasions. In 2016, he told BBC Radio 2 that he could not remember three years of filming during Friends, because of drink and drugs. In an interview last year, he spoke about how he did not watch the show. I didnt watch the show, and havent watched the show, because I could go, Drinking, opiates, drinking, cocaine, he said. I could tell season by season, by how I looked. Thats why I dont wanna watch it, because thats what I see. But I think Im going to start to watch it because its been an incredible thing to watch it touch the hearts of different generations. Perry also appeared in several films, including Fools Rush In, Almost Heroes and the Whole Nine Yards. Maggie Wheeler, who played Janice in Friends, was the first of Perrys co-stars to publicly pay tribute to the actor. Ms Wheeler said the joy Perry brought to so many in his too short lifetime will live on. I feel so very blessed by every creative moment we shared, she wrote on Instagram. Cruel Intentions actress Selma Blair said Perry was her oldest boy friend, adding: All of us loved Matthew Perry, and I did especially. Every day. I loved him unconditionally. And he me. And Im broken. Broken hearted. Sweet dreams Matty. Sweet dreams. Source - BBC - Agencies",

        "content": "State Minister of Finance Shehan Semasinghe has assured that while the government will not take any decisions that would adversely affect the countrys economy, the reforms currently being implemented, in compliance with the agreement under the International Monetary Fund (IMF), are ones that should have been in place decades ago. Addressing the North Central Province Outstanding Entrepreneurs Awards Night held on Friday, the State Minister highlighted that the current reforms carried out by the government are reforms that should have been done two or three decades ago. Emphasising the fact that the government understands the added burden imposed on the people of Sri Lanka as part of the process of resolving the countrys economic crisis, the State Minister noted that it is every persons responsibility, including policy makers, to maintain the steadfast recovery Sri Lanka is currently experiencing. Speaking further with regards to the agreement Sri Lanka has with the IMF, Semasinghe stated that while countries such as India and South Korea have become economically powerful after receiving support from the IMF, Sri Lanka too, will have a strong economy following the full implementation of the reforms.",

        "title": "Israel wages ground campaign in Gaza, communications blackout slowly ending",
        "date": "October 29, 2023 04:25 pm",
        "content": "Israeli forces waged ground operations against Hamas in Gaza on Sunday in what Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called the second phase of a three-week-old war aimed at crushing the Palestinian militant group. However, telephone and internet communications in Gaza, largely severed late on Friday as Israels warplanes dropped bombs and its troops pushed into the Hamas-ruled enclave, were returning slowly on Sunday, Palestinian media outlets reported. The disruption of communications had impacted rescue operations, with people hit by the air strikes unable to call for help. Thousands of desperate Gaza residents broke into warehouses and distribution centres of the United Nations Palestinian refugee agency (UNRWA) grabbing flour and basic survival items, the organisation said on Sunday. Israel will allow a dramatic increase in aid to Gaza in the coming days and Palestinian civilians should head to a humanitarian zone in the south of the tiny territory, said Colonel Elad Goren of Cogat, the Israeli Defence Ministry agency that coordinates with the Palestinians. Netanyahu warned Israelis to expect a long and hard campaign but stopped short of calling the current incursions an invasion. Some of U.S. President Joe Bidens aides have advised Israeli counterparts to hold off on an immediate all-out assault, U.S. officials say. Even as initial ground operations appeared limited for now, Netanyahu pledged to spare no effort to free the more than 200 hostages, including foreigners, held by Hamas. This is the second stage of the war whose goals are clear - to destroy Hamas governing and military capabilities and to bring the hostages home, Netanyahu told a news conference on Saturday. We are only at the start, he said. We will destroy the enemy above ground and below ground. Israel has tightened its blockade and bombarded Gaza for three weeks since the Islamist group Hamas devastating Oct. 7 attack. At least 1,400 Israelis were killed in the deadliest day of the nations 75-year history, Israeli authorities said. Western countries have generally backed what they say is Israels right to self-defence. But there has been a mounting international outcry over the toll from the bombing and growing calls for a humanitarian pause to allow aid to reach Gaza civilians and ease the humanitarian crisis. Medical authorities in the Gaza Strip, which has a population of 2.3 million people, say 7,650 Palestinians have been killed in Israels campaign to obliterate the Iran-backed militants. WARNING The Palestinian Red Crescent said on Sunday it had received warnings from Israeli authorities to immediately evacuate al-Quds hospital in the Gaza Strip, adding that raids conducted on Sunday had taken place just 50 metres from the facility. An Israeli military spokesman declined to comment on the statement. Palestinian officials said around 50,000 people were taking shelter in the Gaza Shifa Hospital and said they were concerned about ongoing Israeli threats to the facility. With many buildings in Gaza reduced to rubble and shelter hard to find, residents are short of food, water, fuel and medicines. Commenting on the looting of flour and other staples in Gaza, UNRWA said in a statement: This is a worrying sign that civil order is starting to break down after three weeks of war and a tight siege on Gaza. God help anyone under the rubble, said one Gaza journalist, who spent a terrifying night in a building stairway as bombs fell and Israeli forces appeared to exchange fire with Palestinian fighters. Mahmoud Basal, a civil defence spokesman in Gaza, told Al Jazeera that voices could be heard under the rubble, and he appealed to Arab rescue teams for heavy machinery to help dig out survivors. Israel sent troops and tanks into Gaza on Friday night, focusing on infrastructure including the extensive tunnel network built by Hamas, the Israeli military said. It provided no details on the size of the deployment. Israels chief military spokesperson declined to say whether Israel had been behind the telecommunications blackout but said it would do what it needed to protect its forces. Netanyahu on Saturday reiterated Israels call for Palestinian civilians to evacuate the northern Gaza Strip where Israel was focusing its attack on what it was were Hamas hideouts and other installations. HUMANITARIAN CATASTROPHE But Palestinians say nowhere is safe, with bombs also smashing homes in the south of the densely populated territory. A humanitarian catastrophe is unfolding in front of our eyes, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said. The U.N. Security Council plans to meet on Monday on the Israel-Gaza crisis, diplomats said. Billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk offered his SpaceXs Starlink satellite network to support communications in Gaza for internationally recognised aid organisations. Israel responded that it would fight the move, saying Hamas would use it for terrorist activities. Netanyahu, who met hostages families on Saturday, said contacts to secure their release would continue even during a ground offensive and that military pressure on Hamas could help bring them home. He did not elaborate. Qatar-mediated negotiations between Israel and Hamas continued but at a much slower pace than before Fridays escalation in Gaza, a source briefed on the talks said. Hamas armed wing said its fighters battled Israeli troops in northeastern and central Gaza. Al-Qassam Brigades and all Palestinian resistance forces are fully prepared to confront the aggression with full force and thwart the incursions, it said. Source - Reuters - Agencies",

According to Instagram head Adam Mosseri, who announced it during a broadcast on the platform, the new feature lets users add an Add to post button in the bottom left corner of the carousel post. Once enabled, users can tap on the button to upload their favourite photos and videos to the post. However, the original account that posted the carousel must approve them before they are added. It is still unclear if Instagram will increase the current limit of 10 posts max and if each post will show who added the photo or video or if their names will be added like the existing collab posts feature. Instagram already offers a feature that lets users collaborate with other users on the platform. If you add your followers as a collaborator when creating a post, they will get an option to show that post on their profile as well. Since the start of the year, Instagram has been constantly adding new collaborative features like the ability to add music to carousels, join creators with an Add Yours sticker and the ability to save reels and photos with friends. Recently, a report by The Money Mongers suggests that Instagram is in the top list of invasive apps that collect and share user data with third-party services. The Meta-owned platform also recently came under heavy fire after 33 states including California and New York said that the social media platform repeatedly misled the public and harnessed powerful and unprecedented technologies to entice, engage, and ultimately ensnare youth and teens.

        "date": "October 29, 2023 08:32 pm",
        "content": "Sri Lanka has granted 48 hours for a Chinese vessel to conduct marine research off the islands west coast under supervision, the foreign ministry said on Sunday (29 Oct.), despite Indian concerns that it could be a spy ship. Ministry spokesperson Kapila Fonseka said Chinese research ship Shi Yan 6, which has been in Colombo since Wednesday, would be allowed to carry out work for two days starting Monday. Earlier, Sri Lanka allowed the vessel to enter the main port of Colombo only for replenishments over concerns raised by neighbouring India that the craft could be used to spy against them. New Delhi is suspicious of Chinas increasing presence in the Indian Ocean and its influence in Sri Lanka, which is strategically placed halfway along key east-west international shipping routes. A spacecraft-tracking Chinese vessel last year raised security concerns from India, and Sri Lanka prohibited it from undertaking any research activities while in its waters. Fonseka said local scientists will be onboard Shi Yan 6 during two days of research activities along the western seaboard of the island. Apart from our scientists and researchers, the Sri Lanka navy too will be monitoring this vessel, Fonseka told AFP. The 90-metre (300-foot) vessel is anchored at the Colombo harbour where a Chinese state-run company operates a deep sea terminal. A pair of Chinese submarines docked there in 2014, raising protests from India. There was no immediate comment from either the Chinese or Indian diplomatic missions in Sri Lanka after Colombo granted limited approvals to Shi Yan 6. Chinese state broadcaster CGTN calls the Shi Yan 6 a scientific research vessel with a crew of 60 to conduct oceanography, geology and marine ecology tests. Another Chinese research vessel, Yuan Wang 5, which specialises in spacecraft tracking and which New Delhi described as a spy ship, visited Sri Lanka last year. It docked in Hambantota, a port in Sri Lankas south under a 99-year lease to the Chinese company that built it after Colombo was unable to service a 1.4 billion loan taken for the project. Sri Lanka defaulted on its 46 billion external debt last year in an unprecedented economic crisis partly blamed on Chinese loans used to build white-elephant infrastructure projects between 2005 and 2015. China owns 52 percent of Sri Lankas bilateral debt, and Beijings approval is crucial for any efforts by Colombo to restructure its outstanding loans.",

        "title": "China and Russia take aim at US at Chinese military forum",
        "date": "October 30, 2023 01:05 pm",
        "content": "Chinese and Russian military chiefs targeted the United States for criticism at a security forum in Beijing on Monday, even as Chinas second-most-senior military commander vowed to boost defence ties with Washington. The lack of regular communications between the U.S. and Chinese militaries has been a persistent worry for Washington amid tensions between the countries and the risk of an accidental clash in the South China Sea or near Taiwan. The Beijing Xiangshan Forum, Chinas biggest annual show of military diplomacy, began Sunday without the countrys defence minister, who typically hosts the event, but included a U.S. delegation amid roiling regional tensions. Russias Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu warned the West that its involvement in the Ukraine war created grave danger. The Western line of steady escalation of the conflict with Russia carries the threat of a direct military clash between nuclear powers, which is fraught with catastrophic consequences, Russias TASS state news agency cited Shoigu as saying at the forum. Shoigu also said the West intends to inflict strategic defeat on Russia in a hybrid war, and praised the model of Russia-China relations as exemplary, Russian state media reported. Zhang Youxia, vice chairman under President Xi Jinping on Chinas Central Military Commission, delivered veiled criticism of the United States and its allies, accusing some countries of trying to undermine the government. But in other parts of his speech, Zhang stressed the need for improved military ties with the United States. We will deepen strategic cooperation and coordination with Russia and are willing to, on the basis of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation, develop military ties with the U.S., Zhang said in an address being closely watched by military attaches and diplomats amid tensions over Taiwan and the South China Sea. Chinas defence minister delivered the keynote speech in previous years. China and the U.S. have had no high-level military-to-military communications since the Washington-sanctioned former Chinese defence minister, Li Shangfu, was appointed in March. Li was sacked last week without explanation, and China did not name a replacement. Reuters reported last month that Li, who has been missing for two months, was being investigated over corruption. The U.S. defence department has sent a delegation led by Cynthia Xanthi Carras, China country director in the Office of the Undersecretary of Defense. It is not yet known whether the U.S. team will meet separately with Chinese military officials. The participation of the U.S. delegation comes as the United States and China ramp up exchanges ahead of an expected summit between U.S. President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping next month. Last week, Chinas top diplomat, Wang Yi, met with Biden for an hour in talks the White House described as a good opportunity to keep open lines of communication between the two geopolitical rivals. Despite the conciliatory remarks about improving China-U.S. military relations, Zhang and some PLA officers gave no sign of a softer stance on issues such as Taiwan, which Beijings regards as its own territory. Chinese Lieutenant General He Lei, speaking at a panel on Sunday, said that if China has to use force against Taiwan, it will be a war for reunification, a just and legitimate war. In his speech, Zhang said that countries should not deliberately provoke other countries on major and sensitive issues, he said, adding that Taiwan is a core interest of China. Many Western countries have either shunned the forum or are only sending small and low-level delegations, preferring instead to discuss international security issues at the Shangri-La Dialogue, held annually in Singapore. Together with the commissions third-ranked official, He Weidong, Zhang held bilateral meetings with defence ministers from Laos, Mongolia, Belarus, East Timor and Myanmar, according to state media.

        "title": "Aswesuma: Aug and Sept payments to be credited in Nov",
        "date": "October 30, 2023 02:59 pm",
        "content": "State Minister of Finance Shehan Semasinghe states that Aswesuma payments for the month of August will be credited to the beneficiary accounts on Wednesday (Nov. 01). Meanwhile, the allowance for September will also be credited during the month of November, he said. Semasinghe further expressed that the Aswesuma applicants who were not selected for the benefit scheme due to technical and management issues will be screened once again during Aswesuma Week, which is due to be held from 06 to 12 November. Accordingly, the eligible individuals selected then will receive the benefits with effect from July 2023, the State Minister added. In an effort to streamline the Aswasuma benefit program and address ongoing concerns, the Ministry of Finance has announced the implementation of an Aswasuma Week from November 6th to 11th. The objective of this initiative is to promptly rectify the issues plaguing the program and ensure that deserving beneficiaries receive their entitled support without further delay, the Presidents Media Division (PMD) reported. State Minister of Finance, Shehan Semasinghe, said that this initiative aims to provide immediate support to families who have not yet received their entitled benefits. Furthermore, it extends its support to those who have been selected as relief beneficiaries, as well as those whose benefits have been subject to delay due to technical complications. During a press conference held at the Presidential Media Centre (PMC) today (30), State Minister Semasinghe unveiled the upcoming Aswasuma Week and elaborated on its core goals. He stressed that Aswasuma Week will facilitate the swift distribution of benefits to families who have encountered difficulties in receiving their entitled assistance. This includes both families who have not yet received any benefits and those who have experienced delays due to technical issues. Moreover, the State Minister of Finance confirmed that various government departments, including the Presidential Secretariat, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Public Administration and Divisional Secretariats, are dedicated to resolving issues related to relief beneficiaries during this designated week. This concerted effort reflects the governments dedication to addressing the concerns of those reliant on the Aswasuma program. In addition to the forthcoming resolution of existing issues, the State Minister announced that all payments for the month of July have been successfully distributed to beneficiaries, with payments for August set to commence from the upcoming Wednesday. State Minister Semasinghe reiterated that Aswasuma Week should not be mistaken for a call for applications for the upcoming year. Instead, it is an initiative aimed at addressing unresolved issues from the current years application submissions. The Welfare Board is collaborating with Divisional Secretariats to ensure that beneficiaries are informed about the progress made. The State Minister of Finance also provided a financial outlook, indicating that Rs. 8.5 billion will be distributed to 1,365,000 beneficiaries within the next two days, enabling beneficiaries to access their funds starting from November 01 (Wednesday). Subsequently, payments for the month of September are expected to be completed before the end of the following month. The State Minister acknowledged that while there havent been financial issues, technical complications, such as problems with bank accounts, have posed challenges. Nevertheless, the government is determined to resolve these technical issues promptly to expedite payments. State Minister Semasinghe recognized the profound impact of the economic downturn on vulnerable populations and assured that the government is committed to mitigating their hardships. He emphasized the governments commitment to accelerating the distribution of financial aid, with the goal of finalizing payments for July through December by the end of the year. Additionally, the government plans to broaden its focus to address various other aspects when inviting applications. In conclusion, State Minister Shehan Semasinghe acknowledged the less popular economic decisions taken by the President Ranil Wickremesinghe and the government and highlighted their vital role in achieving economic stability. He emphasized that the governments efforts extend to benefiting both government employees and the general public, ultimately fostering a robust and resilient national economy.",
