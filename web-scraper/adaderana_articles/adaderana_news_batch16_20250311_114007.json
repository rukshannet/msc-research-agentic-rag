        "title": "India detects first suspected HMPV case, 8-month-old baby infected",
        "date": "January 6, 2025 11:43 am",
        "content": "India has detected its first suspected Human Metapneumovirus (HMPV) case in Bengaluru in an eight-month old baby. Sources from the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) said that the suspected case was detected through a private laboratory, and that the patient and its family have no travel history. The case has come from Hunasanahalli in Bengaluru Rural district. The child has been admitted to the Bengaluru Baptist Hospital, the source said, adding the child will be discharged today. HMPV is a viral respiratory infection that causes symptoms resembling the common cold. It spreads via droplets, direct contact, and possibly airborne particles. Symptoms range from mild, such as a runny nose, to severe, including breathing difficulties and chest pain. The Centre had last week announced that it is closely monitoring the situation following a surge in respiratory illnesses in China, adding that there was no cause for panic as the virus was not new to India. Medical experts say that the virus has been present in India for years and predominantly impacts paediatric population between six to twelve months of age, though it can also be present in children up to fourteen years old. Addressing concerns, Director General Health Services (DGHS) Atul Goel on Friday had said that HMPV is similar to other respiratory viruses, causing flu-like symptoms in very young children. There was no significant increase in respiratory illness cases reported at our centres in December 2024, he had said. The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW) had also convened a joint monitoring group meeting over the issue to assess the outbreak on Saturday. The government will continue to keep a close watch on the outbreak through all available channels, the ministry had stated. It added that the World Health Organization (WHO) has also been requested to provide timely updates on the situation in China. To strengthen preparedness, the group has recommended increasing the number of laboratories testing for HMPV under Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR)s network, to monitor HMPV trends throughout the year. Taking cue, health departments of several states such as Karnataka, Delhi and Kerala have started monitoring to look out for cases of HMPV, with ministers or departments sharing public statements over preparedness. Kerala Health Minister Veena George on Saturday had said that the state was closely monitoring the recent reports of an outbreak of HMPV in China. Similarly, the Karnataka health department is also expected to issue an advisory on precautionary measures by Monday afternoon. Source: Business Standard --Agencies",

        "title": "The Brutalist, Emilia Perez triumph at Golden Globes",
        "date": "January 6, 2025 11:52 am",
        "content": "Two wildly audacious films  Brady Corbets 215-minute postwar epic The Brutalist and Jacques Audiards Spanish language, genre-shifting trans musical Emilia Perez  won top honors at the 82nd Golden Globes on Sunday. The Globes, which are still finding their footing after years of scandal and makeover, scattered awards around to a number of films. But the awards group put its strongest support behind a pair of movies that sought to be unlike anything else. The Brutalist was crowed best film, drama, putting one of 2024s most ambitious films on course to be a major contender at the Academy Awards. The film, shot in VistaVision and released with an intermission, also won best director for Corbet and best actor for Adrien Brody. I was told that this film was un-distributable, said Corbet. No one was asking for a three-and-half-hour film about a mid-century designer in 70mm. But it works. Emilia Pérez won best film, comedy or musical, elevating the Oscar chances of Netflixs top Oscar contender. It also won best supporting actress for Zoe Saldaña, best song (El Mal) and best non-English language film. Karla Sofía Gascón, the films transgender star who plays a Mexican drug lord who undergoes gender affirming surgery, spoke for the film. The light always wins over darkness, said Gascón, gesturing to her brightly orange dress. You can maybe put us in jail. You can beat us up. But you never can take away our soul or existence or identity. I am who I am. Not who you want. The nights big actor winners included some surprises. One shocker was Moores win for best actress in a comedy or musical. Her comeback performance in The Substance, about a Hollywood star who resorts to an experimental process to regain her youth, landed the 62-year-old Moore her first Globe  a victory that came over the heavily favored Mikey Madison of Anora. Im just in shock right now. Ive been doing this a long time, like over 45 years, and this is the first thing Ive ever won as an actor, said Moore, who was last nominated by the Globes for a film role in 1991 for Ghost. Thirty years ago, I had a producer tell me that I was a popcorn actress. Best actress, in a drama film, was a surprise, too. The Brazilian actress Fernanda Torres won for her performance in Im Still Here, a based-on-a-true-story drama about a family living through the disappearance of political dissident Rubens Paiva in 1970s Rio de Janeiro. Best supporting actor in a musical or comedy went to Sebastian Stan for another movie about physical transformation: A Different Man, in which Stan plays a man with a deformed face whos healed. Stan, who was also nominated for playing Donald Trump in The Apprentice, noted that both films were hard to get made. These are tough subject maters but these films are real and theyre necessary, said Stan. But we cant be afraid and look away. Glaser lightly roasts the Globes Comedian Nikki Glaser kicked off the Globes, with a promise: Im not here to roast you. But Glaser, a stand-up whose breakthrough came in a withering roast of Tom Brady, made her way around the ballroom of the Beverly Hilton in Beverly Hills, California, on Sunday picking out plenty of targets in an opening monologue she had worked out extensively in comedy clubs beforehand. While Glaser might not have reached Tina Fey and Amy Poehler levels of laughs, the monologue was mostly a winner, and a dramatic improvement over last years host, Jo Koy. Last years Globes, following a diversity and ethics scandal that led to the dissolution of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, were widely panned, but delivered where it counted. Ratings rebounded to about 10 million viewers, according to Nielsen. CBS, who waded in after NBC dumped the Globes, signed up for five more years. Hosting the Globes two weeks before the inauguration of Donald Trump, Glaser reserved perhaps her most cutting line for the whole room of Hollywood stars. You could really do anything ... except tell the country who to vote for, said Glaser. But its OK, youll get em next time ... if there is one. Im scared. The Globes are now owned by Todd Boehlys Eldridge Industries and Dick Clark Productions, which acquired the award show from the now defunct Hollywood Foreign Press Association. After diversity and ethics scandals, the HFPA sold off the Globes and dissolved. However, more than a dozen former HFPA members are seeking to have the sale to Eldridge Industries and Dick Clark Productions rescinded. A win for Wicked The Globes award for cinematic and box-office achievement went to Jon M. Chus Wicked, which has nearly collected 700 million in theaters. In a heavily arthouse Oscar field, Wicked is easily the biggest hit seen as having a chance to win best picture. Accepting the award, Chu argued for a radical act of optimism in art. Though few film awards have been predictable this season, Kieran Culkin is emerging has the clear favorite for best supporting actor. Culkin won Sunday for his performance in Jesse Eisenbergs A Real Pain, his second Globe in the past year following a win for the HBO series Succession. He called the Globes basically the best date night that my wife and I ever have, and then thanked her for putting up what you call my mania. The papal thriller Conclave took best screenplay, for Peter Straughans script. Flow, the wordless Latvian animated parable about a cat in a flooded world, took best animated film, winning over studio blockbusters like Inside Out 2 and The Wild Robot. Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross won best score for their thumping music for Challengers. TV prizes Most of the TV winners were oft-awarded series, including the Emmy champ Shōgun. It won four awards, including best drama series and acting wins for Hiroyuki Sanada, Anna Sawai and Tadanobu Asano. Other repeat winners were: Hacks (best comedy series, actress for Jean Smart), The Bear (Jeremy Allen White for best actor) and Baby Reindeer (best limited series). Ali Wong won for best stand-up performance, Jodie Foster for True Detective and Colin Farrell for his physical transformation in The Penguin. I guess its prosthetics from here on out, said Farrell.

        "date": "January 6, 2025 01:34 pm",
        "content": "The Parliament of Sri Lanka has issued a clarification regarding a recent media report claiming the actual expenses of the tea receptions held after the inaugural session of the Tenth Parliament. Issuing the clarification, the Parliamentary Communications Department noted that the media report highlighted that Rs. 287,340 was spent on tea receptions following the inaugural session of the Ninth Parliament on August 20, 2020, while Rs. 339,628.55 was incurred for the same event after the Tenth Parliaments inaugural session on November 21, 2024. In response, the Parliament of Sri Lanka addressed the differences in expenditure, citing the following reasons: 1. Inflation and Price Increases The four-year period between the two inaugural sessions witnessed significant market price fluctuations, the Parliamentary Communications Department highlighted, adding that the cost of goods and services in 2024 had risen substantially, leading to a nearly 100 increase in food preparation costs compared to 2020. 2. Larger Attendance Furthermore, the Parliament of Sri Lanka said that the tea reception for the Tenth Parliament saw increased participation, including not only Members of Parliament but also high-ranking officials, such as diplomats, ministry secretaries, invited guests, and parliamentary staff officers. This broader attendance contributed to the higher overall expenses, the statement clarified. The Parliamentary Communications Department emphasized that these factors were important in understanding the variance in costs and ensuring transparency in the allocation of funds for ceremonial events.",

During this period, no punitive actions will be taken, but offenders will be issued warnings. After the grace period, a special traffic operation will be enforced under the Clean Sri Lanka national initiative. The Acting Inspector General of Police has instructed traffic officers to focus on vehicles with dangerous and unlawful modifications. The police urge all three-wheeler drivers to comply with these regulations before January 19 to avoid penalties.

United will begin testing Starlink in February, and its first commercial flight with the service will launch this spring on the airlines Embraer E-175 aircraft. The airline plans to outfit its entire two-cabin regional fleet by the end of 2025 and have its first mainline Starlink-enabled plane in the air by the end of the year. Starlink will eventually be available on every United flight. Musk, who heads or owns a cluster of companies ranging from electric vehicle maker Tesla to Starlink parent company SpaceX, has used his portfolio of businesses  and his massive wealth  to amass influence far beyond just the tech world. The United deal is another sign of how his businesses have found their way into industries across the US economy.

        "date": "January 6, 2025 05:58 pm",
        "content": "Syrias finance minister said on Sunday the government would hike salaries for many public sector employees by 400 next month after completing an administrative restructuring of ministries to boost efficiency and accountability. The increase, estimated to cost 1.65 trillion Syrian pounds, or about 127 million at current rates, will be financed by existing state resources plus a combination of regional aid, new investments, and efforts to unfreeze Syrian assets held abroad. (This is) the first step towards an emergency solution to the economic reality in the country, Mohammed Abazeed, the finance minister in Syrias caretaker government, told Reuters, adding that this months wages for public sector staff would be paid out this week. These measures are part of a broader strategy by Syrias new caretaker government to stabilize the countrys economy following 13 years of conflict and sanctions. Salaries of Syrias public sector employees under toppled President Bashar al-Assads regime were around 25 a month, putting them below the poverty line, along with the majority of the countrys population, Abazeed said. The hike would follow a comprehensive evaluation of up to 1.3 million registered public sector employees to remove fictitious employees from the payroll and would affect those with sufficient expertise, academic qualifications, and the necessary skills for reconstruction. Syrias state treasury is facing liquidity challenges emerging from a war. The majority of money available in the central bank is Syrian currency, which has lost much of its value. However, the new government was promised assistance from regional and Arab countries, the minister said. The launch of investments in the country in the near future will also benefit the state treasury and allow us to finance this salary increase, he said, adding the central bank currently has sufficient funds to finance the next few months. The government expects to retrieve up to 400 million in frozen Syrian assets abroad, which could co-finance the initial government expenses. Syrias caretaker government is also discussing exempting taxpayers, as much as possible, from penalties and interest and working on overhauling the tax system within the next three months to achieve tax justice for all taxpayers, with a first draft expected within four months. By the end of this year, we expect having a well-designed tax system that takes the interests of all taxpayers into account, he added. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

According to the Straits Times, Malaysias Health Ministry urged the public to practice preventive measures, including frequent handwashing with soap, wearing face masks, and covering the mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing. The public is advised to proactively take care of their health and prevent infection to others, especially in enclosed and crowded areas, the ministry stated. This includes those planning to travel to countries at risk. Meanwhile, India has reported two cases of human metapneumovirus (HMPV). Two infants were infected with the virus in Karnatakas Bengaluru, the Union Health Ministry said on Monday (January 6). One case is also suspected in Gujarat. The HMPV infection in India was detected in a three-month old girl and an eight-month old boy who were treated at Baptist hospital-Bengaluru. Both the children came in with symptoms of pneumonia, the girl has since been discharged and the boy is recovering, the Indian media reported. Clarifying the status of the virus, the Indian Health Ministry issued a statement, saying, HMPV is already in circulation globally, including in India, and cases of respiratory illnesses associated with HMPV have been reported in various countries. It added that there was no history of international travel in the two cases that were picked up during surveillance, meaning that these infections have no connection to the reported surge in respiratory infections in China. This comes amid a surge in HMPV cases in China, leading to overcrowded hospitals and fears of a wider outbreak. The respiratory virus, which causes symptoms similar to a cold, was also detected in Malaysia last year. Five years after the outbreak of the deadly Covid-19 pandemic that claimed over 7 million lives across the global, the HMPV virus in China is being monitored by several countries. HMPV infections have been documented nationwide in China as the government has ramped up screening, identification and isolation procedures to address unidentified infections. Various videos on social media depicted a scary scene at hospitals, with individuals wearing masks crammed into waiting areas. Frightening videos show patients coughing at the hospitals amid a spike in respiratory illness. Officials have said that China seen an increase in HMPV cases, particularly among children under the age of 14 in northern areas, reported news agency Reuters. Rising cases of HMPV in China The spike in cases coincides with colder weather and increased indoor activity, conditions that typically fuel the spread of respiratory viruses. Health officials emphasize that this surge is consistent with seasonal trends. Chinas National Disease Control and Prevention Administration recently reported an increase in respiratory infections, including HMPV, during the winter. The World Health Organisation (WHO) has not flagged the situation as a global health emergency, but the rise in cases has prompted authorities to bolster monitoring systems. A pilot programme has been launched to track pneumonia of unknown origin, ensuring labs and health agencies report and manage cases more effectively, state broadcaster CCTV reported, quoting an administration official at a news conference. Can HMPV virus spread to other countries? Hong Kong has reported a few cases of HMPV. Neighbouring countries like Cambodia and Taiwan are keeping a close watch on the situation. Cambodias Communicable Disease Control Department has issued warnings about HMPV, noting its similarity to Covid-19 and influenza. Taiwans Centers for Disease Control has said the viruss higher risks for children, the elderly, and immune-compromised individuals. In neighbouring India, officials said there is no need for panic as HMPV is like any other respiratory virus. Why is HMPV in the news? China is currently experiencing a surge in HMPV cases, alongside other respiratory illnesses like influenza A, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and COVID-19. Reports suggest hospitals in some regions are overwhelmed, but Chinese authorities and the World Health Organization (WHO) have not declared a state of emergency. Who is most at risk from HMPV? HMPV can affect people of all ages, but the most vulnerable groups include: -Children under five, particularly infants. -Older adults, especially those over 65. -People with weakened immune systems or chronic respiratory conditions like asthma or COPD. How does HMPV spread? HMPV spreads through: -Respiratory droplets from coughing or sneezing. -Close contact, such as shaking hands or touching someone infected. -Contact with contaminated surfaces, followed by touching the mouth, nose, or eyes. -The virus often circulates seasonally, peaking in late winter and spring in temperate regions. What are the symptoms of HMPV? According to the CDC, symptoms include: -Cough and runny or stuffy nose. -Fever. -Sore throat. -Wheezing or shortness of breath in severe cases. In more serious cases, it can escalate to bronchitis, pneumonia, or asthma exacerbations. How is HMPV diagnosed? Testing is rare unless symptoms are severe or part of an outbreak. Diagnostic methods include: -Nucleic Acid Amplification Test (NAAT): Detects viral genome in respiratory secretions. -Immunofluorescence or Enzyme Immunoassay: Detects viral antigens. How can HMPV be prevented? -The CDC recommends the following precautions: -Wash hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. -Avoid touching your face with unwashed hands. -Wear masks in crowded areas during outbreaks. -Stay home when sick to prevent spreading the virus. -Clean frequently touched surfaces regularly. Is there a treatment for HMPV? There is no specific antiviral treatment or vaccine for HMPV. Symptom management includes: -Staying hydrated and getting adequate rest. -Using over-the-counter (OTC) medications for pain, congestion, and fever. -Severe cases may require hospitalization for oxygen therapy or intravenous fluids. How does HMPV compare to COVID-19? -Both HMPV and COVID-19 cause respiratory symptoms such as coughing, fever, congestion, and shortness of breath. They also spread through respiratory droplets. -HMPV: Peaks during winter and spring. -COVID-19: Spreads year-round due to evolving variants. -Post-COVID-19 lockdowns, surges in HMPV cases have been observed as populations re-expose themselves to respiratory pathogens. When should you seek medical attention? Consult a healthcare provider if symptoms: -Worsen after a few days. -Include difficulty breathing or cyanosis (bluish skin). -Occur alongside chronic health conditions like asthma or COPD. Is HMPV a new pandemic threat? No, HMPV is not a new virus or an imminent pandemic threat. Seasonal surges are common, particularly during the winter months. However, the increase in cases post-COVID-19 restrictions has raised concerns. The HMPV virus was first identified in children in 2001 in the Netherlands. Infection with HMPV usually occurs by the age of five years with reinfection occurring throughout life as immune protection induced by the virus is too weak to prevent repeated infections. The virus causes upper andor lower respiratory tract infections, with lower respiratory tract infections being among the most common. While the virus often causes only mild disease, it can lead to severe illness requiring hospitalisation in children, immunocompromised populations and the elderly. Globally, 3-10 of hospital admissions and 1 of acute lower respiratory infection-related deaths in children under age five in 2018 are attributed to HMPV, as per a 2021 paper. The study also found that children younger than six months, especially those in low- and lower-middle-income countries, are at greater risk of death caused by the HMPV virus. Detection of a large number of HMPV cases among children aged less than 14 years in China is a reflection of the heightened surveillance and testing for the virus. --With agencies inputs",

        "title": "Canada PM Trudeau is likely to announce resignation, source says",
        "date": "January 6, 2025 08:19 pm",
        "content": "Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is increasingly likely to announce he intends to step down, though he has not made a final decision, a source familiar with Trudeaus thinking said on Sunday. The source spoke to Reuters after the Globe and Mail reported that Trudeau was expected to announce as early as Monday that he would quit as leader of Canadas ruling Liberal Party after nine years in office. The source requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly. Trudeaus departure would leave the party without a permanent head at a time when polls show the Liberals will badly lose to the official opposition Conservatives in an election that must be held by late October. Sources told the Globe and Mail that they did not know definitely when Trudeau would announce his plans to leave but said they expect it would happen before a emergency meeting of Liberal legislators on Wednesday. An increasing number of Liberal parliamentarians, alarmed by a series of gloomy polls, have publicly urged Trudeau to quit. The prime ministers office did not immediately respond to a request for comment outside regular business hours. The prime ministers regularly published schedule for Monday said he would participate virtually in a cabinet committee meeting on Canada-U.S. relations. It remains unclear whether Trudeau will leave immediately or stay on as prime minister until a new Liberal leader is selected, the Globe and Mail report added. Calls to resign grow Trudeau took over as Liberal leader in 2013 when the party was in deep trouble and had been reduced to third place in the House of Commons for the first time. If he does resign, it would likely spur fresh calls for a quick election to put in place a stable government able to deal with the administration of President-elect Donald Trump for the next four years. The prime minister has discussed with Finance Minister Dominic LeBlanc whether he would be willing to step in as interim leader and prime minister, one source told the newspaper, adding that this would be unworkable if LeBlanc plans to run for the leadership. Trudeau, 53, had been able to fend off Liberal legislators worried about the polls and the loss of safe seats in two special elections. But calls for him to step aside have grown since December, when Trudeau tried to demote Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland, one of his closest cabinet allies, after she pushed back against his proposals for more spending. Freeland quit instead and penned a letter accusing Trudeau of political gimmicks rather than focusing on what was best for the country. Trudeau propelled the Liberals to power in 2015 promising sunny ways and a progressive agenda that promoted the rights of women and a promise to fight climate change. But the everyday realities of governing gradually wore him down and like many Western leaders, the need to deal with the effects of the pandemic ate up much of his time. Although Ottawa spent heavily to protect consumers and businesses, racking up record budget deficits, this provided little protection from public anger as prices soared. A botched immigration policy led to hundreds of thousands of arrivals, straining an already overheated housing market. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "date": "January 7, 2025 08:27 am",
        "content": "A New York judge will not delay this Fridays sentencing of President-elect Donald Trump in his felony hush money case. Justice Juan Merchan said the sentencing would proceed as Trumps arguments against it are for the most part, a repetition of the arguments he has raised numerous times in the past. In court filings, Trumps attorneys had argued that they sought a dismissal of this politically motivated prosecution that was flawed from the very beginning. His legal team is seeking a hearing on the matter with the appellate court. Trump was found guilty on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records in May, making him the first former president convicted of a crime. Defendants motion for a stay of these proceedings, including the sentencing hearing scheduled for January 10, 2025, is hereby DENIED, Justice Merchan wrote in his decision on Monday. The charges stemmed from Trumps attempt to disguise reimbursements for a 130,000 hush money payment to an adult film star as legal expenses. Trump pleaded not guilty and denied any wrongdoing. His lawyers said that filing an appeal should halt the criminal proceedings in his New York case. The sentencing had been delayed repeatedly by the 2024 presidential election and Trumps attempt to have the case thrown out based on a claim of presidential immunity. Justice Merchan ultimately rejected the immunity argument in December. On 3 January, Justice Merchan issued an order saying he would move ahead with the sentencing before Trump takes office on 20 January, but made clear he would not consider any custodial term. He indicated he would instead issue a sentence of an unconditional discharge, which means no prison, fine or probation. Justice Merchan ordered Trump to appear virtually or in-person for the hearing. Steven Cheung, spokesman for Trumps presidential transition, reiterated his argument that the prosecution was unlawful. He said in a statement: The American People elected President Trump with an overwhelming mandate that demands an immediate end to the political weaponisation of our justice system and all of the remaining Witch Hunts. Trumps team has not publicly commented on whether the president-elect will be in court this Friday. But in its response on Monday afternoon to the request for a stay, the Manhattan district attorneys office referred to the defendants decision to appear for sentencing virtually instead of in person. The reference to a virtual hearing was repeated again several pages later. In the response, the district attorney asked the judge to deny Trumps request for an immediate stay of his sentencing, and argued he would not be prejudiced by such a decision. The weeks after the election featured a flurry of legal filings from both Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, who brought the case, and Trumps legal team. Braggs office had previously indicated that they would not oppose delaying Trumps sentencing until after he finishes his term in office, four years from now. But after Justice Merchan decided to move ahead with the sentencing, Bragg asked the judge to proceed with sentencing on Friday. In his order last week, Justice Merchan wrote that it is this courts firm belief that only by bringing finality to this matter would the legal quandaries at play be resolved. However, the judge left the door open to further Trump legal challenges, writing that he must be permitted to avail himself of every available appeal. Source: BBC --Agencies",

Dr. Weerasinghe stated that the Central Bank had conducted an analysis between May and June 2024 to evaluate the necessity of allowing new vehicle imports, particularly as the economy shows signs of improvement. We have not permitted new vehicle imports for the past five years. When the economy begins to recover, the country will inevitably require new vehicles. My recommendation is to allow the renewal of vehicle while maintaining the current value of the vehicle market. Individuals wishing to replace their vehicles should be given the opportunity to do so by paying an additional fee, he explained. The Governor highlighted the impact of changes in the exchange rate and taxes, such as the 18 VAT, on vehicle prices. Allowing the import of a five-year-old vehicle into the market for Rs. 5 million under current conditions would devalue existing vehicles and result in a flood of unnecessary new vehicle imports. To prevent this, a balanced approach is essential. A new vehicle purchase should occur only when necessary, with individuals required to pay a higher amount, Dr. Weerasinghe emphasized.",

However, health authorities have assured the public that there is no cause for undue alarm. Addressing a media conference held in Colombo, virologist Dr. Jude Jayamaha explained the nature of the virus and its symptoms. HMPV typically causes mild symptoms such as a cough, runny nose, and low-grade fever. In some cases, individuals with chronic illnesses may experience more severe symptoms like difficulty in breathing or pneumonia. However, these complications are rare, Dr. Jayamaha stated. He further emphasized that the virus is not fatal in most cases, with the majority of patients recovering within a few days without requiring special testing or treatment. Theres no need to create unnecessary fear. The probability of fatal outcomes is extremely low. The best course of action is to rest and manage symptoms, he added. Dr. Jayamaha advised the public to follow basic health precautions, such as maintaining hygiene and seeking medical advice if symptoms worsen, especially for those with pre-existing health conditions. How can HMPV be prevented? The CDC (Centers for Disease Control and PreventionUSA) recommends the following precautions: -Wash hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. -Avoid touching your face with unwashed hands. -Wear masks in crowded areas during outbreaks. -Stay home when sick to prevent spreading the virus. -Clean frequently touched surfaces regularly.

        "content": "Four years to the day after a mob of Donald Trumps supporters violently besieged the US Capitol, Congress formally certified the incoming presidents re-election in a special session. Vice-President Kamala Harris, who Trump defeated in the 2024 election, presided over the event as required by the US Constitution. But the shadow of 6 January 2021 lingered over Mondays proceedings, despite Trump and his allies campaign to recast the attack as a day of love. Heavy security was in place in Washington DC, and current President Joe Biden vowed there would be no repeat of the violence four years ago. Trump celebrated the moment on Truth Social, writing: Congress certifies our great election victory today - a big moment in history. The day was extraordinary in its normalcy, given the chaos of four years before. Harris stood at the front of the US House chamber with a sombre expression as lawmakers read out each states election results before formally declaring their authenticity. Though the results declared Trump the victor, Harris received a standing ovation from the Democratic side of the chamber when she read out her own electoral vote tally. Vice-president-elect JD Vance was in attendance. Seated directly next to him was Republican Senator Bill Cassidy, one of the few remaining Republican senators who voted to convict Trump in an impeachment trial stemming from the riot - that vote ultimately failed and Trump was acquitted. Earlier, House Speaker Mike Johnson had promised to go ahead with the certification in spite of the inclement weather, telling Fox News: Whether were in a blizzard or not, were going to be in that chamber making sure this is done. Harris, meanwhile, vowed to perform my constitutional duty as Vice President to certify the results of the 2024 election. This duty is a sacred obligation - one I will uphold guided by love of country, loyalty to our Constitution, and unwavering faith in the American people, she said in a video statement. Ordinarily there would be little need to remark on such procedures. The US Constitution requires the certification of a presidential election on 6 January, and for the vice-president to oversee the vote. But last time the US Congress gathered to certify the election of a US president, the vote was delayed for several hours because rioters, animated by a false belief that the 2020 election was stolen from Trump, smashed through windows, beat their way through lines of police officers, crashed the US House chamber, and ransacked the office of then-Speaker Nancy Pelosi and others. In a speech in Washington DC that day, before the violence broke out, Trump told a crowd to fight like hell but also asked them to peacefully make their voices heard. Lawmakers, including Republicans, were forced to take cover in the basement and Capitol staffers hid wherever they could find shelter. Then-Vice-President Mike Pence was whisked into hiding as rioters erected a gallows on the Capitol grounds and called for his hanging because he refused to inaccurately certify the results in Trumps favour. In the aftermath, Capitol Hill custodial workers worked furiously to clean up shattered windows and trashed corridors. Congressional staffers spent the next several months reckoning with the trauma of the attack. The riot caused nearly 3m (2.4m) in damage, injured more than 100 police officers, and shocked Americas political system. In the immediate wake of the attack, which millions of Americans watched unfold on television and social media, there was little debate over who deserved blame. The US House of Representatives impeached Trump on charges he incited the riot, but the US Senate did not achieve the two-thirds vote required to convict him. Then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican, explicitly blamed Trump, saying rioters did this because they had been fed wild falsehoods by the most powerful man on Earth  because he was angry hed lost an election. Trump himself faced federal charges for allegations that he attempted to subvert the 2020 election, to which he pleaded not guilty. But the Department of Justice (DoJ) was forced to drop the case once he was elected last year, due to protocols that prevented the prosecution of a sitting president. As Trump sought a return to power, he and his allies have worked to dramatically change the narrative around the riot and its cause. Trump said there was nothing done wrong at all, at an October 2024 presidential campaign forum. He has called the people convicted by the DoJ hostages and political prisoners. And his new vice-president, JD Vance, refused to acknowledge in a presidential debate that Trump lost the 2020 election. Americans now have starkly divided perspectives on the day. A January 2024 Washington PostUniversity of Maryland poll suggested that a quarter of Americans believed a conspiracy theory that the FBI instigated the attack. While a majority of Americans believed 6 January 2021 was an attack on democracy, only 18 of Republicans thought so, the poll indicated. Trumps second term will begin after he is inaugurated on 20 January. It represents a stunning political comeback from his electoral defeat in 2020, and a criminal conviction in 2024 - a first for a current or former US president. The president-elect has vowed to pardon people convicted of offences over the attack. He says many of them are wrongfully imprisoned, though has acknowledged that a couple of them, probably they got out of control. Biden has called on Americans never to forget what happened. We must remember the wisdom of the adage that any nation that forgets its past is doomed to repeat it, Biden wrote in the Washington Post over the weekend. For Trumps Republican Party, the new Senate Majority Leader John Thune has signalled a desire to move on, telling the BBCs US partner CBS News: You cant be looking in the rearview mirror.

        "content": "A strong earthquake killed at least 53 people in Tibet on Tuesday and left many others trapped as dozens of aftershocks shook the region of western China and across the border in Nepal. The official Xinhua News Agency said 62 other people were injured, citing the regional disaster relief headquarters. About 1,500 fire and rescue workers were deployed to search for people in the rubble, the Ministry of Emergency Management said. The U.S. Geological Survey said the earthquake measured magnitude 7.1 and was relatively shallow at a depth of about 10 kilometers (6 miles). China recorded the magnitude as 6.8. The epicenter was about 75 kilometers (50 miles) northeast of Mount Everest, which straddles the border. The area is seismically active and is where the India and Eurasia plates clash and cause uplifts in the Himalayan mountains strong enough to change the heights of some of the worlds tallest peaks. The average altitude in the area around the epicenter is about 4,200 meters (13,800 feet), the China Earthquake Networks Center said in a social media post. State broadcaster CCTV said there are a handful of communities within 5 kilometers (3 miles) of the epicenter, which was 380 kilometers (240 miles) from Lhasa, the capital of Tibet, and about 23 kilometers (14 miles) from the regions second-largest city of Shigatse, known as Xigaze in Chinese. About 230 kilometers (140 miles) away in Nepals capital, Kathmandu, the earthquake woke up residents and sent them running out of their homes into the streets. No information was immediately available from the remote, mountainous areas of Nepal closer to the epicenter. There have been 10 earthquakes of at least magnitude 6 in the area where Tuesdays quake hit over the past century, the USGS said. Source: AP --Agencies",

The strike followed the appointment of S.V. Chandrasinghe as acting Basnayake Nilame by the Commissioner for Buddhist Affairs. The appointment is intended to fill the position temporarily until a permanent Basnayake Nilame is named, following the expiration of the previous officeholders term.

Officials gathered to celebrate the milestone, commemorating the first time crossings could happen freely between the two nations. But it wasnt a dignitary or a vehicle that made the inaugural crossingit was an unexpected traveller. A stray dog, seemingly unaware of the fanfare, trotted across the border as the checkpoint lifted, becoming the first to step into this new era of open movement. The moment, captured in a now-viral video, showed the dog casually making its way across while the assembled officials broke into applause and cheers. One user wrote, I need this welcome every time I cross a border. Another user quipped, He shall be named King of Romania. A third user commented, The good boy knew what he was doing. A fourth person added, Most positive thing Ive seen today. The Schengen Area, a symbol of European unity, enables seamless travel without the need for passports among its member states. Bulgaria and Romania have now officially joined this border-free area, which has expanded to include 29 countries. This milestone came after a prolonged 13-year wait, finally achieved when Austria and other nations withdrew their objections. For Romania and Bulgaria, both part of the EU since 2007, this represents a significant achievement. Although they began easing border restrictions in March by removing checks at ports and airports, land borders remained under control until now due to concerns about migration, particularly from Austria.

        "content": "Foreign Minister Vijitha Herath in partnership with the Registrar Generals Department has launched the pilot project to facilitate overseas Sri Lankans to obtain certified copies of birth, marriage, and death certificates through Sri Lanka Missions abroad. The system provides Missions access to the e-BMD database (electronic - Birth, Marriage and Death certificate Database) of the Registrar Generals Department in Sri Lanka. The pilot project is initially implemented through the Sri Lanka Embassies  Consulates General in Tokyo (Japan), Kuwait, Doha (Qatar), Milan (Italy), Toronto (Canada), Melbourne (Australia), and Dubai (UAE). Building upon this, the Ministry and the Department will actively work towards periodically expanding the service to all other Sri Lankan Missions and Posts abroad, ensuring an efficient consular service to the Sri Lankan community, Sri Lankas foreign ministry said. Certified copies of birth, marriage and death certificates are a mandatory requirement for several purposes. The significant aspect of the pilot project is that it facilitates overseas Sri Lankans to obtain the required certified copies through Sri Lanka Missions overseas instead of their representatives in Sri Lanka having to do so on their behalf from the Office of the Registrar General. Upon application, the authorized Sri Lanka Missions will issue certified copies through retrieval of such certificates from the e-BMD database. Minister of Foreign Affairs, Foreign Employment, and Tourism Vijitha Herath, launched the pilot project at the Ministry in the presence of Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs and Foreign Employment Arun Hemachandra, Secretary of the Ministry Aruni Ranaraja, Registrar General W.R.A.N.S. Wijayasinghe and senior officials from the Presidential Secretariat, Registrar Generals Department, and the Ministry. Following the launch of the project by virtually connecting with the respective Sri Lanka Missions, Minister Herath described the initiative as an important milestone in the Governments journey towards a digital Sri Lanka. He went on to emphasize that national initiatives on digitalization should be extended to the Sri Lankans living abroad as well adding that this project - designed and implemented within two months - showcases the governments strong commitment and support to digitalization of services to the public, the statement said. Secretary Aruni Ranaraja in her remarks echoed the importance of delivering efficient and effective services to the public. While observing that digital platforms are an important tool for provisions of services to the public, she highlighted that through this initiative, the Ministry and Missions will enhance services to the overseas Sri Lankans. Sri Lankan expatriates residing in countries where the pilot project is now operational can apply for certified copies of birth, marriage, and death certificates by submitting the application forms available at the respective Missions and Posts.",

        "date": "January 8, 2025 08:35 am",
        "content": "A rapidly growing wildfire raged across an upscale section of Los Angeles on Tuesday, destroying homes and creating traffic jams as 30,000 people evacuated beneath huge plumes of smoke that covered much of the metropolitan area. At least 2,921 acres (1,182 hectares) of the Pacific Palisades area between the coastal towns of Santa Monica and Malibu had burned, officials said, after they had already warned of extreme fire danger from powerful winds that arrived following extended dry weather. The fire grew rapidly as officials warned the worst wind conditions were expected to come overnight, leading to concerns that more neighborhoods could be forced to flee. Witnesses reported a number homes on fire with flames nearly scorching their cars when people fled the hills of Topanga Canyon, as the fire spread from there down to the Pacific Ocean. We feel very blessed at this point that theres no injuries that are reported, Los Angeles Fire Chief Kristin Crowley told a press conference, adding that more than 25,000 people in 10,000 homes were threatened. Firefighters in aircraft scooped water from the sea to drop it on the nearby flames. Flames engulfed homes and bulldozers cleared abandoned vehicles from roads so emergency vehicles could pass, television images showed. As the sun set over Los Angeles, towering orange flames illuminated the hills leading to Topanga Canyon. The fire singed some trees on the grounds of the Getty Villa, a museum loaded with priceless works of art, but the collection remained safe largely because of preventive efforts to trim brush surrounding the buildings, the museum said. It will remain closed at least for the rest of the week. With only one major road leading from the canyon to the coast, and only one coastal highway leading to safety, traffic crawled to a halt, leading people to flee on foot. Cindy Festa, a Pacific Palisades resident, said that as she evacuated out of the canyon, fires were this close to the cars, demonstrating with her thumb and forefinger. People left their cars on Palisades Drive. Burning up the hillside. The palm trees - everything is going, Festa said from her car. Before the fire started, the National Weather Service had issued its highest alert for extreme fire conditions for much of Los Angeles County from Tuesday through Thursday, predicting wind gusts of 50 to 80 mph (80 to 130 kph). Strong, dry Santa Ana winds originating from inland deserts combined with low humidity and dry vegetation due to a lack of rain. The conditions were about as bad as it gets in terms of fire weather, the Los Angeles office of the National Weather Service said on X. Governor Gavin Newsom, who declared a state of emergency, said the state positioned personnel, firetrucks and aircraft elsewhere in Southern California because of the fire danger to the wider region, he added. Hopefully, were wrong, but were anticipating other fires happening concurrently, Newsom told the press conference. The winds changed President Joe Bidens travel plans, grounding Air Force One in Los Angeles. He had planned to make a short flight inland to the Coachella Valley for a ceremony to create two new national monuments in California but the event was rescheduled for a later date at the White House. Pacific Palisades is home to several Hollywood stars. Actor James Woods said on X he was able to evacuate but added, I do not know at this moment if our home is still standing. Actor Steve Guttenberg told KTLA television that friends of his were impeded from evacuating because others had abandoned their cars in the road. Its really important for everybody to band together and dont worry about your personal property. Just get out, Guttenberg said. Get your loved ones and get out. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "date": "January 8, 2025 10:11 am",
        "content": "Underwriting profitability for Sri Lankan non-life insurers will gradually improve as they enhance practices and shift focus to more profitable non-motor segments, Fitch Ratings says in a new report. This shift includes adjusting policy pricing, particularly for motor and medical insurance, to better cope with inflation and rising claim costs. Motor insurance profitability faces challenges due to regulatory changes requiring full premium remittance to the National Insurance Trust Fund Board. Non-life insurers have also been diversifying into non-motor segments such as health insurance due to prolonged import restrictions on motor vehicles. This diversification led to an 11 increase in non-motor gross premiums in 2023. Fitch believes that investment and liquidity risks have decreased following the upgrade of Sri Lankas sovereign rating in December 2024. Meanwhile, the upcoming implementation of IFRS 17 in January 2026 is likely to enhance transparency and comparability in the insurance market.",

She further highlighted that public involvement is necessary for this process and stated that the government comes to power prepared to face challenges. The Prime Minister further commented, The citizens of our country gave the government a mandate for profound transformation. This transformation is not just an individual change but a deeper shift that must occur at every level of society. When such a transformation is attempted, it will face challenges. There may be groups that oppose it, and that is a reality. We will never allow our program to be subordinated to the agenda of those who oppose this transformation. We represent the people of this country and respect the mandate given to us. Therefore, we are ready to face these challenges as a government and through our programs. She continued, We have always believed that this transformation does not require the involvement of political authority alone. It must happen through public participation. That is why we need to approach this ethically. This is not an institutional change, it is a social change. The Prime Minister also stated that within the transformation, there must be a change in the people through public participation.

        "date": "January 8, 2025 01:36 pm",
        "content": "President-elect Donald Trump is showing no sign of letting up in his desire for the US to acquire Greenland and the Panama Canal, calling both critical to American national security. Asked if he would rule out using military or economic force in order to take over the autonomous Danish territory or the Canal, he responded: No, I cant assure you on either of those two. But I can say this, we need them for economic security, he told reporters during a wide-ranging news conference at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida. Both Denmark and Panama have rejected any suggestion that they would give up territory. Trump also vowed to use economic force when asked if he would attempt to annex Canada and called their shared border an artificially drawn line. The boundary is the worlds longest between two countries and it was established in treaties dating back to the founding of the US in the late 1700s. The president-elect said the US spends billions of dollars protecting Canada, and he criticised imports of Canadian cars, lumber and dairy products. They should be a state, he told reporters. But outgoing Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said there isnt a snowballs chance in hell of the two countries merging. The news conference was initially billed as an economic development announcement to unveil Dubai developer Damac Properties 20bn investment to build data centres in the US. But the president-elect went on to criticise environmental regulations, the US election system, the various legal cases against him, and President Joe Biden. Among a variety of other things, he suggested renaming the Gulf of Mexico the Gulf of America and restated his opposition to wind power, saying wind turbines are driving the whales crazy. His remarks came as his son, Donald Trump Jr, was visiting Greenland. Before arriving in the capital Nuuk, Trump Jr said he was going on a personal day trip to talk to people, and had no meetings planned with government officials. When asked about Trump Jrs visit to Greenland, Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen told Danish TV that Greenland belongs to the Greenlanders and that only the local population could determine their future. She agreed that Greenland is not for sale, but stressed Denmark needed close co-operation with the US, a Nato ally. Greenland lies on the shortest route from North America to Europe and is home to a large American space facility. It also has some of the largest deposits of rare earth minerals, which are crucial in the manufacture of batteries and high-tech devices. Trump suggested the island is crucial to military efforts to track Chinese and Russian ships, which he said are all over the place. Im talking about protecting the free world, he told reporters. Since winning re-election Trump has repeatedly returned to the idea of US territorial expansion - including taking back the Panama Canal. During the news conference, Trump said the canal is vital to our country and claimed its being operated by China. He previously accused Panama of overcharging US ships to use the waterway, which connects the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. Panamanian President José Raúl Mulino has rejected Trumps claims and said there is absolutely no Chinese interference in the canal. A Hong Kong-based company, CK Hutchison Holdings, manages two ports at the canals entrances. The canal was built in the early 1900s and the US maintained control over the Canal Zone until 1977, when treaties negotiated under President Jimmy Carter gradually ceded the land back to Panama. Giving the Panama Canal to Panama was a very big mistake, Trump said. Look, Carter was a good man... But that was a big mistake. Its unclear how serious the president-elect is about adding to the territory of the US, particularly when it comes to Canada, a country of 41 million people and the second-largest nation by area in the world. During the news conference, Trump also repeated a number of falsehoods and odd conspiracy theories, including suggesting that Hezbollah, the Islamist militant group, was involved in the US Capitol riot of 2021.

        "date": "January 8, 2025 03:16 pm",
        "content": "Sri Lanka will focus on stronger recovery this year after the island nation posted real GDP growth of 5 in 2024, the highest in seven years, its central bank chief said on Wednesday, hoping to accelerate a rebound from its worst financial crisis in decades. Sri Lankas economy crumpled under a severe foreign exchange crisis in 2022, but has posted a faster than expected rally after it secured a 2.9 billion International Monetary Fund (IMF) program in March 2023 and completed a 25 billion debt restructuring in December. The economy grew 5.2 in the first nine months of 2024, outstripping the 3 estimate by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL), Governor P. Nandalal Weerasinghe said. Achieving a transformative acceleration in growth trajectory is essential to catch up and enhance the growth potential. This would also help enhance the debt-carrying capacity of the country, he said at an annual policy agenda launch. Taking advantage of lower inflation, which reached minus 1.7 in December, Sri Lankas central bank set a new single policy rate of 8, easing monetary settings below previously used benchmarks and setting the stage for stronger private sector credit growth, Weerasinghe added. Inflation is expected to reach positive territory in mid-2025, after which CBSL will focus on maintaining a 5 inflation rate. CBSL will also strengthen monetary policy forecasting, continue to improve its reserve buffers under the IMF program, and introduce a benchmark spot exchange rate in 2025. Weerasinghe said. Sri Lanka will continue recapitalisation of banks, consolidate large finance companies, and review the Statutory Reserve Ratio (SRR) of 2 to increase financial system stability, the Governor added.

        "date": "January 8, 2025 06:23 pm",
        "content": "More than 30,000 people evacuated their homes as a wildfire ripped through an upscale coastal area of Los Angeles on Tuesday and into Wednesday, with Hollywood celebrities among those fleeing by car and on foot as flames engulfed homes and set hillsides ablaze. Two other fires inland were also spreading fast, officials said. Numerous buildings were destroyed and nearly 3,000 acres (1,200 hectares) burned in the Pacific Palisades area between the beach towns of Santa Monica and Malibu, officials said. The area is home to many film and music stars. Roads were jammed with people fleeing the inferno, some abandoning their cars as flames licked the edges, and plumes of smoke and flames rose in the night sky over Los Angeles and its suburbs. Firefighters has not contained the blaze by the early hours and Governor Gavin Newsom has declared a state of emergency. Pacific Palisades resident Cindy Festa said that as she evacuated, fires were this close to the cars, demonstrating with her thumb and forefinger. People left their cars on Palisades Drive. Burning up the hillside. The palm trees - everything is going, Festa said from her car. A fire official told local television station KTLA that several people were injured in the Palisades Fire, some with burns to faces and hands. One female firefighter had suffered a head injury. Hollywood actor James Woods said on X he was able to evacuate his Pacific Palisades house but added: I do not know at this moment if our home is still standing. Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass said the windstorm is expected to worsen through the morning. A second blaze, dubbed the Eaton Fire, broke out some 30 miles (50 km) inland in Altadena, near Pasadena, and increased in size to 1,000 acres (400 hectares) from 200 acres in a few hours, according to Cal Fire. Almost 100 residents from a nursing home in Pasadena were evacuated, CBS News said. Video showed elderly residents, many in wheelchairs and on gurneys, crowded onto a smoky and windswept parking lot as fire trucks and ambulances attended. Fire officials said a third blaze named the Hurst Fire had started in Sylmar, in the San Fernando Valley northwest of Los Angeles, prompting evacuations of some nearby residents. The Hurst fire has grown to 500 acres (202 hectares) from 100 acres (40 hectares) earlier, according to Cal Fire. More than 220,000 homes and businesses in Los Angeles county were without power late on Tuesday, data from PowerOutage.us showed. PALISADES FIRE Witnesses reported a number of homes on fire with flames nearly scorching their cars when people fled the hills of Topanga Canyon as the fire spread from there down to the Pacific Ocean. Local media reported the fire had also spread north, torching homes near Malibu. Parts of Malibu and Santa Monica are under evacuation orders. Multiple burn victims were treated after walking toward Dukes restaurant in Malibu in the evening, the Los Angeles Times reported, citing a fire official. Los Angeles Fire Chief Kristin Crowley had earlier told a press conference that more than 25,000 people in 10,000 homes were threatened. Firefighting aircraft scooped water from the sea to drop it on the flames as they engulfed homes. Bulldozers cleared abandoned vehicles from roads so emergency vehicles could pass, television images showed. The fire singed some trees on the grounds of the Getty Villa, a museum loaded with priceless works of art, but the collection remained safe largely because nearby bushes had been trimmed as a preventive measure, the museum said. Before the fire started, the National Weather Service had issued its highest alert for extreme fire conditions for much of Los Angeles County from Tuesday through Thursday. With low humidity and dry vegetation due to a lack of rain, the conditions were about as bad as it gets in terms of fire weather, the service said. Governor Newsom said the state had positioned personnel, firetrucks and aircraft elsewhere in Southern California because of the fire danger to the wider region. California had secured federal grants to suppress all three fires, he said on Wednesday morning. BIDEN TRIP ABANDONED The powerful winds forced a change President Joe Bidens travel plans, grounding Air Force One in Los Angeles. He had planned to make a short flight inland to the Coachella Valley for a ceremony to create two new national monuments in California. I have offered any federal assistance that is needed to help suppress the terrible Pacific Palisades fire, Biden said in a statement. A federal grant had already been approved to help reimburse the state of California for its fire response, Biden said. Actor Steve Guttenberg told KTLA television that friends of his were impeded from evacuating because others had abandoned their cars in the road. Its really important for everybody to band together and dont worry about your personal property. Just get out, Guttenberg said. Get your loved ones and get out. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "content": "President Anura Kumara Disanayake has emphasized that Sri Lanka can enhance its position in the global market through a robust new product development strategy, which will also create new market opportunities. He made these remarks today (08) during the official launch of the National Initiative for RD Commercialization held at the Presidential Secretariat. As part of the initiative, the newly developed website nirdc.gov.lk was also launched. This platform aims to facilitate the commercialization of research and development, thereby contributing to sustainable economic growth through the production of value-added goods and services, which will ultimately drive national economic development and social progress, the President Media Division reported. The President pointed out that while grassroots-level innovators do emerge in Sri Lanka, there has been a lack of adequate mechanisms to properly support, nurture, and commercialize their ideas. He stressed the need to create an enabling environment for free and innovative thinking, backed by an efficient system to channel these ideas into productive outcomes. With such a framework in place, Sri Lanka can transform itself into a hub of innovation. Historically, the country has allocated a mere 0.12 of its annual GDP for research and development. Despite Sri Lankas abundance of natural resources, there has been limited focus on utilizing research to generate economic benefits. However, with the new government in place, a significant number of local and international investors have shown keen interest in investing in Sri Lanka. The government aims to capitalize on this momentum by efficiently managing investments to spur economic growth without delay, the PMD mentioned. The recently established Ministry of Science and Technology has already begun implementing a long-term, well-structured RD strategy. The immediate priority will be to convert near-complete or completed research projects into marketable, value-added products and services, providing a quick boost to the economy. To support this effort, the National Initiative for RD Commercialization (NIRDC) has been established, chaired jointly by the Secretary to the President, Dr. Nandika Sanath Kumanayake, and Senior Advisor to the President, Prof. Gomika Udugamasooriya. The initiative includes a committee comprising experts from diverse fields such as scientific research, industry, economics, law, arts, and indigenous heritage. During the event, President Disanayake highlighted that while human needs remain constant, the methods of fulfilling those needs evolve. He noted that innovation and new product development are key to shaping those new methods. Addressing past shortcomings, the President observed that Sri Lankas outdated approach to technology and innovation has hindered its ability to compete in the global market. Despite technological advancements driving a shift in global market trends, Sri Lanka remains trapped in traditional sectors like tea, coconut, and rubber, the PMD said. President Disanayake further underscored that globally leading companies have succeeded by integrating innovation with technology, noting that five out of the worlds top ten companies are technology-based. He pointed out Sri Lankas past neglect of technology as a key economic driver, contrasting it with developed countries that prioritized technological advancements and achieved significant economic growth. The President concluded by stating that eradicating poverty is essential not only to eliminate social suffering but also to restore the rights of marginalized communities. He asserted that through innovation, the rural poor can be empowered by ensuring their right to economic participation and access to information, which will ultimately improve their quality of life. Expressing his views, Senior Advisor to the President, Prof. Gomika Udugamasooriya stated: Up to now, research and development (RD) outcomes in Sri Lanka have not been effectively integrated into the economy. Under this new program, efforts will be directed towards commercializing RD, enabling economic growth and fostering social development to build a sustainable economy. The event was graced by a distinguished gathering, including Prime Minister Dr. Harini Amarasuriya, Ministers Sunil Handunnetti and Wasantha Samarasinghe, Professor Anil Jayantha Fernando and Professor Chrishantha Abeysena, Deputy Ministers Chathuranga Abeysinghe, Secretary to the President Dr. Nandika Sanath Kumanayake, Central Bank Governor Dr. Nandalal Weerasinghe, Senior Additional Secretary to the President Mr. Russel Apponsu, university vice-chancellors and representatives, heads of state and private research institutions, investors, entrepreneurs, industrialists, and senior executives from banks and financial institutions. --PMD",

        "date": "January 9, 2025 08:12 am",
        "content": "Raging wildfires surrounded Los Angeles on Wednesday, killing at least five people, destroying hundreds of homes and stretching firefighting resources and water supplies to the limit, as more than 100,000 people were ordered to evacuate. Fierce winds hindered firefighting operations and fueled the fires, which have burned unimpeded since they began on Tuesday. Five separate fires burned in Los Angeles County, all of them 0 contained according to state officials, including a pair of conflagrations that held the city in a pincer move. On the west side, the Palisades Fire consumed 15,832 acres (6,406 hectares) and 1,000 structures in the hills between Santa Monica and Malibu, racing down Topanga Canyon until reaching the natural fire break of the Pacific Ocean on Tuesday. It was already one of the most destructive fires in Los Angeles history. To the east, in the foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains, the Eaton Fire claimed another 10,600 acres (4,289 hectares) and killed at least five people, Los Angeles County Sheriff Robert Luna told KNX radio. Private forecaster AccuWeather estimated initial damage and economic loss at more than 50 billion. Were facing a historic natural disaster. And I think that cant be stated strong enough, Kevin McGowan, director of emergency management for Los Angeles County, told a press conference. The skies above Los Angeles glowed red in some areas and were blanketed by thick smoke. Nearly 1 million homes and businesses lost power in Los Angeles County, according to PowerOutage.us. The wind whipped up, the flames were up about 30 or 40 feet (9 to 12 meters) high, and you hear pop, pop, pop. It sounded like a warzone, Kevin Williams, an Eaton Fire evacuee, told Reuters at an evacuation center in Pasadena, describing gas canisters at his neighbors homes that began exploding under the heat of the flames. Water Woes Three smaller fires in the county also stretched firefighting resources that had already been exhausted, with water shortages affecting the Pacific Palisades, an upscale coastal enclave where a wildfire has consumed 15,832 acres (6,406 hectares). There are not enough firefighters in L.A. County to address four separate fires of this magnitude, said Los Angeles County Fire Chief Anthony Marrone. Demand for water also caused some hydrants to run dry in Pacific Palisades after the last of three large water tanks in the area hit empty, officials said. We pushed the system to the extreme. Were fighting a wildfire with urban water systems, and that is really challenging, Janisse Quinones, chief executive of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, told a press conference. Pacific Palisades relies on three tanks that hold about a million gallons (3.78 million liters) each, and the demand for water to fight fires at lower elevations was making it difficult to refill water tanks at higher elevations, she said. Some hydrants ran dry at around 3 a.m. With winds and smoke limiting the ability to offer air support, firefighters were left without enough water to battle the flames. Nestled in the hills with spectacular ocean views, Pacific Palisades is one of the most expensive neighborhoods in the country with a typical home valued at 3.7 million as of the end of 2023, according to Zillow, more than all but four other zip codes in the United States. It is also home to many film, television and music stars including Jamie Lee Curtis, Mandy Moore and Mark Hamill, all forced to flee their homes. The fires struck at an especially vulnerable time for Southern California, which has yet to see significant rainfall since the start of the water year in October. Then came the powerful Santa Ana winds, bringing dry desert air from the east toward the coastal mountains, fanning the flames of the wildfires while blowing over the hilltops and down through the canyons. Scientists said the fires, erupting well outside of the traditional wildfire season, mark the latest in weather extremes that are likely to escalate further as global temperatures continue to climb in coming decades. President Joe Biden, who stayed put in Los Angeles after Air Force One was grounded due to high winds on Tuesday, joined California Governor Gavin Newsom at a Santa Monica fire station to get a briefing firefighting efforts. The impacts of (the fires include) over one thousand structures already destroyed, a hundred-plus thousand people that have been evacuated, lives lost, traditions, lifestyles, places torn asunder, said Newsom, who declared a state of emergency on Tuesday. Biden pledged any help he could provide in his final days in office before handing off to President-elect Donald Trump on Jan. 20. Were doing anything and everything and as long as it takes to contain these fires ... to make sure you get back to normal, Biden said. Its going to be a hell of a long way. Its going to take time. Local officials warned that the gusty winds were forecast to persist throughout the day. We are absolutely not out of danger yet, with the strong winds that continue to push through the city and the county today, Los Angeles City Fire Chief Kristin Crowley said. As the flames spread and residents began evacuating after the fires broke out on Tuesday, roads were so jammed that some people abandoned their vehicles to escape the fire. Emergency responders were going door to door to press evacuation orders. Shaun Tate, 45, said he fled his home in Altadena, a Los Angeles suburb in the foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains, at 4:15 a.m. when he saw flames rolling towards his house. I came out of the house because I heard something fly off the roof, Tate said at an evacuation center in Pasadena. We packed up the SUV and drove down here, he said. I chose to save my laptop, my diabetic medication and a little bit of food. David Reed said he had no choice but to leave his Pacific Palisades home when police officers showed up at his door and laid down the law as he saw flames approaching his home. I grabbed my trombone and the latest book Ive been reading, which is my Jack Kerouac anthology here, because Im a beatnik, Reed said Source: Reuters --Agencies",
