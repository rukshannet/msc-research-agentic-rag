        "title": "Mourners begin days of funerals for Irans president and others killed in helicopter crash",
        "date": "May 21, 2024 03:49 pm",
        "content": "Mourners in black began gathering Tuesday for days of funerals and processions for Irans late president, foreign minister and others killed in a helicopter crash, a government-led series of ceremonies aimed at both honoring the dead and projecting strength in an unsettled Middle East. For Irans Shiite theocracy, mass demonstrations have been crucial since millions thronged the streets of Tehran to welcome Grand Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini in 1979 during the Islamic Revolution, and also attended his funeral 10 years later. An estimated 1 million turned out in 2020 for processions for the late Revolutionary Guard Gen. Qassem Soleimani, who was slain in a U.S. drone strike in Baghdad. Whether President Ebrahim Raisi, Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian and others draw the same crowd remains in question, particularly as Raisi died in a helicopter crash, won his office in the lowest-turnout presidential election in the countrys history and presided over sweeping crackdowns on all dissent. Prosecutors already have warned people over showing any public signs of celebrating his death and a heavy security force presence has been seen on the streets of Tehran since the crash. But Raisi, 63, had been discussed as a possible successor for Irans supreme leader, the 85-year-old Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. His death now throws that selection into question, particularly as there is no heir-apparent cleric for the presidency ahead of planned June 28 elections. Raisis death comes at a moment when the Islamist regime is consolidated, wrote Alex Vatanka, an Iran expert at the Middle East Institute. In short, there will be no power vacuum in Tehran; nonetheless, post-Khamenei Iran suddenly looks far less predictable than it did just a few days ago. A procession Tuesday morning led by a semitruck carrying the caskets of the dead slowly moved through the narrow streets of downtown Tabriz, the closest major city near the site of the crash Sunday. Thousands in black slowly walked beside the coffins, some throwing flowers up to them as an emcee wept through a loudspeaker for men he described as martyrs. The bodies will travel on to the holy Shiite seminary city of Qom before traveling to Tehran later Tuesday. On Wednesday, a funeral presided over by Khamenei will then turn into a procession as well. It remains unclear what international presence that funeral will draw, as Raisi faced U.S. sanctions for his part in mass executions in 1988 and for abuses targeting protesters and dissidents while leading the countrys judiciary. Iran under Raisi also shipped bomb-carrying drones to Russia to be used in its war on Ukraine. I dont feel comfortable sending condolences while Iran is sending drones that are used against civilians in Ukraine, wrote Lithuanian Foreign Minister Gabrielius Landsbergis on the social platform X. On Thursday, Raisis hometown of Birjand will see a procession, followed by a funeral and burial at the Imam Reza shrine in the holy city of Mashhad, the only imam of the Shiites faith buried in Iran. That shrine has long been a center for pilgrims and sees millions visit each year. Over the centuries, its grounds have served as the final burial site for heroes in Persian history. Its an incredibly high, rare honor in the faith. Iranian President Mohammad-Ali Rajai, the only other president to die in office when he was killed in a 1981 bombing, was buried in Tehran. Irans theocracy declared five days of mourning, encouraging people to attend the public mourning sessions. Typically, government employees and schoolchildren attend such events en masse, while others take part out of patriotism, curiosity or to witness historic events. Across Iran, its rural population often more closely embraces the Shiite faith and the government. However, Tehran has long held a far different view of Raisi and his governments policies as mass protests have roiled the capital for years. The most recent involved the 2022 death of Mahsa Amini, a woman detained over her allegedly loose headscarf, or hijab. The monthslong security crackdown that followed the demonstrations killed more than 500 people and saw over 22,000 detained. In March, a United Nations investigative panel found that Iran was responsible for the physical violence that led to Aminis death. Meanwhile, Irans rial currency has cratered after the collapse of Irans nuclear deal with world powers, destroying peoples savings and pensions. On Sunday night, as news of the helicopter crash circulated, some offered anti-government chants in the night. Fireworks could be seen in some parts of the capital, though Sunday also marked a remembrance for Imam Reza, which can see them set off as well. Critical messages and dark jokes over the crash also circulated online. Irans top prosecutor has already issued an order demanding cases be filed against those publishing false content, lies and insults against Raisi and others killed in the crash, according to the semiofficial ISNA news agency. No cause has yet been offered by Irans government for the crash, which took place in a foggy mountain range in a decadesold helicopter. Iranian presidents including hard-liner Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and Abolhasan Banisadr both survived their own helicopter crashes while in office. Irans military, not its civil aviation authority, will investigate and later offer a report, authorities say. Irans civil air crash investigators faced widespread international criticism over their reports on the downing of a Ukrainian passenger plane by an air defense battery in 2020 after Soleimanis killing. Meanwhile Tuesday, Irans new Assembly of Experts opened its first session after an election that decided the new assembly, a panel of which both Raisi and the late Tabriz Friday leader Mohammad Ali Ale-Heshem were members. A flower-ringed portrait sat on the seat Raisi would have occupied at the meeting of the 88-member panel, which is tasked with selecting the countrys next supreme leader. Also attending was Irans acting President Mohammad Mokhber. Source: The Associated Press --Agencies",

The funeral procession for late Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi and other officials who died in a helicopter crash started Tuesday in the northwestern city of Tabriz. Tens of thousands of Iranians, including senior officials and military commanders, gathered in the citys Martyrs Square to witness the funeral rites of the countrys late president and other officials who died in the incident. Their bodies will be flown later in the day to the central Iranian city of Qom, which is home to one of the revered shrines and religious seminaries where Raisi studied. Following the second funeral in Qom, they will be brought to the capital Tehran, where Irans Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei is expected to lead congregational funeral prayers for them. On Thursday, according to the itinerary, Raisi will be taken to his hometown of Mashhad for burial at the revered shrine of Imam Reza. Raisi, the 8th Iranian president since the 1979 Islamic Revolution, served as the custodian of the Imam Reza shrine for several years before becoming the countrys judiciary chief in 2019 and president in 2021. After a nightlong search operation hampered by bad weather, Raisi, Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, and other top officials were declared dead on Monday morning. Dozens of emergency rescue teams were dispatched to the mountainous area in East Azerbaijan province, where the accident occurred Sunday afternoon. According to the Iranian Constitution, First Vice President Mohammad Mokhber will assume powers of the presidency until new elections are held. --With Agencies Inputs",

        "date": "May 21, 2024 06:20 pm",
        "content": "(Reuters) - One passenger was killed and 30 injured after a Singapore Airlines flight from London hit severe turbulence en route on Tuesday, forcing it to make an emergency landing in Bangkok, officials and the airline said. Singapore Airlines offers its deepest condolences to the family of the deceased. We deeply apologise for the traumatic experience that our passengers and crew members suffered on this flight, the airline said, adding it was working with Thai authorities to provide all necessary assistance. One male passenger died, Kittipong Kittikachorn, Director of Bangkoks Suvarnabhumi airport, told Reuters. Eighteen people have been hospitalised and 12 are being treated in hospitals, Singapore Airlines said. It was not immediately possible to reconstruct the incident from publicly available tracking data, but a spokesperson for FlightRadar 24 said it was analysing data at around 07:49 GMT which shows the plane tilting upwards and return to its cruising altitude over the space of a minute. A passenger who was on the flight told Reuters that the incident involved the sensation of rising then falling. Suddenly the aircraft starts tilting up and there was shaking so I started bracing for what was happening, and very suddenly there was a very dramatic drop so everyone seated and not wearing a seatbelt was launched immediately into the ceiling, Dzafran Azmir, a 28-year-old student on board the flight told Reuters. Some people hit their heads on the baggage cabins overhead and dented it, they hit the places where lights and masks are and broke straight through it, he said. The spokesperson for FlightRadar 24 said with regard to data showing a drop in height, our initial thinking is the turbulence event is prior to the standard descent from 37,000 to 31,000 feet. That appears to just be a flight level change in preparation for landing. The Boeing 777-300ER plane with 211 passengers and 18 crew was headed to Singapore when it made the emergency landing, the airline said. Singapore news outlet CNA carried blurry pictures supplied by readers that it said appeared to be from the flight. They showed anxious passengers clinging to seats, with oxygen masks hanging from above, personal items strewn across the aisle and rubbish spilled on the floor of the cabin crew area. Suvarnabhumi airport said the plane requested an emergency landing at 3:35pm local time and landed at 3:51. Uninjured passengers disembarked and an another aircraft will fly them onwards. The airline said it landed at 3:45. TURBULENCE Turbulence-related airline accidents are the most common type, according to a 2021 study by the National Transportation Safety Board. From 2009 through 2018, the U.S. agency found that turbulence accounted for more than a third of reported airline accidents and most resulted in one or more serious injuries, but no aircraft damage. Singapore Airlines, which is widely recognized as one of worlds leading airlines and is a benchmark for much of the industry, has not had any major incidents in recent years. Its last accident resulting in casualties was a flight from Singapore to Los Angeles via Taipei, where it crashed on Oct. 31, 2000 into construction equipment on the Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport after attempting to take off from the wrong runway. The crash killed 83 of the 179 people on board. Singapore Airlines has had seven accidents according to records by the Aviation Safety Network. Boeing did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

        "content": "Young Sri Lankan fast bowler Matheesha Pathirana became the most expensive player ever in a Lanka Premier League (LPL) auction Tuesday when he was grabbed by Colombo Strikers for a record 120,000. The 21-year-old  who has an unorthodox slinging delivery style  broke the 92,000 mark set by Dilshan Madushanka in last years edition of the T20 tournament. Colombo Strikers bought Pathirana after matching Galle Marvels bid with their Right To Match option. In an interesting turn of events, the Dambulla franchise began the bidding at USD 70,000 after Matheesha Pahitrana entered the bidding at his base price of USD 50,000. However, Galle Marvels raised the stakes and took it to USD 100,000 straightaway. To avoid retention from Colombo Srikers, Galle even increased their own bid to USD 120,000 but their effort went in vain. Pathiranas price is nearly five times more than his Indian Premier League (IPL) price. The Sri Lanka fast bowler played for the Super Kings, becoming an IPL star during his three-year stint with the 5-time champion. Pathirana was roped in by CSK for INR 20 lakh as a replacement for New Zealands Adam Milne in 2022. Meanwhile, the second most expensive on Tuesdays LPL auction was all-rounder Isuru Udana who was taken for 100,000 by Galle Marvels, with Dasun Shanaka, another all-rounder, in third at 85,000.

        "title": "4 Sri Lankan ISIS terrorists arrested in India were planning major attack - report",
        "date": "May 21, 2024 09:38 pm",
        "content": "Four ISIS terrorists were arrested in Ahmedabad yesterday, days after the city airport received a bomb threat. The terrorists - believed to be Sri Lankan nationals - were arrested by the Gujarat Anti-Terrorism Squad after a tip-off. Giving details of the operation to arrest the four ISIS terrorists, police said multiple teams were formed after the officials received the information that the suspects were planning to travel to Ahmedabad to carry out terror attacks in India. Vikash Sahay, Director General of Police, Gujarat, said these four terrorists had boarded an IndiGo flight bound for Ahmedabad from Chennai yesterday. The arrests were made after checking the list of passengers coming from the Southern region and getting their identities confirmed by officials in Colombo, he said. Police said the four men had been in touch with a man named Abu in Pakistan through social media. Abu encouraged them to carry out a terror attack in India. They were so radicalised that they also agreed to suicide bombing. Pakistani resident Abu also gave them Rs. 4 lakh in Sri Lankan currency, Mr Sahay said. Police said after scanning their mobile phones, they found photographs of some weapons and location data of Nanachiloda near Ahmedabad. The ATS later recovered three Pakistani pistols and 20 cartridges, as indicated in the photographs, from Nanachiloda area, officials said. The weapons were arranged by their Pakistani handler, they said. They were also communicating with the ISIS leaders through Proton Mail, an end-to-end encrypted email service, officials said. Officials said the suspects - Mohammad Nusrat (33), Mohammad Farish (35), Mohammad Nafran (27) and Mohammad Rashdeen (43) - wanted to teach a lesson to Jews, Christians and the members of the BJP and RSS. Evidence showing their commitment to join ISIS and follow the path shown by former ISIS Chief Abu Bakr Baghdadi, they said. The Ahmedabad airport on May 12 received a bomb threat email which turned out to be a hoax after security personnel searched the airport complex, but nothing suspicious was found. Meanwhile, Sri Lankan intelligence agencies have launched a fresh probe into the ISIS activities on the island nation following the arrest of the four suspected ISIS terrorists, all natives of Sri Lanka, from the Ahmedabad airport. Sources said that Sri Lankas State Intelligence has requested for more details from their Indian counterparts to identify the background of arrested suspects in Ahmedabad and their alleged links to ISIS. Sri Lankas Public Security Minister Tiran Alles told the media that the countrys security agencies are taking the developments quite seriously and are closely monitoring the situation. We are working in close coordination with our Indian counterparts to ensure that all necessary measures are taken to address any potential threat, Alles told the media. Five years ago, a group of Islamic State bombers carried out a series of suicide attacks in Sri Lanka on Easter Sunday, killing 270 people, including 45 foreigners, and injuring over 500. Weeks before the coordinated bomb attacks on three churches and several hotels, the Indian intelligence agencies had alerted their Sri Lankan counterparts about the Islamic States plan to carry out such suicide missions. However, in a major security lapse, the Sri Lankan authorities ignored the warnings. They later admitted to receiving an intelligence brief from India about six terrorists planning a suicide attack on some important churches in the country. Source: NDTV  IANS --Agencies",

        "date": "May 21, 2024 10:23 pm",
        "content": "Acting Finance Minister Shehan Semasinghe announced plans to introduce two significant bills to Parliament on Wednesday (May 22), aimed at bolstering the countrys economy. These bills, the Economic Transformation Bill and the Public Financial Management Bill, are designed to enhance the management of public finances, thereby safeguarding against future economic downturns, he said. Minister Semasinghe made this announcement during a press conference at the Presidential Media Centre, themed Collective path to a stable country. Acting Finance Minister Shehan Semasinghe, further stated, The government has scheduled the submission of two significant bills crucial for the countrys economy on May 22. One of these bills is the Economic Transformation Law, aimed at preventing future economic collapses. Notably, this legislation stems from the vision of President Ranil Wickremesinghe, rather than being proposed by the International Monetary Fund. The recent stabilization of the economy following previous downturns underscores the importance of preserving this stability going forward. Additionally, it is necessary to maintain optimal levels of public financial management to avert future economic crises. The Public Finance Management Bill is set to be presented to Parliament on the same day, with a focus on enhancing accountability in managing public finances. This legislative initiative aligns with recommendations from a collaborative program with the International Monetary Fund and holds significant importance for the countrys future financial management. Its important to underscore the critical significance of both these bills for the countrys future. These drafts contain numerous technical intricacies aimed at bolstering confidence in the economy and maintaining the trajectory of the new economic direction implemented thus far. Further elaborating on the Economic Transformation Bill, it holds paramount importance for the countrys economic growth. Despite experiencing economic contraction in the second and third quarters of 2023, a notable growth rate of 4.5 was achieved in the fourth quarter. Consequently, the benefits of this economic upturn have started permeating to the grassroots level within the country. Furthermore, it is imperative to enhance the economic competitiveness of the nation and adapt the economy to confront global challenges while fostering international cooperation and growth. Additionally, this bill addresses necessary changes in various sectors. Specifically, the legislation encompasses reforms essential for international trade, trade agreements, and climate change mitigation efforts. The establishment of a new Economic Commission in Sri Lanka, aimed at attracting investments to enhance competitiveness, fostering a conducive environment for investors, expanding international trade, establishing the National Productivity Commission, and developing export-related institutions, is also outlined in this bill. Recently, Parliament endorsed the decisions made, particularly regarding economic transformation. In 2022, the public debt ratio stood at 128, a figure slated to be reduced to less than 95 by 2032. Similarly, the fiscal requirement, which was 34.6 of the gross domestic product in 2022, aims to be lowered to below 13 by 2032. Effective debt servicing is paramount, with efforts focused on establishing Sri Lanka as a debt-sustainable nation capable of meeting its obligations. The aim is to reduce the debt payment ratio from 9.4 in 2022 to below 4.5 by 2027. A proposed bill will outline specific national goals and actions taken to address economic challenges, providing a roadmap for sustainable economic growth, debt management, agricultural modernization, import-export regulation, and economic governance. Additionally, considerable attention has been given to the Public Finance Management Bill, aimed at identifying weaknesses in the current legislation and proposing a robust legal framework to meet future needs. --PMD",

        "content": "The government plans to initiate two pilot projects, the Temporary Agricultural Electric Fence and the Village Electric Fence, to protect villages and farmlands experiencing significant elephant-human conflicts. This announcement was made during a discussion held recently, led by Senior Advisor to the President on National Security and Chief of Presidential Staff Sagala Ratnayaka, alongside the heads of line agencies, focusing on recent measures to mitigate wild elephant-human conflicts, the PMD reported. In addition to the existing electric fences built and maintained to mitigate elephant-human conflicts, pilot projects have been initiated in several conflict-prone districts to protect farmlands within regional secretariats jurisdictions. These farmlands will be safeguarded only until the harvest season, with a focus on the construction of temporary agricultural electric fences (Agro Fences). Furthermore, there was an in-depth discussion about the pilot project for constructing electric fences (Village Fences) around villages that experience frequent human-wild elephant conflicts, aiming to protect these communities. Furthermore, it was decided during the discussion that the agricultural electric fence (Agro Fence) should be dismantled by the respective farmers after harvesting and that the Department of Agricultural Development would assume responsibility for its maintenance and custody. Maintenance duties will also be delegated to the respective divisional secretariats. Additionally, attention was given to the preservation of a group of trained elephants for cultural events and parades, besides addressing the issue of private elephant ownership. Mr. Sagala Ratnayaka further instructed the pertinent authorities to compile and present a comprehensive report outlining the challenges encountered in executing these resolutions for review by President Ranil Wickremesinghe. The meeting was attended by Gunadasa Samarasinghe, the Secretary of the Ministry of Wildlife and Forest Conservation, as well as representatives from various line agencies and members of the Wild Elephant Human Control Committee, including Dr. Sumith Pilapitiya and Dr. Prithiviraj Fernando. --PMD",

        "content": "Minister of State for Finance Ranjith Siyambalapitiya has said that new liquor licenses will be issued only based on factors such as the countrys population and tourist arrivals. He said this in response to questions from reporters about allegations that the government is working to transfer 55 of the 100 liquor licenses owned by Sathosa to other companies. Commenting further, the State Minister said: There has never been a time when taxes collected from liquor establishments were so carefully and systematically collected. Also, as alleged, we were not asked to issue liquor licenses belonging to Sathosa. I am also informed that the liquor license cannot be leased out to another person even if such requests are made. So, the government also aims to control the production of illegal liquor. Also, if liquor license is issued for a particular area, the opinion of the Divisional Secretary and Police must be sought. We will not take any action to grant liquor license to those areas at any time when reasonable objections arise. In 2003 alone, the price of alcohol increased by 108 due to the imposition of tax. The government is never going to increase the legal use of alcohol. We reject the allegations that the government is giving liquor licenses to its friends. Until now, the RB 04 permit given to liquor companies in the country, although no initial fee was charged at the time of issuing the license, it currently charges a fee of Rs. 15 million. The state minister also noted that the annual fee charged for all liquor licenses has been increased tenfold and accordingly the government is working to reduce the production of illicit alcohol and reduce the consumption of legal liquor.",

        "date": "May 22, 2024 09:50 am",
        "content": "State Minister for Social Empowerment Anupa Pasqual, emphasized that new laws are being introduced to facilitate the use of uncultivated land for agricultural purposes as land is vital for social empowerment. The state minister also announced that the government has decided to incorporate a skill or professional stream into the G.C.E. Ordinary Level Examination to promote social empowerment. The state minister made these remarks during a press briefing titled Collective Path to a Stable Country held at the Presidential Media Centre (PMC). Addressing the Media Personnel the state minister further said: A fundamental ideology we have advocated is the need for educational system reform to uplift society. Hence, individuals should not be labelled as exam failures solely due to struggles in subjects like maths, religion, or language at the G.C.E (OL) examination. Therefore, the government has resolved to integrate skill-based or vocational streams into the G.C.E (OL) Examination syllabus. This concept reflects societal acceptance. Accordingly, the Ministry of Education plans to implement this initiative from the beginning of next year. It is imperative to note that forthcoming educational reforms aim to cultivate skilled professionals. Furthermore, we have recognized numerous uncultivated lands across the country. These lands should be utilized for agricultural purposes. Land holds pivotal importance in social empowerment. Thus, endeavours are underway to enact new legislation facilitating the utilization of uncultivated but arable land. Our standard is that pensions should be given to all to empower the entire country. To achieve this, we propose a contributory pension scheme encompassing not only the public and private sectors but also all self-employed individuals. Simultaneously, we must devote ourselves to fostering an entrepreneurial culture within the country. Additionally, access to vocational education should be extended to all as part of our efforts to drive the country towards development. Furthermore, we have initiated the Liyasaviya program aimed at empowering preschool teachers. Our primary objective is to empower 1.2 million disadvantaged beneficiaries, with a target of empowering 300,000 families this year. Preparation of essential documentation for approximately 188,000 beneficiaries has been completed. Under the World Bank project, documentation for 10,000 beneficiaries and under the Asian Development Bank (ADB), documentation for 16,000 beneficiaries has been finalized. Training for officials will also conclude this month. Furthermore, several social empowerment initiatives will commence in collaboration with the National Youth Services Council, Coconut Development Board and Tea Small Holdings Development Authority, in the next month. We hope to create a productive economy through all these efforts. --PMD",

        "date": "May 22, 2024 02:17 pm",
        "content": "Norway, Ireland and Spain said Wednesday they are recognizing a Palestinian state in a historic move that drew condemnation from Israel and jubilation from the Palestinians. Israel immediately ordered back its ambassadors from Norway and Ireland. It was a lightning cascade of announcements. First was Norway, whose Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre said there cannot be peace in the Middle East if there is no recognition. Gahr Støre said the Scandinavian country will officially recognize a Palestinian state as of May 28. By recognizing a Palestinian state, Norway supports the Arab peace plan, he said. Several European Union countries have in the past weeks indicated that they plan to make the recognition, arguing a two-state solution is essential for lasting peace in the region. The decision may generate momentum for the recognition of a Palestinian state by other EU countries and could spur further steps at the United Nations, deepening Israels isolation. Norway, which is not a member of the European Union but mirror its moves, has been an ardent supporter of a two-state solution between Israel and the Palestinians. The terror has been committed by Hamas and militant groups who are not supporters of a two-state solution and the state of Israel, the Norwegian government leader said. Palestine has a fundamental right to an independent state. The move comes as Israeli forces have led assaults on the northern and southern edges of the Gaza Strip in May, causing a new exodus of hundreds of thousands of people, and sharply restricted the flow of aid, raising the risk of famine. The Scandinavian country will therefore regard Palestine as an independent state with all the rights and obligations that entails, Gahr Støre said. The development comes more than 30 years after the first Oslo agreement was signed in 1993. Since then, the Palestinians have taken important steps towards a two-state solution, the Norwegian government said. It said that the World Bank determined that a Palestinian state had met key criteria to function as a state in 2011, that national institutions have been built up to provide the population with important services. The war in Gaza and the constant expansion of illegal settlements in the West Bank still mean that the situation in Palestine is more difficult than it has been in decades, the Norwegian government said. Also Wednesday, Irish Prime Minister Simon Harris made his announcement, saying it was a move coordinated with Spain and Norway, an historic and important day for Ireland and for Palestine. He said the move was intended to help move the Israeli-Palestinian conflict to resolution through a two-state solution. Harris said he thinks other countries will join Norway, Spain and Ireland in recognizing a Palestinian state in the weeks ahead. Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez said that his country will recognize a Palestinian state also on May 28. Sánchez, Spains Socialist leader since 2018, made the expected announcement to the nations Parliament on Wednesday. Sánchez has spent months touring European and Middle Eastern countries to garner support for the recognition of a Palestinian state, as well as a possible ceasefire in Gaza. He has said several times that he was committed to the move. We know that this initiative wont bring back the past and the lives lost in Palestine, but we believe that it will give the Palestinians two things that are very important for their present and their future: dignity and hope, Sánchez said. This recognition is not against anyone, it is not against the Israeli people, Sánchez added, while acknowledging that it will most likely cause diplomatic tensions with Tel Aviv. It is an act in favor of peace, justice and moral consistency. Sánchez argued that the move is needed to support the viability of a two-state solution that he said is in serious danger with the war in Gaza. I have spent weeks and months speaking with leaders inside and outside of the region and if one thing is clear is that Prime Minister (Benjamin) Netanyahu does not have a project of peace for Palestine, even if the fight against the terrorist group Hamas is legitimate, the Spanish leader said. Earlier this month, Spains Foreign Minister José Albares said he had informed U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken of his governments intention to recognize a Palestinian state. The fast-moving developments drew Israels condemnation. Israels Foreign Minister Israel Katz ordered Israels ambassadors from Ireland and Norway to immediately return to Israel, as Norway said it would recognize a Palestinian state and Ireland was expected to do the same. Ireland and Norway intend to send a message today to the Palestinians and the whole world: terrorism pays, Katz said. He said that the recognition could impede efforts to return Israels hostages being held in Gaza and makes a cease-fire less likely by rewarding the jihadists of Hamas and Iran. He also threatened to recall Israels ambassador to Spain if the country takes a similar position. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas welcomed Norways recognition of a Palestinian state and called on other countries to follow. In a statement carried by the official Wafa news agency, Abbas said Norways decision will enshrine the Palestinian peoples right to self-determination and support efforts to bring about a two-state solution with Israel.

        "date": "May 22, 2024 09:56 pm",
        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe announced the implementation of a new program aimed at improving the living conditions of retired security forces members, the Presidents Media Division reported. The President highlighted that, in the absence of a dedicated program, some veterans have faced difficult situations. Consequently, the President has directed the State Minister of Defence, the Ministry of Defence, and the Ranaviru Seva Authority to give special attention to this matter. President Ranil Wickremesinghe made this statement today, (22), during the inauguration of the headquarters complex of the Sri Lanka Ex-Servicemens Association, also known as the Home of Veterans, located at Defence Ministry Avenue in Akuregoda, Battaramulla. The President emphasized the governments commitment to the welfare of retired war heroes, announcing that those residing in war hero villages will be granted free land rights under the Urumaya National Program. President Ranil Wickremesinghe also revealed plans to introduce Special Provisions for the Defence Act, legalize the National Defence Council, and establish the Armed Forces Committee. Additionally, he announced the establishment of the Sri Lanka Institute of Strategic Studies, which will offer opportunities for active service members, retirees, and civilians to study war tactics. During the inauguration of the Sri Lanka Ex-Servicemens Association headquarters complex, President Ranil Wickremesinghe unveiled the commemorative plaque and conducted an observation tour of the facility. To commemorate this event, Major General Upul Perera, President of the Sri Lanka Ex-Servicemens Association, presented a commemorative gift to the President. To support the welfare of retired war heroes from the three armed forces, the headquarters building was constructed with financial contributions from both the association and the armed forces. The association, established in 1944 by military personnel who retired at the end of the Second World War, spearheaded this initiative. Addressing the event, President Wickremesinghe further stated: This building has been constructed to support the activities of retired security forces members, many of whom made significant sacrifices to protect the countrys unity and territorial integrity from 1983 to 2009. The government is dedicated to addressing the challenges faced by the members of the Sri Lanka Ex-Servicemens Association and other retired government employees. While we currently face economic difficulties, we are confident in our ability to recover within the next two years. I learned that the war heroes living in the war hero villages have not yet received their land rights. Promises were made but not fulfilled. Therefore, a committee comprising the Presidents Secretary, the Additional Secretary of the Ministry of Defence, the Chairman of the Ranaviru Seva Authority, and the Land Commissioner has been appointed to complete this task within the next two months and issue freehold deeds to all under the Urumaya National Program. Consequently, we are confident that the work will be completed by July. Additionally, we have focused on the future of the armed forces and national security. A separate advisory committee has been appointed to develop the necessary security program through 2030. I anticipate receiving the report soon, after which everyone will have the opportunity to review and provide feedback. By 2030, we must be prepared to address emerging national security challenges. The responsibilities of the Tri-forces should be clearly defined and the countrys resources should be utilized according to a well-structured plan. I also intend to introduce the Special Protection Provisions Act. The establishment of the National Security Council, as highlighted in the Easter Sunday commission, is essential and will be legalized along with the appointment of the Armed Forces Committee. Additionally, we will establish the Sri Lanka Institute of Strategic Studies, which will offer military tactics education to those in the armed services, retirees, and civilians. Interested individuals can participate in these programs. This initiative will coincide with the on-going restructuring of the security forces. Its undeniable that retirees bore the brunt of the challenges during the recent difficult period. We need to explore what concessions can be offered to each sector. The current system of providing one pension per rank is already functioning. However, we are actively seeking input and suggestions regarding the welfare initiatives of this association and the Ranaviru Seva Authority. Efforts are underway to implement welfare programs through the Ranaviru Seva Authority. Weve also directed our attention towards those who are retiring from service. Its crucial for them to explore avenues for creating new sources of income. Regrettably, some have opted to seek opportunities in Russia due to the lack of opportunities domestically. Its imperative that individuals, according to their capabilities, are provided opportunities to earn a sustainable income, whether within the country or abroad. To address this, Ive instructed the State Minister of Defence, the Ministry of Defence, and the Ranaviru Seva Authority to collaborate on proposing a special program. Our retiring military personnel possess unique skills and talents. As the countrys economy continues to develop, its essential to offer them new avenues for growth. Today, we have the chance to foster economic development thanks to the sacrifices made by the war heroes of the past. Today, weve initiated this program following the cessation of yet another conflict. Terrorism posed a significant threat to our nations unity, alongside a profound economic downturn. If this trend persists, we risk facing a fate akin to that of Libyaa nation devoid of a functioning economy. Upon assuming office, my foremost priority was to fortify our economy. Decisions concerning the nations economic trajectory for the next 4 to 5 years needed to be expedited. Just as in times of war, where swift strategic action is imperative to achieve victory, we must adopt a similar approach in revitalizing our economy. Upon assuming leadership, my primary objective was to bolster the nations economy. Additionally, decisions pertaining to the countrys economic trajectory over the next 4 to 5 years needed to be promptly addressed. Just as in times of war, where prolonging conflict is deemed detrimental and strategic resolution (Shock treatment) is imperative, we must apply similar principles to both warfare and economic development. Our nation is currently experiencing economic recovery. Negotiations are underway with our creditors to secure full discharge from bankruptcy. The committee overseeing these discussions, along with China, is prepared to engage and accept our proposals, a move already endorsed by the International Monetary Fund. Subsequent agreements will be signed with these countries, while private creditors, banks, and pension funds are urged to negotiate and reach consensus, buoyed by the IMFs approval. Private creditors, banks, and pension funds are urged to engage in negotiations and reach agreements, facilitated by the endorsement of the International Monetary Fund. These discussions will progress once IMF representatives visit our country in June. Subsequently, the program will be integrated into the 2025 budget, slated for presentation in January or February amid on-going elections. The economic growth resulting from these initiatives holds promise for enhancing peoples income. I extend my gratitude to all retirees for their steadfast efforts and wish the Ex-Servicemen a prosperous future. The event was attended by State Minister of Defence Pramitha Bandara Thennakoon, Senior Advisor to the President on National Security and Chief of Presidential Staff Sagala Ratnayaka, Secretary of Defence Ministry General Kamal Gunaratne (Retired), Chief of Defence Staff General Shavendra Silva, Army Commander Lt. Gen. Vikum Liyanage, Navy Commander Vice Admiral Priyantha Perera, Air Force Commander Air Marshal Udeni Rajapaksa, and other distinguished guests, including members of the Sri Lanka Ex-Servicemens Association. --PMD",

        "date": "May 22, 2024 10:34 pm",
        "content": "State Minister for Urban Development and Housing, Arundika Fernando, announced that state enterprises are now open to private sector investments, but only at the governments assessed value. This directive aligns with President Ranil Wickremesinghes instruction that state enterprises should not be offered for private sector investments below their assessed value. State Minister Fernando highlighted the revival of regional development projects that were previously halted due to economic difficulties. He made these remarks at a press briefing held at the Presidential Media Centre today (22), under the theme Collective Path to a Stable Country. Expressing his views further he said The government has granted authorization to seek investors for various enterprises falling under the purview of the Ministry of Urban Development and Housing, with the aim of ensuring their systematic maintenance. This move is anticipated to facilitate transparent investment procedures for establishments like the Hilton Hotel, ultimately strengthening the financial reserves of the government, distributing shares among employees, and fostering orderly management of these entities. It is expected to exceed the governments assessed value through these investments. President Ranil Wickremesinghe has directed not to offer state enterprises in private sector investments below their assessed value. Accordingly, there is no room for any private investor to acquire state enterprises below the governments appraisal value. Additionally, Sri Lankan Airlines is burdened with a substantial debt. Even if the government shoulders a portion of it, any investor interested in the airline must possess the financial strength to manage the remaining debt. Furthermore, valuable government land has been allocated for projects such as the Colombo Hyatt Hotel, Chris, and Destiny. Regrettably, the investors involved in these ventures have left them. Presently, the Krrish project stands as a lingering environmental issue, characterized by a derelict building. Moreover, USD 60 million has been allocated to the Colombo Hyatt Hotel project, primarily sourced from public funds. Additionally, there remains a debt of USD 35 million associated with this project. The development has utilized a significant plot of land in Colombo. If an appropriate investor does not emerge, we are prepared to proceed with completion with the assistance of the armed forces, with financing from the treasury. In addition, we are optimistic about a significant increase in foreign investment into the country in the coming months. In a remarkable turnaround from recent economic challenges, the country has experienced a surge in foreign reserves. The funds have been allocated to resume stalled regional development projects. Under the Presidents economic agenda, funding for the Aswasuma Social Welfare Benefit Program has tripled compared to Samurdhi. Additionally, the Urumaya program, designed to provide free land deeds for licensed lands, has been swiftly implemented, empowering communities. These bold initiatives highlight the governments proactive approach in driving the country towards prosperity. --PMD",

Presidents Vesak Message 2024: The Vesak festival is a profoundly sacred day for Buddhists worldwide, commemorating the Buddhas birth, enlightenment, and passing. Buddhists in Sri Lanka, along with their brethren around the globe, celebrate Vesak with deep devotion.

He also mentioned that although the middle path taught in Buddhism is an eternal concept, it is relevant present day society and that the middle path is also meaningful in economic planning and development. Prime Ministers Vesak Message; Vesak Poya day is the most sacred day to the Buddhist people who celebrate the birth, enlightenment and the mahaparinibbana of the Buddha. Since ancient times, Sri Lankans celebrate it with boundless joy of venerating the Buddha. After a difficult period due to natural calamities, pandemic and economic downturn, Sri Lankan people have the opportunity to celebrate the Vesak festival in a grand scale this year. The nature of the world is changing day by day. At present, the ways of life that were expected by us in the past are collapsing. Because of this, we are entering a period where many people around the world are travelling to Buddhist countries to find the essence of Buddhism, which explains the nature of life. The Buddhist teachings advocate the middle path for salvation. Although the middle path is an eternal concept, it is relevant present day society. The middle path is also meaningful in economic planning and development. The middle way provides eternal peace and contentment. Throughout a long history, Vesak decoration has been a deep spiritual exercise that highlights the impermanence of life. Vesak decoration helps children to understand through experience that life leads to destruction unless it is well balanced. It is the duty of all adults to provide the necessary facilities and make the environment for children to understand life through experience of Vesak decorations. That also helps to preserve Vesak art. Let us work in a society that is guided by the four sublime status of Metta (Kindness), Karuna (Compassion), Mudita (Sympathetic Joy), and Upeksha (Equanimity) as outlined by the noble Buddhist philosophy.

        "date": "May 23, 2024 02:30 pm",
        "content": "A stage collapsed at a Mexican election campaign rally on Wednesday, killing nine people and injuring dozens as high winds tore apart the large, concert-style structure, scattering politicians and attendees. Around 50 people were injured at the rally for the Citizens Movement party in the northern Mexican state of Nuevo Leon, Samuel Garcia, the states governor, said on social media. The victims were eight adults and one child, Garcia said, adding he was headed to a hospital where three people were in surgery. Many of the injured were being treated at local clinics, the director of Mexicos social security institute reported. Jorge Alvarez Maynez, the presidential candidate for the centrist Citizens Movement party, said a gust of wind caused the stage to collapse at the event in the city of San Pedro Garza Garcia, a wealthy enclave near the industrial hub of Monterrey. Video of the accident showed the structure suddenly falling forward into the crowd, sending politicians on the stage and panicked attendees running for cover. Ive never experienced something so sudden, Alvarez Maynez told reporters, referring to how quickly the wind picked up before the stage collapsed. Alvarez Maynez, who returned to the scene of the accident after being cleared at a local hospital, said he was suspending campaign activities and that he hoped authorities investigate what occurred, requesting transparency in the process. Alvarez Maynezs campaign coordinator Laura Ballesteros was hospitalized with a broken foot, according to the party, and mayoral candidate for San Pedro Garza Garcia, Lorenia Canavati, wrote on social media that she was coordinating with authorities to support those impacted and their families. Members of Mexicos national guard and army were on the scene to provide support, Interior Minister Luisa Alcalde said on social media. Governor Garcia warned residents to stay indoors amid strong thunderstorms in the area. Alvarez Maynez is polling in third place in Mexicos presidential election set for June 2. He is trailing far behind ruling party candidate Claudia Sheinbaum and second-place Xochitl Galvez, who represents a broad opposition coalition. Galvez and Sheinbaum both offered condolences for the families of the victims in posts on social media, with Sheinbaum canceling a rally planned for Thursday evening in Monterrey.

        "content": "Caller ID company Truecaller will let users create an AI version of their voice to answer calls. Truecaller is an app that identifies and blocks spam calls that some people prefer over their phones default system. Now the service will let users with access to its AI Assistant to record their voice. The company partnered with Microsofts Azure AI Speech, which will learn from the recorded clip to generate an AI version of the users voice. This groundbreaking capability not only adds a touch of familiarity and comfort for the users but also showcases the power of AI in transforming the way we interact with our digital assistants, says Truecaller product director and general manager Raphael Mimoun in the blog post. Truecallers AI Assistant screens incoming calls and lets users know why they are calling. Customers can see the reason for the call and can choose how to respond, either by picking up the phone or having the assistant answer for them. The Assistant, only available in select countries, was first introduced on the Truecaller app in 2022. Users have always been able to choose from a preset number of voices to represent them, and the company says letting users record their own voices is a step in personalizing the service even more. Azure AI Speech, showcased during the Build conference, added a personal voice feature that lets people record and replicate voices. Microsoft says in a blog post, however, that personal voice is available on a limited basis and only for specific use cases like voice assistants. Microsoft says it automatically adds watermarks to voices generated by Azure AI Speechs personal voice. It also released a code of conduct requiring users to get the full consent of people being recorded and prohibit impersonation. It remains to be seen how well personal voice will perform against your own voicemail message. Source: The Verge --Agencies",

        "date": "May 23, 2024 10:01 pm",
        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe underscored the significance of Theravada Buddhism in addressing the challenges posed by a world rapidly advancing in science and technology. Speaking at the State Vesak Ceremony held at the Dharmaraja Piriven Viharaya in Matale virtually this morning (23), President Wickremesinghe stressed the importance of preserving the true essence of Theravada Buddhism and sharing its wisdom with the world. Although President Wickremesinghe was scheduled to participate in the State Vesak Ceremony in person, adverse weather conditions prevented his attendance. Instead, he joined the State Vesak Ceremony virtually and extended his wishes to all Buddhists for a meaningful Vesak celebration. The State Vesak Festival this year is being held centring the Matale district, under the theme Attano wa avekkhyeya kathani akatani cha (Lets Focus on What We Have Done, Not What Others Have Done). The period from May 21st to 27th has been declared Vesak Week. This years festival is particularly special as Buddhist monks from 12 countries have arrived to participate in the State Vesak Festival, emphasizing the global significance and unity in celebrating this sacred event. During the ceremony, Pooja Bhumi Scroll Memorandums were presented and gifts were exchanged by foreign delegations. Additionally, several significant actions were undertaken, including the issuance of a Vesak commemorative stamp, providing grants for temple development, providing grants from the Buddhasasana Fund, providing provision letters for Dhamma schools, symbolic distribution of book sets for lay monks and the distribution of Budu Puth Maapiya grant cheques. A total of Rs. 22 million has been allocated for the development of 22 rural Buddhist temples in the Matale district. Additionally, Rs. 2.6 million has been earmarked for the development of 5 temples where programs are held in conjunction with the State Vesak festival. Another Rs. 0.4 million has been allocated for the reconstruction of 3 temples affected by disasters. Furthermore, Rs. 5 million has been dedicated to the development of 12 Dhamma schools. Under the Buddhasasana Fund, Rs. 32 million has been allotted to provide sanitary facilities for 32 challenging temples. Simultaneously, development efforts for over 25 temples in the district have commenced with labour contributions from the Armed Forces and the Civil Defence Force. The State Vesak festival has been orchestrated by the Samastha Lanka Shasanarakshaka Mandalaya, the Ministry of Buddhasasana, Religious and Cultural Affairs, the Department of Buddhist Affairs and the Matale District Secretariat. Addressing the gathering virtually, President Ranil Wickremesinghe further said; I regret being unable to attend the national Vesak festival, which is being held this year in the Matale district, due to adverse weather conditions. Its important to note that the Matale district holds significance in Theravada Buddhism. The transcription of the Sacred Tripitaka occurred at Alu Viharaya in Matale, which has played a vital role in preserving Buddhas teachings. Therefore, we should give more consideration to Theravada Buddhism. Not only did the Maha Sangha originate from the pirivena that existed in the Anuradhapura era, but scholars such as Senarath Paranavithana also believed that the inception of Sri Lankas most significant irrigation system was made possible through Piriven education. Today, the world is progressively moving away from superstition, directing increased focus towards science. The advent of new technologies is fundamentally reshaping our way of life, which has remained relatively unchanged for centuries. Notably, significant advancements have occurred in the medical and technological sectors. However, alongside the development of new knowledge about the cosmos and the rapid progress in artificial intelligence technology, we are confronted with several emerging challenges. Indeed, for those who adhere to Theravada Buddhism and comprehend its authentic essence, these challenges may not pose insurmountable obstacles. Theravada Buddhism offers a framework through which such issues can be addressed and resolved. Therefore, it is imperative that we concentrate our efforts on safeguarding and perpetuating the genuine spirit of Theravada Buddhism. Wishing everyone a joyous and meaningful Vesak celebration. The event was graced by the presence of Maha Sangha including the Chairman of the Samastha Lanka Shasanarakshaka Mandalaya Ven. Thunmulle Seelakkanda Thera and the Registrar Ven. Mugunawela Anuruddha Threa, Minister of Buddhasasana, Religious and Cultural Affairs Vidura Wickramanayake, State Ministers Pramita Bandara Thennako and Rohana Dissanayake, Governor of the Central Province Advocate Lalith U. Gamage, Members of Parliament Nalaka Kottegoda and Udayana Kirindigoda, Chief of Defence Staff General Shavendra Silva, Army Commander Lt. Gen. Vikum Liyanage and other dignitaries. --PMD--",

        "date": "May 24, 2024 01:03 pm",
        "content": "Scientists at the University of Warwick say they have been part of an international team to discover a new habitable Earth-sized planet. Working with Nasa and the European Space Agency (ESA), they say Gliese 12 b has the same temperature as the 2022 UK heatwave and is one of the few known rocky planets where humans could theoretically survive. But the planets distance of 40 lights years away means it is too far away to experience more closely, the university said. Warwick astrophysicist Dr Thomas Wilson said: This is a really exciting discovery and will help our research into planets similar to Earth across our galaxy. The planet has an estimated surface temperature of about 42C, but the scientists said they were still unsure of what, if any, its atmosphere was like. It orbits its version of the sun every 12.8 days and is a similar size to Earth. The planets equivalent of the Sun, called Gliese 12, is a cool, red dwarf located in the constellation Pisces and the planet receives 1.6 times more energy from its star as Earth does from the sun, the university said. The team used data from Nasa and ESAs satellites to confirm the planets existence and characteristics like its size, temperature and distance away from Earth. Thrillingly, this planet is the closest Earth-sized and temperature planet we know, Dr Wilson added. The light we are seeing now is from 1984 40 years ago  thats how long it has taken to reach us here on Earth. Planets like Gliese 12 b are very few and far between, so for us to be able to examine one this closely and learn about its atmosphere and temperature is very rare. Larissa Palethorpe, co-lead of the study and doctoral student at the University of Edinburgh and University College London, said it was a unique candidate for further atmospheric study to help unlock some aspects of our own solar systems evolution. Earth remains habitable, but Venus does not due to its complete loss of water. Gliese 12 bs atmosphere could teach us a lot about the habitability pathways planets take as they develop, she added.

        "date": "May 24, 2024 04:04 pm",
        "content": "Hundreds are feared dead after a massive landslide flattened dozens of homes and buried families alive in a remote village in northern Papua New Guinea (PNG) early on Friday, a resident said. More than 50 homes, many with people still asleep inside, were buried when the landslide hit Kaokalam village around 3 a.m., villager Ninga Role told Reuters by phone. The death toll was nearly 300, among them his brother and cousin, he said. The Australian Broadcasting Corp and other local media reported that more than 100 people had been killed. One man who turned back to try to save his two children was buried along with his extended family, Role said. Social media footage posted by Role showed people clambering over rocks, uprooted trees and mounds of dirt searching for survivors. Women can be heard weeping in the background. Its very impossible, the area covered by the landslide is large and there are rocks and trees everywhere, Role said. Its very difficult to get them out. The village is in Enga province, about 600 km (370 miles) north of the capital Port Moresby. Prime Minister James Marape said in a statement he had yet to be fully briefed but that authorities were responding to the disaster. We are sending in disaster officials, PNG Defence Force, and the Department of Works and Highways to meet provincial and district officials in Enga and also start relief work, recovery of bodies, and reconstruction of infrastructure, Marape said. I will release further information as I am fully briefed on the scale of destruction and loss of lives. PNG police did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The landslide hit a section of highway near the Porgera gold mine, operated by Barrick Gold (ABX.TO), opens new tab through Barrick Niugini Ltd, its joint venture with Chinas Zijin Mining (601899.SS), opens new tab. A spokesperson said it was too soon to know whether there had been any damage to the mine, which had enough supplies to operate normally in the short term. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "title": "UNs top court orders Israel to halt military offensive in Rafah",
        "date": "May 24, 2024 07:28 pm",
        "content": "The top United Nations court ordered Israel on Friday to immediately halt its military operations in the southern Gaza city of Rafah  but stopped short of ordering a full cease-fire. While Israel is unlikely to comply with the order, it will ratchet up the pressure on the increasingly isolated country. Criticism of Israels conduct in the war in Gaza has been growing, particularly on operations in Rafah  and even from its closest ally, the United States. This week alone, three European countries announced they would recognize a Palestinian state, and the chief prosecutor for another U.N. court requested arrest warrants for Israeli leaders, along with Hamas officials. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is also under heavy pressure at home to end the war, which was triggered when Hamas-led militants stormed into Israel, killing 1,200 people, most civilians, and taking some 250 captive. Thousands of Israelis have joined weekly demonstrations calling on the government to reach a deal to bring the hostages home, fearing that time is running out. While the ruling by the International Court of Justice is a blow to Israels international standing, the court does not have a police force to enforce its orders. In another case on its docket, Russia has so far ignored a 2022 order by the court to halt its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Ahead of the ruling, Israel signaled it, too, would brush off an ICJ order to stop its operations. No power on earth will stop Israel from protecting its citizens and going after Hamas in Gaza, Avi Hyman, the government spokesperson, said in a press briefing Thursday. The courts president, Nawaf Salam, read out the ruling, as a small group of pro-Palestinian protesters demonstrated outside. Fears about an operation in Rafah have materialized, the ruling said, and the humanitarian situation is now to be characterized as disastrous. The court also ordered Israel to keep the Rafah crossing into Egypt open for unhindered provision at scale of urgently needed basic services and humanitarian assistance. The court did not call for a full cease-fire throughout Gaza as South Africa, which brought the case, had requested at hearings last week. The cease-fire request is part of a case filed late last year, accusing Israel of committing genocide during its Gaza campaign. Israel vehemently denies the allegations. The case will take years to resolve, but South Africa wants interim orders to protect Palestinians while the legal wrangling continues. The court ruled Friday that Israel must ensure access for any fact-finding or investigative mission sent by the United Nations to investigate the genocide allegations. At public hearings last week at the International Court of Justice, South Africas ambassador to the Netherlands, Vusimuzi Madonsela, urged the panel of 15 international judges to order Israel to totally and unconditionally withdraw from the Gaza Strip. The court has already found that Israels military operations pose a real and imminent risk to the Palestinian people in Gaza. Israels offensive has killed more than 35,000 Palestinians, according to Gazas Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians. The operation has obliterated entire neighborhoods, sent hundreds of thousands of people fleeing their homes, and pushed parts of the territory into famine. This may well be the last chance for the court to act, Irish lawyer Blinne Ní Ghrálaigh, who is part of South Africas legal team, told judges last week. Israel rejects the claims by South Africa, a nation with historic ties to the Palestinian people. Israel takes extraordinary measures in order to minimize the harm to civilians in Gaza, Tamar Kaplan-Tourgeman, a member of Israels legal team, told the court last week. In January, ICJ judges ordered Israel to do all it can to prevent death, destruction and any acts of genocide in Gaza, but the panel stopped short of ordering an end to the military offensive. In a second order in March, the court said Israel must take measures to improve the humanitarian situation. The ICJ rules in disputes between nations. A few kilometers (miles) away, the International Criminal Court files charges against individuals it considers most responsible for war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide. On Monday, its chief prosecutor, Karim Khan, said he has asked ICC judges to approve arrest warrants for Netanyahu, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant and three top Hamas leaders  Yahya Sinwar, Mohammed Deif and Ismail Haniyeh  of war crimes and crimes against humanity in the Gaza Strip and Israel. Israel is not an ICC member, so even if the arrest warrants are issued, Netanyahu and Gallant do not face any immediate risk of prosecution. But the threat of arrest could make it difficult for the Israeli leaders to travel abroad. Source: The Associated Press --Agencies",

        "content": "The Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) states that in order to implement the actions under its Financial Literacy Roadmap for the country, it plans to use the current network systems of government offices to create and deliver financial-related content to targeted audience, which are the youth and women. The regulator said that before implementing the programme, the current network will be analysed and modified to be effective in delivering financial literacy. The CBSL recently launched its publication, Financial Literacy Roadmap of Sri Lanka 20242028,. The roadmap has been developed as part of the Financial Literacy and Capacity Building pillar of the National Financial Inclusion Strategy. In its initiative to increase financial literacy under the National Financial Inclusion Strategy, the Central Bank said it expects to create synergies among stakeholders and exciting Financial Literacy Service providers, allowing them to work together and maximise the impact while ensuring effective resource allocation. Under the four-pillar action plan of the Central Bank, the regulator said under the first step will mostly consist of actions designed under the effective coordination and Harmonised Content Strategic Priority. Also, the CBSL said that the existing financial literacy stakeholders, such as regional offices of the CBSL, the community health network of the MoH, short message services used by RFSPs (Regulated Financial Service Providers), and educational institutes, have well-established networks used for day-to-day operations that can be used in delivering financial literacy content to targeted audiences. The CBSL will bring in modifications to the existing networks before implementing the interventions in order to use them as financial literacy delivery channels under the roadmap. The regulator further said that a framework is already in place to ensure the success of the roadmap, however, in order to make this national effort a success, high-level support from all national-level stakeholders is required.",

        "date": "May 25, 2024 02:27 pm",
        "content": "Lobbying groups representing airlines, hotels and retailers have urged European Union tech regulators to ensure that Google takes their views into account, and not just large intermediaries, when making changes to comply with landmark tech rules. Airlines for Europe group that has Air France KLM and British Airways owner IAG as members, hotel group Hotrec, European Hotel Forum, EuroCommerce, Ecommerce Europe and Independent Retail Europe had in March expressed their concerns about the impact of the new rules. EUs Digital Markets Act (DMA) imposes a list of dos and donts on Google and five other tech giants aimed at giving users more choice and rivals a better chance to compete, but the groups voiced concerns the the adjustments could hurt their revenues. In a joint letter to EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager and EU industry chief Thierry Breton dated May 22 they said their worries have mounted since then. Our industries have serious concerns that currently considered solutions and requirements for implementing the DMA could further increase discrimination, they wrote. Initial observations indicate that these changes risk severely depleting direct sales revenues of companies by giving more prominence to powerful online intermediaries due to the preferential treatment they would receive, they said. The Commission, which is now investigating Google for possible DMA breaches, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Google, which in a March blog post said changes to search results give large intermediaries and aggregators more traffic and less for hotels, airlines, merchants and restaurants, had no immediate comment. We are concerned that the non-compliance investigation refers only to the need to treat third-party services in a fair and non-discriminatory manner, without any acknowledgement of European businesses that also offer their services on Google, the groups said.

        "date": "May 25, 2024 02:40 pm",
        "content": "Kabosu, the dog behind the doge meme, has died after 14 years of internet fame, her owner has said. The Japanese shiba inu inspired a generation of online jokes and became the face of Dogecoin cryptocurrency. She had been suffering from leukaemia and liver disease and died on 24 May. She quietly passed away as if asleep while I caressed her, Atsuko Sato wrote on her blog, thanking Kabosus fans. I think Kabo-chan was the happiest dog in the world. And I was the happiest owner. As a rescue dog, Kabosus real birthday was unknown, but Ms Sato estimated her age at 18. In 2010, two years after adopting Kabosu from a puppy mill where she would otherwise have been put down, Ms Sato, a teacher from Sakura, east of Tokyo, took a picture of her pet crossing her paws on the sofa. She posted the image on her blog, from where it spread to online forum Reddit and became a meme that bounced from college bedrooms to office email chains. The memes typically used goofy broken English to reveal the inner thoughts of Kabosu and other shiba inu doge - pronounced like pizza dough but with a j at the end. The picture also later became an NFT digital artwork that sold for 4m (3.1m) and inspired Dogecoin, which was started as a joke by two software engineers and is now the eighth-most valuable cryptocurrency, with a market capitalisation of 23bn. Dogecoin has been backed by hip-hop star Snoop Dogg and Kiss bassist Gene Simmons. But its most keen supporter is billionaire Elon Musk, who jokes about the currency on X - sending its value soaring - and hails it as the peoples crypto. Kabosu fell ill with leukaemia and liver disease in late 2022, and Ms Sato said in a recent interview with AFP that the invisible power of prayers from fans worldwide helped her pull through. Ms Sato, 62, said she had become so used to unbelievable events that when Mr Musk changed the icon for Twitter, now X, to Kabosus face last year, she wasnt even that surprised. A 100,000 statue of Kabosu and her sofa crowdfunded by Own The Doge, a crypto organisation dedicated to the meme, was unveiled in a park in Sakura in November last year. Sato and Own The Doge have also donated large sums to international charities, including more than 1m to Save the Children. The NGO says it is the single largest crypto contribution it has ever received. Source: BBC --Agencies",

        "date": "May 25, 2024 02:58 pm",
        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe emphasized the confirmation of land rights for the people, ensuring avenues for progress. The President highlighted Sri Lankas unique status as the sole South Asian nation offering free land rights to its citizens. Encouraging recipients to safeguard the freehold deeds from the Heritage program for future generations, he made these remarks during todays (24) ceremony, where land deeds were bestowed upon the residents of the Jaffna district. A total of 1286 freehold deeds, encompassing all 15 Divisional Secretariat divisions within the Jaffna district, were distributed to the people, with the President symbolically participating in the awarding ceremony. Furthermore, under the Urumaya program, 13,858 freehold deeds are scheduled for distribution across the Mullaitivu, Kilinochchi, Vavuniya, and Mannar districts of the Northern Province. During his address at the ceremony, President Ranil Wickremesinghe announced the revival of the Northern Province housing project, stalled by the recent economic downturn, commencing next year. He highlighted this free land title initiative as a crucial step, alongside noting the Urumaya program as the nations largest privatization endeavour. President Ranil Wickremesinghe, elaborating further, also emphasized the initiation of a program aimed at providing free land rights to the nations people. Our objective is to extend this initiative across all regions of the island, ensuring every individual is liberated and granted land rights in their respective areas of residence. While todays distribution of deeds marks a significant milestone, our commitment extends to future endeavours. Recognizing the staffing constraints within the Land Commissioners Department, which have led to some delays, I have authorized the recruitment of 100 new personnel for the Land Commissioners Office and 150 for the Surveying Department. This strategic augmentation will enable us to execute this program with utmost efficiency moving forward. The land issue has disproportionately impacted the Northern and Eastern Provinces, affecting not only those settled on government lands but also individuals who lost their land during the conflict. There are two critical issues requiring resolution, as discussed with representatives from the North and East regions on numerous occasions. In collaboration with the security forces, all lands within protected areas have been released and restored to the public. Furthermore, instructions have been issued to the security forces to retain only the necessary land and return the surplus to civilian use. Addressing the matter of land acquired from the Forestry Department, this issue extends beyond the North East, encompassing the Southern Province as well. As a policy decision, we have opted to classify areas identified as forests in the 1985 map as such, while considering the remaining lands as non-forest areas. Discussions are underway, and directives have been issued to relinquish certain lands. Significant portions of land are also under the control of the Department of Archaeology. The government has resolved to return these lands, excluding those essential for archaeological endeavours. Hence, efforts are underway to facilitate the release of all such lands. Furthermore, there has been a substantial reduction in the size of the high-security zone in Jaffna. The Ministry of Defence has opted to release additional lands following a specialized survey. Moreover, a portion of the land belonging to religious sites within the high-security zone has already been relinquished. These measures are aimed at affirming the land rights of all citizens and fostering avenues for progress. Additionally, owing to the economic challenges of the past two years, the residents of this province have faced difficulties in securing funds for much-needed housing construction. However, I am pleased to announce that this initiative will resume next year. Its worth noting that the distribution of these free deeds is part of this program. The allocation of freehold deeds can be regarded as the largest privatization effort in our nation. While countries like Japan and Korea have not granted free land rights to their citizens, opting instead for subsidized purchasing options, our country is committed to providing free land rights. This distinction underscores our dedication to empowering our people through land ownership. We have successfully executed this program spanning from Point Pedro to Dewundara Thuduwa and from Batticaloa to Negombo. The people of Sri Lanka, irrespective of their ethnicity or faith, have historically cherished land ownership. Today, you have been granted that privilege. I urge you to recognize the importance of safeguarding this land and ensuring its transmission to future generations. In attendance at this event were Minister Douglas Devananda, Members of Parliament Dharmalingam Siddharan and M A Sumanthiran, PC, Northern Province Governor P S M Charles, Former Member of Parliament Vijayakala Maheswaran, Jaffna District Secretary Maradalingam Prathipan, Senior Additional Secretary to the President Chandra Herath, and various other dignitaries. --PMD--",

        "date": "May 25, 2024 05:38 pm",
        "content": "A 40-year-old illegal immigrant from Sri Lanka who allegedly ran a fake government identity proof racket for eight years has finally been caught in India. CCB sleuths of India recovered a country-made pistol from the man accused of being involved in making fake Aadhaar cards, driving licences, debitcredit cards and bank account papers. Hours after his arrest, his wife and her three daughters were caught attempting to flee the country using Indian passports, when she mistakenly provided her Sri Lankan identity proof during frisking by immigration officials at the airport. A senior police officer identified the racketeer as Sharan Kumar Kalidas alias Umesh Bala Ravindran alias Choti Bin Bala, a resident of an apartment in Rachenahalli, north Bengaluru, India. Acting on tipoff on May 20 about his alleged illegal activities, CCB inspector Kavitha GM and her team camped near his apartment complex and stopped him as arrived in his car. On questioning, Kalidas initially claimed he was from Mayiladuthurai in Tamil Nadu but did give satisfactory answers when asked about his profession. He told police that he came to Bengaluru in 2016 and lived in an apartment on Kanakapura Road. In 2018, he shifted to Vijayanagar, and in 2019, he stayed in an apartment on Thanisandra Main Road. He said he brought his wife and three children in 2021 and stayed in the Rachenahalli apartment. Upon checking his car, the police found some gadgets. Confronted with them, he confessed that he was a Sri Lankan national and came to Chennai illegally. He admitted being involved in a racket in making fake debit and credit cards, and other documents. Caught by Chennai police, he was deported to Sri Lanka but managed to return to India illegally and settled in Bengaluru in 2016. Kalidas confessed that he made fake documents to earn quick money and lead a lavish life. He also had several fake documents that gave him multiple identities. When police checked on his car, they were shocked to find a loaded country-made pistol. They also found three mobiles, including an iPhone, a MacBook, a defunct card reader, a weighing machine, four driving licence cards printed on one side, a debit card, five empty debit cards including chips, and two micro-SIM adaptors. A senior police officer said Kalidas was taken into custody and further investigation was handed over to Sampigehalli police who registered a case under Foreigners Act, Arms Act, and IPC section 420 (cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property).

He further assured the passing of the Gender Equality Bill before the end of June, expressing hope for unanimous support from Parliamentarians. The President made these comments after inaugurating the Centre of Excellence for Womens Healthcare at the Kilinochchi District General Hospital this morning (25), the PMD reported. President Wickremesinghe further stated: The inauguration of the Centre of Excellence for Womens Health Services signifies a significant milestone in serving the women of our nation. We have implemented various special measures to empower women, reaffirming our commitment to their well-being. In our country, there has been a notable absence of laws safeguarding womens rights beyond the basic provisions outlined in the Constitution. To address this gap, we have introduced two new drafts to Parliament aimed at enhancing womens rights. The Womens Empowerment Act proposes essential provisions to legally empower women, including the establishment of a dedicated commission for their implementation. Furthermore, we aim to pass the gender equality draft by the end of June, currently undergoing review by the courts before submission to Parliament, with anticipation for unanimous support. Our commitment to protecting womens rights extends to enacting laws against violence and ensuring equal opportunities for women in workplace promotions and transfers. We anticipate the formal legalization of womens rights and pledge to operate within this framework. Additionally, we prioritize the safety of women within their homes. These proposed womens rights bills are readily accessible on our website, and we encourage everyone to familiarize themselves with them. Furthermore, we plan to launch a specialized educational program to raise awareness about womens rights and empower them accordingly.",

        "date": "May 26, 2024 10:26 am",
        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe praised the historical Jaffna Teaching Tradition during a speech at the Jaffna District Teacher Appointment Ceremony yesterday (25). He highlighted the importance of restoring this tradition and emphasized the need for teachers to serve as exemplary figures in society. He cautioned against teachers engaging in protests that may undermine their professional image and urged them to uphold their dignity. The ceremony, which took place at the Jaffna Thanthai Selva Auditorium, saw the appointment of 375 teachers in the Northern Province. Governor of the Northern Province Mrs. P.S.M. Mrs. Charles also presented a commemorative gift to President Wickremesinghe during the event. Addressing the ceremony President Ranil Wickremesinghe further said; To all of you receiving teacher appointments today, you are embarking on a significant responsibility. You are entrusted with shaping the future of children within classrooms comprising 35-40 students. The trajectory of these childrens lives is heavily influenced by your guidance. Failure to uphold this responsibility renders one unsuitable for the teaching profession. Jaffna teachers have historically been in demand both nationally and internationally. They have demonstrated unwavering commitment to fulfilling their duties. Even at prestigious institutions like Royal College, Colombo, where I myself received my education, Jaffna teachers were recognized for their exceptional dedication. Their legacy continues to resonate in society, underscoring their exemplary practices that serve as a benchmark for educators nationwide. The development of Jaffna owes much to its steadfast commitment to education, with certain schools garnering global renown. For instance, Hartley College students have showcased their talents on prestigious platforms like Oxford University, underscoring the calibre of education in the region. I urge you to embrace this noble profession with the same fervour and dedication. Joining the ranks of Jaffnas esteemed educators is not merely a career choice but a commitment to shaping lives and contributing to the broader landscape of education. As educators, it is imperative that you serve as exemplary figures within the teaching profession. Engaging in public demonstrations or shouting slogans on the streets may compromise your credibility in the eyes of students. Therefore, it is essential that you fulfill your responsibilities with diligence and professionalism. Reflecting on the past, Jaffna boasted a commendable school system. Notably, former speaker Mr. K.B. Ratnayake received his education at Hartley College, exemplifying the quality of education prevalent at the time. However, the onset of war led to the departure of many teachers, resulting in a decline in the standards of education within the region. It is incumbent upon us to strive towards reinstating Jaffnas education system to its former glory and beyond, aiming for international standards of excellence. I propose that the governor engage in comprehensive consultations with all relevant stakeholders, including representatives from northern councils and universities, to devise a plan aimed at restoring Jaffnas school system to its former international standards. It is imperative to recognize that providing education solely in Tamil and Sinhala is insufficient; English proficiency must also be prioritized for children. To achieve this, the recruitment of qualified teachers is essential. Although this endeavour may span a period of 10-15 years, proactive measures must commence without delay. On behalf of those appointed today, I extend my heartfelt congratulations and urge them to wholeheartedly dedicate themselves to the noble task of serving the children of the north while upholding the dignity of the teaching profession. In attendance at this event were Minister Douglas Devananda, Members of Parliament Dharmalingam Siddharthan, M.A. Sumanthiran, Charles Nirmalanathan, and Kulasingham Dileepan. Also present were Northern Province Governor Mrs. P.S.M. Charles, Chairman of the Northern Provincial Council C.V.K. Sivagnanam, former State Minister Mrs. Vijayakala Maheswaran, political representatives from the province, and officials from the Northern Province, including the Northern Province Provincial Education Secretary.",

        "date": "May 26, 2024 12:51 pm",
        "content": "Presidential candidate Donald Trump was booed and heckled by many in a raucous audience at the Libertarian National Convention on Saturday night, a marked change from the adulation he receives at rallies from his fervently loyal supporters. Libertarians, who believe in limited government and individual freedom, blame Trump, a Republican, for rushing through the creation of a COVID-19 vaccine when he was president and for not doing more to stop public health restrictions on the unvaccinated during the pandemic. When Trump took to the stage in Washington, there were loud boos and jeers. A smaller section of the crowd, Trump supporters, cheered him. Shortly before he appeared, one Libertarian Party member shouted: Donald Trump should have taken a bullet! Trumps campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the hostile reception. Trump, who was president between 2017 and 2021, immediately mentioned the total 88 felony charges he faces in four federal and state prosecutions. If I wasnt a libertarian I am now, he said. He denounced the administration of President Joe Biden, his challenger in the Nov. 5 election rematch, and Bidens fellow Democrats as being part of a rise in left-wing fascism. Trump was trying to appeal to libertarians, who have more in common with Republican policy positions than Democrats on issues including taxes and the size of government, in what is expected to be a closely fought election. He added: We should not be fighting each other. He asked libertarians to work with him to defeat Biden, an appeal which was greeted by many boos, although the vast majority in the crowd were fiercely opposed to Biden and his administration. Libertarians garnered only 1.2 of the national vote in 2020, or about 1.8 million votes, but Novembers election could be decided by just tens of thousands of votes in a handful of battleground states, so Trump is seeking to peel away some libertarian support. Trumps appearance at the libertarian gathering, unusual for a Republican White House candidate, also signaled how seriously he and his campaign take the threat of third-party candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has long opposed vaccines and mandates, and who spoke to the convention on Friday. Trump has been ramping up attacks on Kennedy, who is running as an independent, recently calling him a fake anti-vaccination proponent. Opinion polls suggest Kennedy will siphon votes away from both Trump and Biden, but it is not yet clear which of the major-party candidates will be hurt more by Kennedys long-shot White House bid. Libertarian Party organizers said Biden was also invited to speak to the convention but he declined to attend. The Libertarian Party can make a big difference. If we unite we will be unstoppable, Trump said to a mix of applause and jeers. Trump said he was a libertarian without even trying to be one, and that the Libertarian Party should endorse him, another line greeted by boos and jeers. Undeterred, Trump poked fun at the crowd, saying if they did not back him, they would continue to garner just a tiny portion of voter support in national elections. He pledged to put a libertarian in his cabinet if he wins the election, which was met by cries of bullshit! Trump did get huge applause for one promise. A rallying cry for libertarians is the case of Ross Ulbricht, who is serving a life sentence for creating and operating the website Silk Road, which allowed users to secretly buy and sell drugs and other illegal products. Libertarians believe Ulbrichts 2015 sentence represents government and judicial overreach. In front of a crowd holding Free Ross signs, Trump promised to commute Ulbrichts sentence if he wins back the White House. Source: Reuters --Agencies",
