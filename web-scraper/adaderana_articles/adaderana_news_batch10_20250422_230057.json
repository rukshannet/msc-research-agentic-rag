        "date": "April 11, 2025 09:42 am",
        "content": "According to latest data, over 9,000 children have been identified as autistic in Sri Lanka. Statistics on autism and its impact on children were deliberated during a meeting of the Ministerial Consultative Committee on Women and Child Affairs held in Parliament. During the discussion, officials highlighted a noticeable increase in the number of children diagnosed with autism in Sri Lanka, according to a statement issued by the Department of Communications of Parliament. The Committee Chair, Minister of Women and Child Affairs, Saroja Savithri Paulraj had emphasized that due to the lack of proper diagnosis, many children continue to suffer from various disabilities. She stressed that early diagnosis is crucial in identifying autism during developmental stages, which would allow for timely intervention and guidance toward a healthier developmental path. Accordingly, the Chair underscored the need to implement an active monitoring mechanism from birthstarting with supervision by Public Health Midwives and continuing through early childhood development stages. Plans are also underway to establish three model daycare centers in selected regions for children with autism. It was proposed that a committee be appointed to oversee the necessary arrangements for this initiative, with the goal of supporting children through appropriate developmental stages. Meanwhile, officials from the Ministry of Education had informed the Ministerial Consultative Committee on Women and Child Affairs that a six-month training program has been proposed for student teachers in Colleges of Education. The program aims to equip them with the necessary knowledge and attitudes to treat children with disabilities equally to other children. The Committee also held extensive discussions on the importance of providing care for vulnerable children within a family environment rather than institutionalizing them. Officials from the Department of Probation and Child Care Services clarified that placing a child under probationary care is only done through a judicial process. They added that steps will be taken to educate judges on the importance of prioritizing family-based care over institutional care. Minister of Women and Child Affairs Saroja Savithri Paulraj stated that efforts are being made to bring preschools, currently operating under various mechanisms across the island, under a unified and standardized system. Officials informed the Committee that a joint policy on preschool education is being developed by the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Women and Child Affairs. They also emphasized the need to implement the already drafted preschool curriculum framework. Additionally, the Committee discussed concerns about children in plantation areas being increasingly drawn toward illicit alcohol and drug use. Specific mention was made of harmful substances such as Babool and Pan Parag. It was revealed that these substances are not included in the list of prohibited imported items by the Consumer Affairs Authority. Consequently, the Committee decided to request the Authority to take the necessary steps to include these items on the banned imports list. The Chair also pointed out that maternity leave is often not granted during the third childbirth. Officials noted that, according to amended laws, the same benefits provided for the first and second live births should be extended to the third and subsequent live births. However, this provision has not been adequately communicated to the public. The appointment of Tamil-speaking female officers to police stations in the Jaffna District was also discussed. Senior Deputy Inspector General of Police, Renuka Jayasundara, stated that there are currently 56 female officers serving in Jaffna, with 21 assigned to women and childrens units. However, only around eight of these officers are proficient in the Tamil language. The Committee further inquired about the lack of focus on womens and childrens issues within the policy frameworks of regional and district coordinating committees. District Secretaries have since been instructed to ensure these issues are included in relevant committee agendas. It was reported that such topics are now being addressed at the committee level. The importance of ensuring the participation of District Coordinating Committee Chairpersons and all relevant officers in Divisional Secretariat-level Childrens Rights Promotion Committees was also emphasized, it added. A number of Ministers, State Ministers, Committee Members, other Members of Parliament, and officials participated in the Consultative Committee meeting.",

        "date": "April 11, 2025 10:46 am",
        "content": "Tech giant Apple chartered cargo flights to ferry 600 tons of iPhones, or as many as 1.5 million, to the United States from India, after it stepped up production there in an effort to beat President Donald Trumps tariffs, sources told Reuters. The details of the push provide an insight into the U.S. smartphone companys private strategy to navigate around the Trump tariffs and build up inventory of its popular iPhones in the United States, one of its biggest markets. Analysts have warned that U.S. prices of iPhones could surge, given Apples high reliance on imports from China, the main manufacturing hub of the devices, which is subject to Trumps highest tariff rate of 125. That figure is far in excess of the tariff of 26 on imports from India, but which is now on hold after Trump called a 90-day pause this week that excludes China. Apple wanted to beat the tariff, said one of the sources familiar with the planning. The company lobbied Indian airport authorities to cut to six hours the time needed to clear customs at the Chennai airport in the southern state of Tamil Nadu, down from 30 hours, the source added. The so-called green corridor arrangement at the airport in the Indian manufacturing hub emulated a model Apple uses at some airports in China, the source said. About six cargo jets with a capacity of 100 tons each have flown out since March, one of them this week just as new tariffs kicked in, the source and an Indian government official said. The packaged weight of an iPhone 14 and its charging cable come to about 350 grams (12.35 oz), Reuters measurements show, implying the total cargo of 600 tons comprised about 1.5 million iPhones, after accounting for some packaging weight. Apple and Indias aviation ministry did not respond to a request for comment. All the sources sought anonymity as the strategy and discussions were private. Apple sells more than 220 million iPhones a year worldwide, with Counterpoint Research estimating a fifth of total iPhone imports to the United States now come from India, and the rest from China. Trump consistently increased U.S. tariffs on China, to stand at 125 by Wednesday, from 54 earlier. At the 54 tariff rate, the 1,599 cost of the top-end iPhone 16 Pro Max in the United States would have surged to 2,300, calculations based on projections by Rosenblatt Securities show. SUNDAY SHIFTS In India, Apple stepped up air shipments to meet its goal of a 20 increase in usual production at iPhone plants, attained by adding workers, and temporarily extending operations at the biggest Foxconn India factory to Sundays, the source added. Two other direct sources confirmed the Foxconn plant in Chennai now runs on Sundays, which is typically a holiday. The plant turned out 20 million iPhones last year, including the latest iPhone 15 and 16 models. As Apple diversifies its manufacturing beyond China, it has positioned India for a critical role. Foxconn and Tata, its two main suppliers there, have three factories in all, with two more being built. Apple spent about eight months to plan and set up the expedited customs clearance in Chennai, and Prime Minister Narendra Modis government asked officials to support Apple, one senior Indian official said. Foxconn shipments from India to the United States surged in value to 770 million in January and 643 million in February, compared to the range of 110 million to 331 million in the prior four months, commercially available customs data shows. More than 85 of the January and February air shipments of Foxconn were offloaded in Chicago, Los Angeles, New York and San Francisco. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "date": "April 11, 2025 10:46 am",
        "content": "Gold prices breached the key 3,200oz level for the first time on Friday, fuelled by a weaker dollar and an escalating trade war that sent investors rushing toward safe-haven assets. Spot gold was up 1.4 at 3,217.78 an ounce as of 0350 GMT. Bullion scaled an all-time peak of 3,219.84 earlier in the session, and has gained almost 6 this week. U.S. gold futures climbed 1.9 to 3,237.50. The rapid weakening of the U.S. dollar seems to be the main driver of golds rebound at the moment. That seems to reflect an ongoing exodus from USD-based assets, with stocks and bonds selloff amid tariff policy uncertainty, said Ilya Spivak, head of global macro at Tastylive. The dollar was down nearly 1 against its major peers, making greenback-priced bullion cheaper for overseas buyers. Major stock indexes also fell after U.S. President Donald Trump ratcheted up tariffs on Chinese imports to 145, but hit a 90-day pause on previously announced tariffs for dozens of countries. China has been matching Trumps tariff hikes, sparking fears that Beijing could push duties on the U.S. beyond the current 84. 3,500 is the next round number people will be looking at. I suspect we wont get there immediately or without bumps along the way, Capital.coms financial market analyst Kyle Rodda said. Apart from tariffs, central bank demand, expectations of interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, geopolitical instability in the Middle East and Europe, and increased flows into gold-backed exchange-traded funds also fuelled the metals rally this year. U.S. consumer prices fell unexpectedly in March but inflation risks are tilted to the upside, data showed. Traders now bet that the Fed will resume cutting rates in June and probably reduce by a full percentage point by the end of 2025. Spot silver added 0.3 to 31.29 an ounce, while platinum dipped 0.1 to 936.85. Palladium gained 0.8 to 916.18. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "date": "April 11, 2025 10:51 am",
        "content": "South Korean actor O Yeong Su, who rose to global prominence as Player 001 in Netflixs Squid Game, has been sentenced to one year in prison after being found guilty of sexual assault, according to South Korean media reports. The allegations against O date back to 2017, when he was accused of forcibly hugging and kissing a woman near his residence. While he initially received an eight-month prison term with a two-year probation, the latest ruling has reportedly increased his sentence to one year of imprisonment. The 80-year-old actor had been fighting the charges in an appeal trial, maintaining his innocence throughout. The final verdict in the appeal case is scheduled to be announced on June 3. As per Korean media outlets, during the appeal hearing on April 3, the prosecution characterised the veteran actor, who has spent nearly five decades in theatre, as someone who sexually harassed a powerless junior member of the theatre troupe. Prosecutors added that the victim had been living in fear both at work and in daily life since the incidents occurred. They also criticised O Yeong Sus remarks following the accusations, quoting him as saying, I did it with the heart of a father, and argued that such statements only caused further harm instead of offering any form of apology. The prosecution emphasised the consistency in the actors statements since the beginning of the investigation, stating this added to their credibility. They requested a one-year sentence not only to support the victims recovery but also to deter similar crimes in the future. O Yeong Sus legal team, however, refuted all charges. They contended that the case rested solely on the victims account, claiming her testimony lacks specificity, consistency and logical coherence. His lawyers also pointed to the timing of the allegations, suggesting that O Yeong Su responded formally only to avoid controversy that might affect Squid Game, which had just propelled him to international stardom. O Yeong Su made history as the first Korean actor to win a Golden Globe for his role in Squid Game, earning acclaim for his portrayal of the frail and enigmatic Oh Il Nam on the Netflix show.

Work on many of these projects is scheduled to commence by the end of this April, the Presidents Media Division said in a statement. A sum of Rs. 5 billion has been allocated from this years national budget for its implementation of the projects. Under the guidance of President Anura Kumara Dissanayake, the Clean Sri Lanka programme was implemented as a key government initiative.

        "date": "April 11, 2025 11:15 am",
        "content": "The International Monetary Fund (IMF) says that the Sri Lankan government remains committed to program objectives and implementation is strong and commendable, but more time is needed to assess the implications for Sri Lanka of the external shock as global uncertainty remains elevated and is contributing to financial market volatility. After concluding the discussions with the Sri Lankan authorities on economic performance and policies underpinning the Fourth Review under the IMF Extended Fund Facility (EFF) arrangement, the newly appointed Senior Mission Chief Evan Papageorgiou said that the discussions will continue toward reaching agreement in the near term on parameters and policies that will maintain the reform momentum under the program during this period of increased global uncertainty. Issuing a statement, after concluding the IMF delegations visit to Sri Lanka, Papageorgiou said that Sri Lankas ambitious reform agenda supported by the IMF Extended Fund Facility (EFF) continues to deliver commendable outcomes and that the post-crisis growth rebound of 5 percent in 2024 is impressive. Inflation declined considerably in recent quarters and has fallen to 2.6 percent at end-March 2025, he highlighted, adding that the gross official reserves increased to US6.5 billion at end-March 2025 with sizeable foreign exchange purchases by the central bank. Substantial fiscal reforms have strengthened public finances, the statement added. Furthermore, the statement noted that the recent external shock and evolving developments are creating uncertainty for the Sri Lankan economy, which is still recovering from its own economic crisis and that more time is needed to assess the impact of the global shock and how its implications for Sri Lanka can be addressed within the contours of its IMF-supported program. The governments sustained commitment to program objectives is ensuring policy continuity and program implementation remains strong. Going forward, sustaining the reform momentum is critical to safeguard the hard-won gains of the program and put the economy on a path toward lasting macroeconomic stability and higher inclusive growth, the Senior Mission Chief expressed. The statement further pointed out that against increased global uncertainty, sustained revenue mobilization efforts and prudent budget execution in line with Budget 2025 are critical to preserve the limited fiscal space. Boosting tax compliance, including by reinstating an efficient and timely VAT refund mechanism, will help contribute to revenue gains without resorting to additional tax policy measures, it added, noting that avoiding new tax exemptions will help reduce fiscal revenue leakages, corruption risks and build much needed fiscal buffers, including for social spending to support Sri Lankas most vulnerable. The IMFs Senior Mission Chief to Sri Lanka also stated that restoring cost recovery in electricity pricing will help minimize fiscal risks arising from the electricity state-owned enterprise. The government has an important responsibility to protect the poor and vulnerable at this uncertain time. It is important to redouble efforts to improve targeting, adequacy, and coverage of social safety nets. Fiscal support needs to be well-targeted, time-bound, and within the existing budget envelope While inflation remains low, continued monitoring is warranted to ensure sustained price stability and support macroeconomic stability. Against ongoing global uncertainty, it remains important to continue rebuilding external buffers through reserves accumulation, he added. Papageorgiou expressed that however, the discussions are ongoing, and the authorities are encouraged to continue to make progress on restoring cost-recovery electricity pricing, strengthening the tax exemptions framework, and other important structural reforms. Discussions are continuing with the goal of reaching staff-level agreement in the near term to pave the way for the timely completion of the fourth review. We reaffirm our commitment to support Sri Lanka at this uncertain time, Papageorgiou added. The IMF team held meetings with President and Finance Minister Anura Kumara Dissanayake, Prime Minister Dr. Harini Amarasuriya, Labor Minister and Deputy Minister of Economic Development Prof. Anil Jayantha Fernando, Deputy Minister of Finance and Planning Dr. Harshana Suriyapperuma, Central Bank of Sri Lanka Governor Dr. P. Nandalal Weerasinghe, Secretary to the Treasury Mahinda Siriwardana, Senior Economic Advisor to the President Duminda Hulangamuwa, and other senior government and CBSL officials. The team also met with parliamentarians, representatives from the private sector, civil society organizations, and development partners.",

As of this morning (Apr 11), the price of a pound of 24-carat gold has also risen to Rs. 256,000, marking a significant jump in the past few days, traders at Sea Street said. Gold prices breached the key USD 3,200 level for the first time today, fuelled by a weaker dollar and an escalating trade war that sent investors rushing toward safe-haven assets. Spot gold was up 1.4 at USD 3,217.78 an ounce as of 0350 GMT. Bullion scaled an all-time peak of USD 3,219.84 earlier in the session, and has gained almost 6 this week. U.S. gold futures climbed 1.9 to USD 3,237.50. Meanwhile, the dollar was down nearly 1 against its major peers, making greenback-priced bullion cheaper for overseas buyers. Major stock indexes also fell after U.S. President Donald Trump ratcheted up tariffs on Chinese imports to 145, but hit a 90-day pause on previously announced tariffs for dozens of countries. China has been matching Trumps tariff hikes, sparking fears that Beijing could push duties on the U.S. beyond the current 84.",

        "date": "April 11, 2025 12:38 pm",
        "content": "The Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) has signed the Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) for the 350 MW Sahasdhanavi Combined Cycle Power Plant, which will be built, owned, and operated by Sahasdhanavi Limited. Issuing a statement, the CEB said that the ownership of the power plant will be transferred to the CEB after 25 years. This marks a significant milestone in Sri Lankas pursuit of reliable and affordable electricity for families and businesses, the CEB said in the statement. The 350 MW Sahasdhanavi Combined Cycle Power Plant, approved by the Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL), will soon commence construction. It is expected to deliver electricity to the national grid within 30 months under Open Cycle operation, transitioning to full Combined Cycle operations after an additional 12 months. The plant plays a vital role in supporting Sri Lankas expanding renewable energy sector, especially during nighttime and low wind periods. Operating on regasified liquefied natural gas (R-LNG), it will provide flexible, on-demand power to balance the variability of solar and wind energy generation. By 2028, Sahasdhanavi and similar plants will fully transition from diesel to R-LNG, reducing fuel costs by approximately 50, significantly lowering emissions, and ensuring essential grid reliability as Sri Lanka expands its solar and wind generation capacity. R-LNG will serve as a key transition fuel as Sri Lanka moves towards a renewable-powered future, the statement added. Signed CEB Media Release 04 English by Adaderana Online on Scribd",

        "title": "China hits back at Trump tariff hike, raises duties on US goods to 125",
        "date": "April 11, 2025 02:04 pm",
        "content": "Beijing on Friday increased its tariffs on U.S. imports to 125, hitting back against U.S. President Donald Trumps decision to hike duties on Chinese goods to 145, raising the stakes in a trade war that threatens to up-end global supply chains. The hike comes after the White House kept the pressure on the worlds No.2 economy and second-biggest provider of U.S. imports by singling it out for an additional tariff increase, having paused most of the reciprocal duties imposed on dozens of other countries. The U.S. imposition of abnormally high tariffs on China seriously violates international and economic trade rules, basic economic laws and common sense and is completely unilateral bullying and coercion, Chinas Finance Ministry said in a statement. In response, China announced it would raise tariffs on a range of U.S. goods from 84 to 125, effective Saturday. The U.S. and China have escalated a new trade war by raising tariffs even as U.S. President Donald Trump hit a pause on tariffs for other countries. China notably had said it would fight the American tariffs with its own countermeasures, calling Trumps actions economic bullying, which led Trump to retaliate by continuously hiking up tariffs this week. Trumps universal tariffs on China total 145. When Trump announced Wednesday that China faced 125 tariffs, he did not include a 20 tariff on China tied to its role in fentanyl production. Trumps actions led business executives to warn of a potential recession, and some of the top U.S. trading partners to retaliate with their own import taxes, before the pause. But Trump and China continued raising the tariffs in a tit for tat. The U.S. alternately raising abnormally high tariffs on China has become a numbers game, which has no practical economic significance, and will become a joke in the history of the world economy, a Finance Ministry spokesman said in a statement announcing the new tariffs. However, if the US insists on continuing to substantially infringe on Chinas interests, China will resolutely counter and fight to the end. Chinas Commerce Ministry said it was filing another lawsuit with the World Trade Organization against the U.S. tariffs. Beijing last week suspended sorghum, poultry and bonemeal imports from some American companies, and put more export controls on rare earth minerals, critical for various technologies, and put a few dozen American companies on lists that would prevent Chinese companies from selling them dual-use goods. Given the size of the two economies, experts fear global economic turmoil. The head of the WTO, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, said earlier this week that the trade war between the U.S. and China could could severely damage the global economic outlook. Source: Reuters  AP -Agencies",

        "date": "April 11, 2025 02:18 pm",
        "content": "The cost of preparing a traditional kevili table for the Sinhala and Tamil New Year has risen by 7 percent in 2025 compared to the previous year, Verité Research says. The research has been conducted based on data collected from open markets in Colombo and statistics obtained from the Department of Census and Statistics. According to Verité Research an average Avurudu Kevili table remains more than twice as expensive as in 2019. A kevili table, a customary feature during New Year celebrations in Sri Lanka, includes an assortment of traditional sweetmeats symbolising prosperity and happiness. Prices increased for five out of the eight key items in 2025. Notably, the cost of milk rice rose by 57 percent and kokis by 35 percent  both of which rely heavily on coconut and coconut oil. The overall increase in kevili table prices was primarily driven by a surge in coconut prices. The price of coconuts rose by 80 percent year-on-year, while coconut oil increased by 40 percent. In contrast, the prices of most other ingredients either declined or remained stable. Furthermore, compared to 2019, the cost of a kevili table has more than doubledrising by 2.4 times in 2025, up from 2.2 times in 2024, according to a statement released by Verité Research.",

        "content": "Former President Ranil Wickremesinghe has been requested to be present before the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption (CIABOC) in relation to a statement he had made about the bribery case filed against New Democratic Front MP Chamara Sampath Dassanayake. In a letter directed to former President Wickremesinghe, the Assistant Director General of the CIABOC, Asitha Anthony has requested him to be present before the Commission at 09.30 a.m. on Thursday (April 17). According to the letter, the Assistant Director General noted that the media statement made by the former President indicates that he has more information regarding the case and by making the statement he has gotten involved in the on-going investigations. Accordingly, former President Ranil Wickremesinghe has been requested to present any relevant information to substantiate his recent statements made pertaining to the case filed against MP Dassanayake. According to the letter, if the former President fails to appear before the Commission without a valid reason, the commission is bound to act according to the provisions given in article 126 of the Anti-Corruption Act, No. 9 of 2023. Yesterday (Apr 7), former president Ranil Wickremesinghe claimed that MP Chamara Sampath Dassanayake withdrew the fixed deposits belonging to the Uva provincial council, over which he is now facing corruption charges, in accordance with a circular issued during his tenure as the prime minister. The former president questioned whether the MPs arrest over the matter was in response to his vocal criticism of the government in parliament. Parliamentarian Chamara Sampath Dassanayake has been remanded until 21 April by the Badulla Magistrates Court for allegedly misappropriating a sum of Rs. 1 million of the Uva Provincial Council in 2016. MP Chamara Sampath Dassanayake was taken into custody on March 27, over three separate corruption-related cases. The Colombo Magistrates Court previously granted bail in the cases filed against him but he remains in remand custody due to an order issued by the Badulla Magistrates Court. According to the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption (CIABOC), Dassanayake had solicited funds from three state banks, claiming they were intended to provide bags for preschool children in the province. Two banks complied, granting him Rs. 1 million and Rs. 2.5 million, which were later transferred to his personal foundation account. However, when a third bank refused to provide funds, Dassanayake reportedly retaliated by withdrawing the Uva Provincial Councils fixed deposits from that institution. The Bribery Commission filed a case against the MP, citing the government incurred a financial loss of Rs. 17.3 million due to his actions.",

The communiqué issued by the Office of the former President states it is baffling and surprising about the quick reaction by the Bribery Commission to follow up on his media statement, which was given mere 18 hours ago. However, the communiqué states that since the summons has been issued during the New Year period, the former President and his attorneys will not be available in Colombo, and therefore, a different date will be requested to appear before the commission.

        "date": "April 11, 2025 04:15 pm",
        "content": "After many years of impassioned calls for an Oscar recognizing the art of the stunt, the film academy has decided to give it an official award. An achievement in stunt design prize will be added starting with the 100th Academy Awards, which will recognize films released in 2027, the film academy said Thursday. Since the early days of cinema, stunt design has been an integral part of filmmaking, Academy CEO Bill Kramer and Academy President Janet Yang said in a joint statement. We are proud to honor the innovative work of these technical and creative artists, and we congratulate them for their commitment and dedication in reaching this momentous occasion. The film academys production and technology branch has more than 100 stunt performers among its ranks. David Leitch, who directed The Fall Guy, which was itself an ode to stunt performers, helped lead the charge for the new prize. Leitch began his career as a stuntman for stars like Brad Pitt before transitioning to making stunt-heavy films like John Wick. He and stunt coordinator and designer Chris OHara of Stunts Unlimited made presentations to the academy advocating for the addition of a new award. Stunts are essential to every genre of film and rooted deep in our industrys history  from the groundbreaking work of early pioneers like Buster Keaton, Harold Lloyd, and Charlie Chaplin, to the inspiring artistry of todays stunt designers, coordinators, performers, and choreographers, Leitch said in a statement Thursday. Chris OHara and I have spent years working to bring this moment to life, standing on the shoulders of the stunt professionals whove fought tirelessly for recognition over the decades. We are incredibly grateful. Stunt designer is a relatively new designation. For his work on The Fall Guy OHara was the first person to be credited as such. To be seen by the film community as stunt designers hopefully brings more light to what we really do, OHara told The Associated Press in 2024. Back in the day, stunt guys were the cowboys. Now we are creative. We create amazing things, just like a production designer does or a costume designer does. The Oscars paid tribute to the stunt community with a video montage at the 2024 ceremony, looking back at over 100 years of Hollywood stunts from Chaplin and Keaton all the way to Mission: Impossible and The Matrix. Other awards shows were ahead of the curve in celebrating stunts: The Emmys honors stunt coordination and stunt performance, while the Screen Actors Guild Awards recognize stunt ensembles in television and film. The Oscars also recently added a prize for achievement in casting, starting with films released in 2025. As with the casting award, it remains unclear whether it will be added to the live Oscars broadcast. Chad Stahelski, who co-directed John Wick and did stunts for Keanu Reeves, told the AP Thursday that theres still work to be done. The idea of giving an Academy Award for stunt design is awesome  dont get me wrong, he said. Now I would like to know whos going to decide who gets it, and who actually gets the award? Its not like it was 100 years ago when there was one person designing it. Its a collaborative effort. Stahelski added: Stunts is such a collaborative and complicated department, how are we going to determine who this goes to? Weve spent 100 years getting the award, lets just make sure it goes to the right people. Source: AP --Agencies",

Speaking at a media briefing held at the Government Information Department, Harsha Purasinghe said based on a request by Sri Lanka Police, the new system has been introduced. He said the new system will enable those who receive charge sheets to instantly pay the fines by adding the reference number. He added that since all police stations have been equipped with a mobile phone linking the system, Police officers who issue the respective charge sheet will receive the acknowledgement and that will enable the relevant officer to return the driving license back. The current procedure is to take the charge sheets, issued by Police officers for traffic offences committed by drivers to post offices, making the payments, and then submitting the relevant receipts of payment to the Police station to retrieve the driving license. ICTA board member Harsha Purasinghe noted that since the new system provides an opportunity to instantly pay fines for multiple offenses, if a motorist commits more than one violation, Police officers are able to issue additional charge sheets. With effect from today (Apr 11), an online instant payment method of fines issued for traffic offences, through the GovPay application has been introduced as a project to digitize Sri Lanka Police. Accordingly, the pilot project will be implemented from today (Apr 11) to April 30, 2025, covering the roads in Kurunegala, Doratiyawa, Melsiripura, Gokarella, Galewela, Dambulla, Madatugama, Maradankadawala, Kekirawa, Thirappane, Kawarakkulama and Anuradhapura. Through the initiative, Sri Lanka Police said it intends to identify the inconveniences and shortcomings encountered during the pilot project and implement the project islandwide after rectifying the issues.",

In a video verified by Reuters, the 88-year-old pontiff is seen in a wheelchair wearing black pants and with a striped blanket wrapped around his chest. The pope, waving at visitors to the basilica as attendants pushed his wheelchair, had a small nasal hose to receive supplemental oxygen, the video showed.

Few people noticed, it was very quick, but he stopped to talk to a family with a baby. Francis is recovering at the Vatican after spending 38 days in hospital for double pneumonia, in the most serious health crisis of his 12-year papacy. He has only made one previous public appearance since being discharged on March 23, when he briefly greeted crowds during an event in St. Peters Square on April 6. The pope rarely makes public appearances wearing civilian garb rather than his traditional papal vestments, but has occasionally dressed down during some trips abroad. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

Upon their arrival in Myanmar last week, the team was immediately dispatched to Nay Pyi Taw province, one of the regions severely affected by the earthquake. On Thursday (Apr 10), they were further deployed to Pobba Thiri Township, where they continued to operate mobile medical clinics as part of their relief mission. The Sri Lankan team has been providing critical medical assistance to affected communities, with a special focus on women, children and vulnerable individuals currently sheltering in Internally Displaced Persons (IDP) centres. These centres include facilities set up at the Ministry of Commerce, Lat Lok Toun Pagoda and Mashikhana Monastery. The mobile medical units have been addressing urgent healthcare needs, including treating injuries, managing infections and ensuring the overall well-being of those impacted by the disaster. In addition to immediate medical care, the team is also offering psychological support and health education to help restore a sense of normalcy to the affected population. The on-going relief operations highlight the strong humanitarian commitment and regional solidarity of the Sri Lankan armed forces in responding to emergencies beyond national borders.

        "date": "April 12, 2025 06:22 am",
        "content": "The World Health Organization (WHO) highlights that Sri Lanka has made remarkable progress by reducing maternal mortality to 25 per 100,000 live births in 2023 due to the countrys free and equitable maternal health services and commitment to continuous quality improvement. However, the global health organization also noted a rise in low birth weight babies, as shown in recent studies, highlighting the urgent need to examine the underlying causes and the role of maternal nutrition. Marking World Health Day on April 07, the World Health Organization kicked off a yearlong campaign on maternal and newborn health for 2025, titled Healthy Beginnings, Hopeful Futures. The campaign focuses on urging governments and health communities to elevate their efforts to preventable maternal and newborn deaths, and to prioritize womens long-term health and well-being. The global health body stated that maternal and newborn health statistics remain alarming, with nearly 300,000 annual maternal deaths due to pregnancy and childbirth complications. While global efforts have led to a 40 reduction in maternal mortality since 2000, the maternal mortality rate remains high in certain regions. Sub-Saharan Africa accounts for approximately 70 of global maternal deaths in 2023, while Central and Southern Asia contribute another 17. During a webinar series conducted in collaboration with Sri Lankas Ministry of Health, the WHO highlighted the countrys significant progress in reducing maternal mortality to 25 per 100,000 live births in 2023. This achievement was attributed to Sri Lankas free and equitable maternal health services, professional midwifery, data-driven decision-making, and commitment to continuous quality improvement. While highlighting Sri Lankas positive progress, the WHO also acknowledged the looming concerns posed by economic downturns and rising poverty, calling for more evidence-based interventions and policies to safeguard maternal nutrition. Recent studies indicate a rise in low birth weight babies, highlighting the urgent need to examine the underlying causes and the role of maternal nutrition. The WHO emphasized that maternal nutrition also has long-term implications for health and development.

        "content": "President Anura Kumara Dissanayake assured that the National Peoples Power (NPP) government will not let racial and ethnic violence erupt in the country again. Speaking at an NPP Public Rally in Akkaraipattu, Ampara, the President claimed that projects under Indias Rs. 2 billion pledge for the development of agriculture, dairy and fisheries industries in the Eastern Province will commence next month. The National Peoples Power is the only government that treats every race equally in this country. Back in the day when other governments were in power, violent incidents were reported in Digana, Akurana, and Aluthgama. Religious sites were attacked. We certify to you that we will not let chaos erupt in this country again. The Head of the State further commented: Our movement is against other movements that contribute to racism. You all know about the Easter Sunday attack that took place in our country. After that attack, the Muslim community was bullied and shamed. They faced these harassments with discomfort. What did the Muslim people say at that time? They said that they informed the responsible authorities about the development of extremist groups, and that the authorities did not take action regarding that matter. They stressed that the country is reaping the effects of lack of action. Dissanayake assured that the government remains firm on the decision to never let those incidents happen again, stating, Thats what we have a government for. A government is not supposed to take action after something happens. The President also commented on the countrys economy and investments: There was a significant economic crisis, and we have reduced it to a certain level. The foreign investors left our country, and projects came to a halt. We took the decision to commence the projects funded by Japan, India, and China. During Indian Prime Minister Modis visit, the Indian government pledged Rs. 2 billion worth of assistance for the dairy, agriculture and fishing industries in the Eastern Province. We will commence those projects next month, he noted.",

        "date": "April 12, 2025 10:58 am",
        "content": "Tesla officially launched in Saudi Arabia on Thursday, marking a new chapter in the companys global expansion after Elon Musk s troubled relationship with the kingdom  but the Middle East countrys extreme heat could pose a challenge for its electric vehicle performance and battery efficiency. Musk and Saudi Arabia have had a complicated history. Back in 2018, the Tesla CEO claimed he had secured funding from the kingdoms sovereign wealth fund to take the company private. That deal never happened, leading to lingering tensions. With the launch of its first showroom and service center in the Saudi capital, Riyadh, Tesla makes its long-anticipated entry into the Saudi market. The facility will offer models, including Model 3, Model Y and the Cybertruck, and pop-up stores are also opening in Riyadh, Jeddah, and Dammam. The Riyadh event drew a large and diverse crowd  from content creators and car enthusiasts to visitors excited about Teslas launch. Its a beautiful step weve been waiting for  to finally see Tesla open in Saudi Arabia, said Bader Khalid, a local businessman. The country is clearly moving toward electric vehicles. Tesla is one of the most important EV companies in the world, so its a big deal to have them present in our market, he added. However, the kingdom still faces significant challenges in infrastructure, with a limited number of public EV charging stations available. The government has announced plans to expand charging networks as part of its sustainability goals. Musk has a large fan base in the kingdom, praised by many for his creativity and innovation, and seen as a visionary of the future. Hes always looking ahead, said Mohammed Osama, a teenager who describes himself as enthusiastic about everything Tesla. Maybe a few things dont make sense right now, but in the future, itll all come together  hes building something bigger. Many attendees expected Musk to make an appearance, at least via video, but he didnt show. Though Tesla has faced criticism and even vandalism in parts of the United States and elsewhere, after Musk took a prominent role in President Donald Trumps administration. People have protested Musks Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, which has been moving to slash the size of the federal government through large-scale layoffs, contract cancellations and other moves. Still, many in Saudi Arabia believe that wont impact Teslas performance in the kingdom. Political events outside of Saudi Arabia dont concern us, said Khalid. So I dont think this thing has any effect. Lucid Motors, another luxury electric vehicle manufacturer, headquartered in California, has had a deepening relationship with Saudi Arabia. The kingdoms Public Investment Fund is one of Lucids largest backers, owning a majority stake in the company. In 2022, Lucid announced plans to build its first international manufacturing plant in the city of Jeddah, a major step in the kingdoms push to become a hub for advanced automotive technology. The growing interest in electric vehicles aligns with Saudi Arabias Vision 2030  an ambitious plan to diversify the economy and reduce its dependence on oil. EVs are a key part of the strategy, with the government aiming for 30 of all vehicles in Riyadh to be electric by 2030. Source: AP --Agencies",

        "content": "The U.S. ambassador to Ukraine is stepping down from her post after nearly three years in Kyiv amid uncertainty over the Trump administrations attempts to broker a peace deal to end the Russia-Ukraine war. The State Department said Thursday that Bridget Brink will be leaving her post in the near future, although it was not immediately clear exactly when she would depart. Brink assumed the job under former President Joe Bidens administration and has been a staunch advocate for U.S. military assistance to Ukraine. Her resignation had been expected for some time, especially considering the Trump administrations premium on rapprochement with Russia and ending the war. Ambassador Brink has been at the embassy in Ukraine for three years during a time of war, State Department spokeswoman Tammy Bruce told reporters. For those three years its been an extraordinary performance there. And we wish her well. At the same time, of course, its a reminder when it comes to the issues that we think about that surround this conversation is that we know that were working for (peace) and that is our focus. Brink, a career foreign service officer, has been outspoken in her support for arming Ukraine to help it defend itself from Russias invasion and had continued her advocacy even after President Donald Trump took office in January and began to pressure Ukraine to accept a ceasefire proposal. Just in the past several weeks, she has visited a number of areas bombed by Russia and posted photos of her travels on social media. Like other career ambassadors, Brink had submitted her resignation to the incoming Trump administration after Novembers election, but it was not accepted. It was not immediately clear if the administration has chosen a replacement for her, although officials said there are several candidates in mind. Source: AP --Agencies",

He further stated that the government has now reached a truly regrettable position, and that no previous administration has acted in this manner. If the content of this agreement cannot be disclosed due to diplomatic reasons, the government should at least have the backbone to admit that and explain why.

Wind gusts of up to 93mph (150 kph) - the strongest in the Chinese capital for more than half a century - are set to continue through the weekend, forcing the closure of attractions and historic sites. Millions were urged to stay indoors on Friday, with some state media outlets warning that people weighing less than 50kg may be easily blown away.

        "date": "April 12, 2025 08:30 pm",
        "content": "US President Donald Trumps administration has exempted smartphones and computers from reciprocal tariffs, including the 125 levies imposed on Chinese imports. US Customs and Border Patrol published a notice late on Friday explaining the goods would be excluded from Trumps 10 global tariff on most countries and the much larger Chinese import tax. The move comes after concerns from US tech companies that the price of gadgets could skyrocket, as many of them are made in China. The exemptions also include other electronic devices and components, including semiconductors, solar cells and memory cards. The US is a major market for iPhones, while Apple accounted for more than half of its smartphones sales last year, according to Counterpoint Research. It says as much as 80 of Apples iPhones intended for US sale are made in China, with the remaining 20 made in India. Along with fellow smartphone giants such as Samsung, Apple has been trying to diversify its supply chains to avoid over-reliance on China in recent years. India and Vietnam emerged as frontrunners for additional manufacturing hubs. As tariffs took effect, Apple reportedly looked to speed up and increase its production of India-produced devices in recent days. Trump had planned a host of steep tariffs on countries around the world set to go into effect this week. But on Wednesday, he quickly reversed course, announcing that he would implement a 90-day pause for countries hit by higher US tariffs - except China - whose tariffs he raised to 145. Trump said the Chinese tariff increase was because of the countrys readiness to retaliate with its own 84 levy on US goods. In a dramatic change of policy, Trump said all countries that had not retaliated against US tariffs would receive a reprieve  and only face a blanket US tariff of 10  until July. The White House said the move was a negotiating tactic to extract more favourable trade terms from other countries. Trump has said his import taxes will address unfairness in the global trading system, as well as bring jobs and factories back to American shores. Source: BBC --Agencies",

        "date": "April 13, 2025 07:57 am",
        "content": "Prime Minister Dr. Harini Amarasuriya stated that the government is currently working to initiate new projects across every area of Sri Lanka and to bring the necessary investments to rural areas in order to improve the participation of the communities in strengthening the national economy. The Prime Minister made these remarks while addressing a public gathering held yesterday (12) in Nanattan, Mannar, according to the Prime Ministers Media Division. Prime Minister Dr. Harini Amarasuriya further stated: Our country has reached a decisive point. The government of National Peoples Power (NPP) stands at understanding the expectations of the people. The general public came together despite the ethnic and religious barriers to exercise their voting right against the corruption in the politics that existed in this country. Consequently, Anura Kumara Dissanayake was able to become the President in 2024. A month later, we formed a Parliament that will initiate in changing the history. Today, we have a government made up of 159 members. There is now a strong group in Parliament standing against the corruption and a government that represents all ethnicities, religions, and regions. For the first time in history, we have formed a government made by a single party that represents everyone. The people are the ones who made this victory possible and they are the true victors in this cause. We are committed to protecting the trust the people have placed in us and to fulfilling their expectations. You are well aware of how weak the economy was when we came to power. Officially, we had been declared a bankrupt nation before the world. For many years, Sri Lanka had no economic growth and was in a debt-ridden economy. Tourism sector had been collapsed. Due to the corruption in political authority, investors were unwilling to invest the country. Today, we have changed all that. We have officially succeeded in removing the label of bankrupted. We have managed to steer the economy towards growth leading the investments are being restored and the confidence in Sri Lanka has increased internationally. We are working to start new projects in every area of Sri Lanka to bring the necessary investments to the rural sector, with the aim of improving the participation of rural communities in the national economy. The first budget of the NPP government has passed. Even though the economy is not yet strong, we focused on two main priorities in the budget: one was to develop infrastructure necessary for economic growth, and the other was to provide relief to people burdened by economic hardships. Thats why we have increased and extended the period of Aswesuma benefits. Further, for schools with lower than 300 students, vouchers to buy schoolbooks was distributed along with the governments intervention to strengthening the social protection system. Previous governments were a burden to the people. But today, we have a very small Cabinet of members. The government is no longer a burden to people. We have reduced expenses, minimized losses, and eliminated the corruption. Because of a government that is not a burden to the people, it was able to provide relief to the people. Through this budget, the basic salaries of public service have been increased. Now, the public service has become a much better place to earn a good income. They have been given the opportunity to work freely. Decisions for the people are now statistical data and not based on political preferences. What we expect is an independent public service. We are in need of a people-centered government as well as a public service and it should be an efficient, corruption-free, people-sensitive public service. We have already created the necessary environment for that. In order to develop the rural economy, the government has allocated a large amount of funding through this years budget but for that allocations are to be used properly for the purpose of serving people, the local government institutions are need to be cleaned up. If the leaders who represents the villages are corrupted, the allocation of fundings will become worthless. That is why the upcoming local government elections has become extremely significant and decisive. The event was attended by the Members of Parliament Jegadeeswaran and S .Thilakanadan, public representatives, and candidates of local government election representing the NPP, the statement added.",

        "content": "Sri Lanka has advanced three places in the global passport strength index, moving from 171st to 168th in 2025, according to a report published by Dubai-based global consultancy firm Nomad Capitalist. As in previous years, Nomad Capitalist has released its Global Passport Index for 2025. The index ranks passports from around the world based on five criteria: visa-free travel, taxation, global perception, dual citizenship potential and personal freedom. Sri Lanka scored 43.5 in this years index. At present, Sri Lankan passport holders can travel to 57 countries without a visa, or obtain a visa on arrival or an e-visa. In the global perception category, Sri Lanka scored 30. According to Nomad Capitalist, countries scoring below 50 in this metric often face negative reception from locals when their citizens travel abroad, indicating that Sri Lankan travellers may not experience warm hospitality in many parts of the world. In terms of personal freedom, Sri Lankas score stands at a low 20  considered the low level of personal liberty. The report notes that those scoring between 10 and 20 enjoy very limited freedom as citizens. Ireland has topped the index this year, with a score of 109. Irish passport holders can travel to 176 countries either visa-free or with a visa on arrival. Switzerland and Greece share the second position, both scoring 108.5. Citizens of these countries enjoy visa-free or visa-on-arrival access to 175 destinations worldwide. Portugal is placed fourth, while Malta and Italy jointly hold the fifth position in the global ranking of powerful passports. Among South Asian nations, the Maldives holds the strongest passport, ranking 104th globally with a score of 65.5. Maldivian passport holders enjoy visa-free or visa-on-arrival access to 101 countries. At the other end of the spectrum, Afghanistan has the weakest passport both globally and within South Asia. It ranks 199th with a score of 27. Pakistan follows closely, ranking 195th with a score of 32, placing it among the five weakest passports in the Nomad Capitalist list. Bangladesh is ranked 181st while Nepal in 180th position, scoring 39.5. India holds the 148th position with a score of 47.5, allowing its citizens to travel visa-free or with a visa on arrival to 75 countries. Bhutan has surpassed both India and Sri Lanka in the region, ranking 140th with a score of 49, making it South Asias second strongest passport after the Maldives.

        "date": "April 13, 2025 12:25 pm",
        "content": "Sudans notorious paramilitary group launched a two-day attack on famine-hit camps for displaced people that left more than 100 dead, including 20 children and nine aid workers, in the Darfur region, a U.N. official said Saturday. The Rapid Support Forces and allied militias launched an offensive on the Zamzam and Abu Shorouk camps and the nearby city of el-Fasher, the provincial capital of North Darfur province, on Friday, said U.N. Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator in Sudan Clementine Nkweta-Salami. El-Fasher is under the control of the military, which has fought the RSF since Sudan descended into civil war two years ago, killing more than than 24,000 people, according to the United Nations, though activists say the number is likely far higher. The camps were attacked again on Saturday, Nkweta-Salami said in a statement. She said that nine aid workers were killed while operating one of the very few remaining health posts still operational in Zamzam camp. This represents yet another deadly and unacceptable escalation in a series of brutal attacks on displaced people and aid workers in Sudan since the onset of this conflict nearly two years ago, she said. Nkweta-Salami didnt identify the aid workers but Sudans Doctors Union said in a statement that six medical workers with the Relief International were killed when their hospital in Zamzam came under attack on Friday. They include Dr. Mahmoud Babaker Idris, a physician at the hospital, and Adam Babaker Abdallah, head of the group in the region, the union said. It blamed the RSF for this criminal and barbaric act. In a statement Saturday evening, Relief International mourned the death of its nine workers, saying they were killed the previous day in a targeted attack on all health infrastructure in the region, including the groups clinic. The group said the central market in Zamzam along with hundreds of makeshift homes in the camp were destroyed in the attack. The offensive forced about 2,400 people to flee the camps and el-Fasher, according to the General Coordination for Displaced Persons and Refugees, a local group in Darfur. Zamzam and Abu Shouk shelter more than 700,000 people who have been forced to flee their homes across Darfur during past bouts of fighting in the region, Nkweta-Salami said. Late last month, the Sudanese military regained control over Khartoum, a major symbolic victory in the war. But the RSF still controls most of Darfur and some other areas. The two camps are among five areas in Sudan where famine was detected by the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, IPC, a global hunger monitoring group. The war has created the worlds largest humanitarian crisis, with about 25 million people  half of Sudans population  facing extreme hunger. Source: AP --Agencies",

        "date": "April 13, 2025 02:49 pm",
        "content": "The Small Hydro Power Developers Association of Sri Lanka (SHPDA) has appealed to the Minister of Power and Energy to intervene and rescind the directive issued to shut down numerous small hydropower plants in the island. Issuing a statement, Thusitha Peiris, the President of the Small Hydro Power Developers Association said members of his association are outraged by the Ceylon Electricity Boards (CEB) directive to shut down numerous small hydropower plants, effective 11 April. The decision, made under the guise of stabilizing the grid during the festive season, is a severe blow to Sri Lankas power sector and a direct threat to the nations energy security, the statement added. Thusitha Peiris said small hydropower plants provide a vital service to Sri Lankas electricity grid and unlike intermittent sources such as solar and wind, small hydro offers a consistent and reliable energy supply, operating 247 to meet peak demand, particularly in the night. He said, The CEBs decision to shut down these reliable power sources is a self-inflicted wound, stemming from its failures in grid modernization, its lack of investment in essential technologies like Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) and advanced weather forecasting, and its fundamental lack of effective system planning, which prioritizes short-term fixes over long-term, sustainable solutions. According to the President of the Small Hydro Power Developers Association, the shutdown has substantial and far-reaching economic consequences and the CEBs order to halt operation of the countrys 450MW small hydro capacity for approximately 8 hours a day, results in a supply loss of 1.8 million units to the national grid. He also called on the Minister of Power and Energy to direct the CEB to compensate small hydropower developers for the significant financial losses incurred due to the shutdown. In response to the claim, the Ceylon Electricity Board said the decision to shut down has been taken due to the low demand for electricity during the New Year period owing to the closure of factories, businesses and other office premises. Accordingly, the CEB said the temporary closure will ensure the grid remains stable during the festive period.",

        "content": "A committee has been appointed to look into the repealing of the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA), the Ministry of Justice and National Integration has announced. The committee will be headed by Presidents Counsel Rienzie Arsecularatne and is expected to commence public consultations in May. The committee has also been tasked with obtaining inputs from civil society organizations, and feedback from international institutions and communities. A preliminary discussion regarding the repeal of the PTA was held on 11 April under the leadership of the Minister of Justice and National Integration, Attorney-at-law Harsha Nanayakkara, at the Ministry of Justice premises. During the discussion, the Justice Minister has claimed that the repeal of the Prevention of Terrorism Act is a policy of the incumbent government. The Justice Minister has emphasized that the new Act should be one that can tackle global terrorism and challenges, while also ensuring it does not infringe upon constitutionally guaranteed human rights and the freedom of expression, as recognized internationally. The Ministry of Justice further stated that past governments have not acted with due diligence in bringing about these legal reforms, and that the appointed committee has been instructed to concretely identify the relevant matters for repealing the Act within a short timeframe.",

        "date": "April 13, 2025 04:42 pm",
        "content": "In a major shift in US immigration policy, the White House has announced a sweeping new rule requiring all foreign nationals residing in the United States for more than 30 days to register with the federal governmentor face severe penalties. This includes undocumented immigrants, visa holders (such as H-1B and F-1), legal permanent residents, and even recent arrivals without valid documentation. Whos impacted from the new rules? Effective April 11, 2025, the regulation mandates that all non-citizens aged 18 and older must carry proof of registration at all times. Those entering the US after this date must register within 30 days of arrival. Children turning 14 must also re-register and submit fingerprints, regardless of any prior status. All foreign nationals present in the United States longer than 30 days must register with the federal government. Failure to comply with this is a crime punishable by fines, imprisonment, or both, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement. If not, you will be arrested, fined, deported, never to return to our country again, she added. She also mentioned that the deadline to register under the Alien Registration Act was on April 11 (local time). The directive, rooted in the decades-old Alien Registration Act from World War II, was given the green light after a ruling from US District Judge Trevor N. McFadden, a Trump appointee, who dismissed a legal challenge by advocacy groups. The judge ruled that the plaintiffs lacked sufficient legal standing to block the rules enforcement, clearing the way for the controversial regulation to take effect. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) clarified that individuals entering the US after April 11 are required to register within 30 days. Children turning 14 must also re-register and provide fingerprints, regardless of any prior registration status. Leavitt, who also serves as assistant to President Donald Trump, emphasised that this measure was about national security and law enforcement. The penalties for non-compliance include a fine of up to 5,000 or imprisonment for up to 30 days, in addition to deportation proceedings and a permanent ban from re-entering the country. The move has triggered widespread concern, particularly among undocumented immigrants, temporary visa holders, and mixed-status families, many of whom fear the new policy could lead to sweeping enforcement actions and heightened scrutiny. --Agencies",

Sri Lankans are set to celebrate the dawn of the traditional New Year this year at the auspicious time of 03.21 a.m. tomorrow (14). The New Year, known as Aluth Avurudda in Sinhala, and Puththandu in Tamil, is celebrated by both communities by observing various rituals and customs. According to traditional astrological belief, the Sun completes its movement across the twelve segments of the Zodiac in the course of a year taking one month to travel each constellation. The transition of the Sun from the House of Pisces to the House of Aries marks the beginning of the New Year (Aluth Avurudu). A number of customs and traditional beliefs are associated with Avurudu celebrations in Sri Lanka. The Sinhalese are influenced by astrological faiths and perform several religious practices during this time. In general, all communities engage in various traditional activities to usher in the Sinhala and Tamil New Year which is the most important holiday period in Sri Lanka. Auspicious times of 2025 Sinhala and Tamil New Year are as below: The New Moon The new moon can be sighted on the 01st of May (Thursday) Bathing for Old Year Bathing for the old year falls on the 13th of April (Sunday) Dawn of the New Year New Year will dawn at 03.21 a.m on the 14th of April (Monday) Punya Kaalaya (Inauspicious Time) Punya Kalaya or inauspicious time begins at 8.57 p.m on the 13th of April (Sunday) and ends at 9.45 a.m on the 14th of April (Monday) Preparing of Meals Preparing meals for the New Year should begin at 04.04 a.m on the 14th of April (Monday) (Light the hearth clad in copper-coloured clothes and facing the direction of the South) Prepare milk rice and sweetmeats as well as Deekiri and puffed rice Commencing Work, Transactions and Partaking Meals April 14 (Monday) at 06.44 a.m clad in pearl and white-coloured clothes and facing the direction of South Anointing Oil April 16 (Wednesday) at 9.04 a.m. clad in green colour clothes and facing the direction of North Leaving for Work April 17 (Thursday) at 9.03 a.m., clad in gold-coloured clothes while facing north when leaving the house Planting a Tree Saplings April 18 (Friday) at 10.16 a.m. clad in bright-coloured clothes and facing the direction of East Wishing you a prosperous Sinhala and Tamil New Year!",

        "title": "CEB calls for collective action to temporarily pause rooftop solar to protect grid stability",
        "date": "April 13, 2025 10:32 pm",
        "content": "The Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) has reiterated its appeal to all rooftop solar system owners across Sri Lanka to voluntarily switch off their solar PV systems during daytime hours, from 9.00 a.m. to 3.00 p.m., until April 21, 2025. Issuing a statement in this regard, the CEB emphasized that this request was made with the utmost concern for the safety and stability of the national power grid during the Sinhala and Tamil New Year holiday period. It said sunny conditions have led to high production from rooftop solar at a time when customer demand is at its lowest, creating serious risks to grid stability. To provide a better understanding of the situation, the CEB has outlined the technical challenges in simple terms: According to the statement, when electricity demand drops significantly  as it does during the long April holidays  and sunlight is abundant, Sri Lankas power system, much like in any other country, faces this challenge: Heres what happens  Too much solar power floods the grid during the daytime.  Demand (usage) is very low, especially with most factories and offices closed.  To balance this, the CEB shuts down large power plants such as hydro, coal, and other thermal plants.  However, the CEB cannot control the production from rooftop solar PV systems unless customers shut them down.  The larger power plants provide a critical service to the grid called inertia, which helps keep the electricity frequency stable. Solar PV systems cannot provide this assurance to the grid. Explaining further about Inertia, the statement said, Inertia is primarily provided by the spinning mass of large generators. It helps the grid resist sudden changes in power. Without adequate inertia, even a small glitch can cause voltage or frequency problems, leading to partial or total blackouts. The statement further explained the importance of managing the systems inertia. A table comparing the estimated customer demand and electricity generation at 12.30 p.m. on April 11 and 12  versus a typical weekday  highlights how stable or unstable the grid would be under different conditions. It also shows how the CEB managed the situation on April 12, and what the systems inertia level would have been without these interventions. During this period, demand on the national grid reduced to as low as 1550 MW in the morning hours. Simultaneously, a surge in solar generation forced the CEB to shut down large synchronous generators, such as hydro and thermal plants, which are crucial for grid stability. On April 12, the CEB took proactive steps to stabilize the national grid by carefully managing the electricity supply. These measures ensured that the grids inertia  a critical stabilizing force provided by traditional power plants like hydro and thermal  remained at 56, a level sufficient (though not ideal) to prevent a sudden grid collapse. Without this intervention, inertia support would have plummeted to 34, a dangerously low level where even minor disruptions could trigger widespread blackouts. This highlights how the CEBs actions safeguarded the grid during a vulnerable period and underscores why continued public cooperation is essential to avoid similar risks during the remaining days of the New Year holidays. In its statement, the CEB further explained the necessity of temporarily curtailing rooftop solar generation:  All rooftop solar systems cannot be seen or controlled by the CEB control center.  They operate automatically based on sunlight, not actual electricity demand from customers.  When demand is low and solar output is high, conventional power plants are forced offline, making the grid unstable. Until Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS), water batteries, and grid-forming inverters are widely deployed, Sri Lankas grid must rely on large synchronous machines to supply inertia and ensure stability. At present, Sri Lanka does not have sufficient BESS or advanced solar inverters that can provide this support. Sri Lanka has over 7 million electricity customers. Only about 100,000 are rooftop solar owners. But when the grid becomes unstable, everyone is at risk. In light of this situation, the CEB kindly appeals to all solar PV system owners to voluntarily switch off their systems each day from 9.00 a.m. until 3.00 p.m., allowing the grid to remain stable and protected during this critical period. As a courtesy, the CEB said it will send individual SMS reminders to all solar PV customers.",

        "date": "April 14, 2025 09:07 am",
        "content": "Ecuadorian voters weary of crime reelected President Daniel Noboa, a conservative young millionaire with a divisive no-holds-barred crimefighting record, by a wide margin Sunday, but his opponent vowed to seek a recount over what she described as grotesque electoral fraud. Figures released by Ecuadors National Electoral Council showed Noboa receiving 55.8 of the vote with more than 92 of ballots counted, while leftist lawyer Luisa González earned 44. Council president Diana Atamaint said those results showed an irreversible trend in favor of Noboa. The win gives Noboa four years to fulfill the promises he first made in 2023, when he stunned voters by winning a snap election and a 16-month presidency despite his limited political experience. Ecuador is changing... and that path will mean our children will live better lives than we did, Noboa told supporters during a brief speech in which he also criticized his opponents fraud allegations. I find it embarrassing that with an 11- or 12-point difference, they come out to question the will of the Ecuadorians, Noboa added. Ecuadorians have already spoken, now we have to get to work. Noboa, heir to a fortune built on the banana trade, is expected to continue applying some of his no-holds-barred crimefighting strategies that part of the electorate finds appealing but which have tested the limits of laws and norms of governing. Gonzálezs defeat marks the third consecutive time that the party of Rafael Correa, the countrys most influential president this century, failed to return to the presidency. She told supporters that her campaign does not recognize the results presented by the (National Electoral Council), arguing among other issues that pre-election polls showed her ahead of Noboa. The candidates advanced to Sundays contest after getting the most votes in Februarys first-round election. Noboa led González by about 17,000 votes that time. Voters were primarily worried about the violence that transformed the country, starting in 2021  a spike in crime tied to the trafficking of cocaine produced in neighboring Colombia and Peru. Both candidates promised tough-on-crime policies, better equipment for law enforcement and international help to fight drug cartels and local criminal groups. My vote is clear, said Irene Valdez, a retiree who voted for Noboa. I want to continue living in freedom. College student Martín Constante had a different view. I think Luisa is going to change things because Noboa has been very authoritarian, Constante, 19, said near a voting center in Quito, the capital. Our country needs a lot of changes. Much of Gonzálezs support comes from people who long for the low crime and unemployment rates of Correas presidency but gloss over his authoritarian tendencies, the huge debt he ran up and the corruption-related sentence handed down to him in absentia in 2020. More than 13 million people were eligible to vote, which is mandatory for adults up to the age of 65. It is optional for people aged 16 and 17 and over 65. Failure to vote results in a 46 fine. Electoral authorities reported voter participation of more than 80. The most important thing is that a comfortable result gives peace of mind to the country because it avoids a political confrontation, or even worse, a violent one due to accusations of fraud, said Grace Jaramillo, an Andean region expert and professor at the University of British Columbia. Noboas victory is clear, and that also reassures the international community in the face of a wave of uncertainty. Atamaint said several people, including voters and poll workers, were arrested over ballot anomalies. She said some cases involved double voting and others stemmed from reports of counterfeit, pre-marked ballots. Atamaint added that 17 people were caught taking photos of their ballots, which the National Electoral Council banned for this election citing reports of voter coercion by criminal groups. The violation comes with a maximum fine of 32,000. Many Ecuadorians used their vote to express rejection of a candidate and not necessarily to endorse the candidate they voted for. Ecuador is polarized, which is a sign of rejection of the past, but also of the recent policies of the Noboa administration, political analyst Oswaldo Landázuri said, adding that the expected tight result could become a major problem for the country if one candidate does not recognize the other as the winner. In 2023, Noboa and González were largely unknown to most voters as they sought the presidency for the first time. They were first-term lawmakers in May 2023, when then-President Guillermo Lasso dissolved the National Assembly, shortening his own mandate as a result and triggering that years snap election. Noboas first foray into politics was his stint as a lawmaker. An heir to a fortune built on the banana trade, Noboa opened an event organizing company when he was 18 and then joined his fathers Noboa Corp., where he held management positions in the shipping, logistics and commercial areas. González, 47, held various government jobs during the presidency of Correa, who led Ecuador from 2007 through 2017 with free-spending socially conservative policies and grew increasingly authoritarian in his last years as president. Noboa, 37, declared Ecuador to be in a state of internal armed conflict in January 2024, allowing him to deploy thousands of soldiers to the streets to combat gangs and to charge people with terrorism counts for alleged ties to organized crime groups. Under his watch, the homicide rate dropped from 46.18 per 100,000 people in 2023, to 38.76 per 100,000 people in 2024. But despite the decrease, the rate remained far higher than the 6.85 homicides per 100,000 people seen in 2019. Some of Noboas heavy-handed crime-fighting tactics have come under scrutiny for testing the limits of laws and norms of governing. He has also been criticized for allegations of electoral irregularities he made after Februarys vote. Following the first-round election, Noboa said there had been many irregularities and that in certain provinces there were things that didnt add up. He provided no further details or evidence. Electoral observers from the Organization of American States and the European Union ruled out fraud. As González walked through the streets of Canuto, a town in the coastal province of Manabí where she grew up, to reach her voting center, supporters shouted Luisa is the people. We have all united to rewrite the history of Ecuador, she told people Sunday before denouncing reports of attempts to plant marked ballots with her name. Source: AP --Agencies",

        "content": "An earthquake of magnitude 6.3 on the Richter Scale struck South of the Fiji Islands on Monday, a statement by Indias National Center for Seismology (NCS) said. As per the NCS, the earthquake occurred at a depth of 10km, making it susceptible to aftershocks. In a post on X, the NCS said, EQ of M: 6.3, On: 14042025 01:32:52 IST, Lat: 25.87 S, Long: 178.18 W, Depth: 10 Km, Location: South of Fiji Islands. Shallow earthquakes are more dangerous than deeper ones due to their greater energy release closer to the Earths surface, causing stronger ground shaking and increased damage to structures and casualties, compared to deeper earthquakes, which lose energy as they travel to the surface. The south of the Fiji Islands is known to be earthquake-prone, as evidenced by recent seismic activity and historical records. This region is located within the Fiji Seismic Zone, an area known for frequent earthquakes. Fiji is situated within the Circum-Pacific Seismic Belt, commonly known as the Ring of Fire which is a region of high seismic activity. This zone experiences numerous earthquakes, including some of significant magnitude. The belt exists along boundaries of tectonic plates, where plates of mostly oceanic crust are sinking (or subducting) beneath another plate. Earthquakes in these subduction zones are caused by slip between plates and rupture within plates. Fiji has a history of earthquakes, with some causing substantial damage and disruption. The Mineral Resources Department (MRD) of Fiji documents various earthquakes and their impacts, highlighting the ongoing seismic risk in the region. The Republic of Fiji and, in particular, its capital city of Suva are considered to be very vulnerable. Indeed, recent history attests to this, with the memory of the devastating September 14, 1953 Suva earthquake (Richter Magnitude ML 6.5) and its associated tsunami. (ANI) --Agencies",

        "title": "Katy Perry to fly into space with Blue Origins all-women crew today",
        "date": "April 14, 2025 12:29 pm",
        "content": "Pop star Katy Perry will be the biggest name in an all-female group set to touch the edge of space Monday, roaring into the cosmos on one of billionaire Jeff Bezos rockets. The Firework and California Gurls singer will be lofted more than 100 kilometers (60 miles) above the Earths surface in a vessel from Blue Origin, the space company owned by the Amazon founder. Five other women including Bezos fiancee Lauren Sanchez will join the flight, slated to blast off from western Texas at around 8:30 am (1330 GMT). Their fully automated craft will rise vertically before the crew capsule detaches mid-flight, later falling back to the ground slowed by parachutes and a retro rocket. Mondays mission is the first all-female space crew since Valentina Tereshkovas historic solo flight in 1963. It is also the 11th sub-orbital crewed operation by Blue Origin, which has offered the space tourism experiences for several years. The company does not publicly communicate the price of trips made possible by its New Shepard rocket. Lasting around 10 minutes, the flight will bring the passengers beyond the Karman line -- the internationally recognized boundary of space. There will be a brief period when the women can unbuckle from their seats and float in zero gravity. Inspiration Perry recently told Elle magazine that she was taking part for my daughter Daisy, whom she shares with actor Orlando Bloom, to inspire her to never have limits on her dreams. Im just so excited to see the inspiration through her eyes and the light in her eyes when she sees that rocket go, and she goes back to school the next day and says Mom went to space, Perry added. Perry, launched onto the international stage with her 2008 hit I Kissed a Girl, will sit alongside TV presenter Gayle King, film producer Kerianne Flynn, former NASA scientist Aisha Bowe and Amanda Nguyen, founder of a campaign group against sexual violence. They follow 52 previous Blue Origin passengers, including longtime Star Trek leading man William Shatner. Such high-profile guests are intended to keep public interest in Blue Origins work, as it battles multiple rival firms in the space tourism field. Bezos top challenger in passenger flights is Virgin Galactic, which offers a similar sub-orbital experience. But Blue Origin aims in future to bring space tourists into orbit, competing directly with Elon Musks SpaceX. In January, Blue Origins much more powerful New Glenn rocket successfully completed its first unmanned orbital mission. Source: AFP --Agencies",

Dr. Deepal Perera, a specialist at the Lady Ridgeway Hospital for Children (LRH), said that annually, the number of accidents involving children increases sharply during the New Year holiday period. A large number of children are hospitalized during the festive period owing to firecracker-related incidents and road accidents, he added. Dr. Perera, therefore, said parents and guardians must be on alert at all times. He also highlighted the increase in the number of road accidents due to drunk-driving, which is a serious concern, especially during New Year holidays. Separately, Dr. Deepal Perera indicated that a considerable number of children get affected by diarrhea during this period. Parents must be mindful about what food their children consume, he stressed. Dr. Perera said that since warm weather is continuing in the country, children who partake in New Year games must ensure they drink adequate water to prevent dehydration.

        "title": "Tariffs on imported semiconductor chips coming soon, Trump says",
        "date": "April 14, 2025 03:02 pm",
        "content": "U.S. President Donald Trump has said he would be announcing the tariff rate on imported semiconductors over the next week, adding that there would be flexibility with some companies in the sector. The presidents pledge means that the exclusion of smartphones and computers from his reciprocal tariffs on China likely will be short-lived as Trump looks to reset trade in the semiconductor sector. We wanted to uncomplicate it from a lot of other companies, because we want to make our chips and semiconductors and other things in our country, Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One as he traveled back to Washington from his estate in West Palm Beach. Trump declined to say whether some products such as smartphones might still end up being exempted, but added: You have to show a certain flexibility. Nobody should be so rigid. Earlier in the day, Trump announced a national security trade probe into the semiconductor sector. We are taking a look at Semiconductors and the WHOLE ELECTRONICS SUPPLY CHAIN in the upcoming National Security Tariff Investigations, he posted on social media. The White House had announced the exclusions from steep reciprocal tariffs on Friday, creating some hope that the tech industry might escape being ensnared in the escalating conflict between the two nations and that everyday consumer products such as phones and laptops would remain affordable. However, Trumps commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, earlier on Sunday made clear that critical technology products from China would face separate new duties along with semiconductors within the next two months. Trumps back-and-forth on tariffs last week triggered the wildest swings on Wall Street since the COVID pandemic of 2020. The benchmark Standard  Poors 500 index (.SPX), opens new tab is down more than 10 since Trump took office on January 20. Lutnick said Trump would enact a special focus-type of tariff on smartphones, computers and other electronics products in a month or two, alongside sectoral tariffs targeting semiconductors and pharmaceuticals. The new duties would fall outside Trumps so-called reciprocal tariffs, under which levies on Chinese imports climbed to 125 last week, he said. Hes saying theyre exempt from the reciprocal tariffs, but theyre included in the semiconductor tariffs, which are coming in probably a month or two, Lutnick said in an interview on ABCs This Week, predicting the levies would bring production of those products to the United States. Beijing increased its own tariffs on U.S. imports to 125 on Friday in response. On Sunday, before Lutnicks comments, China said it was evaluating the impact of the exclusions for the technology products implemented late on Friday. The bell on a tigers neck can only be untied by the person who tied it, Chinas Ministry of Commerce said. Billionaire investor Bill Ackman, who endorsed Trumps run for president but who has criticized the tariffs, on Sunday called on him to pause the broad and steep reciprocal tariffs on China for three months, as Trump did for most countries last week. If Trump paused Chinese tariffs for 90 days and cut them to 10 temporarily, he would achieve the same objective in causing U.S. businesses to relocate their supply chains from China without the disruption and risk, Ackman wrote on X.

        "content": "A rare piece of Indias royal heritage, The Golconda Blue -- a historic diamond once owned by the Maharajas of Indore and Baroda -- is set to make its auction debut at the Christies Magnificent Jewels sale in Geneva on May 14. The 23.24-carat vivid blue diamond, mounted in a striking modern ring by celebrated Parisian designer JAR, is expected to fetch an estimated value between USD 35 and USD 50 million. Hailed as one of the most important and rarest blue diamonds ever discovered, what makes the auction more significant for Indian audiences is its direct lineage to Indian royalty -- and its origins in the legendary Golconda mines of present-day Telangana, renowned for producing the worlds most iconic diamonds. According to Christies, The Golconda Blue once belonged to Maharaja Yeshwant Rao Holkar II of Indore, a modernist monarch celebrated for his refined taste and cosmopolitan lifestyle during the 1920s and 30s. In 1923, the Maharajas father commissioned a bracelet featuring this extraordinary blue diamond from the French house Chaumet, after he had earlier acquired the famed Indore Pears -- the two significant Golconda diamonds -- from the same jeweller, they informed. A decade later, the Maharaja appointed Mauboussin as his official jeweler, who redesigned the royal collection and incorporated The Golconda Blue into a striking necklace alongside the famed Indore Pear diamonds. In 1947, the diamond was acquired by famed New York jeweler Harry Winston, who set it in a brooch with a matching white diamond of equal size. That brooch later found its way to the Maharaja of Baroda, continuing its journey through Indias royal lineage before passing into private hands. Source: Press Trust of India --Agencies",

        "content": "Ukraines President Volodymyr Zelensky has invited Donald Trump to visit his country before any deal is struck with Russia to end the war. Please, before any kind of decisions, any kind of forms of negotiations, come to see people, civilians, warriors, hospitals, churches, children destroyed or dead, Zelensky said in an interview for CBSs 60 Minutes programme. The interview was recorded before a Russian missile hit the city of Sumy on Sunday, killing 34 people and injuring 117 others. Without providing evidence, Russia said it fired two Iskander missiles at a meeting of Ukrainian soldiers, killing 60 of them. Trump said he had been told it was a mistake, without specifying who told him. At the scene in Sumy, the conference centre Russia claimed was used for the meeting is smashed, and a crater marks the spot where a missile hit. The roof is no more. Kyiv has not confirmed the gathering of military officers  however, a regional mayor in Sumy has demanded the resignation of local security officials if indeed they allowed such a meeting to happen. Any gathering of soldiers is a prime target for Russia. In previous attacks and indeed throughout the invasion of Ukraine, civilians have been seen as acceptable collateral damage by the Russian military. The attack comes as the US, Ukraines strongest military ally, has been pursuing an end to the war - now in its fourth year - through negotiation under Trump. Asked about the attack, the US president said it was terrible and that he had been told they made a mistake, but did not elaborate. Earlier, Trumps special envoy to Ukraine, retired Lt-Gen Keith Kellogg, said the attack had crossed any line of decency. However, it remains to be seen if Trump will accept Zelenskys invitation. Scott Bessent, the US treasury secretary, is the only senior member of Trumps team to visit Kyiv, and that was to demand Zelensky sign a contract heavily weighted in Washingtons favour to trade Ukraines mineral wealth for continued military aid. Zelensky refused. The Ukrainian president has highlighted Russias continued attacks on civilians while Trump attempts to improve relations with Moscow in search of a ceasefire. US special envoy Steve Witkoff has already held three meetings with Vladimir Putin, and Kyiv is adamant Moscow will exploit this as it continues to erode Ukraines territory. European leaders condemned the Sumy attack. Germanys chancellor-in-waiting, Friedrich Merz, told the countrys public broadcaster ARD the attack constituted a serious war crime. It was a perfidious act.. and it is a serious war crime, deliberate and intended, the conservative politician said. Germanys outgoing Chancellor Olaf Scholz, meanwhile, said the attack showed just what Russias supposed readiness for peace was worth. French President Emmanuel Macron accused Russia of blatant disregard of human lives, international law, and the diplomatic efforts of President Trump. Strong measures are needed to impose a ceasefire on Russia, he said. France is working tirelessly toward this goal, alongside its partners. Describing the attack as barbaric, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen added: Russia was and remains the aggressor, in blatant violation of international law. Strong measures are urgently needed to enforce a ceasefire. Europe will continue to reach out to partners and maintain strong pressure on Russia until the bloodshed ends and a just and lasting peace is achieved, on Ukraines terms and conditions. British Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer also gave a view, saying he was appalled at Russias horrific attacks on civilians in Sumy. A spokesperson for UN Secretary-General António Guterres said he was deeply alarmed and shocked to learn of the missile attack. Attacks against civilians and civilian objects are prohibited under international humanitarian law, and that any such attacks, wherever they occur, must end immediately, he added. Guterres stressed the UNs support for meaningful efforts towards a just, lasting and comprehensive peace that fully upholds Ukraines sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity. Sundays double missile strike was the deadliest attack on civilians in Ukraine this year. Another Russian missile attack, earlier this month on 4 April, killed 20 people and injured 61 in the city of Kryvyi Rih. On that occasion, Russias defence ministry said it had targeted a meeting of unit commanders and Western instructors in a restaurant. No evidence was provided. It is estimated that hundreds of thousands of people - the vast majority of them soldiers - have been killed or injured on all sides since Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022. The UN estimates that nearly seven million Ukrainians are currently living as refugees. The conflict goes back more than a decade, to 2014, when Ukraines pro-Russian president was overthrown. Russia then annexed the Black Sea peninsula of Crimea and backed insurgents in bloody fighting in eastern Ukraine. Source: BBC --Agencies",

        "title": "El Salvadors Bukele says he will not return man the US mistakenly deported",
        "date": "April 15, 2025 08:29 am",
        "content": "El Salvador President Nayib Bukele said at the White House on Monday he had no plans to return a man mistakenly deported from the United States, suggesting that doing so would be like smuggling a terrorist into the country. His remarks came during an Oval Office meeting where multiple officials in President Donald Trumps administration said they were not required to bring back Salvadoran Kilmar Abrego Garcia, despite a U.S. Supreme Court order saying they must facilitate the Maryland residents return. Abrego Garcias case has drawn attention as the Trump administration has deported hundreds of people to El Salvador with help from Bukele, whose country is receiving 6 million to house the migrants in a high-security mega-prison. The U.S. government has described his deportation as an administrative error. But in court filings and at the White House on Monday, the administration indicated it does not plan to ask for Abrego Garcia back, raising questions about whether it is defying the courts. Bukele told reporters he did not have the power to return Abrego Garcia to the U.S. The question is preposterous. How can I smuggle a terrorist into the United States? Bukele said, echoing the Trump administrations claim that Abrego Garcia is a member of the MS-13 gang. Bukeles comments came shortly after U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi said at the same meeting that the U.S. needed only to provide a plane if Bukele wanted to return Abrego Garcia. Abrego Garcias lawyers have denied the allegation he is a gang member, saying the U.S. has presented no credible evidence. The U.S. sent Abrego Garcia to El Salvador on March 15. Trump called reporters asking whether the administration would follow the order for his return sick people. The foreign policy of the United States is conducted by the president of the United States, not by a court, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said during the Oval Office meeting. Mega-Prison Trump said he would send as many people living in the U.S. illegally to El Salvador as possible and help Bukele build new prisons. The U.S. on Saturday deported 10 more people to El Salvador it alleges are gang mem In a Monday court filing, a U.S. Department of Homeland Security official said the agency does not have authority to forcibly extract an alien from the domestic custody of a foreign sovereign nation. The migrants El Salvador accepts from the U.S. are housed in a facility known as the Terrorism Confinement Center, opens new tab. Critics say the prison engages in human rights abuses and that Bukeles crackdown on gangs has swept up many innocent people without due process. Bukele told Trump he is accused of imprisoning thousands of people. I like to say that we actually liberated millions, he said. The U.S. president reacted gleefully to Bukeles comment. Do you think I can use that? Trump asked. The State Department last week lifted its advisory for American travelers to El Salvador to the safest level, crediting Bukele for reducing gang activity and violent crime. Lawyers and relatives of the migrants held in El Salvador say they are not gang members and had no opportunity to contest the U.S. government assertion that they were. The Trump administration says it vetted migrants to ensure they belonged to gangs including Tren de Aragua and MS-13, which it labels terrorist organizations. Last month, after a judge said flights carrying migrants processed under the 1798 Alien Enemies Act should return to the U.S., Bukele wrote Oopsie... Too late on social media alongside footage showing men being hustled off a plane at night. Tuesday Hearing An immigration judge had previously granted Abrego Garcia protection from being deported to El Salvador, finding that he could face gang violence there. He held a permit to work in the U.S., where he had lived since 2011. The U.S. Supreme Court last week upheld a lower court ruling directing the administration to facilitate and effectuate his return. But it said the term effectuate was unclear and might exceed the authority of the district court judge. A hearing is scheduled for Tuesday. Legal experts said Judge Paula Xinis may press the Trump administration to determine if it signaled to Bukele that he should refuse to release Abrego Garcia, which could amount to defiance of the court orders language to facilitate his return. While the Supreme Court in its decision ordered Xinis to clarify her order with due regard for the deference owed to the executive branch in the conduct of foreign affairs, some legal experts said Trump is likely defying the court by undermining Abrego Garcias release. All that is total claptrap as applied to a case like this, where the only reason why the foreign country is holding the person is because the U.S. pushed them to do it and made an agreement under which they would do it, George Mason University constitutional law professor Ilya Somin said. Its very obvious that they could get him released if they wanted to. Trump told reporters on Friday that his administration would bring the man back if the Supreme Court directed it to do so.
