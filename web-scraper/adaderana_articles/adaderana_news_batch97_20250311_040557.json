According to the Navy, the apprehensions were made during a special operation carried out between the late hours of Saturday night (09 March) and in the early hours of today (10 March). As an extension of the regular operations conducted to curb illegal fishing practices by foreign fishing trawlers in Sri Lankan waters, the Northern Naval Command deployed a Fast Attack Craft to chase away a cluster of Indian poaching trawlers, having spotted they were engaging in illegal fishing in local waters off the Kovilan Lighthouse. The operation resulted in the seizure of three Indian poaching trawlers and the apprehension of 22 Indian fishermen, who were subsequently brought to the Kankesanthurai Harbour and are due to be handed over to the Mailadi Fisheries Inspector for onward legal proceedings. With this recent apprehension, the Navy has seized a total of 15 Indian poaching trawlers and 110 Indian fishermen in Sri Lankan waters in 2024 thus far.

        "title": "Pope Francis white flag comment is met by criticism from Ukraine and its allies",
        "date": "March 10, 2024 09:54 pm",
        "content": "Ukrainian and allied officials criticized Pope Francis for saying that Kyiv should have the courage to negotiate an end to the war with Russia, a statement many interpreted as a call for Ukraine to surrender. The foreign minister of Poland, a vocal ally of Kyiv, and Ukraines ambassador to the Vatican, both used World War II analogies to condemn the popes remarks. And a leader of one of Ukraines Christian churches on Sunday said that only the countrys determined resistance to Moscows full-scale invasion, launched by Russian President Vladimir Putin on Feb. 24, 2022, had prevented a mass slaughter of civilians. In an interview recorded last month with Swiss broadcaster RSI and partially released on Saturday, Francis used the phrase the courage of the white flag as he argued that Ukraine, facing a possible defeat, should be open to peace talks brokered by international powers. How about, for balance, encouraging Putin to have the courage to withdraw his army from Ukraine? Peace would immediately ensue without the need for negotiations, Polish Foreign Minister Radek Sikorski responded with a post on X, formerly Twitter. In a separate post, Sikorski drew parallels between those calling for negotiations while denying (Ukraine) the means to defend itself and European leaders appeasement of Adolf Hitler just before World War II. Andrii Yurash, Ukraines ambassador to the Holy See, said that it was necessary to learn lessons from that conflict. His tweet appeared to compare the popes comments to calls for talking with Hitler while raising a white flag to satisfy him. Vatican spokesman Matteo Bruni later clarified that the pope supported a stop to hostilities (and) a truce achieved with the courage of negotiations, rather than an outright Ukrainian surrender. Bruni said that the journalist interviewing Francis used the term white flag in the question that prompted the controversial remarks. I think that the strongest one is the one who looks at the situation, thinks about the people and has the courage of the white flag, and negotiates, Francis said, when asked to weigh in on the debate between those who say that Ukraine should agree to peace talks and those who argue that any negotiations would legitimize Moscows aggression. Kyiv remains firm on not engaging directly with Russia on peace talks, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said multiple times that the initiative in peace negotiations must come from the country that has been invaded. Throughout the war, Francis has tried to maintain the Vaticans traditional diplomatic neutrality, but that has often been accompanied by apparent sympathy with the Russian rationale for invading Ukraine, such as when he noted that NATO was barking at Russias door with its eastward expansion. While the pope has spoken in the past about the need for talks between Kyiv and Moscow, the RSI interview appears to mark the first time when he publicly used terms such as white flag or defeated while discussing the war. In the RSI interview, Francis insisted that negotiations are never a surrender. When you see that you are defeated, that things are not going well, you have to have the courage to negotiate, he said. Archbishop Sviatoslav Shevchuk, the head of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church, said Sunday that surrender isnt on the minds of Ukrainians. Ukraine is wounded, but unconquered! Ukraine is exhausted, but it stands and will endure. Believe me, it never crosses anyones mind to surrender. Even where there is fighting today: listen to our people in Kherson, Zaporizhzhia, Odesa, Kharkiv, Sumy, Shevchuk said while meeting with Ukrainians in New York City. He mentioned the regions that have been under heavy Russian artillery and drone attacks. Shevchuk also spoke of the brutality of Moscows invasion, referencing the town near Kyiv where Russian occupation left hundreds of civilians dead in the streets and in mass graves. He argued that, if not for Ukrainians fierce resistance as Russian forces marched on the capital in February 2022, the gruesome scenes seen in Bucha would have been just an introduction. During the Angelus prayer on Sunday from the window overlooking St. Peters Square, Francis said that he was praying for peace in the tormented Ukraine and in the Holy Land. Let the hostilities which cause immense suffering among the civilian population cease as soon as possible, he said. Elsewhere, both Ukraine and Russia reported civilian deaths on Sunday after overnight trading drone, missile and shelling attacks that also caused a fire at a Russian oil depot and targeted Ukrainian power stations, according to officials. Ukrainian air defenses overnight shot down 35 out of 39 drones launched by Russia, air force commander Mykola Oleshchuk reported, following a 4½-hour barrage that officials said damaged unspecified industrial sites in southern Ukraine and also targeted power stations. Two people died under rubble after Iranian-made Shahed drones around midnight struck private homes and state offices in Dobropillya, a large Ukrainian-held town in the east, authorities said. In Myrnohrad, another eastern Ukrainian town, 11 civilians were wounded after Russian missiles overnight struck residential buildings, the local prosecutors office reported. It also posted photos of rubble lining the courtyard outside a high-rise apartment building, its windows blown out, and of cars parked outside that appeared reduced to piles of twisted metal. A woman also died in Russias Kursk region, which borders Ukraine, after shells fired from Ukraine set her house on fire, according to local Gov. Roman Starovoit, who also said that the womans husband suffered severe burns. Starovoit also said that debris from a downed Ukrainian drone sparked a fire at an oil depot in the Kursk region. Nine Ukrainian drones targeted the Belgorod region, another southern Russian province that borders Ukraine, overnight and on Sunday, according to local Gov. Vyacheslav Gladkov. Later Sunday, Russias Defense Ministry said that two drones were shot down over the Novgorod region in northern Russia, more than 1,000 kilometers (620 miles) from the Ukrainian border. There were no immediate reports of casualties. Source  AP News - Agencies",

        "title": "Palestinians prepare for Ramadan in the shadow of Gaza war",
        "date": "March 10, 2024 11:21 pm",
        "content": "(Reuters) - Palestinians prepared for Ramadan in sombre mood with heightened security measures by Israeli police and the spectre of war and hunger in Gaza overshadowing the normally festive Muslim holy month as talks to secure a ceasefire stalled. Thousands of police have been deployed around the narrow streets of the Old City in Jerusalem, where tens of thousands of worshippers are expected every day at the Al Aqsa mosque compound, one of the holiest sites in Islam. The area, considered the most sacred place by Jews who know it as Temple Mount, has been a longstanding flashpoint for trouble and was one of the starting points of the last war in 2021 between Israel and Hamas, the Islamist movement that controls Gaza. That 10-day conflict has been dwarfed by the current war, which is now in its sixth month. It began on Oct. 7 when thousands of Hamas fighters stormed into Israel, killing some 1,200 people, by Israeli tallies. Israels relentless campaign in Gaza has caused increasing alarm across the world as the growing risk of famine threatens to add to a death toll that has already passed 31,000. After some confusion last month when hard-right Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir said he wanted restrictions on worshippers at Al Aqsa, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the numbers admitted would be similar to last year. This is our mosque and we must take care of it, said Azzam Al-Khatib, director general of the Jerusalem Waqf, the religious foundation that oversees Al Aqsa. We must protect the presence of Muslims at this mosque, who should be able to enter in big numbers peacefully and safely. The start of Ramadan depends on lunar observations - for Palestinians it will begin on Monday, while it will start on Tuesday in some Arab and Muslim countries. In contrast to previous years, the usual decorations around the Old City have not been put up and there was a similar sombre tone in towns across the occupied West Bank, where around 400 Palestinians have been killed in clashes with security forces or Jewish settlers since the start of the Gaza war. We decided this year that the Old City of Jerusalem wont be decorated out of respect for the blood of our children and the elders and the martyrs, said Ammar Sider, a community leader in the Old City. Police said they were working to ensure a peaceful Ramadan and had taken extra measures to crack down on what they described as provocative and distorted information on social media networks and had arrested 20 people suspected of incitement to terrorism. The Israel Police will continue to act and allow for the observance of Ramadan prayers safely on the Temple Mount, while maintaining security and safety in the area, police said in a statement. For the rest of the Muslim world, Israels policing of Al Aqsa has long been among the most bitterly resented issues and last month, Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh called on Palestinians to march to the mosque at the start of Ramadan. Last year, clashes that erupted when police entered the mosque compound drew condemnation from the Arab League as well as Saudi Arabia, with which Israel had been seeking to normalise diplomatic ties, extending its push to build ties with regional powers including the United Arab Emirates. CEASEFIRE HOPES Hopes for a ceasefire, which would have allowed Ramadan to pass peacefully and enabled the return of at least some of the 134 Israeli hostages held in Gaza, appear to have been disappointed with talks in Cairo apparently stalled. A Hamas official told Reuters the group was open to more negotiations but, as far as he knew, no dates had been set for further meetings with mediators in Cairo. In the ruins of Gaza itself, where half the 2.3 million population is squeezed into the southern city of Rafah, many living under plastic tents and facing a severe shortage of food, the mood was correspondingly sombre. We made no preparations to welcome Ramadan because we have been fasting for five months now, said Maha, a mother of five, who would normally have filled her home with decorations and stocked her refrigerator with supplies for the evening Iftar celebrations when people break their fast. There is no food, we only have some canned food and rice, most of the food items are being sold for imaginary high prices, she said via chat app from Rafah, where she is sheltering with her family. Philippe Lazzarini, head of the U.N. Palestinian refugee agency UNRWA, said in a post on X that the month of Ramadan should bring a ceasefire for those who have suffered the most but instead for Gazans it comes as extreme hunger spreads, displacement continues  fear  anxiety prevail amid threats of a military operation on Rafah. In the southern Gaza town of Al-Mawasi, Palestinian health officials said 13 people were killed in an Israeli military strike on a tented area where thousands of displaced people were taking shelter. There was no immediate Israeli comment. In the West Bank, which has seen record violence for more than two years and a further surge since the war in Gaza, the stakes are also high, with Jenin, Tulkarm, Nablus and other volatile towns braced for further clashes. In Israel, fears of car ramming or stabbing attacks by Palestinians have also led to heightened security preparations. For many Gazans, there is little alternative but to hope for peace. Ramadan is a blessed month despite the fact this year is not like every year, but we are steadfast and patient, and we will welcome the month of Ramadan as usual, with decorations, songs, with prayers, fasting, said Nehad El-Jed, who was displaced with her family in Gaza. Next Ramadan, we wish for Gaza to come back, hopefully all the destruction and the siege in Gaza will change, and all will come back in a better condition. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "date": "March 11, 2024 08:17 am",
        "content": "(Reuters) - Oppenheimer, the blockbuster biopic about the race to build the first atomic bomb, claimed the prestigious best picture trophy at the Academy Awards on Sunday. Director Christopher Nolans film starred Irish actor Cillian Murphy as theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer, leader of the U.S. effort in the 1940s to create a weapon devastating enough to end World War Two. Murphy won the best actor trophy, and Nolan was named best director. Emma Stone won best actress for Poor Things. A three-hour historical drama about science and politics, Oppenheimer became an unlikely box office hit and grossed 953.8 million, in addition to widespread critical praise. It was the first of Nolans films to win best picture. The director has previously won acclaim for The Dark Knight Batman trilogy, Inception, Memento and other movies. Oppenheimer triumphed over feminist doll adventure Barbie, a movie it had battled in a box office showdown dubbed Barbenheimer. Other best picture contenders included The Holdovers, a dramedy set in a New England boarding school, and the Holocaust tale The Zone of Interest. In supporting actor categories, Robert Downey Jr. of Oppenheimer and The Holdovers star DaVine Joy Randolph claimed their firstAcademy Awards. Downey, who was nominated for an Oscar in 1993 before his career was derailed by drug use, won his honor for playing Oppenheimers professional nemesis. Id like to thank my terrible childhood and the Academy, in that order, Downey joked before he saluted his wife Susan, who he said found him as a snarly rescue pet and loved him back to life. Randolph won the best supporting actress trophy for playing a grieving mother and cafeteria worker in the comedy set in a New England boarding school. She shed tears as she accepted her award. For so long, I always wanted to be different, and now I realize I just need to be myself, she said. I thank you for seeing me. British Holocaust drama The Zone of Interest was named best international feature. Director Jonathan Glazer addressed the Israel-Gaza conflict in his acceptance speech. Right now we stand here as men who refute their Jewishness and the Holocaust being hijacked by an occupation which has led to conflict for so many innocent people. Whether the victims of October the 7th in Israel or the ongoing attack on Gaza. All the victims of this dehumanization. How do we resist? he said to cheers and applause. The Boy and the Heron, Japanese director Hayao Miyazakis semi-autobiographical film about grief, was named best animated feature. Winners were chosen by the roughly 10,500 members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts  Sciences. JIMMY KIMMEL COMPLIMENTS, TAKES JABS AT ACTORS Talk show host Jimmy Kimmel, hosting the show for the fourth time, opened the ceremony by complimenting, and taking jabs at, many of the nominees and their films. The comedian praised Barbie, the pink-drenched doll adventure, for remaking a plastic doll nobody even liked anymore into a feminist icon. Before the film, there was a better chance of getting my wife to buy our daughter a pack of Marlboro Reds than a Barbie, Kimmel said on the broadcast, which was shown live on the U.S. ABC network. Kimmel said many of this years movies were too long, particularly Martin Scorseses 3-12-hour epic Killer of the Flower Moon about the murders of members of the Osage Nation in 1920s Oklahoma. In the time it takes you to watch it, you could drive to Oklahoma and solve the murders, Kimmel joked. As the stars celebrated, hundreds of pro-Palestinian protesters angered by the Israel-Gaza conflict shouted and slowed traffic in the streets surrounding the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood. While youre watching, bombs are dropping, one sign read. The Oscars are happening down the road while people are being murdered, killed, bombed, said 38-year-old business owner Zinab Nassrou. At the awards venue, a handful of celebrities, including Mahershala Ali and singer Billie Eilish, wore red pins calling for a ceasefire in Gaza. Actor Mark Ruffalo praised the protesters as he entered the theater and raised a clenched fist. We need peace, he said. Elsewhere on the carpet, stars strutted in strong silhouettes, sparkles and a splash of Barbie-inspired pink. Source: Reuters --Agecies",

        "content": "Notorious underworld figure Nadun Chithaka Wickremeratne, alias Harak Kata, has been further remanded until 26 April over his failed escape attempt from the Criminal Investigation Department (CID). The relevant order was issued by the Colombo High Court Judge Damith Thotawatte. Accordingly, Harak Kata will be detained at the old prison complex in Tangalle, which currently operates as a detention centre. Earlier today (11 March), Harak Kata was produced before the Colombo Fort Magistrates Court, after which he was produced before the Colombo High Court following a request made by the CID. On 10 September 2023, Harak Kata, who was being interrogated by eight CID officers, had reportedly laced the officers teas with poison during his questioning, with the help of a Police Constable. During the questioning, Harak Kata had allegedly requested to go to the washroom and was escorted out of the interrogation room with his accomplice  the police constable, and another sub-inspector attached to the Police Special Task Force (STF), assigned for the suspects protection. Although his handcuffs were removed at that point, the underworld kingpin had then walked out of the washroom acting as if he was still cuffed and had then attempted to snatch the STF officers firearm leading to a scuffle. A group of other CID officers were quick to arrive at the scene, upon hearing the commotion and managed to detain Harak Kata in their custody.",

Accordingly, Kudu Salindu was further remanded until 25 March as per an order issued by Panadura Chief Magistrate Champika Rajapaksha. Salindu Malshitha Gunaratne is currently in the custody of the Criminal Investigation Department (CID), after he was arrested in Madagascar in March 2023. Nadun Chinthaka Wickremeratne alias Harak Kata and his infamous accomplice Salindu Malshika alias Kudu Salindu were arrested in Madagascar on March 01 last year in a joint operation by the INTERPOL and Malagasy law enforcement authorities and Customs officials. The duo was brought back to the island on March 15 after Malagasy defence officials informed the Sri Lankan Foreign Ministry of the arrest of 8 suspects including the two Sri Lankan underworld figures. The extradition process had been coordinated by the Sri Lankan High Commission in Victoria, Seychelles, as Sri Lanka does not have an embassy or a high commission in Madagascar.",

Failure to do so, he warned, could jeopardize the jobs of approximately 6,000 employees. In line with the Presidents proposal, the government has committed to relieving a portion of the national carriers debt, totaling USD510 million out of USD 1.2 billion owed to various banks and institutions. With a solid financial footing anticipated, the airline has outlined plans for a comprehensive restructuring process within the stipulated timeframe of six months. To achieve this objective, Minister de Silva emphasized the imperative need to curtail unnecessary expenses and instill robust financial discipline within the company. He urged close collaboration between management and trade unions to accomplish these goals effectively. In response, company authorities disclosed that the airline currently operates 16 aircraft, facilitating six long-haul and 29 short-haul flights. Additionally, they revealed the acquisition of three Belgian aircraft and one Fit Air aircraft on lease to support operational needs.",

        "date": "March 11, 2024 04:28 pm",
        "content": "Indian Minister of Commerce and Industry Piyush Goyal has revealed that many developed and developing countries including Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, and nations of the Gulf region are keen to start trade in rupee with India as it would help cut transaction costs for business. He expressed confidence that the development is going to be a very game-changing dimension to Indias international trade. Bangladesh, Sri Lanka are already talking to us and they want us to start this immediately. Other countries in the Gulf region are looking at that. I think itll take some time for people to see the benefits. And then well have more and more developed countries and countries in the Far East also joining the bandwagon. Singapore is already on board to some extent, he said. The minister added that gradually countries are realising that undertaking trade in domestic currencies has several advantages. The minister said that it is now picking up traction and a lot of countries have come forward for this arrangement and are talking to India for that as they would also like to initiate direct transactions between their local currency and the rupee. Gradually the conscience is setting in that rather than converting all the transactions into a third currency, both ways, adds significantly to transaction costs, Goyal told PTI in an interview. Undertaking trade in other currencies leads to foreign exchange and transaction losses as there is a cost for conversion. The delays in the movement of money also pushed transactors costs. We started with the UAE. The UAE was one of the first countries to accept this. Its now picking up traction. We get a lot of countries who come and talk to us that they would like to also initiate direct transactions between the local currency and the rupee. Its a process which takes time. It involves the central bankers of both nations to create the framework and then it evolves acceptance by importers and exporters, Goyal said, adding when it will take off, itll just fly. The engagement is also beneficial as the Indian Rupee is mostly stable against most of the international currencies and according to experts, this is one of the reasons that different nations today want to have trade relations built on rupee trade. The rupee trade is also helping many of the countries, which have dollar shortages. India has started trade in the rupee with neighbouring countries, including Nepal and Bhutan. The rupee trade mechanism has been initiated to facilitate trade in national currency with Russia, while Sri Lanka has included the rupee in its list of designated foreign currencies. Indias first-ever payment in rupees for crude oil purchased was from the UAE and that is helping the worlds third largest energy consumer to push for taking the local currency global, as it looks for similar deals with other suppliers. Changes have been made in the FTP (Foreign Trade Policy) to allow international trade settlement in Indian Rupee with a view to making INR a global currency. In July 2022, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) decided to allow the settlement of Indias international trade in rupee. Accordingly, authorised Indian banks are permitted to open and maintain special rupee Vostro accounts of the partner trading countrys banks. These accounts keep the foreign banks holdings in the Indian counterpart in rupees. When an Indian trader wants to make a payment to a foreign trader in rupees, the amount will be credited to this Vostro account. Similarly, in the reverse scenario, the amount to be paid to an Indian trader is deducted from the Vostro account, and credited to the persons regular account. Several banks, including HDFC Bank and UCO Bank, have opened special Vostro accounts to facilitate overseas trade in the rupee and many countries have expressed interest to have this arrangement for the local currency trade.

        "date": "March 11, 2024 06:08 pm",
        "content": "US Ambassador to Sri Lanka Julie Chung has asserted that the United States will continue to monitor legislative developments in Sri Lanka that could challenge its progress on human rights, reconciliation, and civic space. Taking to X (formerly Twitter), the diplomat highlighted that the joint statement issued by the Core Group earlier this month at the 55th Session of the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC), along with other statements made by local and international organizations, underscore shared concerns, notably that Sri Lankas much-disputed Online Safety Act could be used to criminalize a wide range of expression, suppress dissent, and undermine Sri Lankas digital economy. Speaking in this vein, Ambassador Chung urged for comprehensive consultations to be made between the Government of Sri Lanka and other stakeholders, including civil society, prior to the enactment of any legislation with potentially serious implications for fundamental freedoms and civic space in the future, and that the due legislative process be followed in this regard. On 04 March, the Core Group on Sri Lanka, at the 55th Session of the UHRC raised concerns with regards to several legislative developments regarding human rights, reconciliation and civic space. In a joint statement, the Core Group, comprising of Canada, Malawi, Montenegro, North Macedonia, the United Kingdom and the United States of America, noted that certain legislative developments imposed recently have given cause for concern. As such, they noted that the Online Safety Act has the potential to severely restrict online communication, and could potentially criminalise nearly all forms of expression, creating an environment that has a chilling effect on freedom of expression. Thus, the Core Group urged the Sri Lankan Government to enact amendments to align the Act with Sri Lankas human rights obligations and commitments. Speaking further, the Group reiterated their concerns surrounding the controversial Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA), continuing to call for it to be replaced with legislation that is consistent with Sri Lankas international obligations. Attached below is the full statement issued by the Core Group at the 55th Session of the UNHRC: Thank you, Mr President. This statement is on behalf of the Sri Lanka Core Group comprising Canada, Malawi, Montenegro, North Macedonia, the United Kingdom and the United States. High Commissioner, There have been several important legislative developments regarding human rights, reconciliation and civic space. Unfortunately, some of these developments give cause for concern. The Online Safety Act has the potential to severely restrict online communication, and could potentially criminalise nearly all forms of expression, creating an environment that has a chilling effect on freedom of expression. We urge the Government to enact amendments to align the Act with Sri Lankas human rights obligations and commitments. We continue to call for the Prevention of Terrorism Act to be replaced with legislation that is consistent with Sri Lankas international obligations. We acknowledge the recent release of nine Tamil leaders detained last November. We encourage the release of unjustly held long-term PTA detainees and for Sri Lanka to maintain a moratorium on its use. While we note the Governments efforts to establish a Commission on Truth, Unity and Reconciliation we stress the importance of an inclusive participatory process to build trust in advance of any legislation. Any future Commission must be independent, inclusive, meaningful, and transparent, meet the expectations of affected communities, build upon previous transitional justice processes, and provide pathways for accountability. As the Government brings forward other legislation with potentially serious implications for fundamental freedoms and civic space, we encourage comprehensive consultations with stakeholders, including civil society, and due legislative process. We welcome the Governments stated commitments on land releases but note with concern reports of increased tensions around land seizures in the North and, particularly, the East of the country. High Commissioner, we urge the Government to engage with you and your office to address these and other challenges, and we remain ready to support Sri Lanka in addressing HRC resolution 511. Thank you.",

        "date": "March 11, 2024 06:23 pm",
        "content": "Tamil National Alliance (TNA) parliamentarian M.A. Sumanthiran says the opposition can only decide on whether to support the International Monetary Fund (IMF) programme after analyzing the IMFs technical assistance reports which he says the government has now agreed to provide. He made these remarks while speaking to reports following a meeting held at the Presidential Secretariat in Colombo today (11) with the President and government officials for talks on the IMF programme. He also said that presently they are unable to support the IMF programme owing to the lack of transparency and also because most of the economic reform measures are impacting the countrys poor and vulnerable. The TNA spokesman said the President had invited the opposition party leaders for a discussion on the IMF programme and that however, he was the only member of the opposition present today. President Ranil Wickremesinghe, Prime Minister Dinesh Gunawardena, Leader of the House Susil Premajayantha, State Ministers of Finance Ranjith Siyanbalapitiya and Shehan Semasinghe, Governor of the Central Bank Dr. Nandalal Weerasinghe, Secretary to the Treasury Mahinda Siriwardana had participated in the discussion. Apparently, there will be another meeting directly with the IMF representatives, but today was only the initial discussion with the government, he said. Sumanthiran said he raised a number of concerns with regard to the IMF programme that is being implemented. Primarily the concern that I raised was that there is a lack of transparency with regard to these recommendations that the IMF has made. The lack of transparency arises in this way that there are no published technical assistance reports of the IMF. Those are the analytical basis as to why they make some of those recommendations. With regard to revenue increase, the parliamentarian said he raised as an example the question as to why the Withholding Tax rate was not increased to immediately raise revenue. But based on the fact that there is the revenue authorities are not collecting targeted taxes, the VAT rate was increased to 18 which affects all the people particularly the poor in the country and there was no adequate response to that as to why that was done, he charged. Similarly a number of other issues particularly prior action that was identified, the MP said, adding that he highlighted 15 of those that have not been done at all to date and which ought to have been completed by February 2024. He said the governments response was that in discussion with the IMF, they have received extensions of time. But most importantly the issues are with regard to these technical assistance reports that are given by the IMF to the government, he reiterated. The IMFs policy is that they can publish it only with the consent of the government and I asked the government whether they can give consent to the IMF to publish it. The President and the other ministers agreed that those reports can be given to us. Sumanthiran said that since he was the only member present today, the government agreed to give it to him and also to any opposition party leader who requests for it. It is only after receiving those technical assistance reports which hopefully will contain some analysis as to why IMF has made certain recommendations that we can then decide whether this programme can be supported or not. As it is we are unable to support the IMF programme primarily for lack of transparency and also for the reason that most of these measures are impacting on the poor and vulnerable and are letting the rich and the powerful get away scot-free, he added.",

In the early hours of January 23, a group of four assailants, who had arrived in a car, shot dead a Buddhist monk inside a temple in the Malwathuhiripitiya area of Gampaha. The 45-year-old Buddhist monk, Ven. Kalapaluwawe Dhammarathana Thero, who sustained critical injuries in the incident, had been rushed to the Gampaha Hospital. But he later succumbed to injuries while receiving treatment. Investigating officers have thus far arrested seven suspects allegedly complicit in the murder. The T-56 rifle supposedly used by the assailants and the remote switch of the car used in the shooting were recovered from the possession of the fourth suspect.",

        "date": "March 12, 2024 09:23 am",
        "content": "The gazette notification allowing the import of selected spices for re-export has been revoked. The communiqué was revoked following a request made by Agriculture Minister Mahinda Amaraweera from President Ranil Wickremesinghe at the Cabinet meeting convened on Monday (March 11). On Sunday, the Finance Ministry announced that the import of selected spices including pepper, cardamom, ginger, nutmeg, turmeric and cumin for re-exportation purposes would be permitted in Sri Lanka again. The import of these spices was thus conditionally allowed, subject to the approval of the Controller General of Import and Export and a local value addition of 35. This decision was taken after the Cabinet nod was given to issue relevant import licenses under the Import and Export Control Regulations. On January 01, 2023, the government banned importing spices to Sri Lanka, however, as per a memorandum presented by the Investment Promotion Minister on December 06, 2023, the Finance Ministry permitted the import of selected spices for re-export. But Minister Amaraweera had raised objections against the decision at Mondays Cabinet meeting, stating that the move would discourage the local farmers and result in the collapse of local spice production. The lawmaker further pointed out the negative impact the move could have on the quality of Sri Lankan spices, which currently ranks first among the best spices in the world. Taking the aforementioned into account, the President and the Cabinet ministers decided to revoke the gazette notification and reverse the decision to allow the import of spices for re-exportation purposes.",

        "title": "India conducts first test flight of domestically developed missile",
        "date": "March 12, 2024 09:57 am",
        "content": "Indias domestically developed Agni-5 missile successfully took its maiden test flight using the Multiple Independently-targetable Reentry Vehicle (MIRV) technology, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced on Monday (11 March). Hailing the scientists of the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) for the feat, he said he was proud of them for the successful completion of Mission Divyastra. Agni-5 is Indias nuclear-capable long-range surface-to-surface missile developed by DRDO. The first test flight using MIRV is significant for India as it has entered the league of a select group of countries that have this capability. What is MIRV? Multiple Independently-targetable Reentry Vehicles (MIRVs) allow a missile to deliver multiple nuclear warheads at different targets that are even hundreds of kilometres apart. While conventional missiles can carry one warhead, MIRVs are capable of deploying several warheads. As per India Today, this missile technology is important in strategic nuclear warfare as it permits a missile to target different locations at the same time. These vehicles were developed during the Cold War as part of the arms race. The technology was first deployed by the United States in an Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) in 1970. A year later, it deployed MIRV on a Submarine-Launched Ballistic Missile (SLBM), as per Washington-based non-profit advocacy group, the Centre for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation. Developing it is not an easy task as it involves a combination of large missiles, small warheads, accurate guidance, and a complex mechanism for releasing warheads sequentially during flight, the group said in its article. According to political scientist Ted Greenwoods study, Making of the MIRV: A Study of Defense Decision Making, the US believed MIRV would give enhancement of a first-strike capability to its strategic forces, enabling it to attack diverse Soviet targets. Which other countries have it? By the end of the 1970s, the erstwhile Soviet Union had developed MIRV technology for its ICBMs and SLBMs. According to the Centre for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation article, the United Kingdom, France and the US deploy MIRV on SLBMs, while China uses it on ICMBs. Russia has MIRV-equipped both ICBMs and SLBMs. The use of MIRVs on submarines is considered less destabilising than on land-based missiles because the difficulty of finding nuclear submarines makes strikes against them unlikely, the article by the nonprofit said. Now, India has joined this small group of countries that have developed the MIRV technology. According to government sources, the system is equipped with domestic Avionics systems and high-accuracy sensor packages, which ensured that the re-entry vehicles reached the target points within the desired accuracy. Last October, Pakistan successfully test-fired Ababeel, a medium-range ballistic missile. This MIRV-capable missile is reportedly a response to New Delhis efforts to develop and expand its ballistic missile defense (BMD) programme. Israel is also believed to either already have or is in the process of developing MIRV-equipped missiles, reported Indian Express. Agni-5 missile and its significance Agni-5 is the fifth variant of Indias long-range surface-to-surface ballistic missile. Before this, its last test was conducted in December 2022 off the coast of Odisha. This test had come on the heels of a clash between Indian and Chinese troops at the Line of Actual Control in Tawang, Arunachal Pradesh. The family of Agni missiles has been used by the Indian armed forces since the early 1990s. Agni-5 can carry out strikes at ranges of 5,000 to 5,500 km, bringing major Chinese cities, including the capital Beijing, within its range, noted Indian Express. It has a maximum payload of around 1,360 kilogramme and is designed to deliver nuclear warheads. Agni-5 missiles, which use a three-stage solid-fuelled engine, have advanced navigation systems including a ring laser gyroscope inertial navigation system (NavIC) and satellite guidance.

        "title": "Haitis unelected Prime Minister Ariel Henry resigns",
        "date": "March 12, 2024 11:06 am",
        "content": "Haitis Prime Minister Ariel Henry has agreed to resign, the chair of the Caribbean group of countries has said, following weeks of mounting pressure and increasing violence in the country. It comes after regional leaders met in Jamaica on Monday to discuss a political transition in Haiti. Mr Henry is currently stranded in Puerto Rico after being prevented by armed gangs from returning home. He had led the country since the former presidents assassination in July 2021. Speaking following the meeting in Kingston, Caribbean community chair and Guyana President Irfaan Ali said: We acknowledge his resignation upon the establishment of a transitional presidential council and naming of an interim prime minister. Heavily armed gangs have controlled the streets of the Haitian capital of Port-au-Prince in recent days, demanding the resignation of the unelected prime minister. Port-au-Prince and the surrounding region is under a month-long state of emergency, while a curfew has been extended. Mr Henry had been in Kenya to sign a deal on the deployment of an international security force to help tackle violence when a coalition of gangs attacked police stations and stormed two of Haitis largest prisons. A plane carrying Mr Henry was stopped from landing following sustained attacks at Haitis international airport. His resignation has been expected for several days. The Caricom group of Caribbean nations had made its position clear that he was seen as an impediment to Haitis stability and that he would have to stand down so the move to a transitional council could begin. The White House had initially wanted to see Mr Henry return to Haiti to oversee the transitional process, but the ferocity of fighting in the country changed minds in Washington in recent days. Without the support of either the US state department or his neighbours, it was clear that Mr Henry had no alternative but to stand down. Mr Henry has expressed a wish to return to Haiti but the security situation has to improve before he is able to do so, according to the US which was at the talks in Kingston on Monday. A senior US official said Mr Henry had first made the decision to step down on Friday but he had waited for an official announcement so talks could take place. US Secretary of State Blinken committed a further 100m (78m) to the 1,000-strong UN-backed security force Kenya is expected to lead in Haiti. The proposed US contribution to the security force now stands at 300m following Mr Blinkens announcement, with a further 33m allocated for humanitarian aid. President Ali said the transitional presidential council would have two observers and seven voting members, including representatives from several coalitions, the private sector and civil society, and one religious leader. The council has been mandated to swiftly appoint an interim prime minister, he said, adding that anyone intending to run in Haitis next elections will not be able to participate. It is hoped the council will pave the way for the first elections in Haiti since 2016. Mr Henry, in power since the assassination of President Jovenel Moïse, had repeatedly postponed elections, saying security must be restored first. Source - BBC --Agencies",

        "date": "March 12, 2024 11:57 am",
        "content": "Palestinians began fasting for the Muslim holy month of Ramadan on Monday with cease-fire talks at a standstill, hunger worsening across the Gaza Strip and no end in sight to the war between Israel and Hamas. Prayers were held outside amid the rubble of demolished buildings. Fairy lights and decorations were hung in packed tent camps, and a video from a U.N.-school-turned-shelter showed children dancing and spraying foam in celebration as a man sang into a loudspeaker. But there was little to celebrate after five months of war that has killed over 30,000 Palestinians and left much of Gaza in ruins. Families would ordinarily break the daily sunrise-to-sundown fast with holiday feasts, but even where food is available, there is little beyond canned goods, and the prices are too high for many. You dont see anyone with joy in their eyes, said Sabah al-Hendi, who was shopping for food Sunday in the southernmost city of Rafah. Every family is sad. Every family has a martyr. The United States, Qatar and Egypt had hoped to broker a cease-fire ahead of the normally joyous holiday that would include the release of dozens of Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners, and the entry of a large amount of humanitarian aid, but the talks have stalled. Hamas is demanding guarantees that any such agreement will lead to an end to the war. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has rejected that demand, vowing to continue the offensive until total victory against the militant group and the release of all the remaining hostages held in Gaza. Netanyahu said Monday that Israel had killed Hamas number four leader and added that more targeted killings were to come. Three, two, and one are on the way. They are all dead men. We will reach them all, he said. Netanyahu was likely referencing the assassination of Saleh Arouri, the deputy political head of Hamas and a founder of the groups military wing, who was killed in a blast in Beirut in January. Israel was widely believed to be behind the blast, although it did not take responsibility. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres urged Israel and Hamas to honor the spirit of Ramadan by silencing the guns and releasing all the hostages. The eyes of the world are watching. The eyes of history are watching. We cannot look away, he said. We must act to avoid more preventable deaths.  Desperate civilians need action  immediate action. The war began when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking around 250 hostage. Hamas is still believed to be holding around 100 captives and the remains of 30 others following an exchange last year. The war has driven around 80 of Gazas population of 2.3 million people from their homes and pushed hundreds of thousands to the brink of famine. Health officials say at least 25 people, mostly children, have died from malnutrition and dehydration in northern Gaza. Israeli forces have largely sealed off the north since October, and aid groups say Israeli restrictions, ongoing hostilities and the breakdown of law and order have made it nearly impossible to safely deliver desperately needed food in much of the territory. Israel has vowed to expand its offensive to the southern city of Rafah, where half of Gazas population has sought refuge, without saying where civilians would go to escape the onslaught. President Joe Biden has said an attack on Rafah would be a red line for him, but that the United States would continue to provide military aid to Israel. Biden acknowledged in his annual Ramadan message that the holy month comes at a moment of intense pain. As Muslims gather around the world over the coming days and weeks to break their fast, the suffering of the Palestinian people will be front of mind for many. It is front of mind for me, he said. The United States and other countries have begun airdropping aid, but humanitarian groups say such efforts are costly and insufficient. The U.S. military has also begun transporting equipment to build a sea bridge to deliver aid, but it will likely be several weeks before it is operational. A ship belonging to Spanish aid group Open Arms was expected to make a pilot voyage to Gaza from nearby Cyprus, though it was not clear when it would depart. The United States has provided crucial military support to Israel and shielded it from international calls for a cease-fire while urging it to do more to avoid harming civilians and facilitate humanitarian aid. Gazas Health Ministry said Monday that at least 31,112 Palestinians have been killed since the war began, including 67 bodies brought to hospitals in the past 24 hours. The ministry doesnt differentiate between civilians and combatants in its count, but it has said women and children make up two-thirds of the dead. Israel blames the civilian death toll on Hamas because the militants fight in dense, residential areas and position fighters, tunnels and rocket launchers near homes, schools and mosques. The military has said it has killed 13,000 Hamas fighters, without providing evidence. Speaking on Saturday to MSNBC, Biden said Israel had the right to respond to the Oct. 7 attack but that Netanyahu must pay more attention to the innocent lives being lost. He added that you cannot have 30,000 more Palestinians dead. Source: The Associated Press --Agencies",

        "content": "The Cabinet of Ministers has given its approval to publish the Draft Bill of the Recovery of Loans by Banks (Special Provisions) Act No. 4 of 1990, which was amended to facilitate legal provisions for the suspension of Parate Law. Cabinets approval comes after the Attorney General cleared the Bill drafted by the Legal Draftsman. Accordingly, the Draft Bill of the Loans by Banks (Special Provisions) Act will subsequently be tabled in Parliament for approval. At its meeting convened on February 26, the Cabinet of Ministers green-lighted a proposal made by President Ranil Wickremesinghe, in his capacity as the Finance Minister, to suspend the Parate Law until December 15, 2024. As per the Cabinets decision, the banks practice of acquiring properties of whose loans are yet to be paid off will be suspended until December 15 and Section 4 of the Recovery of Loans by Banks (Special Provisions) Act No. 4 of 1990 will be amended to facilitate the necessary legal provisions. The government earlier said it observed that large-, medium- and small-scale businesspeople in the country had to face numerous constraints to maintain their businesses during the economic hardships that prevailed over the past 3 years. Although the economy has revived to some extent now, certain issues still exist pertaining to paying off the loans obtained from the banks for the medium- and small-scale businesses. Under such circumstances, adhering to existing legal provisions, banks have been acquiring properties of a considerable number of businessmen due to non-payment of loans and subsequently auctioning them. For this reason, the government said a sufficient grace period should be granted to pay off the loans without being a burden to the banking system. In light of this, the Cabinet of Ministers in February approved the proposal tabled by the President to put a temporary halt to the acquisition of properties of loan defaulters by banks and to amend the Recovery of Loans by Banks (Special Provisions) Act.",

        "date": "March 12, 2024 01:46 pm",
        "content": "A former Boeing employee known for raising concerns about the firms production standards has been found dead in the US. John Barnett had worked for Boeing for 32 years, until his retirement in 2017. In the days before his death, he had been giving evidence in a whistleblower lawsuit against the company. Boeing said it was saddened to hear of Mr Barnetts passing. The Charleston County coroner confirmed his death to the BBC on Monday. It said the 62-year-old had died from a self-inflicted wound on 9 March and police were investigating. Mr Barnett had worked for the US plane giant for 32 years, until his retirement in 2017 on health grounds. From 2010, he worked as a quality manager at the North Charleston plant making the 787 Dreamliner, a state-of-the-art airliner used mainly on long-haul routes. In 2019, Mr Barnett told the BBC that under-pressure workers had been deliberately fitting sub-standard parts to aircraft on the production line. He also said he had uncovered serious problems with oxygen systems, which could mean one in four breathing masks would not work in an emergency. He said soon after starting work in South Carolina he had become concerned that the push to get new aircraft built meant the assembly process was rushed and safety was compromised, something the company denied. He later told the BBC that workers had failed to follow procedures intended to track components through the factory, allowing defective components to go missing. He said in some cases, sub-standard parts had even been removed from scrap bins and fitted to planes that were being built to prevent delays on the production line. He also claimed that tests on emergency oxygen systems due to be fitted to the 787 showed a failure rate of 25, meaning that one in four could fail to deploy in a real-life emergency. Mr Barnett said he had alerted managers to his concerns, but no action had been taken. Boeing denied his assertions. However, a 2017 review by the US regulator, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), did uphold some of Mr Barnetts concerns. It established that the location of at least 53 non-conforming parts in the factory was unknown, and that they were considered lost. Boeing was ordered to take remedial action. On the oxygen cylinders issue, the company said that in 2017 it had identified some oxygen bottles received from the supplier that were not deploying properly. But it denied that any of them were actually fitted on aircraft. After retiring, he embarked on a long-running legal action against the company. He accused it of denigrating his character and hampering his career because of the issues he pointed out - charges rejected by Boeing. At the time of his death, Mr Barnett had been in Charleston for legal interviews linked to that case. Last week, he gave a formal deposition in which he was questioned by Boeings lawyers, before being cross-examined by his own counsel. He had been due to undergo further questioning on Saturday. When he did not appear, enquiries were made at his hotel. He was subsequently found dead in his truck in the hotel car park. Speaking to the BBC, his lawyer described his death as tragic. In a statement Boeing said: We are saddened by Mr. Barnetts passing, and our thoughts are with his family and friends. His death comes at a time when production standards at both Boeing and its key supplier Spirit Aerosystems are under intense scrutiny. This follows an incident in early January when an unused emergency exit door blew off a brand-new Boeing 737 Max shortly after take-off from Portland International Airport. A preliminary report from the US National Transportation Safety Board suggested that four key bolts, designed to hold the door securely in place, were not fitted. Last week, the FAA said a six-week audit of the company had found multiple instances where the company allegedly failed to comply with manufacturing quality control requirements.

        "date": "March 12, 2024 02:35 pm",
        "content": "The Cabinet Sub-Committee to formulate and implement a National Education Policy Framework (NEPF), recognizing educations crucial role in contemporary economic transformation, convened on Monday (March 11) under the patronage of President Ranil Wickremesinghe at the Presidents Office. The committee comprises eight ministers, including Prime Minister Dinesh Gunawardena and Education Minister Dr. Susil Premjayantha. Within the NEPF are outlined short- and medium-term strategies aimed at transforming the education sector. During the meeting, the committee focused specifically on urgent and critical measures necessary to address immediate challenges within the current education landscape. It was decided that a Bill to establish a National Council for Teachers, aimed at fostering active teacher participation in decision-making and enhancing the professionalization of teaching services through the introduction of a teacher certification system, be presented to the Cabinet of Ministers and subsequently to Parliament within a month. This decision has been finalized and is set to move forward for approval. The goal of this council is to elevate the teaching profession to a position of high recognition. It seeks to enhance teacher professional qualities, introduce a clear professional development framework with a specific pathway for educators, and assess the teacher salary structure to align with emerging professional standards, according to the PMD. Additionally, it will fulfil requirements such as establishing a system to recognize and reward both teachers and principals for their contributions and achievements. In 2000, eight English medium subjects were introduced in schools. However, though 24 years have lapsed, these subjects are currently taught in English medium at only 765 schools. Given the significant societal demand for English medium education, it was proposed at the meeting of the Cabinet Sub-Committee on National Education Policy that the number of such schools should be increased to 1,000. This expansion aims to accommodate at least 200,000 students receiving education in English by the year 2025. President Ranil Wickremesinghe instructed the recruitment of 2,500 new teachers to expedite the implementation of this initiative. Given the urgent nature of this task, it was further advised to swiftly hire 1,000 qualified retired teachers capable of teaching subjects in English medium on a contract basis for three years. Additionally, the directive includes recruiting 1,100 graduates proficient in teaching in English medium through an open competitive examination. This will also include 400 College of Education (Vidyapeeta) teachers who are set to graduate from Colleges of Education that currently provide training for teachers in English medium. In addition to the school leaving certificate currently given to students who complete junior secondary education as well as senior secondary education, the students are not entitled to any quality certificate that shows the various skills and recognized subjects that a student has shown in school over the years. Accordingly, a policy decision was reached to provide a Certificate of Completion to every student, not limited to the certificates showing the results of the national examinations, effective from this year. -- PMD",

        "date": "March 12, 2024 04:41 pm",
        "content": "India has announced rules that would allow it to implement a controversial citizenship bill that excludes Muslims. The Indian Ministry of Home Affairs announced the rules Monday, ahead of Indias general election in the spring, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi will seek a rare third term in power. The Citizenship (Amendment) Act provides a fast-track to citizenship for immigrants from Afghanistan, Bangladesh, and Pakistan  provided they are not Muslim. The controversial law would apply to religious minorities persecuted on religious grounds, including Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, Parsis and Christians. The bill, originally passed by Indias parliament in 2019, could not come into effect until the rules were notified. Despite being well-received by Modi, a Hindu nationalist, the bill was heavily protested by opposition parties, which claimed it was unconstitutional and marginalized Indias 200-million Muslim population. Indian Home Minister Amit Shah praised Modi on Monday evening, saying he delivered on another commitment and realized the promise of the makers of our constitution to the Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, Parsis and Christians living in those countries in a post on X. Critics of the bill say it is another example of how Modi and Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) have pushed an agenda of Hindu nationalism onto secular India, a country of 1.3 billion people, at the expense of the Muslim population. The BJP has its roots in Indias Hindu right-wing movement, many followers of which see India as a Hindu nation. Since Modis rise to power nearly a decade ago, critics say the once secular and democratic founding ethos of the worlds largest democracy is crumbling at an alarming speed, with minorities feeling persecuted under the BJPs majoritarian policies and any criticism of the government facing censorship and punishment. It comes a month after two mosques were demolished in Uttarakhand state and Delhi, within days of each other, leading to clashes and local curfews. In January, Modi inaugurated a vast Hindu temple on the site of a 16th-century mosque that was destroyed by Hindu hardliners more than 30 years ago. While many Hindus celebrated the opening of the Ram Janmabhoomi Mandir in Ayodhya, the inauguration was a painful reminder to the countrys minority Muslim population of the religious divisions that have grown more pronounced under Modis rule.

As many as 500 local and foreign students are expected to be annually enrolled for MBBS degrees offered by the NSBM, fully self-financed institution owned by the government. For this purpose, NSBM has sought the governments approval to reserve Homagama Base Hospital as a suitable government hospital to provide clinical training for its medical students. Since the approval of the Cabinet of Ministers has already been given to use the Homagama Base Hospital for clinical training of Sri Jayewardenepura Universitys medical students, it has been proposed to prepare a mechanism to reserve the hospital, on the basis of resource sharing, for the clinical training of NSBM medical faculty students as well as professor unit facilities. The NSBM has agreed to provide necessary funds for the development of Homagama Base Hospital pursuant to the standards of medical education published by the SLMC. As such, the Cabinet of Ministers on Monday (March 11) green-lighted the proposal presented by President Ranil Wickremesinghe to take over the Homagama Basic Hospital under the purview of the Health Ministry and upgrade it as a teaching hospital.",

The marathon, held as part of the inter-house sports meet, took place on Monday morning (11) at the school premises. The student, identified as Vidurshan, had reportedly collapsed during the event and was rushed to Tirukkovil Hospital for treatment, following which he was taken to the Akkaraipattu Hospital for further treatment, where he was later pronounced dead. Further investigations into Vidurshans untimely death are being carried out by a group of officers attached to the Thirukkovil Police, while the Ministry of Education announced that it would also carry out an internal investigation into the incident. Meanwhile, a statement from the Ministry issued on 26 February 2024 announced that directives were communicated to all provincial directors of education, instructing them to disseminate the guidelines among school principals. The guidelines, aimed at addressing the challenges posed by the elevated temperatures, encompass a range of measures to safeguard the well-being of students and protect them from complications such as heat cramps, heat strokes, and heat exhaustion. Specific details include recommendations for hydration, appropriate clothing, and modifications to outdoor activities to mitigate the impact of the heat.

        "date": "March 12, 2024 08:14 pm",
        "content": "Ottawa police admit they made mistakes last week when communicating key information about the citys worst mass killing in recent history. Six people, including a mother, her four young children and a family acquaintance, were found dead inside a townhouse in the south Ottawa suburb of Barrhaven on March 6. The womans husband and father of the children remains in hospital. A 19-year-old man who was living with the family is in custody facing six counts of first-degree murder and one count of attempted murder. According to police, they began receiving calls at 10:52 p.m. Wednesday and responded minutes later. In court, prosecutors said the accused was in custody around 11 p.m. The day after the tragedy, the Ottawa Police Service (OPS) called the killings a mass shooting when no guns were involved, repeatedly misspelled the victims names and misidentified the accused. Chief referred to mass shooting On Thursday morning during a live, nationally broadcast interview on CBC, OPS Chief Eric Stubbs mistakenly called the killings a mass shooting. During a news conference that afternoon, Stubbs misidentified the man in custody as Frank DSouza. Later that day Febrio De-Zoysa, a 19-year-old Sri Lankan national who had come to Canada as a student, was officially charged. After the news conference on Thursday, OPS issued five separate emails to correct the victims names theyd provided earlier that day. Their first attempt contained errors in three of the six names. The second email contained different errors in the same three names. A third email corrected two names and the age of a victim. After CBC flagged more errors, OPS replied with yet another correction. Then, at 3 p.m., they issued a final version. Quickly evolving investigation In a statement to CBC, OPS admitted the mistakes and said homicides are very complex files to investigate and quickly evolving. In the case of the Barrhaven killings, police said there were multiple credible sources consulted in the collating of names, and some information we received was wrong, OPS said. We also made mistakes when we communicated key information about the tragic deaths. That is an inherent risk of the fast paced and timely communications we strive to deliver to Ottawa residents. The statement said responding officers and investigators diligently collect information in a process involving contacting multiple sources, including involved persons (victimssuspects), witnesses, family members and of course official governmentdatabases. Erroneous information is sometimes communicated to police and we can also make mistakes when communicating with the community and media, OPS said. When that happens, we correct it as soon as possible. Police communications incredibly problematic Christopher Schneider, a professor of criminology at Brandon University in Manitoba, said communications by Ottawa police were incredibly problematic in this case. Often ones competence is judged by their communicative performance, Schneider said. If the police are not communicating effectively through traditional media, social media, with the community, that leads to the public perception of police incompetence. That in turn could possibly extend to an erosion of confidence and trust in policing, he said. Schneider said ineffective communication from police is magnified when it involves immigrant, refugee and racialized communities, including Indigenous ones. These community groups, they talk among themselves and they see this when it comes out in media, they see that the police are not effectively communicating in a tragic, outrageous circumstance like this, he said. This leads to a continuing rotation and distrust in police and policing. Police facing tremendous pressure Darryl Davies, a professor of criminology at Carleton University, said Ottawa police and other first responders would have faced tremendous pressure as they arrived at the crime scene. That probably contributed to the lack of information and consistency of information that subsequently came out, Davies said, noting their priority would be locating victims and hunting for the suspect. They were probably, understandably, totally caught off guard, and the shock and the horror of witnessing something like that would have unbelievable ramifications on the individuals who are there. Davies said that trauma probably more than anything overshadowed any consistency or communication to the public, because it would have just been so horrific. He said even officers prepared with the best possible training would face a horrific challenge just trying to process the information. The Ottawa police did the best they could under the circumstances, given the horrific nature of the events and how they unfolded. But Davies also said police need better training in communicating the details of such tragedies to the public. Police as a whole need to have people who are specialized in communications. I think they should be trained in how to deal with these situations, he said. Source: CBC -Agencies",

        "date": "March 13, 2024 09:49 am",
        "content": "The District Collector of Tiruchirappalli (Tiruchi), India on Tuesday informed the Madras High Court of having fixed an appointment with the Sri Lankan Deputy High Commission in Chennai for former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi assassination case convicts Murugan alias Sriharan, Robert Payas and Jayakumar. Appearing before a Division Bench of Justices R. Suresh Kumar and K. Kumaresh Babu, Additional Public Prosecutor R. Muniyapparaj said all the three released convicts hailed from Sri Lanka and therefore they required travel documents from the Deputy High Commission. Since they were now detained at a foreigners detention camp in Tiruchi, the Collector had written to the Deputy High Commission on Monday, March 11, requesting an appointment for all three of them, and had received a reply on the same day to produce them on Wednesday afternoon. Therefore, necessary escort arrangements had been made to transport them from the camp at around 5 a.m. on Wednesday so that they could be produced before the Deputy High Commission at 12:30 p.m., the APP said, and urged the court to dispose of a writ petition connected with the issue. One more released convict and wife of Murugan, S. Nalini, had filed the writ petition, through her counsel S. Doraisamy and V. Elangovan, seeking a direction to the Collector to permit her husband to visit the Deputy High Commission to get an all-country passport so that they both could travel to the U.K. The writ petitioner, an Indian national, told the court that she was pregnant when she was arrested in connection with the 1991 assassination and delivered a baby girl at the prison. Her daughter was subsequently taken to Sri Lanka by her paternal grandparents and was now living in the U.K. Though the Supreme Court had, in 2022, ordered the premature release of all seven convicts in the assassination case, her husband and three other Sri Lankan nationals were not let free and instead transferred from the prison to the foreigners detention camp for want of necessary travel documents. Now that she and her husband had decided to fly to the U.K. to reside with their daughter, the petitioner sought permission for him to be produced before the Deputy High Commission to obtain an all-country passport. Though the relief sought was confined to Sriharan alias Murugan, the APP told the court that the Collector had gone ahead and fixed an appointment for Robert Payas and Jayakumar too, since they too were Sri Lankan nationals and required travel documents to fly back to their country. The judges recorded the submission and disposed of Nalinis writ petition. Another Sri Lankan national Santhan alias T. Suthenthirarajah was the first to obtain a travel document to fly to Sri Lanka. However, he died in Chennai due to certain ailments and only his mortal remains could be flown to the island nation recently. Source: The Hindu -Agencies",

        "date": "March 13, 2024 10:03 am",
        "content": "US President Joe Biden and his predecessor Donald Trump have both passed the delegate thresholds to clinch their parties nominations for the election in November. Four states, one American territory and Democrats living abroad held their primaries on Tuesday. The result means US voters face a rematch of the 2020 presidential election in eight months time. The nominations will be made official at party conventions this summer. The 81-year-old president said on Tuesday evening that he was honoured voters had backed his re-election bid in a moment when the threat Trump poses is greater than ever. Citing positive economic trends, he asserted the US was in the middle of a comeback but faced challenges to its future as a democracy, as well as from those seeking to pass abortion restrictions and cut social programmes. I believe that the American people will choose to keep us moving into the future, Mr Biden said in a statement from his campaign. Incumbency gave Mr Biden a natural advantage and he faced no serious challengers for the Democratic nomination. Despite persistent concerns from voters that his age limits his ability to perform the duties of the presidency, the party apparatus rallied around him. Meanwhile, Mr Trump, 77, remains very popular with the Republican voter base, which has propelled him to victory in primary after primary over well-funded rivals. His campaign for a second term in the White House has zeroed in on stricter immigrations laws, including a pledge to seal the border and implement record-setting deportations. Mr Trump has also vowed to fight crime, boost domestic energy production, tax foreign imports, end the war in Ukraine and resume an America first approach to global affairs. Tuesday nights results do not come as a shock, as both men have dominated their races so far. Both their re-nominations seemed all but predetermined, despite polling that indicates Americans are dissatisfied with the prospect of another showdown between Mr Biden and Mr Trump in November. The US presidential primaries and caucuses are a state-by-state competition to secure the most party delegates. The Democrats and the Republicans have slightly different rules for their primaries, but the process is essentially the same. Each state is allocated a certain share of party delegates, which are awarded either as a whole to the winning candidate or proportionally, based on the results. A Republican candidate must secure at least 1,215 of their partys delegates during the primary season to win their presidential nomination, while a Democrat must secure 1,968. On Tuesday, Republicans held primaries in Mississippi, Georgia and Washington State, and a caucus in Hawaii. Democrats, meanwhile, held primaries in the states of Georgia, Washington and Mississippi, as well as in the Northern Mariana Islands and for Democrats living abroad. Mr Biden and Mr Trumps main competitors had dropped out before Tuesdays primary contests, so the results had been all but certain. Former UN Ambassador Nikki Haley, Mr Trumps last remaining rival, dropped out earlier this month after losing 14 states to Mr Trump on Super Tuesday. Though several more states have yet to hold their primary contests, with Mr Trump and Mr Biden over the delegate threshold, the 2024 general election is now effectively under way. The US presidential election will be held on 5 November 2024. Source: BBC -Agencies",

        "date": "March 13, 2024 10:26 am",
        "content": "The Supreme Court has once again taken up for hearing the petition filed by State Minister Diana Gamage challenging a decision taken by the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) to scrap her membership in the party. The petition was reheard before a three-member Supreme Court trial bench comprising of Justices Gamini Amarasekara, Kumuduni Wickremesinghe and Mahinda Samayawardena, Ada Derana reporter said. Appearing for the General Secretary of the SJB Ranjith Madduma Bandara, who has been named as a respondent of the case, Presidents Counsel Jayampathy Wickramaratne pointed out before the courts that several essential parties have not been named as respondents in this petition. He also mentioned that the petition could not be maintained further on the grounds that the members of the SJBs executive board and the members of the disciplinary committee, who are essential parties relating to the matter, have not been named as respondents in the petition, which he deemed a serious legal error. The Presidents Counsel further expressed that the petitioner Diana Gamages decision to support the ruling party without seeking approval from the SJB beforehand is completely against the partys constitution and that it was clear that she has violated party disciplines. Thus, Presidents Counsel Wickramaratne who stated that the decision taken to expel Gamage from SJB is completely lawful, requested the court to dismiss the petition filed by the State Minister. The SJB had earlier decided to expel National List MP Gamage from the party citing that she had failed to comply with the unanimous decision taken by the party to vote against the 20th Amendment to the Constitution, by voting in favour. The SJB had also highlighted that this was a serious violation of party discipline, and that the Opposition Leader and the SJBs leader Sajith Premadasa decided to suspend her party membership for the reputation or well-being and prosperity of the party.",

        "date": "March 13, 2024 10:34 am",
        "content": "Pakistans newly-elected President Asif Ali Zardari on Tuesday announced that he would not draw any salary during his tenure as part of his bid to help the cash-strapped country face the challenging economic hardship. Zardari, 68, who took oath as Pakistans 14th President on Sunday, decided to encourage prudent financial management and not burden the national exchequer, his Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) said in a statement on X. The President considered it essential not to burden the national exchequer and preferred to forgo his salary, President Secretariat Press Wing said in a press release on Tuesday. Former president Arif Alvi was drawing Rs 8,46,550 per month, which was fixed by Parliament in 2018. Zardari is one of the richest politicians in Pakistan. Zardari, co-chairman of the PPP, took oath as President of Pakistan for a second term at a ceremony at Aiwan-i-Sadr in Islamabad on Sunday. Separately, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi, following the steps of Zardari, also decided to forego his salary while in office citing the economic challenges faced by the country. Taking to X, Naqvi said that he committed to serving the nation in challenging times in every possible way. Naqvi said that he has decided to forego his salary during the tenure. In these challenging times, committed to supporting and serving our nation in every possible way, he said in an X post. Debt-struck Pakistan has been reeling under economic pressure with the price of commodities touching sky-high prices. The newly elected government needs a new loan from the International Monetary Fund on an urgent basis, and its politicians, who are often super-rich, use such tactics to win support from the impoverished masses. In February last year, the Cabinet of then-prime minister Shehbaz Sharif gave up their salary and other perks to help the country tackle its possible default on external liabilities. Addressing the maiden cabinet meeting after inducting 19 members on Monday, Prime Minister Sharif said that the first test of the cash-strapped countrys newly-elected government is to rein in inflation and prices of food items. Sharif, who was elected for a second term on Sunday, said that bringing inflation under control is the biggest challenge, however, the government together with the provincial administrations would consider ways how to manage the prices of the essentials. This is our first test, he said. Sharif said Pakistan is facing massive challenges and a deep surgery is required to pull the cash-strapped country out of the economic crisis. Taking stock of the issues and problems affecting the economy and the country, the prime minister asked his Cabinet members to perform or perish, saying that the time is now or never. Sharif said the government should make difficult decisions without wasting any time. Deep surgery is needed as antibiotics will not work, he said. He directed the immediate formation of a committee to control the prices of essential food items. He emphasised that strict action would be taken against unjustified price increases and profiteering in essential commodities. In response to a recommendation by the Ministry of Commerce, the Cabinet also approved a restriction on the export of onions and bananas until the 15th of next month. Source: PTI --Agencies",

        "date": "March 13, 2024 11:41 am",
        "content": "The prime suspect in the murder of a 17-year-old girl from Elpitiya was arrested on Tuesday night (March 12), the police said. The arrestee was identified as the deceaseds brother-in-law, named Sudesh Priyankara. During interrogations, he has confessed to killing his wifes younger sister over her alleged romantic involvement with another man. The suspect has been remanded until March 21 after being produced before the Elpitiya Magistrates Court. About a month-and-a-half ago, Hansika Nadeeshani, originally from Thalgahawatta area of Mandakanda in Karandeniya, had stayed with her sister for a while to help take care of her two kids. During her stay, she was purportedly romantically involved with her brother-in-law, according to police reports. According to Nadeeshanis father, she had been forcibly taken away by her brother-in-law on two occasions, however, the parents had managed to bring her back home both times. Against this backdrop, the girls family filed a complaint with the police last Wednesday (March 6). Upon receiving summons from the police to hear the complaint, Nadeeshani, along with her mother and another sister, had been on her way to the Elpitiya police station on Friday morning (March 8) when her brother-in-law once again forcibly took her away by blocking the three-wheeler the trio was travelling in. Subsequently, Nadeeshanis mother lodged another complaint with the Elpitiya police, but the girls body was later located at a tea estate in Thalgahawatta on Saturday (March 9). She was found to have died of a cut-throat injury. The police then launched a manhunt for the brother-in-law who was on the run. Meanwhile, the driver of the three-wheeler which Priyankara had arrived in was later arrested after he surrendered to the Karandeniya Police. The arrestee had told the investigators that he was merely a three-wheeler driver hired by the suspect for the ride, and admitted to dropping them off at Nanayakkara Mawatha, located adjacent to the said tea estate where the body was discovered.",

        "title": "Toyota and Nippon Steel agree to historic pay hikes",
        "date": "March 13, 2024 12:04 pm",
        "content": "Japans largest employers announced record pay increases on Wednesday, signaling a break from the deflationary mindset that led to the countrys prolonged period of low economic growth known as the lost decades. Every spring, unions and management hold talks, known as shunto, to set monthly wages ahead of the start of Japans fiscal year in April. Toyota Motor, Hitachi and Panasonic Holdings were among the companies that on Wednesday fully met labor unions demands to raise wages. Nippon Steel said it will raise monthly wages by a record 35,000 yen (237), or 14, surpassing its previous record of 23,000 yen in 1979. The steelmaker, which in December agreed to buy American peer U.S. steel for 2 trillion yen, said, It is essential to secure promising talent and make all employees more productive. Toyota did not disclose details of its wage increases but said it fully met union demands. The Toyota Motor Workers Union has demanded bonus payments worth 7.6 months of salary, citing the companys all-time high annual operating profit forecast of 4.5 trillion yen for the current fiscal year. The union has also proposed specific demands for each job category, up to a 28,440 yen monthly wage increase. Hitachi and Toshiba said their pay hikes are the largest since the current negotiation style was introduced in 1998. Only about 16 of workers in Japan are union members, but economists have been closely following this years negotiations as a key indicator of monetary policy changes. Core inflation has been 2 or higher for nearly two years, but Bank of Japan Gov. Kazuo Ueda has stressed that a virtuous cycle of wage and price increases is necessary to achieve its price stability target, which will give the central bank the confidence to start raising interest rates. The BOJ will hold this months policy meeting on Monday and Tuesday. Economists are divided on whether there will be a change in monetary policy, but most agree an alteration will come no later than next months meeting. Due to low inflation, or deflation, for the past three decades, many Japanese companies have previously only offered seniority-based pay increases, which are tied to the number of years an employee has worked at the company. The current wave of wage hikes is much stronger because management is also offering so-called base-ups in which pay increases regardless of seniority status. Driving the raises is an acute labor shortage and persistent inflation. A weak yen boosting profits of export-oriented companies has also made it easier for major employers to commit to large pay hikes. Some companies have reached agreements quickly, which indicates that they were already planning to raise wages, said Hisashi Yamada, a professor of human resource management at Hosei Business School of Innovation Management. After all, the labor shortage is so severe that it will be difficult to attract workers without wage hikes. In this years negotiation, labor unions are demanding a 5.85 wage hike on average, the largest since 1993, according to the Japanese Trade Union Confederation, or Rengo, the countrys largest labor confederation. Rengo will announce the first tally of negotiation results on Friday. The figure is much higher than what economists had expected, prompting the yen to rally against the U.S. dollar in recent days amid speculation that the BOJ will end its negative interest rate policy this month. According to a February survey by the Japan Center for Economic Research, the average forecast of a panel of economists was that shunto would result in a wage hike of 3.88. Last year, major companies agreed to wage increases of 3.58, the largest hike in 30 years, according to Rengo. But pay hikes have failed to keep up with the rise in prices. Inflation-adjusted real wages declined for 22 straight months until January, suppressing consumer appetite. Household spending in January fell 6.3 from a year earlier, its biggest drop in nearly three years. The weak private consumption has been a drag on economic growth. Views are divided on whether wage hikes will translate into stronger consumption and whether the trend will continue. Spring wage increases at major companies hit double digits in the 1960s and 1970s but have hovered around 1 to 2 since the early 2000s, according to government statistics. Takeshi Niinami, CEO of beverage maker Suntory Holdings and Chairman of the Japan Association of Corporate Executives, on Tuesday said he expects big companies to raise wages by more than 5 this year, which he said would help real wage growth turn positive around May or June. With bonuses coming out in July, there will be more positive news on consumption heading into the summer, Niinami said. But Toshihiro Nagahama, chief economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute, said the growth in basic salaries will be partly offset by company efforts to reduce overtime. There will be additional restrictions on working hours for certain jobs such as truck drivers, he noted, referring to a new law limiting overtime hours that takes effect in April. I am skeptical that nominal wages will be able to surpass inflation in the short term. Marcel Thieliant, senior Japan economist at Capital Economics, expects this year to mark peak wage growth. This years inflation will almost certainly be lower than last year, he said, so it will be difficult for Rengo to justify another round of pay hikes as large as this year in the next shunto. The outcome of union-led negotiations only reflects the sentiment of large business enterprises, and the focus will be on whether wage increases will spread to small and midsize enterprises, which are struggling with rising prices and staffing difficulties. A government survey of these companies last year showed that they were only able to pass on 46 of their cost increases to customers. Source: Nikkei Asia --Agencies",

        "title": "Elderly Sri Lankan couple found dead near their Melbourne home",
        "date": "March 13, 2024 12:28 pm",
        "content": "An elderly Sri Lankan couple who died together outside their home may have been overcome by Melbournes blistering heatwave, Australian media reported. The bodies of Doyne Caspersz and his wife Marlene were found outside their home on Antigoni Court, Warrandyte about 9.30am on Tuesday. Daily Mail Australia has been told CCTV captured their sad demise on Sunday, when temperatures soared in Warrandyte to 38C. It remains unknown why the beloved couple decided to leave their home, which is located in a wealthy Melbourne neighbourhood. Melbourne had been within the grips of a shocking heatwave, which saw temperatures climb to 36C on Monday as the couple remained undiscovered outside their property. A detective at the scene on Tuesday told Daily Mail Australia the couples death had been nothing more than a tragic accident. It was misadventure, the policeman said. Shocked residents described the pair, both aged in their eighties, as friendly people who kept to themselves but would wave to neighbours when passing by in the street. They believed Mrs Caspersz had struggled with Alzheimers disease and was cared for by both her husband and her children. On Tuesday, the couples devastated son, who Daily Mail Australia has chosen not to name, said his parents had parked their car on a steep embankment on the driveway instead of directly outside the front door, and had fallen on the short walk to the front door. He hit out at suggestions his parents had died of misadventure, describing what happened as a tragic accident. News teams from across Melbourne converged on the street on Tuesday amid a wave of unrelated violence across the city. There is no murder. The police have gone through the footage. For some reason... they went down the stairs, the couples son said. It is understood on the rare occasion the couple did venture out in the car they would park either in the garage or directly beside the homes front door. From what weve been told from the police this happened on Sunday, the son said. Police on Wednesday confirmed the couples the deaths were not being treated as suspicious. Police will prepare a report for the coroner after the bodies of a woman and man were located in Warrandyte on 12 March, a police spokesperson said via a statement. Police are awaiting the results of a postmortem. Neighbour Don Savoria described Mr Caspersz as an avid gardener and someone who was always willing to help. Mr Caspersz was also heavily involved in Melbournes Sri Lankan community and was the vice president of the Burgher Association, a club that represents the Sri Lankan ethnic group in Australia. If he couldnt start his ride-on mower, Id go over and help him out, thats what neighbours do, Mr Savoria said. To me, your neighbours are better than friends or relatives, because theyre there. In an instant you need something, theyre here right away. I know that his son didnt want him to do any gardening because of his age, but mainly because he wanted (Mr Caspersz) to look after his mum (Marlene) because she wasnt well.

        "title": "HRW urges IMF to oppose repression of civic space in Sri Lanka",
        "date": "March 13, 2024 12:42 pm",
        "content": "The International Monetary Fund (IMF) should urge Sri Lankas government to abandon draft legislation that would severely curtail civil society and jeopardize the IMFs program in the country, Human Rights Watch (HRW) has said in a letter to the global lender that was released today (March 13). Issuing a statement in this regard, the HRW  an international non-governmental organization that conducts research and advocacy on human right  highlighted that the proposed Non-Governmental Organizations (Registration and Supervision) Act in Sri Lanka is among several recent and planned measures that would curtail fundamental freedoms, despite the critical role of public scrutiny in promoting good governance and combatting corruption. The IMFs US3 billion bailout of Sri Lanka  which is linked to government commitments to reform  helped stem the immediate economic crisis after the country defaulted on its foreign debt in 2022, but further progress is threatened by the adoption of laws by President Ranil Wickremesinghes administration that would severely restrict basic rights, it mentioned. The statement also points out that the Online Safety Act, enacted in January, creates vague and broad speech-related offenses punishable with lengthy prison terms. Further, the Anti-Terrorism Bill, currently before parliament, contains sweeping new speech-related offenses and arbitrary powers of arrest, and the draft law to regulate nongovernmental organizations could make independent civil society activity all but impossible in Sri Lanka, it said. As the economy collapsed in 2022, Sri Lankans demanded good governance and an end to corruption, but instead now face draconian laws and policies that threaten human rights and undermine reforms, said Meenakshi Ganguly, deputy Asia director at Human Rights Watch. The protests helped bring President Wickremesinghe to power, but instead of listening to calls for change, hes clamping down on peaceful dissent. The HRW citing a 2023 IMF study of Sri Lanka known as the Governance Diagnostic Assessment, stated that anticorruption efforts are unlikely to achieve their objectives unless they also encompass initiatives designed and led by groups outside of government who are committed to rule-based inclusive economic and social progress. However, the study found that civil societys participation in oversight and monitoring of government actions has been restricted by limited transparency, the lack of platforms for inclusive and participatory governance, and by broad application of counter-terrorism rules. As a result, opportunities for public participation and oversight of official behaviour, including by civil society, are increasingly restricted, according to HRW. Additionally, it expressed that the government on, January 30, 2024, provided the draft NGO law to selected members of civil society, who were given three weeks to respond. The bill does not address any evident need, but instead seeks to subject civil society organizations to invasive government scrutiny and interference, and threatens civil society members with prison if they dont comply with cumbersome administrative procedures. The HRW also recalled that the National Collective of CSOs and NGOs, a coalition of Sri Lankan civil society organizations, has written to the government on February 28 raising concerns that the proposed law would violate the fundamental rights to freedom of association and expression, while damaging the delivery of services by civil society organizations, including to the many families who are struggling to make ends meet in the midst of severe economic hardship. Drawing reference to the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Volker Türks March 1 update to the UN Human Rights Council on the crisis in Sri Lanka, the HRW highlighted that he was concerned by the introduction of new or proposed laws with potentially far-reaching impact on fundamental rights and freedoms  which variously strengthen the executive, grant broad powers to the security forces, and severely restrict rights to freedom of assembly, association and expression, impacting not only on civic space but the business environment. The IMF should protect the credibility and efficacy of its program in Sri Lanka by publicly calling upon the government to abandon the proposed NGO law, impose a moratorium on use of the Online Safety Act, and amend the Anti-Terrorism Bill to ensure that it respects human rights standards, HRW noted. The IMF and other international partners supporting Sri Lankas economic recovery recognize that this crisis has its roots in misgovernance and corruption, Ganguly said. If their efforts are to be successful, they need to stand firm against the governments attempts to curtail fundamental civil and political rights.",

        "title": "Princess of Wales apologizes for altering family photo that fueled rumors about her health",
        "date": "March 13, 2024 12:54 pm",
        "content": "Kate, Princess of Wales, apologized Monday for confusion caused by her altering of a family photo released by the palace  an image of Kate and her children that was intended to calm concern and speculation about the British royals health, but had the opposite effect. Several news agencies that initially published the photo, including The Associated Press, withdrew the image over concerns about digital manipulation. Issued by the couples Kensington Palace office on Sunday to mark Mothers Day in Britain, it was the first official photo of 42-year-old Kate since she had abdominal surgery nearly two months ago. The retractions sent the online rumor mill, already rampant with speculation over Kates operation and recuperation, into overdrive. The PR disaster is more evidence that the royal familys long-held mantra  never complain, never explain  is impossible in a social media-saturated era. In a post on social media, Kate said that like many amateur photographers, I do occasionally experiment with editing. I wanted to express my apologies for any confusion the family photograph we shared yesterday caused, the post said. In the past, the palace has issued several of Kates family snapshots featuring her and heir to the throne, Prince William, with their children Prince George, 10, Princess Charlotte, 8, and Prince Louis, 5. The latest photo was taken by William, Kensington Palace said. In an accompanying social media message, Kate said: Thank you for your kind wishes and continued support over the last two months. Wishing everyone a Happy Mothers Day. While there was no suggestion the photo was fake, AP retracted it because closer inspection revealed the source had manipulated the image in a way that did not meet APs photo standards. For instance, it contained an inconsistency in the alignment of Princess Charlottes left hand with the sleeve of her sweater. Other major news agencies, including Getty, Reuters, AFP and the U.K. national agency, PA, also withdrew the photo. Kensington Palace said it would not release the original unedited photograph. And while Kates statement provided a measure of clarification, it looked unlikely to stop the swirl of rumor that has accelerated during her absence from public duties. Former BBC royal correspondent Peter Hunt said the mishandled photo release is damaging for the royals. They knew there would be intense interest in any picture they released of Kate, he wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter. Their challenge is that people will now question whether they can be trusted and believed when they next issue a health update. The royal family is under particular scrutiny because King Charles III has also had to cancel public duties while he undergoes treatment for an unspecified form of cancer. The monarch has canceled all his public engagements, though he has been photographed walking to church and meeting privately with government officials and dignitaries. Charles relative openness about his diagnosis was a departure for the generally secretive royal family. But it has been eclipsed in popular interest by curiosity over Kates condition. In the absence of firm information, conspiracy theories have rushed to fill the vacuum. The release of the photo followed weeks of gossip on social media about what had happened to Kate since she left a hospital Jan. 29 after a nearly two-week stay following planned surgery. She hadnt been seen publicly since Christmas Day. Kate underwent surgery Jan. 16 and her condition and the reason for the operation have not been revealed, though Kensington Palace said it was not cancer-related. Although the palace initially said that it would only provide significant updates and that she would not return to royal duties before Easter  March 31 this year  it followed up with a statement last month saying she was doing well. At the time, royal aides told The Sun newspaper: Weve seen the madness of social media and that is not going to change our strategy. There has been much on social media but the princess has a right to privacy and asks the public to respect that. Further questions were raised last week when the British military seemed to jump the gun in announcing Kate would attend a Trooping the Color ceremony in June, apparently without consulting palace officials. Its up to palace officials, not government departments, to announce the royals attendance at events. Kensington Palace didnt confirm any scheduled public events for Kate, and the army later removed reference to her attendance. William, Queen Camilla and other senior royals attended a Commonwealth Day service at Westminster Abbey on Monday. Neither Kate nor the king was due to be at the event, which drew a crowd of several dozen anti-monarchist protesters holding signs reading Down with the Crown. William was also due to speak at an event for the Earthshot Prize, an environmental competition that he founded. Veteran public relations consultant Mark Borkowski said the photo gaffe exposed a wider PR problem for the monarchy. There doesnt seem to be that much joined-up strategic thinking at the heart of the royal family at the moment, which leads to these problems where its a very difficult organization to manage in terms of PR, he said. I find they have risen to the challenge, provided the statement as an explanation, he said of Kates apology Monday. The question is, with all the conspiracy theories running around, is whether people believe it. And Im not sure that they will. Source: The Associated Press --Agencies",

        "title": "Putin warns the West, says Russia is ready for nuclear war",
        "date": "March 13, 2024 01:59 pm",
        "content": "President Vladimir Putin warned the West on Wednesday Russia was technically ready for nuclear war and that if the U.S. sent troops to Ukraine, it would be considered a significant escalation of the conflict. Putin, speaking just days before a March 15-17 election which is certain to give him another six years in power, said the nuclear war scenario was not rushing up and he saw no need for the use of nuclear weapons in Ukraine. From a military-technical point of view, we are, of course, ready, Putin, 71, told Rossiya-1 television and news agency RIA in response to a question whether the country was really ready for a nuclear war. Putin said the U.S. understood that if it deployed American troops on Russian territory - or to Ukraine - Russia would treat the move as an intervention. (In the U.S.) there are enough specialists in the field of Russian-American relations and in the field of strategic restraint, said Putin, the ultimate decision maker in the worlds biggest nuclear power. Therefore, I dont think that here everything is rushing to it (nuclear confrontation), but we are ready for this. Putins nuclear warning came alongside another offer for talks on Ukraine as part of a new post-Cold War demarcation of European security. The U.S. says Putin is not ready for serious talks over Ukraine. The war in Ukraine has triggered the deepest crisis in Russias relations with the West since the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis and Putin has warned several times the West risks provoking a nuclear war if it sends troops to fight in Ukraine. Putin sent tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine in February 2022, triggering full-scale war after eight years of conflict in eastern Ukraine between Ukrainian forces on one side and pro-Russian Ukrainians and Russian proxies on the other. NUCLEAR WAR? In a U.S. election year, the West is grappling with how to support Kyiv against Russia, which now controls almost one-fifth of Ukrainian territory and is rearming much faster than the West and Ukraine. Kyiv says it is defending itself against an imperial-style war of conquest designed to erase its national identity. Russia says the areas it controls in Ukraine are now Russia. Putin has sent a series of public nuclear warnings to the U.S. aimed at discouraging greater involvement in Ukraine - a move the Kremlin says would mark a slide into world war. Washington says it has seen no major changes to Russias nuclear posture but Putins public nuclear warnings - which break with the extreme caution of the Soviet leadership over such remarks - have sown concern in Washington. Putin reiterated the use of nuclear weapons was spelled out in the Kremlins nuclear doctrine, which sets out the conditions under which it would use such a weapon: broadly a response to an attack using nuclear or other weapons of mass destruction, or the use of conventional weapons against Russia when the very existence of the state is put under threat. Weapons exist in order to use them, Putin said. We have our own principles. CNN reported on Saturday the administration of U.S. President Joe Biden was specifically concerned in 2022 that Russia might use a tactical or battlefield nuclear weapon in Ukraine. Putin said he had never felt the need to use nuclear weapons in Ukraine. TALKS? Putin said Russia was ready for serious talks on Ukraine. Russia is ready for negotiations on Ukraine, but they should be based on reality - and not on cravings after the use of psychotropic drugs, Putin said. Reuters reported last month that Putins suggestion of a ceasefire in Ukraine to freeze the war was rejected by the U.S. after contacts between intermediaries. U.S. Central Intelligence Agency Director William Burns warned earlier this week that if the West did not provide proper support for Ukraine, Kyiv would lose more territory to Russia which would embolden Chinese President Xi Jinping. Burns, a former U.S. ambassador to Russia, told the Senate Intelligence Committee it was in U.S. interests to support Ukraine to allow it to get into a stronger position before talks. Putin said he trusted no one and Russia would need written security guarantees in the event of a settlement. I dont trust anyone, but we need guarantees, and guarantees must be spelled out, they must be such that we would be satisfied, Putin said. Source: Reuters -Agencies",

        "date": "March 13, 2024 04:48 pm",
        "content": "Kairos, a small, solid-fuel rocket made by Japans Space One, exploded just seconds into its inaugural launch on Wednesday as the firm tried to become the first Japanese company to put a satellite in orbit. The setback for Space One and the rocket industry in Japan comes as the government and investors ramp up support for the sector amid a national security buildup and skyrocketing demand for commercial satellites. The 18-metre (59 ft) rocket exploded five seconds after lifting off, leaving behind a large cloud of smoke, a fire, fragments of the rocket and sprays of firefighting water near the launch pad on the tip of mountainous Kii peninsula in western Japan, visible on local media livestreams. The rocket terminated the flight after judging that the achievement of its mission would be difficult, company president Masakazu Toyoda said. Space One did not specify what triggered self-destruction after the first-stage engine ignited - or when the company would launch the next Kairos - only pledging an investigation into the explosion. The company said that the launch is highly automated, requiring only about a dozen ground staff, and that the rocket self-destructs when it detects errors in its flight path, speed or control system that could cause a crash that endangers people on the ground. We dont use the world failure, because each trial brings us ... new data and experience for another challenge, Toyoda told a news conference. There were no injuries near the launch pad, and the fire has been extinguished, Shuhei Kishimoto, governor of Wakayama prefecture, told reporters. Kairos carried an experimental government satellite that can temporarily replace intelligence satellites in orbit if they fall offline. Space One had planned the launch for Saturday but postponed it after a ship entered the nearby restricted sea area. SPACE COURIER SERVICES Although Japan is a relatively small player in the space race, the nations rocket developers are scrambling to build cheaper vehicles to capture booming demand for satellite launches from its government and from global clients. Tokyo-based Space One was established in 2018 by a consortium of Japanese companies: Canon Electronics, the aerospace engineering unit of IHI, construction firm Shimizu and the state-backed Development Bank of Japan. Two of Japans biggest banks, Mitsubishi UFJ and Mizuho (8411.T), also own minority stakes. Shares in Canon Electronics fell as much as 13, while IHI shares were down as much as 2 after Wednesdays failed launch. Space One wants to offer space courier services to domestic and international clients, aiming to launch 20 rockets a year by the late 2020s, Toyoda has said. Although the company delayed Kairos inaugural launch window four times, it said orders for its second and third planned trips have been filled, including by an overseas customer. Kairos is composed of three stages of solid-fuel engines and a liquid-fuel post-boost stage engine, attempting to carry payloads of up to 250 kg to low-Earth orbit. Space One does not disclose Kairos launch costs, but company executive Kozo Abe said it is competitive enough against American rival Rocket Lab. Rocket Lab has launched more than 40 Electron small rockets from New Zealand since 2017 at roughly 7 million per flight. Several Japanese companies have used Electron for their missions, including radar satellite makers and Synspective, and orbital debris-removal startup Astroscale. REVITALISING AN INDUSTRY Partnering with the United States, Japan is seeking to revitalise its domestic aerospace industry to counter technological and military rivals China and Russia. Last month, state-funded Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) successfully launched its new cost-efficient flagship rocket, the H3. JAXA completed a historic pinpoint moon landing this year, and the H3 is scheduled to carry about 20 satellites and probes to the space by 2030. Before that, however, JAXA had faced a series of setbacks. H3s inaugural flight failed last year, as did another flight of a smaller rocket, Epsilon, in 2022. In July 2023, an upgraded engine for Epsilon exploded at JAXAs testing site. In 2019, Interstellar Technologies conducted Japans first privately developed rocket launch with its MOMO series, although without a full-scale satellite payload. The government last year promised comprehensive support, for space startups with technology critical for national security, as it seeks to build satellite constellations to ramp up intelligence capabilities. Japans defence ministry on Friday said it had struck a deal with Space One to boost its rockets payload by experimenting with fuel-efficient methane engines. Rocket Lab, too, did not achieve its mission at the inaugural (Electron) flight, but it went on to launch three rockets in its second year, Toyoda said. We cant stop here  we need to compete with this company. Source: Reuters -Agencies",

        "title": "Govt to gradually allow essential vehicle imports starting next year - President",
        "date": "March 13, 2024 06:21 pm",
        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe underscored the consequences of political promises made without a comprehensive understanding of the countrys economy, highlighting the resulting hardships faced by the people. In a departure from such approaches, the President emphasized the importance of facing reality and working collectively towards a positive future for the nation. The President made these remarks during his presence in a convivial gathering organized by the United Youth Union, titled Future of the Youth, held yesterday (12) at Thaprobane Entertainment. The collapse of our countrys economy can largely be attributed to the unsustainable practice of providing everything for free. This approach ultimately burdens someone else, leading to economic instability, he said, responding to a question on increasing prices of mobile phones and internet service charges. He said the government is committed to implementing measures aimed at creating an economy that fosters self-sufficiency and financial resilience. While it may be tempting to make promises of free services, such as data, doing so would only exacerbate our economic challenges. Instead, our pledge is to focus on building a robust economy that empowers individuals to afford essential services and goods, he said. Wickremesinghe added that providing everything for free may lead to disruptions such as power and fuel shortages in the future, reminiscent of darker times in the countrys history. Asked about plans to ease restrictions on the importation of vehicles, he said that the government aims to initiate this process gradually from the following year. While acknowledging the challenges in the automobile market, he stressed that Sri Lankas current balance of payments situation is not favorable and that although most imports are permitted, restrictions remain on vehicle imports. However, starting next year, we intend to gradually allow essential vehicle imports. This year, weve permitted the importation of buses for tourist transportation as a step toward this goal, he explained. Addressing the audience, President Wickremesinghe stressed the imperative of transitioning swiftly to an export-oriented economy as a key aspect of economic development. The event saw the attendance of numerous young individuals representing diverse sectors, who directly posed questions to the President. In return, President Wickremesinghe offered constructive responses to their inquiries and engaged in friendly interactions with the attendees. In recognition of presence of the President, Mr. Neomal Perera, advisor to the United Youth Union, presented a commemorative gift to the President, marking the significance of his participation in the event. The exchange of questions and answers between President Ranil Wickremesinghe and the attendees encompassed various pertinent topics concerning the countrys future trajectory and the challenges ahead. Question: The current increase in the price of mobile phones coupled with rising internet service charges has posed challenges for many individuals. However, the online education system introduced during the recent period of the COVID-19 pandemic has proven to be a significant convenience for students. What measures have been implemented to enhance the digital literacy of youth in response to these challenges? Answer: The collapse of our countrys economy can largely be attributed to the unsustainable practice of providing everything for free. This approach ultimately burdens someone else, leading to economic instability. In Sri Lanka, we adopted a policy of extensive free relief, even resorting to printing money when faced with a lack of income. This reckless strategy made it impossible to honour our foreign debts, resulting in a severe economic crisis. As a responsible government, we understand that strengthening the economy is paramount to ensuring the well-being of our people. We are committed to implementing measures aimed at creating an economy that fosters self-sufficiency and financial resilience. Currently, our currency faces significant devaluation, with the exchange rate reaching approximately Rs. 310 for one US dollar. This dire situation necessitates urgent action. While it may be tempting to make promises of free services, such as data, doing so would only exacerbate our economic challenges. Instead, our pledge is to focus on building a robust economy that empowers individuals to afford essential services and goods. Providing everything for free may lead to disruptions such as power and fuel shortages in the future, reminiscent of darker times in our history. It is incumbent upon all of us to prioritize fiscal prudence and responsible economic management to prevent regression into past economic turmoil. Through concerted efforts and prudent policies, we can overcome our current crisis and build a prosperous future for Sri Lanka. Question: There are individuals seeking to leverage their talents for business endeavours without being a burden to the government. What avenues exist to provide contribution for them? Additionally, what measures are in place for student recruitment into the teaching profession, particularly in the Sabaragamuwa province? Answer: Regarding the recruitment of teachers, an ongoing court case has resulted in a postponement of appointments as certain individuals have raised concerns about perceived injustices in the selection process. We anticipate a resolution to this legal matter in the near future, allowing recruitment proceedings to proceed smoothly. In addressing the needs of self-employed entrepreneurs, particularly amidst economic challenges, careful consideration is given to avoid exacerbating financial instability. To support this vital sector, bank loans are being allocated based on the priorities of self-employed individuals. Recognizing the importance of tourism-related self-employment, efforts are underway to prioritize this area given the promising growth of the tourism industry in the country. Question: Athletes have encountered nutritional challenges. What steps have the government taken to address this issue? Answer: The Ministry of Sports has initiated relief efforts to address the nutritional needs of athletes. Plans are underway to implement more comprehensive and organized strategies to enhance athletes nutrition in the future. It is imperative to start addressing athletes nutritional requirements from a young age, with a focus on athletes as young as 8 years old. Private institutions are encouraged to contribute to improving the nutritional status of school athletes. Furthermore, a program has been devised to provide athletes with necessary medical advice, as well as the provision of sports attire. In countries where sports have reached commercial levels, private entities play a significant role in supporting athletes directly. Sri Lanka aims to develop its sports sector to a commercial level in the up-coming decade, with the government committed to providing necessary support for this transformation. Question: Rather than solely relying on the Rs. 5000 distributed through the Aswesuma program, wouldnt it be more effective to implement a program providing capital and training individuals based on their skills to strengthen the economy? Answer: During our nations challenging times, our primary focus was on ensuring the survival of our people. Addressing immediate needs was paramount before delving into broader economic initiatives. Discussions with international bodies like the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank underscored the importance of supporting vulnerable populations. To initiate assistance, we secured a USD 100 million grant from the World Bank to kick start the Aswesuma program. However, the funds provided through the Aswesuma program alone are insufficient. Hence, we devised a strategy to triple the initial amount through guarantees, ensuring direct financial support to eligible individuals. This aid is crucial for enabling people to progress in their endeavours. Notably, the spending of these funds by low-income individuals stimulates market activity, subsequently bolstering the economy. Moreover, the allocation of funds through decentralized budgets and rural development initiatives circulates money back into government coffers. By reviving rural industries and supporting small-scale entrepreneurs, we aim to augment the countrys economic output. Our economic advancement also hinges on agricultural productivity, with concerted efforts in place to enhance yields starting from 2023. Furthermore, initiatives such as granting free land rights and transferring ownership of housing units to low-income residents in the Western Province contribute to broader socioeconomic empowerment. These multifaceted approaches are pivotal in fostering sustainable economic growth and prosperity for all citizens. Question: Wouldnt it be beneficial to provide improved communication facilities to children in remote areas to facilitate their education? Answer: This is indeed a challenge in certain regions. As we progress towards a digital economy, access to modern communication infrastructure becomes increasingly crucial, particularly for remote communities. Efforts are underway to enhance these facilities at a grassroots level. Notably, the privatization of the SLT has prompted directives for increased investment in infrastructure development. The transition to a digital economy is imperative for national progress and collaboration with the private sector is essential given the governments financial constraints. Question: There seems to be no method for recovering funds lost due to fraud during the previous regime. Is there a plan to enact legislation preventing such financial misconduct in the future? Answer: As a nation, we are burdened with a substantial amount of debt, prompting my request for an extension until 2042 to repay these loans. Therefore, claims suggesting that a single individual or a select few can resolve this issue are entirely unfounded. To address concerns related to corruption and financial mismanagement, we have established a new commission. This commission operates independently, allowing anyone to come forward and provide relevant information without government interference. Legal actions have been taken against those individuals implicated in corruption cases, and efforts are ongoing to gather evidence against others involved. Our commitment to combating corruption remains steadfast. Numerous cases have been filed, and an independent commission has been tasked with investigating allegations of corruption. Recognizing the importance of adequate resources for these investigations, we have sought assistance from foreign countries to bolster our efforts. It is imperative that those responsible for defrauding the country are held accountable, and efforts to recover misappropriated funds must be pursued vigorously. Simultaneously, we must implement comprehensive programs to revitalize the nations economy. It is crucial to understand that addressing corruption and economic recovery are distinct yet interconnected challenges that require our unwavering commitment and resolve. Question: The film industry lacks recognition as an official industry and faces challenges in distribution. Can measures be taken to grant the film industry the privileges enjoyed by other industries and address distribution shortcomings? Answer: The film industry faces challenges in swiftly delivering completed films to audiences despite the significant time and effort invested in their creation, often taking up to five years. Its imperative that films are promptly presented to viewers once completed. This issue is currently under discussion, with efforts aimed at finding solutions. Furthermore, the development of the film industry hinges on the availability of high-quality cinemas. To achieve this, we must consider opening up the cinema market, akin to practices in other countries. However, economic viability is paramount, and any investment must yield appropriate returns. Hence, discussions are underway to address this challenge and ensure the sustainable growth of the cinema industry. Question: Could you outline the economic challenges facing the country and propose solutions to expedite economic recovery? Answer: The economic crisis in our country has deep roots that extend back over a considerable period. Following the war, our exports dwindled while imports surged, leading to a significant trade imbalance. Regrettably, our focus on agriculture waned, resulting in the collapse of vital industries such as tea, coconut, and rubber. Our flawed land policies drove foreign tea cultivators to seek greener pastures in countries like Africa and Kenya, where they flourished, leaving us to rue missed opportunities. Our failure to nurture the export sector is glaring. Reflecting on my tenure as Minister of Industry in 1991, I recall being asked by Vietnams Minister of Industry how we planned to develop our industries. Now, the tables have turned, and I find myself posing the same question. Politicians have made lofty promises, yet weve often failed to confront harsh realities. Bangladeshs journey from economic adversity to generosity serves as a stark reminder of our own lapses. We must move forward with a clear understanding of our past missteps, eschewing empty promises for pragmatic action. Some advocate for an inward-focused economy, but history teaches us otherwise. King Parakramabahu understood the imperative of exports, and so must we. Accepting my current position was not a decision born of eagerness but of necessity. Yet, amidst diverse claims and theories, one truth remains: if our imports consistently outweigh exports, borrowing becomes unsustainable. Amidst the turmoil, some have sought migrate abroad, but comparing our challenges to those of other nations offers no solace. Let us rally together to confront our challenges head-on, for the road ahead is fraught with difficulties. I extend an invitation to all to join hands in rebuilding our nation and forging a brighter future. Question: Studies have indicated that sanitary napkins are subject to a high tax rate of 47. Minister Ranjith Siyambalapitiya refuted this claim today, but the issue persists, causing concern. It is crucial to ascertain the truth regarding this matter. Answer: The minister has addressed this concern, but there are additional challenges such as currency depreciation contributing to price increases. Consequently, accessibility to sanitary napkins for nearly half the female population has become problematic. The government is actively considering how to address this issue, balancing tax obligations with affordability. Its a pressing matter that requires attention, and I acknowledge its significance. Question: Is there a plan to ease the importation of private vehicles this year? Answer: We aim to initiate this process gradually from the following year. While acknowledging the challenges in the automobile market, our current balance of payments situation is not favorable. Although most imports are permitted, restrictions remain on vehicle imports. However, starting next year, we intend to gradually allow essential vehicle imports. This year, weve permitted the importation of buses for tourist transportation as a step toward this goal.",

Police Media Spokesman DIG Nihala Thalduwa said the arrest was carried out in connection with the import of substandard Human Immunoglobulin vials. Eight individuals including former Health Minister Keheliya Rambukwella, former Health Ministry Secretary Janaka Chandragupta and Additional Secretary of the Health Ministry Dr. Saman Ratnayake currently remain under remand custody in connection with the case. Meanwhile on March 06, Dr. Ratnayake made a 4-hour-long confidential statement to the Maligakanda Magistrate regarding the procurement of substandard human intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG). In October 2023, the National Medicines Regulatory Authority (NMRA) revealed that forged documents were found to have been submitted for Customs clearance to procure a batch of vials containing human immunoglobulin, an antibody produced by blood plasma cells, which later failed the quality tests. The product, which was said to have been manufactured by Livealth Biopharma Pvt Ltd. India, was imported by a local medicine supplier called Isolez Biotech Pharma AG (Pvt) Ltd. However, the India-based manufacturer has denied having a hand in this fraudulent activity and communicated to the NMRA that it has neither manufactured, supplied nor exported these products to any party. Reportedly, funds amounting to Rs. 144 million have been misappropriated through the unlawful procurement of 22,500 vials of IVIG.",

        "date": "March 13, 2024 09:21 pm",
        "content": "The U.S. House of Representatives overwhelmingly passed a bill on Wednesday that would give TikToks Chinese owner ByteDance about six months to divest the U.S. assets of the short-video app used by about 170 million Americans or face a ban. The bill passed 352-65, with bipartisan support, but it faces a more uncertain path in the Senate where some favor a different approach to regulating foreign-owned apps that could pose security concerns. Democratic Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer has not indicated how he plans to proceed. TikToks fate has become a major issue in Washington. Democratic and Republican lawmakers said their offices had received large volumes of calls from teenaged TikTok users who oppose the legislation, with the volume of complaints at times exceeding the number of calls seeking a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas in Gaza. The measure is the latest in a series of moves in Washington to respond to U.S. national security concerns about China, from connected vehicles to advanced artificial intelligence chips to cranes at U.S. ports. This is a critical national security issue. The Senate must take this up and pass it, No. 2 House Republican Steve Scalise said on social media platform X. Shortly after passage, a bipartisan pair of senators, Democrat Mark Warner and Republican Marco Rubio, issued a joint statement saying they were encouraged by the bipartisan support for the bill and that they look forward to working together to get this bill passed through the Senate and signed into law. The vote comes just over a week since the bill was proposed following one public hearing with little debate, and after action in Congress had stalled for more than a year. Last month, President Joe Bidens re-election campaign joined TikTok, raising hopes among TikTok officials that legislation was unlikely this year. The House Energy and Commerce Committee last week voted 50-0 in favor of the bill, setting it up for a vote before the full House. TIKTOK CEO GOES TO WASHINGTON TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew will visit Capitol Hill on Wednesday on a previously scheduled trip to talk to senators, a source briefed on the matter said. This legislation has a predetermined outcome: a total ban of TikTok in the United States, the company said before the vote. The government is attempting to strip 170 million Americans of their Constitutional right to free expression, it added. Biden said last week that he would sign the bill. White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan said on Tuesday the goal was ending Chinese ownership, not banning TikTok. Do we want TikTok, as a platform, to be owned by an American company or owned by China? Do we want the data from TikTok - childrens data, adults data - to be going, to be staying here in America or going to China? he said. It is unclear whether China would approve any sale or if TikToks U.S. assets could be divested in six months. If ByteDance failed to do so, app stores operated by Apple, Alphabets, Google and others could not legally offer TikTok or provide web hosting services to ByteDance-controlled applications. In 2020, then-President Donald Trump sought to ban TikTok and Chinese-owned WeChat but was blocked by the courts. In recent days he had raised concerns about a ban. It remains unclear if Tencents (0700.HK), WeChat or other high-profile Chinese-owned apps could face a ban under the legislation. Any forced TikTok divestment from the U.S. would almost certainly face legal challenges, which the company would need to file within 165 days of the bill being signed by the president. In November, a U.S. judge blocked a Montana state ban on TikTok use after the company sued. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

Democratic and Republican lawmakers said their offices had received large volumes of calls from teenaged TikTok users who oppose the legislation, with the volume of complaints at times exceeding the number of calls seeking a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas in Gaza. The measure is the latest in a series of moves in Washington to respond to U.S. national security concerns about China, from connected vehicles to advanced artificial intelligence chips to cranes at U.S. ports. This is a critical national security issue. The Senate must take this up and pass it, No. 2 House Republican Steve Scalise said on social media platform X. Shortly after passage, a bipartisan pair of senators, Democrat Mark Warner and Republican Marco Rubio, issued a joint statement saying they were encouraged by the bipartisan support for the bill and that they look forward to working together to get this bill passed through the Senate and signed into law. The vote comes just over a week since the bill was proposed following one public hearing with little debate, and after action in Congress had stalled for more than a year. Last month, President Joe Bidens re-election campaign joined TikTok, raising hopes among TikTok officials that legislation was unlikely this year. The House Energy and Commerce Committee last week voted 50-0 in favor of the bill, setting it up for a vote before the full House. TIKTOK CEO GOES TO WASHINGTON TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew will visit Capitol Hill on Wednesday on a previously scheduled trip to talk to senators, a source briefed on the matter said. This legislation has a predetermined outcome: a total ban of TikTok in the United States, the company said before the vote. The government is attempting to strip 170 million Americans of their Constitutional right to free expression, it added. Biden said last week that he would sign the bill. White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan said on Tuesday the goal was ending Chinese ownership, not banning TikTok. Do we want TikTok, as a platform, to be owned by an American company or owned by China? Do we want the data from TikTok - childrens data, adults data - to be going, to be staying here in America or going to China? he said. It is unclear whether China would approve any sale or if TikToks U.S. assets could be divested in six months. If ByteDance failed to do so, app stores operated by Apple, Alphabets, Google and others could not legally offer TikTok or provide web hosting services to ByteDance-controlled applications. In 2020, then-President Donald Trump sought to ban TikTok and Chinese-owned WeChat but was blocked by the courts. In recent days he had raised concerns about a ban. It remains unclear if Tencents (0700.HK), WeChat or other high-profile Chinese-owned apps could face a ban under the legislation. Any forced TikTok divestment from the U.S. would almost certainly face legal challenges, which the company would need to file within 165 days of the bill being signed by the president. In November, a U.S. judge blocked a Montana state ban on TikTok use after the company sued. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "content": "A Chinese military delegation recently visited the Maldives, Sri Lanka and Nepal to discuss further cooperation in defence issues, Beijing said Wednesday. Beijing is seeking to build closer ties in South Asia in a push to counter its strategic rival India for influence. Last week, the Maldives said it had signed a military assistance deal with China after ordering Indian troops deployed in the small but strategically-placed archipelago to leave. And Beijing confirmed Wednesday that a delegation had visited the country and met with pro-China President Mohamed Muizzu during a trip that also took them to Sri Lanka and Nepal from March 4 to 13. In all three countries, they exchanged views on military relations and regional security issues of common concern, the Chinese military said in a statement on its official WeChat account. The delegation of officials from the militarys international military cooperation department focused on in-depth consultations on promoting bilateral defence cooperation. A series of consensus was reached to further enriched defence cooperation between the PLA and the relevant countries, it added, referring to the Chinese military by its official acronym. India is suspicious of Chinas growing presence in the Indian Ocean and its influence in the Maldives, a chain of 1,192 tiny coral islands stretching around 800 kilometres (500 miles) across the equator, as well as in neighbouring Sri Lanka. Both South Asian island nations are strategically placed halfway along key east-west international shipping routes. Beijing also enjoys close ties with Nepal, led by Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal, an ex-Maoist guerrilla known by his nom de guerre Prachanda. Source: AFP --Agencies",

        "date": "March 13, 2024 10:20 pm",
        "content": "State Minister of Fisheries, Piyal Nishantha de Silva, announced plans to launch a new multi-day fishing trawler equipped with modern technology and advanced operational techniques to enhance the fishing industry. The State Minister further stated that President Ranil Wickremesinghe has instructed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, via the Attorney General, to facilitate the swift repatriation of the fishermen aboard the Lorenzo Putha-4 fishing vessel back to Sri Lanka. These statements were made by the State Minister during a press briefing held at the Presidential Media Centre today (13), focusing on the theme Collective Path to a Stable Country. Expressing his views further State Minister Piyal Nishantha de Silva said; Efforts have been undertaken to safeguard the quality of fish products as part of the on-going development of the fishing industry. However, challenges have arisen due to the rising fuel costs and the increased prices of fishing equipment, impacting the income of the fishing community. Nonetheless, it is worth noting that measures are being implemented to mitigate these challenges and improve the situation for the fishing community. A committee comprising experts is actively planning the necessary initiatives to introduce a modern multi-day fishing trawler equipped with advanced technology and operational methods tailored for the fishing industry. Upon completion of the planning phase, production of the new fishing trawler will commence. The primary objective is to ensure a sustainable fishing industry through effective management of fishing resources and inputs. Additionally, the World Food Organization (WFO) has initiated several pilot projects. Among these initiatives is the development of a new trawler under the Ocean Freight Replenishment Program (OFRP), designed in collaboration with the World Food Organization to align with changing times and incorporate climate change and alternative technologies. Moreover, discussions have taken place between our ministry, President Ranil Wickremesinghe, and relevant institutions regarding the introduction of mechanical boats and boats utilizing solar technology, emphasizing a commitment to embracing environmentally friendly and sustainable practices. Furthermore, with support from the Australian Government, a fishing vessel monitoring system has been implemented for multi-day fishing trawlers in our country. Currently, the system has been installed on 2350 multi-day fishing trawlers, with plans to cover all 4200 targeted fishing vessels by the end of the first quarter of next year, enhancing monitoring and management capabilities in the fishing industry. Currently, there are on-going efforts at the research level to forecast fishing grounds using vessel observation data. The necessary analysis software has already been developed, and plans are in place to integrate this fishing ground forecasting service once the fishing vessel monitoring system becomes fully operational next year. Additionally, preparations are underway to update the Fisheries Act and introduce a new Act to replace the existing Fisheries Act of 1996. This initiative reflects a proactive approach to adapt to changing times and address emerging challenges. It is anticipated that the new legislation will include stringent measures to combat illegal fishing activities. Moreover, diplomatic discussions are being conducted between countries to develop a comprehensive action plan aimed at addressing various issues plaguing the fishing industry, demonstrating a commitment to finding sustainable solutions through international cooperation. Furthermore, discussions have taken place between the Department of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources, Sri Lanka Navy and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs regarding the situation involving the Lorenzo Putha-4 vessel. The legal procedures are being conducted in accordance with the laws of Seychelles. President Ranil Wickremesinghe has instructed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, through the Attorney General, to expedite the legal proceedings in Seychelles and facilitate the repatriation of the fishermen to Sri Lanka at the earliest opportunity. --PMD--",

The Sri Lankan envoy made these remarks when he called on the newly appointed Foreign Minister of Bangladesh Dr. Hasan Mahmud in Dhaka on Monday. He highlighted that the relations between the two countries have prevailed for centuries and the people-to-people contacts have been growing stronger over the years. Underscoring the need to find new avenues to further improve trade and investment and pave the way for two-way partnerships to develop the respective economies, High Commissioner Weerakkody mentioned that the two countries are currently negotiating to finalize a Preferential Trading Agreement (PTA), which will further improve trade sector cooperation.

        "date": "March 14, 2024 08:32 am",
        "content": "The number of children globally who died before their fifth birthday dropped to a record low of 4.9 million in 2022, but that still represents one death every six seconds, according to new United Nations estimates. While the mortality rate for under-5s has roughly halved since 2000, the world is still behind in the goal of reducing preventable deaths in that age group by 2030, and progress has slowed since 2015, the report, released on Wednesday, found. The numbers represent an important milestone, said Juan Pablo Uribe, director for health nutrition and population at the World Bank, one of the partners that put together the report alongside Unicef, the U.N. population division and the World Health Organization. But this is simply not enough. The picture is varied. Some countries, like Cambodia, Malawi and Mongolia, have reduced under-5 mortality rates by more than 75 since 2000. Overall, deaths in babies and children under-5 in 2022 were concentrated in sub-Saharan Africa, which represented 57 of the global total despite only making up 30 of the live births that year. Southern Asia had around a quarter of both deaths and live births. Around half of the deaths globally are among newborns, the report said. The report was limited by a lack of data in the worst-affected countries, the U.N. partners added. The deaths were largely caused by preventable or treatable causes, such as pre-term birth, pneumonia or diarrhea. Better access to primary health care and community health workers could vastly improve the outlook, the U.N. said, although climate change, increasing inequity, conflict and the long-term fall-out of COVID-19 could all threaten progress.

As such, a vote on the no-confidence motion will be taken at 04:30 p.m. on 20 March (Wednesday). The no-confidence motion against Speaker Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena was handed over to the Deputy General Secretary of Parliament on 05 March.

        "content": "The 19-year-old Sri Lankan student Febrio De-Zoysa, who was charged with the mass killing in Ottawas Barrhaven on March 06, is expected to produce before the court again today (March 14). De-Zoysa, who was living with the victims at the time, is currently housed in Ottawas Innes Road jail while facing six charges of first-degree murder and one count of attempted murder. Meanwhile, the 19-year-old was reportedly known for posting videos of the video game Minecraft on YouTube, however, Google has taken steps to terminate the YouTube channel associated with the suspect citing that if a users off-platform behaviour harms the YouTube community, they may take action in accordance with YouTubes creator responsibility guidelines. Foreign media reports claim that the case could take two to three years to work its way through the court system, according to criminal law experts. Daphne Gilbert, a professor of criminal law at the University of Ottawa told MSN news agency that the accused will likely go through extensive psychiatric evaluations to determine whether or not hes fit to stand trial. Additionally, the police investigation will likely be lengthy and complex, she said. In the meantime, Ottawa Police, which carries out investigations of the case say they are still working to determine the alleged killers motive. Canadian local news agencies also reported that police are still trying to determine if one or multiple knives were used in the attack. Six Sri Lankan people, including a mother, her four young children and a family acquaintance, were found dead inside a townhouse in the south Ottawa suburb of Barrhaven in the late hours of March 06. The womans husband and father of the children remain in hospital with serious injuries sustained during the attack. Their bodies were found by police inside a townhouse the family was renting on Berrigan Drive near Palmadeo Drive in the capitals southern suburbs, after the police received 911 calls to the home late on Wednesday night. Dhanushka Wickramasinghe, the father of the family, was the sole survivor of the attack. The family was newcomers to Canada from Sri Lanka. They are:  Darshani Dilanthika Ekanayake (35-year-old mother)  Inuka Wickramasinghe (7-year-old son)  Ashwini Wickramasinghe (4-year-old daughter)  Rinyana Wickramasinghe (2-year-old daughter)  Kelly Wickramasinghe (2-month-old daughter) On March 07, Algonquin College president Claude Brulé, in which the accused is said to have been a student, released a statement confirming De-Zoysa was a student at the college and that it appears his last semester of attendance was Winter 2023. --With agencies inputs",

Alexander died Monday at the age of 78 at a Dallas hospital, said Daniel Spinks, a longtime friend. He said Alexander had recently been hospitalized after being diagnosed with COVID-19 but he did not know the cause of death. Alexander contracted polio in 1952, when he was 6. He became paralyzed from the neck down and he began using an iron lung, a cylinder that encased his body as the air pressure in the chamber forced air into and out of his lungs. He had millions of views on his TikTok account. He loved to laugh, Spinks said. He was just one of the bright stars of this world. In one of his Conversations With Paul posts on TikTok, Alexander tells viewers that being positive is a way of life for me as his head rests on a pillow and the iron lung can be heard whirring in the background. Spinks said Alexanders positivity had a profound effect on those around him. Being around Paul was an enlightenment in so many ways, Spinks said. Spinks said that Alexander had learned how to gulp air down his lungs in order to be out of the iron lung for part of the day. Using a stick in his mouth, Alexander could type on a computer and use the phone, Spinks said. As he got older he had more difficulties in breathing outside the lung for periods of time so he really just retired back to the lung, Spinks said. Gary Cox, who has been friends with Alexander since college, said his friend was always smiling. He was so friendly, Cox said. He was always happy. A book Alexander wrote about his life, Three Minutes for a Dog: My Life in an Iron Lung, was published in 2020. Cox said that the title comes from a promise Alexanders nurse made him when he was a young boy: Hed get a dog if he could teach himself to breathe on his own for three minutes. That took a good maybe two years, three years before he was able to stay out for three minutes and then five minutes and then 10 minutes and then eventually he got the strength to learn to stay out all day, said Cox. And, indeed, Alexander did get that puppy. Alexander, who earned a bachelors degree in economics in 1978 from the University of Texas and a law degree from the school in 1984, was a driven man who had a strong faith in God, said Spinks. They became friends in 2000, when Cox took a job as his driver and helper. He said he would drive Alexander to the courthouse, and then push him to his court proceedings in his wheelchair. At the time, he said, Alexander could spend about four to six hours outside of an iron lung, and would be in an iron lung when he was at his office or home. Spinks only worked for Alexander for about a year though they remained friends, and Spinks said he was among the friends who helped maintain and repair Alexanders iron lungs. There were a couple of close calls when his lung would break and I would rush out there and we would have to do some repairs on it, Spinks said. Cox said that at one point, he and his brother got an iron lung off eBay and drove to Chicago to pick it up, bringing it back to Dallas and refurbishing it. They quit making them, Cox said. They quit supplying the parts for them. You cant even get a collar for them anymore. Polio was once one of the nations most feared diseases, with annual outbreaks causing thousands of cases of paralysis. The disease primarily affects children. Vaccines became available starting in 1955. According to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, a national vaccination campaign cut the annual number of U.S. cases to less than 100 in the 1960s and fewer than 10 in the 1970s. In 1979, polio was declared eliminated in the U.S., meaning it was no longer routinely spread. Spinks said that Alexander loved being interviewed, and had a passion to show that disabled people had a place in society. Chris Ulmer, founder of Special Books By Special Kids, a social media platform that gives disabled people a way to share their stories, interviewed Alexander in 2022. Paul himself really loved inspiring people and letting them know that they are capable of great things, Ulmer said. He just had such a vibrant and joyful energy around him that was contagious, he said. Cox said that over the years, people around the globe sought Alexander out to hear his inspirational story. If he set his mind to it, he could do it, Cox said. Source: The Associated Press --Agencies",

        "date": "March 14, 2024 03:39 pm",
        "content": "Maligakanda Magistrates Court has once again rejected bail for former Minister of Health Keheliya Rambukwella, former Ministry secretary and 04 others accused over the import of substandard human Immunoglobulin vials. Furthermore, the magistrate who ordered them to be remanded in custody until conclusion of the case under the provisions of the Public Property Act, also ordered the case to be recalled on March 28, 2024. Eight individuals including former Health Minister Keheliya Rambukwella, former Health Ministry Secretary Janaka Chandragupta and Additional Secretary of the Health Ministry Dr. Saman Ratnayake currently remain under remand custody following their arrest in connection with the case. The Criminal Investigation Department (CID) arrested Rambukwella on 02 February in connection with the procurement of substandard human intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), when he arrived there, complying with a court order. He had been grilled for nearly 10 hours before being arrested. The arrest came hot on the heels of pressure from civil society activists and health sector trade unionists, who called for the immediate apprehension of the lawmaker. However, on 29 February, Rambukwellas attorneys also filed a Fundamental Rights (FR) petition challenging his arrest by the CID and demanding Rs. 100 million in compensation. Prior to the apprehension of Rambukwella, seven arrests had been made in connection with the drug procurement scam. But the fifth accused was later released on bail. As such, the former Health Secretary, the Director of the Health Ministrys Medical Supplies Division (MSD) and three other officials of the same division, as well as the owner of the company, which is said to have supplied the substandard batch of immunoglobulin vials, now remain in remand custody. Meanwhile on Wednesday (March 13), the CID arrested Dr. Thusitha Sudarshana, the Deputy Director of the Health Ministrys Medical Supplies Division, after he surrendered to the CID based on summons, following his arrival in Sri Lanka from overseas. In the meantime, Additional Secretary of the Health Ministry Dr. Ratnayake had recently made a 4-hour-long confidential statement to the Maligakanda Magistrate regarding the procurement of substandard human intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG). In October 2023, the National Medicines Regulatory Authority (NMRA) revealed that forged documents were found to have been submitted for Customs clearance to procure a batch of vials containing human immunoglobulin, an antibody produced by blood plasma cells, which later failed the quality tests.",
