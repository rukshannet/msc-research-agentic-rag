        "date": "November 21, 2024 10:00 am",
        "content": "Gautam Adani, the billionaire chair of Indian conglomerate Adani Group and one of the worlds richest people, has been indicted in New York over his role in a 265 million bribery scheme, according to U.S. prosecutors. Authorities said Adani and seven other defendants, including his nephew Sagar Adani, agreed to pay the bribes to Indian government officials to obtain contracts expected to yield 2 billion of profit over 20 years, and develop Indias largest solar power plant project. A judge has issued arrest warrants for Gautam Adani and Sagar Adani and prosecutors plan to hand those warrants to foreign law enforcement, court records show. Fallout for the Adani empire was immediate. Adani Green Energy cancelled plans on Thursday to raise 600 million in U.S. dollar-denominated bonds, according to four sources with direct knowledge of the matter. The bond had been priced but was pulled following the news. In early Asian trading on Thursday, Adani dollar bonds slumped, with prices down between 3-5c on bonds for Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone . The falls were the largest since the Adani Group came under a short-seller attack in February 2023. Prosecutors also said the Adanis and another executive at Adani Green Energy, former CEO Vneet Jaain, raised more than 3 billion in loans and bonds by hiding their corruption from lenders and investors. According to the indictment, some conspirators referred privately to Gautam Adani with the code names Numero uno and the big man, while Sagar Adani allegedly used his cellphone to track specifics about the bribes. The Adani Group has not responded to requests for comment on the indictment. Shares in GQG Partners, an Australia-listed investment firm that is a major Adani backer, slid 20. The decline was the stocks largest one-day fall since it listed three years ago. GQG last year bought 3.4 of Adani Enterprises - the groups flagship firm, 4.1 of Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone , 2.5 of Adani Transmission and 3.5 of Adani Green Energy. It said in a statement that it was monitoring the charges. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "date": "November 21, 2024 11:19 am",
        "content": "Former Ministers Ramesh Pathirana, Roshan Ranasinghe and Prasanna Ranatunga have arrived at the Criminal Investigations Department (CID) this morning (21), in order to provide statements pertaining to the alleged importation of substandard human immunoglobulin vials. Meanwhile, former Minister Harin Fernando has reportedly informed that he will appear before the CID tomorrow (22) to record a statement regarding the matter. On November 12, the Maligakanda Magistrates Court had ordered to record statements from 18 then-Cabinet Ministers pertaining to the alleged importation of substandard human immunoglobulin vials. The Attorney Generals Department has informed the court that statements are required to be obtained from 18 individuals including former President Ranil Wickremesinghe, former Prime Minister Dinesh Gunawardena, former Ministers Tiran Alles, Mahinda Amaraweera, Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe, Harin Fernando, Roshan Ranasinghe and Nimal Siripala who were members of the Cabinet which approved the Cabinet paper presented by then Health Minister Keheliya Rambukwella for the import of the controversial drugs in question. Maligakanda Magistrate Lochani Abeywickrema, who granted permission for the request, ordered to record statements from the 18 former Cabinet members related to the matter. In October 2023, the National Medicines Regulatory Authority (NMRA) revealed that forged documents were found to have been submitted for Customs clearance to procure a batch of vials containing human immunoglobulin, an antibody produced by blood plasma cells, which later failed the quality tests. Prior to the apprehension of Rambukwella, seven arrests had been made in connection with the alleged drug procurement scam. But the fifth accused was later released on bail. As such, the former Health Secretary, former Additional Health Secretary, the Director of the Health Ministrys Medical Supplies Division (MSD) and three other officials of the same division, as well as the owner of the company, which is said to have supplied the substandard batch of immunoglobulin vials, were arrested and remanded over the case. Meanwhile, one of the suspects in the case, former Deputy Director of the Medical Supplies Division of the Health Ministry, Dr. Thusitha Sudarshana, was released on bail when the case was previously taken up on May 06. Meanwhile, the Court of Appeal on July 25 ordered the Maligakanda Magistrates Court to release on bail the former Director of the Health Ministrys Medical Supplies Division, Dr. Kapila Wickramanayake, who was also in remand custody. Accordingly, a total of 12 suspects had been arrested and remanded over the case while presently all but one of them are out on bail. The first accused, the owner of the company that supplied the substandard drugs, Sudath Janaka Fernando is receiving treatment while under remand custody. Former Health Minister Kehliya Rambukwella, who was in remand custody for over seven months, was released on bail on September 11, 2024.",

        "title": "Ukraine fires UK-supplied Storm Shadow missiles into Russia for first time",
        "date": "November 21, 2024 11:49 am",
        "content": "Ukraine fired a volley of British Storm Shadow cruise missiles into Russia on Wednesday, the latest new Western weapon it has been permitted to use on Russian targets a day after it fired U.S. ATACMS missiles. The strikes were widely reported by Russian war correspondents on Telegram and confirmed by an official on condition of anonymity. A spokesperson for Ukraines General Staff said he had no information. Moscow has said the use of Western weapons to strike Russian territory far from the border would be a major escalation in the conflict. Kyiv says it needs the capability to defend itself by hitting Russian rear bases used to support Moscows invasion, which entered its 1,000th day this week. Accounts of Russian war correspondents on Telegram posted video they said included the sound of the missiles striking Kursk region, which borders northeastern Ukraine. At least 14 huge explosions could be heard, most of them preceded by the sharp whistle of what sounded like an incoming missile. The video, shot in a residential area, showed black smoke rising in the distance. The pro-Russian Two Majors channel on Telegram said Ukraine fired up to 12 Storm Shadows into the Kursk region and carried pictures of missile pieces with the name Storm Shadow clearly visible. A spokesperson for British Prime Minister Keir Starmer declined to comment. Britain had previously allowed Ukraine to use Storm Shadows, which have a range in excess of 250 km (155 miles), within Ukrainian territory. The Kyiv government has been pressing Western partners for permission to use such weapons to strike targets deep inside Russia, and it obtained the all-clear from U.S. President Joe Biden to use the ATACMS this week, two months before Biden leaves office. As Ukraines use of the missiles raised tensions, the United States shut its embassy in Kyiv on Wednesday as a precaution due to what it called the threat of a significant air attack. It later said the embassy would reopen on Thursday. The Pentagon on Wednesday also announced 275 million in military aid to Ukraine that included more ammunition for the HIMARS rocket system, and the Biden administration moved to forgive 4.7 billion in U.S. loans to Ukraine as outgoing officials sought to do what they could to bolster Kyiv before they leave office. Anticipating Trump Administration Bidens successor, President-elect Donald Trump, has said he will end the war, without saying how, and criticised billions of dollars in aid for Ukraine under Biden. The warring sides believe Trump is likely to push for peace talks - not known to have been held since the wars earliest months - and are trying to attain strong positions before negotiations. Kyiv says Moscow, which invaded Ukraine in February 2022, has previously taken advantage of limits on Ukraines use of weapons, particularly to strike Ukrainian cities from the air with heavy guided bombs. Western countries say the arrival of more than 10,000 North Korean troops to fight for Russia in recent weeks was an escalation that merited a response. The first use of the U.S. ATACMS on Tuesday, fired at a Russian arsenal in the Bryansk region on Ukraines northern border, prompted firm words from Moscow, which announced a change to its nuclear doctrine to lower the threshold for the use of atomic weapons. Washington has said it sees no need to adjust its own nuclear posture and accused Moscow of resorting to irresponsible rhetoric. Military analysts have said the longer-range missiles are unlikely to give Ukraine a decisive edge in the war but could strengthen its position, especially in the battle for a sliver of land inside Russias Kursk region it seized in August. An air raid siren in Kyiv in the early afternoon on Wednesday jangled nerves. But Ukraines military spy agency said a widely reported threat of massive drone and missile attacks across the country was fake, and it accused Russia of trying to sow panic by circulating online messages about it. The enemy, unable to subdue Ukrainians by force, resorts to measures of intimidation and psychological pressure on society. We ask you to be vigilant and steadfast, it said. With the U.S. embassys temporary closure, the Italian, Spanish and Greek embassies said they too had closed their doors in Kyiv. Canada said it suspended in-person services at its mission. The French embassy remained open but urged its citizens to be cautious. The Kremlin said it had no comment. Russian foreign intelligence chief Sergei Naryshkin said in an interview published on Wednesday that Moscow would retaliate against NATO countries that facilitate long-range Ukrainian missile strikes against Russian territory. The war is at a volatile juncture, with nearly a fifth of Ukrainian territory in Russian hands, North Korean troops deployed in Russias Kursk region and doubts over the future of Western aid under Trump, whose nominees for administration posts include sceptics of support for Kyiv. On Sunday, Russia staged a missile and drone strike on Ukraines national power grid that killed seven people and renewed fears over the durability of the hobbled energy network.

        "content": "Delivering the new governments policy statement, President Anura Kumara Dissanayake emphasized the importance of public accountability, highlighting that the Parliament is no longer a concealed institution to the general public. The Parliament is not a hidden cave anymore. Daily proceedings are open to public scrutiny. As representatives of the people, everything we dohow we speak, how we behaveis under their watchful eye. The publics duty does not end with electing us; they have the right to scrutinize us until the next mandate. I believe this Parliament is capable of passing such scrutiny, the President said, during the inaugural session of the 10th Parliament today (21). Addressing the public sectors critical role, President Dissanayake underlined the historic mandate given to his government by the public sector and the need to transform the public service into an efficient and people-centered institution. The mandate we received is the highest ever from public servants. Yet, neither the public nor public employees are satisfied with the state of the public service today. Our responsibility is to create a public service that satisfies both those who work in the sector and the people they serve, he stated. The President added: The public servants mandate represents their partiality in our policy for establishing a favourable public service. We cannot move forward without a strong public service. Public sector activity is important for the political authority as well. Dissanayake also reaffirmed his commitment to establishing an efficient and impartial public sector that works in the peoples favor, asserting that an effective public service is vital for political authority and public confidence alike. No one is above the law Emphasizing his vision for democracy, independence and justice, President Dissanayake declared: No one should be left behind based on religion, culture, language, or political ideology. Freedom belongs to everyone. It is our collective responsibility to create a democratic and free nation where people can live without fear or doubt. A cornerstone of this effort is upholding the rule of law. This cannot be achieved solely through legislation passed in Parliament; laws must be implemented effectively. The public must feel that justice is served. Over the past years, public trust in the legal system has been severely eroded. Furthermore, Dissanayake affirmed: The government and the presidency are not above the law. Authority figures will remain accountable. No one with authority is above the law. We are not here to exact revenge, but to ensure everyones right to participate in politics freely. The President assured that justice will be served for the victims of all high-profile and controversial crimes, and those found guilty will face punishment, noting, this is essential for restoring public confidence in the legal system. We must create a government where laws are fair and justice prevails. Failing to establish with this kind of a mandate would mean that we will never be able to do that. Without justice and fairness in addressing corruption and crime, the dreams of this country will perish, he expressed.",

        "content": "President Anura Kumara Dissanayake has expressed confidence that the staff-level agreement on the third review of the International Monetary Funds (IMF) Extended Fund Facility (EFF) arrangement for Sri Lanka could be finalized and signed by November 23. Highlighting the critical role of economic stability, the President underscored the importance of adhering to existing agreements. We inherited a country already bound by an agreement with the IMF when we assumed office. Breaking away from this agreement is not an option if we aim to progress, he stated, reiterating the governments commitment to managing the economy within the framework of the agreed parameters of the IMF. The President acknowledged the delay in the third review, initially scheduled for September, attributing it to the recent elections. However, he noted that the IMF delegation resumed discussions immediately after the 2024 General Election. We are engaged in extensive discussions, and we are hopeful of finalizing the staff-level agreement within this week. Signing the agreement on November 23 will mark a decisive step in advancing the IMF program, he added. Addressing the challenges of debt restructuring, the President explained that much of the groundwork had already been completed before his administration took office. Bilateral debt restructuring agreements were finalized, and discussions on sovereign bonds concluded just days before the Presidential Election, he added. Furthermore, Dissanayke expressed: Debating whether these agreements are good or bad is futile at this stage. Debt restructuring was at its final stages when we assumed power, and reopening discussions would stall economic progress for a longer period. Separate agreements with creditor nations will follow soon, while the sovereign bond agreement is expected to conclude by December. The President emphasized that signing the staff-level agreement with the IMF is a crucial step towards building a stable and reliable economic future for Sri Lanka, stating, The current economic climate leaves no room for error. By moving forward decisively, we can restore public and international confidence in our economy, he concluded.",

        "content": "British politician John Prescott, a former merchant seaman who rose to the post of deputy prime minister, has died at age 86. Prescotts family announced his death on Thursday. They said the politician, who had been suffering from Alzheimers disease, died peacefully in a care home on Wednesday with his loved ones around him. The family said Prescott had spent his life trying to improve the lives of others, fighting for social justice and protecting the environment. For a decade, Prescott brought grit, humor and working-class authenticity to the government of the young, polished Tony Blair, who became prime minister in 1997. He was one of the most talented people I ever encountered in politics, one of the most committed and loyal, and definitely the most unusual, Blair said. An amateur boxer in his youth, Prescott was a pugnacious politician who memorably punched a man who threw an egg at him during the 2001 general election. The uproar briefly looked like it might harm the party, and Prescotts career. But Blairs response - John is John - cemented his folksy status. Prescott entered politics through the trade union movement  a once-common route that became less frequent after Blair rebranded the left-leaning party New Labour and shifted its politics toward the center, He was a proud working-class figure in a country that still has few from that background at the top of politics. He unapologetically liked the finer things in life and was nicknamed Two Jags by the press because he had two Jaguar luxury cars. The egg-thrower punching incident earned him another nickname: Two Jabs Prescott served as Blairs deputy between 1997 and 2007. One of his proudest achievements was working with then-U.S. Vice President Al Gore on the landmark Kyoto Protocol climate change agreement in 1997. Gore said he had never worked with anyone in politics  on my side of the pond or his  quite like John Prescott. He fought like hell to negotiate the Kyoto Protocol and was an unwavering champion of climate action for decades to come. Im forever grateful to John for that commitment to solving the climate crisis and will miss him as a dear friend, Gore said in a statement. Prescott represented his home city of Hull in northern England for four decades. After Labour lost power in 2010 he was made a member of Parliaments unelected upper chamber, the House of Lords. Former Labour Prime Minister Gordon Brown said Prescott was a true working-class hero. He wanted the good things in life for everyone and not just himself, Brown said. And he showed that Britain can be a country where if you work hard you can fill your potential. He is survived by his wife Pauline and sons Johnathan and David. Source: AP --Agencies",

        "title": "US regulators seek to break up Google, forcing Chrome sale as part of monopoly punishment",
        "date": "November 21, 2024 03:22 pm",
        "content": "U.S. regulators want a federal judge to break up Google to prevent the company from continuing to squash competition through its dominant search engine after a court found it had maintained an abusive monopoly over the past decade. The proposed breakup floated in a 23-page document filed late Wednesday by the U.S. Department of Justice calls for sweeping punishments that would include a sale of Googles industry-leading Chrome web browser and impose restrictions to prevent Android from favoring its own search engine. A sale of Chrome will permanently stop Googles control of this critical search access point and allow rival search engines the ability to access the browser that for many users is a gateway to the internet, Justice Department lawyers argued in their filing. Although regulators stopped short of demanding Google sell Android too, they asserted the judge should make it clear the company could still be required to divest its smartphone operating system if its oversight committee continues to see evidence of misconduct. The broad scope of the recommended penalties underscores how severely regulators operating under President Joe Bidens administration believe Google should be punished following an August ruling by U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta that branded the company as a monopolist. The Justice Department decision-makers who will inherit the case after President-elect Donald Trump takes office next year might not be as strident. The Washington, D.C. court hearings on Googles punishment are scheduled to begin in April and Mehta is aiming to issue his final decision before Labor Day. If Mehta embraces the governments recommendations, Google would be forced to sell its 16-year-old Chrome browser within six months of the final ruling. But the company certainly would appeal any punishment, potentially prolonging a legal tussle that has dragged on for more than four years. Besides seeking a Chrome spinoff and a corralling of the Android software, the Justice Department wants the judge to ban Google from forging multibillion-dollar deals to lock in its dominant search engine as the default option on Apples iPhone and other devices. It would also ban Google from favoring its own services, such as YouTube or its recently-launched artificial intelligence platform, Gemini. Regulators also want Google to license the search index data it collects from peoples queries to its rivals, giving them a better chance at competing with the tech giant. On the commercial side of its search engine, Google would be required to provide more transparency into how it sets the prices that advertisers pay to be listed near the top of some targeted search results. Kent Walker, Googles chief legal officer, lashed out at the Justice Department for pursuing a radical interventionist agenda that would harm Americans and Americas global technology. In a blog post, Walker warned the overly broad proposal would threaten personal privacy while undermining Googles early leadership in artificial intelligence, perhaps the most important innovation of our time. Wary of Googles increasing use of artificial intelligence in its search results, regulators also advised Mehta to ensure websites will be able to shield their content from Googles AI training techniques. The measures, if they are ordered, threaten to upend a business expected to generate more than 300 billion in revenue this year. The playing field is not level because of Googles conduct, and Googles quality reflects the ill-gotten gains of an advantage illegally acquired, the Justice Department asserted in its recommendations. The remedy must close this gap and deprive Google of these advantages.

The playing field is not level because of Googles conduct, and Googles quality reflects the ill-gotten gains of an advantage illegally acquired, the Justice Department asserted in its recommendations. The remedy must close this gap and deprive Google of these advantages. Gaetz faces a tough confirmation hearing. This latest filing gave Kanter and his team a final chance to spell out measures that they believe are needed to restore competition in search. It comes six weeks after Justice first floated the idea of a breakup in a preliminary outline of potential penalties. But Kanters proposal is already raising questions about whether regulators seek to impose controls that extend beyond the issues covered in last years trial, and  by extension  Mehtas ruling. Banning the default search deals that Google now pays more than 26 billion annually to maintain was one of the main practices that troubled Mehta in his ruling. Its less clear whether the judge will embrace the Justice Departments contention that Chrome needs to be spun out of Google and or Android should be completely walled off from its search engine. It is probably going a little beyond, Syracuse University law professor Shubha Ghosh said of the Chrome breakup. The remedies should match the harm, it should match the transgression. This does seem a little beyond that pale. Google rival DuckDuckGo, whose executives testified during last years trial, asserted the Justice Department is simply doing what needs to be done to rein in a brazen monopolist. Undoing Googles overlapping and widespread illegal conduct over more than a decade requires more than contract restrictions: it requires a range of remedies to create enduring competition, Kamyl Bazbaz, DuckDuckGos senior vice president of public affairs, said in a statement. Trying to break up Google harks back to a similar punishment initially imposed on Microsoft a quarter century ago following another major antitrust trial that culminated in a federal judge deciding the software maker had illegally used his Windows operating system for PCs to stifle competition. However, an appeals court overturned an order that would have broken up Microsoft, a precedent many experts believe will make Mehta reluctant to go down a similar road with the Google case.

        "date": "November 21, 2024 03:47 pm",
        "content": "A piece of conceptual art consisting of a simple banana, duct-taped to a wall, sold for 6.2 million at an auction in New York on Wednesday, with the winning bid coming from a prominent cryptocurrency entrepreneur. Comedian, by Italian artist Maurizio Cattelan, was a phenomenon when it debuted in 2019 at Art Basel Miami Beach, as festivalgoers tried to make out whether the single yellow piece of fruit affixed to a white wall with silver duct tape was a joke or cheeky commentary on questionable standards among art collectors. At one point, another artist took the banana off the wall and ate it. The piece attracted so much attention that it had to be withdrawn from view. But three editions sold for between 120,000 and 150,000, according to the gallery handling sales at the time. Five years later, Justin Sun, founder of cryptocurrency platform TRON, has now paid more than 40 times that higher price point at the Sothebys auction. Or, more accurately, Sun purchased a certificate of authenticity that gives him the authority to duct-tape a banana to a wall and call it Comedian. The piece attracted heavy attention at the busy auction at Sothebys, with attendees in the crowded room holding up phones to take photos as two handlers wearing white gloves stood at both sides of the banana. Bidding started at 800,000 and within minutes shot up to 2 million, then 3 million, then 4 million, and higher, as the auctioneer, Oliver Barker, joked Dont let it slip away. Dont miss this opportunity, Barker said. These are words Ive never thought Id say: Five million dollars for a banana. The final hammer price announced in the room was 5.2 million, which didnt include the about 1 million in auction house fees, paid by the buyer. In a statement, Sun said the piece represents a cultural phenomenon that bridges the worlds of art, memes, and the cryptocurrency community. But he said the latest version of Comedian wont last long. Additionally, in the coming days, I will personally eat the banana as part of this unique artistic experience, honoring its place in both art history and popular culture, Sun said. Sothebys calls Cattelan among Contemporary Arts most brilliant provocateurs. He has persistently disrupted the art worlds status quo in meaningful, irreverent, and often controversial ways, the auction house said in a description of Comedian. The sale came a day after a painting by the Belgian surrealist René Magritte sold for 121.2 million, a record for the artist, at a separate auction. The Empire of Light, an eerie nighttime streetscape below a pale blue daytime sky, sold Tuesday as part of Christies sale of the collection of interior designer Mica Ertegun, who died last year at age 97. The sale lifts Magritte into the ranks of artists whose works have gone for more than 100 million at auction. Magritte is the 16th member of the club, which also includes Leonardo da Vinci, Pablo Picasso and Andy Warhol, according to the market analyst firm Artprice. The Empire of Light, executed in 1954, was one of 17 versions of the same scene that Magritte painted in oil. Marc Porter, chairman of Christies Americas, called the sale a historic moment in our saleroom. The 121.2 million price included the auction houses fees. The buyer was a telephone bidder whose identity was not disclosed. Source: AP --Agencies",

The decision came after the elephants long and heavy tusks began affecting its daily activities, forcing it to lift its head to prevent them from dragging on the ground, especially when navigating hills or avoiding obstacles. Veterinarian Warangkana Langkapin said on Thursday (Nov 21) that the team has been talking to experts about the possibility of reducing the weight of the tusks, though any decision will require discussions and approval from several agencies. Warangkana also said that Plai Sak Surins injury on its front left leg, which made movement difficult, was improving with ongoing physical therapy. Plai Sak Surin, commonly known as Muthu Raja within Sri Lanka sustained injuries in Sri Lanka from spending almost two decades participating in religious parades and alleged neglect.

On 06 September 2023, Channel 4 aired a controversial documentary containing startling accusations relating to the bombings on Easter Sunday (April 21) in 2019 which targeted several Catholic churches and luxury hotels in Sri Lanka. The carnage claimed the lives of more than 260 people and left hundreds of others wounded. Channel 4s new Dispatches investigation titled Sri Lankas Easter Bombings is a nearly 50-minute-long videos with serious, yet straightforward allegations about the attacks. It was based on the testimonies of high-placed whistleblowers who alleged that senior governmental officials were complicit in this heinous act. The main whistleblower Hanzeer Azad Maulana was a spokesman for LTTEs breakaway group Tamil Makkal Viduthalai Pullikal (TMVP) led by former MP Sivanesathurai Chandrakanthan alias Pillayan. During a press conference on November 11, Police Media Spokesman DIG Nihal Thalduwa said that the CID has launched a probe into the relevant incident as per a complaint lodged by an organization with the Ministry of Public Security against the statement made by Azad Maulana to Channel 4 on the 2019 Easter Sunday terror attacks. As part of the investigation, the former Chief Minister of the Eastern Province was summoned by the CID on November 12 to provide a statement regarding the allegations in the documentary. However, Pilleyan did not arrive at the CID on the scheduled date instead requested a new date to provide his statement through his attorneys. He was then informed to appear at the CID on November 20 and Pilleyan had arrived at the CID at around 9.30 a.m. He had left after around 5 hours after recording his statement, Ada Derana reporter said.",

        "date": "November 22, 2024 11:58 am",
        "content": "Solo travellers are getting older and are increasingly drawn to Asian destinations  with Sri Lanka securing the most popular spot for 2025, says new data from Flash Pack. Flash Packs latest trends report reveals Sri Lanka has claimed the top spot for solo travel in 2025, advancing from fourth place in 2024. The appeal is clear, says Flash Pack: Sri Lanka packs in all the punch of India  only on a smaller, more accessible scale, and delivered at a much slower pace. The company highlights diverse experiences from incense-swirled cities, buzzing with tuk tuks to misty highlands steeped in tea plantations and dramatic coastlines. But where Sri Lanka really comes into its own, the company adds, is its easy-going balance of beaches, spoiling hotels and restorative, delicately spiced food. The data also shows that the average age of Flash Packs solo travellers has increased from 36 to 39 since the pandemic, reflecting a maturing market for independent adventure tourism. This shift coincides with a boom in social travel  a trend that fostered over 160,000 new friendships, including 50,000 in 2024 alone. Asia dominates the solo travel landscape, securing five of the top ten most popular destinations for 2025. Following Sri Lanka in the rankings are Bali and Mexico, highlighting a diverse mix of cultural experiences sought by modern travellers. Holiday period bookings have seen remarkable growth, with Easter reservations up 70 and Christmas bookings doubling, suggesting a strong appetite for festive season adventures. Lee Thompson, Flash Packs co-founder and CMO, provided the analysis based on internal booking data and industry insights, painting a picture of an evolving solo travel market increasingly focused on social connections and Asian experiences.

        "title": "Reducing sovereign stresses will support Sri Lankan banks credit profiles - Fitch",
        "date": "November 22, 2024 12:36 pm",
        "content": "Sri Lankan banks operating environment (OE) assessment and overall credit profiles will be supported by any improvement in the sovereigns credit profile (Long-Term Foreign-Currency IDR: RD, Long-Term Local-Currency IDR: CCC-) following a completed debt restructuring, says Fitch Ratings. This is due to the strong link between sovereign financial health and banks operating conditions. We believe this would be positive for the National Ratings of Fitch-rated large Sri Lankan banks  albeit based on their creditworthiness relative to other Sri Lankan issuers, the rating agency said. Sri Lankan banks current OE score of ccc-stable is linked closely to the sovereigns local-currency credit profile, given their predominant exposure to the domestic economy and government securities (local-currency treasury instruments: 33.4 of assets and foreign currency instruments: 3.4 at end-1H24) and lending to the broader public sector. The sovereign exposure tends to be higher among the large banks, and state-owned enterprise (SOE) exposure is primarily at the two state-owned D-SIBs. We expect an improvement in Sri Lankas credit profile to alleviate sovereign-related pressures on the banks, which is likely to be credit positive in terms of our financial and non-financial assessments. As per Fitchs National Scale Rating Criteria, the starting point to derive a national rating is an assessment of the issuers credit quality on the international rating scale, which may be reassessed following a sovereign rating change. In such instances, Fitch will update the national ratings of affected local issuers to reflect changes in relative rankings following the sovereign rating change. Fitch last recalibrated the agencys Sri Lankan national rating scale on 12 January 2023 to reflect changes in the relative creditworthiness among Sri Lankan issuers following the downgrade of the sovereigns Long-Term Local-Currency IDR to CC from CCC. The ratings of locally incorporated banks, excluding Cargills Bank PLC (A(lka)Negative) which is driven by our expectation of extraordinary shareholder support, are based on their standalone credit profiles. We do not factor support into the ratings on the two state-owned D-SIBs, despite their strong state linkages, given the sovereigns constrained ability to provide extraordinary support. However, a sustained improvement in the sovereigns financial flexibility may lead to a reconsideration of state support, the statement said. Sri Lanka is close to completing its foreign-currency debt restructuring. A successful outcome, in line with the proposed framework for local bondholders, would be likely to significantly reduce the challenges faced by banks, improving their financial profiles, Fitch Ratings said. Pressures on foreign- and local-currency funding and liquidity have eased considerably due to better external sector flows and the banks efforts to preserve liquidity. We expect banks to regain access to foreign-currency wholesale funding, following the restoration of the sovereigns creditworthiness. Source: Fitch Ratings --Agencies",

He made these remarks today (22) while speaking to reporters as he arrived to provide a statement to the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) regarding the relevant incident. On November 12, the Maligakanda Magistrates Court had ordered to record statements from 18 then-Cabinet Ministers pertaining to the alleged importation of substandard human immunoglobulin vials. The Attorney Generals Department had informed the court that statements are required to be obtained from 18 individuals including former President Ranil Wickremesinghe, former Prime Minister Dinesh Gunawardena, former Ministers Tiran Alles, Mahinda Amaraweera, Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe, Harin Fernando, Roshan Ranasinghe and Nimal Siripala, who were members of the Cabinet which approved the Cabinet paper presented by then Health Minister Keheliya Rambukwella for the import of the controversial drugs in question. Apart from Harin Fernando, the rest of the former ministers had appeared at the CID yesterday (21) to provide their statements, with Fernando arriving today (22) to record his statement. In response to an inquiry regarding whether he believed the then-Cabinet was responsible for the incident involving the controversial medicine procurement, Fernando stated: I dont believe so, because at least 60 to 70 papers are submitted to the Cabinet each day. Usually, the secretaries of the respective ministries prepare these papers and submit them, and the minister then presents them to the Cabinet. Once submitted, the Ministry of Finance makes its recommendations. This is the normal process. This has never occurred in Sri Lankas history.

        "content": "Valery Zaluzhny, former military Commander-in-Chief of Ukraine, believes World War III is underway, adding the direct involvement of Russian allies in the conflict indicates the same. I absolutely believe that in 2024 we can believe that the Third World War has begun, Mr Zaluzhny said during a speech at the Ukrainska Pravdas UP100 award ceremony. Now serving as Ukraines envoy to the United Kingdom, Mr Zaluzhny pointed to the direct involvement of Russias autocratic allies as a significant factor in the wars global expansion. Soldiers from North Korea are standing in front of Ukraine. Lets be honest. Already in Ukraine, the Iranian Shahedis are killing civilians absolutely openly, without any shame, he continued, stressing North Korean troops and Chinese weapons were now actively contributing to the war. Mr Zaluzhny urged Ukraines allies to take decisive action and prevent the conflict from spreading beyond the countrys borders. It is still possible to stop it here, on the territory of Ukraine. But for some reason, our partners do not want to understand this. It is obvious that Ukraine already has too many enemies, he warned. His comments came amid heightened tensions, with Moscow reportedly deploying over 10,000 North Korean troops to the Kursk region and utilising Iranian drones and other advanced weaponry against Ukraine. Ukraine will survive with technology, but it is not clear whether it can win this battle alone, Mr Zaluzhny said. His speech also coincided with Russias use of a hypersonic ballistic missile in Dnipro, an attack that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky condemned as a severe escalation. This is a clear and severe escalation in the scale and brutality of this war, Mr Zelensky said. Valery Zaluzhny has remained a significant voice in Ukraines military and political discourse despite his dismissal earlier this year. Once celebrated for stopping Russias initial invasion in February 2022, tensions with President Zelensky led to his ousting. General Oleksandr Syrskyi replaced him, reportedly for his closer alignment with Mr Zelenskys strategies. Source: NDTV --Agencies",

        "title": "6 tourists died in Laos after apparently drinking methanol",
        "date": "November 23, 2024 10:02 am",
        "content": "Two Australian teenagers and a British woman died from suspected methanol poisoning after drinking tainted alcohol in Laos. An American man and two Danes also died, though their exact causes of death have not been released. A New Zealander also has been sickened. The U.S. State Department issued a warning to travelers to be alert to the potential risk of methanol poisoning. But what is methanol, and how do you avoid it? What is methanol? There are three main types of alcohol: ethanol, methanol and isopropyl. Ethanol is what is found in consumer spirits and is the only one intended for consumption. Isopropanol is the main ingredient in rubbing alcohol and hand sanitizers. Methanol, commonly called wood alcohol because it is the byproduct of wood distillation, is frequently used as fuel and in products such as antifreeze and solvents. What happens if you consume methanol? According to the Methanol Institute, the global trade association for the industry, drinking just 25 to 90 ml (0.7 to 3.0 ounces) of methanol can be fatal without proper medical treatment, but can be successfully treated if caught early. Methanol poisoning can cause headaches, dizziness and decreased consciousness including coma, seizure, nausea, vomiting, blurred vision and multiple other symptoms, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control. The CDC recommends seeking medical attention immediately if methanol poisoning is suspected. Individuals vary in their response to methanol, said toxicologist Alastair Hay from Britains University of Leeds. Some will be able to tolerate more than others because we all have variability in the capacity of our enzymes to detox. But small quantities ... might be fatal for individuals; others may survive slightly more. Why would it be in drinks if its not meant for consumption? Methanol is sometimes added deliberately by unscrupulous bars to mixed drinks to give them more kick and to save money on using higher-priced ethanol-based spirits such as vodka or rum. This practice is not specific to Laos or Southeast Asia, but occurs wherever taxes on legitimate alcohol or the cost of legitimate alcohol is perceived as being too high, according to the Methanol Institute. Methanol is also a normal product of the distillation process that produces ethanol, and in home-brew distilleries without strict controls  often found in poorer countries  it can end up in the mix. How do you avoid methanol poisoning? The answer is easy: dont drink it. But its colorless, odorless and tasteless, so that can be something of a challenge. In guidance issued after the Laos poisonings, Britains Foreign Office recommends only purchasing alcoholic beverages from licensed liquor stores, buying drinks only from licensed bars and hotels, always checking if bottle seals are intact, and checking labels for poor print quality or incorrect spellings. The Methanol Institute notes that beverages such as canned beer, cider, wine, pre-mix, and duty-free products tend to be safer and less easy to adulterate. It also urges people to be wary of homemade brews, and free drinks or drinks priced far below normal. Source: AP --Agencies",

        "title": "IMF reaches staff-level agreement on third review of Sri Lankas EFF",
        "date": "November 23, 2024 11:29 am",
        "content": "IMF staff and the Sri Lankan authorities have reached staff-level agreement on economic policies to conclude the third review of Sri Lankas economic reform program supported by the IMFs Extended Fund Facility (EFF). Once the review is approved by IMF Management and completed by the IMF Executive Board, Sri Lanka will have access to about US333 million in financing, a statement said. The new governments commitment to the program objectives has enhanced confidence and ensures policy continuity, it said, adding that sustaining the reform momentum is critical to safeguarding the hard-won gains under the program thus far and putting the economy on a path towards durable recovery and stable and inclusive growth. The IMFs Executive Board will consider completion of the review based on the implementation by the authorities of prior actions; and the completion of financing assurances review, confirming multilateral partners financing contributions and assessing adequate progress with debt restructuring, the statement added. An International Monetary Fund (MF) team led by Peter Breuer, Senior Mission Chief for Sri Lanka, visited Colombo from November 17 to 23, 2024. After constructive discussions in Colombo, Mr. Breuer and Deputy Mission Chief Ms. Katsiaryna Svirydzenka issued the following statement: We are pleased to announce that the IMF team reached staff-level agreement with the Sri Lankan authorities on the third review under the 4-year Extended Fund Facility (EFF) arrangement. The arrangement was approved by the IMF Executive Board for a total amount of SDR 2.3 billion (about US3 billion) on March 20, 2023. The staff-level agreement is subject to the approval by IMF management and the IMF Executive Board, contingent on: (i) the implementation by the authorities of prior actions including the submission of a 2025 budget consistent with program objectives; and (ii) the completion of financing assurances review, which will focus on confirming multilateral partners committed financing contributions and whether adequate progress has been made with the debt restructuring to give confidence that the restructuring will be concluded in a timely manner and in line with the programs debt targets. Upon completion of the Executive Board review, Sri Lanka would have access to SDR 254 million (about US333 million), bringing the total IMF financial support disbursed under the arrangement to SDR 1,016 million (about US1,333 million). Sri Lankas ambitious reform agenda supported by the EFF is delivering commendable outcomes. The economy expanded on average by 4 percent y-o-y in the four quarters ending in June 2024. High-frequency indicators point to continued expansion across all sectors. Average headline and core inflation remained contained at 0.8 and 3.8 percent during the third quarter. Gross official reserves increased to US6.4 billion at end-October 2024 with sizeable foreign exchange purchases by the Central Bank. Public finances have strengthened following substantial fiscal reforms. Program performance was strong, with all quantitative performance criteria and indicative targets (IT) for end-June 2024 met, as well as the ITs for end-September 2024, except for the IT on social spending. Most structural benchmarks due before October-2024 were either met or implemented with delay; some benchmarks are delayed because of the election cycle. The new governments commitment to the program objectives has enhanced confidence and ensures policy continuity. Sustaining the reform momentum is critical to safeguarding the hard-won gains of the program and putting the economy on a path towards lasting recovery and stable and inclusive growth. Since the crisis has affected Sri Lankas entire population, it will be important to ensure that the benefits from economic growth are shared appropriately. Maintaining macroeconomic stability and restoring debt sustainability are key to securing Sri Lankas prosperity and require persevering with responsible fiscal policy. Continued revenue mobilization efforts and spending restraint are needed to prepare the 2025 budget in line with program parameters. Revenue administration reforms and efforts to improve tax compliance will help to ensure that the burden stemming from the crisis is shared proportionately to taxpayers ability to contribute. Avoiding new tax exemptions will help reduce fiscal revenue leakages, corruption risks and build much needed fiscal buffers, including for social spending and to support Sri Lankas most vulnerable. Maintaining cost recovery in fuel and electricity pricing and resolving legacy debts will help minimize fiscal risks arising from state-owned enterprises. The government has an important responsibility to protect the poor and vulnerable at this difficult time. It is important to redouble efforts to meet the programs minimum spending target on social spending and to improve targeting, adequacy, and coverage of social safety nets, particularly Aswesuma. While inflation has decelerated faster than expected, continued monitoring is warranted to ensure sustained price stability and support macroeconomic stability. Against ongoing global uncertainty, it remains important to continue rebuilding external buffers through strong reserves accumulation. Sri Lankas recent Agreement in Principle with bondholders is an important milestone putting Sri Lankas debt on a path towards sustainability. The critical next steps are to complete the commercial debt restructuring, finalize bilateral agreements with official creditors along the lines of the accord with the Official Creditor Committee and implement the terms of the other agreements. This will help restore Sri Lankas debt sustainability. The new governments mandate will reinvigorate governance reforms addressing corruption risks, rebuilding economic confidence, and making growth more robust and inclusive. The IMF team held meetings with His Excellency President and Finance Minister Anura Kumara Dissanayake, Honorable Labor Minister and Deputy Minister of Economic Development Prof. Anil Jayantha Fernando, Honorable Deputy Minister of Finance and Planning Dr. Harshana Suriyapperuma, Senior Economic Advisor Duminda Hulangamuwa, Central Bank of Sri Lanka Governor Dr. P. Nandalal Weerasinghe, Secretary to the Treasury Mr. K M Mahinda Siriwardana, and other senior government and CBSL officials. The team also met with Parliamentarians, representatives from the private sector, civil society organizations, and development partners.

The 24 year-old victim, Kayilanathan Sinthujan, was a resident of Kantharmadam, Jaffna and has passed away today (23) while receiving treatment at the University Hospital KDU (UHKDU). A former student of Jaffna Hindu College, he had sat for the G.C.E. Advanced Level (AL) examination under the stream of Physical Science (Maths). The incident on November 01 had claimed the lives of two individuals and injured 39 others when a bus carrying over 40 passengers toppled on Dunhinda Road in Badulla. Among the deceased were two female students of the Southern Campus of the General Sir John Kotelawala Defence University (KDU). The students had been traveling on a field trip when the bus hit a curb and overturned. Post-mortem examinations later revealed that both female students, aged 23, died due to severe head injuries. One victim, Isuri Umayangana, was a resident of Pahalakanda, Tholangamuwa in Nivithigala, while the other, N.M.P.T. Hettimulla, hailed from Unakolagedara, Kurunegala. According to reports, the accident occurred around 7:45 a.m. on November 01 near the third and fourth-kilometer markers on the Badulla-Mahiyanganaya main road, close to the Dunhinda access road. Police suspect the bus may have collided with an embankment due to a brake failure, although investigations are ongoing. The group traveling on the ill-fated bus included 41 individualstwo army personnel, five instructors, and students. They were on their way to a field inspection after staying at the Uva Management Development Institute. It had been revealed before the court on November 05 that the bus driver involved in the recent fatal bus accident previously had his driving license suspended for 05 months after being arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol. He had previously been arrested on August 04 by police in the Labuduwa area of Galle, within the Akmeemana police jurisdiction, after causing an accident involving the bus he was driving and a motorcycle. The details of the incident were presented Nov 5 in a motion by the Akmeemana Police to the Galle Additional Magistrates Court.

        "content": "Jonathan Majors  ex-girlfriend has dropped her assault and defamation lawsuit against the once-rising Hollywood star after reaching a settlement. Lawyers for Majors and Grace Jabbari agreed to dismiss the case with prejudice, according to a joint filing in Manhattan federal court Thursday. Jabbaris lawyer said Friday that the suit was favorably settled but declined to elaborate. Grace Jabbari has exhibited tremendous courage throughout this very long and difficult process, attorney Brittany Henderson said in a statement. We hope that she can finally put this chapter behind her and move forward with her head held high. Representatives for Majors didnt respond to emails seeking comment Friday. Jabbari, in her lawsuit filed in March, accused the 35-year-old Marvel and Creed III star of subjecting her to escalating incidents of physical and verbal abuse during their relationship, including assault, battery, defamation and infliction of emotional distress. The British dancer filed the suit months after Majors was convicted of misdemeanor assault and harassment in connection with an altercation in Manhattan. During a fight that began in the backseat of a chauffeured car before spilling out into the streets, Jabbari said Majors hit her head with his open hand, twisted her arm behind her back and squeezed her middle finger until it fractured. Majors claimed Jabbari had flown into a jealous rage and was the aggressor and that he was only trying to regain his phone and get away safely. Majors avoided jail time but was ordered by a judge in April to complete a yearlong counseling program. Following the guilty verdict, Majors was immediately dropped by Marvel Studios, which had cast him as Kang the Conqueror, a role envisioned as the main villain in the entertainment empires movies and television shows for years to come. Majors and Jabbari had met in 2021 on the set of Marvels Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania in which Majors played Kang and Jabbari served as a movement coach. Majors has slowly reemerged on the Hollywood scene in recent weeks. His long-shelved film Magazine Dreams was acquired for theatrical release last month. The bodybuilder drama had garnered early Oscar buzz for Majors, but was dropped by its distributors following his conviction last December. Then earlier this month, Majors and fellow actor Meagan Good announced their engagement at the Ebony Power 100 Gala in Los Angeles. Source: AP --Agencies",

        "date": "November 23, 2024 05:00 pm",
        "content": "Sri Lankas new government has agreed to press ahead with a IMF bailout programme that involves tough austerity and economic reforms, the international lender announced on Saturday (Nov 23). The International Monetary Fund said it reached an agreement with President Anura Kumara Dissanayakes administration to continue with the four-year loan negotiated by his predecessor last year. The authorities have committed to stay within the guardrails of the programme, IMF team leader Peter Breuer told reporters at the end of talks with the new government. He said the new governments commitment ensured policy continuity. Sustaining the reform momentum is critical to safeguarding the hard-won gains of the programme, and putting the economy on a path towards lasting recovery and stable and inclusive growth, Breuer added. Sri Lanka went to the IMF for a rescue package after the country defaulted on its US46 billion external debt in April 2022 during an unprecedented economic meltdown. The shortage of foreign exchange, which left the country unable to finance even the most essential imports of food and fuel, led to months of street protests and forced then-president Gotabaya Rajapaksa to resign. The US2.9 billion loan secured early last year required Colombo to sharply raise taxes, remove generous energy subsidies and agree to restructure more than 50 loss-making state enterprises. Dissanayakes predecessor Ranil Wickremesinghe secured the rescue that involves the disbursement of a US2.9 billion loan over four years. In his first address to parliament, after his National Peoples Power party won a landslide at the Nov 14 election, Dissanayake backed the IMF deal on Thursday. The dissatisfaction with traditional politicians held responsible for the economic collapse was a key driver of Dissanayakes electoral success. Dissanayake said there was no room to make any mistakes in managing the economy. According to Breuer, the new governments pledge to fight corruption will reinvigorate governance reforms, rebuild economic confidence, and make growth more robust and inclusive. Sri Lanka will now be able to draw down US333 million, subject to IMF board approval, by the end of the year. Source: AFP --Agencies",

        "date": "November 23, 2024 07:29 pm",
        "content": "Sri Lanka should be vigilant about the Adani power project in the island, experts said, after Federal prosecutors in New York indicted Group Chairman Gautam Adani and seven others on multiple counts of fraud. Sri Lanka has often seen cases of significant corruption in the country being exposed in other jurisdictions, according to Nishan De Mel, Executive Director of Verité Research, a Colombo-based think tank. He referred to the allegations of bribery in Sri Lankan Airlines purchase of aircraft from Airbus, which surfaced in a United Kingdom-based investigation a few years ago, and to the Pandora Papers that threw up names of local politicians and businessmen. It is very important for Sri Lanka to redouble its efforts against corruption, to ensure that we are protected from corrupt deals, he told The Hindu. After news on the alleged bribery scheme of the Adani Group surfaced on Thursday, many citizens and activists in Sri Lanka took to social media and called for greater scrutiny of the Groups power project on the island. President Anura Kumara Dissanayake, who won the Presidency this September, and his National Peoples Power NPP alliance, which secured a historic, two-thirds majority in the November 14 general election, have pledged to root out corruption. Days before his election win, Mr. Dissanayake vowed to cancel the corrupt Adani deal if his government came to power. Subsequently, Foreign Minister and Cabinet spokesperson of the interim administration said the government would review the project after the Parliamentary polls. The International Monetary Fund, too, in its ongoing programme with Sri Lanka, has underscored the need to arrest corruption vulnerabilities. Controversial deal Adani Green Energy is investing 442 million in a wind power project in Mannar and Pooneryn in northern Sri Lanka. From the time the former Gotabaya Rajapaksa government roped in the firm in 2022, the project has remained controversial. The main political opposition accused the conglomerate of backdoor entry, in the absence of an open call for tenders. The same year, a top Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) official told a Parliamentary panel that the project was given to the Adani Group after Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi pressured President Gotabaya Rajapaksa. The official subsequently resigned, after withdrawing his original statement. Regardless, the Ranil Wickremesinghe administration went ahead with the project, amid questions from corruption watchdogs. When the Adani Group came under the global spotlight in early 2023, and its stocks plummeted in the wake of U.S. short seller Hindenburg accusing it of pulling the largest con in corporate history, then Foreign Minister of Sri Lanka Ali Sabry said the Wickremesinghe administration was very, very confident of the future of the project, which it saw as a government-to-government deal with India. Earlier this year, environmentalists and Mannar residents moved Sri Lankas Supreme Court, challenging the project on grounds of potential environmental impact and lack of transparency. The case was taken up by a five-member Bench and the next hearing is scheduled on March 18 and 19, 2025, according to sources familiar with the proceedings. The renewable energy project is one of two projects that the Adani Group is executing in Sri Lanka. Its other major investment is the Adani Ports-led container terminal project in Colombo. In November 2023, the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) announced a 553-million investment in the project, a 700-million joint venture among Adani Ports, Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA), and Sri Lankan conglomerate John Keells Holdings.

        "date": "November 23, 2024 10:18 pm",
        "content": "Former Sri Lankan President Ranil Wickremesinghe said his successor Anura Kumara Dissanayake should fully implement the vision document adopted with India last year. President Dissanayake, elected to the top office in September this year, is scheduled to visit India in mid-December. During his India trip in July 2023, then-President Wickremesinghe had signed a vision document with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, outlining areas of cooperation between the two countries, especially economic partnership. In the vision document signed by me and Prime Minister of India Narendra Modi, we have set out the areas of bilateral cooperation between the two countries. I am of the opinion he (Dissanayake) should move forward and we should implement this vision document in its entirety, he told PTI. Wickremesinghe, who attended an event at the Sri Sathya Sai Vidya Vihar school in Indore, was replying when asked what should be the areas of mutual cooperation when Dissanayake visits New Delhi next month and meets PM Modi and other Indian leaders. The vision document adopted during Wickremesinghes tour emphasised on strengthening maritime, air, energy ties and people-to-people connectivity between India and Sri Lanka. It also envisaged accelerating mutual cooperation in tourism, power, trade, higher education and skill development. Earlier, Wickremesinghe inaugurated a sports complex at the Sri Sathya Sai Vidya Vihar and later addressed the audience on the topic Common Heritage: India and the Indian Ocean. Referring to Indias assistance during Sri Lankas unprecedented economic crisis, he said his country has benefited from this legacy during the most difficult period in its history. Wickremesinghe, who has also served as prime minister of the island nation, thanked PM Modi and Indian Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman for the financial assistance. Citing different examples at the school gathering, Wickremesinghe maintained India and Sri Lanka have had religious, trade, linguistic and cultural relations since ancient times.

        "date": "November 24, 2024 09:10 am",
        "content": "Thanjavur Police on Friday arrested three persons for an attempt to smuggle ganja to Sri Lanka from Andhra Pradesh via Thanjavur in India. Three FRP boats that were used for transporting the contraband and 330 kg of ganja were seized. Sources said the Thanjavur SP Ashish Rawat received information that a huge quantity of ganja was being smuggled in a lorry from Andhra Pradesh to Sethubavachatram in Thanjavur to be transported to Sri Lanka. The SP immediately formed a special team and ordered a vehicle inspection. A special team headed by Sub Inspector Devid was camping in Sethubavachatram. The police during a patrol on Friday early hours found a lorry parked suspiciously and three persons loading bundles into a car from the lorry. The police team surrounded the trio and searched the lorry. They found bundles of ganja weighing 330 kg. The police identified the three persons as Paramaraj (34), the lorry driver from Tenkasi, Annadurai (44), from Peravurani, and Muthaiyya (60), from Ammachathiram in Thanjavur. Further investigation revealed that Karuppiah (52), from Vilar Road in Thanjavur, purchased a huge quantity of ganja from Vizag in Andhra Pradesh and was planning to smuggle it to Sri Lanka by sea from Sethubavachatram in Thanjavur using FRP boats owned by his friend Annadurai. According to their plan, they used a lorry with an altered number plate carrying the Karnataka number to cross the Andhra Pradesh border. When they entered Tamil Nadu, they changed it to a Tamil Nadu number plate and reached Sethubavachatram. Subsequently, the special team arrested Paramaraj, Annadurai and Muthaiyya and seized 330 kg of ganja bundles, the car, the lorry and the boats used for the smuggling. A search is on for Karuppiah.

        "title": "Developing nations blast 300 billion COP29 climate deal as insufficient",
        "date": "November 24, 2024 10:28 am",
        "content": "Countries at the COP29 summit in Baku adopted a 300 billion a year global finance target on Sunday to help poorer nations cope with impacts of climate change, a deal its intended recipients criticised as woefully insufficient. The agreement, clinched in overtime at the two-week conference in Azerbaijans capital, was meant to provide momentum for international efforts to curb global warming in a year destined to be the hottest on record. Some delegates gave the deal a standing ovation in the COP29 plenary hall. Others lambasted wealthy nations for not doing more and criticised the Azerbaijan host for hurriedly gavelling through the contentious plan. I regret to say that this document is nothing more than an optical illusion, Indian delegation representative Chandni Raina told the closing session of the summit, minutes after the deal was gavelled in. This, in our opinion, will not address the enormity of the challenge we all face. Therefore, we oppose the adoption of this document. United Nations climate chief Simon Stiell acknowledged the difficult negotiations that led to the agreement but hailed the outcome as an insurance policy for humanity against global warming. It has been a difficult journey, but weve delivered a deal, Stiell said. This deal will keep the clean energy boom growing and protect billions of lives. But like any insurance policy, it only works if the premiums are paid in full, and on time. The agreement would provide 300 billion annually by 2035, boosting rich countries previous commitment to provide 100 billion per year in climate finance by 2020. That earlier goal was met two years late, in 2022, and expires in 2025. The deal also lays the groundwork for next years climate summit, to be held in the Amazon rainforest of Brazil, where countries are meant to map out the next decade of climate action. The summit cut to the heart of the debate over financial responsibility of industrialised countries - whose historic use of fossil fuels has caused the bulk of greenhouse gas emissions - to compensate others for worsening damage from climate change. It also laid bare divisions between wealthy governments constrained by tight domestic budgets and developing nations reeling from costs of storms, floods and droughts. Negotiations had been due to finish on Friday but ran into overtime as representatives from nearly 200 countries struggled to reach consensus. Talks were interrupted on Saturday as some developing countries and island nations walked away in frustration. We are leaving with a small portion of the funding climate-vulnerable countries urgently need. It isnt nearly enough, but its a start, said Tina Stege, Marshall Islands climate envoy. Nations have been seeking financing to deliver on the Paris Agreement goal of limiting global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels - beyond which catastrophic climate impacts could occur. The world is currently on track for as much as 3.1 C (5.6 F) of warming by the end of this century, according to the 2024 U.N. Emissions Gap report, with global greenhouse gas emissions and fossil fuels use continuing to rise. Sundays deal failed to set out detailed steps for how countries will act on last years U.N. climate summit pledge to transition away from fossil fuels and triple renewable energy capacity this decade. Some negotiators said Saudi Arabia had attempted to block such a plan during the talks. Theres definitely a challenge in getting greater ambition when youre negotiating with the Saudis, said U.S. climate adviser John Podesta. A Saudi official did not immediately provide comment. What Counts as Developed Nation? The roster of countries required to contribute - about two dozen industrialised countries, including the U.S., European nations and Canada - dates back to a list decided during U.N. climate talks in 1992. European governments have demanded others pay in, including China, the worlds second-biggest economy, and oil-rich Gulf states. The deal encourages developing countries to make contributions but does not require them. The agreement includes a broader goal of raising 1.3 trillion in climate finance annually by 2035 - which would include funding from all public and private sources and which economists say matches the sum needed to address global warming. Countries also agreed on rules for a global market to buy and sell carbon credits that proponents say could mobilise billions more dollars into new projects to fight global warming, from reforestation to deployment of clean energy technologies. Securing the climate finance deal was a challenge from the start. Donald Trumps U.S. presidential election victory this month has raised doubts among some negotiators that the worlds largest economy would pay into any climate finance goal agreed in Baku. Trump, a Republican who takes office in January, has called climate change a hoax and promised to again remove the U.S. from international climate cooperation. President Joe Biden congratulated the COP29 participants for reaching what he called an historic agreement that would help mobilise needed funds, but said more work was needed. While there is still substantial work ahead of us to achieve our climate goals, todays outcome puts us one significant step closer. On behalf of the American people and future generations, we must continue to accelerate our work to keep a cleaner, safer, healthier planet within our grasp, Biden said in a statement. Western governments have seen global warming slip down the list of national priorities amid surging geopolitical tensions, including Russias war in Ukraine and expanding conflict in the Middle East, and rising inflation. The showdown over financing for developing countries comes in a year scientists predict will be the hottest on record. Climate woes are stacking up, with widespread flooding killing thousands across Africa, deadly landslides burying villages in Asia, and drought in South America shrinking rivers. Developed countries have not been spared. Torrential rain triggered floods in Valencia, Spain, last month that left more than 200 dead, and the U.S. so far this year has registered 24 billion-dollar disasters - just four fewer than last year.

        "date": "November 24, 2024 12:58 pm",
        "content": "Aiming to cash on growing outbound Indian tourists, Sri Lanka and Australia have launched new initiatives to cash in on this. Sri Lankan Airlines has launched a unique package for Indian tourists- the Ramayana Trail that includes 50 significant locations in the country which is associated with the Hindu epic. These include Seeta Amman Temple, where Mata Sita is said to have prayed during her captivity, to Rumassala hill, where a piece of the Himalayas is believed to have landed, dropped by Hanuman. Launching the trail officially over the weekend in Delhi, the Sri Lankan high commissioner said, The Ramayan is not merely a story, it is a tapestry encapsulating culture, spirituality, and heritage. It has been a source of inspiration, guidance, fostering a connection between India  Sri Lanka...Sri Lankan Airlines is not only offering the opportunity to discover significant locations Sri Lankan Airlines is the countrys national carrier, and the initiative comes at a time when Indias Unified Payments Interface (UPI) was extended to the country, which enhances digital financial connectivity. It not only facilitates cross-border transactions, and digital connectivity but also helps the Indian tourists travelling to the country. Chief Executive Officer of Sri Lankan Airlines, Richard Nuttall said, Our Gurus came with this wonderful idea, that it was time for the Ramayana trail. We are really proud to promote this concept, bring the trail to India. We hope this will take tourism from India to Sri Lanka to a new level. Indians were the largest group of foreign tourists to travel to Sri Lanka in October 2024. With a share of 26.8, around 36000 Indians travelled to the country also known as the Pearl of the Indian Ocean. The next largest number of tourists were from Russia, at just 7.6 share. From November 1-20th 2024, 26,700 Indian tourists travelled to the country, according to Sri Lankan govt data. The pull exists down under Australia, where Tourism Australia launched a new campaign Howzat for a holiday? to get more Indian tourists coinciding with the Border Gavaskar trophy. With Australian Test cricket captain, Pat Cummins, as the face of the campaign, the aim is to encourage Indian travellers to visit the country. Senator Don Farrell, Australias Minister for Trade and Tourism in a statement said, With tens of millions of people across India tuning in to watch the Test cricket series here in Australia, we have an opportunity to showcase to a huge audience why there is no place like Australia for a holiday. The number of Indian travellers visiting Australia already exceeds 2019 levels and, according to Tourism Research Australia, arrivals from India are forecast to double pre-pandemic levels by 2028. Tourism Australia Managing Director, Phillipa Harrison pointed out, With a population of more than 1.4 billion people and more Indians looking to travel, the potential in the Indian market is endless and we see the Test series as our chance to get on the front foot and promote our country to a captive TV audience. According to a report by the International Trade Administration (ITA), Indian tourists are one of the highest spenders per visit abroad, which contributes to the economies of the countries they visit. The number of Indian travellers is not only increasing in numbers but is expected to overtake Chinese travellers in the coming years. Source: WION --Agencies",

        "date": "November 24, 2024 01:42 pm",
        "content": "Romanians were voting Sunday in the first round of a presidential election amid a surge in inflation and fears over the war in neighbouring Ukraine that could favour far-right leader George Simion. The vote kicks off two weeks of elections in the poor NATO member country, including a parliamentary vote and a December 8 presidential run-off. Social democrat Prime Minister Marcel Ciolacu is leading a field of 13 hopefuls in the polls, with about 25 percent, followed by AUR leader Simion on 15 to 19 percent. Simion is targeting people like Rodica, a 69-year-old who was among the first to vote in Bucharests chilly sunshine. The pensioner, who would not give a family name, was afraid of the Ukraine war and wanted better living conditions and peace. The stakes are high in the race to replace President Klaus Iohannis, a liberal and staunch Ukraine ally, who has held the largely ceremonial post since 2014. Romania, which has a 650-kilometre (400-mile) border with Ukraine, has become more important since Russia invaded its neighbour in 2022. The Black Sea nation now plays a vital strategic role for NATO -- as it is home to more than 5,000 soldiers -- and the transit of Ukrainian grain, the New Strategy Center think tank said. Big Trump fan Simion, 38, is hoping to make a breakthrough as far-right parties across Europe notch up electoral successes. Donald Trumps victory in the US presidential election has further complicated Romanias choice, political analyst Cristian Pirvulescu told AFP. Known for his fiery speeches, Simion -- a Trump fan who sometimes dons a red cap in appreciation of his idol -- hopes to get a boost from his victory. Simion opposes sending military aid to Ukraine, wants a more patriotic Romania and frequently lashes out against what he calls the greedy corrupt bubble in Brussels. Romania has so far only had minions and cowards as leaders, he recently said, adding that people no longer accept to be treated as second-class citizens in other countries. Simion has seen his popularity surge by tapping into voter anger over record inflation -- 10 percent last year and 5.5 predicted for 2024 -- while promising to deliver affordable housing for all. Should he reach the second round, analyst Pirvulescu predicts a contagion effect that would likely boost his AUR party in the December parliamentary election. Romanian democracy is in danger for the first time since the fall of communism in 1989, he added. Russian spies claim Im really afraid well end up with Simion in the second round, 36-year-old IT worker Oana Diaconu told AFP, expressing concern about the far-right leaders unpredictable nature and attacks on the European Union. The campaign has been marked by controversy and personal attacks, with Simion facing accusations of meeting with Russian spies -- a claim he has denied. Ciolacu has been criticised for his use of private jets. Despite low popularity ratings, he hopes to win over voters with his promise of stability for Romania. Ciolacus Social Democratic Party (PSD), which has shaped the countrys politics for more than three decades, currently governs in a coalition with the National Liberal Party. Polling in third place is former journalist Elena Lasconi, who became mayor of the small town of Campulung and head of a centre-right opposition party, who could prove to be a surprise package. Our best hope might be to wake up with Lasconi in the second round -- she seems to be the most honest candidate, said Diaconu before hopping on a Bucharest tram. Polling stations opened at 7:00 am (0500 GMT) and close at 9:00 pm, with exit polls expected shortly after. Source: AFP --Agencies",

        "content": "The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has issued a summons to Indian billionaire Gautam Adani, indicted on U.S. bribery allegations related to a bombshell federal indictment against him, a court filing showed. The SEC is suing the head of the Adani Group and his nephew Sagar Adani, alleging they engaged in hundreds of millions of dollars in bribes to help an Adani company while falsely touting the companys compliance with antibribery principles and laws in connection with a 750 million bond offering. The summons requires an answer within 21 days, according to the filing dated Wednesday in federal court in the Eastern District of New York. The SEC suit seeks unspecified monetary penalties and restrictions on the Adanis from serving as officers of listed companies. Adani Group representatives did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment on Sunday. The group has denied the criminal charges as baseless. The group CFO said the indictment is linked to one contract of Adani Green Energy that makes up some 10 of its business, and that no other firms in the conglomerate were accused of wrongdoing. Federal prosecutors issued arrest warrants for Gautam and Sagar Adani, alleging they participated in a 265 million scheme to bribe Indian officials to secure power-supply deals. Authorities said Adani and seven other defendants, including his nephew Sagar, agreed to bribe Indian government officials to obtain contracts expected to yield 2 billion of profit over 20 years, and develop Indias largest solar power plant project. The crisis is the second in two years to hit the ports-to-power conglomerate founded by Adani, 62, one of the worlds richest people. The fallout was felt immediately, as billions of dollars were wiped off the market value of Adani Group companies and Kenyas president canceled a massive airport project with the group.

        "title": "Wicked, Gladiator II bring in 363 million in global box office",
        "date": "November 25, 2024 11:03 am",
        "content": "The musical adaptation Wicked and action epic Gladiator II racked up a combined US270.2 million (S362.8 million) in global ticket sales over the weekend, a gift to cinemas heading into what may be a record-setting holiday season. The robust box office returns provided reassurance to Hollywood, which has weathered cost-cutting and layoffs amid forecasts of the death of cinema as consumers gravitated to streaming video services. Moviegoers and box office pundits have been waiting for this weekend, and no one is disappointed, said Chris Aronson, president of distribution for Paramount Pictures. Wicked, the first of two Universal Pictures films based on a Broadway prequel to The Wizard of Oz, topped the domestic and global box office. It pulled in US114 million at US and Canadian theatres, plus US50.2 million in international markets, for a global total of US164.2 million. It was the biggest opening weekend for a film based on a Broadway musical, ahead of the global debut of Universals 2012 release Les Miserables, according to the studio. Gladiator II hauled in US106 million around the world, including US55.5 million from domestic sales. The Paramount Pictures film is the sequel to a movie that won the best picture Oscar two decades ago. The film, which was released last weekend outside the US, had an overall box office tally of US221 million. The two films, dubbed Glicked by fans, brought in US169.5 million at domestic theatres, helping lift the weekend box office to US201.9 million. Its the highest-grossing weekend in North America since the July opening of Deadpool  Wolverine, according to Comscore. Glicked fell short of the US245 million Barbie and Oppenheimer opening frenzy in July 2023, which showed that the industry was rebounding from the pandemic and strikes that year by writers and actors. Still, the two films delivered a much-needed jolt to movie theatres, after anticipated fall films such as Joker: Folie a Deux and Venom: The Last Dance underperformed at the box office. The fervour was a positive sign for theatre chains such as AMC Entertainment, Cineplex and Cinemark that are looking ahead to another major release, Walt Disneys animated Moana 2 this week. This is a tremendous catalyst for a strong box office going into December and the New Year, said National Association of Theatre Owners President and CEO Michael OLeary. Movie ticket sales in the US and Canada have hovered below pre-pandemic levels as cinemas grapple with competition from streaming and the disruptions from last years Hollywood strikes. Sundays (Nov 24) tallies brought year-to-date domestic ticket sales to US7.3 billion, down 10.6 per cent from the same time in 2023, according to Comscore. Studios and theatre owners are hopeful that Moana 2 will lead next weekend to the strongest Thanksgiving-period sales in history. Box office analysts say ticket sales from Thanksgiving through the end of the year could rank as the biggest in cinema history. The holiday season record of US2.5 billion was set in 2017, led by the Star Wars film The Last Jedi. This is the best possible news for movie theatres, this lineup of films, starting with Glicked and Moana 2, said Paul Dergarabedian, media analyst for Comscore. Wicked stars Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo in the story of a misunderstood, green-skinned student of magic who becomes the Wicked Witch of the West. Its wrapped in a fairy tale, but the point of it is to dig at real truth, director Jon M. Chu told Reuters at the films premiere in London, when asked about the storys broad appeal. Universal, a unit of Comcast, spent roughly US160 million to make the first Wicked movie, a sum that does not include tens of millions more for marketing ranging from a Super Bowl ad to hundreds of Wicked products. In a campaign reminiscent of the hoopla surrounding Barbie, Wicked tie-ins include pink and green drinks at Starbucks, a fashion line at Target and a Betty Crocker cupcake mix. This campaign was just everywhere. It was just inescapable, said Jim Orr, Universal Pictures president of domestic theatrical distribution. And on top of all of that, we had the hardest-working cast that you could have. From a publicity and from a marketing standpoint, Cynthia and Ariana were literally just everywhere. The second Wicked film is scheduled for release in November 2025. Gladiator II stars Paul Mescal, Pedro Pascal and Denzel Washington in a story of political intrigue that unfolds 16 years after the original film. Other films coming before year-end include Walt Disneys Mufasa: The Lion King, Paramounts Sonic the Hedgehog 3 and Searchlight Pictures A Complete Unknown, starring Timothee Chalamet as musician Bob Dylan.

        "content": "Tech giant Apple has reportedly offered to increase its investment into Indonesia to persuade the government to lift its sales ban on the iPhone 16. The proposal would reportedly see Apple invest almost US100 million into the country, people familiar to the matter said to media. In addition, the US100 million investment would contain a research and development center programme and a professional developer academy too, according to media reports. Febri Hendri Antoni Arif, spokesperson to Indonesias ministry of industry reportedly said that minister Agus Gumiwant Kartasasmita held an internal meeting to discuss the meeting. Of which, it revealed that Apple also planned to produce accessory product components such as the AirPods Max mesh, from July 2025 in Bandung. During the meeting, the ministry considered whether the investment value offered by Apple is fair when compared to other investment destination countries such as Vietnam and India, said Febri. At the same time, the ministry also deliberated on whether the proposal would be fair for other investors in the mobile phone, handheld computer and tablet segments in Indonesia. Earlier in November this year, the Indonesian government said that Apples latest iPhone 16 will not be sold in Indonesia as it does not meet the countrys rules on the use of locally made components. According to the regulations in Indonesia, certain smartphones sold domestically need to contain at least 40 of parts manufactured locally and the iPhone 16 has not met the requirement. Imported iPhone 16 hardwares cannot be marketed in the country, because Apple Indonesia has not fulfilled its investment commitment to earn a local content certification, a spokesperson from the ministry said earlier this month, adding that the phones can still be brought from abroad for personal use. Not long after the move, Indonesian government also said that the Google Pixel smartphones will be banned for failing to meet domestic content requirements for the same reason. Google must obtain local content certification before resuming sales, the Industry Ministry spokesperson said, according to Tech Crunch. He added that the local content rule and related policies are made for fairness for all investors that invest in Indonesia. Source: Marketing Interactive --Agencies",

        "date": "November 25, 2024 12:51 pm",
        "content": "The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has approved a 200 million loan to upgrade Sri Lankas power sector infrastructure, enhancing the reliability of transmission and distribution networks and facilitating greater integration of renewable energy. Driving power sector reforms, combined with targeted infrastructure interventions, is essential to facilitate competitive renewable energy development and reduce power generation costs, said ADB Country Director for Sri Lanka Takafumi Kadono. By expanding and modernizing infrastructure and incorporating digitalization solutions, this project will support the governments goal of increased integration of renewable energy in the electricity mix, reduce power interruptions, and minimize transmission and distribution losses. Sri Lanka achieved 100 household electrification in 2016. Peak demand reached around 2,800 megawatts (MW) in 2023, including contributions from distributed renewable energy, and is projected to grow significantly by 2030. While Sri Lankas total installed power generation capacity reached 5,191 MW in 2023, about 50 of the countrys electricity generation in 2023 came from thermal power plants, underscoring the challenges in transitioning to a more sustainable energy mix. In its updated nationally determined contribution, the government has set an ambitious target of 70 electricity generation from renewables by 2030 and carbon neutrality in electricity generation by 2050. The Power System Strengthening and Renewable Energy Integration Project will enhance climate resilience and expand the capacity of transmission and distribution networks, enabling greater integration of renewable energy. The project will expand the 220-kilovolt and 132-kilovolt transmission infrastructure with new transmission lines and substations, modernize the medium voltage distribution network, and upgrade grid protection systems. The project will introduce Sri Lankas first grid-scale battery energy storage system at the transmission level, establish a renewable energy center to forecast and monitor renewable energy generation, and implement network automation systems with SCADA and remote terminal units, providing operators with real-time data and alerts to ensure efficient power delivery. The approval of this project reflects the significant progress made by Sri Lanka in advancing power sector reforms, which aims to enhance financial sustainability, ensure cost recovery tariff revisions, and competitive renewable energy development. ADBs support for infrastructure upgrades is contingent on these reforms, recognizing their critical role in renewable energy integration and improving the sectors overall performance. The project will strengthen the institutional capacities of Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) and Lanka Electric Company (LECO)the only utilities in the country responsible for power delivery to end-consumers. The project will improve their ability to integrate and manage renewable energy systems, adopt digital solutions, and enhance hosting capacity of rooftop solar installations. Various career development activities for CEB and LECO female staff, awareness-raising programs on safe and productive use of electricity, training on adopting clean energy solutions for women-led groups and businesses will be implemented. Of the total amount, 150 million will be provided to CEB and 50 million will go to LECO. Both financing will be guaranteed by the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka. ADB is committed to achieving a prosperous, inclusive, resilient, and sustainable Asia and the Pacific, while sustaining its efforts to eradicate extreme poverty. Established in 1966, it is owned by 69 members49 from the region. --ADB--",

        "date": "November 25, 2024 12:52 pm",
        "content": "A group of individuals holding South Korean E-8 visas is engaged in a continuous protest in front of the Sri Lanka Foreign Employment Bureau (SLFEB) in Battaramulla, demanding solutions to their issues. The E-8 visa, issued for short-term employment in South Koreas agricultural sector, is valid for six months. Protesters claimed that their visas are set to expire tomorrow (26) and insisted they would not abandon the agitation until authorities provide a definitive solution. The Chairman of the Sri Lanka Foreign Employment Bureau (SLFEB) Kosala Wickramasinghe, speaking on Ada Deranas current affairs programme Big Focus, acknowledged the issue but stated that an immediate solution could not be provided. He emphasized that illegal visa schemes had contributed to the problem and warned against falling prey to fraudulent groups. Commenting on the matter, Chairman Wickramasinghe said: Protesting is not the way to solve this issue. While we continue discussions, we will collect suggestions from the affected individuals to formulate a methodology. We will take legal action against groups involved in illegal visa schemes. Those who took money unlawfully must return it to the victims. We aim to bring this matter to a legal resolution and ensure future processes adhere to proper regulations. Speaking on illegal visa issuing schemes, the SLBFE Chairman noted Issuing visas without proper authorization burdens our citizens and tarnishes the system. Accidents or issues arising from such visas leave individuals unprotected, as they lack insurance and legal validity. We must start fresh to address this. The SLBFE Chairman reiterated that while nearly 285,000 Sri Lankans have been legally employed abroad this year, the E-8 visa holders represent a small group of approximately 100 individuals. He stressed that promoting legal and sustainable foreign employment remains the bureaus primary goal. The SLFEB further clarified that the E-8 visa system has not yet received proper authorization. Gamini Senarath Yapa, SLFEBs Director General for International Affairs, explained that currently approved systems for Korean employment include E-Face and E-7 visas. Despite these explanations, the protesting group insisted on immediate action, claiming they were misled and left vulnerable. They expressed frustration over the lack of clarity and accused the authorities of negligence. As tensions escalate, Wickramasinghe urged patience, stating, We are not ignoring this issue or playing with peoples lives. Our focus is on developing the countrys human resources through lawful means.",

        "date": "November 25, 2024 01:58 pm",
        "content": "United States international development finance corporation, which is partially funding the Colombo port terminal in Sri Lanka, is employing due diligence on the project after the allegations against the Adani Group chairman by the US Department of Justice came to light. The US agency mentioned that it hasnt concluded a final agreement on the loan worth 500 million to the conglomerate yet, according to a Bloomberg report. The project is partly owned by the Adani Group. We continue to conduct due diligence to ensure that all aspects of the project meet our rigorous standards before any loan disbursements are made, the US agency official told Bloomberg in a statement. The project has not reached financial close or signed a loan agreement, the agency added. After the allegations made in an indictment order against Gautam Adani and his six associates, it is not just the chairman and the Group that is under the scanner but also its various multinational projects. Adani, who is charged with fraud in a 250 million bribery scheme, has felt the heat of the accusations as the Kenyan government has cancelled a deal worth 2.5 billion with the Group. The agreement was signed between the Kenyan government and Adani Energy Solutions to build, upgrade and expand electricity transmission lines and capital in Nairobis Jomo Kenyatta International Airport (JKIA) on a term that the Adani Group will manage it for 30 years. Adani Group Projects in Sri Lanka The contract to develop Colombo Port was signed by the Adani Group in 2021. The project is a joint venture with Sri Lankas John Keells Holdings and the Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA), where the Gautam Adani-led company holds a majority stake. Earlier it was estimated that the project would require an investment of nearly 700 million. In November 2023, the US agency said it would loan nearly 553 million for building the Colombo Port. The joint venture was seen as a balancing act to counter Chinas influence in Sri Lanka. China had built the nearby Colombo International Container Terminal (CICT) and the Hambantota Port. Apart from this, the newly elected Sri Lankan President Anura Kumara Dissanayake had promised during elections campaign that if he comes to power, he will reconsider approval given to the Adani Groups wind power project by the previous government. Before the US allegations surfaced, the Adani Group has already been under scanner in Sri Lanka under the new government. Additionally, the matter was raised in the countrys Supreme Court.

        "title": "Philippine VP publicly threatens to have the President assassinated",
        "date": "November 25, 2024 02:24 pm",
        "content": "Philippine Vice President Sara Duterte said Saturday she has contracted an assassin to kill the president, his wife and the House of Representatives speaker if she herself is killed, in a brazen public threat that she warned was not a joke. Executive Secretary Lucas Bersamin referred the active threat against President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. to an elite presidential guards force for immediate proper action. It was not immediately clear what actions would be taken against the vice president. The Presidential Security Command boosted Marcos security and said it considered the vice presidents threat, which was made so brazenly in public, a national security issue. The presidential security force said it was coordinating with law enforcement agencies to detect, deter, and defend against any and all threats to the president and the first family. Duterte, a lawyer, later tried to walk back her remarks and said they were not an actual threat but only an expression of concern over an unspecified threat to her own life. If I expressed the concern, they will say thats a threat to the life of the president? she said. Why would I kill him if not for revenge from the grave? There is no reason for me to kill him. Whats the benefit for me? Duterte told journalists. Under the Philippine penal code, such public remarks may constitute a crime of threatening to inflict a wrong on a person or his family and is punishable by a jail term and fine. The Philippine Constitution says that if a president dies, sustains a permanent disability, is removed from office or resigns, the vice president takes over and serves the rest of the term. Marcos ran with Duterte as his vice-presidential running mate in the May 2022 elections and both won with landslide victories on a campaign call of national unity. The two leaders and their camps, however, rapidly had a bitter falling-out over key differences, including in their approaches to Chinas aggressive actions in the disputed South China Sea. Duterte resigned from the Marcos Cabinet in June as education secretary and head of an anti-insurgency body. Like her equally outspoken father, former President Rodrigo Duterte, the vice president became a vocal critic of Marcos, his wife Liza Araneta-Marcos and House Speaker Martin Romualdez, the presidents ally and cousin, accusing them of corruption, incompetence and politically persecuting the Duterte family and its close supporters. Her latest tirade was set off by the decision by House members allied with Romualdez and Marcos to detain her chief of staff, Zuleika Lopez, who was accused of hampering a congressional inquiry into the possible misuse of her budget as vice president and education secretary. Lopez was later transferred to a hospital after falling ill and wept when she heard of a plan to temporarily lock her up in a womens prison. In a pre-dawn online news conference, an angry Sara Duterte accused Marcos of incompetence as a president and of being a liar, along with his wife and the House speaker in expletives-laden remarks. When asked about concerns over her security, the 46-year-old suggested there was an unspecified plot to kill her. Dont worry about my security because Ive talked with somebody. I said if Im killed, youll kill BBM, Liza Araneta and Martin Romualdez. No joke, no joke, the vice president said without elaborating and using the initials that many use to call the president. Ive given my order, If I die, dont stop until youve killed them. And he said, yes, the vice president said. Amid the political divisions, military chief Gen. Romeo Brawner issued a statement with an assurance that the 160,000-member Armed Forces of the Philippines would remain nonpartisan with utmost respect for our democratic institutions and civilian authority. We call for calm and resolve, Brawner said. We reiterate our need to stand together against those who will try to break our bonds as Filipinos. The vice president is the daughter of Marcos predecessor, Rodrigo Duterte, whose police-enforced anti-drugs crackdown when he was a city mayor and later as president left thousands of mostly petty drug suspects dead in killings that the International Criminal Court has been investigating as a possible crime against humanity. The former president denied authorizing extrajudicial killings under his crackdown but has given conflicting statements. He told a public Philippine Senate inquiry last month that he had maintained a death squad of gangsters to kill other criminals when he was mayor of southern Davao city. Source: AP --Agencies",

        "date": "November 25, 2024 02:39 pm",
        "content": "Allegations of illegal financial gains connected to the contentious E8 visa scheme have been directed at former Minister of Labour and Foreign Employment, Manusha Nanayakkara. Kosala Wickramasinghe, Chairman of the Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment (SLBFE), levelled these accusations during Ada Deranas current affairs programme Big Focus, earlier today (25). Addressing the issue, Wickramasinghe claimed, It is problematic why a recognized minister of the government gets involved in a scheme that amounted to human trafficking. There is a lot of suspicion. We can suspect that the minister made illegal profits. We do not have evidence at the moment. We are collecting information. He further stated, There are teams and legal mechanisms in place. This is not just about the E8 visa issuethere are many other issues under investigation. Speaking at a press conference held this morning, Wickramasinghe also alleged that the E8 visa system was illegally maintained without proper employment contracts, reportedly due to the direct intervention of a former minister. According to the SLBFE, the issuance of E8 visas for short-term seasonal employment in South Korea lacks a legal framework. In response to the allegations, Manusha Nanayakkara defended his actions, emphasizing his efforts to secure employment opportunities for Sri Lankans. He explained, I personally went and requested these people to provide us with this E8 visa category. Accordingly, they made arrangements to provide this E8 visa category to Sri Lanka as well. The former minister attributed the schemes delays to certain officers within the bureau, stating, Due to the behavior and actions of certain officers of the bureau since two or three weeks before the election, it was not finally implemented. It can be implemented even now. If implemented, it is an opportunity to obtain thousands of new jobs. Nanayakkara urged the government to reconsider the program, asserting, We tell the government, and the Prime Minister, dont lose this. It is not the people I chose politically; there are people all over Sri Lanka. Give anyone the opportunity to go abroad.",
