        "title": "1 person killed and 2 assailants shot dead during an attack on a Turkish courthouse",
        "date": "February 6, 2024 06:06 pm",
        "content": "One person died and two assailants were shot dead in an attack on a courthouse in Istanbul on Tuesday, Turkish officials said. The alleged attackers, a man and woman, were killed during an attempt to attack a security checkpoint at the Caglayan courthouse at 11:46 a.m. (0846 GMT), Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya posted on social media. He said six people were wounded, including three police officers. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan later said one of the civilians died. Caglayan, which is also known as the Istanbul Justice Palace, is a huge court complex in the Kagithane district on the citys European side. Heavily guarded and with multiple entrances, it was Europes largest courthouse at the time of its opening in 2011. Camera footage published by Turkeys state-run Anadolu news agency showed the assailants being gunned down on the buildings forecourt. They appeared to shoot back at police before they were killed. Other images showed people sheltering by the gates of a metal detector inside the courthouse or running for cover. Police officers helped a man who appeared to have been wounded in the leg. Yerlikaya later identified the attackers as alleged members of the Revolutionary Peoples Liberation Party-Front, or DHKP-C, a far-left group that is considered a terrorist organization in Turkey, the United States and the European Union. The Istanbul Chief Public Prosecutors Office has opened an investigation, Turkish Justice Minister Yilmaz Tunc said. The attack took place on the day when Turkey was commemorating the anniversary of an earthquake in the countrys south that killed more than 53,000 people. The Republic of Turkey will continue to fight against all terrorist organizations and those who support them, Erdogan said at an earthquake commemoration ceremony in the southern city of Kahramanmaras. I would like to pray for the soul of the injured person who lost their life. The DHKPC has been largely inactive in recent years. In March 2015, the group took a prosecutor hostage at the same courthouse, demanding details about the police killing of a teenager during anti-government protests the previous year. Two gunmen died as police stormed the building, and the prosecutor later died of his injuries. The group also claimed responsibility for a February 2013 suicide bomb attack on the U.S. Embassy in Ankara in which a Turkish security guard was killed and four other people wounded. Last month, a man was shot and killed at an Istanbul church in an attack that was claimed by the Islamic State group. Two men were later arrested on suspicion of killing Tuncer Cihan, 52, on Jan. 28 at the Santa Maria Church in the Buyukdere neighborhood. Dozens of suspected IS members and supporters also were detained. Source: The Associated Press --Agencies",

        "date": "February 6, 2024 06:14 pm",
        "content": "The Sri Lankan Speakers Office has deemed recent reports surrounding the much-disputed Online Safety Bill as ill-informed and baseless, while rejecting claims that the Bill was passed in violation of the Supreme Courts determination. Issuing a clarification to the public in response to allegations regarding the passing of the Bill, the Speakers Office highlighted that due to the legislative process of the Parliament involving both, the Attorney Generals Department and the Legal Draftsmans Department, it is unlikely that a Bill would be passed in violation of the determination of the Supreme Court. There is no opportunity to act in a manner that is not in accordance with a Supreme Court determination regarding a Bill or in violation of the Constitution, the statement read in this regard. The Speakers Office provided a detailed explanation of the due process followed when passing a Bill and its process of enactment in a bid to set the record straight and to prevent the public from being duped. Thus, The Speakers Office assured that while the Online Safety Bill was passed in accordance with the Supreme Courts determination, those parliamentarians who still claim otherwise are urged to specifically mention what recommendations were ignored, so that the relevant authorities could respond to these allegations accordingly. The Speaker has no discretion on such matters, the statement further read, emphasising that the Parliament Speaker has no discretion to enact laws and make amendments to Bills.

        "title": "Yandex: Owner of Russias Google pulls out of home country",
        "date": "February 6, 2024 06:44 pm",
        "content": "The owner of Yandex, often referred to as Russias Google, has said it will pull out of its country of origin. Its Dutch-based parent company sold the operation in Russia for 475 billion roubles (5.2bn; 4.2bn), much lower than its estimated market value. The sale to a consortium of investors means Yandexs Russian business is now a fully Russian-owned entity. The firm has previously been accused of hiding information about the war in Ukraine from the Russian public. Moscow has welcomed the latest deal which the company said was the product of an extensive period of planning and negotiation over more than 18 months. This is exactly what we wanted to achieve a few years ago when Yandex was under threat of being taken over by Western IT giants, said Anton Gorelkin, deputy head of the Russian parliaments committee on information policy. Yandex is more than a company, it is an asset of the entire Russian society, he added. Set up in the dotcom boom in the late 1990s, Yandex developed its own search engine, mapping and advertising businesses. Other services include taxis and food delivery. The 5.2bn deal is believed to be significantly lower than Yandexs market value, which was worth around 30bn in 2021. Despite its nickname of Russias Google, Yandex has no ties to the US search engine giant or its parent company Alphabet. Since Russias invasion of Ukraine, many foreign-owned businesses have exited the country, often selling assets on unfavourable terms. Russian president Vladimir Putin also ordered the seizure of others, such as assets belonging to Western brands Danone and Carlsberg. Yandexs co-founder, Arkady Volozh, is one of very few top Russia-linked businessmen to have publicly spoken out against Russias invasion of Ukraine. He left the firm in 2022. Mr Volozh has been hit with sanctions by the European Union, which in 2022 said Yandex is responsible for promoting Russian state media and narratives in its search results, and deranking and removing content critical of the Kremlin, such as content related to Russias war of aggression against Ukraine. He is seeking a European Union court to remove sanctions as he says he was never close to the Russian president Vladimir Putin. To comply with the Russian governments demands over its content, Yandex sold some of its online resources to state-controlled rival VK in late 2022. Even though Yandex presents itself as independent of the authorities, experiments by BBC Monitoring in 2022 showed that its search results failed to report Russian atrocities in Ukrainian city of Bucha.

        "title": "Top US diplomat pursues Gaza truce quest as Israel presses onslaught",
        "date": "February 6, 2024 07:32 pm",
        "content": "U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken met Egypts president on Tuesday as part of a 48-hour, four-nation flurry of shuttle diplomacy in search of a ceasefire in Gazas war, while Israel pressed its onslaught in the south of the enclave. Israel said its forces had killed dozens of Palestinian gunmen throughout Gaza in the past 24 hours with fighting focused on Khan Younis in the south, with a threatened assault looming on a nearby border town teeming with displaced people. Blinken arrived in Egypt after a stop in Saudi Arabia, and then departed for Qatar, for meetings with the main countries acting as mediators in the Gaza war. Palestinians hope the U.S. top diplomats Middle East swing will nail down a ceasefire before Israeli forces storm Gazas southern fringes where over a million displaced people are sheltering. It was Blinkens first visit to the region since Washington brokered an offer, with Israeli input, for the wars first extended ceasefire. Qatar and Egypt conveyed the offer last week to Hamas, which says it wants guarantees Israel will withdraw, before it agrees to free remaining hostages its fighters captured in the Oct. 7 attack that precipiated the war. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said Blinken and Saudi Arabias ruling crown prince discussed regional steps to achieve an enduring end to the war, tackling the humanitarian disaster in Gaza and limiting regional spillovers of the crisis. Blinken departed Riyadh just after sunrise and arrived in Cairo where he met with President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, then swiftly departed for a flight to Qatar. He is due in Israel overnight for consultations on Wednesday morning. Washington has for weeks sought an elusive deal to secure the release of remaining hostages in return for a long pause to fighting. There was no immediate word from any side whether Blinkens talks in Riyadh and Cairo had yielded progress. A Hamas official who asked not to be identified told Reuters on Tuesday the Palestinian Islamist movement was not budging from its stance that there can be no hostage releases unless the war ends and Israeli forces leave Gaza. Israel says any truce must be temporary and it will fight on until Hamas is wiped out. But there is also a growing movement demanding more effort to bring the hostages home, even if that means a deal with Hamas. A nonpartisan think-tank, the Israel Democracy Institute, issued a poll on Tuesday finding that 51 believe recovering the hostages should be the main goal of the war, while 36 said it should be toppling Hamas. As outlined by sources close to the talks, the offer envisages a truce of at least 40 days when militants would free civilians among remaining hostages they are holding, followed by later phases to hand over soldiers and bodies, in exchange for releases of Palestinians imprisoned in Israel. The only truce so far lasted just a week in November, during which 110 hostages were freed in exchange for 240 Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails. Washington also aims to prevent further escalation elsewhere in the Middle East, after days of U.S. airstrikes on armed proxies of Iran, a major backer of Hamas, and further attacks on Red Sea shipping by Yemens Tehran-aligned Houthi militia. In an update on Tuesday, Gazas Health Ministry said at least 27,585 Palestinians had been confirmed killed in Israels military campaign, with thousands more feared buried under vast tracts of rubble across the densely populated enclave. Some 107 had been killed in the past 24 hours, the ministry said. Israel says 226 of its soldiers have been killed in its offensive, launched after militants from Hamas-ruled Gaza burst through the border fence and killed 1,200 people and took 253 hostages in a rampage through nearby Israeli communities. THE DEAD ARE IN COMFORT, THE LIVING ARE IN PAIN Israeli forces on Tuesday kept up the pressure on Khan Younis, the focus of their offensive for weeks. Aerial and tank bombardment thundered through the shattered city overnight, with at least 14 people killed by air strikes since the pre-dawn hours, Palestinian residents and medics told Reuters. They said Israeli tanks and aircraft continued to pound and besiege areas around Khan Youniss two main hospitals - Nasser and Al-Amal. Israels military says Hamas militants use hospital premises for cover, which Gazas ruling Islamists deny. Rafah, Palestinians last southern refuge from Israeli advances towards the border with Egypt, was battered by several Israeli air strikes and tank shelling overnight with medics reporting at least several wounded among the many displaced. Displaced again and again by Israels military offensive on Gaza, Mahmoud Amer and his family had pitched their tent in a cemetery in Rafah, hoping they would be safer living among the dead, including the wars victims in their freshly dug graves. Its better than living in residential areas where the houses could collapse on our heads, said Amer, who spent weeks in other locations as the family made their way southwards from northern Gaza, fleeing Israels advance. There is no water, no proper aid coming in. The situation is so bad, he said. The dead are in comfort, while we, the living, are in pain. Source - Reuters - Agencies",

        "date": "February 6, 2024 08:59 pm",
        "content": "Donald Trump does not have presidential immunity and can be prosecuted on charges of plotting to overturn the 2020 election, a US court has ruled. Mr Trump had claimed in the landmark legal case that he was immune from criminal charges for acts he said fell within his duties as president. But Tuesdays ruling in Washington DC struck down that claim. It is a setback for Mr Trump who has for years cited presidential immunity while battling multiple cases. The former president is expected to appeal against the ruling, meaning the case could ultimately go to the Supreme Court where conservatives hold a 6-3 majority. US Special Counsel Jack Smith has charged Mr Trump, 77, with conspiring to overturn Joe Bidens victory in the 2020 election and committing fraud to stay in office. The trial in that case was initially scheduled for 4 March, but was postponed pending a ruling on the immunity claim. It could be delayed for weeks, if not months, if the case ends up before the Supreme Court. Earlier this month, a panel of judges heard the case at the DC Circuit Court of Appeals in Washington DC. The argument from Mr Trumps lawyer hinged on the idea that a president who is not convicted for impeachment by Congress cannot be subject to criminal proceedings. Mr Trump, they noted, was impeached by the House of Representatives but never convicted by the Senate. The judges, however, sounded sceptical. Judge Florence Pan suggested that, with immunity, a president could sell state secrets or order the assassination of a political rival without being concerned about criminal prosecution.

        "title": "Sri Lankan Catholic church to begin canonization process for hundreds killed in Easter attacks",
        "date": "February 6, 2024 09:52 pm",
        "content": "The Archdiocese of Colombo, Sri Lanka, is set to begin the canonization process for the hundreds of faithful killed in the 2019 Easter Sunday terrorist attack in the country, an archdiocesan official confirmed with CNA. Fr. Joy Indika Perera, a representative for Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith of Colombo, told CNA in an email last week that the archdiocese plans to submit a petition to the Vatican to declare those killed in the Easter Sunday attacks martyrs of faith. Fr. Perera said the archdiocese will be submitting the petition on April 21, exactly five years after the attacks took place. That is the minimum amount of time required by the Church to open a persons canonization cause. The petition will be submitted to the Vaticans Dicastery for the Causes of Saints. Eight suicide bombers targeted two Catholic churches, one evangelical church, three luxury hotels, and other locations on April 19, 2019, killing an estimated 269 people and injuring more than 500. Perera said that 216 Catholics from two different churches, St. Sebastian and St. Anthony, were massacred in cold blood in the attack. Shortly after the attacks, the Islamic State claimed responsibility for the bombings. The Sri Lankan government determined the attack to have been carried out by a local radical Islamist group known as National Thowheeth Jamaath, with the assistance of foreign groups. Out of fear of additional attacks, in-person Masses were suspended and Catholic schools were closed in the archdiocese for several weeks. Speaking on behalf of the cardinal, Fr. Perera criticized the governments response to the massacre, accusing it of still doing its best to hide information about the attacks and those responsible. Cardinal Ranjith has been always insisting on the discovery of the truth behind these attacks as there are clear indications that it was a deliberate act of political manipulation by some interested parties who made use of the Islamic extremists for their diabolical plot, Perera said. Up to now no serious investigation has taken place in order to find out the real cause of this massacre, he added. Maithripala Sirisena, who was president of Sri Lanka at the time, created a five-person commission to investigate the attacks. In October 2020, five suspects arrested in connection with the attacks were released by the government, citing a lack of evidence. The trial of 25 of the men accused of preparing the attacks began in November 2021 but was adjourned in January 2022. In January 2023 a seven-judge panel from Sri Lankas Supreme Court found Sirisena and four other high-ranking government officials liable for the massacre because they possessed but failed to disclose credible information warning of the attacks. The court ordered Sirisena to pay victims families a total of 273,000 from his personal funds while other officials were similarly disciplined. In April 2022, Pope Francis urged the government of Sri Lanka to take greater action to identify the perpetrators and bring justice for the victims and their families. Please and for the sake of justice, for the love of your people, may it be clarified definitively who was responsible for these events. This will bring peace to your conscience and to the nation, the pope said. Perera said the cardinal is prioritizing opening the Easter martyrs canonization because he is convinced they died for their faith. He believes that since they were exercising an act of faith by coming to the church to participate in the liturgy of the risen Lord and to take part in spiritual activities of their own free will, and they had to lay down their lives for having done that, this fact itself is a cause good enough to promote them to the level of Servants of God and martyrs of the faith, Perera said. Perera said the archdiocese hopes to receive approval from the Holy See and that once this approval is given, we will work on the process of beatification and consider them Servants of God.

        "date": "February 6, 2024 10:57 pm",
        "content": "While welcoming the participants to Colombo, Sri Lanka, to the South Asia Hydromet Forum (SAHF) IV President Ranil Wickremesinghe today (Feb.06) emphasized the island nations commitment to address climate change through collaborative efforts at regional and international levels. In his address at the inaugural session at the Galle Face Hotel this morning, under the theme Unlocking Regional Synergies, President Wickremesinghe highlighted the pressing issues of adaptation and mitigation in combating climate change. President Wickremesinghe reiterated Sri Lankas commitment to supporting regional efforts in climate change mitigation and adaptation. He highlighted initiatives such as the establishment of an international climate change university, aimed at providing postgraduate education and training to officials from various countries. Additionally, the President proposed the creation of a tropical belt as a carbon sink as discussed during COP 28 in Dubai, emphasizing the importance of private sector investment in sustainable development projects within this region. Regarding mitigation efforts, President Wickremesinghe outlined Sri Lankas plans to enhance its meteorological organizations despite recent challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic and economic crises. He underscored the necessity of a comprehensive Hydromet regional network to effectively address climate change-related challenges, particularly in South Asia, where the adverse effects are mostly felt. The forum, scheduled to run until Feb.08, aims to facilitate discussions and collaborations on hydrology and meteorology-related initiatives in South Asia. SAHF initiated in 2018, connects National Meteorological and Hydrological Service providers (NMHSs) from the region to promote data and knowledge exchange, addressing technical challenges and enhancing collaboration. Reflecting on the urgent need for action, President Wickremesinghe drew attention to the economic repercussions of climate change, citing potential GDP losses of up to 2 in low-income countries. He recounted Sri Lankas recent experiences with unexpected rainfall and highlighted the broader regional impacts, including those stemming from the melting of the Himalayas. President Ranil Wickremesinghe underscored the necessity of establishing a regional network to facilitate collective action. In addition to this, the Sri Lankan government is actively promoting two key initiatives. Firstly, plans are underway to establish an international climate change university, designed to offer postgraduate programs akin to those provided by institutions like the East West Centre in Hawaii. Discussions are in progress with various countries and institutions to ensure its establishment as a stakeholder university, aimed at fostering comprehensive engagement. This endeavour is expected to play a vital role in addressing climate challenges not only in Sri Lanka but also across the region and in Africa. Secondly, President Ranil Wickremesinghe outlined a significant proposal presented at the Dubai COP28, emphasizing the concept of utilizing the tropical belt as a carbon sink. Highlighting the potential of the tropical belt, with its diverse ecosystems including marshes and forests, to absorb carbon emissions, he underscored its suitability as a prime region for carbon sequestration. The President stressed the importance of facilitating private sector investment in these countries to support such initiatives, emphasizing that leveraging private investments is crucial for achieving sustainable development goals. He emphasized that while traditional sources of aid may not suffice, attracting private sector investments could yield substantial benefits for all parties involved. Moreover, President Wickremesinghe highlighted the collaborative efforts within the Indian Ocean Rim Association (IORA) to explore opportunities across the region. To advance this proposal, he announced plans to establish a panel of experts to conduct in-depth studies. Further, President Wickremesinghe discussed potential funding mechanisms, suggesting the establishment of a loss and damage fund to address residual challenges. While acknowledging the challenges of securing funding solely for loss and damage, he proposed exploring alternative avenues, including debt relief for countries willing to invest in climate mitigation efforts within the tropical belt. These measures, he asserted, are essential for realizing the potential of the tropical belt as a key contributor to global carbon reduction efforts. The Head of State concluded by expressing hope that the discussions at the forum would lead to innovative solutions and initiatives to tackle climate change in the region. He encouraged participants to contribute their ideas and expertise to on-going projects aimed at climate change mitigation and adaptation. Co-Chair of the South Asia Hydromet Forum (SAHF) and Director of the National Centre for Hydrology and Meteorology in Bhutan, Karma Dupchu, along with esteemed guests including Director of the South Asia Region at the World Bank (WB), Dina Umali-Deininger, and High Commissioner of the United Kingdom, Andrew Patrick, convened at the forum.

        "date": "February 6, 2024 11:30 pm",
        "content": "An array of unconventional, privately funded plans to exploit the moon, including as a site for human ashes and sports-drink containers, has gathered steam in recent years as NASA pushes to make Earths natural satellite more accessible. Concerns about possible gaps in U.S. oversight and legal questions about proper use of the moon have rocketed to the forefront. Landers built by private companies and emerging space powers are expected in the next few years to join the U.S. flag and other vestiges of past programs to the moon. Other initiatives could include using the moon as a site for capsules of human remains, advertising sports drinks, and maybe even a two-story-tall Christian cross made of the moons own dirt. Were just at the beginning of exploring the moon, and ... we need to be careful were not contaminating it - not just with biological and chemical contamination but with litter, said Leslie Tennen, an attorney practicing international space law. Among the payloads aboard a recent private moon mission by U.S. company Astrobotic - which ultimately failed to reach the moons surface - were dozens of capsules of human ashes and a can of Japanese sports drink Pocari Sweat. The exact purpose of the can was unclear. Under U.S. law, those items and anything else can go to the moon, as long as the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration and other agencies certify a rocket payloads launch off Earth does not jeopardize public health and safety ... U.S. national security ... or international obligations of the United States. The issue will gain more attention as the National Aeronautics and Space Administration leans heavily on private companies to cut the costs of its trips to the moon. At present, there are no U.S. laws or standards outlining what is acceptable on the celestial bodys surface. NASA envisions long-term moon bases and hopes to spur a competitive commercial marketplace. Lawyers with space-law expertise worry that the absence of regulations could pit U.S. companies against other countries operating on the lunar surface or spark international disputes over which private endeavors could be considered land appropriation or claims of sovereignty. The lack of guidelines has some eying the possibilities. Justin Park, a Washington, D.C.-based entrepreneur, wants to build a Christian cross on the moon potentially as big as a two-story building and made of hardened lunar dirt, an estimated 1 billion undertaking he has discussed with U.S. lawmakers and Catholic organizations. Nobody owns the moon, Park said. You dont want to stomp on traditions, but you cant hold the rest of the world back. Overly restrictive regulations for moon activities, he said, would destroy an industry before it gets off the ground. RELIGIOUS TEST Texas-based Celestis, which launches cremated human remains into space and had arranged the ashes on Astrobotics Peregrine lander, drew ire from the Navajo Nation, which regards the moon as sacred and considered the companys memorial mission sacrilege. Celestis CEO Charles Schafer said memorials of the dead in space are inevitable as more humans traverse the cosmos. We dont make space mission decisions on the basis of a religious test, Schafer said. I have a photo of 20,000 Buddhist monks celebrating our launch. So which religion rules? NASA officials overseeing the program that helped fund Astrobotics mission have said they have no control over what companies put on their landers, and that payload standards could be created in the future. Youll see that evolve quite a bit over time, said Chris Culbert, head of NASAs Commercial Lunar Payload Services program. But I think the first step is a successful landing - thats what we care about most in these early steps. Some officials at NASA and space agencies from other countries have privately regarded the ashes and sports drink as obstructions and trash that would set a negative precedent, according to two U.S. officials who asked not to be identified. With another private U.S. lunar lander due to launch next month, the lack of lunar regulation risks bringing Washington in conflict with the widely ratified 1967 Outer Space Treaty, lawyers said. That pact says countries must authorize and supervise the activities of nongovernmental entities. That raises the stakes for the space industry, Biden administration and lawmakers who have battled for months over how to regulate novel commercial space activities, with industry groups resisting what they call innovation-stifling regulations. Few countries have adopted standards for moon behavior, and rules remain unclear in international law, lawyers said. Some feel too little has been done internationally to guide moon behavior. We are already late, and we are very urgently in need to start now, to discuss the moon at an international level, said Martha Mejía-Kaiser, a Mexican-German space lawyer and board member of the International Institute of Space Law.

        "title": "Chiles former president dies in helicopter crash",
        "date": "February 7, 2024 06:05 am",
        "content": "Chilean ex-President Sebastian Pinera died in a helicopter crash on Tuesday, sending the country he led for two terms into mourning and prompting an outpouring of condolences from leaders across Latin America. The helicopter carrying Pinera, 74, and three others plunged into a lake in southern Chile. The former president was pronounced dead shortly after rescue personnel arrived at the scene. The other three passengers survived. Two sources told Reuters Pinera was the pilot, although officials have not confirmed that, nor the helicopters intended destination. Pinera often spent the Southern Hemisphere summers near the picturesque lakes that dot Chiles south, and frequently piloted his own helicopter. President Gabriel Boric declared three days of national mourning, while preparations have begun for a state funeral on Friday for the former leader, who served two non-consecutive terms between 2010 and 2022. Interior Minister Carolina Toha said the ex-presidents body had been recovered from the lake, near the town of Lago Ranco. We remember him for the way he dedicated his life to public service, said Toha, who has been helping to lead efforts to battle deadly wildfires in recent days. Pinera was perhaps best known abroad for his role overseeing the spectacular rescue in 2010 of 33 miners who were trapped underneath the Atacama desert. The event became a global media sensation and was the subject of a 2014 movie, The 33. In Chile, he was known as a successful businessman whose first term was boosted by rapid economic growth but who was often seen as out-of-touch with the countrys fast-changing society. Both his presidencies were marred by frequent protests - of students demanding education reform in the first term, and of wider and often violent protests against inequality in his second term that ended with the government promising to draft a new constitution. After leaving the presidency, Pinera remained active in politics, speaking out on issues like the attempt to draft a new constitution - which ultimately failed - and backing conservative politicians in the region, including Argentine President Javier Milei. Former Argentine President Mauricio Macri expressed his sadness at the news of Pineras death. He was a good person, committed like no one else to Chile and to the values of freedom and democracy in Latin America, he said. BUSINESS SUCCESS The son of a prominent centrist politician, Pinera was a Harvard-trained economist who made his fortune introducing credit cards to Chile in the 1980s. He was also a major shareholder in the flagship airline formerly known as LAN, local soccer team Colo-Colo, and a television station, although he sold most of those holdings when he took over the presidency in March 2010. As of 2024, he was ranked 1,176 on Forbes global rich list, with a net worth of 2.7 billion. Known for a driven and competitive personality, one friend described Pinera as someone who could be a bully, reluctant to delegate responsibility. He was also a risk-taker who enjoyed deep-sea diving. Running for election to the presidency after a spell as a center-right senator, he wooed moderate voters by portraying himself as the leader of a new right and an entrepreneur who made his fortune with hard work. At the same time, he distanced himself from the 1973-1990 rule of General Augusto Pinochet, when more than 3,000 suspected leftists were killed or disappeared. He lost his first attempt at the top job in 2005 to popular center-left leader Michelle Bachelet, but she was barred constitutionally from running for a second consecutive term and in 2009 he beat ex-president Eduardo Frei by a small margin. That ended the 20-year rule of the center-left and fended off the bitter memories of Pinochets bloody dictatorship that had hurt the right in past elections. His honeymoon with the electorate was short-lived, though, and his stiff manner contrasted with the more amiable Bachelet, who both preceded and succeeded him as president. Despite plaudits for his governments economic record, many Chileans felt he did not do enough to tackle deep inequality or address inadequacies in the countrys education system. Pinera and his wife Cecilia Morel had four children. Source: Reuters -Agencies",

        "date": "February 7, 2024 06:52 am",
        "content": "Former Minister Keheliya Rambukwella, who is in remand custody, has refused to attend the parliamentary session today (Feb.07) despite being given permission, the Prisons Department said. The Fifth Session of the Ninth Parliament will be ceremoniously declared open by President Ranil Wickremesinghe this morning. The Parliament was prorogued with effect from midnight on January 26, by way of a proclamation published in the government gazette. On Tuesday (Feb.06), the former health minister had tendered his resignation to President Ranil Wickremesinghe, who in return, had accepted it. Later, a gazette notification was published, confirming the resignation of Rambukwella as the Environment Minister. The SLPP parliamentarian was arrested on February 02 after he arrived at the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) to record a statement on the substandard human immunoglobulin procurement scandal. He was reportedly interrogated for nearly 10 hours before being placed under arrest. The following day, Rambukwella was remanded until February 15 and admitted to the Prison Hospital house later. During the court proceedings that day, the prosecution told the Maligakanda Magistrate Lochani Abeywickrama that Rambukwella had removed the suppliers registered with the National Medicines Regulatory Authority (NMRA) and enabled unregistered suppliers to enter the procurement process. The magistrate also heard that there was no shortage of human immunoglobulin vaccine at the time when the former health minister sought Cabinet approval to make emergency purchases for a list of certain medicinal drugs. The former health ministers arrest came hot on the heels of pressure from civil society activists and health sector trade unionists, who have been protesting time after time against the law enforcement authorities failure to put him behind bars. Prior to Rambukwellas apprehension, seven arrests had been made in connection with the drug procurement scam. But the fifth accused was later released on bail. As such, the former Health Secretary, the Director of the Health Ministrys Medical Supplies Division (MSD) and three other officials of the same division, as well as the owner of the company, which is said to have supplied the substandard batch of immunoglobulin vials, now remain in custody on remand. In October 2023, the NMRA revealed that forged documents were found to have been submitted for Customs clearance to procure a batch of 22,500 vials containing human immunoglobulin, an antibody produced by blood plasma cells, which later failed the quality tests. The product, which was said to have been manufactured by Livealth Biopharma Pvt Ltd. India and imported by a local medicine supplier called Isolez Biotech Pharma AG (Pvt) Ltd. However, the India-based manufacturer has denied having a hand in this fraudulent activity and communicated to the NMRA that it has neither manufactured, supplied nor exported these products to any party. Soon after the human immunoglobulin scandal became a hot topic, Rambukwella was stripped of the health ministerial portfolio and was appointed as the Environment Minister in a Cabinet reshuffle in October 2023. Dr. Ramesh Pathirana was thus appointed as the Health Minister in addition to his current portfolio as Minister of Industries.",

        "date": "February 7, 2024 09:36 am",
        "content": "Minister of Foreign Affairs, Ali Sabry says strengthening and carrying forward President Ranil Wickremesinghes program to establish free trade agreements (FTAs) with other countries is crucial to ensure Sri Lankas economic stability and prevent future downturns. Speaking at a press briefing titled Collective Path to a Stable Country held at the President Media Centre (PMC) on Tuesday (Feb.06), Minister Sabry elaborated on the governments plans to establish FTAs with India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Vietnam, and China by the end of 2024. He expressed optimism that these agreements would open up new markets for Sri Lankan businesses, contributing directly to the nations economic growth. Minister Sabry highlighted the recent FTA with Thailand as a historic step towards achieving President Wickremesinghes vision of a stable economy. He emphasized that this agreement has already provided Sri Lanka access to a USD 2.2 billion market, representing a significant advancement. The Minister signified the governments commitment to diversifying Sri Lankas trade partnerships and strengthening its economic resilience through strategic FTAs. By expanding access to new markets and promoting trade, these agreements aim to create a more robust and sustainable economic foundation for the country. Sri Lanka significantly lags behind regional competitors like Vietnam and Bangladesh. This issue was highlighted by Minister Sabry, who pointed out the vast difference in export earnings. While Vietnam boasts exports of USD 370 billion and Bangladesh at USD 60 billion, Sri Lanka struggles with a mere USD 12-14 billion. Minister Sabry further emphasized this disparity by comparing historical and present data. In the 1990s, exports contributed a significant 30 to Sri Lankas GDP, compared to a meagre 15 today. This decline reflects a missed opportunity to capitalize on the global market, unlike neighbouring countries that actively pursued FTAs. The main reason behind Sri Lankas export struggles is its limited market access. While focusing primarily on the domestic market, countries like Vietnam and Bangladesh actively expanded into larger international markets through FTAs. This strategic move fuelled their export-driven growth, leaving Sri Lanka behind. Recognizing this challenge, President Ranil Wickremesinghe embarked on a long-term program to establish FTAs with Asian countries. By unlocking new markets and empowering the export economy, this initiative aims to revitalize Sri Lankas economic growth and build a more resilient future, the minister explained. Sri Lankas economy is set for a significant boost thanks to a recently signed free trade agreement with Thailand and on-going negotiations with other major economies. This agreement, along with technical assistance from Thailand, is expected to attract substantial investments in key sectors like fisheries, tourism, agriculture, and renewable energy. By the end of 2024, Sri Lanka aims to finalize free trade agreements with India, China, Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Vietnam. These agreements have the potential to significantly expand market access for Sri Lankan businesses and attract even more foreign investment. These developments are seen as crucial steps towards stabilizing Sri Lankas economy and laying the foundation for future prosperity. The minister emphasized the potential for further economic growth through increased trade with the wider world, he added further. Secretary to the Ministry of Foreign Ministry Mrs. Aruni Wijewardene and a group of officials were also present at the briefing. --PMD",

Wickremesinghe further announced a significant turnaround in the nations economic landscape. Despite the 1.9 balance payments deficit in 2022, the island nation has achieved a surplus by the end of 2023, marking the first such occurrence since 1977. He said Sri Lanka has witnessed a noteworthy achievement in fiscal management, adding that despite a budget primary deficit of 3.7 of GDP in 2022, the country managed to achieve a primary budget surplus in 2023, marking the sixth instance of such success in the 76 years since independence. The President emphasized the remarkable turnaround in the financial performance of major state-owned enterprises which suffered a loss of Rs. 745 billion by the end of 2022, but managed to generate a profit of Rs. 313 billion by September 2023. In a notable development for the tourism sector, President Wickremesinghe revealed a substantial increase in tourist arrivals.

        "date": "February 7, 2024 01:27 pm",
        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe, delivering the governments policy statement in Parliament on Wednesday (Feb.07), revealed that the government aims to alleviate the tax burden on the people as the economy continues to stabilize with the implementation of economic reforms. He said this will provide room for a potential revision of the Value-Added Tax (VAT) percentage, which was increased from 15 to 18 with effect from the outset of 2024. Acknowledging that the VAT hike poses a burden for many people, the President said the government is systematically addressing this issue. The Head of State presented the governments policy statement to the House after ceremonially declaring open the Fifth Session of the Ninth Parliament on Wednesday morning. The President said there has been a substantial increase in tax registration, with the number of registered taxpayers soaring from 437,547 in 2022 to 1,000,029 by the end of 2023, recording an increase of 130. As the tax network expands, the burden on individuals and organizations will diminish. He promised to take measures to increase the benefits provided to the people as the governments revenue increases. Speaking further on the economic reforms undertaken by the government to ride out the crisis, Wickremesinghe emphasized that the country is now experiencing tangible growth, which is evident in the current social discourse. Not long ago, conversations cantered around the challenges posed by power cuts, demanding uninterrupted electricity. Today, the discourse has shifted to electricity bills. Previously, concerns were raised about the exorbitant black market price of petrol, with talk of spending days in fuel queues. Now, the focus is on new oil companies investing in Sri Lanka. Issues related to the scarcity of vegetables have transformed into discussions about the prices of carrots. The prior scarcity of paper for book printing is now replaced by discussions about VAT. Further, the President expressed optimism about achieving economic growth of 2 to 3 this year, with efforts underway to increase it to 5 by 2025, based on predictions from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank, and the Asian Development Bank (ADB). Stating that his decision-making was driven by the countrys growth and not political gain, the President expressed confidence that, in time, these tough measures would be acknowledged and appreciated by the people. Wickremesinghe said this journey to economic recovery progressed methodically: In the 2022 interim budget, I highlighted the countrys critical situation at that time, aiming to avert an economic collapse. Through the 2023 budget, several proposals were presented to guide the economy towards stability, showcasing a step-by-step approach to our overarching goals. The 2024 budget proposals mark the initial stride in essential reforms aimed at propelling economic development. Despite challenges and occasional reluctance, the President opined that the economic reforms and policies the government has instituted have set the country on the trajectory towards a stable economy, earning recognition from international financial institutions for our targeted approach. Wickremesinghe also announced plans to implement a debt restructuring strategy within the first half of 2024, which he views as the foundational framework for restoring the economy to normalcy and alleviating debt pressures. By September 2023 our total debt burden was USD 91 billion. It will take a considerable period of time to settle this debt. He stressed the need to source the funds locally in order to pay off the countrys debt. It is imperative that we generate this income; otherwise, we risk falling into the debt trap once again. As a result of debt restructuring, Wickremesinghe said Sri Lanka would be able to reduce the annual payment. Nevertheless, even under such a situation the country will still have to pay around USD 3 billion per year, he said adding that we need to create a balance between income and expenditure. Our budget deficit is at an acute stage. This year government revenue stood at Rs. 4,127 billion and expenditure was Rs. 6,978 billion. Out of this Rs. 2,651 billion is for debt repayment. This, clearly, indicates our debt burden. Emphasizing the importance of breaking free from the shackles of a debt-driven mentality, the President said Sri Lanka needs to focus on building a robust, independent economy while eliminating the debt economy. Rapidly increasing export income and foreign investment are crucial components of this transformative journey.  Central to this process is the eradication of corruption and social modernization. Speaking on educational and health reforms, the Head of State said the government aims to modernize these sectors, ensuring the protection of vulnerable sections and fostering economic growth. As the countrys future heavily relies on new technological knowledge, Wickremesinghe revealed that in pursuit of this goal, the government is formulating a policy to offer university education to every high school graduate and establishing science and technology universities. We are laying the groundwork to nurture a new generation equipped with contemporary knowledge and technology. The President extended an invitation to the main opposition Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) to collaborate with him in the nation-building endeavours. In the interest of the nations welfare and the prosperity of our youth, the majority of the Podujana Peramuna have set aside past animosities and reached a consensus. Likewise, longstanding political allies have aligned with the Samagi Jana Balawegaya, including those whom I, personally, introduced to the political arena. If the Podujana Peramuna can unite for the greater good, why cant the Samagi Jana Balawegaya follow suit? Wickremesinghe said the people should initiate change within themselves, fostering unity and enlightenment. Attached below is the governments policy statement delivered by President Wickremesinghe: Government Policy Statement... by Adaderana Online",

A group of 97 sportspersons including a badminton player represented Sri Lanka in the 2023 Asian Games held in Hangzhou, China. It is alleged that Buwaneka Goonethilake, who secured the title as the National Badminton Champion for 03 consecutive years, was replaced by the runner-up Viren Nettasinghe. Investigations were initiated into the matter by the special investigation unit probing sports-related offences, after a complaint was filed by Mrs. Preethi Disna Ileperuma, the mother of Buwaneka Goonethilake. Later, the investigation unit had submitted a progress report to the Colombo Chief Magistrates Court, stating that Goonethilake consecutively placed first at the National Badminton Championship in the years 2021, 2022 and 2023, and nevertheless, Nettasinghe participated in the 2023 Asian Games. Furthermore, the Chief Police Inspector of the special investigation unit had requested the court to issue an order summoning the Sri Lanka Badminton Association, since its officials have not assisted in the relevant investigations.

        "title": "Hamas proposes 135-day Gaza truce with total Israeli withdrawal",
        "date": "February 7, 2024 04:15 pm",
        "content": "Hamas has proposed a ceasefire plan that would quiet the guns in Gaza for four-and-a-half months, during which all hostages would go free, Israel would withdraw its troops from the Gaza Strip and an agreement would be reached on an end to the war. The militant groups proposal - a response to an offer sent last week by Qatari and Egyptian mediators - comes in the biggest diplomatic push yet for an extended halt to the fighting, and was met with hope and relief in the Gaza Strip. There was no immediate public response from Israel, which has said it will not pull its troops out of Gaza until Hamas is wiped out. According to a draft document seen by Reuters, the Hamas counterproposal envisages three phases of a truce, lasting 45 days each. Militants would exchange remaining Israeli hostages they captured on Oct. 7 for Palestinian prisoners. The reconstruction of Gaza would begin, Israeli forces would withdraw completely, and bodies and remains would be exchanged. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken arrived overnight in Israel after meeting the leaders of mediators Qatar and Egypt in an attempt to reach an extended truce. A source close to the negotiations said the Hamas counterproposal did not require a guarantee of a permanent ceasefire at the outset, but that an end to the war would have to be agreed during the truce before the final hostages were freed. According to the document, during the first 45-day phase, all Israeli women hostages, males under 19 and the elderly and sick would be released, in exchange for the release of Palestinian women and children from Israeli jails. Israel would also withdraw its troops from populated areas during the first phase. Implementation of the second phase would not begin until the sides conclude indirect talks over the requirements needed to end the mutual military operations and return to complete calm. The second phase would include the release of remaining male hostages and the withdrawal of Israeli forces outside the borders of all areas of the Gaza Strip. Bodies and remains would be exchanged during the third phase. The truce would also increase the flow of food and other aid to Gazas desperate civilians, who are facing hunger and dire shortages of basic supplies. People are optimistic, at the same time they pray that this hope turns into a real agreement that will end the war, said Yamen Hamad, a father of four, living in a U.N. school in Deir Al-Balah in the central Gaza Strip. People are awaiting news of a ceasefire, they are a bit hopeful despite the continued bombardment, he told Reuters via a messaging app. Israel began its military offensive in Gaza after militants from Hamas-ruled Gaza killed 1,200 people and took 253 hostages in southern Israel on Oct. 7. Gazas Health Ministry says at least 27,585 Palestinians have been confirmed killed in Israels military campaign, with thousands more feared buried under rubble. So far, the only truce lasted just a week at the end of November. BLINKEN TO MEET NETANYAHU Blinken is set to discuss the Hamas counterproposal with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu later on Wednesday. Washington has cast the hostage and truce deal as part of plans for a wider resolution of the Middle East conflict, ultimately leading to reconciliation between Israel and Arab neighbours and the creation of a Palestinian state. We will be working as hard as we possibly can to try to get an agreement so that we can move forward with - not only a renewed but an expanded agreement on hostages - and all the benefits that that would bring with it, Blinken said at a news conference in Doha late on Tuesday. Netanyahu has rejected a Palestinian state, which Saudi Arabia, the biggest prize in Israels quest for acceptance from Middle East neighbours, says is a requirement of any deal to normalise relations with Israel. The diplomatic push comes at a time of intense combat in Gaza, with Israel pushing to capture the main city in the south of the enclave, Khan Younis, and fighting also resurging in northern areas Israel claimed to have subdued months ago. Last week, Israel said it plans to storm Rafah, the town along the border fence at Gazas southern edge, now crowded with more than half of Gazas population sheltering mainly in public buildings and makeshift tents. Health officials in Rafah said 11 people had been killed in Israeli strikes on the town overnight, causing panic among some of the displaced people there who fear it could be the start of an Israeli assault on the area. The Israeli military said it had killed dozens of militants in fighting over the past 24 hours. It has made similar claims throughout the fighting in Khan Younis, which could not be independently verified. Source - Reuters - Agencies",

        "date": "February 7, 2024 04:37 pm",
        "content": "The United Nations International Childrens Emergency Fund (UNICEF) states that it welcomes the long-awaited amendment to the Sri Lankas Children and Young Persons Ordinance (CYPO) coming into force effective January 01, 2024, which marks a significant step towards protecting the rights and welfare of all children of the country. The CYPO, a legislation governing justice for children in Sri Lanka since 1939, previously only covered those up to the age of 16. The amendment now extends its protection to all children under the age of 18. Furthermore, the amendment also repeals the section of the CYPO which permitted the use of corporal punishment on children and adolescents by parents, teachers, or guardians. Issuing a statement in this regard, the UNICEF expresses that these amendments contribute to the alignment of Sri Lankas laws that address childrens rights with international standards, particularly the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC), but also addresses the evolving needs and challenges faced by children and adolescents in the country. UNICEF Representative in Sri Lanka, Christian Skoog said, The operationalization of the amended CYPO marks a significant milestone for child rights in Sri Lanka, ensuring a justice system that upholds the rights and dignity of every child. This noteworthy progress also underscores the importance a comprehensive ban on corporal punishment in all settings including homes and schools, as we strive to create safer and nurturing environments for every child in Sri Lanka. These amendments further signify a paradigm shift in the treatment of children in conflict with the law. Previously, children between ages of 16 -18 years who committed offenses were placed in adult prisons, lacking appropriate rehabilitation and care. With the amended CYPO now in effect, such children will receive rehabilitation under the supervision of the Provincial Departments of Probation and Child Care, emphasizing a rehabilitative rather than punitive approach. The CRC however notes that the detention of a child should only be a last resort, and for the shortest period, as evidence shows that institutionalization could hinder a childs development and reintegration, leading to perpetuating cycles of violence and poverty, the UNICEF added. For juvenile offenders, UNICEF calls upon stakeholders in the justice, probation and child-care sectors to prioritize the application of non-custodial measures such as family-based rehabilitation, as they are more effective and protective of children, the statement mentioned. Meanwhile, it also pointed out that the UNICEFs support for this amendment is rooted in its longstanding commitment to advocating for the rights of children worldwide. A 2023 UNICEF study on Sri Lankas justice system for children highlighted important data gaps and the urgent need for reforms to ensure the adequacy and effectiveness of legal protection for children. The UNICEF further said the amendment to the CYPO represents a key step towards addressing these recommendations and building a justice system that prioritizes the best interests of the child. The Government of Sri Lankas decision to operationalize CYPO amendments underscores its commitment to fulfilling its obligations under international law and prioritizing the well-being of its youngest citizens. UNICEF, with support from the European Union, is working with the Ministry of Justice and other partners to strengthen inclusive access to justice, improve transparency and accountability in the sector as well as enhance quality and efficient services delivery, it added.",

        "content": "State Minister of Primary Industries, Chamara Sampath Dassanayake, announced plans to unlock significant economic potential from the 5,000 acres of land owned by Sri Lanka Cement Corporation. The initiative aims to generate USD 300 million annually, bolstering the nations economy and demonstrating efficient resource utilization, the Presidents Media Division (PMD) reported. The State Minister also stressed the imperative of leveraging our nations available resources to propel its development, regardless of any challenges that may arise, emphasizing the need to build the country steadfastly. The announcement was made during a press briefing titled Collective Path to a Stable Country, held at the Presidents Media Centre (PMC) today (07 Feb.). While specific details about the chosen organization and the planned development remain unavailable, the initiative signifies a significant step towards economic growth and resource optimization. In his address, the State Minister acknowledged the challenges inherited upon taking office, including struggling institutions within his ministry. He emphasized the success in revitalizing the Gem and Jewellery Authority, showcasing a significant increase in annual revenue from USD 280 million to USD 480 million. He further commended the revival of the Walachchenai Paper Factory, highlighting its current ability to sustain operations and employee salaries despite not yet achieving profitability. While our phosphate company possesses valuable mineral resources estimated at Rs. 24 million, legal challenges from NGOs currently prevent us from profiting from them. Despite this hurdle, we successfully generated income through phosphate sales, enabling us to cover all loans, fulfil salary payments, and contribute Rs. 350 million to the Treasury. Similarly, we generated profit from salt mines in Elephant Pass and Mannar, further contributing Rs. 100 million to the Treasury. These examples demonstrate the potential of utilizing our nations resources for economic benefit. However, challenges such as legal cases against phosphate exports can arise. While these obstacles exist, we must not be discouraged. Giving up on resource utilization due to difficulties would be a disservice to our struggling nation. In these times, maximizing the potential of our resources becomes even more crucial, the State Minister further explained. The Sri Lanka Cement Corporation, currently holding 5,000 acres of land rich in mineral resources, is on the verge of being restructured. With arrangements in place to develop it, the corporation is expected to generate revenue of around USD 300 million annually, making a significant contribution to the nations economy. An institution has already been selected to propose a plan for this transformation. Furthermore, the tourism industry in Ella is thriving, attracting 3,000 visitors daily. This shows a vast potential for tourism growth across the country, which can be harnessed to further development. State Minister Dassanayake further emphasized the importance of capitalizing on these opportunities for the betterment of Sri Lanka.",

It was not immediately known what time the helicopter left Creech nor what time they were due to arrive. Waves of heavy downpours hit the area throughout the night and snow was forecast for San Diego County mountains. The five U.S. Marines were assigned to Marine Heavy Helicopter Squadron 361, Marine Aircraft Group 16, 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing at Miramar, the Marine Corps said in a statement. The San Diego County Sheriffs Department was notified at 1 a.m. that the craft was overdue for arrival at Miramar and was last seen in the area of Pine Valley, a mountainous region near the Cleveland National Forest about 35 miles (56 kilometers) east of downtown San Diego, Lt. Matthew Carpenter said. The military was coordinating search and rescue efforts with the San Diego County Sheriffs Department and the Civil Air Patrol, the Marine Corps said. Calls to the public affairs office were not answered Wednesday morning and no further details were provided in the statement. The National Weather Service in San Diego called for 6 to 10 inches (15 to 25 centimeters) of snow in the mountains above 5,000 feet (1,524 meters) and gusty winds late Wednesday. On Tuesday afternoon a tornado warning was issued but quickly canceled with the weather service saying the storm was not capable of forming a twister. About 99 feet (30 meters) long, the CH-53E Super Stallion is the largest and heaviest helicopter in the military. It can move troops and equipment over rugged terrain in bad weather, including at night, according to the Marine Corps website. It is also nicknamed the hurricane maker because of the amount of downwash generated from its three engines. Two CH-53E helicopters were used in the civil war-torn capital of Mogadishu, Somalia, in January 1990 to rescue American and foreign allies from the U.S. embassy. Source - AP News - Agencies",

        "date": "February 8, 2024 08:42 am",
        "content": "The Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) says it has decided to relax the restrictions imposed on the standing facilities to Licensed Commercial Banks (LCBs) under the Open Market Operations (OMOs). Accordingly, with effect from the reserve maintenance period commencing 16 February 2024, the restriction on the Standing Lending Facility (SLF) will be removed and the restriction on Standing Deposit Facility (SDF) will be relaxed from 5 times to 10 times during a calendar month. This was decided at the special meeting of the Monetary Policy Board held on Wednesday (Feb.07). The CBSL put restrictions on the usage of standing facilities by the LCBs under the OMOs with effect from 16 January 2023. As such, access to the SDF was limited to a maximum of 5 times per calendar month, while access to the SLF was limited to 90 of the Statutory Reserve Requirement (SRR) of each LCB, at any given day. These measures were imposed with the intention of reducing the overdependence of LCBs on the overnight facilities offered by the Central Bank, supporting the reactivation of the domestic money market, particularly the call money market, and inducing LCBs to introduce internal corrective measures. However, the Central Bank has observed that these measures have yielded positive outcomes by way of reactivating the domestic money market and curtailing excessive competition for deposit mobilisation among financial institutions. The Central Bank further said these measures were also instrumental in inducing a moderation in the market interest rate structure in line with the monetary policy stance, while preserving stability of financial institutions and the financial system. On that account, the Monetary Policy Board, at its meeting held on Wednesday, decided to relax the restrictions imposed on the standing facilities to LCBs under OMOs after carefully reviewing the developments in the domestic money market, as well as the behaviour of LCBs in terms of market participation along with the improvements in liquidity. Accordingly, with effect from the reserve maintenance period commencing 16 February 2024, the restriction on the SLF will be removed and the restriction on SDF will be relaxed from 5 times to 10 times during a calendar month. The relaxation of the restrictions on the standing facilities is expected to accelerate the downward adjustments in market interest rates as envisaged under the overall monetary policy direction of the Central Bank.",

The arrest was made by the WesternNorth Crimes Division during a late-night operation conducted yesterday. The suspect is reportedly a resident of Mullegama in Homagama. The T-56 rifle supposedly used by the perpetrators was recovered from the possession of the 30-year-old suspect, in addition to a live grenade, pistol, 3 magazines, 15 grams of heroin, 19 rounds of live ammunition, a motorcycle with a fake registration plate, remote switch of the car used in the shooting and a mobile phone. Preliminary investigations revealed that he was directly involved in multiple criminal activities and drug syndicates run by two members of organized criminal gangs, currently living abroad. A group of four assailants, who had arrived in a car, shot dead a Buddhist monk inside a temple in the Malwathuhiripitiya area of Gampaha in the early hours of January 23. The 45-year-old Buddhist monk, Ven. Kalapaluwawe Dhammarathana Thero, who sustained critical injuries in the incident, had been rushed to the Gampaha Hospital.

        "content": "Pakistan temporarily suspended mobile phone services on Thursday to strengthen security as voting began in the countrys national election, the interior ministry said. The governments decision comes amidst a rise in militant attacks in the run-up to the election and a day after jailed former Prime Minister Imran Khan urged his supporters to wait outside polling booths after voting until results are announced. As a result of the recent incidents of terrorism in the country precious lives have been lost, security measures are essential to maintain the law and order situation and deal with possible threats, hence the temporary suspension of mobile services across the country, the interior ministry said in a message on X. Two blasts near election offices on Wednesday killed 26 people in the southwestern province of Balochistan. Islamic State claimed responsibility for the blasts in a message on its Telegram channel. Several other groups, including the Islamist Pakistani Taliban (TTP) and separatist Baloch militants oppose the Pakistani state and have also carried out attacks in recent months. The country is on high alert with tens of thousands of troops and paramilitary soldiers on duty across the country, including at polling stations. Pakistan also said it was closing its borders with Iran and Afghanistan for the day for security purposes. Unofficial first results in the election are expected a few hours after voting closes at 5 p.m. (1200 GMT) and a clear picture is likely to emerge early on Friday. The main contests are expected to be between candidates backed by Khan, whose Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party won the last national election, and the Pakistan Muslim League (PML-N) of three-time premier Nawaz Sharif, who is considered the front-runner. Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, the 35-year-old son of former premier Benazir Bhutto, has also run an aggressive campaign in an outside bid for the top office. Analysts say there may be no clear winner but Pakistans powerful generals could play a role. Pakistans military has dominated the nuclear-armed country either directly or indirectly in its 76 years of independence but for several years it has maintained it does not interfere in politics. The deciding factor is which side the powerful military and its security agencies are on, said Abbas Nasir, a columnist. Only a huge turnout in favour of PTI can change its fortunes. SWITCHED PLACES Khan believes the military is behind a crackdown to hound his party out of existence, while analysts and opponents say Sharif is being backed by the generals. The two former prime ministers have switched places since the last election in 2018: Khan was believed to be backed by the military then and Sharif was in jail on corruption charges. Historically, engineered electoral exercises have not produced stability, Nasir said, adding, Economic challenges are so serious, grave, and the solutions so very painful that I am unsure how anyone who comes to power will steady the ship. If the election does not result in a clear majority for anyone, as analysts are predicting, tackling multiple challenges will be tricky - foremost being seeking a new bailout programme from International Monetary Fund (IMF) after the current one expires in March. Smaller political parties could play a crucial role in the formation of a government that will need 169 seats in the 336-member National Assembly. Voters directly elect 266 members while there are 70 reserved seats - 60 for women and 10 for non-Muslims - allotted according to the number of seats won by each party. Independents, many of whom are being backed by Khan, are free to join any party if they win, which could swing fortunes after the vote. Khan has said his candidates will not back Sharif or Bhutto Zardari. Source: Reuters -Agencies",

        "title": "Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu rejects Hamass Gaza ceasefire proposal",
        "date": "February 8, 2024 10:25 am",
        "content": "Israels Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has rejected Hamass proposed ceasefire terms - saying total victory in Gaza is possible within months. He was speaking after Hamas laid out a series of demands in response to an Israel-backed ceasefire proposal. Mr Netanyahu said negotiations with the group were not going anywhere and described their terms as bizarre. Talks are continuing to try to reach some sort of deal. There is no other solution but a complete and final victory, Mr Netanyahu told a news conference on Wednesday. If Hamas will survive in Gaza, its only a question of time until the next massacre. Israel was expected to take issue with Hamass counter-offer, but this response is a categorical rebuke, and Israeli officials clearly see an effort by Hamas to end the war on its terms as utterly unacceptable. Senior Hamas official Sami Abu Zuhri told the Reuters news agency that Mr Netanyahus remarks are a form of political bravado, and show he intends to pursue the conflict in the region. An Egyptian official source told the BBC that a new round of negotiations, mediated by Egypt and Qatar, is still expected to go ahead on Thursday in Cairo. Egypt has called on all parties to show the necessary flexibility to reach a calm agreement, the source said. And Mr Netanyahus rejection of a delusional plan are in stark contrast to remarks from Qatar, which described Hamass response as positive. Hamas put forward its counter-offer to a ceasefire proposal on Tuesday. A draft of the Hamas document seen by Reuters news agency listed these terms:  Phase one: A 45-day pause in fighting during which all Israeli women hostages, males under 19, the elderly and sick would be exchanged for Palestinian women and children held in Israeli jails. Israeli forces would withdraw from populated areas of Gaza, and the reconstruction of hospitals and refugee camps would begin.  Phase two: Remaining male Israeli hostages would be exchanged for Palestinian prisoners and Israeli forces leave Gaza completely.  Phase three: Both sides would exchange remains and bodies. The proposed deal would also see deliveries of food and other aid to Gaza increase. By the end of the 135-day pause in fighting, Hamas said negotiations to end the war would have concluded. Around 1,300 people were killed during the Hamas attacks on southern Israel on 7 October last year. More than 27,700 Palestinians have been killed and at least 65,000 injured by the war launched by Israel in response, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Israeli forces to push into Rafah Mr Netanyahu also confirmed on Wednesday that Israeli forces have been ordered to prepare to operate in the southern Gaza city of Rafah - where tens of thousands of Palestinians have fled in order to escape the fighting. Expanding the conflict into Rafah would exponentially increase what is already a humanitarian nightmare in the city, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned. We are afraid of the invasion of Rafah, one displaced person at the Rafah Crossing, near the border with Egypt, told BBC Arabic. We sleep in fear and sit with fear. There is no food, and the weather is cold. The Israeli leaders comments are a blow to a sustained push by the US to reach a deal that its top diplomat, Antony Blinken, described as the best path forward - even though he cautioned there was still a lot of work to be done. During a news conference on Wednesday, Mr Blinken said there were some clear non-starters in Hamas counter-proposal. But, he added: We do think it creates space for an agreement to be reached, and we will work at that relentlessly till we get there. Sharone Lifshitz, whose parents were among those kidnapped in southern Israel on 7 October and taken to Gaza, told the BBCs Newshour programme that Mr Netanyahus rejection of the Hamas ceasefire terms was almost certainly a death sentence to more hostages. Ms Lifshitzs 85-year-old mother, Yocheved, was subsequently released but her father, Oded, remains in captivity. My own father is 83, hes frail, he cannot last longer, she said. I dont know if the prime minister thinks about him, or if he already accounts for him as somebody who would return in a coffin. Mr Netanyahus stance also highlights the continuing, fundamental mismatch between the US and Israels plans for Gazas future. He is insisting on an entity where Israel maintains overall security control, and Gaza is run by local bodies with no connection to Hamas or any other group. Washingtons vision of the future includes a horizon with a Palestinian state. The urgent question now is whether something can be salvaged to keep these talks going to achieve another exchange of hostages and prisoners, and a desperately needed humanitarian pause, to allow more aid into the Gaza Strip.

        "content": "The Sri Lanka Navy, together with the Sri Lanka Coast Guard have seized 02 Indian trawlers and apprehended 19 Indian fishermen poaching in Sri Lankan waters near Delft Island, Jaffna last night (Feb. 07). The Northern Naval Command of Sri Lanka Navy had deployed Fast Attack Craft and Coast Guard to chase away a cluster of Indian poaching trawlers, having spotted them engaging in illegal fishing in Sri Lankan waters close to the Delft Island in the dark hours on Wednesday. Two poaching trawlers carrying 19 fishermen were apprehended as they continued to remain in Sri Lankan waters, the Navy said. The seized trawlers, together with the 19 fishermen, have been brought to the Kankesanturai Harbour and they will be handed over to the Mailadi Fisheries Inspector for onward legal proceedings, according to the Navy. With the new development, the Navy has held 12 Indian poaching trawlers and 88 Indian fishermen in island waters thus far in 2024 and handed them over to authorities for legal action. Meanwhile on Tuesday, Jaffna court released six Indian fishermen who were arrested on January 22 on charges of trespassing, poaching and using banned fishing nets in Sri Lankan waters and handed them over to the Indian consulate general in Jaffna. The judge ordered their release on the condition that they should not enter Sri Lankan waters. Against this backdrop, Rameswaram fishermen went on strike on Monday (05) after 23 fishermen were arrested by the Sri Lankan navy on February 03, the Indian media had reported. They demanded that the Tamil Nadu government and the Central Government secure the release of 23 fishermen and 150 boats in Sri Lankan custody. Nevertheless, the Sri Lanka Navy says it will continue to conduct regular patrols and operations in Sri Lankan waters to curb illegal fishing practices of foreign fishing trawlers, taking into account the impact of those practices on the livelihood of local fishermen.",

        "content": "Sri Lanka is hopeful of making progress by next month on two delayed wind energy projects to be built by Indias Adani Green Energy Ltd, its energy minister said on Wednesday. The cash-strapped south Asian island nation, which has suffered from crippling power blackouts and fuel shortages, has been trying to speed green power generation to hedge against surges in imported fuel costs, but the wind projects are still being evaluated because of disputes over pricing and plant efficiency. Maybe in the next four weeks, we will see some results on the negotiation process, and there is another negotiation for the transmission lines that is also being evaluated, Energy Minister Kanchana Wijesekera told Reuters in an interview on the sidelines of the India Energy Week event in Goa. Both are (happening) simultaneously, so I am hopeful that by March, we will have something, he said. Adani, which won approvals to invest 442 million in the wind projects in February 2023, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Hydropower, coal-fired plants and oil-based power plants each account for nearly a third of the countrys electricity output. The government has committed to not add any new coal-based capacity and aims to produce 70 of its electricity from renewable sources by 2030. Neighbouring India recently proposed supplying liquefied natural gas (LNG) to help Sri Lanka produce power at two plants, and Wijesekera said Indias state-run Petronet LNG and plant officials were working out the mechanics on shipping LNG. It is positively progressing. We should have something maybe in the next three to four weeks, he said. In November, Sri Lanka approved a proposal by Chinas Sinopec to build a 4.5 billion oil refinery in Hambantota, where China built a port. Wijesekera said the contract has been awarded and the government had made clarifications Sinopec had sought on land clearance, water availability, taxes and concessions. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "date": "February 8, 2024 02:32 pm",
        "content": "A senior commander of an Iran-backed militia has been killed in a US drone strike in Baghdad. A leader of Kataib Hezbollah and two of his guards were in a vehicle when it was targeted in the east of the Iraqi capital. All three of them died. The Pentagon said the commander was responsible for directing attacks on American forces in the region. The US has linked the militia to a drone attack in Jordan that killed three US troops last month. In the wake of that attack, Kataib Hezbollah said it was suspending attacks on American troops to prevent embarrassment to the Iraqi government. Wednesday nights drone raid happened in Baghdads Mashtal neighbourhood, sparking several loud explosions. It was a precise strike on a moving vehicle in a busy street and the car was reduced to a fiery wreck. One of the victims has been identified as Abu Baqir al-Saadi, a senior commander in Kataib Hezbollah. US Central Command (Centcom) said the attack at 21:30 local time (18:30 GMT) had killed the commander responsible for directly planning and participating in attacks on US forces in the region. There are no indications of collateral damage or civilian casualties at this time, the Centcom statement said. When a BBC team reached the scene, crowds of protesters gathered chanting: America is the biggest devil. There was a heavy police presence, joined by Swat teams from Iraqs interior ministry. The BBC team tried to get close to the burnt-out vehicle, but was driven back by onlookers who said journalists were not welcome. You are foreigners, one man shouted, adding and foreigners are to blame for this. The raid comes days after the US launched 85 strikes in the Iraq-Syria border area in retaliation for the fatal 28 January drone attack on American troops at a base in Jordan. President Joe Biden described last Fridays wave of attacks as just the beginning of the US response. The drone raid in the Iraqi capital will be seen as a major escalation. But it was perhaps inevitable that the American strategy would include targeting not only infrastructure used by the groups, but also their senior leaders. Shortly after Wednesdays attack, militias in the country called for retaliation against the US. Harakat al Nujaba - another group blamed for attacks against American troops - released a statement promising a targeted retaliation, adding that these crimes will not go unpunished, according to AFP. On 4 January, the US launched an airstrike in Baghdad that killed a senior leader of Harakat al Nujaba. American forces have been hit with more than 165 rocket and drone strikes since the Israel Gaza war began on 7 October. The US has some 2,500 troops in Iraq and 900 in neighbouring Syria in a mission to combat the Islamic State terror group, says the Pentagon. The American military has also recently launched attacks against the Iran-aligned Houthi group in Yemen, in response to attacks against commercial ships in the Red Sea. Source: BBC -Agencies",

        "date": "February 8, 2024 03:29 pm",
        "content": "Sri Lanka currently has the highest electricity charges in South Asia, with households paying 2.5 to 3 times more for electricity than the average price paid by households in other South Asian countries, according to analysis that was published this week. Published on PublicFinance.lk, Sri Lankas premier economic insights platform, this analysis by Verité Research looked at what households are charged for their electricity when consuming 100, 200 or 300 units, at the start of 2024. The calculation only took into account the charges of the supplier, and did not include government taxes such as the Social Security Levy, which is charged additionally in Sri Lanka. The second highest household electricity charges in the region are in Pakistan; yet they are far less than in Sri Lanka. Households consuming 100 units are charged 50 more in Sri Lanka than Pakistan; and those consuming 300 units are charged 97 more in Sri Lanka. Increases in Sri Lankas electricity charges have come in the wake of a commitment made by Sri Lanka on its International Monetary Fund (IMF) programme, that Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) will recover its full costs from the combination of charges levied on consumers, and any subsidies received from the Treasury. A tariff decrease is planned for this month (February 2024) which would reduce the electricity charges by 4 or less. That decrease is too small to have a material impact. Sri Lankan households will continue to pay the highest prices for electricity, by far, in the South Asian region.",

        "date": "February 8, 2024 03:46 pm",
        "content": "(Reuters) - Australians on Thursday cheered new proposed laws that give workers the right to ignore calls and messages from their bosses outside of work hours, but some business leaders slammed it as overreach. The right to disconnect is part of a raft of changes to industrial relations laws proposed by the federal government under a parliamentary bill introduced in parliament. The bill was passed in the Senate on Thursday but will need to go back to the House of Representatives to vote to approve some amendments. I think its a wonderful idea, said Sydney resident Colvin Macpherson. We all need to relax, we all need to be able to switch off and not be disturbed by emails and phone calls in the middle of the night. Both of my kids are lawyers as well, so they work horrendous hours as it is and you get things coming in at night time, he said. Similar laws giving employees a right to switch off their devices are already in place in France, Germany and other countries in the European Union. The bill also includes other provisions like a clearer pathway from temporary to permanent work and minimum standards for temporary workers and truck driver. In general, I think the idea that you should be able to switch off when you get to the end of your work day and when you are at home doing your own thing over the weekend or on leave, that seems like a generally reasonable thing to me, said another Sydney resident Ivan Karajas. However, a joint statement from Australias chambers of commerce urged the Senate to carefully reconsider the implications of what it called a rushed and flawed legislation. Modern technology has provided flexibility to the workforce and many employees no longer need to sit behind a desk from nine to five, the statement said. We cannot allow industrial relations laws to make it harder for hard-working business owners to generate the wealth we enjoy as a nation. Bran Black, the chief executive of the Business Council of Australia, told reporters in Canberra that the provisions were anti-business and come at a time when Australia can least afford it. Business is not opposed to the idea that people should be able to switch off, I know I like to switch off... but you need to be able to make sure that you get these policies right in terms of how theyre implemented and the type of consultation that is required to do that, Black said.

        "content": "A federal judge on Wednesday dismissed a lawsuit accusing Apple of overpaying Chief Executive Tim Cook and other top executives by tens of millions of dollars by miscalculating the value of performance-based stock awards. U.S. District Judge Jennifer Rochon in Manhattan said the iPhone maker described its pay methods in detailed compensation tables in its 2023 proxy statement, precisely as securities laws and U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission rules require. Rochon also found no proof that Apples board of directors acted improperly in awarding pay, and said the plaintiff, a pension fund affiliated with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, did not give the board enough time to consider its objections before suing. Lawyers for the pension fund did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The plaintiff said Apple in 2021 and 2022 awarded a respective 92.7 million and 94 million of performance-based restricted stock units to Cook and four other executives, though its compensation committee intended to award just 77.5 million each year. It attributed the alleged error to the committees improper calculation of the RSUs fair values at the time of the grants, and said it misled shareholders who would be casting advisory votes on executive compensation, known as say-on-pay. Cooks compensation, totaled about 99 million in both 2021 and 2022, including more than 82 million of stock awards each year, Apple proxy filings show. His total pay declined to 63.2 million for 2023. The four other Apple executives were each awarded more than 26 million in each of the three years.

        "date": "February 8, 2024 05:00 pm",
        "content": "The world just experienced its hottest January on record, continuing a run of exceptional heat fuelled by climate change, the European Unions Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) said on Thursday. Last month surpassed the previous warmest January, which occurred in 2020, in C3Ss records going back to 1950. The exceptional month came after 2023 ranked as the planets hottest year in global records going back to 1850, as human-caused climate change and the El Nino weather phenomenon, which warms the surface waters in the eastern Pacific Ocean, pushed temperatures higher. Every month since June has been the worlds hottest on record, compared with the corresponding month in previous years. Not only is it the warmest January on record but we have also just experienced a 12-month period of more than 1.5 C (1.7 F) above the pre-industrial reference period, C3S Deputy Director Samantha Burgess said. Rapid reductions in greenhouse gas emissions are the only way to stop global temperatures increasing, she said. U.S. scientists have said 2024 has a one-in-three chance of being even hotter than last year, and a 99 chance of ranking in the top five warmest years. The El Nino phenomenon began to weaken last month, and scientists, opens new tab have indicated it could shift to the cooler La Nina counterpart later this year. Still, average global sea surface temperatures last month were the highest for any January on record. Countries agreed in the 2015 Paris Agreement to try to prevent global warming surpassing 1.5 degrees Celsius, to avoid it unleashing more severe and irreversible consequences. Despite exceeding 1.5 C in a 12-month period, the world has not yet breached the Paris Agreement target, which refers to an average global temperature over decades. Some scientists have said the goal can no longer realistically be met, but have urged governments to act faster to cut CO2 emissions to limit overshooting the target - and the deadly heat, drought and rising seas that this would inflict on people and ecosystems - as much as possible.

        "title": "India to begin LNG supplies to Sri Lanka in 2025",
        "date": "February 8, 2024 08:42 pm",
        "content": "Petronet LNG Ltd, Indias biggest liquefied natural gas company, will in 2025 start supplying LNG to Sri Lanka, initially in containers loaded on ships and later going on to build an import terminal, its chief executive said on Thursday. Sri Lanka is seeking supply of gas in liquid form to meet requirements for generating electricity and other industries. It was in discussions with Petronet and other suppliers for years and it is only now that it has finally agreed to buy the fuel from the Indian firm. Petronet CEO Akshay Kumar Singh said the company will ship 850 tonnes of gas daily to the island nation in containers of 17 tonnes each. The supplies would be for five years during which the company will build a floating LNG receipt facility at Colombo port. The supplies will start in 18 months or so, he said. The Indian firm imports LNG from Qatar, Australia and other countries at two terminals - Dahej terminal in Gujarat and a facility at Kochi in Kerala. It plans to load LNG or super-chilled gas in containers from Kochi in containers. A ship will make a ferry every two days, carrying 100 such containers. At Colombo, a small regasification unit will turn the LNG into gaseous state again for use in gas-fired power plants. Speaking to reporters on the sidelines of India Energy Week, Singh said Petronet also plans to commission a floating storage regasification unit (FSRU) in Colombo, for which it hopes to get Sri Lankan government approval by 2025. The facility will be built by 2028. We have not finalised the investment plan but it may roughly cost Rs 2,500 crore, he said adding the company will do a detailed feasibility report once the Sri Lankan government approves FRSU proposal. Singh said Petronet, which earlier this week extended a 7.5 million tonnes a year LNG import deal with Qatar for another 20 years beyond 2028, is looking at sourcing more gas, including on long term contracts. It is expanding the Dahej facility from 17.5 million tonnes per annum to 22.5 million tonnes and is looking to build a new terminal in Odisha. Also, its 5 million tonnes a year Kochi facility will by next year start operating at full capacity after a pipeline taking the gas to consumers in Bengaluru gets commissioned. Kochi is currently operating at a fifth of its capacity, he said. So naturally, there will be a requirement for more gas, he said but refused to say how many long-term contracts the company is looking to tie up. We need more long-term deals. It is a country requirement. Besides 7.5 million tonnes from Qatar, LNG is also imported from the Gorgon project in Australia. Currently, 1.44 million tonnes a year of LNG is imported, which will rise by 1.2 million tonnes between 2025-26 to 2028, he said. Earlier at the same event Sri Lanka Energy Minister Kanchana Wijesekera told Reuters that Petronet and Sri Lanka power plant officials were working out the mechanics on shipping LNG to the country. The Indian economy is expanding at a world-beating pace and it needs energy supplies to meet its needs. Natural gas is considered a transition fuel to net zero carbon emissions. The government is targeting raising the share of natural gas in the primary energy basket to 15 per cent by 2030 from the current 6.2 per cent. With domestic production hardly meeting half of the demand, the fuel is imported in the form of LNG. --With agencies inputs",

        "date": "February 8, 2024 09:33 pm",
        "content": "Loneliness has been declared a public health emergency in a Californian county that includes part of Silicon Valley. San Mateo County is the first in the US to make such a declaration. About 17 of US adults questioned by Gallup in February last year said they had experienced loneliness the day before. In San Mateo, however, about 45 of residents are struggling with isolation, according to David Canepa from the countys board of supervisors. Across the US there is an epidemic of loneliness and isolation, US Surgeon General Dr Vivek Murthy has said. It is an underappreciated public health crisis which has harmed individual and societal health, he added. Concerns in San Mateo are not confined to one demographic, Mr Canepa said. Teenagers and young adults spend a long time on social media, he pointed out, while Silicon Valleys high-achieving atmosphere may put stress on those still in education. Many older residents became especially isolated during the pandemic, he added. Perfect storm Its sort of a perfect storm for older adults right now, said Jennifer Steele, CEO of Meals on Wheels San Francisco. People dont live close to their loved ones anymore. Sometimes people have outlived their loved ones. Your social circle shrinks after retirement, she added. Its harder for people to make friends. Were often the only people they may see in a week. Mr Canepa said the decision to declare a crisis was influenced by the UK and Japan, where ministers for loneliness, a condition that has been linked to heart disease, strokes and Alzheimers disease, have been introduced. May strategy In 2016 the then prime minister, Theresa May, introduced the first cross-government strategy to tackle loneliness. At the time, three-quarters of GPs said in a survey they were seeing between one and five people a day who were feeling isolated. Mr Canepa has written to Gavin Newsom, the governor of California, calling for a state-wide minister for loneliness. There are several ideas to improve social connections in San Mateo, including changes to infrastructure to make it easier to walk around neighbourhoods, and partnering with social media platforms based in the state to encourage residents to join community groups.

Sri Lanka facilitated visa-free entry for Indian travellers from December 2023 to March. We are working on extending it beyond March. We want to make Sri Lanka an easily accessible destination for Indians, who can just walk into our country for a hassle free holiday, he said. By offering visa exemption to Indians, Sri Lanka will attract more footfalls, especially those who make last-minute plans and find visa process a hindrance, he said. In the time of more options, we have to ease the travel process to encourage more tourists from India and repeat footfalls, he added. Indonesias Deputy Minister of Marketing, Ministry of Tourism and Creative Economy, Ni Made Ayu Marthini said the country had given visa-free status to 169 countries, but this was suspended due to the pandemic. However, we have begun opening visa exemptions for a few countries. However, we are working on extending this and India is on the top of the list of countries. I hope we will be able to grant India visa status, she added. India is the number two source for Bali, and for overall footfalls of the country, India is number six and with such a huge population, it provides a large market with great potential, she added. The 3-day OTM has more than 1,600 exhibitors participating from 60 countries and 30 Indian states and Union Territories connecting with over 35,000 industry professionals and buyers.

        "date": "February 8, 2024 10:28 pm",
        "content": "Relations between Saudi Arabia and Sri Lanka are based on common values, mutual respect, support and non interference according to Colombos ambassador in Riyadh, Pakeer Mohideen Amza. Speaking at a reception on the 76th anniversary of Sri Lankas Independence, he said: Sri Lanka-Saudi Arabia relations date back to several centuries. Sri Lanka was a pivotal point in the historic silk route which was used extensively by the Arab traders. In ancient times Arabs called Sri Lanka Serendip, which later added to the English vocabulary as serendipity. The ambassador said the Sri Lankan leadership had on numerous occasions expressed admiration for Saudi Vision 2030, which he said was a well-thought-out strategy that takes into consideration the Kingdoms strengths and capabilities, as well as the impressive progress that has been made under the leadership of King Salman and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Sri Lanka is pleased that Riyadh will host Expo 2030, which Colombo was among the first to support, he added. Amza noted that the past two years have been extremely productive for relations between the two states. In March 2022 Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan visited Sri Lanka. This was the first ever bilateral foreign ministerial visit from the Kingdom to Sri Lanka, ever since we established diplomatic relations in 1974, Amza said. Subsequently, Ali Sabry, Sri Lankas minister of foreign affairs, visited Saudi Arabia early last year. The past two years have also witnessed nearly a dozen ministerial visits from Colombo to Riyadh and vice versa, the last being the visit by Saudi Minister of Economy and Planning Faisal Al-Ibrahim in November 2023 which helped to draw a road map for future economic cooperation between the two countries. Both countries have also inked three agreements covering avoidance of double taxation, foreign employment and political consultation in the past year. The first session of the joint commission between the two countries was held in Riyadh in May 2023 during which 63 areas covering trade, industry, investment, energy, finance, economy, transport, communication, agriculture, education, health, sports, culture , tourism, security, judicial and labor were identified for further cooperation, said the ambassador. Last year also saw an increase in employment opportunities for Sri Lankans in Saudi Arabia, with the Kingdom generating 63,000 posts for Sri Lankans, he added. Of the annual remittances to Sri Lanka amounting to 7-8 billion a year, 15 to 20 percent has been generated by the Sri Lankans living in the Kingdom, said Amza. The number of Saudi nationals visiting Sri Lanka is gaining momentum as well, following several tourism events held with the active participation of numerous tour operators, including the official launch of the Ibn Battuta Trail Travel Package, tracing the path of the 14th century traveler, he added. The ambassador extended greetings to fellow Sri Lankan nationals living in Saudi Arabia. Our post-independence journey had ups and downs, like any other country. We have had challenges and opportunities. Thankfully the path of our recovery is steady and encouraging. Sri Lankas inflation, which was 70 percent in September 2022, has now come down to 5 percent. The rupee has stabilized. Remittances have seen a 60 percent increase year-on-year from 2022-2023. Tourism has seen an annual growth of 106 percent in the year 2023 (and) our reserves, which were at 20 million in April 2022, have risen to 4.5 billion by January 2024. The reception was attended by senior Saudi officials, diplomats, entrepreneurs and members of the Sri Lankan community in the Kingdom. Source - Arab News --Agencies",

        "title": "Sri Lanka earned 3mn from resuming bunkering system - State Minister",
        "date": "February 9, 2024 06:13 am",
        "content": "State Minister of Power and Energy, D.V. Chanaka, says Sri Lanka has generated a revenue of USD 3 million through the sale of 5,200 MT of fuel via the revived bunkering system for vessels. This signifies a significant step forward in stabilizing the countrys energy finances, he added. Furthermore, the lawmaker emphasized the establishment of a USD 200 million buffer stock. According to him, this prudent measure demonstrates proactive planning to mitigate future economic fluctuations and ensure energy security. Acknowledging the past economic struggles, he referenced the time when Sri Lanka faced fuel shortages and long queues. He, however, highlighted the nations gradual progress achieved through collective efforts. Commending everyone involved for their dedication, he attributed the current stability in oil supply to their collaboration. The State Minister proudly announced that Sri Lanka currently holds the largest oil reserves in its recent history, signifying a significant improvement in fuel security and preparedness. Additionally, he reassured the public about the maintenance of a balanced petroleum legal corporation dollar system, suggesting responsible financial management within the sector. The Sri Lankan government is taking proactive measures to ensure energy security and navigate global oil price fluctuations. The State Minister recently addressed the nation with these promising updates. Firstly, the government is building a USD 200 million buffer stock to safeguard against potential economic shocks. This demonstrates their commitment to future energy security. Additionally, they maintain a weekly supply of dollars to meet immediate needs, signifying responsible financial management. The State Minister proudly announced the current fuel stock exceeding 75,410 tons, encompassing various types of fuel for vehicles, aviation, and power generation as, as 130,791 MT of Auto Diesel, 83,275 MT of Petrol 92, 8313 MT of Super Diesel, 11,196 MT of Petrol 95, 17,274 MT of Jet A1 used for aircraft and 17,274 MT of Fuel Oil (FO) for power generation. This achievement stems from securing long-term contracts through tender procedures, guaranteeing a steady supply for the next six months. He acknowledged the seasonal rise in global oil prices due to winter in Europe, but expressed optimism for a decrease after March. The government intends to utilize this anticipated price drop to benefit consumers. The State Minister also highlighted the elimination of late payment fees since 2023, achieved by strategically storing ships upon arrival and making timely purchases using available dollars. Overall, the Sri Lankan governments proactive measures and understanding of global trends paint a positive picture for the countrys energy sector, according to him. They are focusing on financial stability, long-term fuel security, and seeking ways to alleviate the burden of fluctuating oil prices on consumers. The State Minister, outlined several positive developments in Sri Lankas oil procurement strategies: Prior to 2023, Sri Lanka incurred annual late fees on oil purchases. However, a new system implemented last year stores arriving ships until payment is secured, eliminating these fees for the first time in 15 years. To further optimize pricing and reduce costs, the traditional tender method for oil procurement is being transitioned to an auction system. Nearly complete (95 implemented), this initiative leverages expertise from the oil storage terminal for effective execution. Sri Lanka is exploring new technologies to decrease procurement fees further. Additionally, the premium paid on oil has seen a significant reduction, dropping from 22 in 2022 to 5-3 in 2023. After a two-year gap, the bunkering system allowing ships to refuel was restarted in 2024. This generated USD 3 million in revenue by selling fuel oil used for electricity production. Plans are underway to expand this service by providing diesel to vessels soon. --PMD",

        "content": "A volcano began erupting in southwestern Iceland early Thursday, sending lava jets as high as 80 meters, the countrys weather office said. At 5:30 this morning an intense seismic activity started north-east of Mt. Sýlingarfell. Around 30 minutes later, a volcanic eruption started at the site, the Icelandic Met Office said. Images taken by an Icelandic Coast Guard surveillance flight appeared to show the eruption taking place at a location near the Dec. 18 eruption, official said. Another eruption nearby on Jan. 14 sent lava flowing into Grindavik, a small town that had been evacuated prior to the eruption. The latest eruption began at about 6 a.m. local time on Thursday, after a series of earthquakes rumbled the region for a half-hour, Met officials said. The fissure was about 3 km long, stretching from Mount Sundhnúkur towards the eastern part of Mount Stóra-Skógfell, the office said. Lava flows mostly towards west at the moment and the flow seems to be slightly less than at the start of the 18th of December eruption, the office said. It wasnt immediately clear if the town of Grindavik, where homes had been destroyed by the most recent eruption, was at risk from Tuesdays fissure. But it appeared it may be spared, a local politician said. This time a bit further North than December eruption and further away from town of Grindavik, Gisli Olafsson, an MP, said on social media. The nearby geothermal spa Blue Lagoon had closed on Thursday, according to its website. President Guðni Th. Jóhannesson posted a photo of billowing smoke, saying it was the view outside my residence as I woke up this morning. He said flight to and from Iceland had not been affected by Thursdays eruption. As before, our thoughts are with the people of Grindavík who cannot reside in their beautiful town, he said. This too shall pass. Source: ABC News -Agencies",

        "date": "February 9, 2024 12:58 pm",
        "content": "An Indian state has approved an unprecedented uniform code for marriage, divorce, adoption and inheritance for Hindus, Muslims and other religious communities under new legislation that also requires couples that live together to register with the government or face punishment. Northern Uttarakhand state lawmakers passed the legislation on Wednesday and its approval by the state governor and the Indian president is seen as a formality before it becomes law in the state. Muslim leaders and others oppose the Uniform Civil Code initiated by Prime Minister Narendra Modis Hindu Nationalist party saying it interferes with their own laws and customs on such issues. India, the worlds most populous nation with more than 1.4 billion people, is comprised of around 80 Hindus and about 14 Muslims. Muslims accuse Modis right-wing nationalist party of pursuing a Hindu agenda that discriminates against them and directly imposes laws interfering with their faith. This is a nefarious political design to drive a wedge in the society on religious lines, said Yashpal Arya, an opposition Congress party lawmaker. Pushkar Singh Dhami, the top elected official in Uttarakhand state, said: The new legislation is not against any religion or community, but will bring uniformity in the society. Other states ruled by Modis Bharatiya Janata Party are expected to introduce similar legislation. If the BJP wins national elections expected in April or May, it may bring such legislation at the federal level. The new law bans polygamy and sets a uniform age for marriage for men and women  21 and 18, respectively  across all religions and also includes a uniform process for divorce. Hindus, Muslims, Christians and other minority groups in India currently follow their own laws and customs for marriage, divorce, adoption and inheritance. Asaduddin Owaisi, president of the All India Majlis-e-Ittehad-ul-Muslimeen, said the legislation is merely a Hindu code that applies to all. I have a right to practice my religion and culture. This bill forces me to follow a different religion and culture. In our religion, inheritance and marriage are part of religious practice, he said on X, formerly Twitter. S.Q.R. Ilyas, the spokesperson for the All India Muslim Personal Law Board, said: The bill is unnecessary, and goes against the principle of diversity. Its primary target appears to be Muslims, especially since even (some Indigenous tribes) have been exempted. A significant feature of the bill is the introduction of stringent measures that require the registration of live-in relationships. Couples failing to register their live-in status with district officials could face up to six months in prison or a fine of 25,000 rupees (305) or both, said Manoj Singh Tamta, a state government official. He said the bill explicitly states that children born out of such relationships will be considered legitimate offspring of the couple, inheriting all legal rights available to those born within a traditional marriage. Sanjay Agnihotri, a consultant with a non-government organization that works in micro-financing, said he and his girlfriend belong to different castes and their families oppose the idea of them marrying. They relocated to another city and started living as partners without formalizing their relationship through marriage. However, the new legislation mandates us to register our relationship, which could potentially subject us to unwarranted police scrutiny, said Agnihotri. Uttarakhand became the first Indian state after it won independence from British colonialists in 1947 to adopt legislation on marriage, divorce, land, property and inheritance for all citizens, irrespective of their religion, a key part of the BJPs agenda for decades.

        "title": "My memory is fine - President Biden hits back at special counsel",
        "date": "February 9, 2024 01:52 pm",
        "content": "US President Joe Biden has angrily criticised an investigation that found he mishandled top secret files and said he struggled to recall key life events. In a surprise news briefing on Thursday evening, Mr Biden insisted: My memory is fine. He slammed a claim that he could not recollect when his son died, saying: How the hell dare he raise that? The inquiry found Mr Biden wilfully retained and disclosed classified files, but decided not to charge him. Department of Justice Special Counsel Robert Hur determined Mr Biden had improperly kept classified documents related to military and foreign policy in Afghanistan after serving as vice-president. The scathing 345-page report, released earlier in the day, said the presidents memory had significant limitations. Mr Hur interviewed the 81-year-old president over five hours as part of the inquiry. The special counsel, a Republican appointed to the role by Biden attorney general Merrick Garland, said Mr Biden could not recall when he was vice-president (from 2009-2017), or even within several years, when his son Beau died (2015). At Thursday nights news conference, an emotional Mr Biden lashed out at the passages casting doubt on his recollection of events. Frankly, when I was asked the question I thought to myself, was none of their damn business, he said. I dont need anyone to remind me when he Beau Biden passed away. He said he was very occupied... in the middle of handling an international crisis when he was interviewed by the special counsel from 8-9 October last year - just as the Israel-Gaza war erupted. The inquiry also said Mr Biden had shared some of the sensitive material from hand-written notebooks with a ghostwriter for his memoir, a finding that the president denied from the podium. The special counsel concluded it would be difficult to convict the president of improper handling of files because at trial, Mr Biden would likely present himself to a jury, as he did during our interview of him, as a sympathetic, well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory. Opinion polls indicate the presidents age is a concern for US voters ahead of Novembers White House election. But Mr Biden told reporters on Thursday he was the most qualified candidate. I am well-meaning, he said. And am elderly. I know what the hell Im doing. I put this country back on its feet. I dont need his recommendation. However even as he sought to rebut reporters questions about his age and mental acuity, he inadvertently referred Egyptian leader Abdul Fattah al-Sisi as the president of Mexico. Asked to comment on the latest in the Israel-Gaza war, he said: I think as you know initially, the president of Mexico, Sisi, did not want to open up the gate to allow humanitarian material to get in. Asked whether he took responsibility for having classified documents in his home, Mr Biden blamed his staff. He said he didnt know they had put sensitive memos in his garage, where the special counsel says they were located next to a dog bed. A BBC reporter at the White Houses Diplomatic Reception Room described the atmosphere as tense. When one journalist said the American people were concerned about his age, Mr Biden raised his voice in reply: That is your judgement, that is your judgement. He insisted that his memory is fine and has not gotten worse during his presidency. Mr Bidens legal team also criticised the special counsels remarks about Mr Bidens apparent memory lapses. The report uses highly prejudicial language to describe a commonplace occurrence among witnesses: a lack of recall of years-old events, wrote White House lawyer Richard Sauber in a letter attached to the report. The top secret files were found at Mr Bidens house in Wilmington, Delaware, and former private office from 2022-23. The discovery came after a separate investigation charged former President Donald Trump, 77, with mishandling classified documents following his departure from the White House. He faces a trial in that case this May. The Hur report distinguishes between both cases, saying Mr Biden handed over the documents to government archivists, while Mr Trump allegedly did the opposite. According to the indictment, he not only refused to return the documents for many months, but he also obstructed justice by enlisting others to destroy evidence and then to lie about it, the report says about Mr Trump. Mr Trump, in response, said his classified files trial should be cancelled by the justice department prosecutor. If Special Counsel Jack Smith wants to do good for our Country, and help to unify it, he should drop all Litigation against Joe Bidens Political Opponent, ME, and let our Country HEAL, the Republican White House frontrunner posted on his platform, Truth Social.

        "date": "February 9, 2024 04:58 pm",
        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe delivered the keynote speech at the 7th Indian Ocean Conference in Perth, focusing on the theme Towards a Stable and Sustainable Indian Ocean. He highlighted the critical need for enhanced connectivity infrastructure to accommodate the projected eight-fold increase in the GDP of countries like India and Indonesia by 2050. Existing channels like the Suez Canal may not be adequate, necessitating new initiatives. Indias proposed Mumbai-Iran-Russia and Mumbai-Middle East-Europe corridors, along with projects in the Bay of Bengal and the Chongqing-Kyaukphyu corridor, aim to address this demand. Additionally, plans for the Kra land bridge by Thailand and the feasibility studies for land connectivity between India and Sri Lanka underscore efforts to establish Sri Lanka as a Regional Logistics Hub, facilitating trade with South India. President Wickremesinghe the historical significance of Perth in Sri Lanka-Australia relations, particularly during World War II when Royal Canadian Air Force Catalina Flying Boats established a crucial air link between Perth and Koggala Air Base in Ceylon, facilitating vital communication for the Allies. He emphasized the importance of the Indian Ocean, especially in light of historical events such as the Japanese attacks on Ceylon in 1942, which Winston Churchill described as a critical moment in the war. He discussed the multipolarity of the Indian Ocean region, shaped by events like the Bandung Conference in 1955, and the subsequent Non-Aligned Movement, which opposed big power rivalry. The speech outlined various diplomatic frameworks and groupings that have emerged in the Indian Ocean region, including IORA, Indo-Pacific, BRI, QUAD, and BRICS, along with the increased militarization by several countries, leading to a complex geopolitical landscape. Wickremesinghe also highlighted the growing strategic importance of the Western Indian Ocean, particularly in light of geopolitical shifts and the influence of major powers like Russia, China, and Iran. He addressed challenges such as attacks on commercial vessels by Houthi rebels, piracy, and threats to freedom of navigation, emphasizing the need for collective action to address these issues. Wickremesinghe went on to discuss the importance of connectivity initiatives for future economic growth, particularly in light of projected increases in GDP for countries like India and Indonesia by 2050. Furthermore, the Sri Lankan leader emphasized the urgency of addressing the climate crisis, noting the Indian Oceans vulnerability to warming and rising sea levels. He proposed initiatives such as the Tropical Belt Initiative and the International Climate Change University to mitigate the effects of climate change and ensure climate justice for vulnerable countries. In conclusion, Wickremesinghe called for unity among Indian Ocean Rim countries to address shared challenges and create a safer, more sustainable ocean environment. He advocated for the development of an overarching regional architecture for the Indian Ocean, emphasizing the responsibility of IORA leaders in achieving this goal. The event, themed Towards a Stable and Sustainable Indian Ocean, aims to foster cooperation among 40 participating nations. This conference was organized by the India Foundation in collaboration with Indias Ministry of External Affairs and the Australian Government, along with support from the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies, Singapore, and Perth-US Asia Centre. Singapores Minister of Foreign Affairs, Dr. Vivian Balakrishnan and Indias Minister of External Affairs, Dr. Subramanian Jaishankar also attended the event. The Indian Ocean Conference aims to foster cooperation among 40 participating nations. President Wickremesinghes participation reflects Sri Lankas proactive stance towards regional stability and development. Organized by the India Foundation in collaboration with Indias Ministry of External Affairs and the Australian Government, along with support from the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies, Singapore, and Perth-US Asia Centre, the conference seeks to chart a roadmap for the regions future.

        "date": "February 9, 2024 11:42 pm",
        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe says the Indian Ocean Regions stability requires an early end to the Gaza war followed by the establishment within 5 years of an Independent Palestine State and a guarantee for the security of the state of Israel. He made this remark while delivering the keynote address at the 7th Indian Ocean Conference in Perth, Australia on Friday (Feb.09). Wickremesinghe hit out at the United States for supporting the war in the densely populated Palestinian enclave. The ill-advised judgment of the US in supporting the Gaza war will diminish its influence in the Indian Ocean region. Commenting further, the President emphasized that the hostility of the countries forming the Islamic Arch in the Indian Ocean will prevent any close rapprochement with the US for some time. The Russian, Chinese and Iranian strategies are successfully biting at the US hegemony, and thereby further weakening the US, Wickremesinghe said underscoring the fact that Indian Ocean stability requires an early end to the Gaza war. With regard to the recent geopolitical developments and their impact on the Indian Ocean Region, the President said these have resulted in an increase in the strategic importance of the Western Indian Ocean that was not foreseen four years ago. This in turn is shifting the geopolitical emphasis towards the Indian Ocean, he added. Russia has now found new markets in China and the Western Indian Ocean due to the Ukrainian war, and the consequent Western sanctions on the resource-rich economy, the President continued. For example, Russian Crude Oil is refined in the Gulf refineries. Dubai has replaced London as the financial centre for the oligarchs. Russia has developed a closer friendship with Iran, which is an important source of supply for drones. Russia is carrying on naval exercises with Indian Ocean countries, including Myanmar and South Africa. China itself has played an active role in healing the rift between Iran and Saudi Arabia. Iran and its allies have become important players in West Asia. The Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, with India, Pakistan and Iran as members have the Western Indian Ocean as its outer limits. Read President Ranil Wickremesinghes full speech below: It is a great pleasure to be here in Perth for the 7th edition of the Indian Ocean Conference. I thank the Australian Government, for the hospitality afforded to all of us. I also thank the India Foundation for once again bringing us together. The theme of this Conference  Towards a Stable and Sustainable Indian Ocean- could not be timelier and more appropriate. The Australasian continent is unique in that it has borders with both the Indian Ocean and the Pacific Oceans. Perth played a crucial role in the history of Sri Lanka  Australia relations. During World War II, Royal Canadian Air Force, Catalina Flying Boats, traversed the expanse of the Indian Ocean, connecting Perth with Koggala Air Base in Ceylon. The only air link between the Indian subcontinent and Australia. Known as flights of the double sunrise, they operated a non-stop route upto 32 hours in radio silence, to ensure the success of a critical air route during World War II for the Allies. The Japanese attacks in April 1942 on the Indian Ocean specially Ceylon was described by Churchill as the most dangerous moment of the war highlighting the importance of the Indian Ocean to the British Empire. I was just talking with Dr. Balakrishnan and he said there were no carrier battles in the Indian Ocean for the simple reason that the Japanese sank the only British carrier. Let me highlight a few important developments which I hope will make a contribution to your deliberations. Firstly, historically speaking, the Indian Ocean is multipolar and has resisted domination by a single power. This multipolarity is a reflection of the essence of the Indian Ocean region and its people. As Asia emerged from colonialism the newly independent countries of Asia ie. Ceylon, India, Indonesia, Burma and Pakistan convened the Bandung Conference in 1955 to oppose colonialism in all its forms. The conference declaration to oppose big power rivalry in turn led to the Non Aligned Movement. Since then the Indian Ocean region has been influenced by the spirit of Bandung. It has never became a part of the US Hub and Spoke system. The past two decades has seen the emergence of diverse framings of the Indian Ocean region and a flurry of diplomatic activity articulating various policy positions, tilts, and frameworks. What is clear is that no single, objective geopolitical construct has emerged, and we are left instead with a contested vision with multiple interpretations. The key frameworks that have emerged include in addition to IORA, the Indo-Pacific, the BRI, the QUAD, and the BRICS. There are also regional organizations including ASEAN, ARF (ASEAN Regional Forum), ACD (Asia Cooperation Dialogue) BIMSTEC, SAARC, GCC, Arab League, OIC, SADC, EAC and SCO that have been established. Additionally, we have the operational arrangements that deal with specific areas of cooperation including RCEP, IONS, the Djibouti Code of Conduct, IOTC, Indian Ocean Commission (IOC), MASE, four regional Information Fusion Centres (Singapore, India, Seychelles and Madagascar), and the CGPCS (Contact Group on Piracy off the Coast of Somalia). Along with these frameworks and groupings, we also see an increased militarization of the Indian Ocean which is redefining power balances and alliances. In the maritime space we see a building up in naval capabilities in India, and with USA, Australia, UAE, Saudi Arabia, and China all increasing their naval presence significantly. Therefore, balancing between the great power rivalries is becoming an increasingly more complex task. As a result, the space for manoeuvrability for littoral states is shrinking fast as this rivalry in the Indian Ocean region intensifies and spills over into decision-making on political, economic and security issues. The proverbial question to choose one over the other is perennially hanging over us. Secondly, the geopolitical developments have resulted in an increase in the strategic importance of the Western Indian Ocean that was not foreseen four years ago. This in turn is shifting the geopolitical emphasis towards the Indian Ocean. The Ukrainian war, and the consequent Western sanctions on Russia has resulted in the resource-rich economy finding new markets in China and the Western Indian Ocean. For example, Russian Crude Oil is refined in the Gulf refineries. Dubai has replaced London as the financial centre for the oligarchs. Russia has developed a closer friendship with Iran, which is an important source of supply for drones. Russia is carrying on naval exercises with Indian Ocean countries, including Myanmar and South Africa. China itself has played an active role in healing the rift between Iran and Saudi Arabia. Iran and its allies have become important players in West Asia. The Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, with India, Pakistan and Iran as members have the Western Indian Ocean as its outer limits. The ill-advised judgment of the US in supporting the Gaza war will diminish its influence in the region. The hostility of the countries forming the Islamic Arch in the Indian Ocean will prevent any close rapprochement with the US for some time. The Russian, Chinese and Iranian strategies are successfully biting at the US hegemony thereby further weakening the US. The Indian Ocean stability requires an early end to the Gaza war followed by, a. the establishment within 5 years of an Independent Palestine State and b. guarantees for the security of the state of Israel. Thirdly, the recent attacks on commercial vessels by the Yemen-based Houthi rebels, is a challenge to the Freedom of Navigation. We have to ensure access and mobility in the Suez Canal, Red Sea, Bab-el-Mandeb and the Gulf of Aden. In addition, we also face the threat of Somali Pirates, once again. The safety of undersea cables and critical infrastructure are also facing additional threats. The presence of drugs in the Indian Ocean and Human Smuggling has increased. IUU fishing still takes place. These threats present challenges to the Freedom of Navigation. We need to refocus on the freedom of navigation in the Indian Ocean. Sri Lanka offers to recommence the discussions on the Freedom of Nation in the Indian Ocean. Fourth, is expanding connectivity. According to estimates there will be an eight-fold increase in the GDP of India and Indonesia by 2050. Similar increases are expected in some of the other countries in South and West Asia. This requires additional port capacities and new transport routes. The Suez Canal may not be sufficient. In this regard Indias two new connectivity initiatives are welcome. Firstly, the India (Mumbai)  Iran  Russia corridor and secondly the India (Mumbai)  Middle East  Europe corridor. Similarly, there are connectivity initiatives taking place in the Bay of Bengal. Work has already commenced on the Chongqing  Kyaukphyu corridor giving access to Western China. Thailand is planning the Kra land bridge connecting the Gulf of Siam with the Bay of Bengal. India and Sri Lanka are commencing feasibility studies on land connectivity between the two countries making Sri Lanka a Regional Logistics Hub with Colombo and Trincomalee ports available to South India. The Indian Ocean Conference theme this year Towards a more stable and sustainable Indian Ocean highlights the two key areas which require our focus. What I have outlined before, dealt primarily with pursuing stability of the region. There is an equally serious, more immediate and existential threat that looms and that is the Climate Crisis. Experts have revealed that the Indian Ocean is warming at a higher rate than the other oceans around the world. The levels of warming are estimated to be three times higher than in the Pacific Ocean and coastal areas across the IOR will experience continuous rise in sea levels and face severe coastal erosion. The Indian Ocean is also rising at a level of 3.7 millimetres annually and extreme sea disasters are inevitable. The island states of the IOR are vulnerable and have to be provided with adequate resources to mitigate the effects of climate change. Changes at sea also affect monsoon patterns and in turn impact on agriculture and food security across the Indian Ocean region. They also impact on the biodiversity and in turn on food and livelihood of people of the littoral states. The Indian Ocean presents opportunities in terms of ecology. Not only is it our biggest sink for Carbon, but it also provides potential for mitigating the climate crisis, through offshore wind, solar, and wave energy. Through seaweed farming and mangrove cultivation, we can increase the sequestration of Carbon. Sustainable exploitation of our Oceans resources is critical for our survival, as the Ocean provides for our future. At COP 28 Sri Lanka proposed three key initiatives, (1) the Tropical Belt Initiative, including the Indian Ocean (2) The International Climate Change University and the Climate Justice Forum. As the current Chair of the Indian Ocean Rim Association (IORA) Sri Lanka is focusing on the interdependence between the Indian Ocean and climate change. The Climate Justice Forum aims to accelerate financing of losses and damages and includes debt justice as an essential component of the overall solution. Any proposals for mitigation and adaptation interventions must take into account the debt component faced by Climate-vulnerable and developing countries. We are living in uncertain times. The stability we had taken for granted since the end of WWII and the Cold War is unravelling. Globalisation is being challenged as is multilateralism. The Climate Crisis is affecting prospects for trade and economic development around the world. It is impacting on food security, livelihoods, supply chains, biodiversity and maritime transportation. Either we can wait for global developments to dictate our fate or unite, so that we may chart our own course. Creating a safer ocean environment by building confidence and predictability among users and enhancing ocean situational awareness will be key to maintaining peace and security in the Indian Ocean. The main platform that can undertake this important task is the Indian Ocean Rim Association (IORA). Ensuring a peaceful and secure Indian Ocean would facilitate sustainable use of oceans for the economic and social benefit of coastal and littoral states. An overarching architecture for the Indian Ocean that deals with critical issues is required. The basis for such a structure is already in existence including the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (1982) and the recently adopted BBNJ agreement in 2023 on the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity of areas beyond national jurisdiction or the High Seas Treaty. A Code of Conduct on freedom of navigation and over flight and unimpeded commerce and similar guiding principles on dealing with the climate crisis and the sustainable use of the Indian Ocean are a necessity. Only the leaders of the IORA countries can ensure that these measures are translated to the creation of an overarching regional architecture for the Indian Ocean region. Therefore the responsibility lies with us. I thank you.",
