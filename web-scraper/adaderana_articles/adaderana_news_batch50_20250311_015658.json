        "date": "September 5, 2023 01:08 pm",
        "content": "Minister of Labour and Foreign Employment Manusha Nanayakkara has revealed that a new inquiry will be conducted into the recent allegations made by UKs Channel 4 pertaining to the 2019 Easter Sunday terror attacks. Addressing Parliament this morning (05 Sep.), Nanayakkara stated that a special Parliamentary Committee will be appointed for this purpose, adding that while the need for international assistance to investigate these accusations has been recognised, such measures too, will be taken if required. He stated that the matters of concern were discussed at the Cabinet meeting held on Monday (04 Sep.), assuring that current government will not hesitate to investigate these claims. Despite his assurances, however, the Minister opined a rather skeptical view pertaining to the expos√© due to be aired by the British television channel at 11:05 p.m. today, claiming that the channel had a common practice of airing such controversial videos close to the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) sessions in Geneva. Channel 4 became well-known in Sri Lanka in the past after airing several controversial videos alleging that war crimes had taken place in Sri Lanka, including its 2011 documentary Sri Lankas Killing Fields, a hard-hitting investigation into the final weeks of the Sri Lankan war. In its new documentary, titled Sri Lankas Easter Bombings  Dispatches, Channel 4 claims to uncover shocking new revelations about Sri Lankas deadly Easter bombings of 2019, as high-placed whistle blowers allege complicity by officials inside the government.",

        "date": "September 5, 2023 01:42 pm",
        "content": "Steve Harwell, the longtime frontman of the Grammy-nominated pop rock band Smash Mouth that was behind the megahit All Star has died. He was 56. The bands manager, Robert Hayes, said Harwell passed peacefully and comfortably Monday morning surrounded by family and friends at his home in Boise, Idaho. The cause of death was acute liver failure, Hayes said in a statement. Smash Mouth is also known for hits including  Walkin on the Sun  and  Then The Morning Comes. Steve Harwell was a true American Original. A larger than life character who shot up into the sky like a Roman candle, Hayes said. Steve should be remembered for his unwavering focus and impassioned determination to reach the heights of pop stardom. His only tools were his irrepressible charm and charisma, his fearlessly reckless ambition, Hayes said, adding: Steve lived a 100 full-throttle life. Burning brightly across the universe before burning out. He will be greatly missed by those who knew and loved him, he said. Born in California in 1967, Harwell performed in a rap group called F.O.S. (Freedom of Speech) before forming Smash Mouth in 1994. The band released two platinum albums on Interscope Records, their ska-fueled 1997 debut and 1999s Astro Lounge. The second album featured some of the bands biggest hits, including the Grammy-nominated, platinum single All Star, which appeared in the movie Shrek alongside their cover of the Monkees Im a Believer. Humor was a driving force behind Smash Mouths success, and at the forefront was Harwells playful alt-rock voice and persona. He made a cameo in 2001 comedy film Rat Race, and had a well-documented friendship with the Food Network chef and host Guy Fieri. On Monday, tributes began pouring in. Fieri wrote on Instagram: To my brutha Steve RIP. Today is a sad day, I will miss my friend. NSYNC s Chris Kirkpatrick and Joey Fatone also shared short homages. Im truly sorry for the difficult battle you had to fight, Kirkpatrick posted on Instagram. You were an amazing soul and will be deeply missed. Fatone said he had known Harwell for a long time. Opened for NSync and even was my wedding singer at my wedding, wrote Fatone. Hopefully people out there that are dealing with addiction. get the right help that they need. Today host Carson Daly published a two-part statement on Instagram, detailing the first time he met Harwell in 1995, when he was a DJ on JOME in San Jose and Smash Mouth was a new band. In better days, Steve was a force of a frontman  lived the life of 50 men, Daly wrote. He brought joy to millions with his music and his legacy will thankfully live on. Rest in peace Steve Harwell, comedian Tom Green tweeted. I remember hanging with you back in the MTV days you were always super cool and an amazing talent - my condolences to your family and friends. Harwell retired from performing and left Smash Mouth in 2021. The band continued to tour with Zach Goode as the singer. Smash Mouth released a statement at the time saying Harwell had been diagnosed with cardiomyopathy eight years earlier and had suffered nonstop serious medical setbacks including heart failure as well as acute Wernicke Encephalopathy.

        "date": "September 5, 2023 05:10 pm",
        "content": "Despite facing frequent and intrusive scrutiny, along with a slew of extensive tests, for his bowling action, cricketer Muttiah Muralitharan rarely engaged in verbal responses. The off-spinner consistently adhered to the show, dont tell strategy, silencing his critics by showcasing his exceptional skills on the field. Currently a member of the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame, Muralitharan is widely recognised as one of the greatest bowlers in cricket history, having achieved the remarkable feat of taking 800 Test wickets and over 530 wickets in ODIs. Now, the world eagerly anticipates the upcoming biopic titled 800, which will shed light on Muralitharans life and journey. Legendary Indian cricketer Sachin Tendulkar unveiled the films official trailer in Mumbai, accompanied by Muralitharan and former Sri Lankan cricketer and captain Sanath Jayasuriya. The 186-second 800 trailer opens by emphasising that the film delves into The unknown story of Muttiah Muralitharan. It begins by offering glimpses of the events in Sri Lanka during the 1970s when pogroms targeted the minority Tamils, highlighting the challenges the population faced during that period. For someone who hails from a group of migrant labourers, getting recognised as a citizen itself is very tough, a voiceover says as we get to see a young man wearing a white cricket jersey kneeling before an armed army personnel who holds him at gunpoint. As the trailer unfolds, it reveals the transformation of this young man into a revered figure. The promo video showcases his rise to fame, his sharing of the spotlight with cricket legends like Arjuna Ranatunga, and his significant contributions to the legacy of the Sri Lankan cricket team. The trailer also sheds light on the no-ball taunts that were frequently directed at him and how he was unfairly targeted for chucking. The emotionally charged trailer concludes with Murali making a triumphant comeback and capturing the hearts of the viewers. Written and directed by MS Sripathy, the film will be released in Tamil, Hindi and Telugu. Starring Madhur Mittal, who won widespread acclaim with his performance as Salim in Danny Boyles Slumdog Millionaire, in the lead role, 800s official release date is yet to be announced. Bankrolled jointly by Movie Train Motion Picture and Vivek Rangachari, 800s music has been composed by Ghibran while RD Rajasekar ISC has handled its cinematography and Praveen KL the editing.

        "date": "September 5, 2023 06:23 pm",
        "content": "A row has broken out in India after Prime Minister Narendra Modis government used the term Bharat in an official invite for the G20 Summit being sent on behalf of the president. Bharat is the Hindi name for India. The dinner invitation from President Droupadi Murmu to foreign leaders attending the summit describes her as President of Bharat. Several ministers from the ruling BJP party cheered the move, but opposition leaders questioned its purpose. The move comes amid reports that the government is mulling changing the name of the country officially to Bharat - but there has been no confirmation. All of Indias official websites still use the term government of India and Ms Murmu is still referred to as the President of India on X (formerly Twitter). However, Bharats use in the invite comes just two days after Mohan Bhagwat, the chief of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) - the ideological mentor of the BJP - said that the country should be called Bharat instead of India. At times we use India so those who speak English will understand. But we must stop using this. The name of the country Bharat will remain Bharat wherever you go in the world, Mr Bhagwat said. On Tuesday, several BJP politicians welcomed the move, calling it a proud moment for the country. Happy and proud that our civilisation is marching ahead boldly towards Amrit Kaal, Himanta Biswa Sarma, chief minister of Assam state, tweeted. Amrit Kaal that loosely translates as the golden era is a term the prime minister and other government officials are using to refer to the years leading up to 2047 when India will turn 100. They say by then India will be among the most prosperous and developed nations in the world. The comments drew a sharp response from opposition leaders who linked it to their newly-formed coalition which is called INDIA, an acronym for Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance. It has just been a few weeks since we named our alliance as INDIA and BJP has started sending invitations with Republic of Bharat instead of Republic of India, tweeted Manoj Jha, a leader of the Rashtriya Janata Dal party of Bihar state. You will neither be able to take India from us, nor Bharat, he added. This is not the first instance of the government using Bharat in connection with the G20. It has also used the term in a handbook - called Bharat, The Mother Of Democracy - for foreign delegates, reports BBCs legal correspondent Umang Poddar. The Indian constitution also refers to India as Bharat, though only once - Article 1 says that India, that is Bharat, shall be a Union of States. However, everywhere else in the constitution, the country is referred to as India. In the past, cases have been filed in the Supreme Court, seeking to change Indias name to Bharat. But the judges have refused to get drawn into the controversy, and in one instance asked the petitioner to approach the government. A few judges have made oral observations on the debate but these have no legal value. India is already called Bharat in the constitution, former Chief Justice of India Sharad Bobde once remarked. Another former chief justice TS Thakur had said that it was up to the citizens to choose whether they wanted to call it India or Bharat. India is hosting this years G20 summit, which will be held in the capital, Delhi, from 9-10 September. The G20 includes the worlds 19 wealthiest countries plus the European Union. India currently holds the G20 presidency, which rotates annually between members. Source - BBC - Agencies",

The officials stated this when the Committee on Public Finance (COPF) asked how long such restrictions would be in place after advertently considering the duopolies such restrictions have caused, especially in wheat flour and tile industries, the Parliamentary Communications Department said. The COPF discussion, chaired by Dr. Harsha de Silva, was held at the parliamentary complex today (Sep. 05). Accordingly, the Committee took into consideration the Regulation under the Imports and Exports (Controls) Act, No. 1 of 1969 published in the Gazette Extraordinary 234138 of July 20, 2023, and was approved by the Committee. Meanwhile, the Order under the Foreign Exchange Act, No. 12 of 2017 was also considered and approved during the COPF meeting chaired by Dr. Harsha de Silva, the statement mentioned. Thus, the eligible migration allowance for the emigrants who are claiming the migration allowance for the first time was increased from USD 30,000 up to a maximum of USD 50,000 or equivalent in any other designated foreign currency. The Committee questioned the position of equity for those who migrated the year before the order was put in place. The officials present stated that emigrants who have already claimed migration allowance could claim the remainder up to a maximum of USD 20,000. Moreover, the Social Security Contribution Levy (Amendment) Bill was also considered by the Committee on Public Finance and was approved. Accordingly, the said Bill intends to amend the said Act to exempt any motor vehicle liable to the excise duty under the Excise (Special Provisions) Act, No. 13 of 1989 on the importation in considering excise duty is a composite tax introduced to simplify the tax structure, previously included in the Act, Parliamentary Communications Department stated.

        "title": "Proposal for national policy on agriculture submitted to address fertilizer crisis",
        "date": "September 5, 2023 09:30 pm",
        "content": "Chairman of the Sectoral Oversight Committee on Food Security and Agriculture, MP D. Weerasinghe said that they have already proposed a national policy for agriculture to regulate the usage, quality and price of chemical fertilizers and seeds imported to the country based on experimental data carried out for several decades. He also mentioned that it has been confirmed that the highest rice yield per hectare can be obtained by using 70 chemical fertilizers and 30 organic fertilizers in proportion, based on research conducted since 2003 and the proposed national policy will also include those findings. MP Weerasinghe conveyed these updates during a media briefing held today (05 Sep.) at the Presidential Media Centre (PMC) under the theme Collective Path to a Stable Country. MP D. Weerasinghe further said; Even though governments have changed, every sector needs to have a national policy that does not change. The agriculture sector has been waiting for a national policy for the last 25 years. If we lose the quality of the agricultural sector, the countrys agriculture will fail. Therefore, this country needs a national policy regarding imported chemical fertilizers and seeds together with their price regulation. In the next sectoral oversight committee meeting, a report will be submitted to investigate the quality of chemical fertilizers and seeds and to regulate their prices. Under the direct advice of President Ranil Wickremesinghe, we are in the process of introducing modern technology to traditional agriculture. Also, measures are being taken to provide training to agriculture-related government officials regarding the use of fertilizers. Due to the overuse of chemical fertilizers for many decades, the quality of the soil has now decreased. It has been recommended to apply 70 chemical fertilizers and 30 organic fertilizers for crops in proportion. However, there is a problem regarding the quality of these applied fertilizers. Some companies produce high-quality fertilizers in the country. However, due to the recent issues related to fertilizers, their image has suffered some damage. It should be rectified again. Programs should be prepared to protect such entrepreneurs and promote agriculture around the country. Entrepreneurs who produce organic bio-fertilizers and liquid fertilizers should be gathered and this program should be carried forward. This cannot be done overnight. It is necessary to provide organic fertilizers to the farmers for at least five seasons to make this program successful. Through the Colombo Declaration signed under the United Nations Global Environment Programme in 2016, we have agreed that the nitrogen waste released into the environment should be reduced by 50 by 2030. Therefore, the implementation of this program is mandatory. Also, the European Union has decided to make their purchases of completely organic fruits and vegetables when exporting to their countries by 2030. So if we hope to export fruits and vegetables to EU countries in the future, we should tend to use organic fertilizers. That is why it was decided as a committee to continue the agricultural production process with organic fertilizers. In 2013, the Ministry of Agriculture recommended the use of organic fertilizers. They have asked to apply 10 metric tons per hectare. However, the farmers are facing practical problems. Ten thousand kilos cannot be applied per hectare of land. But today, government and private institutions have researched together and produced bio and liquid fertilizers. It is possible to increase the yield by 40 through the use of nano-fertilizers, compared to 100 chemical fertilizers. Also, 70 organic fertilizers and 30 chemical fertilizers can increase the yield of this country from 13 to 25. There is a very wrong attitude among farmers regarding organic fertilizers. Therefore, there should be a change in the attitude of the farmers as well. Chemical fertilizer companies are ahead of us and they have drawn it. Therefore, the time has come to create a new attitude change among the farmers. The agriculture modernization program is essential for this country. Organic fertilizers should be used for the safety of seeds, health and soil. If not, the degradation of our soil is inevitable. Peoples health, seeds and the whole agriculture sector would be destroyed. Before the use of chemical fertilizers in 1960, this country was self-sufficient in agriculture. Everyone has to think again about what happened to this Eastern Granary. Also, the government spends a lot of money to import chemical fertilizers. Many people are still protesting against this program. As a young MP who came to the Parliament by the vote of the farmers, I will fulfil my responsibility to the country even if I lose my political career.",

Dont turn our ship into a battleground for rivalries that destroy one another, Jakarta Globe News quoted Jokowi. This ocean is too vast for us to sail alone. We will meet other ships, namely ASEANs dialogue partners. Let us work in concert to achieve a fair and mutually beneficial cooperation as we sail towards an epicentrum of growth, he said. However, he added: Differences of opinion among the blocs members are common. ... ASEAN remains united to this day. Unity is harmony in diversity, said Jokowi, adding that the ASEAN plays a crucial role in maintaining peace in the wider Asia-Pacific region. Leaders and representatives from ASEANs partner countries including China, India, South Korea, Japan, New Zealand, Australia, the Russian Federation, Canada and the US are also attending the summit. Indonesia, the current chair of the 10-member regional bloc, is hosting the summit to discuss the development and strengthening of cooperation between the bloc and its partners. Regional peace and political violence in junta-ruled Myanmar remain high on the agenda. On Monday, the Philippines said it will advocate for a rules-based international order in the disputed South China Sea. Several ASEAN members have maritime disputes with China in the minerals-rich South China Sea. Chinese Premier Li Qiang is also participating in the summit. - Agencies",

It recruited thousands of convicts from Russian prisons to fight in Ukraine, providing the main assault force for Russias 2022-2023 winter offensive there. In June this year the group launched a brief mutiny in Russia, condemned as treason by President Vladimir Putin, and on Aug. 23 its boss Yevgeny Prigozhin and top lieutenants were killed in a plane crash. Britain sanctioned Prigozhin in 2020, the Wagner Group as a whole in March 2022, and in July this year sanctioned individuals and businesses with links to the group in the Central African Republic, Mali and Sudan.

According to the documentary, Maulana, who has sought asylum in Switzerland after facing fraud charges here, has presented his testimony to the UN Human Rights Council and has also been interviewed by European intelligence agencies. Maulana told Channel 4 that he witnessed a meeting between the suicide bombers and a top Sri Lankan intelligence officer prior to the Easter Sunday attacks. Claiming that he had, on the directives of Pillayan, arranged the said meeting between then-army intelligence chief Major General Suresh Sallay and the National Thowheed Jamaath (NTJ) members including its leader Zahran Hashim, Maulana said the plot to create insecurity in the country to pave way for former president Gotabaya Rajapaksa to win the presidential election later in 2019 was hatched over 2-3 years. According to Maulana, the meeting was held in Puttalam in January 2018. Channel 4 says Sallay has denied the accusations, telling the Dispatches that he was in Malaysia at the time the supposed meeting took place. He has further said that he was attending training in India when the Easter Sunday attacks happened. The documentary, which recaps the countrys political situation, also provides a lengthy commentary on former presidents Mahinda Rajapaksa and Gotabaya Rajapaksas time in power and their attempts to return to power after election defeats. Recalling the 2009 disappearance of journalist Lasantha Wickrematunga who was a prominent critic of the then-government, the Dispatches investigation video claims that Mahinda Rajapaksas administration had formed a clandestine death squad called the Tripoli Platoon with the support of Pillayans group to crack down on anti-government media persons. It interviews former senior CID officer Nishantha Silva who was investigating the disappearance of Wickrematunga. He claims that he found phone record evidence putting Tripoli Platoon members at the scene and that Gotabaya Rajapaksa had direct monitoring of this death squad. The documentary also presents testimonies from His Eminence Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith, journalist Frederica Jansz who was a witness in the White Flag case, the brother of journalist Lasantha Wickrematunga, former commissioner of Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka (HRCSL) Ambika Satkunanathan and former diplomat Sarath Kongahage.",

        "title": "US top diplomat Blinken makes surprise visit to Kyiv in show of support",
        "date": "September 6, 2023 03:45 pm",
        "content": "U.S. Secretary of State Anthony Blinken arrived in Kyiv on an unannounced visit Wednesday, hours after Russia launched its first missile attack in a week against the Ukrainian capital. Blinkens trip aimed to assess Ukraines 3-month-old counteroffensive and signal continued U.S. support for Kyivs efforts to drive out the Kremlins forces as some Western allies are expressing worries about progress after 19 months of war, according to U.S. officials. After arriving in Kyiv, Blinken laid a wreath at the citys Berkovetske cemetery to commemorate members of the Ukrainian armed forces who lost their lives defending the country. He is expected to meet with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal, and Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba to discuss the ongoing counteroffensive and reconstruction efforts. On the train journey to Kyiv, Blinken met with Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen, also on an official visit, to discuss the war. Blinken thanked her for Denmarks leadership in a coalition training Ukrainian pilots on F-16s and for promising to donate the fighter jets to Ukraine, according to State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller. Washington officials said there will be discussions of alternative export routes for Ukrainian grain following Russias exit from the Black Sea Grain Initiative and its frequent bombardment of port facilities in the Odesa region, from which most grain is transported abroad. Those alternatives may include new overland routes, or ships hugging coastlines to keep out of international waters where they could be targeted by Russias navy. Blinkens visit is expected to include the announcement of new military aid of between 175 million to 200 million. Another, larger military assistance package is expected later this week. Other issues, including support for Ukraines war-torn economy will be discussed, building on Blinkens June announcement in London of 1.3 billion in aid to help Kyiv rebuild, with a focus on modernizing its energy network, which was bombarded by Russia last winter. Overnight, Russia fired cruise missiles at Kyiv in the first aerial attack on the capital since Aug. 30, according to Serhii Popko, the head of Kyivs regional military administration. Debris from a downed missile struck the premises of a business in Kyiv, causing a fire and damage to the companys equipment. No casualties were reported. In the Odesa region, meanwhile, one person was killed in a Russian missile and drone attack that hit Izmail port. The attack damaged grain elevators, administrative buildings and agricultural enterprises, local authorities said. The trip to Blinkens fourth visit to Ukraine since the war began, including one very brief excursion over the Polish-Ukrainian border in March 2022, just a month after the Russian invasion. However, it will be the first time Americas top diplomat spends the night in Ukraines capital since he visited Kyiv in January 2022, before the invasion. U.S. officials said Blinkens decision to stay overnight in Kyiv is intended to send a symbolic signal of American support for Ukraine as the 18-month-old war drags on. Shared priorities will be discussed with the state of Ukraines counter-offensive high on the agenda, a senior U.S. State Department official briefed reporters ahead of the trip, speaking on condition of anonymity in line with protocols. The official highlighted the importance of being well-aligned on how Ukrainians see developments on the ground many weeks into the fight, which Kyivs troops launched in June. Blinkens visit comes after some of Ukraines allies have privately expressed concern that Ukrainian troops may fail to reach their objectives. While the U.S. has been concerned by certain day-to-day battlefield setbacks, U.S. officials said, they are still generally encouraged by Ukraines handling of the military situation, particularly its air defense capabilities in knocking down Russian drones aimed at Kyiv. Blinken aims to get a view on how the counter-offensive is progressing and what kind of support is required in the current phase of the battle, including materials to break through dense Russian defense lines while the winter season looms. Air defense will also continue to be a priority, the official said. Source - The Associated Press --Agencies",

        "content": "Former Sri Lankan cricketer Sachithra Senanayake has been remanded until 15 September on orders of the Colombo Magistrates Court, in the case filed over allegations of match-fixing. The relevant order was issued by Colombo Chief Magistrate Prasanna Alwis, when Senanayake was presented before the court this afternoon (06 Sep.). Earlier today, Senanayake was arrested after he reportedly surrendered to the Special Investigations Unit of the Sports Ministry this morning. An overseas travel ban was imposed on the former national player, on orders of the Colombo Magistrates Court, on 14 August, a day after the Attorney Generals Department instructed the Ministry of Sports and Youth Affairs to file criminal charges against Senanayake for alleged match-fixing, as sufficient evidence has been gathered to support the charges. The 38-year-old had allegedly approached two cricketers participating in the first edition of the Lanka Premier League (LPL) in 2020 via phone calls from Dubai, instigating them to fix matches during the tournament. The Lanka Premier League was held from November 27 to December 17, 2020 in Hambantota, Sri Lanka. In 2020, a media report had alleged that the 38-year-old had contacted two cricketers participating in the first edition of the Lanka Premier League (LPL) in 2020 instigating them into corrupt practices in the inaugural LPL tournament, through phone calls made from Dubai. The former Sri Lanka off-spinner however had refuted the allegations while claiming that they were attempts to defame and slander him. He vehemently denied any connection to him over the allegations.",

        "date": "September 6, 2023 05:07 pm",
        "content": "The European Union on Wednesday targeted Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, Google parent Alphabet, Facebook owner Meta and TikTok parent ByteDance under new digital rules aimed at reining in the market power of online companies. The six companies were classed as online gatekeepers that must face the highest level of scrutiny under the 27-nation blocs Digital Markets Act. The act amounts to a list of dos and donts that seeks to prevent tech giants from cornering new digital markets, with the threat of whopping fines or even the possibility of a company breakup. Its part of a sweeping update to the EUs digital rulebook thats starting to take force this year, and comes weeks after a companion package of rules aimed at keeping internet users safe, the Digital Services Act, started kicking in. Its time to turn the tables and ensure that no online platform behaves as if it was too big to care, European Commissioner Thierry Breton, whos in charge of the blocs digital policy, said ahead of the announcement. The EUs executive Commission said digital platforms can be listed as gatekeepers if they act as key gateways between businesses and consumers by providing core platform services. Those services include Googles Chrome browser, Microsofts Windows operating systems, chat apps like Metas WhatsApp, social networks like TikTok, and others playing a middleman role like Amazons Marketplace and Apples App Store. The companies now have six months to start complying with the Digital Markets Acts requirements, which are set to shake up how Big Tech companies operate. Messaging services will be required to work with each other. That means Telegram or Signal users could exchange texts or video files with WhatsApp users. Platforms are banned from ranking their own products or services higher than their rivals in search results. So, Amazon isnt allowed to make its own-brand products easier to find than those from third-party merchants. Online services cant combine a users personal data to build up a profile for targeted advertising, unless consent is explicitly given. Violations could result in fines of up to 10 of a companys annual global revenue, and up to 20 for repeat offenders, or even a breakup of the company. Source - The Associated Press --Agencies",

The 34-year-old Jonas Brothers singer filed to end his marriage with the 27-year-old star of Game of Thrones and X-Men actor in Floridas Miami-Dade County Court. The filing says the marriage between the parties is irretrievably broken. Turner and Jonas married in a secretive ceremony at a Las Vegas wedding chapel on May 1, 2019, after the Billboard Music Awards. Country duo Dan  Shay performed at the wedding. The couple had a daughter, Willa, in 2020, and last year had another daughter whose name they have not made public. Jonas is seeking joint custody of the girls, according to the divorce documents. The two had a prenuptial-agreement that Jonas expects will be enforced, according to the filing. Representatives for Jonas and Turner did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The couple said in interviews that mutual friends had long wanted to introduce them when they began talking via Instagram direct messages in 2016. They met in person in October of that year and were dating each other exclusively by December. They announced their engagement in October 2017. Turner, who is from Northampton, England, played Sansa Stark for eight seasons on HBOs Game of Thrones and played Jean Grey in 2016s X-Men: Apocalypse and 2019s Dark Phoenix.

        "date": "September 6, 2023 05:55 pm",
        "content": "Sri Lanka suffers from a continuing accountability deficit - be it for war crime atrocities, more recent human rights violations, corruption, or abuse of power - which must be addressed for the country to move forward, according to a UN Human Rights Office report published on Wednesday. Lack of accountability at all levels remains the fundamental main human rights problem. Whether it refers to war crime atrocities, post-war emblematic cases, torture and deaths in police custody, excesses in crowd control, corruption and the abuse of power, Sri Lanka suffers from an extraordinary accountability deficit that unless addressed will drag the country further behind, the report said. The High Commissioner urged the Government and Sri Lankan political parties to strive for and deliver on long over-due democratic renewal, deeper institutional reforms and tangible progress on accountability, reconciliation and human rights. More than a year ago mass protests demanded better governance and an inclusive vision for Sri Lanka - in short, a renewal of the social contract. But the potential for a historic transformation that would address long-standing challenges is far from being realised, said UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker T√ºrk. Fourteen years since the end of the war, tens of thousands of victims and their families continue to experience the pain and agony of seeking truth, justice, and remedy. While the Government has proposed a new truth-seeking mechanism, the report stresses that the groundwork needs to be laid by genuine efforts to create the enabling environment for any transitional justice process to succeed. This starts through meaningful and transparent consultations with victims and civil society on the current truth-seeking proposal and includes an end to all forms of harassment and unlawful and arbitrary surveillance against human rights defenders and victims groups, as well as support for initiatives to acknowledge and memorialize the experience of victims. Truth-seeking alone will not suffice. It must also be accompanied by a clear commitment to accountability and the political will to implement far-reaching change, T√ºrk said. Among other recommendations, the report calls on the authorities to accelerate investigations and prosecutions into emblematic cases of human rights violations, as well as the 2019 Easter Sunday bombings. The High Commissioner has previously urged an independent investigation with international assistance to pursue further lines of inquiry into the full circumstances of the 2019 Easter Sunday attacks. The report provides an update on the work of the accountability project established by the UN Human Rights Office pursuant to resolutions 461 and 511. The High Commissioner repeated his call for the international community to support accountability initiatives, notably through investigations and prosecutions using universal or extra-territorial jurisdiction, with other complementary measures. The report also details a number of concerns with proposed new laws, including a new Anti-Terrorism Bill and legislation to regulate broadcasting. The report notes that the President has set a different tone in advancing reconciliation initiatives and has promised to stop land acquisition for archaeological, or security purposes, which has been an increasing source of local conflicts and tension. At the same time, the UN Human Rights Office continued to receive reports of disputes over land, particularly in the North and East of the country. The continuing impact of the economic crisis of 2022 and the global downturn on peoples human rights and well-being is highlighted in the report, including a dramatic increase in Sri Lankas poverty rate which doubled from 13 in 2021 to 25 in 2022. Food insecurity is affecting a significant proportion of the population, in turn impacting the right to health and increasing the risk of school dropouts. The High Commissioner said the international community, including international financial institutions, should support Sri Lanka in its economic recovery and in meeting its international obligations, while pressing for genuine progress in governance, transparency, and accountability. I urge the Government and Sri Lankan political parties to strive for and deliver on the urgent need for renewal, deeper institutional reforms and tangible progress on accountability, reconciliation and human rights, T√ºrk said. This would be particularly appropriate in this year that marks both the 75th anniversary of Sri Lankas independence and the 75th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

        "date": "September 6, 2023 06:14 pm",
        "content": "His Eminence Malcolm Cardinal Ranjith has urged President Ranil Wickremesinghe and the government to launch a free, impartial, just, transparent and broad investigation into the alleged plot behind the 2019 Easter Sunday bombings in Sri Lanka, unveiled in British television network Channel 4s controversial documentary. In a press release today (Sept. 06), the Archbishop of Colombo said this probe should be conducted through an independent international investigation team, assisted by all Criminal Investigation Department (CID) officials who were removed from investigations into the terror attacks, and transferred on political influence. Cardinal Ranjith emphasized that the investigation should be carried out on the findings outlined in various commission reports already presented and recommendations that are yet to be implemented. Calling for a probe into the individuals who were accused in Channel 4 expos√© of being complicit in the supposed plot hatched to create insecurity in the country, Cardinal Ranjith said their role in this mass murder should be examined extensively. Since these fresh investigations need to be independent, Cardinal Ranjith said all those officials in the police and intelligence services coming under investigation and those in top posts at present should be suspended forthwith to ensure the independence and transparency of the inquiry. Similarly, DIG Nilantha Jayawardena who was found guilty and fined by the Supreme Court for culpable neglect of duties during the time of Easter Sunday terror attacks and DIG Deshabandu Tennakoon whose neglect of duty during this atrocity had been cited by the Presidential Commission of Inquiry (PCoI) for disciplinary action should both be suspended from service until the new inquiry is over, Cardinal Ranjiths statement read further. Referring to Minister Manusha Nanayakkaras announcement on plans to appoint a Parliamentary Select Committee (PSC) to look into the allegations in the Channel 4 film, the Archbishop of Colombo slammed it as a waste of public funds and time, and an exercise of simply misleading the public. Recalling that despite the appointment of a PCoI and a PSC to probe the bombings soon after its occurrence, the political authorities have not taken any credible, positive action on the recommendations made by these panels. For this reason, we do not endorse such a strategy and reject that plan outright. Unless a transparent, sincere investigation is launched, Cardinal Ranjith said truth and justice would be meted out to the victims of the Easter Sunday bombings. We do not believe in mere promises, but we need action, and action that is absolutely independent, transparent and internationally monitored. The Archbishop of Colombo expressed his gratitude to the Channel 4 television network for the interest and trouble it took to focus attention worldwide on this alleged plot behind the bombings.

        "title": "China bans government officials from using iPhones for work, Wall Street Journal reports",
        "date": "September 6, 2023 09:13 pm",
        "content": "China ordered officials at central government agencies not to use Apples iPhones and other foreign-branded devices for work or bring them into the office, the Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday, citing people familiar with the matter. In recent weeks, staff were given the instructions by their superiors in workplace chat groups or meetings, according to the report, which added that it wasnt clear how widely the orders were being distributed. The ban comes ahead of an Apple event next week that analysts believe will be about launching a new line of iPhones, and could trigger concerns among foreign companies operating in China as Sino-U.S. tensions escalate. The WSJ report did not name other phone makers besides Apple. Apple and Chinas State Council Information Office, which handles media queries on behalf of the Chinese government, did not immediately respond to Reuters requests for comment. The iPhone makers shares were down 1.5 in early trading. For over a decade, China has been seeking to reduce reliance on foreign technologies, asking state-affiliated firms such as banks to switch to local software and promoting domestic semiconductor chip manufacturing. Beijing ratcheted up this campaign in 2020, when its leaders proposed a so-called dual circulation growth model to reduce reliance on overseas markets and technology, as its concerns over data security grew. In May, China urged big state-owned enterprises to play a key role in its drive to attain self-reliance in technology, raising the stakes in the race amid rifts with the United States. Sino-U.S. tensions have been high as Washington works with allies to block Chinas access to vital equipment needed to keep its chip industry competitive, and Beijing restricts shipments from prominent U.S. firms including planemaker Boeing and chip company Micron Technology. Several analysts said on Wednesday that the reported move showed Beijing was not willing to spare any U.S. company in its push to reduce its dependence on American technologies. Even Apple is not immune ... in China where it employs hundreds of thousands, if not more than a million workers, to assemble its products through its relationship with Foxconn, D.A. Davidson analyst Tom Forte said. This should inspire companies to diversify both their supply chain and customer concentrations to be less dependent on China in the event the tensions get worse. China is one of Apples biggest markets and generates nearly a fifth of its revenue. No immediate impact is expected on earnings, however, considering the popularity of the iPhone in China, CFRA Research analyst Angelo Zino said. During a visit to China last week, U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said U.S. companies had complained to her that China had become uninvestible, pointing to fines, raids and other actions that have made it risky to do business in the worlds second-largest economy. The latest restriction by China mirrors similar bans taken in the United States against Chinese smartphone maker Huawei Technologies and short video platform TikTok, owned by Chinas ByteDance.

        "date": "September 6, 2023 09:35 pm",
        "content": "State Minister Geetha Kumarasinghe said that since it has been reported that children and women are mostly being used in begging, steps will be taken to curb this situation. Accordingly, the state minister also stated that she will hold a preliminary discussion with relevant institutions including the police, local authorities, and the National Child Protection Authority to curb this situation, the Parliamentary Communications Department reported. Attention was drawn to this when the Ministerial Consultative Committee on Women, Children Affairs and Social Empowerment met in the Parliament recently under the chairmanship of the State Ministers, Geetha Kumarasinghe and Anupa Pasqual, it said. It was discussed that the use of children and women for begging has become a business as it is common to hire children for begging, some children are given drugs and used for begging, and women pretend to be pregnant. Although there are legal provisions in this regard, attention was also paid to the issues of proper implementation at the practical level. The State Ministers directed the officials to take steps to get relevant data in connection with the survey of beggars in this country to be started by the Department of Social Services in September, according to the statement. Accordingly, it was further decided to prepare a special discussion about this in the coming week and take immediate action. Members of Parliament Piyankara Jayaratne, Sanjeeva Edirimanna, Muditha Prashanthi, Lalith Varankumara participated in this committee meeting, according to the Parliamentary Communications Department.",

        "title": "Moderna says updated COVID vaccine is effective against newer variant",
        "date": "September 6, 2023 10:09 pm",
        "content": "Moderna on Wednesday said clinical trial data showed its updated COVID-19 vaccine will likely be effective against the highly-mutated BA.2.86 subvariant of the coronavirus that has raised fears of a resurgence of infections. The company said its shot generated an 8.7-fold increase in neutralizing antibodies in humans against BA.2.86, which is being tracked by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). We think this is news people will want to hear as they prepare to go out and get their fall boosters, Moderna head of infectious diseases Jacqueline Miller said in an interview, adding that the data should also help reassure regulators. The CDC has previously indicated that BA.2.86 may be more capable of causing infection in people who previously had COVID or were vaccinated with previous shots. The Omicron offshoot carries more than 35 mutations in key portions of the virus compared with XBB.1.5, the dominant variant through most of 2023 and the target of the updated shots. Moderna said it had shared the new finding on its vaccine with regulators and submitted it for peer review publication. The retooled shot has yet to be approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, but is expected to be available later this month or in early October. The Massachusetts-based drugmaker and rival COVID-19 vaccine manufacturers Novavax and Pfizer with German partner BioNTech have created versions of their shots aimed at the XBB.1.5 subvariant. Last month, Moderna and Pfizer each said their new vaccines appeared to be effective against another new subvariant of concern dubbed EG.5 in initial testing. European regulators have since backed the PfizerBioNTech shot, with Britains Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency approving the vaccine on Tuesday, but have yet to make any announcements on Modernas updated vaccine. BA.2.86 has now been detected in Switzerland and South Africa as well as Israel, Denmark, the U.S. and Britain according to a WHO official. While it is important to monitor the variant, several experts told Reuters it is unlikely to cause a wave of severe disease and death because of immune defenses built up worldwide from mass vaccination and prior infection. Modernas shares rose marginally to 109.89 before the opening bell, erasing their premarket losses. Source  Reuters --Agencies",

        "content": "Inspirational captain Chamari Athapaththu led the way yet again as Sri Lankas womens team created history on Wednesday by recording their first-ever series triumph over England in any format. The historic 2-1 series triumph came courtesy of a dominant seven-wicket victory over Heather Knights side in the third T20I in Derby and it was no surprise to see Athapaththu dominate proceedings. Athapaththu picked up three valuable wickets to help skittle England for just 116 and then contributed an excellent 44 from just 28 deliveries to ensure Sri Lanka chased down the winning target with three overs to spare. It was no surprise that Athapaththu was adjudged Player of the Match and Player of the Series for her superb all-round performances, with the Sri Lanka captain totalling 114 runs and five wickets over the three matches. While Athapaththu is sure to win the majority of the plaudits for her fine all-round efforts, she received plenty of support from her teammates during the series decider as Sri Lanka bowled out England cheaply to gain the upper hand. Inoshi Priyadharshani (115) picked up the big wicket of Danni Wyatt from the first ball of the match and Udeshika Prabodhani (216) and Kavisha Dilhari (216) chipped in with a pair of scalps each as the hosts were dismissed from the final delivery of the penultimate over. Athapaththu blazed away early in reply to keep the ascendancy going the visitors way, with Harshitha Samarawickrama (26) offsetting the loss of the Sri Lanka captain in the seventh over to help guide the visitors home with ease. The two teams will now commence a three-game ODI series, with the first match commencing at Chester-le-Street on Saturday. -ICC",

        "title": "African leaders call for global carbon taxes to fight climate change",
        "date": "September 7, 2023 10:15 am",
        "content": "African leaders have proposed a global carbon tax regime in a joint declaration. The Nairobi Declaration capped the three-day Africa Climate Summit in Kenyas capital. The document, released on Wednesday, demanded that major polluters commit more resources to help poorer nations. African heads of state said they will use it as the basis of their negotiating position at Novembers COP28 summit. The African Climate Summit was dominated by discussions on how to mobilise financing to adapt to increasingly extreme weather, conserve natural resources and develop renewable energy. Africa is among the most vulnerable continents to the impact of climate change, but according to researchers, it only receives about 12 of the nearly 300bn (240bn) in annual financing it needs to cope. The Nairobi Declaration urged world leaders to rally behind the proposal for a global carbon taxation regime including a carbon tax on fossil fuel trade, maritime transport and aviation, that may also be augmented by a global financial transaction tax. It said such measures would ensure large-scale financing for climate-related investments and insulate the issue of tax rises from geopolitical and domestic political pressures. Around two dozen countries currently impose taxes on carbon, according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), but the idea of a global carbon tax regime has failed to gain much traction. On Tuesday, Kenyas President William Ruto referred to past proposals in the European Union for a financial transaction tax. Conservation groups in 2011 said money raised from the tax should finance environmental priorities, but the European Commissions proposal never won the unanimous approval required from the European Council to become law. Joab Bwire Okanda, a senior advisor at the Christian Aid charity, said the call for a global carbon tax was welcome but that to make polluters really pay, false solutions like carbon credits that allow polluters a free ride without taking meaningful action need to be consigned to the dustbin. Some activists say the credits, which allow polluters to offset emissions by funding green activities, are a pretext for big polluters to keep emitting carbon dioxide. Mr Ruto said international governments, development banks, private investors and philanthropists committed a combined 23bn (18bn) to green projects over the three days, including hundreds of millions to a major carbon markets initiative. But African leaders acknowledged that those kinds of investments only scratch the surface of the continents financial needs and said more systemic changes were needed. Some analysts said the summit had not focused enough on how to help Africans adapt to extreme weather. Protesters also criticised the conference, demonstrating outside the event against Africas plan to sell carbon credits to foreign countries. Several foreign companies and countries have committed hundreds of millions in carbon credit purchases from the Africa Carbon Markets Initiative (ACMI), including the United Arab Emirates, which pledged to buy 450m (358m).

Mexicos Supreme Court first said that it was unconstitutional to criminalize abortion in 2021, ruling against a law in the state of Coahuila, which threatened women who undergo abortions with up to three years prison and a fine.

        "date": "September 7, 2023 01:35 pm",
        "content": "Former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa on Thursday (Sept. 07) vehemently denied the allegations made against him in British television network Channel 4s new Dispatches documentary on the 2019 Easter Sunday bombings in Sri Lanka. In a media release, Rajapaksa said this video is mostly an anti-Rajapaksa tirade aimed at blackening the Rajapaksa legacy from 2005 onwards and is a tissue of lies just like the previous films broadcast by the same Channel. The statement comes a day after the British television network aired its production titled Sri Lankas Easter Bombings on the 2019 terror attacks that targeted several churches and luxury hotels in Sri Lanka, leaving more than 260 people dead and hundreds of others wounded. The Channel 4 expos√© made serious yet straightforward allegations against senior governmental officials, claiming that they were complicit in hatching a plan to create insecurity in the country in a bid to pave the way for Gotabaya Rajapaksa to win the 2019 presidential election. The former head of state said it is absurd to claim that a group of Islamic extremists carried out suicide attacks to make him President. He categorically rejected the allegations made by one of the high-placed whistleblowers interviewed by Channel 4, who said he had brokered a meeting between the members of Zahran Hashim-led Islamic extremist group National Thowheed Jamaath and then-army intelligence chief Major General Suresh Sallay in January 2018 prior to the carnage. The whistleblower, Hanzeer Azad Maulana, was once a spokesman for the LTTEs breakaway group Tamil Makkal Viduthalai Pullikal (TMVP) led by current State Minister of Rural Road Development Sivanesathurai Chandrakanthan alias Pillayan. Maulana, who has now sought political asylum in Switzerland, has reportedly presented his testimony to the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) and has also been interviewed by European intelligence agencies. Maulana told Channel 4 that he had witnessed the supposed meeting between the suicide bombers and the senior intelligence officer. However, Sallay has told Chanel 4 that after he was removed from the position of Director of Military Intelligence, he was serving in Malaysia as Minister-Counsellor from 2016 to December 2018 and that he had not been in Sri Lanka at the time the supposed clandestine meeting took place. Rajapaksa, in his media release, emphasized that he had had no contact with Sallay until he was elected president in 2019 after leaving his position as Defence Secretary in 2015. Despite the British television channel describing Sallay as one of his close aides, Rajapaksa denied the claim outright. Read former President Gotabaya Rajapaksas full statement below: The central allegation made in the latest film on Sri Lanka broadcast by Channel 4 is that the Easter Sunday suicide bombings of 21 April 2019 carried out by Islamic extremists had been deliberately facilitated in order to create the conditions to get me elected to power in November 2019. This charge hinges on claims made by one Hanzeer Azad Maulana, an applicant for political asylum in Europe, that he had introduced Maj. General Suresh Sallay (who is best known for his past role as the Director of Military Intelligence) to the principal suicide bomber Zaharan and his brother Zainee Moulavi in February 2018. Maj. Gen. Sallay has been described as one of my loyalists. However, he is a career military officer who has served under many Presidents and all military officers are loyal to the State and not to private individuals. I too was a former army officer, and like him, I too served under different governments. After leaving the position of Defence Secretary in 2015 and until I was elected President, Maj Gen Sallay and I had no contact at all. Maj Gen Sallay had informed Chanel 4 that he had been removed from the position of Director of Military Intelligence and was serving in Malaysia as Minister-Counsellor from 2016 to December 2018 and that he had not been in Sri Lanka at the time this meeting is said to have taken place. Furthermore, from January to November 2019 he was in India following the National Defence College course and during this entire period from 2016 to 2019, he was not operative within the defence or security structure of Sri Lanka. After Maj. Gen. Sallay was removed from Military Intelligence in 2016, he never served in that organisation again. It was only after I became President that he rejoined the intelligence apparatus as the head of the State Intelligence Service from December 2019 onwards. Hence this story about Maj Gen Sallay meeting the suicide bombers in February 2018 is clearly a fabrication. In order to bolster their claim that Military Intelligence was in league with the suicide bombers, the film alleges that when the police started investigating the Vavunativu incident of 30 November 2018 where two policemen were killed and their weapons stolen and the discovery of explosives at the Wanathawilluwa safe house on 16 January 2019, the Military Intelligence had sabotaged the police investigations. All Sri Lankans are aware that the government of 2015-2019 persecuted the intelligence services and particularly the Military Intelligence and that that quite a few of its members spent months and years in remand and in police custody during that period. Hence any claim that the Military Intelligence could sabotage police work during the 2015  2019 government, is plain nonsense. The Presidential Commission of Inquiry into the Easter Sunday bombings has stated quite clearly that signs of a Muslim extremist build-up were ignored by the government of 2015-2019. They stated that the revelation made by the then Justice Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe on 18 November 2016 that 32 Sri Lankans had gone to Syria and joined the ISIS terrorist group and that foreign Islamic preachers were coming to Sri Lanka to propagate extremist teachings had been ignored. The Easter Sunday suicide bombers had held training camps from 23 to 25 March 2018 at a guest house in Lewella and more gatherings had been held in April and May 2018 at a guest house in Nuwara Eliya all of which had been reported to the police but had not been investigated. Rilwan, the brother of Zaharan Hashim was seriously injured whilst experimenting with explosives in Kattankudy in the early hours of 27 August 2018. Apart from the Vavunativu and Wanathawilluwa incidents referred to earlier, there had been the vandalizing of Buddha statues in Mawanella in late December 2018 as well. As the Presidential Commission observed, the proper investigation of any one of these early incidents would have led to the early apprehension of the terrorists and the prevention of the suicide bombings. It was the police and not Military Intelligence that was in charge of these investigations. Apart from the fact that I was not in power during this entire period, like many members of the intelligence services and armed forces, I too was going from one police unit to another and from one courthouse to another from 2015 till I became President in November 2019 as a result of relentless government persecution. One of the allegations made against me and my government in this latest film is that after becoming President, I sabotaged the investigation by transferring officers carrying out the investigation. I assume that this is a reference to the former director of the CID Shani Abeysekera. Leaked telephone recordings had revealed that he had conspired with a politician to influence the outcome of an ongoing criminal case in the High Court, and he could not be kept in a position of responsibility in the CID under any circumstances by any government. The police officers attached to the Presidential Commission to investigate the Easter Sunday attacks were not transferred after I came into power. In any case, there was a gap of nearly seven months between the Easter Sunday attacks and my coming into power, and investigations should have been carried out during that period. SSP Abeysekera was also one of those responsible for the negligence between 2016 and 2019 mentioned in the Presidential Commissions report. Chanel 4 states that when the report of the Presidential Commission to investigate the Easter Sunday Attacks published its report, that I refused to make it public. That is an outright lie. Everyone in Sri Lanka knows that it has even been tabled in Parliament. Last year, when some people started linking me to the Easter Sunday bombings, I instructed Ambassador Mahinda Samarasinghe in Washington to explore the possibility of obtaining FBICIA assistance in investigations into the Easter Sunday bombings. On 7 April 2022, Christopher A. Landberg of the Bureau of Counterterrorism, U.S. Department of State wrote to Ambassador Samarasinghe stating the following: Thank you for raising with us Sri Lankas request for an independent investigation into the Easter Sunday attacks In the immediate aftermath of the attacks, and continuing to the present day, the U.S. government provided assistance in the investigation and prosecution of those responsible  to the point that the Department of Justice filed a criminal complaint in January 2021 against those deemed responsible for the deaths of U.S. citizens. In light of that, even as we stand ready to continue providing support to your government, it would not make sense for the United States to conduct an additional investigation into the attacksIn terms of our cooperation on this case, I would like to highlight that the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has worked closely with Sri Lankan law enforcement, and in the week after the attack, deployed approximately 33 personnel to Colombo to assist Sri Lankas Criminal Investigation Department with all aspects of their investigation. These efforts included evidence collection, witness and victim interviews, and exploitation of digital devices In this letter, Landberg also stated that if any additional requests were made by the Sri Lankan Attorney General they would be able to provide support from the two U.S. prosecutors, who were on the ground in Colombo at that time in April 2022. Earlier on 8 January 2021, the US Department of Justice had issued a media release stating among other things, that: three Sri Lankan citizens have been charged with terrorism offenses including conspiring to provide material support to a designated foreign terrorist organization (ISIS) The men were part of a group of ISIS supporters which called itself ISIS in Sri Lanka. That group is responsible for the 2019 Easter attacks in the South Asian nation of Sri Lanka, which killed 268 people including five U.S. citizens, and injured over 500 others Two days after the attacks. ISIS claimed credit for the terrorist acts, attributing the murders to Islamic State fighters. The criminal case filed on Dec. 11, 2020, in the U.S. District Court in Los Angeles is the result of a nearly two-year investigation by the FBI, which assisted Sri Lankan authorities in the wake of the suicide bombings that targeted Christian churches and luxury hotels frequented by Westerners. This latest film by Chanel 4 is mostly an anti-Rajapaksa tirade aimed at blackening the Rajapaksa legacy from 2005 onwards and is a tissue of lies just like the previous films broadcast by the same Channel. To claim that a group of Islamic extremists launched suicide attacks in order to make me President, is absurd. Despite the politically motivated accusations being made against me by certain individuals, I have personally done everything possible to help the Roman Catholic community when I held government office. After the war ended, I helped in the restoration and reconstruction of the Madhu Church and the Church in Mullikulam. I also helped facilitate the arrangements to invite His Holiness the Pope to Sri Lanka and I headed the committee formed by the then government to organize the visit. I also played a key role in the construction of the Benedict XVI Catholic Institution of Higher Education in Bolawalana. I worked very closely with His Eminence the Cardinal during that period.",

        "title": "President vows to implement strategy for modern commercial industrialization throughout Sri Lanka",
        "date": "September 7, 2023 03:14 pm",
        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe emphasized that by drawing inspiration from the success of the Biyagama Free Trade Zone, a comprehensive strategy for modern commercial industrialization will be implemented throughout the country. This initiative aims to propel the nation towards rapid development within the next 15-20 years, he said, participating in in the centenary celebration ceremony of Al Mubarak Central College on Wednesday afternoon (06 Sep.). The President highlighted that the once-underdeveloped Biyagama area has made remarkable progress, largely attributed to the establishment of the trade zone. His vision extends to transforming Sri Lanka into an attractive investment destination, thus creating a wealth of fresh opportunities for global investors. President Ranil also pointed out that several locations, including Bingiriya, Iranavila, Hambantota, Kandy, Trincomalee and the Northern Province, have already been identified for the establishment of industrial zones. The President affirmed the governments commitment to expedite this process, transforming these areas into thriving commercial cities. Furthermore, President Wickremesinghe underscored the dedication of elected representatives to bring investment prospects to their respective districts while refuting the notion that industrial zones were unsuitable for Sri Lanka, citing the success of the Biyagama investment zone as the best in South Asia. He emphasized that replicating such industrialization models in every province would alleviate economic pressures. President Wickremesinghe also emphasized the governments dual focus on strengthening the countrys economy through the creation of new investment zones and generating employment opportunities for the youth. During his visit to Malwana Al Mubarak Central College, President Ranil Wickremesinghe received a warm welcome from the students. To commemorate the colleges centenary, a commemorative stamp was issued and the foundation stone for a new three-story building was laid by the President. This historic visit marked the first time a sitting President visited Al Mubarak Central College, Malwana. President Ranil Wickremesinghe left a commemorative note in the special guest book, inaugurating the colleges centenary memorial. He also awarded gifts and certificates to students who demonstrated outstanding skills at the college. While addressing the gathering, President Wickremesinghe further expressed his gratitude for being invited to the centenary celebration of Malwana Al Mubarak College. He fondly remembered the schools evolution from its early days as Walgama College to its present status as Malwana College. He acknowledged his role in supporting the schools development and highlighted the importance of education in the Malwana community. President Wickremesinghe shared the communitys aspiration to provide quality education for their children, noting the significant progress Malwana College has achieved over the years. He also recalled his promise to create employment opportunities in the area when he first visited Malwana in 1977. Upon entering this region and initiating educational initiatives, the President also made a promise to provide employment opportunities to the local community. Recognizing the need for industrial development in the area, Former President J.R. Jayawardena expressed his desire to establish the Katunayake Free Trade Zone and create a second free zone. The residents of this province provided invaluable support when I embarked on my political journey, particularly after President J.R. Jayawardene entrusted me with the Biyagama constituency. The land required to establish this free trade zone was available only in this region. The coconut groves that eventually became the Biyagama Free Trade Zone originally belonged to the Muslims of Malwane. Remarkably, these individuals generously offered their land for this purpose, for which we arranged fair compensation. Concurrently, the Malwana area has experienced remarkable progress. Despite scepticism from some quarters that Sri Lanka was ill-suited for industrial endeavours, we forged ahead with our vision. Simultaneously, the infrastructure of this province underwent substantial development. Notably, the Kaduwela-Biyagama bridge and highways were constructed. Approximately five years ago, significant improvements began to take place in this area. Today, the Biyagama Trade Zone is acclaimed as the premier trading zone in South Asia. If the Katunayake and Biyagama trade zones were to merge, they would be unrivalled. Building upon the success of the Katunayake free trade zone, I also initiated the Seethawaka free trade zone to further promote industrialization. We launched Kaduwela factories, with Biyagama at its core, attracting foreign investments that have transformed the landscape. As I stand here today, I am reminded of a time when Bellakapapu junction had only two shops, but now it boasts numerous thriving businesses and substantial infrastructure development, including impressive buildings. In the present day, our region boasts a diverse range of factories, including a milk powder factory, a Coca-Cola factory, and even a beer factory. These industrial facilities have become significant sources of income for the local community. Today, the region is thriving, with no signs of economic distress. The remarkable development we see today is not limited to this area alone but extends to neighbouring regions like Kadawata, where transformation is evident from Kiribathgoda to Dalugama, turning Sapugaskanda into a bustling hub. The residents of Makola take pride in the prosperity they now enjoy, a situation vastly different from the past. I recall a time when the tire corporation faced closure due to financial losses. However, we resolved to revitalize and develop it, despite facing substantial opposition and negative campaigns against my efforts. Today, not only do we manufacture tires for local consumption, but we also export them. Numerous other factories have sprung up, further fuelling the growth of Biyagama and Kelaniya, now recognized as expansive commercial and industrial estates. An industrial park of the magnitude of Biyagama is unparalleled elsewhere in Sri Lanka. We aspire to expand upon this success and foster new developments in the area. Additionally, plans are underway to establish a new hospital at the Bellakapapu junction. In these trying times when our nations economy has faced challenges, we have attracted significant foreign investments to aid in its recovery. Ambitious plans are in motion to establish trade zones in numerous locations akin to Biyagama. Members of Parliament have been entrusted with the task of seeking investors and promoting the development of their respective regions. These initiatives must be diligently pursued. Had trade zones like Biyagama and Katunayake been replicated throughout Sri Lanka, we would have been better equipped to navigate our current economic difficulties. Drawing inspiration from the example set by Biyagama, we are fervently advancing large-scale industrialization, with the aim of transforming Biyagama, Kelaniya, Kadawata and other areas into thriving modern commercial economies. Suitable areas for development have already been identified in Bingiriya, Iranavila, Hambantota, Kandy, Trincomalee and the Northern Province. By extending similar facilities to these regions, we aspire to catalyse rapid development across the entire island within the next 15-20 years. Our commitment to these plans is unwavering as we endeavour to bolster our nations economic foundation. Generating revenue is imperative to manage our debts effectively. Through these concerted efforts, we are working tirelessly to emulate the progress achieved by countries like Vietnam, Thailand and Malaysia. The Minister of State for Education, Aravinda Kumar also delivered remarks during the ceremony. In addition to the President, State Ministers Prasanna Ranaweera and Kader Mastan were in attendance, alongside the Principal of Al Mubarak Central College, Mr. S.H.M. Naim, staff, past and present students and other officials graced the occasion with their presence.",

        "title": "Mexico likely to get first woman president after top parties choose 2 female candidates",
        "date": "September 7, 2023 04:54 pm",
        "content": "With the selection of former Mexico City Mayor Claudia Sheinbaum as the candidate of the countrys ruling party in next Junes election, Mexico will for the first time have time two women from its main political movements competing for the presidency. Sheinbaum, as well as the opposition candidate X√≥chitl G√°lvez, have insisted that Mexico is ready to be led by a woman, but it will not be an easy path. On Wednesday night, President Andr√©s Manuel L√≥pez Obradors Morena party announced that Sheinbaum had defeated five internal party rivals  all men. L√≥pez Obrador has put women in important positions in his Cabinet and been a mentor for Sheinbaum, even while being accused at times of male chauvinism. Mexico still has famously intense machismo or male chauvinism, expressed in its most extreme form in a high rate of femicides, but also daily in hundreds of more subtle ways. Mexico has a strong macho vote, said Gloria Alcocer Olmos, director of the electoral magazine Voice and Vote, adding that it is not exclusive to male voters. Alcocer Olmos noted that in Junes gubernatorial election in the state of Mexico  the countrys most populous jurisdiction  the race was between two female candidates and turnout was the lowest in history. The same thing occurred in the state election in Aguascalientes in 2021, she said. What does that tell us? she asked. That the people are voting for women? The reality is that no, and the saddest thing is that women themselves are not voting for women. Such low turnout in the June 2 presidential election is less likely because so much is at stake, Alcocer Olmos said. There is also the possibility that the Citizen Movement party, which controls Nuevo Leon and Jalisco  two of the most economically important states  could nominate a male candidate who would attract that macho vote, she said. Another question mark is what former Foreign Affairs Secretary Marcelo Ebrard will do. As Sheinbaums closest rival in Morena he did not accept the results of the internal party selection process, claiming there were irregularities. Morena controls 22 of Mexicos 32 states and L√≥pez Obrador remains highly popular, giving Sheinbaum a strong advantage. But G√°lvez emerged from virtual obscurity, helped largely by daily public criticism from L√≥pez Obrador, to become the consensus candidate of the largely directionless opposition. Aurora Pedroche, a Morena activist who supports Sheinbaum, suggested another problem should one of the female candidates win the presidency. Given the greatly increased power and responsibility that L√≥pez Obrador has given the military during his administration how are they going to accept a woman as commander in chief? That scares me, Pedroche said. While Mexican women have advanced to positions of political power in public life  in part because of required representation quotas for public office -- women suffer from high levels of gender violence. Femicides  cases of women killed because of their gender  have been a persistent problem for decades. Sheinbaum represents continuation of L√≥pez Obradors social agenda, but without his charisma to take on an opponent in G√°lvez who has an ease of connecting with people that is more reminiscent of the outgoing president. The independent G√°lvez is representing the Broad Front for Mexico, a coalition of the conservative National Action Party, the small progressive Democratic Revolution Party, and the old-guard Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, that held Mexicos presidency without interruption between 1929 and 2000. G√°lvez caucuses with the National Action Party in the Senate but is not a member. Strategist Antonio Sola, who worked on the 2006 campaign of former President Felipe Calder√≥n and later with one of the parties that helped L√≥pez Obrador win, thinks G√°lvezs outsider image could help her. With much of the world experiencing the end of a political era dominated by traditional candidates, the emerging figures are those who are kicking the system, he said.

Despite his emphasis that the relevant investigation would be an international probe and not a domestic one, the Minister opined skepticism pertaining to Channel 4s recent expos√© on the Easter bombings, claiming that diaspora groups were often seen publishing such controversial videos against Sri Lanka ahead of the annual sessions of the United Nations Human Rights Conference (UNHRC). Dr. Rajapakshe made these remarks during a media conference held at the ministrys premises this afternoon (07 Sep.) to brief the public on the new Anti-Corruption Act. Accordingly, the Minister accused the British television channel of being a pro-diaspora institution. Despite these claims, however, he assured that a comprehensive investigation would be carried out into the claims made in the documentary. Speaking further, the Minister of Justice stated that when he, during a parliamentary speech, warned the public of such possibilities and that the ISIS was recruiting Sri Lankan youth for training programmes, his words fell on deaf ears. I made a statement in parliament related to the matter 29 months before the Easter attacks.I was accused of trying to create disharmony and trying to turn the country into a pool of blood But 29 months later, everyones eyes were opened to the truth, the Minister said in this regard. Speaking with regards to UKs Channel 4s most recent and heavily controversial expos√© on the series of bombings that shook Sri Lanka on 21 April 2019, Minister Rajapakshe accused the British TV channel of working with diasporas, further claiming that the institution was not one that sought justice for the victims of the attack.",

        "date": "September 7, 2023 10:17 pm",
        "content": "The boss of Japans biggest pop talent agency has resigned after finally admitting the sexual abuse committed by its late founder, Johnny Kitagawa. Julie Fujishima resigned from Johnny and Associates on Thursday during a public apology to her uncles victims. Her departure comes a week after investigators found Kitagawa abused hundreds of boys and young men over six decades, as head of the boyband agency. A BBC documentary this year about the abuse led more victims to come forward. Johnny Kitagawa died in 2019, having always denied wrongdoing. He never faced charges. On Thursday, his niece and outgoing chief executive Ms Fujishima acknowledged his abuse for the first time. Both the agency itself and I myself as a person recognise that sex abuse by Johnny Kitagawa took place, she said. I apologise to his victims from the bottom of my heart. Local media showed some of the victims watching the news conference, some looking visibly angry. At a news conference in Tokyo after Ms Fujishima spoke, some of Kitagawas victims said they thought her remarks had been sincere and had helped them - but there was a long way to go. Rumours and some media reports of his abuse had been known for years, but no concrete action was taken. The pop mogul never faced criminal prosecution and continued recruiting and training teenage boys until his death four years ago, at the age of 87. His death was a national event, and even the prime minister at the time sent condolences. And even though some of the allegations were proven in a civil court when he was alive, Kitagawa successfully sued for defamation on at least one occasion. Most mainstream Japanese media also did not cover the allegations for decades, prompting accusations of an industry cover-up. Then in March, the BBCs investigation detailing Kitagawas abuse was aired, sparking discussion across Japan and calls for a full investigation. Thousands of J-pop fans also signed a petition lobbying for an inquiry into the agency. The documentary detailed allegations from victims who worked for the all-male agency when they were teenagers. It showed a pattern of exploitation, with the abuse taking place at Kitagawas luxury homes, and often witnessed by other boys. The BBCs coverage compelled more victims to come forward, including ex-pop star Kauan Okamoto who said that he had been abused by Kitagawa for four years, from the age of 15. Public pressure led to the agency then launching its own independent investigation. The panel, composed of Japans former prosecutor general Makoto Hayashi, a psychiatrist and a clinical psychologist, interviewed 41 people, including 23 victims as well as Ms Fujishima. In the final report released last week, they found Kitagawa started sexually abusing boys in the 1950s, through the 1960s when Johnny and Associates was set up, until the 2010s. They also found that the agencys family management had allowed the abuse to persist for decades. Investigators said Ms Fujishima - a long-time executive in the company - failed to address the allegations despite her knowledge of them Ms Fujishima had initially been against an independent investigation. In May, she apologised to victims but stopped short of saying individual allegations were true, and claimed not to have known about her uncles actions at the time. On Thursday, she named as her successor Noriyuki Higashiyama, a household television name in Japan. The 56-year-old was also one of the first talents recruited by Johnny and Associates. Mr Higashiyama said he had never been a victim of Kitagawas abuse but had been aware of the rumours. I couldnt, and didnt, do anything about it, he told the news conference. He also acknowledged public calls for the agencys name to be changed- but said no immediate action would be taken. There was talk at the press conference of structural change and many observers believe the organisation is likely to make amends - but its unclear what that change would look like and how the agencys talents would be managed and protected. There are also big questions about the future of Johnny and Associates as a brand that has been synonymous with fame and glamour, and which has now been so badly and so publicly disgraced.

        "date": "September 7, 2023 10:19 pm",
        "content": "The Minister of State for Home Affairs, Ashoka Priyantha said swift action will be taken to fill nearly 4,000 vacant Grama Niladhari positions. Additionally, he noted the formation of a committee led by Mr. Anura Dissanayake, the Prime Ministers Secretary, to address this issue. Furthermore, Mr. Ashoka Priyantha shared that the e-GN program, aimed at digitizing all 14,022 Grama Seva domains across the country, is already in progress. These statements were made during a press conference at the Presidential Media Centre today, under the theme Collective Path to a stable country. Minister of State for Home Affairs, Ashoka Priyantha further said; Balancing the public service is essential, taking into account various factors, including the countrys economic situation. This should be carried out without regard to ones position, but its crucial to recognize that there are job openings in specific districts, regions and organizations. Presently, the government has adopted a policy of suspending recruitment. However, there is a considerable number of vacancies for Grama Niladhari officers. The absence of Grama Niladhari Officers, who operate at the village level, poses challenges in moving forward. Therefore, our current efforts are focused on filling the four thousand vacant Grama Niladhari positions. This matter has been referred to the committee headed by Mr. Anura Dissanayake, the Prime Ministers Secretary, for resolution. When President Ranil Wickremesinghe assumed loffice, our primary task was to create an environment conducive to the well-being of the people. Thanks to the Presidents visionary decisions after taking office, we have been able to achieve significant economic improvements for the countrys citizens within just one year. In particular, we have established food security and nutrition committees. After the central operating committee of the Presidential Secretariat was formed, food security and nutrition committees were established at the provincial and district levels, as well as at the divisional secretariat level, covering all 14,022 Grama Seva domains. Furthermore, the e-GN Grama Seva domain system has been implemented across the entire island. Ninety percent of these systems are operational in the Kalutara district, with fifty percent in Puttalam. This program has also been introduced in seven districts and data collection is underway in others. Consequently, we aim to digitize all 14,022 Grama Seva Domains in the near future.",

Many more were wounded, it added in a statement read on national television, noting that the death toll was provisional. Insurgents attacked a boat carrying civilians across the flooded plains that separate the towns of Gao and Mopti during the rainy season. The vessel was traveling from Gao when it was hit. Assailants also attacked a military camp in the Bourem Circle, an administrative subdivision of the Gao region in Malis northeast. Around 50 assailants were killed in response and three days of national mourning declared, the interim government said. Mali is one of several West African countries battling a violent insurgency with links to al Qaeda and Islamic State that took root in its arid north in 2012. Militants have gained ground, spreading across the Sahel and to coastal West African nations, despite costly international efforts to support local troops. Thousands have been killed and over six million displaced across the Sahel region south of the Sahara. Frustrations about growing insecurity spurred two military takeovers in Mali and two in Burkina Faso since 2020 - four of eight coups to hit West and Central Africa over the past three years.

        "date": "September 8, 2023 11:29 am",
        "content": "US actor Danny Masterson has been sentenced to serve 30 years to life in prison for raping two women. Masterson starred on That 70s Show, a TV series that was airing at the time of his crimes in the early 2000s. Prosecutors argued Masterson, 47, had relied on his status as a prominent Scientologist to avoid accountability. Judge Charlaine Olmedo allowed the victims of his crimes to read impact statements in court ahead of his sentencing. Prominent former Scientologist and actress Leah Remini attended Thursdays hearing and comforted the women before and after they delivered their statements. I wished I had reported him earlier to the police, one of the women said, according to US media. Another woman told Masterson: I forgive you. Your sickness is no longer mine to bear, according to Reuters. Masterson remained silent throughout the hearing. As the judge read his sentence - the maximum penalty allowed - his wife, Bijou Phillips, was seen in court breaking down in tears. Masterson was found guilty in May at a re-trial after the first jury was unable to reach a verdict in 2022. Following his conviction, Masterson was deemed a flight risk and was taken into prison custody. The actor was convicted after three women testified that he had sexually assaulted them at his Hollywood home from 2001-03 - during the height of his television fame. The jury heard testimony that he had given them drugs before he assaulted them. He was found guilty of rape against two of his three accusers. The charges brought by the third accuser were declared a mistrial and prosecutors said they do not plan to retry the case. Alison Anderson, a lawyer representing two of the victims, said in a statement sent to BBC News that the women have displayed tremendous strength and bravery, by coming forward to law enforcement and participating directly in two gruelling criminal trials. Despite persistent harassment, obstruction and intimidation, these courageous women helped hold a ruthless sexual predator accountable today, she said. Throughout the trial, prosecutors argued that the Church of Scientology had helped cover up the assaults - an allegation the organisation has categorically denied. At the time of the attacks, Masterson and all three of his accusers were Scientologists. Several of the women said it took them years to come forward because Church of Scientology officials discouraged them from reporting the rape to police. Scientology officials told one survivor she would lose her membership of the community unless she signed a non-disclosure agreement and accepted a payment of 400,000 (320,000), according to prosecutors. During the trial, Judge Olmedo allowed both sides to discuss the dogma and practices of Scientology, angering the organisation. In its statement after the verdict in May, the Church of Scientology said there was not a scintilla of evidence supporting the scandalous allegations that the Church harassed the accusers. In court on Thursday, one woman described being shunned by her mother, who is still a practising Scientologist. She texted me and told me to never contact her again, she said, reported the LA Times. She had warned me ahead of time she wanted to see Danny Masterson locked away for what hed done to me, but not at the expense of her religion. Another woman said she had been victimised by the Church of Scientology ever since she spoke out. Since the week I came forward to police I have been terrorised, harassed and had my privacy invaded daily by the cult of Scientology for almost seven years now, she said, adding: But I dont regret it. Masterson was first accused of rape in 2017 during the height of the MeToo movement. He denied the accusations and said each of the encounters was consensual. Charges came after a three-year investigation by the Los Angeles Police Department. Prosecutors did not file charges in two other cases because of insufficient evidence and the statute of limitations expiring. Thursdays sentencing was also attended by Jessica Barth, who founded Voices in Action in the wake of the MeToo movement. Ms Barth was one of the women to publicly accuse disgraced Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein of abuse. Her non-profit works to encourage others to come forward and report abuse. Before the hearing, a motion for a new trial by Mastersons defence team was denied by the judge, according to an Los Angeles court official. Source - BBC --Agencies",

        "date": "September 8, 2023 01:35 pm",
        "content": "Fitch Ratings has affirmed Sri Lankas Long-Term Foreign Currency Issuer Default Rating at Restricted Default or RD. In a statement on Friday (Sept. 08), the global credit rating agency said the countrys reserves levels will influence the rating only once it has moved it out of RD. Despite an increase in reserves over the last nine months to around USD3.8 billion in July 2023, they remain well below the USD7.3 billion average over 2014-2019, Fitch said further. Fitch Ratings says the reserve dynamic among APAC (Asia-Pacific) sovereigns appears to be diverging, with potential implications for their credit profiles. The New York-based agency added that some central banks have been able to accumulate reserves on current account improvements or investment inflows, while others still see their currencies under pressure from US Fed tightening prospects. Official reserves among Fitch-rated sovereigns in APAC increased by almost USD 170 billion in the first half of 2023, mostly driven by growth among those with already large reserve buffers, including China (AStable), Singapore (AAAStable), India (BBB-Stable), Japan (AStable) and Taiwan (AAStable). Strong external liquidity positions support these sovereigns credit profiles, but further reserve increases are unlikely to have much near-term influence on ratings. Several sovereigns in ASEAN, including Indonesia (BBBStable), Malaysia (BBBStable), the Philippines (BBBStable) and Thailand (BBBStable), saw reserves decline over 2Q23, which may in some cases reflect intervention to support currencies. The changes have been marginal so far, not influencing credit profiles significantly, but currency pressure may continue until the Fed finishes raising rates. Reserve dynamics may have a greater impact for frontier market sovereigns, especially where reserve coverage ratios are low and external liquidity positions fragile. In our most recent rating assessments, we stated that external finance factors, potentially including marked or sustained declines in foreign exchange reserves, could be a driver of negative rating action in sovereigns such as Bangladesh (BB-Stable), the Maldives (B-Negative), Mongolia (BStable) and Vietnam (BBPositive). Official reserves have fallen by around 29 in the Maldives over January-July 2023, reversing the improvement in reserves in late 2022 following the conclusion of a USD 200 million bilateral currency swap with India. Bangladesh improved reserve transparency with the adoption of IMF definitions in June. IMF data show its reserves declined 31 over January-July, but we estimate the decline could be around 16 if the new definitions applied throughout the period. By contrast, reserves in Mongolia and Vietnam climbed over the first half of 2023. Official reserves rose by 3 in Vietnam over January-May 2023 (most recent available data), after falling 21 in 2022. The modest increase partly reflects a widening of the goods trade surplus in the first half of 2023, as weaker domestic demand has curbed imports, offsetting the effects of a continued contraction in exports. Fitch Ratings says at USD 3.9 billion in August, Mongolias reserves remain below the historic peak of USD 4.9 billion seen in the second quarter of 2021, but have risen significantly from their recent low of USD 2.7 billion in August 2022. This partly reflects strong growth in exports over 2H22 and 1H23, as well as Mongolias USD 450 million bond issue and a USD 200 million exchange and tender offer in January 2023. Larger reserve buffers should reduce Mongolias external financing vulnerabilities. Nevertheless, these will still be significant in light of the countrys high net external debt burden and our projections for further current-account deficits in 2023-2025. Pakistans reserves have risen by around USD 3.8 billion in July after the country agreed to a nine-month Stand-by Arrangement with the IMF. We upgraded Pakistans rating to CCC, from CCC- in July, on the assumption that the IMF deal would catalyse other funding and anchor policy around the parliamentary elections. A rebuilding of reserves and easing of external financing risks could increase upward pressure on Pakistans rating. However, the political climate remains volatile and we view risks to IMF programme implementation and external funding as high amid Pakistans large external financing requirement.",

        "title": "Administrative weaknesses, irregularities of Ports Authority brought to light at COPE",
        "date": "September 8, 2023 01:39 pm",
        "content": "The Sri Lanka Port Authority (SLPA) had been called before the Committee on Public Enterprises (COPE) on Tuesday (05), where many administrative weaknesses and irregularities of the authority were revealed. The committee chaired by MP Ranjith Bandara has asked SLPA officials that a proposal be submitted to the COPE within 03 months regarding increasing revenue, cost management and increasing efficiency of the Sri Lanka Ports Authority. The COPE Chair recommended that the Ports Authority be summoned before COPE back on December 08, 2023, and mentioned that the 03 proposals pertaining to revenue enhancement, cost management and efficiency enhancement of the authority should be submitted on the relevant date. Meanwhile, the financial results of the Ports Authority in the past few years were taken into discussion, the Parliamentary Communications Department said, adding that the committee questioned the officials present regarding the non-payment of Rs. 4.975 million of the profit earned by the SLPA from 2016 to 2021 which was to be credited to the Consolidated Fund. In response, the SLPA officials have given an undertaking to take measures to pay this amount within two months. The committee further questioned the officials about failing to make amendments to the contract of the USD 282.56 million reached with the contractor to purchase 12 large cranes and 40 automatic gantry cranes to maximize the operational capacity of the eastern terminal. The Members of Parliament present pointed out that this was also discussed when the SLPA was summoned before COPE on June 22, 2022. The officials present mentioned that contracts were reached on the said in the year 2021 and despite the issuance of Letter of Credit (LC) by the Bank of Ceylon, these payments could not be made due to the countrys economic situation. The COPE Chair mentioned that due to the non-amendment of this contract, legal issues may arise in the future, adding that operational cost too has been spent on this. As a result, COPE recommended that a report be submitted on this said within a month. Moreover, COPE pointed out that according to the reports of the Auditor General, it was observed that the container handling capacity of SLPA at the Colombo Port has decreased from 81 to 28 by 2022. Furthermore, the committee members pointed out that the Western Terminal has been working to increase the income through the activities of private investors. As a result, COPE pointed out that the ability to compete with the private sector should also be created. The Committee was also looked into the preparation of a comprehensive plan for the next 5 years. The SLPA officials pointed out that 50 of the comprehensive plans prepared for the next 5 years have been completed. The officials further agreed to present this plan to the Committee when the Authority is called before COPE again, the Parliamentary Communications Department mentioned. COPE also drew attention to the decrease in the arrival of naval vessels at the ports of Colombo, Galle and Trincomalee between 2018 and 2022. COPE also questioned as to why not a single ship docked at the port of Kankesanthurai in the year 2020. The officials pointed out that though there was a decrease in the year 2022, it is getting better now. The officials mentioned that the ports other than the Colombo port were used to import raw materials such as cement and the reason for this was the decrease in importing these raw materials over the past few years. Thus, the Committee instructed the SLPA officials to focus on further activating the existing ports at the provincial levels. There was also a discussion about the plan to build a multi-purpose terminal at the Galle port and the fact that the project had to be suspended due to the 3-year delay in obtaining approval from UNESCO. On March 28, 2006, the Sri Lankan government and the Japan Bank for International Cooperation signed a loan agreement in this regard and it was necessary to obtain the approval of UNESCO to carry out the construction in the proximity of Galle Fort, which is designated as a world heritage. Given that this approval had not been obtained for over 3 years, it has been decided to suspend this project. However, the Committee pointed out that the consultant fee of Rs. 418 million spent for this purpose is observed as a net expense. The officials pointed out that as priority was given to the development of Hambantota port, the attention on Galle port diminished. However, they mentioned that this money is not an idle expenditure as they hope to develop the Galle port as a tourist spot in the future. The officials also mentioned that the Ports Authority has not been affiliated with the said matter. It was revealed that there are 914 excess employees in the Port Authority. Given the context, COPE pointed out that overtime allowances have been given to the employees. COPE also pointed out that it is observed that money has been given as overtime allowances in the year 2021 as well. Further, COPE instructed the Department of Management Services to pay attention to the excess number of employees and take necessary action. The Committee instructed to resolve the issue related to the number of employees before reappearing before the Committee. An inquiry was made regarding the non-installation of CCTV cameras covering all the gates and bonded warehouses of the Sri Lanka Port Authority. The officials present responded that CCTV cameras would be gradually installed, pointing out that 538 cameras have been installed so far and about 400 will be installed in the future. The officials present said that they intend to install these CCTV cameras within 6 months. COPE also inquired about the Night Navigation system at Trincomalee port not functioning at its maximum capacity. It was disclosed that 1.2 billion rupees have been spent on food for the year 2022. Accordingly, the Auditor General mentioned that 498 million rupees have been spent on snacks. Then, it was decided to summon SLPA officials again on December 08, 2023, to review the progress of these recommendations. State Ministers Jagath Pushpakumara, Janaka Wakkumbura, Members of Parliament Mahindananda Aluthgamage, Dayasiri Jayasekara, Rohitha Abegunawardhana, Eran Wickramaratne, S. M. Marikkar, Sanjeeva Edirimanna, Jagath Kumara Sumithraarachchi, Madhura Withanage and Prof. Charitha Herath were present at the Committee meeting held. The Auditor Generals report for the year 2021 and the current performance were examined and the Secretary of the Ministry of Ports, Naval and Aviation Services K. D. S. Ruwanchandra, SLPA Chairman Keith D. Bernard and a group of officials were summoned before this Committee. Moreover, the progress of implementing the recommendations made to the SLPA when its officials were summoned before COPE on June 22, 2022 was also examined.",

The decision will be delivered after taking into consideration a petition filed by the parliamentarian. On Wednesday (06), the General Secretary of SLFP MP Dayasiri Jayasekara was removed from the post and stripped of his party membership.

In addition, a disciplinary inquiry against Jayasekara is planned to be conducted pursuant to the provisions of the partys constitution. The letter also mentioned that the disciplinary charges leveled against Jayasekara would be forwarded to him in writing within 14 days. However, addressing concerns pertaining to MP Dayasiri Jayasekaras removal, party leader and former President Maithripala Sirisena had stated that the party membership was only temporarily suspended, owing to a number of reasons. The former President further asserted that the SLFP was ready to accept the MP as a party member, or any other title he may wish to hold within the part, except that of the SLFP General Secretary.",

Accordingly, the Inland Revenue (Amendment) Act No. 14 of 2023 and the Social Security Contribution Levy (Amendment) Act No. 15 of 2023 will come into effect from today. The two Bills were passed in parliament on Thursday (Sept. 07) following a two-day debate which commenced on Wednesday (Sept. 06). At the end of the debate, a division was called for the Inland Revenue (Amendment) Bill, which received 103 votes in favour and 58 against. Amendments were added to the Bill during the Committee Stage and the third reading of the Bill was passed without a vote. Meanwhile, the Social Security Contribution Levy (Amendment) Bill too was passed in parliament, but without a vote. On Tuesday (Sept. 05), Speaker of Parliament Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena communicated the Supreme Courts determination on the Inland Revenue (Amendment) Bill. The top court had determined that the bill should be passed by a simple majority in parliament, while maintaining that neither the bill, which was challenged in court, nor any of its provisions are inconsistent with Article 12 or any provisions of the Constitution. Last week, the Supreme Court concluded the deliberations of the petitions filed challenging the Inland Revenue (Amendment) Draft Bill, which was presented to the parliament by the government. The petitions had been filed by two persons including Chaturanga Abeysinghe, an activist of the National Peoples Power (NPP), alleging that if passed in parliament, the proposed bill will revise a number of levies and will also further empower the Inland Revenue Department as the primary agent for collecting taxes and dealing with issues arising with taxes on behalf of the government.",

        "date": "September 8, 2023 05:26 pm",
        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe has submitted to the Cabinet the Defence Review  2030, which not only analyses the current regional challenges but also outlines a roadmap for the future. Sri Lankas commitment to safeguarding its freedom and sovereignty has been reaffirmed with the release of the Defence Review  2030 by the Head of State, the Presidents Media Division (PMD) said, adding that the comprehensive document outlines the evolving security landscape in the Indian Ocean region and sets the course for Sri Lankas defence policy in the coming years. The President has proposed the Defence Review  2030 at the recent Cabinet meeting, according to the PMD. The key principles of Sri Lankas defence policy after gaining independence have always revolved around protecting its sovereignty, avoiding military alliances, refraining from conflicts in the Indian Ocean, countering non-state actors adverse to Sri Lanka and contributing to global peace. However, the security dynamics have witnessed a significant shift. The PMD says previously, Sri Lankas primary focus was on combating internal terrorism, notably the LTTE, adding that today, the strategic environment has grown more complex, marked by great power rivalries between the United States and China, the emergence of strategic alliances such as the Quad and AUKUS, the Ukraine war and the omnipresent threat of climate change. Given this evolving landscape, the Defence Review - 2030 serves as a crucial step to adapt Sri Lankas defence policy, the PMD added. The review not only analyses the current regional challenges but also outlines a roadmap for the future, encompassing both the immediate future and steps beyond 2030. Key components of the defence review include:  Strategic vision and challenges for Sri Lanka in 2030.  Security interests of Sri Lanka.  Defence Policy Objectives for 2030.  Power Posture and Power Structure to address strategic challenges.  Prioritization of urgent needs within the constraints of the existing financial situation. To spearhead this endeavour, President Wickremesinghe has appointed a distinguished review team chaired by Major General Channa Gunathilake (Retd). Rear Admiral J. J. Ranasinghe (Retd), Major General P.R. Wanigasooriya (Retd.), Air Vice Marshal Andrew Wijesuriya (Retd.), Miss Sasikala Premawardena from the Sri Lanka Foreign Service and Daniel Alphonsus, the adviser for Finance and Economic Stabilization meanwhile serve as the members of the said team. The group will receive support from military personnel on active duty, Foreign Service officials, Treasury officials and experts in relevant fields. This defence review marks the initial step toward formulating a comprehensive national defence policy, reflecting Sri Lankas commitment to safeguarding its sovereignty and contributing to global peace in an ever-changing world, according to the PMD.",

        "date": "September 8, 2023 07:23 pm",
        "content": "Record-breaking rainfall paralyzed much of Hong Kong on Friday, with flash flooding submerging metro stations and trapping drivers on roads, as authorities suspended schools and urged the public to seek safe shelter. Photos and videos showed residents wading through murky brown floodwaters as heavy rain continued to inundate the densely populated city of 7.5 million. In some low-lying areas, streets were transformed into surging torrents, with authorities forced to rescue motorists stuck in their vehicles. The deluge began late Thursday night, with the Hong Kong Observatory recording more than 158 millimeters (6.2 inches) in rain between 11 p.m. and midnight, the highest hourly rainfall since records began in 1884, the government said in a news release. Some parts of city saw almost 500 mm (19.7 inches) of rainfall in 24 hours, according to online weather data site OGimet. The extreme conditions caught many residents by surprise and came just days after Hong Kong was lashed by its strongest typhoon in five years. Typhoon Saola, originally a super typhoon, weakened to the equivalent of a Category 2 hurricane as it reached Hong Kong last weekend  but was still potent enough to shut down the city and cause hundreds of flight cancellations. Eighty-six people were injured from the typhoon, the government said. Fridays deluge again caused widespread transport and business disruptions across the financial hub, with the stock market canceling morning trading, and all schools closed for the day. On Friday, authorities appealed to businesses to allow non-essential employees to stay at home or seek safe shelter, citing unsafe travel conditions. Stuart Hargreaves, a Hong Kong resident and professor, was forced to spend the night in his car after being stranded while driving home late Thursday. The flooded roads were impassable, he said; at one point, water was coming over the hood of the car and I thought it was going to flood the engine. Several other cars had similarly flooded and were floating nearby, he said. He managed to park in a safe place, but there was no way out  leaving him stuck until daybreak. When he managed to drive home nine hours later, the road was full of rocks from landslides, debris from trees, abandoned cars and so on, he said. As of Friday afternoon, 119 people have been reported injured from the downpour, four of whom are in serious condition, according to Hong Kongs Hospital Authority. The government said Friday that such extreme conditions were expected to continue until at least midnight. The citys Mass Transit Railway announced it would suspend services on one of its lines after a station in the Wong Tai Sin district was flooded, with footage shared widely online showing floodwater gushing down the stairs. Another video shows workers at a different station up to their knees in water, struggling at the entrance to keep the flooding at bay. While most other subway operations remained open, all major bus, tram and ferry services were suspended, according to public broadcaster RTHK. And although some bus services resumed Friday afternoon, many routes remain closed or diverted. Multiple roads were also closed off due to the threat of landslides in the mountainous territory, with authorities issuing the highest black rainstorm warning for the first time in two years. Videos from Thursday evening show floodwater entering the first floors of some buildings and shopping malls, with chairs and debris scattered across the floor. The government also warned there may be a risk of flooding in its northern New Territories district, which is adjacent to the Chinese mainland, after the neighboring city of Shenzhen said it would release water from a reservoir. The downpours in Shenzhen also broke multiple rain records in the city, including the maximum rainfall records over two-hour, three-hour, six-hour and 12-hour periods, which have stood since 1952, according to Chinese state media. Shenzhen saw 469 millimeters (about 18.5 inches) of rain from 5 p.m. Thursday to 6 a.m. Friday, with kindergartens, primary and secondary schools shut on Friday, state media reported. Transport was disrupted there, too, with six subway lines suspended. Source - CNN --Agencies",

        "date": "September 8, 2023 07:54 pm",
        "content": "Global creditors will discuss the inclusion of domestic debt in restructuring plans for countries in default next week, two sources with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters, a sign progress after months of delays. The Sept. 15 technical meeting of the Global Sovereign Debt Roundtable will include representatives, likely at deputy level, of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank and Group of 20 (G20) major economies. The talks will also cover the risks of local debt restructuring, such as second-round effects, said one of the two sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity. They are expected to prepare the ground for a more high level reunion during the October IMF-World Bank meetings in Morocco on Oct. 9-15. Countries such as Sri Lanka and Ghana recently included part or all of its domestic sovereign debt in ongoing debt restructurings after falling in default, though Zambia did not. There is no common restructuring template for countries in default, with governments often deciding on how to treat local debt in the wake of an IMF debt sustainability analysis. Overseas private creditors often push for burden sharing with domestic creditors during such debt restructurings. Governments tend to be reluctant over concerns that such a move could lead to instability in their financial sector, as domestic banks and pension funds are usually the biggest holders of these bonds. An IMF spokesperson confirmed the meeting and said that a domestic debt rework is among the several issues identified as challenges to debt restructuring. The meeting will also be attended by representatives of official and private creditors, borrowing countries, debt experts as well as financial and legal advisers. A previous June technical meeting focused on cut-off dates, as consensus is needed on the starting date from which new loans are excluded from a restructuring. The roundtable was launched late last year and held meetings in February and April amid rising concerns over continued delays in securing debt treatment for countries in default that are in talks with a wide variety of stakeholders like the Paris Club, India and China - the worlds largest bilateral creditor.

        "title": "Will transform Sri Lanka into an education hub in South Asia  Suren Raghavan",
        "date": "September 8, 2023 10:22 pm",
        "content": "State Minister for Higher Education Dr. Suren Raghavan has affirmed that the initiatives to establish Sri Lanka as the hub of education in South Asia have been executed under the leadership of President Ranil Wickremesinghe. He conveyed this message during a press briefing at the Presidential Media Center today (Sept. 08), held on the theme Collective Path to a Stable Country. Expressing his views further Dr. Raghavan said; President Ranil Wickremesinghe addressed two key topics in the recent period. One of them is economic reforms, while the other pertains to educational reform. He recognizes that economic development is unattainable without a strong educational foundation. Given the competitiveness of the global economy, progress hinges on an intelligent and well-prepared workforce. Over the past four years, the number of students who have successfully passed the Advanced Level exams in Sri Lanka has increased by 63. Despite setbacks resulting from events such as the Easter bomb attack, the COVID epidemic and various challenges, higher education has made significant strides this year. However, we are currently facing a shortage of physical resources to accommodate this influx of students. According to global standards, a college should have one teacher for every fifteen students. Unfortunately, in our state universities, there is only one teacher for every thirty students. Its crucial to emphasize that the development of human resources is as essential as bolstering physical resources to ensure the quality of higher education and we are actively working towards achieving this balance. Another significant concern is that the majority of students who sit for the advanced level examination opt for the arts stream. This trend is largely due to the fact that out of the 3,000 schools offering education up to the advanced level in the country, only 2,100 provide the arts stream. Consequently, the focus of the new education reforms is on creating a system that enables students studying the arts stream to attain a bachelors degree in science. When free education was introduced in Sri Lanka, the country had a limited population, with only four hundred thousand children. However, the population of Sri Lanka has now grown to 22 million and the number of children has increased to 4.3 million. Given this development, it is imperative to focus on enhancing both physical and human resources in the new education reforms. It is estimated that Rs. 2 trillion will be required to provide the necessary laboratories, hostels, physical infrastructure and human resources for university students. The largest fund in Sri Lanka, the Provident Fund, currently stands at Rs.4 trillion, with approximately 50 earmarked for education. Consequently, the proposal includes adding campuses to existing universities as part of higher education sector reforms. Establishing two campuses in each of the 17 state universities is expected to alleviate congestion in student enrollment. Additionally, private universities should be encouraged to thrive. Currently, there are 24 private universities operating in Sri Lanka, with applications received for 20 more. To create global citizens through the university system, scholarships should be made available for students seeking admission to both private and public universities. Alternatively, a loan system can be implemented, allowing for the recovery of payments based on the chosen subject streams upon leaving the university. This approach fosters student interest in pursuing job-oriented courses. Research within the university sector has been instrumental in the development of many developed countries worldwide. However, due to the geographical distance between public universities in Sri Lanka, societal issues have not been adequately addressed through research. Hence, there is a need for greater integration between universities and society. Intellectual freedom should be promoted within agricultural colleges and internationalization should be embraced by public universities.",
