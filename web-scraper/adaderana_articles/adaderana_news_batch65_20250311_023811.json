        "title": "Sports Minister says President asked him to scrap SLC Interim Committee",
        "date": "November 7, 2023 03:57 pm",
        "content": "Sports Minister Roshan Ranasinghe says President Ranil Wickremesinghe asked him to call off the Interim Committee appointed for Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC), soon after the conclusion of the Cabinet meeting on Monday (Nov. 06). Speaking on the matter during the parliamentary session today, the lawmaker said the President had cautioned him that the Sports Law would be put under his purview unless the appointed Interim Committee is revoked. I told him to remove me from my ministerial post and to take any decision at his discretion. I said I would not under any circumstances call off the appointed Interim Committee. Ranasinghe also branded the board members of SLC as a band of thieves involved in multiple acts of misconduct. The sports minister also took issue with the Attorney General and the Inspector-General of Police (IGP) for failing to take due action despite two months having elapsed since the Auditor General Department released a special report exposing the misconduct on the part of cricket board officials. Ranasinghes comments came after the Appeals Court issued stay orders on the Interim Committee and the special gazette notification issued in this regard. A two-member judge bench delivered the order after taking into account a writ petition filed by SLC chairman Shammi Silva. The Appeals Court has given three stay orders in total pertaining to the matter: the first to prevent the gazette issued by the Sports Minister appointing the interim committee for the SLC, the second to prevent the Interim Committee members from acting in their respective positions and the third to prevent the respondents including the sports minister from interfering the activities of the petitioner and the other officials of the cricket board. By way of a special gazette notification, the sports minister on Monday (06) appointed a seven-member Interim Committee for Sri Lanka Cricket, chaired by World Cup-winning former Sri Lanka captain Arjuna Ranatunga, under the powers vested with him via the Sports Law No 25 of 1973. The previous SLC board was also suspended through this communiqué. The interim committee consists of the following members: S. I. Imam, Retired Supreme Court Judge; Rohini Marasinghe, Retired Supreme Court Judge; Irangani Perera, Retired High Court Judge; Arjuna Ranatunga (Chairman); Upali Dharmadasa; Rakitha Rajapakshe, Attorney-at-Law; and Hisham Jamaldeen. As the President had not been informed of the appointment of the said Interim Committee and its composition, the matter was taken up for discussion at the meeting of Cabinet Ministers convened on Monday evening. During the meeting, it was decided that a Cabinet sub-committee be appointed on the consent of the Sports Minister and the President, under the chairmanship of Minister Ali Sabry and consisting of Ministers Tiran Alles, Manusha Nanayakkara and Kanchana Wijesekera.",

        "date": "November 7, 2023 04:02 pm",
        "content": "The Ministry of Agriculture has decided to provide diesel worth Rs. 17,000 per farmer during this Maha cultivation season, to farmers whose cultivations were destroyed as a result of the drought situation which prevailed over the last Yala season. This subsidy is provided in addition to the concessionary payment of Rs.15,000 for the purchase of fertilizers and the compensation of Rs. 100,000 per hectare provided by the government, the Agriculture Ministry said. Meanwhile, a discussion pertaining to the subsidies to be provided for the farmers whose crops and cultivations were damaged due to weather conditions was held under the patronage of Agriculture Minister Mahinda Amaraweera yesterday (06). The Ministry of Agriculture, the Department of Agrarian Development and the officials of the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) were also present at the meeting. The Ministry of Agriculture mentioned that the Government of China had provided 6.5 million litres of diesel to be distributed to the farmers in Sri Lanka free of charge during the Maha Season and that of this there is a balance of 2 million litres, as a large number of small-scale paddy farmers had not come to obtain their quota of fuel. Therefore, the ministry decided to distribute those remaining fuel stocks to the farmers during this Maha season, the Agriculture Ministry said. Accordingly, Minister Amaraweera has instructed all relevant officials to take steps to immediately distribute this stock of fuel at the ratio of 40 litres per farmer, to all the farmers who had to face crop damages during that period. At the same time, it has been decided to prioritize the farmers of Walawe Zone, whose cultivations were damaged as a result of the Udawalawe Reservoir drying up, considering it a man-made disaster since water was not released from the Samanalawewa Reservoir on time.",

        "date": "November 7, 2023 04:17 pm",
        "content": "Minister of Labour and Foreign Employment Manusha Nanayakkara has called for an investigation to determine whether any party has leaked the information to outsiders regarding the increase in the import tax on sugar before it was even presented to the Cabinet of Ministers. The minister questioned how businessmen received information regarding the increase in the import tax on sugar before it was presented to the Cabinet, emphasizing that only Sri Lanka Customs officials were aware of the tax revision. Speaking to the media, Nanayakkara expressed that we raised our voice regarding the sugar fraud back then, and we will continue to raise our voice if there is a fraud even today. We will not keep our mouths shut where there is a fraud or a mistake. We need to find out what has happened here. The real issue here is how the information of the decision to increase tax was delivered to the businessmen. To be honest, even the Cabinet Members were not aware of the decision to increase tax, he added. As soon as the government decides to impose a tax, some businessmen import those items. When the government decides to reduce tax, this same group hides those specific items. The question we have to find the answer for is how that information reached those businessmen? I am sure that information does not leak from the Cabinet, he claimed. Furthermore, Minister Nanayakkara alleged that there is a group that always gains profit from changes in taxes. That is why the President set a maximum retail price for sugar. With that decision, it will not be possible to gain profits from this tax increase. He also said that the government has taken some unpopular decisions as they are working towards debt restructuring. If we do not restructure the debt, we will continue to be a bankrupt country. After the restructuring period of the country, investors will start to come to Sri Lanka and businesses will develop. Then, everyones income will be increased, he added. We will not allow any government institution to run at a loss. All institutions should become profit-making institutions, Nanayakkara said, adding that as of today, the interest rate has decreased. The small businessman has benefited from it. What we need to do is increase the income of the people. I can say that the situation will improve a lot by February-March next year.",

        "date": "November 7, 2023 04:43 pm",
        "content": "Tennis legend Serena Williams told a glittery fashion industry audience how fashion became a favored mode of expression as she grew up in the public eye, with the tennis court serving as her runway. I knew when I was a little girl that I was different, so I explored fashion and style as a way to distinguish myself, Williams said as she accepted the Fashion Icon award Monday night from the Council of Fashion Designers of America. In many ways for me, the tennis courts became my runway, and the U.S. Open was my own New York Fashion Week. Reimagining the traditional tennis outfit became a way, she said, to express my individuality and my confidence and most importantly, my culture.  Williams, who retired from tennis last year, is the first athlete to win the Fashion Icon award, and it was presented to her by Kim Kardashian, a CFDA honoree last year. Kardashian called Williams fearless, heroic, authentic, iconic  the greatest of all time. The fashion industrys equivalent of Oscar night was held at the American Museum of Natural History in Manhattan and hosted by Anne Hathaway. In top designer awards, Catherine Holstein of the label Khaite was named womenswear designer of the year, and Willy Chavarria won for menswear. The award for accessories went to Ashley Olsen and Mary-Kate Olsen of the label The Row. Among other honors: Gwyneth Paltrow accepted the Innovation award for goop, her 15-year old lifestyle brand, presented by Demi Moore. Vanessa Hudgens presented a tribute from the CFDA board of directors to Vera Wang, for her impact on the bridal industry. Designer Maria Cornejo won a lifetime achievement award, presented by Laura Linney. There was also a tribute to the 50th anniversary of hip-hop with a short film by director Hype Williams, introduced by Mary J. Blige and with music by Pharrell. When Williams, now 42, retired from tennis, she said she needed to make the tough choice to focus on motherhood. She gave birth in August to a baby girl, almost exactly a year after her last match as a tennis star. Adira River Ohanian is the second child  and second daughter  for Williams and her husband, Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian. Their first, Olympia, was born in 2017. In her speech, she spoke fondly about how shed learned to express her creativity on the court. I designed skirts out of denim and I wore purple tutus and bodysuits, she said, and put beads in my hair, and braids. It was really just a fun time for me. Williams studied fashion during her playing career, and in 2018, launched her S by Serena clothing line, which she said in her speech was intended to inspire women women to embrace their bodies and love who they are no matter their size, race or income. Among her many thank-yous, she saved her last for her mother, for actually making those first tennis outfits when I was young. Watching her sew, she said, created this creativity in me that I still have to this day. The CFDA awards are presented by Amazon Fashion. Other honors: Alina Cho received a media award, Domenico De Sole won the founders award, Mara Hoffman won a sustainability award, and the international award went to Jonathan Anderson for JW Anderson and Loewe.

        "title": "Meta bars political advertisers from using generative AI tools",
        "date": "November 7, 2023 05:03 pm",
        "content": "In a move that could force political parties across globe to change their social media strategy during elections, Meta is banning political advertisers from using the Facebook parent companys new generative AI products as per a Reuters report. For the unversed, Metas advertising standards prohibit ads with content that have been debunked by the companys fact-checking partners, but it does not have any rules specifically on AI. The company publicly disclosed the decision to bar certain advertisers from using its AI tools in updates posted to its help centre on Monday night. As we continue to test new Generative AI ads creation tools in Ads Manager, advertisers running campaigns that qualify as ads for Housing, Employment or Credit or Social Issues, Elections, or Politics, or related to Health, Pharmaceuticals or Financial Services arent currently permitted to use these Generative AI features, it said in a note appended to several pages explaining how the tools work. The move comes after President Joe Biden last week signed an executive order establishing AI guardrails such as requiring developers to share some information with the government and assigning agencies to create safety and security standards for AI tools and issue guidance on AI labeling and watermarking. Earlier in October, Democrat legislators Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and U.S. Rep. Yvette Clarke of New York in a letter to Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and X CEO Linda Yaccarino expressed concern about AI content in political ads and sought information regarding the platforms efforts to prevent harm to fair elections. With the 2024 elections quickly approaching, a lack of transparency about this type of content in political ads could lead to a dangerous deluge of election-related misinformation and disinformation across your platforms  where voters often turn to learn about candidates and issues, the letter said. Alphabets Google, the biggest digital advertising company, announced the launch of similar image-customising generative AI ads tools last week. It plans to keep politics out of its products by blocking a list of political keywords from being used as prompts, a Google spokesperson told Reuters. Google has also planned a mid-November policy update to require that election-related ads must include a disclosure if they contain synthetic content that inauthentically depicts real or realistic-looking people or events. TikTok and Snapchat owner Snap both bar political ads, while X, previously known as Twitter, has not rolled out any generative AI advertising tools.Metas top policy executive, Nick Clegg, said last month that the use of generative AI in political advertising was clearly an area where we need to update our rules. He warned ahead of a recent AI safety summit in the UK that governments and tech companies alike should prepare for the technology to be used to interfere in upcoming elections in 2024, calling for special focus on election-related content that moves from one platform to the other. In the last couple of years, the social networking platform along with its messaging app WhatsApp, Bytdance-owned TikTok, and ShareChat, has emerged as a go-to platform for political parties to run their views and propaganda to attract as well as manipulate voter base. --Agencies--",

        "date": "November 7, 2023 11:33 pm",
        "content": "Nepali economist and Member of Parliament Dr. Swarnim Waglé says the International Monetary Fund (IMF) gets blamed for the mess created by politicians when the government implements unpopular policies to comply with the conditions set by the global lender for the bailout package. Dr. Waglé, an eminent Nepali economist Member of Nepals Federal Parliament, made these remarks while speaking to At HydePark on Ada Derana 24. When asked about his opinions on the reason as to why the IMFs bailout package of USD 2.9 billion under the 48-month Extended Fund Facility (EFF) is unpopular among the locals, the Nepali parliamentarian said the countrys leadership must do a better job of explaining the circumstances to the members of the public. Dr. Waglé pointed out that Sri Lanka had to go to the IMF because no one else was going to come forward to help. By the time the country turned to the IMF for help, it was already in deep economic trouble, so, the IMF gets blamed for a lot of the mess that the politicians created, Dr. Waglé added. When a country is in a real mess, he said ultranationalism often gets in the way, and opined that this radical loyalty and devotion can become a detriment to the country. Speaking further, Dr. Waglé underscored the importance of Sri Lanka fulfilling its promises made to the IMF under the 48-month Extended Fund Facility (EFF) program for a USD 2.9 billion bailout package. The economist said the conditions set by the IMF are necessary. Once the country signs and seals the deal, it is imperative to follow through to give the notion that Sri Lanka is deeply considering the implementation of crisis measures to bounce back, despite having halted all the previous IMF packages mid-way. When asked about Sri Lankas progress in respect of economic recovery and whether the reforms and policies being undertaken are adequate, the Nepali economist said the island nation could do a lot more to consolidate its public finances, highlighting that tax-to-GDP ratio remains relatively low while tax exemptions are rife and tax collection is not strong enough. However, the debt restructuring process has seen some improvement, he added. Dr. Waglé also commended Sri Lankas measures to bilaterally engage with countries outside the South Asian region to gain preferential trade access, which he said would be advantageous for the island nations export products.",

Filing a petition in this regard, TISL challenged 37 clauses of the Anti-Corruption Bill in total, including clauses 28(3), 161 and 119, stating that they were disproportionate and could have a chilling effect on whistleblowing, the right to information and the freedom of expression, and could affect the concepts of transparency and accountability. Meanwhile, the Women Parliamentarians Caucus (WPC) also submitted proposals to amend the Anti-Corruption Bill. The Supreme Court had also determined that certain clauses of the Bill were inconsistent with the Constitution and therefore should be tabled after amendments. Delivering the Supreme Court determination, however, Speaker Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena stated that the said inconsistencies cease, if the amendments, as set out in the determination of the Supreme Court, are made to the Bill. The Additional Solicitor General also informed the Supreme Court that amendments to clauses 8 (3), 136, 141, 142 and 156 of the Bill, as set out in the determination, would be made in a bid to address several concerns raised by the petitioners.",

According to the Auditor Generals report, they have spent Rs. 34,600,000 as fees for lawyers alone There are children without shoes. They spend this amount of money just to cover up their fraudulent activities, he said. Furthermore, the Sports Minister, who took into note the victories and achievements obtained during his tenure, claimed that the Sri Lankan players have brought over 160 medals to the country during his tenure this year for the first time in history. Sports Minister Ranasinghe, who also commented regarding the matter that the President was not informed regarding the appointment of the Interim Committee for SLC, emphasized that if the act empowers him to make decisions regarding the matter alone, he can take over the responsibility. If the act has empowered me, if the President has appointed me to this position, if I have been appointed with the public mandate, theres no point that I should obtain the Presidents approval. The act doesnt mention something like that. I know when to obtain the Cabinet approval and permission from the President. I would like to work with no interference of anyone to my ministry, Ranasinghe said. Speaking further, Minister Ranasinghe said: I have a responsibility to protect the President, if I remain in the ruling party. There are previous allegations too. I observe that some individuals are trying to destroy the President. Dont allow the corrupt to remain close to the president. He also called for the need to investigate biased officials who remain within the Presidential Secretariat. Meanwhile, he further explained that former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa appointed him as the Sports Minister, asking him to rebuild the countrys sports and the Youth Services Council which he claims were corrupt at the time. I took over this responsibility, he added. Moreover, the minister expressed that I can vouch that former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa did not steal, but took incorrect decisions. Nevertheless, he took over all the issues which were coming from 1977 on his shoulders. When the Aragalaya protest movement escalated, he resigned due to his respect for the people. We are now ashamed to tell that were Sri Lankans in front of the international community, he added, urging to come together to expel the corruption that remains within the SLC.",

        "date": "November 8, 2023 02:50 pm",
        "content": "Adani Group plans to set up a 500-megawatt wind power project in Sri Lanka after successful completion of a 553 million debt financing from the U.S. International Development Finance Corp. for its Colombo West International Terminal. The group has proposed to the Sri Lankan government to set up the wind project in the northwestern region at an initial investment of 750 million, Karan Adani, chief executive officer of Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone Ltd., told BQ Prime at a post-event interaction in Colombo. It will take 24 months for the first phase of the project to get commissioned once the approval comes from the Sri Lankan government, Adani said. The west coast of Sri Lanka is blessed with very good wind conditions and has strong potential for the generation of wind power, according to Adani. The renewable power generated will be the cheapest power that will be sold in the country. The group is also planning to set up a cross-country transmission corridor from Sri Lanka that will connect to the Indian power grid on the lines between India and Bangladesh, he said. 553 Million Funding For Colombo Terminal Adani Group has received 553 million in funding for its Colombo West International Terminal, which it is setting up in partnership with John Keells Holdings PLC, Sri Lankas largest private sector conglomerate. This is the first time that the U.S. government, through its agency, DFC, has financed any port-related investment in Sri Lanka or any Adani-operated project, he said. Any project financed by the DFC is first approved by the US Congress, Adani said. It is an approval and reposing of faith in our groups financial and execution capabilities. The tenure of the loan will be for 20 years, with an equity contribution of 30 by the partners. We are looking at around 16 return on investments from the project, he said. Adani Ports is setting up two container terminals at the Port of Colombo, which is the largest and busiest transshipment port in the Indian Ocean. The port has been operating at more than 90 utilisation since 2021 and has required additional capacity. The new terminal will cater to growing economies in the Bay of Bengal, taking advantage of Sri Lankas prime position on major shipping routes and its proximity to these expanding markets. The first phase of the project is expected to be completed between December 2024 and February 2025, Adani said. Once completed, the terminals will add 3.2 million 20-foot equivalent container handling capacity at the Colombo Port. More Strategic Ports Adani Ports is planning to add more strategic locations to its portfolio of international ports that at present are in Israels Haifa and Sri Lanka. We are seriously looking at adding port infrastructure in Bangladesh, East Africa, Middle East, southeast Asia and Vietnam, Adani said. This has been planned keeping integration of the global supply chain in mind, especially with plan to make India as the hub for our operations. The U.S. support for the deepwater terminal through the International Development Finance Corp. underscores New Delhis and Washingtons efforts to curtail Chinas influence, as it has invested more than 2 billion in Sri Lanka to build infrastructure before the island nation faced economic meltdown. Adani said the group has also put in a proposal for a renewable business in Sri Lanka as the country is blessed with good winds on the west coast. We plan to set up 500-megawatt wind project in the first phase. The conglomerate will also set up a cross-country transmission line to connect Indian grid for power export to India, Adani said. The planned capex is 750 million and it will be the cheapest electricity for Sri Lanka, he said. Shares of Adani Ports and SEZ Ltd. were trading 2.34 higher at 11:35 a.m., close to the days high of Rs 816.4 apiece. The benchmark NSE Nifty 50 was up 0.15. Source - BQ Prime - Agencies",

        "date": "November 8, 2023 02:55 pm",
        "content": "Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) has emphasised that it remains dedicated to ensuring good governance and transparency, in response to the recent allegations levelled by the countrys Minister of Sports. Issuing a statement in this regard on Wednesday (08 Nov.), SLC deemed the said allegations false, malicious and misleading, and further highlighted that any allegations suggesting financial impropriety or mismanagement, of any sort, are baseless, and are being made with the intention of creating unnecessary concern among the public. Speaking further in this regard, SLC stated that after having been entrusted with the honour of hosting the ICC Under 19 World Cup in 2024, the institution is diligently working towards the successful execution of the tournament, and thus, as part of the responsibilities that comes with hosting such a tournament, SLC has also been entrusted with providing match venues that align with the International Cricket Councils (ICC) stringent standards. In pursuit of this goal, we have taken significant measures to improve the infrastructure at selected grounds. The funds, received as grants from the ICC and specifically designated for these enhancements, are solely dedicated to the development of facilities in preparation for the Under 19 World Cup in 2024, SLC highlighted, with regards to recent concerns surrounding the development of the Dambulla International Cricket Ground. Commenting specifically on the matter, SLC noted that the development of the Dambulla Ground was in response to long-standing requirements, aimed at enhancing the grounds facilities to meet the standards set out by the ICC. The Cricket Board asserted, however, that any statements suggesting that SLC has spent Rs. 1.5 billion on replacing floodlights alone are false and unfounded. Attached below is the full statement issued by SLC: Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) aims to correct and address the false, malicious and misleading information circulated by the Minister of Sports under the cover of parliamentary privileges on November 7th, 2023. SLC takes this opportunity to provide the public with accurate information regarding the ongoing preparations for the ICC Under 19 World Cup in 2024. Firstly, it is imperative to note that the International Cricket Council (ICC) has entrusted Sri Lanka with the honor of hosting the ICC Under 19 World Cup in 2024. This prestigious event is scheduled to commence in January 2024, and Sri Lanka Cricket is diligently working towards its successful execution. Preparations for this globally recognized tournament are well underway, with ICC representatives closely supervising the overall planning and execution. They are actively collaborating with SLC to ensure that the tournament is conducted in compliance with international standards. As part of our responsibilities, SLC is entrusted with the provision of match venues that align with the ICCs stringent standards. In pursuit of this goal, we have taken significant measures to improve the infrastructure at selected grounds. The funds, received as grants from the ICC and specifically designated for these enhancements, are solely dedicated to the development of facilities in preparation for the Under 19 World Cup in 2024. Furthermore, SLC wishes to clarify that the installation of floodlights and associated infrastructure at the Dambulla International Cricket Ground is in response to long- standing requirements. This initiative is aimed at enhancing the grounds facilities to meet ICC venue standards. The said project began to accommodate the Asia Cup 2023; however, due to import restrictions in place at the time, it could not be completed in time for that event. A public tender for this project was carried out a few months ago, and the process was closely monitored by a Ministry Representative throughout. The project was awarded in accordance with government-approved tender processes. Any statements suggesting that SLC has spent Rs. 1.5 billion on replacing floodlights alone are false and unfounded. In terms of project management, interim payments are made in accordance with the projects progress and contractual requirements. Any allegations suggesting financial impropriety or mismanagement are without merit and seem intended to create unnecessary concern among the public. Additionally, it is important to highlight that members of the Interim Committee, who were briefly in operation after their appointment, have removed vital project-related payment vouchers and documentation from SLC premises. SLC strongly disapproves of the behavior exhibited by the said members who advocated the importance of good governance and transparency and wishes to emphasize that if these materials are not returned immediately, SLC will be compelled to initiate legal action against those responsible. In conclusion, Sri Lanka Cricket remains dedicated to ensuring good governance, transparency, and the successful hosting of the ICC Under 19 World Cup in 2024. We encourage responsible reporting and the verification of facts before spreading misinformation that could potentially harm the image of cricket administration in our country.",

        "content": "Sri Lanka and Argentina remain very vulnerable amid a worsening in global financial conditions while China has suffered a sharp deterioration in financial resilience since pre-COVID times, a think-tank study found on Wednesday. The resilience indicator, published by the Washington-based Center for Global Development, assesses which countries would be most economically and financially affected if an external shock were to materialise. It is based on data published by the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and governments. China was found to be most weakened country across a sample of 37 countries, having ranked among the top 10 most resilient emerging economies in 2019 and dropping to 18th place in 2023. Emerging markets were now more vulnerable than in 2019 on an overall basis, economist Liliana Rojas-Suarez wrote in the report. The scars of the 2020-2022 shocks that started with the COVID pandemic and the subsequent multiple shocks, such as Russias war on Ukraine and the U.S. Feds increases in interest rates, are deep and have weakened emerging markets economic and financial conditions, Rojas-Suarez wrote. A severe shortage of dollars tipped Sri Lanka into its worst financial crisis since independence from Britain in 1948 last year, triggering its first foreign debt default in May 2022. Argentina is in recession for the sixth time in a decade, with triple-digit inflation and foreign net reserves in the red. The study also showed that debt sustainability has declined over the last four years across emerging market economies. In 2019, only Tunisia, Pakistan, Argentina, and Sri Lanka had ratios of external financing needs above 100. Now, 12 of the 37 countries we examined, or about one third, are in that position, Rojas-Suarez said, adding these countries have very large and unsustainable large public debt ratios. The study calculated external financing needs by measuring short-term external debt plus current account deficits as a proportion of international reserves. Bolivia, Egypt, Turkey and El Salvador are also on the list of vulnerable countries, while the study shows that Indonesia, Peru and Bulgaria are the most resilient countries in the group.

        "date": "November 8, 2023 05:32 pm",
        "content": "The Colombo Magistrates Court has issued an order directing the officials of the relevant insurance companies to suspend for a period of one week the life insurance payments to beneficiaries on behalf of the late businessman Dinesh Schaffter who died under mysterious circumstances. Colombo Additional Magistrate Rajindra Jayasuriya issued this order today (Nov. 08), after considering a request made by the Police Homicide and Organized Crimes Division to issue an order to the relevant officials of the insurance companies to suspend the payment of the insurance compensation to the concerned beneficiaries. The request has been made in order to support the investigations being carried out pertaining to the death of the prominent businessman, which was recently ruled as a crime by the court. On November 01, the Colombo Magistrates Court determined that the death of businessman Dinesh Schaffter occurred as a result of an external pressure applied on his neck and the facial area, after the five-member experts committee comprising Judicial Medical Officers appointed to uncover the actual cause of death of the late businessman Schaffter submitted its report on the post-mortems to the court. Accordingly, the magistrate who ruled that a crime had been committed through this incident, ordered the Director of the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) to arrest the relevant suspects and produce them before the courts. There, the Additional Magistrate ordered the CID to take measures to hand over the remains of the late businessman, which are currently placed at the Karapitiya Teaching Hospital, to his family members. She also ordered to provide necessary facilities for the burial of the remains at the Jawatte Cemetery, as per the previous court orders. Former Director of the Janashakthi PLC Group, Dinesh Schaffter, was found tied up in his car at the General Cemetery in Borella on 15 December 2022 and died a day later while receiving treatment at the ICU of the National Hospital in Colombo.",

Accordingly, Lanka IOC states that the company procures the highest quality of fuel from reputed suppliers across the globe through an international competitive bidding process. One such combined shipment of Gasoil and Gasoline from an international fuel supplier arrived at the Colombo Port recently, the statement said, adding that the Gasoline parcel imported has already met statutory quality requirements and has been accepted and discharged. However, the LIOC mentioned in the statement that the Gasoil parcel is still undergoing normal quality testing and has not yet been cleared for discharge. Until the time this consignment meets all statutory quality specifications, the product shall not be accepted by Lanka IOC and shall remain under the ownership of the supplier, it added. Lanka IOC, with over 02 decades of presence in Sri Lanka, has contributed to the economic growth and advancement of the energy sector of Sri Lanka. Lanka IOC has stood with the people of Sri Lanka during tough times, especially during the crisis situation last year. Furthermore, the company said it will continue to offer their services to the people of Sri Lanka by ensuring assured and timely delivery of quality products through LIOC sheds across the country and help Sri Lanka consolidate its economic recovery and stability. LIOC categorically assures Sri Lankan consumers the highest standards in all its products reaching them, the statement highlighted.

        "date": "November 8, 2023 06:11 pm",
        "content": "The report by a Committee headed by Justice K.T. Chitrasiri to introduce a new Constitution to Sri Lanka Cricket through a parliamentary act was formally handed over to the Chairman of the Cabinet Sub-Committee appointed to resolve Sri Lanka Cricket issues, Minister of Foreign Affairs Ali Sabry by Presidents Secretary Saman Ekanayake today (09) on the instructions of President Ranil Wickremesinghe. President Ranil Wickremesinghes stance is that the current crisis in Sri Lankas most popular sport, cricket, is intricate and profound. He maintains that merely appointing an interim committee will not suffice to address the issue adequately. In his view, to advance the sport and find a lasting solution, a permanent and substantive approach is necessary. The Chitrasiri Committee Report, which was prepared accordingly, had been presented to the President the previous month. Originally, the plan was to submit it to Parliament after the conclusion of the 2023 Cricket World Cup and the presentation of the 2024 budget. However, in light of the current circumstances, President Ranil Wickremesinghe has decided to expedite the process by submitting the proposed new draft constitution to the Cabinet sub-committee and subsequently bringing it to the attention of Parliament. Accordingly, it will be tabled and discussed by the ruling party in the debate held in Parliament tomorrow (09). This new draft constitution suggests a comprehensive overhaul of the method for appointing members to the Sri Lanka Cricket Board, as well as changes in its composition, administration and management. According to the proposed constitution, the Sri Lanka Cricket Board will be governed by a Board of Directors comprised of 18 members, each appointed for a 4-year term. These directors will be entrusted with the authority to make policy decisions and the power to execute these decisions will be vested in a Director-General appointed by the Board of Directors. Out of these 18 directors, 8 will be appointed directors and the responsibility for recommending them will rest with an expert committee consisting of 6 members. This committee will include the Chairman of the National Sports Council, the President of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka or a nominee from that institute, the President of the Bar Association of Sri Lanka or a nominee from that association, the Chairperson of the Chamber of Commerce of Sri Lanka or a nominee from that chamber, the Chairperson of the Institute of Directors of Sri Lanka and the Chairperson of the Chartered Institute of Management Accountants Sri Lanka (CIMA Sri Lanka) or a nominee from that institute. The remaining 10 board members will be chosen through an official election process. This election will select 5 directors to represent cricket clubs, 1 for the Players Association, 1 for the School Cricket Association, 1 for the Womens Cricket Association, 1 for the Umpires Association, and 1 for the Coaches Association. Additionally, a proposal has been made to establish 12 committees dedicated to various aspects of cricket, each with a formal mandate. These committees include the Cricket Committee, Audit Committee, Related Party Transactions Committee, Nominations Committee, Selection Committee, Tournament Committee, Facilities Development Committee, Rules, Arbitration and Disciplinary Committee, Investment Committee, Anti-Doping and Anti-Corruption Committee and Remuneration Committee. --PMD--",

        "content": "The Bangladesh High Court today (Nov 08) issued a ruling asking why necessary actions shall not be taken to withdraw the name of former Pakistani cricketer Waqar Younis from the list of international commentators of the International Cricket Council (ICC) for slandering Shakib-al Hasan during a World Cup match. A High Court bench comprising Justice Mostafa Zaman Islam and Justice Md Atabullah passed the order asking the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) and the BCB President to respond to the rule within 10 days. During a World Cup match between Sri Lanka and Bangladesh on November 06, Younis made harsh remarks on Bangladesh Cricket Team Captain Shakib-al Hasan regarding the controversial timed-out decision given by the umpire to Sri Lankan player Angelo Matthews. The court passed the rule as Supreme Court lawyer ABM Waliur Rahman made an application in this regard. In the writ, Younis was criticized for making derogatory comments about Bangladesh cricket and Shakib Al Hasan. During the 38th match of this years World Cup, Shakib Al Hasan decided to appeal for a timed-out dismissal of former Sri Lankan captain Angelo Mathews at the Arun Jaitley Stadium in Delhi. While there is a timed-out rule in the ICC regulations, it has not been implemented previously. Younis, along with Sri Lankas former cricketer Russel Arnold, criticized Shakibs actions in the commentary box, describing the appeal as unsportsmanlike behaviour. Younis specifically targeted Shakib, questioning his actions and criticizing Bangladeshs approach, adding that it was against the spirit of cricket. -Agencies",

        "content": "State Minister for Social Empowerment Anupa Pasqual announced that, under the guidance of President Ranil Wickremesinghe, they are actively crafting a fresh legislation dedicated to improving the rights and well-being of differently abled individuals. In his statement, the state minister emphasized the governments commitment to ensuring that differently abled citizens are no longer considered a dependent population and that they should be treated as equal citizens, not relegated to second-class status, the Presidents Media Division (PMD) said. State Minister Anupa Pasqual made these remarks during a press conference conducted at the Presidential Media Centre today (08), centered around the theme of Collective Path to a Stable Country. Expressing his views further State Minister Pasqual said; We have been entrusted with a significant mission aimed at empowering our society in the upcoming year. One of the most notable tasks assigned to our ministry is the empowerment of 1 million beneficiaries from underprivileged backgrounds. It is crucial to highlight that the 1.6 million differently abled community members have not received the empowerment they deserve thus far. Under the dedicated guidance of President Ranil Wickremesinghe, we are committed to completing these initiatives in the coming year. To kick-start the International Day of the Disabled, observed on the 1st of December, we have organized special activities aimed at promoting the development of the differently abled individuals, just like any other segment of our society. Our initiative, named Empo 2023, involves differently abled individuals from across the island traveling by train from Colombo to Kandy, with a visit to the Dalada Maligawa and a special ceremony planned at the Peradeniya Botanical Garden. Whats truly remarkable is that the event will bring together differently abled communities from around the world, including China and Japan. Additionally, at the recommendation of the President, we are actively working on a new bill designed to better the lives of differently abled people. Although discussions on this matter have been on-going since 2004, concrete progress has been elusive. We are now committed to drafting and presenting the bill to Parliament within the first quarter of the next year. Furthermore, we have organized a special conference on International Disability Day, set for December 1st, under the leadership of Justice Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe. Furthermore, it is a fundamental aspect of our governments policy to ensure that the differently abled community is no longer considered a group dependent on others. To achieve this, we are actively working to enable their participation in the development and education sectors. The differently abled community should be treated as equals, with the same rights, technological resources and accessibility as the rest of our population. As we embark on the journey into January, our ministrys primary empowerment goal revolves around productivity. We are keen on exploring how our community can contribute to the overall Gross Domestic Product. Our objective is to establish a micro-level production network involving 1 million participants. In addition, we have included proposals in this years budget. These proposals entail making the empowerment process mandatory, implementing a pension system and incorporating disability studies into university syllabi.",

If the said purported allegations are proved to be true, it would undermine the integrity of the judicial system, and if the said allegations are found to be baseless, the same would undermine the independence of the judiciary and the integrity of the justice system in our country. Any allegation made against the judiciary is found to be untrue, the same would attract penal sanctions including Contempt of Court. The BASL strongly called on the stakeholders to act within the provisions laid down in the Constitution and to protect the independence of the judiciary at any cost. Commenting further on the matter, the BASL said the independence of the judiciary is a fundamental principle of the rule of law, noting that any form of undue interference with judicial independence is extremely serious and would erode public confidence in the judiciary. The association further emphasized that statements being made in respect of ongoing court cases and reference to judges, purportedly taking cover on parliamentary privileges, are seen as a direct threat to the independence of the judiciary. The legal fraternity has continuously raised serious concerns regarding this matter. The BASL also reminded the relevant Members of Parliament that the right to represent a client is a professional right that has been safeguarded by law, and any threat to the right, is an attack on the profession at large.",

        "title": "Hollywood actors reach tentative deal with studios to end strike",
        "date": "November 9, 2023 11:35 am",
        "content": "Hollywood actors reached a tentative agreement with major studios on Wednesday to resolve the second of two strikes that rocked the entertainment industry this year as workers demanded higher pay in the streaming TV era. The 118-day work stoppage will end officially just after midnight, the SAG-AFTRA union said in a statement after its negotiating committee voted unanimously to support the deal. Valued at more than 1 billion, the new three-year contract includes increases in minimum salaries and a new streaming participation bonus, the union said. The deal also provides protections against unauthorized use of images generated by artificial intelligence (AI), an area that had emerged as a major concern from performers who feared being replaced by digital doubles. We have arrived at a contract that will enable SAG-AFTRA members from every category to build sustainable careers, the union said. SAG-AFTRA President and The Nanny star Fran Drescher wrote on Instagram: We did it!!!! The Billion  Deal! The groups national board will consider the agreement on Friday, and the union said it would release further details after that meeting. The Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP), which negotiated on behalf of Walt Disney, Netflix and other media companies, said Wednesdays agreement represented a new paradigm that gave the union its biggest contract-on-contract gains in its history. The organization said it looks forward to the industry resuming the work of telling great stories. With the strike ending, Hollywood can ramp up to full production for the first time since May. Im relieved, actor Fanny Grande said in an interview. Its been really difficult for most people in the industry, especially people of color. As it is, we dont have as many opportunities. We arent big celebrities that have money in the bank for months. Actor Jessica Payne said she felt deeply grateful, cautiously optimistic and ready to work. Word of a potential agreement had spread across Hollywood earlier on Wednesday, raising hopes among actors who had spent weeks picketing outside studio offices in New York and Los Angeles instead of on sets. Preliminary chatter was that a vote was imminent, said Rati Gupta, best known as Anu in the CBS comedy The Big Bang Theory. Hearts have been pounding for several hours today. Actors had similar concerns to film and television writers, who argued that compensation for working-class cast members had dwindled as streaming took hold, making it hard to earn a living wage in Los Angeles and New York. TV series on streaming have not offered the same residual payments that actors enjoyed during the heyday of broadcast TV. Performers also became alarmed by recent advances in artificial intelligence, which they feared could lead to studios manipulating their likenesses without permission or replacing human actors with digital images. George Clooney and other A-list stars voiced solidarity with lower-level actors and had urged union leadership to reach a resolution. Many film and TV sets shut down when the Writers Guild of America (WGA) called a strike in the spring. While WGA members returned to writing scripts in late September, the ongoing SAG-AFTRA work stoppage left many productions dark. The disruptions cost California more than 6 billion in lost output, according to a Milken Institute estimate. With little work available, many prop masters, costume designers and other crew members struggled to make ends meet. FilmLA, the group that approves filming permits, reported scripted production during the week of Oct. 29 had fallen 77 from the same time a year earlier. The Hollywood strikes came during a year of other high-profile job actions. The United Auto Workers recently ended six weeks of walkouts at Detroit carmakers. Teachers, nurses and healthcare workers also walked off the job. Hollywoods work stoppages forced broadcast networks to fill their fall lineups with re-runs, games shows and reality shows. It also led movie studios to delay big releases such as Dune: Part 2 because striking actors could not promote them. Other major films, including the latest installment of the Mission: Impossible franchise and Disneys live-action remake of animated classic Snow White, were postponed until 2025.

        "date": "November 9, 2023 12:02 pm",
        "content": "A final decision relating to the recent war of words and claims of alleged assaults involving State Minister Diana Gamage and SJB MPs Sujith Sanjaya Perera and Rohana Bandara in parliamentary premises will be given today (09). This remark was made by Deputy Speaker Ajith Rajapakse, the chairman of the committee appointed by Speaker of Parliament Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena to look into the matter. The committee consists of MPs Chamal Rajapaksa, Dr. Ramesh Pathirana, Gayantha Karunatilleka and Imthiaz Bakeer Markar. On October 20, during the parliamentary session, Gamage accused Samagi Jana Balawegayas MP Sujith Sanjaya Perera of assaulting her outside the Chamber and called for a comprehensive investigation into the matter. This prompted the temporary adjournment of the session by Deputy Speaker Ajith Rajapakse, at the request of PM Dinesh Gunawardena. After the session resumed, Chief Opposition Whip SJB MP Lakshman Kiriella said the opposition MPs had met up with Speaker Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena and showed him video footage of Diana Gamage using foul language at an opposition MP and behaving in an unruly manner. Defending his actions, MP Sujith Perera has said that he had witnessed Diana Gamage becoming embroiled in a heated argument with his fellow MP Rohana Bandara, and when asked to give it a rest, the state minister had attacked him. The SJB parliamentarian said he only acted in self-defence. MP Perera also urged the Deputy Speaker to conduct an impartial investigation into the matter. Meanwhile, MP Rohana Bandara has accused the State Minister of following him and verbally attacking him near the elevator. Following the conclusion of the parliamentary session, the three parliamentarians were once again involved in an intense war of words, which was captured by MP Perera on his mobile phone. In the aftermath of the aforesaid unruly events unfolded in Parliament, the Cabinet of Ministers on Oct. 23 gave the nod to establish an independent body to oversee the conduct of lawmakers. Prime Minister Dinesh Gunawardena and Minister of Justice, Prison Affairs and Constitutional Reforms Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe had tabled a joint proposal in this regard.",

        "date": "November 9, 2023 12:26 pm",
        "content": "Popular live video chat website Omegle is shutting down after 14 years following user claims of abuse. The service, which allowed users to socialise with random strangers online, grew in popularity with children and young people during the pandemic. Omegles closure announcement included an image of its logo on a gravestone. Founder Leif K Brooks said in a statement that operating the website was no longer sustainable, financially nor psychologically. The decision comes as social media platforms are facing increased scrutiny from regulators around the world. Just this week, Ofcom issued its first guidance for tech platforms complying with the UK Online Safety Act and the communications regulator singled out online grooming. Omegle has been the subject of controversy, including in a landmark case where a young American accused the platform of randomly pairing her with a paedophile. The account user was a minor when the incident took place and the lawsuit against Omegle was filed 10 years later in November 2021. Omegles legal team argued in court that the website was not to blame for what happened, and denied that it was a haven for predators. On Thursday, Mr Brooks said There can be no honest accounting of Omegle without acknowledging that some people misused it, including to commit unspeakably heinous crimes. However, he also pointed, without giving specific details, to the constant barrage of attacks on communication services like Omegle by a malicious subset of users. As much as I wish circumstances were different, the stress and expense of this fight - coupled with the existing stress and expense of operating Omegle, and fighting its misuse - are simply too much, Mr Brooks said. Frankly, I dont want to have a heart attack in my 30s, he added. The announcement also drew comments from users on social media who shared their favourite memories of Omegle. Their reactions ranged from surprise to nostalgia. The BBC found that Omegle has been mentioned in more than 50 cases against paedophiles in countries including the UK, US and Australia. Video-sharing platform TikTok banned sharing links to Omegle, after a BBC investigation in 2021 found what appeared to be children exposing themselves to strangers on the website. Imagery of young children carrying out sexual acts on camera has risen by more than tenfold since the pandemic lockdowns, according to the Internet Watch Foundation (IWF). In 2022, the IWF logged more than 63,000 webpages showing the material compared to 5,000 before the pandemic. Source: BBC -Agencies",

        "date": "November 9, 2023 02:00 pm",
        "content": "Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) has hit back at Sports Minister Roshan Ranasinghes recent allegations regarding the purported fund transfer of USD 2 million from its account, vehemently denying any such attempts. Issuing a statement in this regard on Thursday (09 Nov.), the cricket board categorically denied any attempt to transfer funds from its accounts to third party accounts. Highlighting that any such fund transfers are solely for operational purposes and are not indicative of any attempt to transfer funds out of SLCs accounts, the governing body emphasised that any claims accusing the cricket board of attempting to transfer funds out of its accounts are false and factually incorrect. Meanwhile, SLC also revealed that measures have been taken to release a schedule to the Parliament and to the Ministry of Sports pertaining to pending payments, for which cheques have been issued to suppliers, stakeholders, and third parties who have provided services to SLC. The schedule covers the period from 17th August 2023 to 8th November 2023 and ensures that the necessary funds are available in our LKR account to fulfill these payments upon presentation to the bank, the statement read in this regard. Earlier today, Sports Minister Roshan Ranasinghe accused a group of senior officials of Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) of attempting to withdraw USD 2 million from a state bank account, hinting at a bid to flee the country. Speaking during the ongoing Parliamentary debate regarding the removal of SLCs Office Bearers, Minister Ranasinghe revealed that he had received information that a group of SLC officials are currently attempting to obtain USD 2 million from the account of a state bank branch located near the Independence Square in Colombo. The SLC said the Sports Ministers assertions have been made with ulterior motives, aiming to create unnecessary public unrest against the cricket board. Attached below is the full statement issued by SLC, in response to the aforementioned allegations: The Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) would like to issue a statement clarifying recent assertions made by the Minister of Sports in Parliament regarding the transfer of USD 2 million from its accounts. SLC categorically denies any attempt to transfer funds from its accounts to third-party accounts and wishes to address the matter to provide clarity to the public. As the governing entity for cricket in Sri Lanka, SLC receives funds and sponsorship income in USD, which are intentionally kept in our USD accounts to leverage exchange rate fluctuations. However, it is important to note that SLC needs to carry out its operations in Sri Lanka and fulfill financial obligations to stakeholders, including suppliers, on a regular basis. To meet these expenses, SLC follows the practice of transferring funds from its USD account to its local currency (LKR) accounts. This has been a longstanding practice, as SLC does not derive significant income in local currency. It is crucial to highlight that these transfers are solely for operational purposes and are not indicative of any attempt to transfer funds out of SLCs accounts. Thus, any claims stating that SLC is trying to transfer funds out of its accounts are false and factually incorrect. It is evident that such assertions have been made with ulterior motives, aiming to create unnecessary public unrest against SLC. Additionally, we wish to state that SLC operates in accordance with the provisions of its constitution, which prohibits cash payments exceeding Rs. 10,000-. Accordingly, and to clarify the misconceptions, we have taken steps to release a schedule to the Parliament and to the Ministry of pending payments, for which cheques have been issued to suppliers, stakeholders, and third parties who have provided services to SLC. The schedule covers the period from 17th August 2023 to 8th November 2023 and ensures that the necessary funds are available in our LKR account to fulfill these payments upon presentation to the bank. SLC remains committed to transparency and upholding the integrity of its operations. We urge the public to disregard any misinformation and rely on authentic sources for accurate information. SLC will continue working diligently to support cricket development in Sri Lanka and maintain good governance.",

He pointed out the growing threat posed by illegal drugs to communities in GCC nations, and lauded several national campaigns rolled out in the region to tackle the problem.

        "date": "November 9, 2023 04:16 pm",
        "content": "Sri Lanka President Ranil Wickremesinghe will seek to boost tax revenue and rationalise spending in the governments second full-year budget on Monday, targeting a return to growth for the crisis-hit economy while keeping an eye on elections. Sri Lanka tipped into the worst financial crisis in over seven decades last year with the battered economy shrinking 7.8 in 2022, forcing it to default on its foreign debt. However, this year the islands economy has gradually stabilised, helped by a 2.9 billion bailout from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in March, prompting the World Bank to raise its growth forecast to 1.7 in 2024 from an earlier projection of 1. Sri Lankas central bank expects growth of 3.3 in 2024 after an economic contraction of 2 this year. But Wickremesinghe, who is also the countrys finance minister, will have to contend with the dual challenges of raising revenue, essential to taking forward the four-year IMF program, while also maintaining public goodwill as he prepares to face presidential elections next year. The approval rating of the government fell to 9 in October 2023 from 21 in June, according to a poll by Colombo-based think tank Verité Research, partly due to multiple rounds of fuel, water and power tariff hikes needed to put public finances on track under the IMF program. Wickremesinghe will present the budget on Monday at 12 noon (IST). In an ideal world it would be a tighter budget but realistically this budget can go either way since its coming from a political climate, said Raynal Wickremeratne co-head of research at Softlogic Stockbrokers. When it comes to more market impact we are unlikely to see income or corporate tax increases. But consumption oriented tax increases that could hit growth is what we would keep an eye on. Sri Lanka is already grappling with a delay to its second IMF tranche, with the lender calling for a strong budget with a projected 2024 deficit of about 12 amidst an estimate for a 15 shortfall for 2023. For the first time ever Sri Lankas budget expenditure will exceed 6.5 trillion rupees (19.8 billion) in 2024, an increase of 12 when compared with the previous year, according to the Appropriation Bill, a precursor for the budget. Interest payments of 2.6 trillion rupees make up more than a third of total spending, while capital expenditure will stay largely unchanged from 2023 at 1.2 trillion rupees. Bondholders and bilateral creditors will also be watching the budget for signals on how closely Sri Lanka will adhere to IMF targets, which include reaching a primary surplus of 2.3 by 2025 and reducing debt to GDP to 95 by 2032.

        "date": "November 9, 2023 04:53 pm",
        "content": "Transgender people can be godparents at Roman Catholic baptisms, witnesses at religious weddings and receive baptism themselves, the Vaticans doctrinal office said on Wednesday, responding to questions from a bishop. The department, known as the Dicastery of the Doctrine of the Faith, was vague however, in response to a question of whether a same-sex couple could have a Church baptism for an adopted child or one obtained through a surrogate mother. Bishop Jose Negri of Santo Amaro in Brazil sent the doctrinal office six questions in July regarding LGBT people and their participation in the sacraments of baptism and matrimony. The three pages of questions and answers were signed by the departments head, Argentine Cardinal Víctor Manuel Fernández, and approved by Pope Francis on Oct. 31. They were posted on the departments website on Wednesday using the Italian word for transsexuals. Francis, 86, has tried to make the Church more welcoming to the LGBT community without changing Church teachings, including one saying that same-sex attraction is not sinful but same-sex acts are. In response to a question of whether transgender people can be baptized, the doctrinal office said they could with some conditions and as long as there is no risk of causing a public scandal or disorientation among the faithful. It said transgender people could be godparents at a baptism at the discretion of the local priest as well as a witness at a Church wedding, but the local priest should exercise pastoral prudence in his decision. This is an important step forward in the Church seeing transgender people not only as people (in a Church where some say they dont really exist) but as Catholics, Father James Martin, a prominent Jesuit priest and supporter of LGBT rights in the Church, said on X, formerly known as Twitter. Francis has met with transgender people and in July, he told a transgender person: Even if we are sinners, he (God) draws near to help us. The Lord loves us as we are, this is Gods crazy love. The document said a person in a same-sex relationship could also be a witness at a Catholic wedding, the office said, citing current Church canonical legislation which contained no prohibition against it. The response was less clear regarding persons in same-sex relationships and their role in baptism, which is the initiation into the Church for infants, children or adults. The Brazilian bishop sought guidance on whether a same-sex couple who had adopted a child or obtained it from a surrogate mother could have that child baptized in a Catholic ceremony. The response said that for the child of a same-sex couple to be baptized, there had to be a well-founded hope that it would be educated in the Catholic religion. There was a similarly nuanced response to a question whether a person in a same-sex relationship could be a godparent at a Church baptism. It said the person had to lead a life that conforms to the faith. Source  Reuters --Agencies",

        "content": "Deshamanya Lalith Kotelawala  the former chairman of Ceylinco Consolidated and the founding chairman of Seylan Bank who died last month  was confined to his house by a group of lawyers prior to his passing, the Supreme Court heard today (Nov. 09). This was communicated to the Supreme Court bench by the president of Golden Key Depositors Association, Marco Perera. A motion put forward in respect of a fundamental rights (FR) petition filed by the Golden Key depositors was taken up for hearing before Justices S. Thurairajah, Achala Vengappuli and Priyantha Fernando. Perera told the judge bench that he had received reports of a group of lawyers keeping Mr. Kotelawala confined to his place prior to his death and sought an opportunity to present more submissions in this regard. However, the judge bench ordered him to file a motion to obtain permission in advance to present submissions before the Supreme Court, as he had failed to do so today. Subsequently, the next hearing of the FR petition was fixed for May 08, 2024. Renowned Sri Lankan businessman Lalith Kotelawala passed away on October 21 at the age of 84. It was reported that he had been receiving treatment at a private hospital in Colombo at the time of his demise. Golden Key Credit Card Company was once a leading financial institution specializing in credit card services and a subsidiary of Ceylinco Consolidated. In 2008, it was revealed that the outfit was involved in a lengthy embezzlement scheme since 1999 in which the depositors were scammed out of billions of rupees.",

        "content": "The Expert Study Committee appointed to recommend a new Sports Act in Sri Lanka has submitted its report to President Ranil Wickremesinghe, the Presidents Media Division said. The Committee, chaired by Mr. Jagath Fernando, has made a number of recommendations to comprehensively change the existing legal framework and administrative structure for sports in Sri Lanka. President Ranil Wickremesinghe is planning to submit the report of the Expert Study Committee on the Introduction of a New Sports Act in Sri Lanka to the Parliament and prepare a formal draft based on it, the PMD statement said. One of the primary recommendations of the Committee is to establish a National Sports Development Authority (NSDA) to regulate and supervise all sports development activities in the country. The NSDA would be responsible for formulating policies and strategies for sports development, and would have full supervision over National Sports Associations, it said. The study committee report has also suggested that the National Sports Development Authority (NSDA) should be implemented to achieve eight basic objectives The Committee has further recommended that the NSDA should consist of 11 members, including the Secretary of the Ministry of Sports and the Chairman of the National Olympic Committee (NOC) ex officio, three outstanding professionals in different fields, two former captains of national sports teams or persons who have rendered exceptional service to sports in the country and It has also been proposed to consist of a former president of a registered National Sports Association (NSA) which is not under the National Olympic Committee, as well as three representatives nominated by the Secretaries of the three Ministries of Finance, Education and Health. The Expert Study Committee on the Introduction of a New Sports Act in Sri Lanka has proposed that the National Sports Development Authority (NSDA) should have a term of office of four years. The Minister of Sports would be responsible for nominating members to the NSDA, and these nominations would need to be approved by the Constitutional Council. The expert study committee report has also suggested that the Constitutional Council should appoint a suitable person from among these members as the chairman of the authority, the PMD said. Furthermore, to ensure minimum interference in the running of National Sports Associations in order to comply with the requirements of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and other International Sports Federations, the Sports Grievance Resolution Tribunal (SGRT) comprising 10 judges with powers to resolve complaints and disputes in the field of sports was also proposed to set up. It has also been made mandatory that a complaint presented to it should be resolved by a panel of at least three judges. This study committee is confident that by implementing the above mentioned recommendations, it will be possible to bring significant amendments to the existing legal framework and administrative structure of the current Sports Act and to make these changes by amending the existing Sports Act No. 25 of 1973 of the National Assembly or abolishing that law. This study committee report has further indicated that it can be done by making new laws and a new bill can be prepared with legal support and advice, the PMD reported.",

        "date": "November 9, 2023 08:59 pm",
        "content": "An undersea volcano erupted off Japan three weeks ago, providing a rare view of the birth of a tiny new island, but experts say it may not last very long. The unnamed undersea volcano, located about 1 kilometer (half a mile) off the southern coast of Iwo Jima, which Japan calls Ioto, started its latest series of eruptions on Oct. 21. Within 10 days, volcanic ash and rocks piled up on the shallow seabed, its tip rising above the sea surface. By early November, it became a new island about 100 meters (328 feet) in diameter and as high as 20 meters (66 feet) above the sea, according to Yuji Usui, an analyst in the Japan Meteorological Agencys volcanic division. Volcanic activity has increased near Iwo Jima and similar undersea eruptions have occurred in recent years, but the formation of a new island is a significant development, Usui said. Volcanic activity at the site has since subsided, and the newly formed island has somewhat shrunk because its crumbly formation is easily washed away by waves, Usui said. He said experts are still analyzing the development, including details of the deposits. The new island could survive longer if it is made of lava or something more durable than volcanic rocks such as pumice. We just have to see the development, he said. But the island may not last very long. Undersea volcanos and seismic activities have formed new islands in the past. In 2013, an eruption at Nishinoshima in the Pacific Ocean south of Tokyo led to the formation of a new island, which kept growing during a decade-long eruption of the volcano. Also in 2013, a small island surfaced from the seabed after a massive 7.7-magnitude earthquake in Pakistan. In 2015, a new island was formed as a result of a month-long eruption of a submarine volcano off the coast of Tonga. Of about 1,500 active volcanos in the world, 111 are in Japan, which sits on the so-called Pacific ring of fire, according to the Japan Meteorological Agency. Iwo Jima was the site of some of the fiercest fighting of World War II, and the photograph taken by AP photographer Joe Rosenthal of the flag-raising atop the islands Mount Suribachi on Feb. 23, 1945, came to symbolize the Pacific War and the valor of the United States Marines.

        "date": "November 9, 2023 11:42 pm",
        "content": "The Executive Board has approved a proposal to be considered by the Board of Governors to conclude the 16th General Review of Quotas with a significant increase in quotas. The proposal follows the guidance from the International Monetary and Financial Committee (IMFC) at the 2023 Annual Meetings. Concluding the 16th Review with a quota increase will help preserve a strong, quota-based and adequately resourced IMF at the center of the Global Financial Safety Net. An adequately resourced IMF is essential to safeguard global financial stability and respond to members potential needs in an uncertain and shock-prone world, IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said after the Executive Boards decision. The proposal is centered around an increase in quotas of 50 percent, allocated to members in proportion to their current quotas. The quota increase would enhance the IMFs permanent resources and strengthen the quota-based nature of the Fund by reducing the reliance on borrowing and thus ensuring the primary role of quotas in Fund resources. The proposal envisages that once quota increases are in effect, borrowed resources comprising the Bilateral Borrowing Agreements and New Arrangements to Borrow (NAB) would be reduced to maintain the Funds current lending capacity. The membership has also acknowledged the urgency and importance of quota share realignment to better reflect members relative positions in the world economy while protecting the quota shares of the poorest members, and many members would have supported a quota realignment now, together with the proposed quota increase. Hence, another critical element of todays proposal is a call on the Executive Board to work to develop, by June 2025, possible approaches as a guide for further quota realignment, including through a new quota formula, under the 17th General Review of Quotas. Work to implement this guidance will begin as soon as feasible after the conclusion of the 16th Review. The proposed quota increase comes at a complex time for the global economy and the IMFs membership. In the spirit of international cooperation, I am hopeful this proposal will garner the broadest possible support from the membership, and that we will then make progress on a quota realignment under the 17th Review, said IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva. As the world grapples with rising fragmentation, todays decision is a strong signal that the membership can still come together in support of cooperative solutions that instill confidence in the IMFs ability to effectively support its membership navigate a challenging global landscape, she said. The Executive Board has requested that the Board of Governors vote on this proposal by December 15, 2023. Approval by the Board of Governors requires an 85 percent majority of the total voting power. --IMF",

Chitrasiri. His remarks came during a meeting held with the ruling party MPs at the parliamentary complex on Thursday. Speaking further, the Head of State reiterated that he remains impartial in this matter, adding that he is on the side of cricket. The President is of the view that appointing interim committees is a band-aid solution and will not suffice to address the issue adequately. The Chitrasiri Committee Report on the new SLC constitution was handed over yesterday to the Minister Ali Sabry-led Cabinet sub-committee appointed by the Sports Minister to look into the issue. This new draft constitution suggests a comprehensive overhaul of the method for appointing members to the SLC board, as well as changes in its composition, administration and management. According to the proposed constitution, the SLCs board would be governed by a Board of Directors comprised of 18 members, each appointed for a 4-year term. These directors will be entrusted with the authority to make policy decisions and the power to execute these decisions will be vested in a Director-General appointed by the Board of Directors.",

Meanwhile, it was reported that security had been beefed up in the area. Sri Lanka saw a series of woes throughout the tournament, with a fragile top order, only two batsmen averaging over 35, a string of injuries and having dropped more catches than perhaps any other team.

        "date": "November 10, 2023 10:14 am",
        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe has called for a comprehensive program to revive the countrys spice industry, which was once a major source of income. Speaking at the 19th Annual General Meeting of the Spice Council, the Head of State urged that a proper plan be prepared for the revival of the industry and said that the government is ready to provide the necessary support, according to the Presidents Media Division (PMD). The President stressed the importance of bringing the private sector together to implement the program promptly. Expressing his views further, President Ranil Wickremesinghe said; Sri Lanka once had the worlds best spices, but our neglect of the industry in the past 30-40 years has led to a decline in our income from spices. This needs to change. As we implement economic reforms and debt sustainability measures, we must become a more competitive and export-oriented economy. We need to earn more foreign exchange to repay our debt and ensure a positive balance of payments. One way to achieve this is to focus on an export economy that is competitive and generates foreign exchange through economic activities. Spices can be one of the main sectors of this economy. In the past, the Sri Lankan economy was heavily dependent on the spice sector. We need to expand our focus to a broader market. The government has already taken some steps in this direction, such as establishing a separate department for cinnamon development. Other spices that have been cultivated in Sri Lanka since ancient times include pepper and many others. We need to work through a targeted program to improve the production and export of these spices. Sri Lanka is known for its high-quality coffee and cocoa, in addition to spices. The government is prepared to provide the land and resources needed to develop these sectors, and there is also private land available. Let us all work together to achieve this. We should also immediately implement an agricultural modernization program that incorporates new technologies. This will help us to improve productivity and efficiency and to compete more effectively in the global market. The private sector has a vital role to play in this endeavour. I therefore urge the Spice Council to develop a plan for promoting the spice industry and I assure you that the Minister and I are ready to provide the necessary support.",

I think it would be fair to use that word, Silverwood told reporters. I think weve played some good cricket along the way, and I think well look back on certain games and rue missed opportunities, to be honest. There have been certain games during this campaign that if wed have taken the opportunities that were put our way, this could have looked a lot different.

        "content": "Trade, Commerce and Food Security Minister Nalin Fernando says food inflation is expected to decline further in 2024. Fernando mentioned that he had called for reports on food production to assess how much food prices can be controlled next year. The lawmaker made these remarks at a news conference at the Presidential Media Centre yesterday (Nov. 09), themed Collective Path to a Stable Country. Minister Nalin Fernando further commented; Food prices and safety are top priorities for our government. We have taken several steps to strengthen the economy and collect the required amount of taxes, such as increasing the sugar tax from 25 cents to Rs. 50. To protect consumers, we have also introduced a control price of Rs. 275 for 1kg of sugar. We are monitoring the sugar stocks of 12 of the 14 sugar importers daily to ensure that there is no shortage. We have also alerted officials to raid traders who sell sugar above the control price. We are also working to understand food production and security in the country, and how to control prices in the year 2024. We have requested reports from the Ministry of Fisheries, Agriculture and Livestock. This information will help us to guarantee the availability of essential goods at affordable prices for consumers next year. It will also help us to understand our import needs. We believe that by successfully implementing these measures, we can further reduce food inflation in the coming year. Sri Lanka is importing about 30 million eggs per month to help meet domestic demand and ensure that there is no shortage of eggs during the festive season. The government plans to continue egg imports until December 31, 2023, or until local production has recovered. The price of chicken meat has also been reduced from Rs. 1,700 per kilogram to Rs. 1,150 per kilogram after the government negotiated with producers. The government is committed to maintaining this lower price until the end of the year and has informed producers that it is ready to import chicken meat if necessary.",

        "date": "November 10, 2023 12:17 pm",
        "content": "The World Banks Board of Executive Directors on Thursday (Nov. 09) approved 150 million in financing for Sri Lanka to strengthen the resilience of the financial sector. Sri Lankas economic crisis highlights the need for strong safety nets to support the financial sector. Stable and reliable banking sector is essential for the economy, businesses and individuals, small businesses and poor households, said Faris Hadad-Zervos, World Bank Country Director for Maldives, Nepal, and Sri Lanka. Strengthening the Deposit Insurance Scheme will help protect the savings of smaller depositors, including women and people living in rural areas. It will also sustain the confidence in Sri Lankas financial system, a critical part of building the country back better, Hadad-Zervos added. The Financial Sector Safety Net Project is designed to boost the financial and institutional capacity of the Sri Lanka Deposit Insurance Scheme (SLDIS), which is managed by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka. The financing will help boost reserves of SLDIS which could be used towards the payout to insured depositors of banks and licensed finance companies. In parallel, the project will support institutional strengthening of the SLDIS in line with international good practices for effective deposit insurance schemes. Strengthening the financial sector safety net is crucial for maintaining financial stability during a macro-debt crisis, said Alexander Pankov, Lead Financial Sector Specialist and the Task Team Leader for the project. A robust deposit insurance system, along with enhanced supervision and resolution frameworks, will safeguard public confidence in the financial system and protect peoples savings. The SLDIS was established in 2010 and has conducted several payouts for failed licensed finance companies in recent years. Currently, the SLDIS guarantees the deposits of households and enterprises up to LKR 1,100,000, which covers more than 90 percent of deposit accounts in Sri Lanka. The legal framework for deposit insurance in Sri Lanka was upgraded earlier this year through the approval by Parliament of Banking Special Provisions Act. SLDIS should now be strengthened institutionally and financially for it to be able to effectively fulfill its legal mandate of protecting the financial sector stability. --World Bank",

Accordingly, he said, The Presidential Election cannot be held soon. Neither can it be delayed. It must be held between the 17th of September and 17th of October, 2024.",

        "date": "November 10, 2023 01:17 pm",
        "content": "Sri Lankan skipper Kusal Mendis has apologised for the squads poor performance at the 2023 ICC Mens Cricket World Cup, and assured that proper measures would be taken to avoid the repetition of such a fate. Speaking to the media upon arrival at the Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) in Katunayake this morning (10 Nov.), Mendis expressed his regret that despite playing their best as a team, the Sri Lanka squad was struck with continuous losses during the tournament. We started off well. And when we started losing matches, we looked at ways in which we could prevent this from happening, ways to better ourselves and we hoped to do our best as a team, the Sri Lankan skipper said. Responding to recent claims that the squad had a lack of sportsmanship and unity, Mendis asserted that he does not think this was the problem, or that the matter was even true about the team. I dont think that there was no unity amongst the team. Everyones eyes were on winning the tournament. I got a lot of support from the team, but winning and losing matches is a difficult matter for us to control. But we have to look at our upcoming matches, and take measures to perform better, he said. Despite having made a terrific entry into the 2023 ODI World Cup, Mendis failed to fire since he took over as captain. He was thrust into the skippers role after Dasun Shanaka injured himself and got ruled out of the entire tournament, foreign media reported. Mendis started the World Cup by hitting a magnificent half-century against South Africa at the Arun Jaitley Stadium in New Delhi. Mendis scored 76 runs off 42 balls, hitting eight boundaries and four sixes in a failed 429-run chase. Despite Sri Lanka losing the match, Mendis innings stood out as a sign of positive things to come for the 1996 champions.",

        "title": "Gaza officials say hospitals come under new Israeli attacks",
        "date": "November 10, 2023 01:40 pm",
        "content": "Gaza officials said Israel launched air strikes on or near at least three hospitals on Friday, further endangering a health system swamped with thousands of casualties and people displaced by Israels war against Hamas in the Palestinian enclave. The Israeli occupation launched simultaneous strikes on a number of hospitals during the past hours, Gaza Ministry of Health spokesman Ashraf Al-Qidra told Al Jazeera television. Qidra said Israel targeted the courtyard of Al Shifa, the biggest hospital in Gaza City, and there were casualties, but he did not provide details. Israel said Hamas has hidden command centres and tunnels beneath Al Shifa, allegations Hamas denies. Israels military did not immediately comment on Qidras statement, which Reuters could not independently verify. The month-old Israeli military campaign to wipe out Hamas, following the militants Oct. 7 raid on southern Israel, has left Gazas hospitals struggling to cope, as medical supplies, clean water and fuel to power generators have been running out. Gazas health ministry has said 18 of Gazas 35 hospitals and 40 other health centres were out of service either due to damage from bombardment or lack of fuel. Palestinian media published video footage on Friday of Al Shifa, which Reuters was unable to authenticate immediately, that it said showed the aftermath of an Israeli attack on a parking lot where displaced Palestinians were sheltered and journalists were observing. A pool of blood could be seen next to the body of a man being placed on a stretcher. With ongoing strikes and fighting nearby (Al Shifa), we are gravely concerned about the well-being of thousands of civilians there, many children among them, seeking medical care and shelter, Human Rights Watch said on social media site X. Qidra said Al-Rantisi Pediatric Hospital and Al-Nasr Childrens Hospital have been witnessing a series of direct attacks and bombardments on Friday. He said strikes on the hospital grounds at Al-Rantisi set vehicles on fire but they had been partly extinguished. Indonesias foreign ministry said on Friday there were explosions near the Indonesian Hospital overnight, which damaged parts of the hospital, located at the northern end of the narrow coastal enclave. It did not say who was responsible for the explosion and it did not report any deaths or injuries. Indonesia once again condemns the savage attacks on civilians and civilian objects, especially humanitarian facilities in Gaza, the ministry said in a statement. U.S. SAYS ISRAEL AGREES TO PAUSES Israel says 1,400 people, mostly civilians, were killed and about 240 taken hostage by Hamas in the Oct.7 raid that triggered the Israeli assault. Israel says it has lost 35 soldiers in Gaza. Palestinian officials said 10,812 Gaza residents had been killed as of Thursday, about 40 of them children, in air and artillery strikes. A humanitarian catastrophe has unfolded as basic supplies like food and water run out and shelling displaces civilians from their homes. Israels military has said it has evidence that Hamas uses Al Shifa and other hospitals such as the Indonesian Hospital to hide command posts and entry points to an extensive tunnel network under Gaza. It says it does not target civilians, and it has allowed some wounded Palestinian civilians to cross into Egypt for treatment. But Israels military advance on central Gaza City, which brought tanks within about 1.2 kilometre (34 mile) of Al Shifa, according to residents, has raised questions about how Israel will interpret international laws on protecting medical centres and displaced people sheltering there. Deadly air strikes on refugee camps, a medical convoy and near hospitals have already prompted fierce arguments among some of Israels Western allies over its militarys adherence to international law. U.S. President Joe Biden said in a post on X on Thursday that Israel has an obligation to distinguish between terrorists and civilians and fully comply with international law. The White House said on Thursday that Israel agreed to pause military operations in parts of north Gaza for four hours a day, but there was no sign of a let-up in the fighting. The pauses, which would allow people to flee along two humanitarian corridors and could be used for the release of hostages, were significant first steps, White House national security spokesperson John Kirby said. But Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu suggested any pauses would be scattered, and there was no official confirmation of a plan for recurring breaks. Asked if there would be a stoppage in fighting, Netanyahu said on the Fox News Channel: No. The fighting continues against the Hamas enemy, the Hamas terrorists, but in specific locations for a given period of a few hours here or a few hours there, we want to facilitate the safe passage of civilians away from the zone of fight and were doing that. On the ground in northern Gaza, there were no reports of a lull in fighting. Each side reported inflicting heavy casualties on the other in intense street battles. Source - Reuters - Agencies",

        "date": "November 10, 2023 04:26 pm",
        "content": "Surgeons have performed the worlds first ever whole-eye transplant, a feat hailed as a breakthrough despite the patient not yet regaining his sight. Doctors never expected it to work at all, patient Aaron James said, but the eye has shown signs of health, such as functioning blood vessels and a promising retina. It has been six months since the 21-hour surgery, performed during a partial face transplant in New York, but the surgeon who led the procedure said Mr James, 46, may yet see out of his left eye again. I dont think anyone can claim that he will see. But by the same token, they cant claim that he will not see, Dr Eduardo Rodriguez said. The mere fact that we transplanted an eye is a huge step forward, something that for centuries has been thought about, but its never been performed. Mr James, a military veteran from Arkansas, survived a work-related high-voltage electrical accident that destroyed the left side of his face, his nose, his mouth and his left eye in June 2021. He said he knew he might not regain his vision, but he had hoped that surgeons could learn something to help the next person. Hopefully this opens up a new path, he said. It feels good. I still dont have any movement in it yet. My eyelid, I cant blink yet. But Im getting sensation now, he added. Until now, doctors have only been able to transplant the cornea, the clear front layer of the eye. Initially, doctors were just planning to include the eyeball as part of the face transplant for cosmetic reasons, Dr Rodriguez said. If some form of vision restoration occurred, it would be wonderful, but... the goal was for us to perform the technical operation, Dr Rodriquez said, adding they aimed to have the eyeball survive. At this point, I think were pretty happy with the result that we were able to achieve with a very technically demanding operation. Mr Jamess eye will continue to be monitored, but right now it is not communicating with the brain through the optic nerve. To encourage connection between the donor and recipient optic nerves, surgeons harvested adult stem cells and injected them into the optic nerve during the transplant, hoping they would replace damaged cells. Transplantation of a viable eye opens many new possibilities, Dr Rodriguez said, even if sight is not restored in this case. Other research teams are developing ways to connect nerve networks in the brain to sightless eyes through insertion of electrodes, for example, to allow vision, he said. If we can work with other scientists that are working on other methods of restoring vision or restoring images to the visual cortex, I think were one step closer, he added.

A joint proposal regarding the removal of the Office Bearers of SLC brought forth by the government and the opposition, was also passed unanimously in Parliament without a vote on Thursday (09 Nov.), following a 7-hour parliamentary debate on the matter. The proposal expected to pass the stance that the Office Bearers of Sri Lanka Cricket should step down and a new legislation for the cricket administration is needed to be passed through a new Act in order to maintain a corruption-free, transparent cricket governance.",

During Thursdays COPF meeting, the committee members looked into the governments upcoming recurrent and capital expenditure allocations and the figures of the previous years. The COPF chairman pointed out that it is problematic that a large number of annual budget proposals are mere proposals. Although budget proposals are presented under every administration, only a paltry number of them are implemented, he said further, adding that this sets a bad precedent. Thus, MP de Silva went on to stress the importance of conducting a follow-up of the budget to make sure that the proposals are implemented properly. He said the follow-up regarding the upcoming budget should be done by the COPF and called for a detailed report before next Monday, on the number of proposals that have been executed after the previous budget.",

        "date": "November 11, 2023 08:56 am",
        "content": "The Board of Directors of International Cricket Council (ICC) has suspended the national cricket governing body, citing extensive government interference in its administration. The sanction came in the backdrop of Sports Minister Roshan Ranasinghes allegations about the misconduct of Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) officials. However, ESPNcricinfo reported that it is understood that SLC had asked the ICC board to take this extreme step, although the international cricket bodys decision appears to have come out of the blue. In a statement on Friday (Nov.10), the ICC said the SLC had breached its obligations as a member, in particular the requirement to manage its affairs autonomously and without government interference. The ICC said the conditions of the suspension would be decided by its Board in due course. The ICC Board is set to meet from November 18-21 in Ahmedabad, India, after which the future course of action is expected to be clearer. Sri Lanka is scheduled to host the ICC Under-19 Mens Cricket World Cup across January and February 2024. In a letter sent to the national cricket bodys president Shammi Silva on Friday, the ICC said it would continue to recognise the democratically elected office bearers of Sri Lanka Cricket for the purposes of the upcoming ICC Board meeting. As such, Silva has been asked to attend the meeting in his capacity as an ICC Director. ESPNcricinfo also reported that Silva, who is currently in India, had attended Fridays meeting as the elected representative. The national cricket issue snowballed after India thrashed the Lions by a mammoth 302 runs in the ODI 33 of the ongoing World Cup tournament. The Sri Lanka mens team has had a forgettable time at the 2023 ICC Mens Cricket World Cup, winning only 2 out of 9 matches and finishing with 4 points. They sit at No.8 in the points table with 3 more matches to be played in the league phase. Sports Minister Roshan Ranasinghe, calling SLC traitorous and corrupt in a statement made in parliament on November 03, urged the board members to resign. Following the resignation of SLC Secretary Mohan de Silva and the sacking of the board, Minister Ranasinghe replaced them with an interim committee chaired by World Cup-winning former captain and former minister Arjuna Ranatunga. However, ousted SLC President Shammi Silva filed a petition before the Appeals Court against the dismissal and was reiterated after being granted a two-week stay order, with a full hearing to follow. The matter was also discussed in Sri Lankas parliament this week. The cricket body also issued a statement addressing the allegations made by Minister Ranasinghe about the transfer of USD 2 million from its accounts, assuring that the funds were used for operational expenses only and not transferred out of their accounts. Further, the SLC said it would establish an independent committee to inquire into audit reports, and make recommendations to ensure the prevention of corruption. This independent panel will comprise of S. I. Imam, Retired Supreme Court Judge; Rohini Marasinghe, Retired Supreme Court Judge; and Irangani Perera, Retired High Court Judge. They are to be tasked with inquiring into and recommending appropriate action in relation to the references contained in the special audit report dated September 11, issued by the Auditor Generals Department, and subsequently make recommendations and formulate strategic actions to ensure the prevention of corruption, malpractices, irregularities, misconduct, and failures as referred to in the document. Against this backdrop, the parliament, on Thursday (Nov.09), unanimously passed a joint proposal regarding the removal of the SLC office bearers, brought forth by the government and the opposition. Addressing a meeting held with ruling party MPs later that day, President Ranil Wickremesinghe had said that he was of the view that that the best solution for the Sri Lanka Cricket crisis is to implement the draft constitution for the cricket governing body proposed in the report compiled by the committee headed by Justice K.T. Chitrasiri. Reiterating that he remains impartial in this matter, adding that he is on the side of cricket, President Wickremesinghe has pointed out that appointing interim committees is a band-aid solution and will not suffice to address the issue adequately.
