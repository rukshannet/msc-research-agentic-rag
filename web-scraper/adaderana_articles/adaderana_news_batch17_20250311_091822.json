        "title": "Privatisation of SriLankan Airlines is part of IMF program, says CEO",
        "date": "June 13, 2024 10:44 am",
        "content": "SriLankan Airline CEO Richard Nuttall said that the government is on its way to privatise several state-owned enterprises as part of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) program and one of those is the flag carrier of the island nation. The government is trying to privatise a number of state-owned enterprises as a part of the IMF program that its going through. One of those is SriLankan Airlines, Nuttall said speaking to ANI on Wednesday. Nuttall shared that one of the steps taken in that direction is the government helping with the balance sheet which will be completed in a month or two. There are two parts to that. One is, the government working to help us with our balance sheet and a lot of work has gone on with that and we expect that to be finished in the next one or two months, the CEO said. Nuttal said that the airline is also looking for an investor, three candidates have been finalised and the government is in talks with them. And then the other side is looking for an investor. Expressions of interest were completed in April and there were six candidates. Thats now been whittled down to three. So the government is now talking to three different entities and well see what happens from there, he said. The CEO shared that no Indian company has showed interest in investing in SriLankan Airlines but one of the consortiums have some Indians in them. Theres no Indian company, but one of them is a consortium that we understand has some Indian, Nuttar said. Replying to a question about the updates on the expansion plan of Sri Lankan Airlines, Nuttall said, At the moment, our fleet is 21. Were hoping for it to grow. It should grow to 22 next month. Were looking to get another three aircraft within the coming twelve months, so that would take us to 25. So if you look, weve also got a couple of aircraft that were replacing with engines. So thats about 50 per cent growth by the end of this year.The CEO further added that the expansion will be from increased frequencies to existing destinations rather than adding new destination cities. And I think most of the expansion that well get from that will be not new cities, but it will be increasing frequencies to existing destinations, particularly in India and Southeast Asia, he added. Nuttall said that during economic downturn that the island nation is currently facing, more people tend to go and work overseas which in turn helps the airline. If one looks at Sri Lanka, two of the biggest sources of currency for the country come from the diaspora, Sri Lankans working abroad and tourism. So actually when you have an economic downturn, more people go overseas. So its a natural hedge. So for the airline thats good and we can support the economic development of the country by supporting the people that want to go and work overseas, the CEO said. Nuttal highlighted that the tourism sector has recovered and back to pre-COVID times. He added that the Indian market has trebled in the last year. When it comes to tourism, actually tourism has come back really, really quickly to Sri Lanka. So tourism is now back where it was pre-COVID. And if we look at the Indian market, the Indian market has I think trebled in the last twelve months. We were doing roughly 1,012 thousand a month last year and now were up closer to 40,000, the CEO said. And the Indians are just over 20 per cent of the tourists that comes to Sri Lanka. And you know, realistically, when we look at the size of the population here and we look at the growing economy, we think that 40,000 a month is just the tip of the iceberg. We think that number could grow, Nuttal added. Source: ANI --Agencies",

        "title": "G7 leaders agree to lend Ukraine billions backed by Russias frozen assets",
        "date": "June 13, 2024 01:01 pm",
        "content": "Leaders of the Group of Seven wealthy democracies have agreed to engineer a 50 billion loan to help Ukraine in its fight for survival that would use interest earned on profits from Russias frozen central bank assets as collateral. Details of the deal were still being hashed out as G7 leaders gathered for a summit in Italy, but the money could reach Kyiv before the end of the year. Thats according to a French official who confirmed the agreement Wednesday ahead of a formal announcement at the summit. Heres how the plan would work: Where would the money come from? Most of the money would be provided in the form of a loan from the U.S. government that would be backed by windfall profits being earned on roughly 300 billion in immobilized Russian assets. The vast majority of the money is being held in European Union nations. A French official said that while the loan would be mostly U.S.-guaranteed, it could be topped up with European money or other national contributions. Why not just give Ukraine the frozen assets? Thats much harder to do. For more than a year, officials from multiple countries have debated the legality of confiscating the money and sending it to Ukraine. The U.S. and its allies immediately froze whatever Russian central bank assets they had access to when Moscow invaded Ukraine in 2022  basically, money being held in banks outside Russia. The assets are immobilized and cant be accessed by Moscow  but they still belong to Russia. While governments can generally freeze property or funds without difficulty, turning them into forfeited assets that can be used for the benefit of Ukraine requires an extra layer of judicial procedure, including a legal basis and adjudication in a court. So the European Union instead has set aside the windfall profits being generated by the frozen assets. That pot of money is easier to access. Separately, the U.S. earlier this year passed a law called the REPO Act  short for the Rebuilding Economic Prosperity and Opportunity for Ukrainians Act  that allows the Biden administration to seize 5 billion in Russian state assets located in the U.S. and use them for the benefit of Kyiv. That arrangement is still being worked out. How could the loan be used  and how soon? It will be up to technical experts to work through the details. But U.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan said Wednesday that the goal is to provide the necessary resources to Ukraine now for its economic energy and other needs so that its capable of having the resilience necessary to withstand Russias continuing aggression. Another goal is to get the money to Ukraine fast. The French official, who was not authorized to be publicly named according to French presidential policy, said the details could be worked out very quickly and in any case, the 50 billion will be disbursed before the end of 2024. Beyond the costs of the war, the needs are great. The World Banks latest damage assessment of Ukraine, released in February, estimates that costs for reconstruction and recovery of the nation stand at 486 billion over the next 10 years. The move to unlock Russias assets comes after there was a long delay by the U.S. Congress in approving military aid for Ukraine. At an Atlantic Council event previewing the G7 summit, former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine John Herbst said the fact that American funding is not quite reliable is a very important additional reason to go that route. Who would be on the hook in the case of a default? If Russia regained control of its frozen assets or if the immobilized funds werent generating enough interest to pay back the loan, then the question of burden-sharing arises, according to the French official. Who would shoulder the burden is still to be worked out, the official said. Max Bergmann, director of the Europe, Russia and Eurasia Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said last week that there were worries among European finance ministers that their countries will be left holding the bag if Ukraine defaults.

        "date": "June 13, 2024 07:30 pm",
        "content": "Sri Lanka Police says it has been uncovered that the incident where several gunshots had been fired at the vehicle belonging to former Anuradhapura District parliamentarian Uddika Premaratne, had been orchestrated by the actor-turned-politician himself with the assistance of an Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP) in the area. Speaking during a press conference held in Colombo today (13), the Police Media Spokesman DIG Nihal Thalduwa said that the suspects connected to the incident have been identified so far following investigations carried out by the CID. On September 17, 2023, a group of unidentified gunmen had opened fire at Premaratnes car soon after he returned to his residence in Anuradhapura at around 10:35 p.m. The parliamentarian had managed to escape unharmed. The perpetrators, who had arrived in a car, were said to have targeted the parliamentarian who was walking towards the house after parking his vehicle. The left rear door glass of Premaratnes car was damaged in the shooting incident for which the gunmen were believed to have used a pistol. Anuradhapura police initiated investigations soon after the incident was reported and Special Task Force (STF) personnel were deployed to beef up the security near the MPs house. Later, investigations into the matter were handed over to the Criminal Investigation Department (CID). However, the former MP claimed that the existing system within the country was the reason behind the recent shooting incident targeting him. Speaking in Parliament in this regard, MP Premaratne said that while he believed the system was the cause behind the recent shooting outside his residence, it is also the reason why the country is in the state it is today. Later on 27 February 2024, the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) MP resigned as a Member of Parliament, following which S.C. Muthukumarana of SLPP was appointed to fill the vacant MP seat. However, Premaratne was later reported to have flown to Canada, seeking political asylum, which he refuted, and claimed that he was expecting a work visa in Canada. In 2020, the popular actor was announced as a candidate for the 2020 parliamentary election from the Anuradhapura District as a member of the Sri Lanka Peoples Freedom Alliance, a political alliance led by the SLPP formed in 2019. He obtained 133,550 votes and won a seat in the 16th Parliament of Sri Lanka.",

        "date": "June 13, 2024 10:09 pm",
        "content": "West Indies left-arm spinner Gudakesh Motie won the ICC Mens Player of the Month award, while Sri Lanka skipper Chamari Athapaththu secured her second ICC Womens Player of the Month when she won the top prize for her performances in May 2024. Motie claimed the Mens award by beating competition from Pakistans Shaheen Shah Afridi and Lorcan Tucker of Ireland, while Chamari won the womens award by overcoming Scotlands Kathryn Bryce and Englands Sophie Ecclestone. In May, Motie took eight wickets at an average of 8.50 across the three-match series against South Africa in Jamaica, as the West Indies gathered valuable momentum in the lead-up to their Mens T20 World Cup campaign at home. Defending a score of 175 in the first contest, Motie played a pivotal part in restricting South Africas middle-order charge, with his 3-25 including the prized wicket of the dangerous Rassie van der Dussen. With a higher total to defend in the second match, the Guyanese once again hampered a promising South African run chase with career-best figures of 3-22. More success followed in the final outing, with the left-arm spinner exploiting conditions and varying his pace expertly in a spell of 2-21, which got him Player of the Series prize to accompany the 3-0 series sweep by the West Indies. It means a lot to me and I am thrilled to win this award. Its very encouraging, I have put in a lot of work during this season and I am happy that I am seeing the rewards now. The standout performance for me during the series against South Africa was the first game, where I took three for 25. The third wicket that night was my favourite. Playing in a World Cup means a lot to me, and playing at home in front of our fans and knowing the conditions is also special. We have started strongly, playing three games and getting three wins, and I see us going all the way and lifting that cup on June 29, said Motie to ICC. On the other hand, Chamari had plenty of success in May 2024 as she captained Sri Lanka to qualify for this years ICC Womens T20 World Cup 2024 in Bangladesh with a victorious campaign in the Qualifying tournament in Abu Dhabi. Chamari topped the run-scoring charts at the event and capped another fine spell of performances with 151 runs and six wickets in May, culminating in a sublime yet explosive 102 score in 63 balls against fellow finalists Scotland to guide Sri Lanka to the Qualifier trophy. I am extremely delighted and honoured to once again receive the ICC Womens Player of the Month Award, and wish to mention that continuous recognition at this level keeps me motivated to further up my game and continue the good performance. I wish to mention here that, both Kathryn (Bryce) and Sophie (Ecclestone) are also two exceptionally talented players with a proven record, and wish them the very best, whilst I thank my teammates for their support given to me in this endeavour, she said.

        "date": "June 14, 2024 09:05 am",
        "content": "The International Monetary Fund (IMF) says that there is sufficient progress for Sri Lankas Debt Restructuring process to move forward. However, the IMF further said Sri Lankas economy is still vulnerable and the path to debt sustainability remains knife- edged hence the country need to sustain the reform momentum. Meanwhile, joining the IMF press briefing on Sri Lankas second review of EFF program held virtually this morning (14), IMF Senior Mission Chief for Sri Lanka Peter Breuer stated that the IMF fully respect the democratic process for elections to take place in any country and they adapt to the relevant process. Furthermore, he mentioned that the elections may affect the timing of IMFs missions they conduct in order to discuss compliance with the programme and reforms going forward. We of course fully respect the democratic process for elections to take place in any country and we adapt to that process. So, this may affect a little bit the timing of our missions that we conduct in order to discuss compliance with the programme and reforms going forward, he said. The elections have not been called yet. We will await that and discuss with the authorities how we can adapt our schedule to that of the elections, Mr. Breuer added. In response to a question raised by a journalist whether there is scope to adjust the programme and reduce taxes by a newly appointed government following the elections, the IMF Senior Mission Chief for Sri Lanka expressed that it is significant how the reduction in government revenues had contributed to this very severe crisis in Sri Lanka. He further said: I just pointed you to these two charts in the IMF report to tell the story how the reduction in government revenues had contributed to this very severe crisis to this very severe crisis in Sri Lanka. Re-building these revenues is an important objective of the programme in order to allow Sri Lanka to emerge from the crisis. Of course here we should bring revenue closer to the expenditures that the government is facing to reduce the gap between expenditure and revenue, and that will help to make the debt sustainable again and force Sri Lanka to be able to finance itself at interest rates it can afford and the debt are sustainable. More broadly speaking, we are willing to listen to different views of how the programme objectives can be reached. These need to be realistic and achievable within the time frame of the programme, he added. Moreover, the IMF representative also stated that the Public Financial Management law has now been sent to Parliament, which will help to strengthen the fiscal framework and enhance fiscal responsibility. Mr. Breuer highlighted that the law will help to ensure that the funds are being spent by the government as intended.",

While joining Ada Deranas current Affairs Programme At HydePark this afternoon (13), Dr. Jayatilleka alleged that the government is not handling the external debt restructuring process in the best way possible. He further highlighted that the leaders of the country have managed Sri Lanka in such a way that it is now unable to be completely immune to external pressure when taking internal policy decisions. Commenting on the upcoming election, Dr. Jayatilleka said that Sri Lanka needs a leader with a popular mandate and that the country requires a generational shift in leadership in order to move forward.

        "title": "Upcoming election will be pivotal in determining countrys future trajectory  President",
        "date": "June 14, 2024 10:09 am",
        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe emphasized that he has not deviated from the principles of the democratic socialist system in Sri Lanka. He noted that two key objectives have been incorporated, ensuring that all citizens have an adequate standard of living and promoting rapid development across the country through public and private economic activities aimed at social objectives and the public good. President Wickremesinghe highlighted that the recently submitted Economic Transformation Bill is designed to achieve these ambitious goals within the framework of the constitution. He asserted that this legislation underscores his adherence to constitutional principles, thereby countering any accusations of unconstitutional actions. The President made these remarks during his keynote address at the inaugural session of the 45th SAARCFINANCE Governors Meeting and Symposium held Thursday (13) at the Hilton Hotel, Colombo. President Ranil Wickremesinghe noted that several countries in the region have recently held elections, resulting in the formation of new governments. He remarked that Sri Lanka is also approaching an election, which will be pivotal in determining the countrys future trajectory. The President emphasized the importance of this election, suggesting that it will decide whether Sri Lanka continues the cycle of changing governments every five years or sets a course for sustained national progress. President Ranil Wickremesinghe highlighted the International Monetary Funds (IMF) positive assessment of Sri Lankas efforts to rebuild its economy. He noted that Sri Lanka has met all its quantitative targets for the end of December 2023 under the current economic program, with the exception of the indicative target on social spending. Furthermore, by the end of April 2024, the country had achieved many structural targets. At a time when many doubted Sri Lankas ability to recover swiftly from its economic crisis, President Ranil Wickremesinghe expressed that the current situation has exceeded his expectations. He thanked all those who worked with him with confidence to achieve these results. The conference themed Central Banking amid Multi-Faceted Global Economic Challenges will take place over two days. Following is the full speech made by the President, The work we have been doing in the last two years, when many people didnt expect Sri Lanka to come out of this crisis so quickly, has been remarkable, President Wickremesinghe stated. He attributed this success to the dedicated efforts of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka, which played a crucial role in guiding the nation through challenging times by enforcing policies that curbed expenditure. He also expressed gratitude to the Government and Reserve Bank of India, as well as the Government and Central Bank of Bangladesh, for their financial support, which he described as lifesaving. This assistance, along with aid from USAID and the World Bank, was pivotal in stabilizing the countrys economy. President Wickremesinghe outlined future plans for Sri Lanka, including the introduction of the new Central Bank Act aimed at ensuring monetary stability. He also mentioned upcoming legislation such as the Public Debt Management Bill and the Public Finance Bill, which are expected to bolster financial and monetary stability in the country. The President underscored the importance of combating corruption and detailed the governments commitment to establishing a robust anti-corruption framework by 2025. He also highlighted the need for job creation and economic growth, stressing the importance of transforming Sri Lankas import-based economy into an export-driven one. Today morning, as the Governor mentioned, we had good news. Actually, it was better than what I anticipated. Because, reading briefly, weve been saying performance under the program has been strong. All quantitative targets for the end of December 2023 were met, except the indicative target on social spending. Most structural benchmarks due by the end of April 2024 were either met or implemented with delay. The work we have been doing in the last two years, when many people didnt expect Sri Lanka to come out of this crisis so quickly, has been remarkable. I was confident, and I am fortunate to have had a team that shared this confidence. I must acknowledge the role played by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka in guiding this group, especially under very difficult circumstances. They upheld policies requiring a curb on expenditure, something unfamiliar in Sri Lanka for a long time. I must also extend my thanks to the members of the Secretary and the Ministry of Finance, who, along with the Central Bank, were responsible for formulating the policy and handling the pressures of budgetary restrictions that the Central Bank did not have to face. Additionally, I must thank the Government and the Reserve Bank of India and the Government and the Central Bank of Bangladesh. That three and a half billion and that 200 million were lifesavers. Without that, we wouldnt be here today; there would have been chaos. Maybe this hotel would have burned down. Their support allowed us to obtain some fertilizer, which we received as aid from USAID, and assistance from the World Bank. That was a tough year. I wont delve into it here; it deserves a book, not merely one hour of discussion. Today, you are meeting to discuss the issues of central banking amid multifaceted global economic challenges. This topic requires in-depth discussion for this region. I need not elaborate on the role monetary policy has played since the 2009 crisis and the measures needed to recover from COVID. You are also facing two issues: where the power lies in Montrealis it exercised by the IMF with the present voting pattern? If not, whats the challenge that can be posed by the BRICS? These are concerns for all of us, and South Asia should take a similar stand, especially with the move towards de-globalization after years of being urged to globalize. What happens to the international monetary system? But I will not go into detail on those. I thought of speaking a few words about what Sri Lanka has achieved and what we plan to do in the coming years. To illustrate the depth of the crisis, let me provide a few facts. I was born in 1949. The fixed exchange rate at that time was 3 rupees 32 cents. In 1978, when I was in the Cabinet, we did away with the fixed exchange rate and moved to a floating exchange rate, which was 16 rupees per dollar. By 2009, we had reached 116 rupees to a dollar, despite expansive schemes like the Mahaweli Development Scheme, which required money printing. The IMF stated there was a moderate risk of external debt distress. After 2009, when the war was over, the Mahaweli Scheme made us self-sufficient in rice, saving foreign exchange. Our free trade zones ensured our manufactured goods were exported, and we had a thriving tourist industry. By 2024, people expected the rate to reach 400 rupees per dollar. Today, its at 300 rupees. So, the story from 1949 to 2024 highlights that the growth of the economy often relied more on printing money than on central bank policies. As a borrower, we either borrowed money or printed it. Fortunately, I was in a good position because my family was involved in printing, so I understood its limits. The new Central Bank Act, which we have presented, aims to ensure monetary stability. The central bank cannot grant credit to the government. There is no way to obtain loans from the central bank, nor can money be printed or taken from the state bank. This forces us to look at how to raise revenue. Additionally, there are inflation targets. We have three laws: the Central Bank Act, the Public Debt Management Bill, and the Public Finance Bill, both of which will be passed by Parliament. These will form the framework of our financial and monetary stability. Once we carry this through, I see Sri Lanka achieving stability in monetary and fiscal affairs for the next decade or more. The second issue is corruption. Corruption has been a significant issue in Sri Lanka, and everyone talks about how to address it. No one tells us how to catch them. Thats the problem. So my government has come to an agreement and discussed the matter with the IMF. We also required their help, and we brought the governance diagnostic report. Many laws have to be passed. One has been passed, the Anti-Corruption Act. The second one, proceeds of crime legislation, is now being drafted to be sent to Parliament. There are a series of other laws that are required. By 2025, we will have the strongest anti-corruption system in South Asia and even, I think, in Southeast Asia, except for one or two countries. So this brings us to the next part of the issue. Now we have stability. The next issue is the one that worries all politicians: jobs. How do you create jobs? There are a large number of people in our country who expect jobs. As the level of education goes up, they are not satisfied with just a menial job; they expect satisfactory jobs. In our country, virtually everyone has a mobile phone or two at most. But what is the expectation of a job? We have to realize that our per capita income also has to increase as we find jobs in this area. This is also a growth area. I was reading some reports, and Id like to read from them. One of the World Bank reports on growth for 2024 states that growth in South Asia is expected at 6 for 2024. Its one of the highest, but structural challenges hinder the ability to create jobs and respond to climate shocks. Are we going to get stuck with jobless growth, destabilizing the system? Or are we looking at growth? This is what I thought we should address in Sri Lanka. We are all in this traditional British system where we dont address the major policy changes required. We pass various enactments creating one authority or abolishing it and creating another one, but the total framework is not created by us. In many other countries, you find certain laws on economic development and regulating the financial system. We havent got that. We stick with the British policy of not doing it. Britain accepts a free market economy. We are in countries where its all debated: Do you want a free market economy, a socialist economy, a Marxist economy, a controlled economy, or socialism with Chinese characteristics or with Vietnamese characteristics? We just cant make up our minds about what we want and what our goals are. I thought we should bring in the third part of the legislation, which is the most important to me: How do we ensure economic growth? What do we do? For Sri Lanka to attain growth, we have to transform our import-based economy into an export-driven economy. As the IMF report says, Nevertheless, the economy is still vulnerable, and the path to debt sustainability remains knife-edge. Sustaining the reform momentum and efforts to restructure debt are critical to putting the economy on a path toward lasting recovery and debt sustainability. As a result, we have decided to bring a new law called the Economic Transformation Law. Weve had laws from the British rule onwards that created a colonial market economy dependent on plantations. In 1972, there was a breakup of capital formation and a strictly controlled economy. From post-1977, we started gradually liberalizing, but we did not bring the necessary legislation. A series of legislation brought in the 1972 economy, but we were chipping away after that. Each time we chipped away, there was some demonstration outside or a campaign against it. Nevertheless, we chipped away. I said, forget about that. Lets put the new economy into place. We have failed; theres no need to be shy about what you are doing. Do it and be done with it. Thats what Erhard did in Germany, what the Japanese did after the war, what the Chinese did, and what the Vietnamese did. Theres nothing to be frightened of. I have not in any way departed from the principles of the democratic socialist system in our country. I have, in fact, incorporated two of the objectives: to ensure that all citizens have an adequate standard of living, and to create rapid development of the whole country by means of public and private economic activity towards social objectives and the public good. First, I put down in the law that I am working within this constitution. No one can say that I am going outside the objectives of the constitution. These two provisions are more than enough to rewrite the economic policy of Sri Lanka. It has to be growth-oriented; others have failed. In clause 3, section 3, I put down that the national policy on economic transformation must provide for the restructuring of the debt owed by the government. The public debt to GDP ratio shall be below 95 by the year 2032. These are IMF targets. The central government annual gross financing needs to GDP ratio shall be below 13 by 2032. Now that is in the law. That is what we agreed with the IMF. The central government annual debt service in foreign currency to GDP shall be below 4.5 by 2027 and thereafter. This is one part of the national policy on economic transformation, which has some of the factors to be provided in the national economic transformation. The second part is the transformation of Sri Lanka to a highly competitive export-oriented digital economy. This is a legal obligation, including diversification and deep structural changes in the national economy to boost competitiveness. The law states that we must have deep structural changes. I wonder if anyone can go to court and take action if we dont have deep structural changes. Achieving net zero by the year 2050, increasing integration with the global economy, achieving stable macroeconomic balances and sustainable debt, modernizing agriculture to boost farmer productivity, incomes, and agriculture exports, and promoting inclusive economic growth and social progress are also part of the plan. The cabinet of ministers, in formulating the national policy on economic transformation, must ensure the following targets: GDP growth to reach 5 annually by 2027 and above 5 thereafter. Unemployment should be below 5 of the labour force by 2025. Female labour force participation should reach not less than 40 by 2030 and not less than 50 by 2040. The current account deficit of the balance of payments shall not exceed 1 of GDP annually. Exports of goods and services as a percentage of GDP should reach not less than 25 by 2025, not less than 40 by 2030, and 60 by 2040. Net foreign direct investment as a percentage of GDP should reach not less than 5 by 2030 and not less than 40 after 2030. The primary balance in the government budget should reach 2.3 of GDP until 2032 and at least 2 from 2032. Government revenue should reach at least 15 of GDP beyond 2027. The multi-dimensional poverty headcount ratio should be less than 15 by 2027 and 10 by 2035. These are difficult targets, but unless you make it difficult, you cant succeed. If a government feels that it cant achieve this, it must go to Parliament and get the act amended. Otherwise, you must act within this framework. This is opening up the system fully, and thats what we are aiming for. It also means that, as I have done earlier, we all work together. I meet with the governor, my economic advisor, and others weekly. But it means that we can now put together a mechanism. A legal mechanism has to come into place, either by cabinet vision regulations or by law. We have the central bank, the treasury, and economic advisors all working together to achieve this objective. Now, to begin with, I want to ensure that the initial beneficiaries of the measures we have taken with the IMF are the ordinary people of Sri Lanka. They are the ones who suffered most. They are the ones who lost their jobs, had to mortgage their properties, and sell their land. To ensure that, I have said that we should ensure the money goes to the bottom. Stabilizing the rupee and bringing interest rates down has been one benefit. With the help of the World Bank, we have increased social welfare payments threefold. From 1.8 million families, it will go up to 2.4 million families. Thats at the very bottom. We gave government workers a Rs. 10,000 allowance, and the private sector followed. The government ordered plantation companies, which had refused, to make a payment of Rs. 1,350 per day. It was a challenging course, and the court threw out the challenge. So we have ensured that money goes in. We also created a district development budget. These are decentralized funds to build roads in villages or put up buildings, which means giving money to small contractors and others in the area. A fair amount has been given to the people. Since 1935, the government has been giving out land for people to cultivate, but never ownership, only through a permit. Similarly, we have built houses for low-income families in and around the city of Colombo, which are again given for rent. We took a policy decision, which we are implementing now, that all lands given to average people for building houses or for cultivating will now be given as freehold land. For those who have these low-income apartments, we will give title deeds, which means 2 million additional families are going to get this money. These are bankable assets, so look at how the banking service expands and how you take it to rural areas. We are also bringing in new laws to change vocational training because large numbers go into vocational training more than university as they look for employment. These are some of the measures we are taking to ensure that the lower end of the population benefits from the measures we take. It cannot be confined to a few at the top. We want the big companies to expand, and Im happy to see many of them expanding. We have already got hotels in the Maldives, and now we have investments in Bangladesh. We are seeing Indian investments coming into Sri Lanka. As we expand, I think we can deal with the economic issues relating to collaboration. We are at a very significant moment. In many of the countries, we have just won elections, and new governments have come in. In Sri Lanka, we are going in for elections. Expectations are high. Is it going to be the usual way where we change the government every five years, or are we really going to deliver? The central banks have a major role to play in this.

        "date": "June 14, 2024 11:29 am",
        "content": "A senior Kenyan police officer has been shot dead after he opened fire at a magistrate in court in the capital, Nairobi. The chief inspector opened fire on Makadara Principal Magistrate Monica Kivuti shortly after she made a ruling in a case reportedly involving his wife. The officer is said to have been angered by the courts decision to cancel her bail after she had absconded. The officer, identified as Samson Kipchirchir Kipruto, who is in charge of a police station in Londiani in western Kenya, then pulled out a gun and shot the magistrate, injuring her. Other officers in court responded immediately, with one of them shooting the offending policeman and killing him. In the process, three other officers were injured, a police report said. The magistrate and the injured officers are being treated in hospital. The judiciary said the magistrate had cancelled the bond for an accused person who had jumped bond and had failed to offer satisfactory explanations for jumping bond. Immediately this decision was pronounced, a person shot at the magistrate and injured her on the hip, it said in a statement. It noted initial reports that indicated that the shooter is a police officer who is married to the suspect. The national police service said the officer was in the court for unknown reasons. Investigations are continuing to establish the circumstances that led to the shooting, it said. The incident inside a courtroom has come as a shock to Kenyans. The police have often been accused of being involved in extra-judicial killings but no such incident has been reported inside court. The judiciary has said it will enhance security measures and has assured judicial staff and other court users of their safety and security. As the judiciary family, we wish our colleague a quick recovery. We also send our condolences to the family of the officer who lost his life in this unfortunate incident, said chief registrar of the judiciary Winfridah Mokaya. Source: BBC --Agencies",

        "title": "Tesla investors back record-breaking Musk pay deal",
        "date": "June 14, 2024 11:37 am",
        "content": "Tesla shareholders have backed a record-breaking pay package for boss Elon Musk and approved a plan to move the firms legal headquarters to Texas. The package was blocked earlier this year by a judge in Delaware over concerns it was unfair to shareholders. The vote is a victory for the multi-billionaire, who had campaigned fiercely for the payout, which is worth up to 56bn (43.9bn) - the exact amount depends on the Tesla share price. Hot damn, I love you guys, he told a crowd of enthusiastic shareholders who had gathered in Texas for the firms annual meeting. However, the vote is not binding and legal experts have said it is not clear if the court that blocked the deal will accept the re-vote and allow the company to restore the pay package. The vote changes nothing, said Mathieu Shapiro, a managing partner at law firm Obermayer Rebmann Maxwell  Hippel. It only offers Tesla opportunities to try to use the vote to obtain a better decision going forward, he added. The eye-popping sum had sparked criticism and raised concerns that the board of the company was too submissive and close to Mr Musk. Mr Musk announced that he wanted to move the firms legal headquarters to Texas after a judge in Delaware, where it is currently incorporated, voided his pay package, siding with a small investor who had sued over the deal. The fight over the plan had aired concerns about Mr Musks leadership, at a time when Teslas share price has fallen from its height and its position in the electric car industry is under pressure. But Mr Musk rallied his fan base in support of the deal, appealing particularly to individual investors, who make up an unusually large portion of the firms shareholder base. Its a pretty ringing endorsement, said car industry analyst Karl Brauer. Mr Musk got more than enough shareholder support to justify the package, he added. The company did not immediately disclose the margin of the vote. Mr Musk had previewed the results in a post on his social media company, X, formerly known as Twitter. Shares in the company closed up nearly 3 after Mr Musks announcement. The compensation plan gives Mr Musk rights to roughly 300 million shares  a roughly 10 stake in the firm - as a reward for the firm meeting goals once considered unfeasible, like becoming a 650bn firm. My understanding is that theres been about 1,100 appreciation in Tesla stock. And thats pretty, pretty impressive. Most chief executives have never done anything like that, said Mr Brauer. In the ruling earlier this year, Judge Kathaleen McCormick ruled the sum was unfair and the process for determining the package, by a board dominated by Mr Musk, was deeply flawed. Tesla called the decision fundamentally unfair, and inconsistent with the will of the stockholders. The company then submitted the deal to another vote - and asked its shareholders to back a plan to reincorporate the company outside the state of Delaware. It will be interesting to see if another court is willing to credit a vote taken after the trial courts decision, noted Mr Shapiro. The board said Mr Musk deserved the package because Tesla achieved its ambitious targets under his leadership and that it was necessary to ensure he remains dedicated to the company. Tesla executives also expressed support for the package in social media posts, saying that Mr Musk is crucial to the companys success. Meanwhile, Mr Musk promised a personal tour of Teslas factory in Texas to some shareholders who cast votes. The package - worth an estimated 300 times what the top-earning boss in the US made last year - won backing from 73 of shareholders who voted six years ago. Shareholders also approved the re-election of two board members at the meeting on Thursday: James Murdoch, the son of media tycoon Rupert Murdoch, and Mr Musks brother Kimbal Musk.

State Minister Ashoka Priyantha disclosed these details on Thursday (13) during a press briefing titled Collective Path to a Stable Country at the Presidential Media Centre. Addressing the media personnel, the state minister further stated that, The government has recently undertaken several significant projects, such as Urumaya and Aswasuma. Additionally, many development projects that were halted last season have now resumed. Redevelopment efforts in both villages and towns are also underway through decentralized allocations. It is important to note that supporting these initiatives is the duty of government officials. As we fulfil our responsibilities to the people, it is essential that everyone performs their duty. When we assumed the duties of these ministries, the country faced numerous challenges. Nonetheless, we have made steady progress in strengthening public services. Despite the initial inability to recruit for public service, we managed to appoint GN officers for 1,942 Grama Niladhari Divisions, and their training is currently underway. Additionally, the issue of the Grama Niladhari Service Constitution had persisted for a long time. The newly proposed service constitution has now been approved by the Public Service Commission following the endorsement of the Cabinet Ministers. Provisions have been made to amend this constitution if necessary. During the trade union actions of the GN officers, a disaster struck. However, government officials, along with the majority of GN officers in the country, stepped up and fulfilled their duties. At the moment, we extend our gratitude to all of them. Additionally, rural food security and nutrition committees were established across the country, enabling the provision of a safe and healthy diet to the population. --PMD--",

        "title": "Rare twin elephants born in Thailand miracle",
        "date": "June 14, 2024 01:38 pm",
        "content": "An Asian elephant in central Thailand has given birth to a rare set of twins, in what caretakers have described as a miracle. The mother, 36-year-old Chamchuri, was not expected to deliver twins and when she gave birth to a male calf last Friday, staff at the Ayutthaya Elephant Palace and Royal Kraal, had thought the delivery was done. But while cleaning up the first calf and helping it stand on its feet, they heard a loud thud and realised that Chamchuri had given birth to a second calf, a female. The second birth sent the mother into a panic and caretakers had to restrain her to prevent her from stepping on the female calf. One caretaker was hurt in the melee. Dramatic footage on social media showed a crowd of caretakers - known locally as mahouts - frantically separating the female calf from the mother, with blood from the birth still visible on her hind legs. Twins occur in only one percent of elephant births and male-female are even more rare, according to Save the Elephants, a research organisation. Once we pulled the second baby elephant out, away from the mother, the baby stood up. We were all cheering because its a miracle, veterinarian Lardthongtare Meepan told the BBC. Weve always wanted to see elephant twins but not everyone can see this because it doesnt happen a lot, said Ms Meepan, who grew up at the elephant park, and is herself a mother of twins. Charin Somwang, a 31-year-old mahout, broke his leg while restraining the mother. I was so happy, I couldnt feel the pain, he told the BBC, adding he felt the extent of the injuries only when he was brought to the hospital. Its normal that the new mother will always try to kick or push the baby... I was afraid that she might break the baby elephant, so I put myself forward and tried to block the mother from the smaller one, said Mr Somwang, who has been working at the park for 15 years. Elephants are considered sacred in Thailand, where a majority of the population is Buddhist. They are also a national symbol. Since the birth, the Ayutthaya Elephant Palace and Royal Kraal has featured the twins in live streams on social media. Park visitors, including children, are also allowed to see the twins, but only after disinfecting their footwear and their hands. A sign near the nursery reads: Please dont touch the elephant babies. They will be named seven days after birth in accordance with Thai custom. At 55kg (121lb) the female calf is slightly smaller than usual and has to step on a stool during feeding with her mother. Her brother is heavier at 60kg. The park claims its elephants were rescued from begging on the streets. In 1989, Thailand banned logging in natural forests, leaving mahouts who worked in that industry jobless. This forced them to make elephants perform tricks for tourists in exchange for money. This practice was outlawed in 2010 - though there are still rare cases of this happening. In Ayutthaya, Thailands former capital, some elephants carry tourists on their backs to temples and historic ruins. Conservationists oppose elephant riding as they say this stresses the animals out and amounts to abuse. An earlier report by the World Animal Protection (WAP) says that harsh methods are used to get a wild elephant to carry a human on its back. The process starts soon after it is captured. It is often referred to as breaking-in or crush. Aside from Ayutthaya, elephants have also become tourist draws in highland villages in Chiang Rai and Chiang Mai in the north, where tourists can feed them with bananas, go walking with them and bathe them with mud. The Asian elephant is an endangered species due to poaching, illegal trade and habitat loss, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature. More elephants are used for tourism in Thailand - over 3,000 - than anywhere else. Unlike other countries with captive populations, those in Thailand are nearly all privately owned. Compared to their African counterparts, Asian elephants have smaller ears round and hunched backs. Meanwhile, visitors continue to flock to the park in Ayutthaya to see the twin babies, as they await their names. They walk in a small pen covered with hay as they roll their trunks on their mothers leg. I am always happy when I see elephant gives birth, said Mr Somwang, their mahout who is recovering from injury. It doesnt need to be twins. Elephant babies always bring joy, he said.

        "date": "June 14, 2024 03:21 pm",
        "content": "Senior officials of South Korea and the United States held an emergency phone call over a possible impending visit by Russian President Vladimir Putin to North Korea, Seouls foreign ministry said on Friday (June 14). South Koreas vice foreign minister, Kim Hong-kyun, in the phone call with US Deputy Secretary of State Kurt Campbell, said that Putins visit should not result in deeper military co-operation between Pyongyang and Moscow in violation of UN Security Council resolutions, the ministry said. Echoing Kims concerns, Campbell pledged continued co-operation to tackle potential regional instability and challenges caused by the trip. While closely monitoring related developments, the two sides agreed to resolutely respond through airtight co-operation to North Koreas provocations against South Korea and actions that escalate tensions in the region, the ministry said in a statement. On Wednesday, a senior official at Seouls presidential office said Putin was expected to visit North Korea in the coming days. Russias Vedomosti newspaper on Monday reported Putin would visit North Korea and Vietnam in the coming weeks. Civilian aircraft have been cleared from Pyongyangs airport and there are signs of preparations for a possible parade in the capitals Kim Il-sung Square, NK PRO, a Seoul-based website, reported this week, citing commercial satellite imagery. When Sergei Shoigu, then Russias defence minister, visited Pyongyang last year to jumpstart the two countries warming ties, he accompanied Kim to a parade and saluted as North Koreas banned nuclear-tipped missiles rolled by. Speaking at the Stimson Centre think tank in Washington on Wednesday, Campbell said the United States has a very good understanding of what North Korea has provided Russia, which he said has had a substantial impact on the battlefield. Less clear, he said, is what Russia has provided North Korea. Hard currency? Is it energy? Is it capabilities that allow them to advance their nuclear or missile products? We dont know. But were concerned by that and watching carefully, he said. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "date": "June 14, 2024 04:55 pm",
        "content": "Sri Lankas economy is expected to expand by 2.2 percent in 2024, according to the World Banks latest Global Economic Prospects report issued on Friday (14). The report indicates that this is a 0.5-percentage-point upward revision from Januarysupported by modest recoveries in remittances and tourism. Meanwhile, it highlights that in 2025-2026, growth is projected to strengthen further, reaching 3 in 2026, assuming successful debt restructuring negotiations and the implementation of structural reforms, which would offset the adverse impact of planned fiscal consolidation on growth. In its latest Global Economic Prospects report, the World Bank says that in the South Asian Region (SAR), economic spillovers from outside the region tend to be limited, because the region is generally less open to international trade than other parts of the world. However, weaker-than projected growth in major trading partners could damage growth in several countries, particularly Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka, it added. For example, China accounts for a high share of imports of intermediate goods in these countries, and softerthan-projected activity in China could cause a decline in receipt of intermediate goods, which would result in shortages in input materials and dampen activity. In addition, countries in Europe are the main export destination for these countries, and weaker-than expected demand in Europe, particularly the euro area, could cause a slowdown in export activity. An upside risk to regional growth is stronger-than projected activity in the United States. This could stimulate faster growth, especially in countries that are large exporters to the United Statesincluding Pakistan and Sri Lanka. Another upside risk is greater progress in lowering global inflation, which could lead to faster-than-expected easing of monetary policy, reducing borrowing costs and improving the growth outlook, the report highlighted. Additionally, the World Bank states in its report that the growth in South Asian Region is estimated to have increased to 6.6 percent in 2023, largely driven by faster growth in India. In early 2024, strong activity continued in India. While private sector activity picked up in several countries, including Pakistan and Sri Lanka, it remained weak, it added. In Sri Lanka, after contracting in 2023, activity has strengthened and tourism and remittances have also recovered, though they have remained below pre-pandemic levels, as per the World Bank report. Moreover, the World Bank indicates that foreign exchange reserves have increased in several countries, including Pakistan and Sri Lanka, reflecting the easing of currency pressures and receipts of official flows, but reserve levels in some countries remain low. In SAR, economic spillovers from outside the region tend to be limited, because the region is generally less open to international trade than other parts of the world. However, weaker-thanprojected growth in major trading partners could damage growth in several countries, particularly Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka, the report mentioned. Additionally, an upside risk to regional growth is stronger-thanprojected activity in the United States, the World Bank said, adding that this could stimulate faster growth, especially in countries that are large exporters to the United Statesincluding Pakistan and Sri Lanka.

        "date": "June 14, 2024 09:18 pm",
        "content": "Minister of Sports Harin Fernando, while speaking to the media this afternoon (14), expressed his views regarding Sri Lankan teams early elimination from the ICC T20 World Cup 2024. Accordingly, Fernando stated that continuous losing of matches in this manner has been an issue for several years and that a long-term solution is needed to solve the relevant issue. The Sports Minister further alleged that the Sri Lanka Cricket was already suspended and everything was messed up when he took over the relevant ministry. In response to a question raised by a journalist regarding future steps for the development of cricket, Fernando jokingly said: I hope to play cricket. You are asking what I can do as the Sports Minister to this issue? What can I do if they keep losing the matches? Then I will have to go and play cricket. That is not possible. This issue was there for several years. We will need a long-term solution for this. This (SLC) was already suspended and everything was messed up when I took over the ministry, he added. Sri Lanka became the third team after Oman and Namibia to be officially knocked out of the 2024 T20 World Cup in the Caribbean and United States. Following defeats in each of their first two games and a washout in their third encounter against Nepal in Florida, Sri Lanka needed a washout between Bangladesh and Netherlands in St. Vincent to stay alive in the tournament. A washout would have left both Bangladesh and Netherlands with three points each, in which case Sri Lanka would have had a mathematical chance to make it to the Super 8s, heading into the final round of fixtures in Group D. But the completion of the fifth over of Netherlands chase  which ensured there would be a result in the contest, meaning one of Netherlands or Bangladesh would get to 4 points  officially knocked Sri Lanka out of the tournament. This result draws curtains on a shocking T20WC campaign for the 2014 champions. They entered the tournament with optimism but got embarrassed in their first group game, getting bowled out for 77 against South Africa. Wanindu Hasarangas side then lost a close encounter against arch-rivals Bangladesh. There, they suffered a fatal collapse, finishing at 1249 after being 1003 at one stage. Sri Lanka, thus, have failed to make it to the final four of the T20 World Cup for the fourth straight edition. They last made the last four in 2014 when they ended up winning the trophy by beating India in the final.",

        "title": "Cyril Ramaphosa re-elected South African president",
        "date": "June 15, 2024 08:58 am",
        "content": "South Africas parliament has re-elected Cyril Ramaphosa as the countrys president following a landmark coalition deal between the governing African National Congress (ANC) and opposition parties. The new government of national unity combines Mr Ramaphosas ANC, the centre-right Democratic Alliance (DA) and smaller parties. In his victory speech, Mr Ramaphosa hailed the new coalition, and said voters expected the leaders to to act and to work together for the good of everyone in our country. The agreement was hashed out on a day of high political drama, which saw the National Assembly sitting late into the evening for votes to confirm who would hold power in the new administration. Earlier, a deal was struck following weeks of speculation about whom the ANC would partner with after losing its parliamentary majority for the first time in 30 years in last months elections. It got 40 of the vote, while the DA came second with 22. ANC secretary-general Fikile Mbalula called the coalition deal a remarkable step. It meant Mr Ramaphosa - who replaced Jacob Zuma as both president and ANC leader following a bitter power struggle in 2018 - was able to retain power. The next step is for Mr Ramaphosa to allocate cabinet positions, which will include members of the DA. The multi-party deal does not involve two ANC breakaway parties, and they will probably benefit if it fails to deliver economic improvements demanding by voters. But opinion polls suggest many South Africans want this unprecedented grand coalition to succeed. The ANC had always polled above 50 since the countrys first democratic elections in 1994, which saw Nelson Mandela become president. However, support for the party has been dropping significantly because of anger over high levels of corruption, unemployment and crime. Addressing South Africas parliament after his confirmation, Mr Ramaphosa called back to his partys first presidential victory 30 years ago. We have been here before, we were here in 1994, when we sought to unite our country and to effect reconciliation - and we are here now, he said. An alliance between the centre-right DA and the ANC is unprecedented as the two parties have been rivals for decades. Under Nelson Mandela, the ANC led the campaign against the racist system of apartheid and won the countrys first democratic elections. The DAs critics have accused it of trying to protect the economic privileges the countrys white minority built up during apartheid - a charge the party denies. Addressing lawmakers late on Friday in Cape Town, John Steenhuisen, the leader of the DA, said: Today is a historic day for our country, and I think it is the start of a new chapter. The National Assembly also swore in a speaker from the ANC, while the post of deputy speaker went to the DA. Among the party leaders speaking after the agreement was reached on Friday was Julius Malema, head of the Economic Freedom Fighters - the party he founded after leaving the ANC in 2013. He said while his party accepted the results and the voice of the people of South Africa, he criticised the agreement, saying: We do not agree to this marriage of convenience, to consolidate the white monopoly power over the economy and the means of production in South Africa.

The draft was handed over to President Ranil Wickremesinghe by the Committee Chairman, retired Supreme Court Judge K.T. Chitrasiri, accompanied by other committee members. To address the challenges faced by Sri Lanka Cricket and provide appropriate recommendations, a Cabinet Sub-Committee was appointed on November 6, 2023. Chaired by Minister of Foreign Affairs and Presidents Counsel Ali Sabry, the sub-committee included Minister of Power and Energy Kanchana Wijesekara, Minister of Labour and Foreign Employment Manusha Nanayakkara, and Minister of Public Security Tiran Alles. Following extensive discussions with stakeholders involved in cricket, the sub-committee presented its report to the Cabinet on January 8, 2024. The recommendations covered several key areas, including the composition and structure of the Sri Lanka Cricket Board, administration, training, and the overall well-being of players at various levels such as the national mens and womens teams, and the under-19 and under-17 age groups.

        "content": "A high level delegation headed by the State Minister of Foreign Affairs Tharaka Balasuriya is scheduled to visit Russia to arrange for the repatriation of Sri Lankan ex-military personnel deployed in Russia for military purposes and the related discussions will be held on June 26 and 27, said Minister of Foreign Affairs, Presidents Counsel Ali Sabry. The Minister also noted that a team of officials has been tasked with reviewing the Cabinet paper submitted to decide on Sri Lankas potential membership in the BRICS organization. Their report is anticipated later this month. Minister of Foreign Affairs, Presidents Counsel Ali Sabry, highlighted this during his participation in a Press conference at the Presidential Media Centre, focusing on the theme Collective Path to a Stable Country The minister elaborated further, stating, President Ranil Wickremesinghe visited India to take part in the swearing-in ceremony of Sri Narendra Modi, the Prime Minister of India. Consequently, we anticipate a visit from the Indian Minister of Foreign Affairs to Sri Lanka later this month, with the Prime Minister of India expected to follow suit shortly. Our government has achieved significant milestones during this period. The third tranche of the International Monetary Funds (IMF) Extended Fund Facility (EFF) was released to Sri Lanka, endorsing the hard work we have put in over the past 12 to 18 months. This includes controlling inflation, managing interest rates, building up reserves, promoting investment, and advancing renewable energy. These efforts indicate that we are on the right path. Our negotiations with bondholders and official creditors have been progressing well. We expect to sign agreements with official creditors very soon. Positive discussions with foreign bondholders indicate potential success, paving the way for Sri Lanka to transition from a debt-defaulter to a debt-repaying nation. Japan has indicated that they will resume suspended projects once the repayment commences. I plan to visit Japan in early July at the invitation of the Foreign Minister of Japan, hoping to finalize the resumption of these projects before my visit. Additionally, following a request from the Japanese Foreign Minister, I am scheduled to visit Japan next month. Japan has assured us that upon reaching an agreement with bilateral official creditors, all development projects in Sri Lanka previously initiated with Japanese assistance, but currently halted, will resume. Recently, I attended the BRICS Foreign Ministers Conference in Russia, representing Sri Lanka. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has submitted a Cabinet paper to explore the possibility of Sri Lanka joining the BRICS organization. A team comprising officials from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Treasury, Ministry of Finance, and Central Bank has been tasked with studying this proposal. The Cabinet is expected to receive their report later this month. Furthermore, discussions with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov focused on resolving the issue of Sri Lankan ex-military personnel serving in the Russian army. To address this, State Minister of Foreign Affairs, and a delegation including Secretary to the Defence Ministry will visit Russia. These discussions are scheduled for June 26th and 27th. Concurrently, efforts have commenced to facilitate the safe return of Sri Lankans currently stranded in Myanmar. -PMD-",

        "title": "Israeli troops catapult fireball into Lebanon using weapon rarely used since 16th century",
        "date": "June 15, 2024 04:14 pm",
        "content": "Israeli troops have used a medieval-style catapult to toss fireballs across the border into Lebanon, as fighting ramps up between Israel and the Iran-backed Islamist group Hezbollah. The trebuchet, a rotating arm with a sling attached to launch a projectile, has rarely been used since the 16th century. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said the catapult was a local initiative and had not come into widespread use, Israeli public broadcaster and CNN affiliate Kan reported Thursday. Kan said the trebuchet was probably used to burn shrubbery, making it easier for Israeli forces to identify militants attempting to reach the border. CNN has asked the IDF for comment. A video of the catapult in action was posted on social media on Wednesday. CNN could not verify when the footage was filmed but geolocated it to the Israeli-Lebanese border. While there have been reports of catapults being used by Ukrainian demonstrators during the Euromaidan protests in 2014, and by Syrian rebels in 2013, the weapon is a relic of bygone military ages. One of the last recorded uses of a large-scale trebuchet in warfare was by the Spanish conquistador Hernán Cortés against the Aztecs during the assault on Tenochtitlán, Mexico in 1521, according to the Encyclopedia Britannica. The use of trebuchets and other catapults began to dwindle after the invention of modern gunpowder artillery in the 15th century. The video comes after cross-border attacks from Lebanon led to large fires blazing through the north of Israel last week, consuming swaths of land and leading to the evacuation of residents. Cross-border attacks have spiked this month, but there has been low-intensity fighting since the Hamas attack on Israel on October 7, when militants killed around 1,200 people and abducted 200 others, according to Israeli officials. That prompted Israel to go to war with Hamas in Gaza, during which it has leveled much of the Strip and killed more than 36,000 Palestinians, according to Gazan officials. Hezbollah has said its current round of fighting with Israel is to support the Palestinians in Gaza. Its military capability is believed to be far greater than that of Hamas and has grown since 2006, when it relied largely on inaccurate Soviet-era Katyusha rockets. Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah says his group boasts more than 100,000 fighters and reservists. The group is also believed to possess 150,000 rockets, which could overwhelm Israels defenses if an all-out war broke out. More than 53,000 Israelis have been evacuated from the north since hostilities began in October, the IDF told CNN. In Lebanon, more than 94,000 people have been displaced from the border area, according to the countrys health ministry. Source: CNN --Agencies",

        "date": "June 15, 2024 04:22 pm",
        "content": "Kate, Britains Princess of Wales, made her first public appearance on Saturday since surgery five months ago revealed the presence of cancer. Kate, wearing a pale outfit, rode in a carriage with her three children before the Trooping the Colour, an annual military parade near Buckingham Palace in central London that marks the official birthday of the British monarch, King Charles. Crowds lining the streets waved and cheered as the carriage went past. Charles rode in a separate carriage with Queen Camilla, followed by Prince William, Charles heir and Kates husband, who was on horseback along with other senior members of the royal family. Kate, 42, has undergone preventative chemotherapy since the cancer announcement, and while treatment is continuing, her improved health meant she was able to appear in public for the first time since last December. In a rare personal written message on Friday, she said she was making good progress but was not out of the woods. She said she was looking forward to attending Saturdays parade and hoped to join a few public engagements over the summer. Kate spent two weeks in hospital in January after she underwent major abdominal surgery, and two months later she announced in a video message that tests had revealed the presence of cancer. In her message on Friday, Kate said she had been blown away by thousands of kind messages from across the globe, which had made a world of difference to her and William. I am making good progress, but as anyone going through chemotherapy will know, there are good days and bad days, Kates statement said. Her office, Kensington Palace, has declined to give any details about the type of cancer or about her treatment, other than to say the preventative chemotherapy had begun in February. Her illness has coincided with that of Charles, 75, who has also been undergoing treatment for cancer. He returned to public duties in April, and has remained busy, although his diary commitments are being limited to minimise risks to his recovery. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

Speaking to the media today (15), Siyambalapitiya highlighted ongoing discussions with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which has been guiding the countrys financial strategies. He mentioned that the government has submitted a roadmap to the IMF regarding the relaxation of vehicle import restrictions, recognizing the direct impact of such imports on the countrys foreign reserves. The relaxation of restrictions will begin with vehicles used for public transport, following a specific method outlined in the roadmap, according to the State Minister. The aforesaid committee comprises key stakeholders such as the Department of Trade and Investment Policies of the Ministry of Finance, Department of Motor Traffic, Central Bank of Sri Lanka, representatives from the vehicle import sectors, the Associated Vehicle Assemblers, the Ministry of Industries and the Ministry of Environment in order to develop this program. Siyambalapitiya emphasized that the initial focus will be on easing restrictions on vehicles used for public transportation, goods transportation, and common alternatives like motorcycles and cars used by the general public. Subsequently, there will be a gradual easing of restrictions on luxury vehicle imports, with special consideration given to their economic implications, the State Minister said.",

        "date": "June 15, 2024 07:13 pm",
        "content": "The Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP) of Anuradhapura Sanjeewa Mahanama, who allegedly aided in the orchestrated shooting at the vehicle of former Anuradhapura District parliamentarian Uddika Premaratne, has reportedly fled the country. Investigations have uncovered that the suspected police officer has handed over his official firearm to another person at the airport and left the country. Meanwhile, the Ministry of Public Security states that action will be taken to arrest the relevant suspect as per court orders. The Ministry also mentioned that steps will be taken to record statements from former MP Uddika Premaratne. On Friday (14), Sri Lanka Police said that it was uncovered that the incident where several gunshots had been fired at the vehicle belonging to former Anuradhapura District parliamentarian Uddika Premaratne, had been orchestrated by the actor-turned-politician himself with the assistance of an Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP) in the area. Speaking during a press conference held in Colombo, the Police Media Spokesman DIG Nihal Thalduwa said that the suspects connected to the incident have been identified so far following investigations carried out by the CID. On September 17, 2023, a group of unidentified gunmen had opened fire at Premaratnes car soon after he returned to his residence in Anuradhapura at around 10.35 p.m. The parliamentarian had allegedly managed to escape unharmed. The perpetrators, who had arrived in a car, were said to have targeted the parliamentarian who was walking towards the house after parking his vehicle. The left rear door glass of Premaratnes car was damaged in the shooting incident for which the gunmen were believed to have used a pistol. Anuradhapura police initiated investigations soon after the incident was reported and Special Task Force (STF) personnel were deployed to beef up the security near the MPs house. Later, investigations into the matter were handed over to the Criminal Investigation Department (CID). However, the former MP claimed that the existing system within the country was the reason behind the recent shooting incident targeting him. Speaking in Parliament in this regard, MP Premaratne said that while he believed the political system was the cause behind the recent shooting outside his residence, and tha it is also the reason why the country is in the state it is today. Later on 27 February 2024, the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) MP resigned as a Member of Parliament, following which S.C. Muthukumarana of SLPP was appointed to fill the vacant MP seat. However, Premaratne was later reported to have fled to Canada, seeking political asylum, which he refuted, and claimed that he was expecting a work visa in Canada. In 2020, the popular actor was announced as a candidate for the 2020 parliamentary election from the Anuradhapura District as a member of the Sri Lanka Peoples Freedom Alliance, a political alliance led by the SLPP formed in 2019. He obtained 133,550 votes and won a seat in the 16th Parliament of Sri Lanka.",

The scan uncovered a stock of suspicious parcels in a compartment sealed with fiber in the front section of the boat, the navy said. The suspects had later confessed that a fiber boat builder, who was with them, had hidden the parcels by integrating them into the boats structure and sealing them with fiber. The suspects, who are the residents of Gandara and Devundara, have stated that they embarked on the trip from Devundara on May 15. The journey was planned by the boats skipper and coordinated by an individual infamously known as Aiya, who communicated with them via a satellite phone.

Speaking to the media, Mathews laid blame on the batters that let the team down in both of their matches of the tournament. The Sri Lankan all-rounder further said: We are very sorry that our hopes as a team and the hopes of the country were dashed. We are very sorry. We apologize. We could not achieve what we set out to accomplish as a team. In both matches we played, it was our batsmen who failed. The bowlers and fielders performed very well and, despite the low scores, they put up a strong fight in both games. But unfortunately, we could not secure a win, he expressed. Losing even one match in a tournament like this makes it very difficult to advance. After losing the first two matches, our chances diminished significantly. Additionally, the match against Nepal was interrupted by rain. We have one game left, and we hope to play well and secure a win. Our audience supports us immensely, and we deeply regret that we could not deliver something for them. We have only one thing to say: we are sorry. None of us ever expect to lose a match, we always aim to win. Unfortunately, we couldnt achieve that in this tournament, Mathews added.",

        "date": "June 16, 2024 12:11 pm",
        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe highlighted that the Urumaya program has significantly boosted property values by securing land rights for the people. He emphasized that amidst economic challenges and the COVID-19 pandemic, the Urumaya initiative has played a crucial role in revitalizing property prices, thus contributing to the countrys economic resilience. President Wickremesinghe made these remarks during his presence at a ceremony held at the Mannar Municipal Council Auditorium, where land deeds were distributed to the residents of the Mannar district under the national Urumaya program today (16), aiming to distribute 2 million freehold land deeds. As part of this initiative, 5,000 land deeds are designated for the Mannar district, with 442 deeds ceremonially handed over by the President on this occasion. Additionally, the President distributed cheques intended for the procurement of fertilizer to local farmers in the Mannar district. He also oversaw the allocation of agricultural insurance compensation for crops damaged during adverse weather conditions, along with financial provisions for fishermen in the region to acquire fishing equipment. During the event, Mannar District Secretary Mr. K. Kanakeswaran presented a memento to President Ranil Wickremesinghe in appreciation of his contributions. President Ranil Wickremesinghe further stated: During my visit to the North last month, I made a promise to visit Mannar. We have initiated a development program specifically for Mannar. In the Northern region, approximately 90,000 families are asserting their land rights. Out of these, 45,000 families have clear eligibility for land deeds without any complications. I have instructed the Governor and the Northern Provincial Council to expedite action for the remaining 45,000 families. Since 1935 until now, land in areas from Point Pedro to Dondra Point has only been issued through licenses to various communities. These licenses are subject to revocation at any time and do not provide secure tenure. Despite cultivating the land, farmers have not obtained ownership rights. Some farmers have been working on these lands for 85 years. Across the country, about 2 million families lack proper land rights. The Urumaya initiative has introduced the freehold land title program on their behalf. The general public suffered greatly from the Covid-19 pandemic. As the country emerges from financial hardship, the benefits should reach the people. Particularly, the Urumaya program is once again enhancing the value of peoples property. No other Asian country has implemented such a widespread free land rights initiative, making the Urumaya program revolutionary for our nation. Furthermore, we are actively working to provide homeownership to 250,000 apartment owners in the Western Province. The government is dedicated to supporting those affected by the economic downturn. During the war, people in the North had to abandon their homes, properties, and lands. For the first time, they now have the opportunity to live under secure land rights. I urge everyone to safeguard these land rights that you have acquired. This will pave the way for both personal and national economic advancement. PMD",

        "title": "Govt to introduce imputed rental income tax due to failure to implement property tax?",
        "date": "June 16, 2024 12:36 pm",
        "content": "Wasantha Athukorala, a professor in the Department of Economics and Statistics at the University of Peradeniya, alleges that the government is working to introduce an imputed rental income tax, as the government failed to prepare plans for the implementation of a property tax by April 2025, as proposed by the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Furthermore, Prof. Athukorala expressed that if a property tax is implemented in the country, all ill-gotten gains will be exposed. It was announced that Sri Lanka will likely introduce an imputed rental income tax, as part of the ongoing revenue mobilization efforts. The new tax comes as a substitute for the property tax, as the introduction of the property tax and the gift and inheritance tax by 2025 encountered delays, due to constitutional restrictions on sharing revenues between the central and local authorities and the lack of adequate information on property values. Accordingly, Sri Lanka will promptly initiate preparatory work to introduce an imputed rental income tax, though the expected gains would only fully materialize in 2026. The imputed rental income tax on owner-occupied and vacant residential properties will be introduced before the beginning of the tax year on April 1st, 2025, as per the IMF Country Report No. 24161. To ensure that the imputed rental income tax is fully operational by 2026, Sri Lanka will undertake the following measures; Establish the first database on estimated current market values by end-December 2024 with immediate efforts to (i) digitize the valuation records held by the government valuation department, starting with municipal councils, finalizing this effort by end-2025, (ii) collect information from a representative sample of 5,000 standard properties that includes key variables, including annual values, latest assessment date, and property type, of all properties in all municipal councils by August 2024 (new Structural Benchmark). This would help determine the capital values of these properties. Introduce a provisional nationwide digital Sales Price and Rents Register (SPRR) by August 2024. Ensure that the SPRR is fully established and operational by end-March 2025 and that it is accessible by the IRD, the valuation department, the land registry and the general public (new structural benchmark). A fully operational digital SPRR would be the key resource for the assessment of property values and hence the basis for several taxes, including imputed rental income taxation, capital gains taxation, stamp duties, and local recurrent property taxes. Improve data-sharing among relevant government entities. A gazette notification was introduced on March 21, 2024, under the IRA requiring the Registrar Generals Department to share all real estate sales information with the IRD. The Notaries Act will be amended by April 2025 to ensure comprehensive information on each notarized real property contract (which will include the valuation roll, the cadastral number, and a unique tax ID) is automatically fed into the digital SPRR.",

President Wickremesinghe also mentioned that a pre-feasibility study for a land connection between Sri Lanka and India has been completed, and a full feasibility study will be conducted in the near future. Additionally, plans to develop Mannar as a tourist hub were discussed, including the potential development of Mannar Fort to attract cruise tourists. President Ranil Wickremesinghe further remarked that these initiatives would lead to extensive development across all sectors in the Mannar district in the future. The Bishop of Mannar also urged the President to address the issues faced by the fishermen of Mannar. The meeting was attended by Vicar General of the Mannar Diocese, Father P. Christunayagam; Reverend Father Gnanpragasam of Madu Church; Father Peppi Sosei; former Vicar General of the Mannar Diocese; and other clergy members. -PMD-",

        "title": "King Charles Birthday Honours list unveiled",
        "date": "June 16, 2024 03:56 pm",
        "content": "A former post office branch manager who campaigned to expose a vast miscarriage of justice has been given a knighthood by King Charles III. Alan Bates is among more than 1,000 people, including artist Tracey Emin, actress Imelda Staunton and Duran Duran singer Simon Le Bon, recognized on Friday on the Kings Birthday Honors list, released to mark the British monarchs official birthday. Bates was among thousands of branch managers accused of dishonesty after a faulty accounting system showed money was missing from their shops. About 900 were convicted, some were imprisoned, and many were financially ruined. Bates was stripped of his Post Office branch in 2003 after he repeatedly complained about the Horizon software supplied by Fujitsu. In 2009, he founded the Justice for Subpostmasters Alliance to campaign for the truth and compensation. After years of pressure, the government set up a public inquiry and quashed the convictions. Bates became known to millions when he was played by Toby Jones in television drama Mr. Bates vs the Post Office, broadcast earlier this year. Bates said that while he was the recipient, the honor was on behalf of the group as well  and recognition of the horrendous things that have happened to them. And the storys not over yet. Emin, a leading member of the Young British Artists movement that shook up the 1990s art scene, was made a dame, the female equivalent of a knight. She made her name with self-revealing works such as and Everyone I Have Ever Slept With and My Bed  a mess of disheveled sheets, empty vodka bottles, cigarette butts and discarded condoms. Dame Tracey has a good ring to it, said Emin, whose recent work charts her experience with an aggressive form of bladder cancer. Im very, very happy. Another brilliant surprise in my life. Staunton, who played Queen Elizabeth II in the final two seasons of The Crown, said she was genuinely humbled to be recognized on the same level as the amazing actresses, all the great dames, who have led the way for so many of us. U.S.-born financier Bill Browder, a Kremlin critic who campaigns against corruption and human rights abuses in Russia, received a knighthood. He dedicated the honor to Russian dissidents who made the ultimate sacrifice for their country, including Alexei Navalny and Browders former lawyer Sergei Magnitsky, who died in a Russian prison in 2009 after exposing a tax fraud. Browder successfully lobbied U.S. lawmakers to pass the 2012 Magnitsky Act, which allows for asset freezes and visa bans of human rights violators in Russia. Several other countries have adopted similar legislation. We should do everything we can to support those Russians that are fighting the Putin regime, so that when his regime finally falls we have some good and decent people to run the country, to bring democracy, human rights and freedoms to the Russian people, and to engage with the West in a peaceful way, Browder said. Knighthoods also went to choreographer Wayne McGregor, composer John Rutter and historian Niall Ferguson, while fashion designer Anya Hindmarch was made a dame. Former U.K. Prime Minister Gordon Brown, in office between 2007 and 2010, was made a Companion of Honor, which is limited to 65 people of distinction. In the world of sports, there was a knighthood for cyclist Mark Cavendish; a CBE or Commander of the Order of the British Empire for former Scotland soccer star Graeme Souness; and an MBE  Member of the Order of the British Empire  for sprinter Anita Neil, the first Black woman to compete for Great Britain at an Olympic Games, in 1968. Film and television writer Armando Iannucci, creator of political comedies The Thick of It and Veep, received a CBE, while Le Bon got an MBE for services to music and charity. In descending order, the main honors are knighthoods, CBE, OBE  Officer of the Order of the British Empire  and MBE. Knights are addressed as sir or dame, followed by their name. Recipients of the other honors have no title, but can put the letters after their names. Recipients are selected by committees of civil servants from nominations made by the government and the public, with the awards bestowed by the king or other senior royals during Buckingham Palace ceremonies. The awards are criticized by some over their associations with Britains imperial past, but remain widely coveted as a mark of recognition. Beyond the smattering of celebrities, many recipients are people outside the public eye who have made a contribution to charities or their communities. They include Royal Gurkha Rifles veteran Hari Budha Magar, an MBE recipient who climbed Mount Everest after losing both his legs above the knee in Afghanistan, and Gerald Lobley, who received an MBE for half a century of teaching Scottish youngsters chess.

        "content": "Russian special forces freed two prison guards and shot dead six inmates linked to the Islamic State militant group who had taken them hostage at a detention centre in the southern city of Rostov on Sunday, Russian media said. State media said that some of the men had been convicted of terrorism offences and were accused of affiliation with the Islamic State militant group, which claimed responsibility for a deadly attack on a Moscow concert hall in March. The six hostage takers, one of whom wore a headband with the flag used by the Islamic State that bears an Arabic inscription, knocked out window bars and climbed down several floors by rope before taking the guards hostage with a knife and fire axe. In video published by the 112 Telegram channel, one was shown brandishing a knife beside one of the bound guards in Rostov-on-Don. In negotiations with the authorities, they demanded free passage out of the prison. But Russian special forces decided to storm the prison. Intense automatic gunfire could be heard in footage published on Russian Telegram channels. Video published by the 112 Telegram channel showed the six dead men in pools of blood. The criminals were eliminated, Russias Federal Penitentiary Service said in a statement, which said a special operation had taken place to free the hostages. The employees who were being held hostage were released. They are uninjured, the prison service said. Ambulances were seen entering the complex. Islamic State, a Sunni Muslim militant group, was defeated in Iraq and Syria by a combination of U.S.-led forces, Kurdish fighters, and Russian, Iranian, Syrian soldiers. It splintered into different regional groups that have claimed a number of deadly attacks across the world. Islamic State Khorasan (ISIS-K), named after an old term for the region that included parts of Iran, Turkmenistan and Afghanistan, claimed responsibility for the March attack on the Crocus City Hall outside Moscow in which 145 people died.

        "content": "The Israeli military said on Sunday it would hold daily tactical pauses in military activity along a main road in southern Gaza to allow more aid to flow into the enclave, where international aid organisations have warned of a growing humanitarian crisis. Fighting in the city of Rafah, where Israel is targeting the remaining brigades of the militant Islamist Hamas movement, would continue, the military said. It said military activity would be paused from 0500 GMT until 1600 GMT daily until further notice along the road that leads from the Kerem Shalom Crossing to the Salah al-Din Road and then northwards. Despite growing international pressure for a ceasefire, an agreement to halt the fighting still appears distant, more than eight months since the start of the war in the Palestinian enclave. Iran-backed Hezbollah in Lebanon opened a second front against Israel shortly after Hamas Oct. 7 assault sparked the war in Gaza. Fighting across the Israel-Lebanon border is now threatening to spiral into a wider conflict. Tens of thousands of people have been displaced on both sides of the border. In a further sign that fighting in Gaza could drag on, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahus government said on Sunday it was extending until Aug. 15 the period it would fund hotels and guest houses for residents evacuated from southern Israeli border towns. Hamas led a rampage in southern Israel on Oct. 7 in which 1,200 people were killed and more than 250 taken hostage, according to Israeli tallies. At least 37,296 Palestinians have been killed in Israels military campaign, according to the Gaza health ministry. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "content": "A 41-year-old Sri Lankan man who was illegally residing in Italy has been arrested for attempted murder in Napoli by Italys Carabinieri Police after he allegedly stabbed a fellow countryman multiple times and caused severe injuries, Italian media reported. Il Mattino reports that the Carabinieri of the Centro company intervened on Via Francesco Saverio Correra following a report of an injured person last evening. The victim  a 44-year-old Sri Lankan  was struck multiple times, presumably with a bladed weapon, three of the wounds were large and severe: the base of the neck, chest, and right thigh. He was transferred to the Pellegrini hospital where he is still under observation, the report said. The investigations by the Carabinieri of the operational unit of the company concluded last night, resulting in the arrest of a 41-year-old homeless Sri Lankan who was already known to the authorities and was illegally residing in the country. The detainee, transferred to prison at the disposal of the Neapolitan judicial authority, faces charges of attempted murder. The investigations conducted by the Carabinieri in synergy with the prosecutors office, through the analysis of surveillance systems and the collection of on-site testimonies, allowed the reconstruction of the incident. There would have been a heated argument between the two probably over a disputed woman, and the quarrel would have culminated in the assault, the report said. Source: Il Mattino --Agencies",

        "date": "June 16, 2024 10:23 pm",
        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe announced that pilgrims to Madhu will be provided with all necessary facilities to engage in their pilgrimage activities without any hindrance. Addressing the Mannar District Development Committee meeting held today (16) at the Mannar District Secretariat, he emphasized that it is unfair to arrest and fine pilgrims on their way to sacred sites like Madhu Church and Sri Pada. He instructed that if pilgrims are arrested in the future, the Presidents Office should be informed immediately. During the meeting, the President directed the Sri Lanka Army to clean and develop both sides of the existing Madhu Road for the convenience of the pilgrims visiting Madhu Church. He also coordinated with a representative of the Bishop of Mannar, the Department of Forest Conservation, the Road Development Authority, and the Sri Lanka Police to ensure these tasks are completed before the upcoming annual festival of the church of Our Lady of Madhu. Political representatives and government officials attended the meeting, which focused on the future development plans for the Mannar district. Various issues, including those related to health, education, and irrigation, were presented directly to the President, who worked to provide immediate solutions to many of these problems. The President also addressed the urgent request from the hospital director for a CT scan machine for the Mannar Hospital, promising that this need will be promptly met. President Ranil Wickremesinghe stated that the lost development will be restored to the Mannar district, with the program starting this year. He emphasized the necessity of finding solutions that can be implemented in Sri Lanka to adapt to the changing weather patterns over the next five decades. It is predicted that wet regions will receive more rain while dry regions will experience less rainfall in the next fifty years. The President also stressed the importance of creating a new transformation in the economic, social, educational, and agricultural sectors to align with the evolving global landscape. Further expressing his views, President Wickremesinghe said: After enduring three decades of war, the Mannar district is now rebuilding. This district holds significant potential to boost Sri Lankas economy through extensive development. The tourism, fishing, and renewable energy industries have high potential in Mannar. The district has excellent prospects for wind and solar power generation. Discussions have been held with the Indian Government about producing this energy and selling it to India. The Northern Province, in particular, has a unique capability to generate green energy. Constructing solar panel power plants on lakes and wind power plants can produce substantial energy. Selling this energy to India and other countries can greatly contribute to Sri Lankas economy. Green energy and green hydrogen have the potential to foster a green economy. Funding for the construction of a new court complex in Mannar will be provided. The possibility of opening the road to Mannar through Puttalam will be discussed in the future. Additionally, arrangements are being made to provide a CT scan machine to the Mannar Hospital. A formal program to create modern agriculture has been presented, and I encourage the development committee to meet, discuss, and suggest the necessary facilities for this initiative. A structured plan is needed to protect the lakes in this area and secure water from the Malwatu Oya project. In the next five decades, it is predicted that wet regions will receive more rain while dry regions will experience drought. We must start finding solutions now to address this situation. The road to Madhu Church serves pilgrims, as does the road to Sri Pada for those visiting Sri Pada. It is unfair to arrest and impose a fine of Rs 300,000 on the church. Therefore, representatives from the Diocese of Mannar, Forest Conservation Department, Road Development Authority, Sri Lanka Police, and Army should collaborate to clean and develop this road. These activities will be completed before the annual festival of the church of Our Lady of Madhu. The guard post at the entrance to Mannar city cannot be removed immediately, but discussions with the security forces will be held to take appropriate measures. Necessary development for the Mannar district will be provided, with the foundational work starting this year. I wanted to inform you about the extensive development process happening in Mannar. Lets work together to make Mannar a major contributor to the countrys economy through comprehensive development. Source: PMD",

        "content": "Singapore authorities said on Monday a dredger boat reported a sudden loss in engine and steering control that led it to hit a stationary cargo tanker, causing an oil spill that has blackened part of the city-islands southern shores. The Netherlands-flagged dredger Vox Maxima struck the Singaporean fuel supply ship Marine Honor on Friday. It ruptured one of the cargo tanks on the Marine Honor, which leaked low-sulfur oil into the sea. Although the leak has been contained, tides washed the spilled oil that had been treated with dispersants further along the shoreline, including to the popular resort island of Sentosa. Singapores Maritime and Port Authority, in a joint statement with the National Environment Agency, the National Parks Board and Sentosa Development Corp, said the master and crew members of Vox Maxima are assisting in the ongoing investigations. Part of the beachfront at a public park, beaches at three southern islands and a nature reserve have been closed to facilitate clean-up efforts. Sentosa beaches remain open to the public but sea activities and swimming are prohibited. Oil Spill Response Limited, an industry-funded co-operative that responds to spills, will deploy floating containment and recovery devices to corral the oil on the water surface, where two skimmer craft will then lift the oil into storage tanks, the statement said. Over 250 workers are involved in the clean-up. Just under a mile of containment booms have been set up to trap the oil and another mile of the temporary barriers will be laid over the next few days to prevent further spread of oil onto the shore, the statement said. The National Parks Board also deployed oil-absorbing booms to protect mangroves at another park that have not been affected so far. Members of the public who volunteered to help have been assigned to patrol the park for early signs of oil slicks. Conservationists and biologists are monitoring the full extent of the damage on marine and wildlife. Source: The Associated Press --Agencies",

        "content": "The six fishermen, who were apprehended whole aboard a local multi-day fishing trawler carrying 131kg of heroin in the seas off Galle, have been ordered to be remanded until June 21. The Colombo Chief Magistrate has issued this order after the suspects were produced before the court on Sunday (16). In a recent operation, the Sri Lanka Navy apprehended six suspects aboard a local multi-day fishing trawler carrying 131 kg of heroin, estimated to be valued at over Rs. 3,250 million. The interception took place on June 14 on the high seas off Galle. During the initial inspection, security forces have not found anything suspicious. However, further investigation had revealed several areas of the boat were suspiciously made with fiber. Later on the night of June 14, the vessel was brought to Galle Port, where a detailed scan was conducted. The scan uncovered a stock of suspicious parcels in a compartment sealed with fiber in the front section of the boat, the navy said. The suspects had later confessed that a fiber boat builder, who was with them, had hidden the parcels by integrating them into the boats structure and sealing them with fiber. The suspects, who are residents of Gandara and Devundara, have stated that they embarked on the trip from Devundara on May 15. The journey was planned by the boats skipper and coordinated by an individual known to them only as Aiya, who communicated with them via a satellite phone. The suspects revealed that they had received initial payments between Rs. 20,000 and Rs. 40,000 for their involvement in this activity, according to police.",

        "date": "June 17, 2024 11:18 am",
        "content": "Global concerns about the use of AI in news production and misinformation are growing, a report published by the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism found, posing fresh challenges to newsrooms already struggling to engage audiences. The institutes annual Digital News Report published on Monday, which this year is based on surveys of nearly 100,000 people across 47 countries, offers a picture of the hurdles news media faces in lifting revenue and sustaining business. Newsrooms globally are working to address a new challenge with generative artificial intelligence, as tech giants and startups like Google and OpenAI build tools that can offer summaries of information and siphon traffic from news websites. But the report found that consumers are suspicious about the use of AI to create news content, particularly for sensitive subjects such as politics. According to the survey, 52 of U.S. respondents and 63 of UK respondents said they would be uncomfortable with news produced mostly with AI. The report surveyed 2,000 people in each country, noting that respondents were more comfortable with behind-the-scenes uses of AI to make journalists work more efficient. It was surprising to see the level of suspicion, said Nic Newman, senior research associate at the Reuters Institute and lead author of the Digital News Report. People broadly had fears about what might happen to content reliability and trust. Concerns about false news content online rose by three percentage points from last year, with 59 of survey respondents saying they were worried. This figure was higher in South Africa and the U.S. at 81 and 72, respectively, as both countries hold elections this year, the report said. Another challenge facing news organizations is the general unwillingness of audiences to pay for news subscriptions. Following some growth during the pandemic, 17 of respondents across 20 countries said they paid for online news, a figure that has been unchanged for the past three years, the report said. A significant proportion of news subscribers in the U.S. were also likely to be paying discounted rates due to trials or promotions, with 46 paying less than the full price for their subscriptions. TURNING TO ALTERNATIVES News influencers are playing a bigger role than mainstream media organizations in delivering the news to users of popular online platforms like TikTok. In a survey of more than 5,600 TikTok users who said they used the app for news, 57 said they mostly paid attention to individual personalities, versus 34 who said they mainly followed journalists or news brands. The findings show that newsrooms need to build a direct relationship with their audiences while also strategically using the platforms to connect with people who are trickier to reach, like younger audiences, Newman said. We see that these influencers have a bigger role on the platforms. Vitus V Spehar, a TikTok creator with 3.1 million followers, was one news personality cited by some of the survey respondents. Spehar has become known for their unique style of delivering the top headlines of the day while laying on the floor under their desk, which they previously told Reuters is intended to offer a more gentle perspective on current events and contrast with a traditional news anchor who sits at a desk. The Digital News Report surveyed people in the U.S., UK, France, Argentina and Brazil, asking them to name up to three mainstream or alternative accounts they follow for the news. The top 10 individuals cited by respondents in the U.S. are most known for offering political commentary rather than original newsgathering, the report noted. These personalities included Tucker Carlson, a former Fox News anchor, Joe Rogan, who hosts the top podcast on Spotify and David Pakman, a progressive talk radio host. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

Siyambalapitiya said as a country with a negative economy of less than 12 recorded in the last quarter of 2022, the people who look at this situation with a positive eye will observe the economic journey of Sri Lanka with hope. Furthermore, the State Minister said the overall annual growth in 2024 will be around 2.2, as per the forecasts of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka. It is remarkable that we were able to achieve positive growth two years after facing the worst economic crisis ever, he added. The State Minister noted that the economic program followed by Sri Lanka has been clearly approved by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) which has, however, indicated that the country should proceed with caution. Meanwhile, the construction sector also showed improvement, as inflation came off a peak of 70 in September 2022 to 0.9 in May 2024. Last week, the IMF released USD 336 million as part of a four-year USD 2.9 billion bailout for Sri Lanka, which defaulted on its USD 46 billion foreign debt in April 2022. On Friday (14), the World Banks latest Global Economic Prospects report highlighted that Sri Lankas economy is expected to expand by 2.2 percent in 2024. The report indicates that this is a 0.5-percentage-point upward revision from Januarysupported by modest recoveries in remittances and tourism. Meanwhile, it highlights that in 2025-2026, growth is projected to strengthen further, reaching 3 in 2026, assuming successful debt restructuring negotiations and the implementation of structural reforms, which would offset the adverse impact of planned fiscal consolidation on growth. --With agencies inputs",

        "title": "Finance Ministry issues clarification on proposed imputed rental income tax",
        "date": "June 17, 2024 12:20 pm",
        "content": "Sri Lankas Ministry of Finance, Economic Stabilization and National Policies states that the recent publication of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) supported Extended Fund Facility (EFF) programme related documents make reference to a proposed property tax is to be implemented as an imputed rental income tax. Issuing a clarification on certain speculations and misconceptions regarding the relevant tax, the Finance Ministry said that one of the key reasons for Sri Lankas deep, complex and unprecedented economic crisis is the sharp decline in government tax revenue that led to high budget deficits and resultant escalation of public debt to unsustainable levels. Accordingly, the remedial measures to recover from the crisis have entailed a focused effort to improve the revenue of the government. Revenue based fiscal consolidation has been implemented during the last two years in an attempt to bring Sri Lankas government revenue from a record low 8.3 of GDP in 2022 to 15 of GDP by end 2025, it added. Meanwhile, the statement highlighted that: In the year 2023, tax reforms focused on progressive corporate and personal income tax measures. In 2024, revenue enhancement is supported by Value Added Tax (VAT) reforms, including elimination of most exemptions and rate adjustments. Thus far, the revenue targets for 2023 have been largely met and target for 2024 is on track to reach the required level of 13.5 of GDP by end 2024. Therefore, there remains 1.5 of GDP revenue gains expected in 2025 in order to reach the 15 of GDP revenue target. Furthermore, the Finance Ministry explained that the main revenue measure expected to help achieve the 2025 target is a wealth tax that is focused on property. From the outset of the IMF programme approval in March 2023, the revenue measures expected in 2023, 2024, and 2025 have been clearly presented in the public domain. The envisaged property tax is in an advanced stage of design and therefore, it is premature to outline specific details of rates and thresholds, it mentioned. The Ministry expressed that however, the focus of this tax is on high wealth individuals, and not on average income earners. This objective will be achieved by a suitable tax-free threshold to ensure that the tax is targeted on very high value property or multiple properties that are owned by wealthy members of society, it added. This specific targeting is evidenced by the fact that the tax is expected to yield 0.2 of GDP by 2025 and 0.4 of GDP in a full year in 2026. The design of the tax will also ensure appropriate set off mechanisms to avoid double taxation and any elements that distort economic incentives, as per the statement issued by the ministry. Moreover, the statement pointed out that the property taxes are implemented in many countries including developing countries like India since they are considered to be a highly efficient, progressive, and non-distortive means of generating revenue to fund public services. The tax is expected to go through the regular legal process of amendments to the required legislation and is expected to come into force in April 2025. In addition to completing the legislative process, there is significant administrative work required to be done in terms of improving valuation mechanisms and databases in order to implement this proposed tax measure that was first announced in March 2023 with the publication of IMF programme documents. In fact, that is not a new tax measure. The Inland Revenue Act No. 10 of 2006 included a similar imputed income calculation termed Net Annual Value, it added. The Ministry also stated that the property in Sri Lanka is also subject to existing taxes such as local authority Rates and Stamp Duty  therefore, there is significant precedence for such a property tax. The continued improvement of government revenue and associated reduction in budget deficits has supported the governments efforts to restore economic stability, and has helped bring down interest rates and support appreciation of the currency, which brings with it material improvements to all citizens, it said. Additionally, the Finance Ministry stated that a failure to reach the required level of government tax revenue that can fund public expenditure would lead to a recurrence of the economic crisis that had devastating impacts on the entire country.",

        "date": "June 17, 2024 12:35 pm",
        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe stated that through the Urumaya program, the governments intent is to express gratitude to farmers who have supplied rice to the country despite not owning the land. He also emphasized that the current government aims to provide both knowledge and rights to the people, akin to how C.W.W. Kannangara promoted education through free schooling. President Wickremesinghe made these remarks at a ceremony held this morning (17) at the Embilipitiya Mahaweli Stadium. The event was for the awarding of freehold land deeds to 1,524 out of 45,253 eligible settlers in the Mahaweli Walawa region as part of the national Urumaya program to provide 02 million freehold land deeds. The President participated in the Urumaya ceremony and the symbolic distribution of land deeds. Addressing the event, President Wickremesinghe further stated, I have instructed all relevant authorities to issue freehold land deeds within the next two months. District Secretaries, the Land Commissioner General, and the surveyors office will collaborate to expedite the delivery of these land deeds. Local government officials will also contribute, ensuring the efficient implementation of this program. For the past 75 years, people have been given land without freehold rights. The Urumaya program was introduced to grant these legal land rights, marking a significant change. During difficult times, everyone shared the burden. Now that the economy is improving, everyone should benefit, especially the farmers who provide rice to the nation. In addition to granting free land rights to farmers, we are working to provide housing rights to 250,000 low-income residents living in the Colombo flats. This program aims to ensure that every citizen owns land, a house, or a vehicle. Just as C.W.W. Kannangara provided free education in 1944, this government is committed to providing both knowledge and rights to the people. Farmers in this area have been growing crops and harvesting without owning the land, preventing them from obtaining bank loans. This problem has persisted for three generations. To address this, the government implemented the Urumaya program to grant them land rights as a gesture of gratitude to the farmers of this country. When we assumed office, the country was in crisis, with no electricity, and a lack of fuel and medicines. To recover, we prioritized increasing production. Paddy production rose during the 2022 and 2023 seasons, thanks to the farmers efforts. The government provided necessary support, including fertilizer. Our support for farmers goes beyond land ownership. To eliminate rural poverty, we must carry out an agricultural revolution. The agricultural modernization program is designed to increase farmers incomes alongside land ownership. We urge everyone to participate in this program, which will begin next year with prompt funding. The government also plans to modernize and restructure the agricultural service centers. I extend my gratitude to the farmers of this area for their service over three generations without land rights. Minister of Wildlife,Forest Resources Conservation and Irrigation, Pavithra Wanniarachchi, Today marks the historic achievement of receiving land rights after generations of deprivation. The suffering endured without these rights has been immense. Today, the President has taken decisive steps to fulfill the fundamental needs of our people: land, housing, and food. The joy experienced by families through owning freehold land is invaluable. This initiative, led by the President, is seen as a transformative revolution aimed at empowering and bringing immense joy to your families. A significant revolution is underway as 02 million families are granted freehold deeds, providing them with long-awaited land rights. In addition, the President aims to launch the agricultural modernization program. Equipping farmers with modern technology cannot be achieved alone, which is why the initiative to provide modern agricultural equipment has begun with support from the Asian Development Bank. Development initiatives in schools, hospitals, and infrastructure across the country are progressing steadily. Today, under the Presidents astute leadership, the nation has achieved remarkable development. We cannot afford further experimentation; therefore, your support is crucial for sustaining this program. Minister of Agriculture and Plantation Industries Mahinda Amaraweera, There was a time in our country when disputes over land led to tragic conflicts, even within families. Land issues remain a significant cause of police complaints and public grievances that we, as public representatives, frequently encounter. Today, you have received a freehold title deed, marking President Ranil Wickremesinghes largest privatization effort. He is committed to allocating millions of acres of land to the people. Despite the country facing immense challenges, the President stepped up to lead, yet some criticize instead of offering support. Under his leadership, farmers protesting were returned to their fields, ensuring our nations rice needs were met locally, not imported. State Minister of Plantation Industries and Mahaweli Development Lohan Ratwatte, The Mahaweli Authority oversees a significant portion of the countrys land, and under President Ranil Wickremesinghes vision, numerous families have received freehold land deeds through the Urumaya program. President Wickremesinghe has steered the country with a well-structured program, rescuing it from dire circumstances. As various candidates vie for the presidency and social media buzzes with campaigns, it is crucial that the Presidents initiatives continue for another five years. It is imperative for all of us to prioritize the nations interests and collaborate towards its progress. Failure to do so risks plunging the country into turmoil once more. The event was attended by the Maha Sangha of the province, former Speaker Chamal Rajapaksa, Deputy Speaker Ajith Rajapaksa, State Ministers Janaka Wakkambura, Shashindra Rajapaksa, Jagath Pushpakumara, Lohan Ratwatte, Sabaragamuwa Provincial Council Chairman Kanchana Jayaratne, Secretary to the Ministry of Irrigation Saman Darshana Padikorala, Mahaweli Authority Director General M.

        "date": "June 17, 2024 01:36 pm",
        "content": "A freight train smashed into the rear of a stationary passenger train in Indias West Bengal state on Monday, killing at least 15 people and injuring dozens, police said, in an accident that railway authorities blamed on a disregarded signal. Media showed images of the pile-up, with containers from the goods train strewn nearby, and one carriage left nearly vertical after the accident, which comes just over a year after a signalling error caused one of Indias worst rail crashes. At least 15 bodies have been pulled from the mangled carriages, Abhishek Roy, a senior police official in the eastern states district of Darjeeling, the site of the accident, told Reuters. Nearly 30 people were injured and rescue teams from the police and national disaster response force were working with doctors and residents of the area to clear debris from the derailed carriages, Roy added. The goods train hit the Kanchanjunga Express travelling to Kolkata, the capital of West Bengal, from the northeastern state of Tripura, driving three carriages of the passenger train off the rails. It was not immediately clear how many passengers were on board at the time. Rescuers used iron rods and ropes to work free one carriage of the passenger train that had been swept upwards to lodge on the roof of the freight train by the impact of the collision. The dead included the driver of the freight train and a guard on the passenger train, Jaya Varma Sinha, the head of the railway board that runs the countrywide network, told reporters. The accident happened after the driver of the freight train disregarded a signal and hit the rear end of the express train, Sinha added. Rescue work has been completed, Sinha said, while authorities were working to restore traffic, although the damage had been less extensive than initially feared. The guards compartment in the passenger train was badly damaged, he added. There were two parcel vans attached ahead of it which reduced the extent of damage to passengers. Nearby residents heard a loud crash and saw the pile-up upon going to investigate, several told the ANI news agency, in which Reuters has a minority stake. Prime Minister Narendra Modi offered condolences on the loss of life in the accident and said Railway Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw was on his way to the site. About 288 people died a year ago in the neighbouring state of Odisha, in Indias worst rail crash in more than two decades, caused by a signal failure.

Speaking to the media following their final match in the tournament, Hasaranga stated that although it is easy to blame the pitch or other factors after losing matches, players should adapt them as professional cricketers. At first I should say that we are really sorry for our performance. As a team, we know the capabilities of our team, but unfortunately, we did not perform well in the first two matches. Though we won this match, it is too late to change the outcome now, he expressed. The Sri Lankan skipper further said: We talked about our mistakes from both the last World Cup and this tournament, but we havent corrected the mistakes yet. After losing matches, we can blame the pitch and many other factors. I think it is not a good thing to do as professional cricketers. The opposing team plays on the same pitch, so we should not use it as an excuse. We should adapt. As the captain, I, along with the team, accept full responsibility for this defeat, he added.",

        "content": "Harry Potter star Daniel Radcliffe has picked up his first ever Tony Award at Sundays ceremony in New York. Radcliffe won the award for best actor in a musical for his role in the revival of Stephan Sondheims Merrily We Roll Along. The play picked up a further three awards at the event which celebrates the best of theatre on Broadway. In his acceptance speech, the 34-year-old wished his father a happy Fathers day and thanked his girlfriend Erin Darke. My love Erin, you and our son are the best thing that has ever happened to me. I love you so much, thank you so much, he said. He also thanked his parents for playing Sondheim in the car and said the play was one of the best experiences of my life. Jonathan Groff also won his first Tony for his performance in the musical. He praised his co-stars, Radcliffe and Lindsay Mendez and called them more than old friends. You are soulmates, and Im looking forward to watching each other change for the rest of our lives, he said.

The 49-year-old actress was joined on stage by her daughter Vivienne, 15. Director Danya Taymor named actress Jolie among the great women who have lifted me up in her acceptance speech. The production later won the coveted best musical gong, which saw Jolie appear on stage. The play is based on SE Hintons book and follows the conflict between two rival gangs of white Americans divided by their socioeconomic status. It beat musical rival Hells Kitchen, a semi-autobiographical account of Alicia Keys which received 13 nominations and won two. One of those wins was for theatre veteran Kecia Lewis for featured actress. In an emotional on-stage speech, Lewis said: 40 years ago yesterday I walked into the Imperial Theatre to begin my Broadway career at 18 years old. I have had so many amazing experiences and some heartbreaking ones, too. I took a short break from showbusiness and raised a son as a single parent while trying to build a career. This moment is the one I dreamed for most of those 40 years, so I say to everyone who can hear my voice - dont give up. Keys and Jay-Z joined the cast of the musical for a performance of their 2009 hit song Empire State Of Mind in tribute to New York. The most nominated play in Tony history with 13 nods, Stereophonic won five awards including best play.

Another first time winner was Sarah Paulson who won best actress in a lead role and beat Rachel McAdams and Jessica Lange. Paulson won an award for the revival of darkly comic drama Appropriate which follows a dysfunctional family battling over their recently deceased fathers inheritance. The 49-year-old Ratched actress is now halfway to EGOT status - she won an Emmy in 2016 for her role in The People v. O. J. Simpson: American Crime Story. US star Nicole Scherzinger, who recently triumphed at the Olivier awards for her role in Sunset Boulevard, performed during the in-memoriam to theatre stars who have died.

        "date": "June 17, 2024 04:03 pm",
        "content": "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu dissolved the influential War Cabinet tasked with steering the war in Gaza, Israeli officials said Monday, a move that comes days after a key member of the body bolted the government over frustrations surrounding the Israeli leaders handling of the war. The move was widely expected following Benny Gantzs departure earlier this month, which he said came after mounting frustrations over Netanyahus handling of the war. Gantzs absence makes Netanyahu more dependent on his ultranationalist allies to govern and the dissolution of the War Cabinet underlines that shift is underway as Israel continues its eight-month-long war in Gaza. The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the change with the media, said that going forward Netanyahu would hold smaller forums with some of his government members for sensitive issues surrounding the war. That includes his security Cabinet, where far-right governing partners who oppose cease-fire deals and have voiced support for reoccupying Gaza, are members. The War Cabinet was formed in the early days of the war, when Gantz, a centrist opposition party leader, joined the coalition in a show of unity following the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on southern Israel. He had demanded that a small decision-making body steer the war, in a bid to sideline far-right members of Netanyahus government. It was made up of three members  Gantz, Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant  and together they made important decisions throughout the course of the war. Gantzs departure, while not posing a direct threat to Netanyahus rule, rocked Israeli politics at a sensitive time. The popular former military chief was seen as a statesman who boosted Israels credibility with its international partners at a time when Israel finds itself at its most isolated. Netanyahus government is Israels most religious and right-wing ever. In Israels fractious parliamentary system, Netanyahu relies on a group of small parties to help keep his government afloat and without the support of Gantzs party, Netanyahu could be more beholden to the far-right allies who have repeatedly pledged to toppled the government if their demands are not met. Critics say Netanyahus wartime decision-making has been influenced by the ultranationalists in his government. Netanyahu denies the accusations and says he has the countrys best interests in mind.

He went on to say that there is an ongoing national conspiracy aimed at destroying the SLFP, and that he appointed Dr. Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe as the Acting Chairman of the party as there was no other person qualified to hold the position within the SLFP. Speaking to the media in Galle, Sirisena said: If I did not resign from my post in the backdrop where a former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga filed a court case against me resulting in restraining orders, none of these organizers are able to contest in the election as the election commission does not accept such candidates. This is why I resigned. When Dr. Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe assumed the post as the Acting Chairman of the party, there were numerous allegations. Such allegations include statements that I obtained Rs. 170 million, I sold the party due to being unable to secure funds for my court cases, he added. I appointed him as the acting chairman after my resignation as there is no other suitable person to hold the chairmanship of the party. If I reveal their past, they would have to run away. They are attempting to hold the chairmanship without any shame of their doings, Sirisena added. Meanwhile, speaking to the media in Anuradhapura today (17), Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe confirmed that he will be the presidential candidate representing the SLFP. In response to a question raised by a journalist in this regard, Wijeyadasa said: Not as a party, we have formed an alliance. They have decided to appoint me, representing the SLFP and the alliance and I am ready to face it accordingly.",

Within the scope of our ministry, 59 legal reforms have been passed in Parliament: 29 in 2022, 17 in 2023, and 13 so far in 2024. Additionally, seven more drafts are set to be adopted by Parliament soon. It is also important to note that work on 44 other crucial legal amendments is nearly complete. The Ministry of Justice plays a major role in drafting laws for every ministry. Consequently, the Department of Legal Draftsman prepared 273 draft laws in 2022 and 299 in 2023, in all three languages, for other ministries. By making the judicial system more efficient, peoples cases can be resolved quickly. This allows property related to litigation to be utilized for economic development and fosters a favourable investment environment. Clearly, there is a direct relationship between delays in the legal system and economic growth. According to the report issued by the Sectorial Oversight Committee on Legal Affairs in 2017, it typically takes about 17 years to conclude a criminal case. Various studies indicate that it can take more than a generation to complete land, partition, and testamentary cases. We have planned the necessary activities to change this situation. Digitization of the judicial system has been identified as a major solution. Accordingly, digitization and a large number of reforms have already been carried out in the ministry as well as in the judicial sector. After 42 years, the amendment of the Constitution increased the number of Supreme Court judges by 14. Despite the difficult economic situation, 76 judicial officers were recruited on two occasions in the last two years. Additionally, 34 individuals were promoted to High Court Judges on two occasions. This allowed for the increase in the number of courts and the introduction of new courts. During this period, the number of courtrooms in the Supreme Court was increased from 3 to 5, and the number of courtrooms in the Court of Appeal was increased from 5 to 10. It should also be mentioned that digitization has been introduced in the Supreme Court, providing great convenience to citizens, including lawyers. Getting to the top of the Ease of Doing Business Index is crucial for attracting foreign investments. Four Commercial High Courts have been established in the Western Province to resolve commercial disputes, and all arrangements have been made to establish more Commercial High Courts. Additionally, to address the new investment landscape created by the port city project, necessary legal reforms are underway to establish an investment court to quickly resolve investor disputes. An Enforcing Contract Task Force is also being implemented to build a favourable investment environment. The amendment to the Code of Civil Procedure in 2023 introduced the pre-trial conference system, enabling quicker trials. In the future, pre-trial hearings are also planned to be conducted swiftly under separate judges. It should be noted that nearly 30 of the cases piled up in the district courts are money-related cases. To reduce the number of financial cases coming to the courts, the financial limit of the conciliation boards was raised to Rs. 1 million. In 2022, the Ministry introduced a significant change to the judicial structure by establishing small claims courts, where financial disputes up to Rs. 2 million can be referred. Since these courts follow streamlined procedures, financial disputes can be resolved very quickly. Currently, separate Small Claims Courts are functioning in Colombo, Kandy, and Matale. In the future, the establishment of these small claims courts in other areas will be facilitated. Until then, this judicial procedure will be implemented in the district courts. The Judicial Zoning Committee has proposed many new courts to facilitate access to justice for rural people. Accordingly, a tourism court was established in the Morawewa area, and the other recommendations of the committees report will be implemented in the future. Tourist courts and magistrate courts were promoted in Medavachchiya, Kahtagasdigiliya, Nochchiyagama, Kalavanchikudi, Narammala and Kalawana. Additionally, several new courts were established over the past two years. Moreover, the process of settling disputes outside of court has been strengthened. It is noteworthy that Sri Lankas dispute settlement rate is almost 70, which has received international recognition. We have taken necessary steps to strengthen the institutions under the Ministry of Justice, including the Attorney Generals Department, the Department of Legal Draftsman, the Department of Government Analyst, and the National Authority for The Protection of Victims of Crimes and Witnesses, to ensure the effective administration of justice for the public. In 2023 alone, the Sri Lanka Legal Aid Commission provided services to 182,579 people. The Office of National Unity and Reconciliation, the Office of Missing Persons and the Office of Reparations are working towards creating a Sri Lankan nation that respects national identity, treats every citizen equally and upholds peace. The Ministry will implement the necessary legal amendments and provide all required guidelines. Additional Secretary (Legal) Ms. Piyumanthi Peiris, The past two years have been characterized by numerous legislative actions, including the enactment of new laws and updates to existing ones. In the 21st amendment to the constitution, we uphold the positive aspects of the 20th amendment. Notably, through the 21st amendment, all independent commissions were reinstated, addressing previous challenges effectively. This includes provisions for prosecuting the wrongdoings made by the President, requiring Parliamentary approval for high government positions and seeking Constitution Councils approval for appointing the Governor of the Central Bank. Additionally, significant bills such as the Anti-Corruption Bill and the Hydrology Bill have been introduced. As per the amendment to the Dangerous Drugs Ordinance, possession of more than 5 grams of ICE drug carries severe penalties, including death or life imprisonment. Furthermore, the recently enacted Regulation of Election Expenditure Bill mandates that every candidate contesting elections must report their expenditures within 21 days of the release of election results, marking a significant positive development. Moreover, in the Commercial High Court, the option to conduct proceedings entirely in English has been introduced. Additionally, online hearings are currently underway and a new arbitration law has been submitted to the Attorney General for approval, aiming to resolve cases outside of traditional court settings. In conclusion, these new decrees and measures are expected to facilitate expedient and systematic conclusion of legal proceedings. Additional Secretary (Legal Reforms) Ms. Krishanthi Meegahapola, We are actively working on introducing Court Community Platform software that will connect all institutions involved in the judicial sector. Currently, we are implementing recommendations from the Judicial Service Commission with additional technical support. The digitization of all courts in Sri Lanka is planned in three phases, with financial support from the European Union and technical assistance from the United Nations Development Program. Pilot projects for this initiative are already underway. Additionally, the process of applying for bail and providing bail has been streamlined through an electronic system. Furthermore, digital display boards have been installed in several courts in Colombo to manage the crowd in courtrooms effectively. An electronic payment system has also been introduced, with plans to transition to an online payment system in the next stage. Additional Secretary (Engineering) Ms. S. A. K. Subasinghe, In the fiscal year 2022, our ministry was allocated Rs. 4862 million, followed by Rs. 2748 million in 2023 and Rs. 2743 million in 2024. With these allocations, we have successfully opened three court complexes in Ratnapura, Welimada and Theldeniya. Last year, a double apartment complex was constructed in Kurunegala. Additionally, renovation work has modernized the Judicial Service Commission building. Construction is underway for the Galle Court Complex, with plans to complete the first phase of a 16-floor Colombo 12 Court Complex spanning six floors. Efforts are also on-going to modernize the Supreme Court complex and the Court of Appeal. A new court building is being constructed in Wakarei. Furthermore, quarters for judges are being built in Gampola, Halawatha and Batticaloa. Government Analyst Ms. D. Seneviratne, If we measure the progress of our department by the number of reports issued, the figures for the years 2022, 2023 and 2024 indicate significant growth. In 2022, we received 42,895 productions and issued 40,756 reports. By 2023, these numbers increased to 58,886 productions received and 53,253 reports issued. This represents a 37 increase in production receipts and a 30 increase in report issuances compared to 2022. Commissioner General of Prisons Mr. H.M.T.N Upuldeniya, The prison reform process has indeed been successful over the past two years. Various long-term and short-term measures have been implemented to address overcrowding in prisons. Plans are underway to complete the relocation of Dumbara, Jaffna and Angunakolapalassa prisons within the next two years. Additionally, preliminary work for the evacuation of the Colombo prison has already been completed. Director General of the Office for Reparation Ms. J. Krishnamoorthy, The Office for Reparations operates according to seven thematic principles to support citizens. Financial relief continues to be disbursed for movable and immovable properties, as well as vehicles, to those affected by the unrest in 2022. By December 2023, financial relief had been provided for 26,538 complaints. Additional Secretary (Development) Ms. R. P. S. Saman Kumari, Deputy Director (Legal) of the Legal Aid Commission Advocate Ms. S. M. K. Hapuarachchi, Secretary of the Conciliation Board Commission Ms. T. K. Rathnasuriya, Acting Director General of the Office for National Unity and Reconciliation Ms. Thushari Suriyarachchi, Head of Data Management of the Office of Missing Persons Mr. A. N. Nuwan also addressed the press conference and many officials from the Ministry of Justice, Prison Affairs and Constitutional Reform were present on the occasion. Source: PMD",

        "title": "Eleven migrants dead, 64 missing after Mediterranean shipwrecks",
        "date": "June 17, 2024 10:23 pm",
        "content": "(Reuters) - Eleven migrants died and 64 were missing on Monday after two shipwrecks off southern Italy, according to a German charity, the Italian coast guard and United Nations agencies. The German aid group RESQSHIP, which operates the Nadir rescue ship, said it picked up 51 people from a sinking wooden boat, including two who were unconscious, and found 10 bodies trapped in the lower deck of the vessel. Our thoughts are with their families. We are angry and sad, it wrote on X. RESQSHIP said the survivors were handed over to the Italian coast guard and taken ashore on Monday morning, while the Nadir was making its way to the island of Lampedusa, towing the wooden boat with the bodies of the deceased. The U.N. Refugee agency UNHCR, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) and U.N. childrens agency UNICEF said in a joint statement that the migrants intercepted by the German charity came from Syria, Egypt, Pakistan and Bangladesh. The second shipwreck took place about 200 km (125 miles) east of the Italian region of Calabria, as a boat that had set off from Turkey eight days earlier caught fire and overturned, the U.N. agencies said. They said 64 people were missing at sea, while 11 were rescued and taken ashore to the Calabrian town of Roccella Ionica by the Italian coast guard, along with the body of a woman. The coast guard earlier said it was looking for an unspecified number of missing migrants, with the help of the EU border agency Frontex. The migrants vessel, a sailing boat found partially sunk, was first spotted by a French boat in international waters where Italian and Greek search and rescue zones overlap, the coast guard said. The U.N. agencies said the migrants involved in the second shipwreck came from Iran, Syria and Iraq. They again called on EU governments to step up Mediterranean search and rescue efforts and expand legal and safe migration channels, so that migrants are not forced to risk their lives at sea. According to the IOM, more than 23,500 migrants, including 749 in the year to date, have died or gone missing in the central Mediterranean since 2014, making it one the worlds most dangerous migration routes. Earlier this month 11 bodies were recovered from the sea off the coast of Libya. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

The water supply in these areas was interrupted due to damage to the transmission pipeline from the Kalatuwawa Treatment Plant. The NWSDB states that due to this, the water supply to a number of areas in the Colombo District was disrupted and as the damaged pipeline has been repaired, the water supply was restored by around 2.00 a.m. today (18). Accordingly, the water board said that water supply to some remote areas will be restored in the next few hours. The disruption followed a car accident on Monday morning, which caused the vehicle to veer off the road and collide with the pipeline near Godagama, close to the High-Level Road. As a result of the incident, the water supply to over 100,000 housing units in the affected areas was interrupted.",

        "date": "June 18, 2024 10:52 am",
        "content": "Delivering a special statement to Parliament today (18), President Ranil Wickremesinghe said that the proposed Imputed Rental Income Tax will exempt a persons first property. He emphasized that this tax is aimed at high net-income earners, not ordinary income earners, assuring that it will not affect those earning normal income. Raising a Point of Order under the Parliamentary Standing Orders, President Wickremesinghe further called for the appointment of a parliamentary select committee to review the Supreme Courts decision on the Gender Equality Bill. He described the decision as perverse, noting that it challenges the rights of women and the protection of Buddhism. President Ranil Wickremesinghe further stated: Honourable Speaker, you have read out the decision on the Gender Equality Bill. The determination of the Supreme Court on the Gender Equality Bill? Thats right. It has been read out by you. I just want to raise the point of order that it violates the powers of this House under Article 4 of the Constitution and we should appoint a select committee. I would like to say first and foremost the bill says, what is the national policy on gender equality and empowerment of women referred to in this bill. At the least its hard to find out. Its not specific as there is no reference in the bill. There has been a national policy on womens empowerment and gender equality since 2011. These are obligations of the Government under the Sustainable Development Goals 5 and a number of womens conventions and agreements that we have signed. More than that, in the case of the Kamalawathi and other vs the Provincial Public Service Commission, SLR 1, the national policy was deemed within the domain of the Cabinet of Ministers and passed by the Supreme Court. Its a parliament. Its a political matter. The Supreme Court cannot in any way go and make any ruling on this. Then they are contravening and coming into our area. Secondly, theres a large number of cases which have been given on the question of equality and equality of women. There are Ratnayaka Taranga, Lakmali versus Niroshan Abeykoon and the Inspector General of Police. It recognizes the dignity and well-being of people as a fundamental right. Then there are the ten-judge bench in Sarath Jayasinghe and others. We have the view that mere reliance on the text used in a constitution is not sufficient to ascertain the values that are embodied in a constitution or its amendments. Similarly, you have the case where Shirani Bandaranayakes judgment in Karunathilaka and Jayalath de Silva and others, which says the basic principle governing the concept of equality is to remove unfairness and. It is profoundly forbidding action which denies equality and thereby discriminates. And finally, they have also ignored the special determination on the Penal Code Amendment, made by the Chief Justice. In this, we are talking of empowering women and ensuring equality for women. But according to the Goal 5 of Sustainable Development, even other minorities must get the government services without discrimination. That anyway follows from the average duties which have been given to us under fundamental rights. So all these powers have been disregarded. In a sense, the court has set aside everything and saying that this makes room. So in a way, what they have done is all these have disappeared, as if this court has eaten it up, all the other judgments. So in a way, they are practicing judicial cannibalism and we are being asked then to accept it, which this house cant. How can you overrule a ten-judge bench and how can you overrule the Chief Justice? So that is one area. Then they are saying that this will allow same-sex marriages and gender this thing. No, it has nothing to do with it. We cant allow that. They are going on this normal section which is put in every law by the legal draftsman and the AG, not by us. This law prevails over other laws, but this has also been interpreted. Its finally for the court to decide. And I think in Chamara Sampath, not our Honorable Minister, but another person, and Neil Iddawela, they also referred to the points. This has been done by the doctrine of harmonious constructions. And the laws of marriage in this country cant be changed by one section. More than that, they say that the whole of the, basically the whole Pirivena Education Act, can get knocked out by this. I dont know on what basis they have done. We have Article 9 which protects Buddhism. And I know this Act because I have one of those who drafted it, and the Minister who implemented it. This has been defended by, this has been taken on by Article 9. And this, you think a small provision can change it? I dont think the Supreme Court or the bench that sat, is even aware of what is Pariyatti, Patipatti, Pativeda. I think they should go to the temple and learn what this is. Or to a Peruvian before coming and telling this house, we are aware of what is happening there. We have honourable member of the Sangha also. So these rights of what he is saying is that all the rights of the Buddhists can be taken away by one small section. And what is going to happen? All the protection for Buddhism has been removed. And the power of this Supreme Court finally has to go back to the 1972 Constitution, all of us. Any inherent powers all must be, must be justified by the Constituent Assembly and the 72 Constitution which this is built. Therefore, when it comes, the Supreme Court cant rule on a bill. They can only advise us on the value. It is basically a pre-legislative scrutiny. And what we did in the 78 Constitution as one of those involved in this house, was that there had been, we transferred the powers of the Constitutional Court to the Supreme Court to ensure independence of the court is even further strengthened. Thats all that we have done. But otherwise in 72, when the first instance came up and T.S. Fernando decided that the two weeks was not mandatory, the house overlooked it and ruled it out. I think honorable, the former President and Vasudeva Nanayakkara were members of the house. Because these powers of the Supreme Court in all other matters come under justice, but this comes under subordination. Certainly this comes from the Parliament. In a sense, unlike the other courts, the Supreme Court is transgender. So that is what they fall into. They get from two genders, both from us and under Article 4C and from us under Article 4A. So this is really a perverse determination which this house should not follow. And I am going to recommend that a select committee be appointed to go into it. There is no need to summon the judges. I dont think we should go into that. There are enough that can be studied and they can recommend it. Because the majority of the members should be appointed by the Womens Caucus. After all, this concerns women. But what happens is it deprives the majority of this population, the women, of their rights. And it takes away the safeguard of another majority, the Buddhists in the Constitution. So we cannot accept it. And this house then has to assert its own rights. Secondly, honourable speaker, there is a matter on which I have to make an announcement. You know, there has been a lot of discussion and heartburn about the burials and what took place during COVID-19. You know, I was also there. Initially, all countries sort of stopped burials. And then it went to the WHO. But in Sri Lanka, we appointed a committee. And unfortunately, that committee recommended that we dont allow burial. While WHO took a different view. But then the Supreme Court also upheld the decision of the committee. So the government had to follow that. There was no choice at that stage. But now all this is over. And as weve gone through everything, this country any person should have the right to determine whether he is buried or cremated. He or she is buried, cremated, or given to the medical faculty. Therefore, the minister will bring a law which allows the right of burial, right of cremation, or gifting your body to the medical institutions. During this time, there was a lot of pain witnessed only mainly by the Muslims. But there are also Hindus, Buddhists, I know, and Christians who also like to be buried. So they were, wed like to apologize to them on what has happened. And I hope this House will release, will support the bill that will be presented in the House. Thirdly, is that we are taking up the finance issues. And since I may not be here at that time, I just want to tell the House in regard to the rental income, we are going to have a wealth tax. And there will be a very high threshold. So 90 odd percent of the peoples houses will be exempt from this. So dont worry, your house is safe. But why is it we are going to rental income? This was based on rating. Then we came up with a problem. Rates belong to the provincial council. So if you go on the rating list, theres a possibility that the court can say that this money belongs to the provincial council. So we want to get it here. So we have used a different formula called rental income. Your income tax belongs to the central government. Its the same. You generally have used the ratings. But to get over the constitutional issue that we have done this. But its going to have a very high threshold. And I dont think the vast majority of the people in this country should even be worried about their house. So thats all. But we will have to get on to wealth tax. I know SJB is very, very worried that the billionaires who are with them will get taxed. But nevertheless, this is the reason for it. The sovereignty of the people must be upheld, and this sovereignty resides with the Parliament and the President. Currently, both institutions are here. The Judiciary derives its power through the Parliament, a principle established in the 1971 election. In the Queen Vs Liyanage case, it was declared that these powers belong to the Supreme Court. This sparked significant debate, with the United National Party asserting that a 23 vote could change this, while the Sri Lanka Freedom Party disagreed. However, by 1970, the necessary 23 majority was obtained, and it was collectively agreed that this power originates from the constitution crafted by the Constituent Assembly, reflecting the peoples sovereignty, which remains unchanged. In the 1978 Constitution, we introduced a referendum amendment to further safeguard peoples sovereignty and bolster the judiciarys independence. The court has not overstepped its powers; the laws of this country are passed by Parliament and cannot be contested. The courts role is merely advisory on constitutional matters. We established a constitutional court, similar to systems in New Zealand and Finland, where a Parliamentary Select Committee determines the constitutionality of laws. Later in 1978, we decided that a separate court for this purpose was unnecessary and would only incur additional costs. Instead, we empowered the Supreme Court on behalf of Parliament. It is crucial to remember that the Cabinet cannot overturn a courts decision. While various opinions and objections arose, a committee made a decision, which the court subsequently upheld. Blaming the government after such judicial confirmation is futile. I am not here to dwell on the past or to discuss previous controversies, such as those involving Minister Rishad Bathiudeen. Lets leave those behind and focus on our current discussion, avoiding any form of extremism. Source: PMD",

        "date": "June 18, 2024 12:03 pm",
        "content": "A new airline for dogs is getting a major route upgrade. BARK Air, which took to the skies on May 23, recently expanded to new destinations both in the United States and around the world. Dogs, and their owners, will be able to fly to Paris, Chicago, San Jose, Phoenix, and Fort Lauderdale on new service that begins in October. These new routes will complement the existing service connecting New York, Los Angeles, and London. Weve had such high demand, that were expanding service to five new destinations and seven new routes both domestically and internationally, a BARK Air spokesperson shared in a statement to Travel  Leisure. BARK Air operates on Gulfstream G5 jets, and the airline says that each plane can accommodate 14 dogs and humans, however the airline will never sell more than 9 tickets to keep things spacious. Passengers fly in and out of metro areas of major cities, but not necessarily the city itself. For example, flights marketed out of New York operate from Westchester County Airport, and flights to San Francisco actually operate from San Jose airport. Upon landing, the airline provides free ground transportation within a 30 mile radius around the metropolitan area. Domestic routes start at 6,000 and the international routes start at 8,000, with the New York to Paris journey totaling 8,500, according to the companys website. We are excited to expand BARK Airs service to new cities and through new routes, accommodating customer demand and bringing our unique, stress-free dog-centric travel experience to even more families, BARKs Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer Matt Meeker said in a release about the new routes. Since its launch, BARK Air social media feed has become popular with its videos and photos of dogs going viral. One Instagram Reel has over one million views as it details the extravagant amenities available for dogs as they board and fly on the plane. Source: Travel Leisure --Agencies",

        "date": "June 18, 2024 02:06 pm",
        "content": "Thailands Senate passed the final reading of a marriage equality law on Tuesday, paving the way for the country to become the third territory in Asia to recognise same-sex couples after Nepal and Taiwan. The law gained the support of nearly all upper house lawmakers and will be sent to the palace for royal approval. The law will come into force 120 days after it is published in the royal gazette. LGBTQ advocates called the move a monumental step forward as it would make Thailand the first country in Southeast Asia to enact marriage equality legislation. Thailand is already known for its vibrant LGBTQ culture and tolerance, making it a popular destination for tourists. This would underscore Thailands leadership in the region in promoting human rights and gender equality, the Civil Society Commission of marriage equality, activists and LGBTI couples said. The bill is the culmination more than a decade of effort from activists and politicians, after previous drafts did not reach the parliament. At the start of June, thousands of LGBTQ revellers and activists held a parade through the streets of Bangkok and were joined by Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin, who wore a rainbow shirt to celebrate Pride Month.

UTUJC co-chairman Dhammika S. Priyantha emphasized that the strike action, now in its 48th day, will continue until proper solutions are provided by the authorities. Underscoring the urgency of finding an immediate solution, Priyantha stated that if the UGC also fails to offer adequate solutions, the trade union action will persist. Education Minister Susil Premajayantha commented on the situation, noting that there had been an agreement to address the wage concerns of university non-academic staff next year. He mentioned that a second request came after the increase of the academic allowance for non-academic staff. Premajayantha further explained that there was no budget allocation for these adjustments, and that they are attempting to manage the situation using the remaining funds of the UGC and through various discussions. He highlighted that the UGC is unable to make such payments without the agreement of the Treasury, and expressed hope that the trade unions and the UGC would reach an agreement. Premajayantha also stated that a roadmap would be provided to the trade union in writing to resolve the wage issues and assured that wages would be paid once the staff returned to work.",
