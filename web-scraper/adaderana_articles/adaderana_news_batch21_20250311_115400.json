        "title": "US issues broad freeze on foreign aid after Trump orders review",
        "date": "January 25, 2025 01:22 pm",
        "content": "The U.S. State Department issued a stop-work order on Friday for all existing foreign assistance and paused new aid, according to a cable seen by Reuters, after President Donald Trump ordered a pause to review if aid allocation was aligned with his foreign policy. The cable, drafted by the Departments foreign assistance office and approved by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, said waivers have been issued for military financing for Israel and Egypt. No other countries were mentioned in the cable. The move risks cutting off billions of dollars of life-saving assistance. The United States is the largest single donor of aid globally - in fiscal year 2023, it disbursed 72 billion in assistance. Just hours after taking office on Monday, Trump ordered a 90-day pause in foreign development assistance pending a review of efficiencies and consistency with his foreign policy but the scope of the order was not immediately known. The State Department cable said effective immediately, senior officials shall ensure that, to the maximum extent permitted by law, no new obligations shall be made for foreign assistance until Rubio has made a decision after a review. It says that for existing foreign assistance awards stop-work orders shall be issued immediately until reviewed by Rubio. This is lunacy, Jeremy Konyndyk, a former USAID official who is now president of Refugees International, said. This will kill people. I mean, if implemented as written in that cable ... a lot of people will die. Theres no way to consider this as a good-faith attempt to sincerely review the effectiveness of foreign assistance programming. This is just simply a wrecking ball to break as much stuff as possible, Konyndyk said. Trumps order is unlawful, argued a source familiar discussions in Congress on the move. Freezing these international investments will lead our international partners to seek other funding partners - likely U.S. competitors and adversaries - to fill this hole and displace the United States influence the longer this unlawful impoundment continues, the source said on condition of anonymity. A USAID official, who requested anonymity, said officers responsible for projects in Ukraine have been told to stop all work. Among the projects that have been frozen are support to schools and health assistance like emergency maternal care and childhood vaccinations, the official said. Across the board, decisions whether to continue, modify, or terminate programs will be made by Rubio following a review over the next 85 days. Until then Rubio can approve waivers. Rubio has issued a waiver for emergency food assistance, according to the cable. This comes amid a surge of humanitarian aid into the Gaza Strip after a ceasefire between Israel and Palestinian militants Hamas began on Sunday and several other hunger crises around the world, including Sudan. But Konyndyk said emergency food assistance was just a minority of all humanitarian assistance, adding that nutrition, health and vaccination programs will have to stop, as would relief aid to Gaza and Syria as well as services to refugee camps in Sudan. Its manufactured chaos, said a former senior official with the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), speaking on condition of anonymity. Organizations will have to stop all activities, so all lifesaving health services, HIVAIDS, nutrition, maternal and child health, all agriculture work, all support of civil society organizations, education, said the official. The State Department cable also said waivers have so far been approved by Rubio for foreign military financing for Israel and Egypt and administrative expenses, including salaries, necessary to administer foreign military financing. Israel receives about 3.3 billion in foreign military financing annually, while Egypt receives about 1.3 billion Other states identified for such financing in 2025 include Ukraine, Georgia, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Taiwan, Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam, Djibouti, Colombia, Panama, Ecuador, Israel, Egypt and Jordan, according to a request to Congress from former President Joe Bidens administration. That request also said foreign military financing would also seek to bolster the Lebanese Armed Forces ability to mitigate instability and counter malign Iranian influence. The Lebanese military is currently trying to deploy into the south of the country as Israeli troops withdraw under a ceasefire deal that requires Iran-backed Hezbollah weapons and fighters to also be removed from the area.

The party remains divided into multiple factions due to an ongoing internal crisis.

Many SLFP organizers argue that the party should be formally legalized and contest under the hand symbol, emphasizing that this is essential for the partys future political strength. Although this stance was raised several years ago, conflicting opinions among the party leadership and appointed secretaries prevented its implementation.

        "content": "President Donald Trump has ended his predecessors hold on sending 2,000-pound bombs to Israel, lifting a pressure point that had been meant to reduce civilian casualties during the U.S. allys war with Hamas in Gaza that is now halted by a tenuous ceasefire. In a post on his Truth Social network Saturday, Trump said, A lot of things that were ordered and paid for by Israel, but have not been sent by Biden, are now on their way! A Trump administration official confirmed that he was referring to the heavy bombs. The official was not authorized to give that detail publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. Then-President Joe Biden halted the delivery of the large bombs in May as part of an effort to keep Israel from launching an all-out assault on the southern Gaza city of Rafah. A month later, Israel did take control of the city, but after the vast majority of the 1 million civilians that had been living or sheltering in Rafah had fled. Civilians have been killed in Gaza as a consequence of those bombs and other ways in which they go after population centers, Biden told CNN in May when he held up the weapons. I made it clear that if they go into Rafah ... Im not supplying the weapons that have been used historically to deal with Rafah, to deal with the cities, that deal with that problem. The Biden pause had also held up 1,700 500-pound bombs that had been packaged in the same shipment to Israel, but weeks later those bombs were delivered. Trumps action, five days into his term, comes as he has celebrated the first phase of a ceasefire between Hamas and Israel that has paused the fighting and seen the release of some hostages held by Hamas in Gaza in return for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners held by Israel. Negotiations have yet to begin in earnest on the more difficult second phase of the deal that would eventually see the release of all hostages held by Hamas and an enduring halt to the fighting. The Israeli government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has threatened to resume its war against Hamas  which launched a massive assault against Israel on Oct. 7, 2023  if the remaining hostages are not released.

The person conducting the investigation can present it to the court, if they file a case that can be fabricated to take the investigation forward.

Our effort is to file the case in the High Court, he added. President Dissanayake further revealed, The Attorney Generals Department had recently announced that 11 major cases have been found. Out of these, three cases can be filed in January. One legal officer told me that some files were hidden. They said that if they had gone to file the case at that time, they would have gone home, or they would have released the case.

        "content": "President Anura Kumara Dissanayake has announced that the government has allocated Rs. 5000 million for the purchase of paddy, marking the highest allocation made by any government in recent times for this purpose. Speaking during a friendly gathering in the Pitipana area of Homagama, the President emphasized, We have already allocated Rs. 5000 million for the purchase of paddy. This is the highest amount allocated by a government in recent times. Additionally, we are renovating all of our warehouses, which have a total capacity of 300,000 metric tons. While we may not be able to purchase the entire 300,000 metric tons, we plan to offer these warehouses to private-sector paddy collectors. Then they will be able to store the collected paddy in our warehouses, allowing us to track the available rice. He further explained, We have published an advertisement in the newspaper, announcing that all paddy collectors and rice millers in Sri Lanka must register with the government. From now on, no one who is not registered with the government will be allowed to collect paddy stocks, nor will they be permitted to mill paddy. Registered collectors will also be required to submit a weekly report to the government detailing the amount of paddy they have collected. Addressing concerns about rice stock levels, the President remarked, I recently saw an official from the Ministry of Agriculture testify before the COPE (Committee on Public Enterprises) stating that one million metric tons of rice is missing. We need to determine where this rice is. The total capacity of all government-owned warehouses is 300,000 metric tons, and the main mills owned by millers in Polonnaruwa also have a total capacity of 300,000 metric tons. Even if all these warehouses are stocked with paddy, we would have only 600,000 metric tons. We must be cautious moving forward. The time when a country could act with guesses has passed. The world no longer moves with guesses, but with data. However, we do not know the amount of rice produced, which is our staple food, nor do we know the amount consumed. Therefore, we are quickly building a strong data system. Give me two more weeks, and I assure you there will not be a single grain of rice missing from the Sri Lankan market, let alone any shortages below the guaranteed price, he said.",

Additionally, to my knowledge, three SriLankan Airlines aircraft were grounded for three years without engines. The previous government led by Ranil Wickremesinghe paid 9 million per month to keep these aircraft grounded for three years. Thats what they did well. Now, as far as I know, under the leadership of individuals like Ganegoda, efforts have been made to secure the necessary funds. One of the grounded aircraft is already back in operation, and the other two are expected to be operational before April.

        "content": "Kamindu Mendis, who shone for Sri Lanka with consistent batting displays in the year gone by, has been named as the ICC Mens Emerging Cricketer of the Year. Mendis, who scored 1451 runs across formats at an average just above 50, rubbed shoulders with some of the greats of the game in 2024. The flamboyant left-handed batter had made just a solitary Test appearance for Sri Lanka prior to 2024, but ended the year having not only cemented his place as an all-format resource for Sri Lanka but also becoming their go-to-player in moments of crises and when the stakes were high. This was on the show during Sri Lankas push for a maiden ICC World Test Championship Final spot as the 26-year-old delivered a streak of big scores in the whites. Mendis year in review: 1049 runs from nine Tests, averaging 74.92 Slotting in the middle-order, Mendis was one of the six batters who scored over 1000 Test runs in the recently concluded calendar year - averaging the highest among them. Making the most of his starts, Mendis hit five centuries and three fifties in his staggering tally of runs, taking Sri Lanka home on multiple occasions. While on his hot streak, the 26-year-old also became the joint-third quickest to score 1000 runs in Mens Tests - equalling Sir Don Bradmans 13-innings mark to reach the milestone. His exploits with the bat helped Sri Lanka attain crucial Test wins against New Zealand, Bangladesh and England, delivering in both home and away conditions. In England, Mendis finished as Sri Lankas leading run-getter in a three-Test series, and played a crucial role in the visiting sides first Test win in the country after a decades wait. Memorable performance The southpaws most impressive outing came in the second Test against New Zealand in Galle, where Mendis forged his career-best score in the longest format of the game. An unbeaten 182 in the first innings helped Sri Lanka post a mammoth total of 6025, and laid the foundation for a 2-0 series sweep for Sri Lanka. The attacking innings was constructed over 250 deliveries and was laced with 16 boundaries and four maximums, earning Mendis the Player of the Match award. --ICC",

These remarks were made by President Anura Kumara Disanayake during the Anuradhapura District Coordination Committee meeting held today (26) at the Anuradhapura District Secretariat. The President revealed that efforts are underway to establish an accurate data system for the public service by June and pointed out the significant complexity in the current volume of data within the public service, which hampers the ability to make precise decisions, the PMD stated. President Disanayake also disclosed that proposals to provide a fair basic salary increase for public officials and to resolve pension disparities within three years will be included in this years budget. The meeting also focused on strengthening the public service while managing its costs effectively. Attention was drawn to the urgent need to fill approximately 30,000 existing vacancies within the public service, with discussions on allocating necessary funds for this initiative in the upcoming budget. Delays in recruitment due to technical procedures, including interview processes, were also addressed, emphasizing the need for unified human resource management within the public service, the statement said. The President directed attention to multiple sectors in the Anuradhapura District, including education, healthcare, irrigation, agriculture, and human-elephant conflict. Discussions were held on the potential to develop Anuradhapura as a tourism hub, with a focus on leveraging the City Branding approach to transform Anuradhapura into an attractive tourist destination. The city, which already attracts a significant number of local tourists, was identified as having excellent potential to appeal to foreign tourists as well.

        "date": "January 26, 2025 07:20 pm",
        "content": "South Koreas prosecutors indicted impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol on Sunday on charges of leading an insurrection with his short-lived imposition of martial law on Dec. 3, Yoons lawyers and the main opposition party said. Yoons lawyers criticized the indictment as the worst choice made by the prosecution service, while the main opposition party welcomed the decision. The charges are unprecedented for a South Korean president, and if convicted, Yoon could face years in prison for his shock martial law decree, which sought to ban political and parliamentary activity and control the media. His move set off a wave of political upheaval in Asias fourth-largest economy and a top U.S. ally, with the prime minister also impeached and suspended from power and a number of top military officials indicted for their roles in the alleged insurrection. (The) Presidents declaration of emergency martial law was a desperate plea to the public over a national crisis caused by the opposition getting out of control, Yoons lawyers said in a statement. The prosecutors office did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The indictment was also reported by South Korean media. Anti-corruption investigators last week recommended charging the jailed Yoon, who was impeached by parliament and suspended from his duties on Dec. 14. A former top prosecutor himself, Yoon has been in solitary confinement since becoming the first sitting president to be arrested on Jan. 15 after days of defiant, armed standoff between his security detail and arresting officials. Over the weekend a court twice refused the prosecutors request to extend his detention while they conducted further investigation, but with the charges they have again requested that he be kept in custody, media reports said. Insurrection is one of the few criminal charges from which a South Korean president does not have immunity. It is punishable by life imprisonment or death, although South Korea has not executed anyone in decades. The prosecution has decided to indict Yoon Suk Yeol, who is facing charges of being a ringleader of insurrection, Democratic Party spokesman Han Min-soo told a press conference. The punishment of the ringleader of insurrection now begins finally. Yoon and his lawyers argued at a Constitutional Court hearing last week in his impeachment trial that he never intended to fully impose martial law but had only meant the measures as a warning to break a political deadlock. In parallel with the criminal process, the top court will determine whether to remove Yoon from office or reinstate his presidential powers. It has 180 days to decide on that. South Koreas opposition-led parliament impeached Yoon on Dec. 14, making him the second conservative president to be impeached in the country. Yoon rescinded his martial law declaration within about six hours after lawmakers, confronting soldiers in parliament, voted down the decree. During the dramatic confrontation, soldiers with rifles, body armour and night-vision equipment were seen entering the parliament building through smashed windows. If Yoon is removed from office, a presidential election will be held within 60 days. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "content": "The Sri Lankan Navy assumed command of a multinational maritime training task force during a change-of-command ceremony in Bahrain, Jan. 26. Egyptian Navy Commodore Haytham Khalil turned over command of Combined Task Force (CTF) 154 to Sri Lankan Navy Commodore KMH Bettage. This will be the first time a CTF is commanded by Sri Lanka, which joined the Combined Maritime Forces (CMF) in Nov. 2023. During Khalils tenure, CTF 154 established monthly Maritime Security Enhance Training sessions which focused on topics including, but not limited to, navigation and safety at sea, firefighting, public affairs, and pollution event crisis management. This is in addition to key partner engagements and working alongside other maritime organizations, such as the European Union Naval Force. Our collective efforts have strengthened maritime security and fostered cooperation, said Khalil. Your tireless work has yielded remarkable results, enhanced monthly training, and elevated our readiness and operation. I am honored to have led such a talented and cohesive team. CTF 154 conducts multinational maritime training at locations across the Middle East, enabling more CMF partner-nations to participate in training opportunities without ships or aircraft, particularly during courses that are facilitated ashore. It organizes training events around five core areas: maritime awareness, maritime law, maritime interdiction, maritime rescue and assistance, and leadership development. Each training opportunity is tailored to meet partner requests ranging from basic to advanced levels. CTF 154s core staff consists of members from Canada, Egypt, Jordan, Seychelles, Türkiye, and the United States. This will be the first time a CTF is commanded by Sri Lanka, which joined the CMF in Nov. 2023. I believe training and collaboration are essential to maritime commerce and security, Bettage said. By fostering partnerships between nations and industries, we can address threats, optimize operations and protect vital trade routes together. These efforts strengthen the global maritime industry and support economic growth. CTF 154 was established May 2023, and is one of five operational task forces under Combined Maritime Forces. CMFs other task forces include CTF 150 that focuses on maritime security in the Gulf of Oman and Indian Ocean; CTF 151, which leads regional counter-piracy efforts; CTF 152, dedicated to maritime security in the Arabian Gulf; and CTF 153 in the Red Sea. CMF headquartered in Bahrain with U.S. Naval Forces Central Command and U.S. 5th Fleet, is the largest multinational naval partnership in the world, with 46 nations committed to upholding the international rules-based order at sea. It promotes security, stability and prosperity across approximately 3.2 million square miles of international waters, encompassing some of the worlds most important shipping lanes.",

        "date": "January 27, 2025 06:44 am",
        "content": "President Donald Trump said on Sunday he will impose sweeping retaliatory measures on Colombia, including tariffs and sanctions, after the South American country turned away two U.S. military aircraft with migrants being deported as part of the new U.S. administrations immigration crackdown. Colombia, the third largest U.S. trading partner in Latin America, swiftly responded, threatening a 50 tariff on U.S. goods. The countrys leftist president, Gustavo Petro, later posted on X that he directed his trade minister to increase tariffs on U.S. imports by 25. Colombia is the second Latin American nation to refuse U.S. military deportation flights. Trumps punitive action demonstrated his more muscular U.S. foreign policy and his renewed willingness to force countries to bend to his will. Trump wrote on Truth Social that Petros refusal to accept the flights jeopardized U.S. national security. The retaliatory measures include imposing 25 tariffs on all Colombian goods coming into the U.S., which will go up to 50 in one week; a travel ban and visa revocations on Colombian government officials; and emergency treasury, banking and financial sanctions. Trump said he would also direct enhanced border inspections of Colombian nationals and cargo. These measures are just the beginning, he wrote. We will not allow the Colombian Government to violate its legal obligations with regard to the acceptance and return of the Criminals they forced into the United States! He later posted a picture of himself on Truth Social in a pinstripe suit and a fedora in front of a sign reading FAFO, a common slang acronym for Fuck Around and Find Out. America will no longer be lied to nor taken advantage of, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio in a statement, adding that Petro had authorized these flights but then canceled his authorization when the planes were in the air. Sweeping Crackdown Trump declared illegal immigration a national emergency and imposed a sweeping crackdown since taking office last Monday. He directed the U.S. military to help with border security, issued a broad ban on asylum and took steps to restrict citizenship for children born on U.S. soil. Colombias Petro condemned the practice on Sunday, suggesting it treated migrants like criminals. In a post on social media platform X, Petro said Colombia would welcome home deported migrants on civilian planes. The U.S. cannot treat Colombian migrants as criminals, Petro wrote. Petro said even though there were 15,660 Americans without legal immigration status in Colombia, he would never carry out a raid to return handcuffed Americans to the U.S. We are the opposite of the Nazis, he wrote. Mexico also refused a request last week to let a U.S. military aircraft land with migrants. Trump did not take similar action against Mexico, the largest U.S. trading partner, but has said he was thinking about imposing 25 duties on imports from Canada and Mexico on Feb. 1 to force further action against illegal immigrants and fentanyl flowing into the U.S. The U.S. is Colombias largest trading partner, largely due to a 2006 free trade agreement, with 33.8 billion worth of two-way trade in 2023 and a 1.6 billion U.S. trade surplus, according to U.S. Census Bureau data. The biggest U.S. imports from Colombia that year were crude oil, gold, coffee, and cut roses. Top U.S. exports to Colombia were gasoline and other petroleum products, commercial aircraft, corn, crude oil and soybeans. Petros finding out that tweets have consequences. Hes not (facing) a U.S. counterpart that looks at Colombia through a strategic lens, as a key ally, but as a country to make an example of, said Sergio Guzman, director of consultancy Colombia Risk Analysis. Guzman added that financial sanctions could be economically crippling. Alejo Czerwonko, chief investment officer for emerging markets Americas at UBS Global Wealth Management, said Colombia relied on access to the U.S. market for about a third of its exports, or about 4 of its GDP. In addition, the Petro-Trump relationship has started off on the wrong foot, which could signal additional challenges ahead, Czerwonko told Reuters. Growing Discontent Petros comments added to the growing chorus of discontent in Latin America as Trumps week-old administration starts mobilizing for mass deportations. Brazils foreign ministry on Saturday condemned degrading treatment of Brazilians after migrants were handcuffed on a commercial deportation flight. Upon arrival, some passengers also reported mistreatment during the flight, according to local news reports. The plane, which was carrying 88 Brazilian passengers, 16 U.S. security agents, and eight crew members, had been originally scheduled to arrive in Belo Horizonte in the southeastern state of Minas Gerais. However, at an unscheduled stop due to technical problems in Manaus, capital of Amazonas, Brazilian officials ordered removal of the handcuffs, and President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva designated a Brazilian Air Force (FAB) flight to complete their journey, the government said in a statement on Saturday. The commercial charter flight was the second this year from the U.S. carrying undocumented migrants deported back to Brazil and the first since Trumps inauguration, according to Brazils federal police. U.S. officials did not reply to requests for comment about Brazil. The use of U.S. military aircraft to carry out deportation flights is part of the Pentagons response to Trumps national emergency declaration on immigration on Monday. In the past, U.S. military aircraft have been used to relocate individuals from one country to another, like during the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021. This has been the first time in recent memory that U.S. military aircraft were used to fly migrants out of the country, one U.S. official said. U.S. military aircraft carried out two similar flights, each with about 80 migrants, to Guatemala on Friday. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

Rajapaksa accused the government of targeting his family members rather than addressing the countrys pressing issues. Speaking to the media following the court hearing involving his brother Yoshitha Rajapaksa, the MP alleged that members of the current administration have also been involved in illegally acquiring land and have ongoing court cases against them. Law must be enacted equally on everyone, including them, Rajapaksa asserted, urging the government not to politicize legal proceedings. He further alleged that the government is seeking revenge against his family, particularly his brother Yoshitha, while he himself is the one voicing criticism of the government in Parliament. Namal claimed that Yoshitha Rajapaksas recent arrest was nothing more than a media spectacle orchestrated at the expense of public funds. Responding to a question whether hes trying to fail the government, Rajapaksa remarked: We are not the ones who turned pol sambol into a national crime, nor did we claim the rice shortage was due to dogs and cats eating rice. The failure of the government should be questioned by those who made such statements. Yoshitha Rajapaksa, the second son of former President Mahinda, who had been remanded in custody, was granted bail after being produced before the Colombo Magistrates Court this morning (27).

        "date": "January 27, 2025 01:23 pm",
        "content": "Local politicians in Edinburgh have approved a tourist tax for visitors staying overnight the Scottish capital, introducing the first charge of its kind in the United Kingdom. From mid-2026, visitors staying in certain types of accommodation, such a hotel, bed and breakfast, hostel, self-catering apartment or guest house, will be charged a fee of 5 of their accommodation cost per night. The charge is capped at five consecutive nights, according to the local authority. Accommodation providers will be responsible for collecting the fee on behalf of the authority. Ahead of the vote, Jane Meagher, head of City of Edinburgh Council, told councillors that tourism puts strain on the citys resources, which needs funds to develop in a planned and sustainable way. In 2023, Edinburgh received nearly 5 million overnight visitors, who spent 2.2 billion (2.7 billion), according to national tourism body Visit Scotlands website. The council expects the new fee to raise 45-50 million (56-62 million) a year by 2028 or 2029. A tourist tax in Edinburgh has been under discussion since 2018 and became possible when the Visitor Levy (Scotland) Act came into effect in July. Under the act, revenue from the levy must be used to support local facilities and services that business and leisure visitors use heavily, according to the City of Edinburgh Council website. Some councillors said ahead of the vote that they wanted the charge to be higher, expressing a desire for revenue generated from the levy to be spent on giving residents affordable housing, with housing said to be currently too costly for many people working in hospitality. Local residents and businesses were consulted after a draft visitor levy was unveiled in August. While just over half of residents and businesses agreed with a 5 charge, the majority of visitors (62) were against a levy or thought the fee should be lower, according to a local authority notice. The cap on the number of nights for the charge was originally drafted as seven but it was reduced to five after observations from Visit Scotland and Edinburgh Festivals, which highlighted that performers and other festival workers during events often stay for several weeks. Councillors approved the plan last week, ahead of Fridays final decision, with Meagher calling the move a once in a lifetime opportunity to invest tens of millions of pounds towards enhancing and sustaining the things that make our city such a great place to visit  and live in  all year round, according to a news release. Edinburgh joins a growing list of European cities to introduce a tourist tax in recent years. The Welsh government plans to introduce similar legislation to Scotland this year. Venice experimented with a temporary entrance fee for day-trippers last year and officials hailed the program a success for raising millions of euros. Amsterdam is thought to have the highest tourist tax in Europe, with a nightly fee built into hotel room prices of 12.5 of the room rate. The same charge is applied to camping sites and holiday rentals in the Dutch capital, while sea and river cruise operators must pay 14.50 (15.20) per passenger, according to the City of Amsterdam website.

        "date": "January 27, 2025 01:30 pm",
        "content": "Digital news units of Indian billionaires Gautam Adani and Mukesh Ambani, and other outlets like the Indian Express and the Hindustan Times, have mounted a legal challenge against OpenAI alleging it improperly used copyright content, legal papers show. The media outlets including Adanis NDTV and Ambanis Network18 have told a New Delhi court they want to join an ongoing lawsuit against the ChatGPT creator, as they are worried their news websites are being scraped to store and reproduce their work to users of the powerful AI tool. Reuters is first to report the case filing by the digital news publishers, which escalates an ongoing legal battle against ChatGPT in India. In the most high-profile battle, local news agency ANI was first to file a lawsuit against OpenAI last year. Global and Indian book publishers have also now joined in. The 135-page case filing in the New Delhi court, which is not public but was reviewed by Reuters, argues OpenAIs conduct constitutes a clear and present danger to the valuable copyrights of Digital News Publishers Association (DNPA) members and other outlets. It refers to OpenAIs wilful scraping ... and adaptation of content. Courts across the world are hearing claims by authors, news outlets and musicians who accuse technology firms of using their copyright work to train AI services and who are seeking to have content used to train the chatbot deleted. The filing was made by the Indian Express, Hindustan Times, Adanis NDTV and the DNPA, which represents roughly 20 companies including Mukesh Ambani Network18 and players like Hindi daily Dainik Bhaskar, Zee News, India Today Group and the Hindu. Many of these outlets have a flourishing newspaper and television news business too. The Times of India is not taking part in the legal challenge despite being member of the DNPA. OpenAI did not respond to a request for comment on the new allegations. It has repeatedly denied such allegations, saying its AI systems make fair use of publicly available data. None of the Indian media companies immediately responded to Reuters request for comment. Landmark India Case The new intervention by Indian outlets will add firepower to ANIs lawsuit against the Microsoft-backed OpenAI, which is the most high-profile legal proceeding in the nation on this subject. A hearing in ANIs lawsuit against OpenAI is scheduled for Tuesday. Responding to the ANI case, OpenAI said in comments reported by Reuters last week that any order to delete training data would result in a violation of its U.S. legal obligations, and Indian judges have no jurisdiction to hear a copyright case against the company as its servers are located abroad. Reuters, which holds a 26 interest in ANI, has said in a statement it is not involved in ANIs business practices or operations. In recent months, OpenAI has signed deals with Time magazine, the Financial Times, Business Insider-owner Axel Springer, Frances Le Monde and Spains Prisa Media to display content. The Indian publishers in their new filing argue OpenAI has entered into partnership agreements with media outlets abroad, but has not entered into similar deals in India, hurting the media companies. Such conduct by OpenAI in India betrays an inexplicable defiance of the law, the Indian media outlets filing said. The publishers also said OpenAI was set to become a profit-driven business benefiting from the creative works of the media industry. This would result in a weakened press and would not be in the best interests of a vibrant democracy, their filing said. OpenAI kicked off an investment, consumer and corporate frenzy in generative AI after the Nov. 2022 launch of ChatGPT. It wants to be ahead in the AI race after raising 6.6 billion last year. It made its first India hire last year when it tapped a former WhatsApp executive, Pragya Misra, to handle public policy and partnerships in the country of 1.4 billion people, where millions of new users are going online, thanks to cheap mobile data prices.

        "content": "South Koreas authorities investigating last months Jeju Air plane crash have submitted a preliminary accident report to the UN aviation agency and to the authorities of the United States, France and Thailand, an official said on Monday. The investigation into the deadliest air disaster on the countrys soil remains ongoing, the report made available on Monday said, focused on the role of bird strike and involving an analysis of the engines and the localizer landing guidance structure. These all-out investigation activities aim to determine the accurate cause of the accident, it said. The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), the UN agency, requires accident investigators to produce a preliminary report within 30 days of the accident and encourages a final report to be made public within 12 months. The Boeing 737-800 jet, from Bangkok and scheduled to arrive at Muan International Airport, overshot the runway as it made an emergency belly landing and crashed into the localizer structure, killing all but two of the 181 people and crew members on board on December 29. The localizer aids navigation of an aircraft making an approach to the runway, and the structure built of reinforced concrete and earth at Muan airport supporting the systems antennae was likely a cause of the disaster, experts have said. The report highlighted much of the initial findings by the South Korean investigators that was shared with the families of the victims on Saturday, including the pilots discussing a flock of birds they spotted on its final approach. The exact time of a bird strike reported by the pilots remains unconfirmed, the accident report said, but the aircraft made an emergency declaration for a bird strike during a go-around. Both engines were examined, and feathers and bird blood stains were found on each, it said. After the crash into the embankment, fire and a partial explosion occurred. Both engines were buried in the embankments soil mound, and the fore fuselage scattered up to 30-200 meters from the embankment, it said. The report does not say what may have led to the two data recorders to stop recording simultaneously just before the pilots declared mayday. The aircraft was at an altitude of 498 ft (152 metres) flying at 161 knots (298 kmh or 185 mph) at the moment the blackboxes stopped recording, it said. Source: CNN --Agencies",

        "date": "January 27, 2025 02:41 pm",
        "content": "The Colombo Magistrates Court today (27) granted bail to Yoshitha Rajapaksa, the second son of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, who was remanded under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act. The decision came after a lengthy hearing presided over by Colombo Additional Magistrate Manjula Ratnayake. Rajapaksa was released on two surety bails of Rs. 50 million each, with additional bail conditions imposed. These include an overseas travel ban, monthly reporting to the Financial Crimes Investigation Division (FCID) on the last Sunday of each month, and a strict directive to avoid influencing witnesses. During the trial, the court was told that the charges against Yoshitha Rajapaksa stem from multiple investigations related to alleged money laundering activities. Additional Solicitor General Dilipa Peiris, representing the FCID, presented evidence linking the suspect to suspicious property transactions, including the purchase of a Rs. 350 million house in Sirimal Mawatha, Ratmalana, in 2012. Investigations revealed the property was acquired in the name of Daisy Forrest, the grandmother of the suspect, who had worked in modest positions such as a hospital employee, teacher, and hostel warden, Peiris stated, noting that her declared income was insufficient to support such a purchase, and her statements to police were inconsistent, suggesting involvement of undisclosed funds. The Additional Solicitor General mentioned that further inquiries uncovered the deed to the property in the possession of an individual, Palitha Gamage, who claimed it was given to him by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa. The Additional Solicitor General argued this demonstrated an attempt to obscure the true ownership of the property and highlighted concerns over undisclosed income and the circulation of laundered money. He also detailed Yoshitha Rajapaksas income as a Navy Lieutenant from 2006 to 2016, where his monthly salary of Rs. 73,000 was directly credited to his account without withdrawals. The prosecution questioned how such limited income could justify the purchase of a high-value property. Presidents Counsel Sampath Mendis, representing the defendant, countered that the investigation into the property transaction began over eight years ago and has not reached a conclusion. He noted that the primary suspect, Daisy Forrest, was released on bail without being remanded, and argued that it was unfair to hold Yoshitha Rajapaksa in custody when the main suspect had been granted leniency. Mendis also emphasized the delayed progress of the investigation, highlighting that case files were forwarded to the Attorney Generals Department in 2018 but remain unresolved. He urged the court to release the suspect on bail under appropriate conditions. In his ruling, Additional Magistrate Manjula Ratnayake emphasized the importance of freezing assets involved in money laundering cases. However, he noted that the property in question had not been frozen. While acknowledging the seriousness of the case, the Additional Magistrate stated that the prosecution failed to provide sufficient evidence to justify further remanding the suspect. The Additional Magistrate dismissed the prosecutions argument that public unrest and the gravity of the charges warranted continued detention, stating that remanding a suspect requires substantive evidence rather than generalized claims. Based on the facts presented, the court ruled in favor of releasing Yoshitha Rajapaksa on bail, while reiterating the need for continued investigation into the allegations. However, the Additional Solicitor General Dilipa Peiris, representing the FCID, stated to the court that this case is part of a broader investigation involving three separate money laundering allegations against Yoshitha Rajapaksa. These include: -The purchase of a Rs. 50 million worth house in Dehiwala -Investments in the CSN Channel -The purchase of the Rs. 350 million Ratmalana property The investigations will continue under the FCID, with further court proceedings expected, Ada Derana reporter said.",

        "date": "January 27, 2025 07:11 pm",
        "content": "Minister of Justice Harshana Nanayakkara has addressed concerns circulating on social media regarding the recent granting of bail to Yoshitha Rajapaksa, the second son of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, emphasizing that the decision was made following due legal process under the provisions of the Bail Act. Speaking to the media, the Minister acknowledged public doubts about whether the current government is mirroring the practices of previous administrations in handling high-profile legal cases. There is a perception, fueled by past experiences, that arrests and detentions are followed by a media spectacle, only for individuals to be released shortly after. That is not the case here, he stated. Minister Nanayakkara clarified that granting bail does not equate to an acquittal. Instead, it is part of a legal process where the courts evaluate factors such as the likelihood of the suspect fleeing, the potential for interfering with investigations, and their previous criminal record. If none of these concerns arise, the usual course of action is to grant bail, he added. The Minister explained that the allegations against Yoshitha Rajapaksa date back eight years, during which he had not been named as a suspect. He suggested that political circumstances may have influenced the delay in bringing the case forward. Recently, the Attorney General directed the police to follow standard procedure, naming Rajapaksa as a suspect to obtain his statement, which led to his court appearance, according to the Justice Minister. Addressing public and media skepticism, the Minister assured that the case would proceed without interference. This case involves money laundering, and filing the necessary charges is part of the due process. The courts decision to grant bail does not absolve Yoshitha Rajapaksa of the charges, he said. He urged patience, stating, In another two to three months, the public will see whether the National Peoples Power government is truly committed to a new path of governance or reverting to old patterns.",

Speaking at a press conference today (27), Deputy Minister Karunaratne stated that this delay is a strategic move to allow the private sector to purchase paddy at higher prices amidst active market demand. However, several weeks into the harvesting of the Maha cultivation season, the government has yet to establish a guaranteed price for paddy. Farmers associations have voiced their frustration, arguing that this delay has enabled the private sector to exploit the situation by purchasing paddy at unreasonably low prices. Representatives of farmers associations are calling for immediate government intervention to ensure fair pricing and protect the livelihood of farmers.

        "date": "January 28, 2025 06:43 am",
        "content": "About a dozen Justice Department employees who worked for former special counsel Jack Smith on the investigation and prosecution of President Trump are being fired, two sources familiar with the matter confirmed to CBS News. The federal prosecutors were informed of the decision to terminate their positions via a letter sent over email after Justice Department leadership determined they were unable to carry out Mr. Trumps agenda. Acting Attorney General James McHenry made this decision because he did not believe these officials could be trusted to faithfully implement the presidents agenda because of their significant role in prosecuting the president, a Justice Department official told CBS News. Smith was appointed by Attorney General Merrick Garland in 2022 and took over two ongoing investigations of the president, one related to his handling of classified records and the other tied to his conduct following the 2020 presidential election. Both cases were dismissed after Mr. Trump won the 2024 presidential election. Smith informed the judges overseeing the cases that Justice Department policy forbids the prosecution of a sitting president. Throughout his probes, the former special counsel amassed a staff of prosecutors and agents to conduct grand jury investigations and try the cases in court. It is not immediately clear which members of Smiths team were fired, but the move makes good on a Trump campaign promise to clean house in the Justice Department. Last week, the president signed an executive order to take on the weaponization of the federal government, a characterization he applied to Smiths prosecutions. Fox News was first to report on the firings. The news of the firings came on the same day that Washington, D.C.s top federal prosecutor launched an internal review of the charging decisions behind hundreds of Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot cases. Two people familiar with the move confirmed to CBS News that Acting U.S. Attorney Edward Martin ordered prosecutors in his office to turn in documents, emails and other information related to the previous administrations decision to bring an obstruction charge against more than 200 Capitol attack defendants. The cases at issue are those in which defendants were charged with obstruction of an official proceeding, a charge that the Supreme Court later ruled was too broadly applied by federal prosecutors. Throughout the sprawling Jan. 6 investigation that abruptly came to an end last week after President Trump pardoned more than 1,500 individuals, defendants and their attorneys brought challenges against the obstruction case on multiple fronts as they contested the Justice Departments application of the law in the Capitol riot cases. The Supreme Court ultimately limited prosecutors use of the statute. The new review is set to examine the decision making behind the use of that charge, the people said. News of the review was first reported by the Wall Street Journal. The U.S. attorneys office did not respond to a request for comment. Smith  who resigned from his position following the completion of his investigation  wrote in his report on the probe that his team had collected evidence sufficient to obtain and sustain a conviction at trial, if the case involving Mr. Trumps alleged conduct around the 2020 election had gone to trial. Only the first volume of Smiths report, which described the investigation into Mr. Trumps post-2020 election conduct, was released to the public. The second volume is currently shielded from public view while an appeal in the classified documents case is ongoing. In the report, Smith defended his work as apolitical. And in a letter accompanying the final draft, he wrote, To all who know me well, the claim from Mr. Trump that my decisions as a prosecutor were influenced or directed by the Biden administration or other political actors is, in a word, laughable. Mr. Trump called Smith desperate and deranged and consistently denied wrongdoing throughout the investigations. Also on Monday, the chief of the Justice Departments Public Integrity Section resigned from his position after being reassigned, a source familiar with the matter confirmed to CBS News. The official was appointed to the position during the first Trump administration, and his political corruption unit later advised Smith on various aspects of cases against Mr. Trump, according to court documents. NBC News first reported the resignation. The Justice Department did not respond to requests for comment. Last week, numerous career Justice Department officials who held high-profile positions were reassigned. The officials affected included senior criminal and national security leaders within two of the departments most critical sections, two sources told CBS News at the time. The career officials have handled numerous high-profile investigations across administrations. Source: CBS News --Agencies",

        "date": "January 28, 2025 07:34 am",
        "content": "A rare celestial event is captivating stargazers as six planets align in a striking display, says Professor Chandana Jayaratne, Director of the Astronomy and Space Sciences Unit at the University of Colombos Department of Physics. The alignment features Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune, which can be observed along the same general path in the night sky. According to Professor Jayaratne, this extraordinary phenomenon is visible to the naked eye for approximately 90 minutes after sunset on clear evenings. This is a unique opportunity for enthusiasts to witness a rare planetary parade without specialized equipment, he added. During this astronomical alignment, commonly known as a planetary parade, all the planets meet up on the same side of the Sun forming an expansive arc above the Earth. Interestingly, most of these are visible to the naked eye if the night sky is clear. When to watch the planet parade? Beginning on January 21 and reaching its peak around January 29, this breathtaking phenomenon will continue to be visible until mid-February. Although the six planets - Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune - can be best viewed on January 25, the alignment is taking over the sky for two months, with Mercury joining the parade of planets by the end of February; which eventually will make a planet parade of seven planets. Mercury will reach its peak visibility from February 28 to March 12, completing the cosmic display of seven planets. While the planets wont be perfectly aligned, their placement will follow the orbital plane of our solar system. How to watch the planet parade? To witness a planet parade, you can primarily use your naked eyes to see the brighter planets like Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn; however, for a better view of fainter planets like Uranus and Neptune, youll need binoculars or a telescope. Choose a place darker and away from the city lights for a better view. This celestial event, visible to the naked eye, offers a rare chance for everyone to marvel at the wonders of our solar system! And you shouldnt miss it. What is the best time to watch? The best time to catch the event is about 45-90 minutes after sunset. The four planets - Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn - will be visible to the naked eye just after the sun goes down, but Uranus and Neptune will require a telescope. Whats so special about the planet parade? What makes this event noteworthy? The fact that six planets will be visible, four of them with the naked eye. However, such events are not just a spectacle for stargazers  they can also have a real impact on our Solar System and offer the potential to gain new insights into our place within it. The eight major planets of our Solar System orbit the Sun in the same flat plane, and all at different speeds. Mercury, the closest planet to the Sun, completes an orbit  a year for the planet  in 88 days. Earths year, of course, is 365 days, while at the upper end, Neptune takes a whopping 60,190 days, or about 165 Earth years, to complete a single revolution of our star. The different speeds of the planets mean that, on occasion, several of them can be roughly lined up on the same side of the Sun. From Earth, if the orbits line up just right, we can see multiple planets in our night sky at the same time. In rare events, all the planets will line up such that they all appear in our night sky together along the ecliptic, the path traced by the Sun. On the other hand, while, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn are all bright enough to be visible to the naked eye, Uranus and Neptune require binoculars or a telescope to spot. In January and February, you can witness the rare event of the planet parade taking place. The planets are not exactly lined up, so they will appear in an arc across the sky due to their orbital plane in the Solar System. During clear nights in January and February, all of the planets except Mercury will be visible. On 28 February, all seven planets will be visible, a great spectacle for observers on the ground. According to Jenifer Millard, a science communicator and astronomer at Fifth Star Labs in the UK, There is something special about looking at the planets with your own eyes. Yes, you can go on Google and get a more spectacular view of all these planets. But when youre looking at these objects, these are photons that have travelled millions or billions of miles through space to hit your retinas. --With agencies inputs",

        "date": "January 28, 2025 09:29 am",
        "content": "Its a matter of national pride, with carefully chosen teams spending years training in pursuit of winning the highest honor in their fields and representing their country on the global stage. No, not the soccer World Cup. The Pastry World Cup. The biennial event features contestants from as far afield as Egypt, Mauritius and South Korea in a sweet showdown where teams compete to create the best once-in-a-lifetime desserts. This years competition took place on January 20 and 21. Each team had three members  specialists in chocolate, ice, and sugar respectively. The trios were tasked with developing three desserts that would represent their country: a frozen dessert, a restaurant dessert  which can have a special garnish added at the judging table  and a show chocolate. And they only had five hours to pull it all off. The pastry chefs relied on both ingredients and designs to highlight their countries culinary delights. The Chinese team put together an elaborate dragon made of sugar, while Mexicos competitors incorporated chocolate, corn and other native foods into their desserts. In addition to representing their homelands on plates, competitors wore themed outfits and accessories. Frances team members sported chic Breton striped shirts and berets, Mexicos chefs wore Day of the Dead sugar skull-inspired masks, and Team UK worked on their desserts while wearing natty newsboy caps and bow ties. The winners circle Although the 2025 event was held in Lyon, the French team did not win the gold medal, settling for silver. Top honors went to returning champions Japan, whose team put together a lemon, pear, marigold and chocolate granita in the shape of an Asanoha (hemp) leaf for their restaurant dessert entry. For the frozen dessert, the team offered an apricot treat resembling a spinning top toy. We packed the history and culture of Japan into the design. We were able to incorporate taste and delicate traditional patterns to showcase our techniques, said chef Masanori Hata, the chocolate expert on his team. I dont remember the moment we won. I was so surprised and couldnt believe it. Japan was recognized two tournaments in a row. Im happy and proud. Meanwhile, the French team prepared a showstopping series of chocolate eggs that were filled with chocolate-hazelnut soufflé mousse topped with chocolate streusel, dipped in a citrus-vanilla-infused clarified butter and paired with grilled vanilla ice cream and a clementine confit. Bronze went to Malaysia, the Southeast Asian countrys highest-ever result in the contest. Team Malaysia scored high marks for its frozen dessert, which they described as a harmonious blend of bright citrus, sweet apricot, and subtle spices, a nod to the countrys multicultural heritage.

        "date": "January 28, 2025 11:01 am",
        "content": "President Anura Kumara Dissanayake has stated that the current government is determined to make all necessary decisions for the countrys advancement and to improve the quality of life for its citizens. The president expressed these views during an event held yesterday (27) at the Sri Lanka Customs Auditorium to mark International Customs Day under the theme, Customs Delivering on its Commitment to Efficiency, Security and Prosperity, the Presidents Media Division (PMD) reported. The Customs Co-operation Council (CCC), established in 1952 with the participation of 17 European countries is independent intergovernmental body whose mission is to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of Customs administrations. This council quickly became globally recognized, and Sri Lanka became a member in 1967. In 1994, the Customs Cooperation Council was renamed the World Customs Organization (WCO). The first session of the Customs Cooperation Council was held on January 26, 1953, in Brussels, Belgium, marking the establishment of International Customs Day. As a result, every year on January 26, customs administration institutions across the world celebrate International Customs Day. The President also mentioned that necessary actions are being taken to create a modern organizational structure, with structural reforms being implemented within Sri Lanka Customs, the Department of Excise, and the Department of Inland Revenue, the PMD said. The President stated that laws and institutions must evolve to meet the challenges of the times and cannot remain static or permanent indefinitely. Elaborating further, President Disanayake shared the following insights: Customs successfully fulfilled its responsibilities over the past year, and its efforts in stabilizing the economy are highly commendable. The achievements in meeting last years targets are being appropriately recognized. However, simply achieving revenue targets is not enough to rebuild a collapsed economy. Addressing the economic crisis requires increasing the revenue-to-GDP ratio. The economic collapse has significantly disrupted the import-export market. All of our actions are currently being carried out within the parameters set by the International Monetary Fund (IMF). While surface-level indicators may suggest economic recovery, the overall economy remains deeply damaged. Therefore, it is essential to approach the recovery process cautiously and with balance. Even a small mistake can cause significant disruptions to the economy. Therefore, the Customs Department must work collectively to achieve its targeted revenue of Rs. 2,550 billion. A proposal has been submitted to improve facilities for Customs and establish a new salary structure. Discussions are underway with the Ministry of Finance and the Treasury to provide solutions. This years budget has already addressed the increase in the basic salaries of public sector employees. Additionally, plans are in place to enhance the efficiency of the public service by integrating digitalization and technology. Efforts are also being made to implement legal reforms to build strong institutional frameworks. There were conflicts between previous political administrations and the state service mechanism. Due to these disagreements, the political leadership failed to implement the necessary reforms to strengthen institutional frameworks at the right time. It was a challenging period to establish robust institutional structures. The failure to introduce timely institutional changes resulted in the expected outcomes not being achieved. Consequently, before we could secure many opportunities for ourselves, external parties took advantage of our resources. As a result, Sri Lanka missed several opportunities to leverage its natural strategic position as a nation. In the future, necessary measures must be taken to facilitate operations at the Sri Lanka Port, targeting a capacity of 11.3 million containers. Achieving this will require collective effort from all employees. Without such unity, the country cannot move forward. This year, the Customs Department has been assigned a revenue target of LKR 2,550 billion. President Anura Kumara Disanayake presented merit certificates issued by the World Customs Organization to 20 Customs officers in recognition of their outstanding contributions to special operations. Additionally, two officers were honoured with skills awards during the event. The Director General of Customs also presented a commemorative plaque to President Anura Kumara Disanayake to mark the occasion, the statement added. The event was attended by key dignitaries, including Minister of Labour and Deputy Minister of Economic Development Dr. Anil Jayantha Fernando, Governor of the Central Bank Dr. Nandalal Weerasinghe, Deputy Minister of Finance and Planning Harshana Suriyapperuma, Attorney General Parinda Ranasinghe, Secretary to the President Dr. Nandika Sanath Kumanayake, Secretary to the Ministry of Finance Mahinda Siriwardena, Director General of Customs Sarath Nonis, and other officials from the Customs Department. --PMD--",

        "title": "Tech stock selloff deepens as DeepSeek triggers AI rethink",
        "date": "January 28, 2025 11:53 am",
        "content": "Japanese technology shares fell on Tuesday as a global market rout sparked by the emergence of a low-cost Chinese artificial intelligence model entered day two, with investors questioning the sky-high valuation and dominance of AI bellwethers. Shares of Nvidia the poster child of the AI boom in recent years, dragged U.S. stocks lower, sinking 17 on Monday and wiping 593 billion from the chipmakers market value, a record one-day loss for any company. It all stemmed from a free AI assistant launched by Chinese startup DeepSeek last week that the firm said uses less data at a fraction of the cost of services available currently, garnering significant attention worldwide including from OpenAI CEO Sam Altman who called it an impressive model. We will obviously deliver much better models and also its legit invigorating to have a new competitor!, Altman, the head of the AI firm behind ChatGPT, said in a social media post. The launch and increasing popularity of DeepSeek spurred investors to dump tech stocks globally, with ripples felt from Tokyo to Amsterdam to Silicon Valley. In Japan, chip-testing equipment maker Advantest a supplier to Nvidia lost 10 on Tuesday after diving nearly 9 on Monday. Chip-making equipment maker Tokyo Electron fell 5.3, while technology start-up investor SoftBank Group was 6 lower. Over in the U.S., Broadcom (finished down 17.4, followed by ChatGPT backer Microsoft which fell 2.1 and then Google parent Alphabet which ended down 4.2. The Philadelphia semiconductor index tumbled 9.2, for its deepest percentage drop since March 2020. Tech heavy South Korean and Taiwan markets are closed for Lunar New Year. The selloff has brought into the spotlight the crowded positioning among investors as well as the extremely high valuation of some of these firms. What makes Mondays tech selloff so jarring is that the valuations of many of these AI and tech companies offer no margin of error, said David Bahnsen, chief investment officer at The Bahnsen Group. The excessive weighting these tech stocks have in many investor portfolios and the high concentration these tech stocks have in the market indices was a significant and under-appreciated risk issue. The hype around AI has powered a huge flow of capital into equities in the last 18 months, inflating valuations and lifting stock markets to record highs. It is not just the chipmakers and tech companies but companies focused on datacentres also taking a hit, with Malaysias utility conglomerate YTL Power down 7.5 on Tuesday, its third session of steep loss. Jun Rong Yeap, market strategist at IG, said there may be some sell first, think later thinking at play, with opinions divided on whether DeepSeek will eventually be the so-called game-changer that reshapes the U.S. AI landscape. But if anything, market participants dislike uncertainties and are clearly unwilling to take the risks in the near term. Little is known about the Hangzhou startup behind DeepSeek, whose controlling shareholder is Liang Wenfeng, co-founder of quantitative hedge fund High-Flyer, records showed. Its researchers wrote in a paper last month that DeepSeek-V3 model, launched on Jan. 10, used Nvidias lower-capability H800 chips for training, at a cost of less than 6 million. Charu Chanana, chief investment strategist at Saxo, said the development serves as a reminder that competition in the global AI arena is intensifying and Nvidia may not be in pole position forever. By developing cutting-edge AI models with less advanced and more cost-efficient hardware, DeepSeek challenges the heavy investments U.S. tech companies are pouring into high-cost AI infrastructure. Investor focus will now be on the flurry of tech earnings this week, with executives likely keen to calm frayed nerves. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "title": "Johann Peries becomes first Sri Lankan to summit Antarcticas highest mountain",
        "date": "January 28, 2025 01:17 pm",
        "content": "Johann Peries has reached the summit of Mount Vinson, the highest mountain in Antarctica at 4,892 metres, to become the first Sri Lankan and one of the few islanders in the world to achieve this incredible feat. In 2018, Johann Peries made history as the second Sri Lankan to summit Mount Everest, a monumental achievement that solidified his place in the countrys mountaineering legacy. His extraordinary journey continued as he completed the summits of Mount Elbrus in Europe, Mount Kilimanjaro in Africa, and Mount Kosciuszko in Australia. No Sri Lankan has ever completed the Seven Summits challenge, and only 350 people worldwide have done so. Johanns mountaineering journey has not been without its challenges. In 2016, he attempted to summit Mount Everest with fellow Sri Lankan climber Jayanthi Kuru Uthumpala. While Jayanthi succeeded, Johann faced technical difficulties and had to turn back just 400 meters from the summit. Two years later, Johann returned to Everest, overcoming those challenges and successfully summited in 2018. Johanns journey has also seen him face extreme conditions on some of the worlds most dangerous mountains, including Mount Kilimanjaro (2014), Mount Aconcagua (2019), Mount Elbrus (2023), and Mount Denali (2023). In these expeditions, he has faced bad weather, tough terrain, and life-threatening situations. On Mount Denali, he was forced to turn back on the final day due to severe weather conditions. In February 2025, Johann will attempt Aconcagua again, and he plans to return to Denali in May 2025, undeterred by the setbacks he has faced. Johanns remarkable accomplishments are more than just a series of personal milestones. His efforts are helping to elevate Sri Lankas presence in the global mountaineering community and encouraging a new generation of climbers to pursue the sport. Mountaineering is a challenging and expensive sport, requiring discipline, intense physical and mental endurance, and substantial training. Johann has personally faced numerous life-threatening situations, witnessing the dangers of the sport firsthand. However, his resilience and determination to push forward have been unwavering. Mountaineering is not for the faint-hearted. It requires immense focus, training, and the ability to endure physical and mental hardship, Johann reflected. But the rewards are immense. I want to inspire all Sri Lankans to take on their own challenges, whether on the mountain or in life.",

He also mentioned that the problem with red raw rice will be resolved once the harvesting for this cultivation season begins, and that the government expects the red raw rice issue to be addressed in about two weeks. Commenting further in this regard he added: We hope to harvest 700,000 metric tons of red raw rice this season. We have found a solution to the Nadu rice problem and are providing a systematic solution.

        "content": "Cabinet Spokesman, Minister Dr. Nalinda Jayatissa says that steps will be taken to establish a guaranteed price for paddy purchase as soon as market prices begin to decline. Speaking during the Cabinet press conference held today (28), the Minister emphasized that at present, it is more beneficial for farmers to sell their paddy to the private sector rather than to the government. The benefit for farmers at this moment is not to supply paddy to the government but to sell it to private buyers who process it into rice and release it to the market. However, after large-scale paddy purchases, the government must maintain a stock to manage supply. We are intervening by repairing paddy warehouses, and the government has allocated funds for paddy purchases. However, the government cannot and should not do that. Many small and medium-scale entrepreneurs in our country are engaged in the paddy market. Our objective is to intervene in a way that benefits both farmers and consumers while maintaining price stability. Our intervention should neither be unfair to farmers nor burdensome to consumers. There is no intention to remove the rice price control, and we plan to introduce a minimum guaranteed price for paddy accordingly, the Minister expressed. As the Deputy Minister mentioned, the government will announce guaranteed prices as soon as it observes a decline in paddy prices in the market. There is no need for concern at this time, he added.",

        "date": "January 28, 2025 03:31 pm",
        "content": "India, on Tuesday, lodged a strong protest with Sri Lanka over an incident of firing by the Sri Lankan Navy during the apprehension of 13 Indian fishermen in the proximity of Delft Island in the early hours of this morning. The Indian Ministry of External Affairs said Sri Lankas acting High Commissioner was called in to the foreign office to lodge the protest. Our High Commission in Colombo has also raised the matter with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Sri Lankan government, the Indian Ministry of External Affairs said. In the incident, out of the 13 fishermen who were on board the fishing vessel, two sustained serious injuries and are currently receiving treatment at the Jaffna Teaching Hospital. Three other fishermen received minor injuries and have been treated for the same. Indian Consulate Officials in Jaffna have visited the injured fishermen at the hospital to seek their welfare and are extending all possible assistance to the fishermen and their families. The Government of India has always emphasised the need to treat issues pertaining to fishermen in a humane and humanitarian manner, keeping in mind livelihood concerns. The use of force is not acceptable under any circumstances whatsoever. Existing understandings between the two Governments in this regard must be strictly observed, the MEA said. Meanwhile, the Sri Lanka Navy has issued a statement regarding the incident in question stating that the Northern Naval Command observed a cluster of Indian fishing boats poaching in the Sri Lankan waters off Valvettithurai, Jaffna in the dark hours of Monday (27 Jan). Subsequently, the Northern Naval Command mounted a special operation to send away those fishing boats from the island waters, deploying naval craft, it said. During this operation, the Navy seized an Indian fishing boat continued to remain in Sri Lankan waters, while marshalling illegal fishing activities and collecting the fishing harvest. The operation also led to the apprehension of 13 Indian fishermen aboard the fishing boat. The Sri Lanka Navy said its boarding team was compelled to conduct noncompliance boarding as the Indian fishing boat continued to maneuver aggressively, without complying with the Navys lawful orders and its duty, during the process of taking the boat into custody. On this occasion, the Indian fishermen have acted aggressively, maneuvering their fishing boat in a hostile manner and behaving confrontationally with the Navy. However, while boarding the fishing boat, in accordance with the authority vested in the Navy, the Indian fishermen, as an organized group, have attempted to assault naval personnel and made an attempt to snatch a firearm from a naval officer, endangering the lives of the naval personnel. In the process, an accidental fire has taken place, causing slight injuries to two Indian fishermen, the SLN said. Following the incident, the Navy provided initial first aid to the two injured fishermen and promptly transferred them to the Jaffna Teaching Hospital for further treatment. The hospital has confirmed that their condition is stable. Meanwhile, the Navy has lodged a complaint with the Kankesanthurai Police regarding the incident. The seized Indian fishing boat and remaining fishermen have been brought to the Kankasanthurai harbour this morning and they will be handed over to the Mailadi Fisheries Inspector for onward legal action, the statement said. --Agencies",

This decision aims to ensure that the funds benefits reach the grassroots level, providing greater relief and support to underserved communities, the Presidents Media Division (PMD) stated. One of the key topics discussed was the issue of surgical delays in government hospitals. To address this, the council proposed facilitating surgeries outside regular working hours and offering incentives to medical staff involved in these after-hours procedures, with funding provided by the Presidents Fund. Currently, this initiative is operational at the Karapitiya Teaching Hospital, and plans are underway to expand it to the National Hospital in Colombo, the Kandy General Hospital, and the Lady Ridgeway Childrens Hospital. These measures are designed to provide faster and more efficient healthcare services to patients, the statement said. The council also explored the possibility of broadening educational support for students. It emphasized the need to launch new programs targeting children preparing for the G.C.E. Ordinary Level and Advanced Level examinations while continuing and expanding existing initiatives.

        "date": "January 28, 2025 06:14 pm",
        "content": "Dead bodies lay in the streets, gunfire rang out and hospitals were overwhelmed in east Congos largest city on Tuesday, as M23 rebels backed by Rwanda faced pockets of resistance from army and pro-government militias. A day after the rebels marched into the lakeside city, protesters in the capital attacked a U.N. compound and embassies including those of Rwanda, France and the United States, expressing anger at what they said was foreign interference. M23 fighters entered Goma on Monday in the worst escalation since 2012 of a three-decade conflict rooted in the long fallout from the Rwandan genocide and control of Congos abundant mineral resources. The Congolese government and the head of U.N. peacekeeping have said Rwandan troops were present in Goma, backing up their M23 allies. Rwanda has said it was adopting a defensive posture because of the threat posed to it by Congolese militias. Dozens of Democratic Republic of Congo troops had surrendered, but some soldiers and pro-government militiamen were holding out, residents and U.N. sources said. People in several neighbourhoods reported small arms fire and some loud explosions on Tuesday morning. I have heard the crackle of gunfire from midnight until now ... it is coming from near the airport, an elderly woman in Gomas northern Majengo neighbourhood, close to the airport, told Reuters by phone. Jens Laerke, spokesperson for the U.N. humanitarian office (OCHA), told a briefing in Geneva colleagues had reported heavy small arms fire and mortar fire across the city and the presence of many dead bodies in the streets. We have reports of rapes committed by fighters, looting of property ... and humanitarian health facilities being hit, he added. Other international aid officials described hospitals overwhelmed with wounded being treated in hallways. The town is a powderkeg, Willy Ngumbi, a bishop in Goma, said. Explosives had hit a house where priests were staying and the maternity ward of a Catholic hospital on Monday, he said by phone. The youth are armed and the fighting is now taking place in the town. Fear of Spiral The U.N. and global powers fear the conflict could spiral into a regional war akin to those of 1996-1997 and 1998-2003 that killed millions, mostly from hunger and disease. Corneille Nangaa, leader of the Congo River Alliance that includes the M23, has suggested the rebels aim is to replace President Felix Tshisekedi and his government in the capital 1,600 km (1,000 miles) away. In Kinshasa, angry crowds burned tyres, chanted anti-Rwanda slogans and attacked diplomatic installations of several countries seen as favourable to Rwanda, leading the police to fire tear gas. A European diplomatic source said the Rwandan, French, U.S., Ugandan and Kenyan embassies had been targeted. What Rwanda is doing is with the complicity of France, the U.S. and Belgium. The Congolese people are fed up. How many times to we have to die? said protester Joseph Ngoy. The United Nations has been caught up in the fighting with a peacekeeping force. South Africa said three of its peacekeepers were killed in a crossfire between government troops and rebels and a fourth had succumbed to wounds from earlier fighting, bringing the number of its fatalities in the past week to 13. It said President Cyril Ramaphosa had spoken by phone to Rwandan President Paul Kagame, and the two had agreed on the need for a ceasefire. On Monday, Rwandas army reported five people killed and 26 injured in exchanges of fire with Congolese troops near the border. The fighting has sent thousands of people streaming out of Goma, a regional hub for humanitarian aid for displaced people. Hundreds of thousands have fled fighting since the start of the year, on top of 3 million displaced in eastern Congo last year. Fast Offensive M23 is the latest in a string of ethnic Tutsi-led, Rwandan-backed insurgencies that have brought tumult to Congo since the aftermath of the genocide in Rwanda thirty years ago, when Hutu extremists killed Tutsis and moderate Hutus, and then were toppled by the Tutsi-led forces that still dominate Rwanda. M23 fighters took up arms again in 2022, a decade after a previous insurgency that briefly captured Goma. In recent weeks they made swift gains through North Kivu province on the border with Rwanda, ignoring calls from world leaders to halt their offensive. Rwanda has dismissed calls for troops to leave, saying its security is threatened by ethnic Hutu militias, some with links to the extremists who murdered close to 1 million people during the 1994 genocide. U.N experts say Kigali has deployed 3,000-4,000 troops in eastern Congo to support the M23. Congos government has called on international powers to pressure Rwanda, potentially via sanctions, to end the M23 offensive. In a phone call with Congo president Tshisekedi on Monday, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio condemned the assault on Goma by the Rwanda-backed M23 and affirmed the United States respect for the sovereignty of the DRC, the State Department said. The U.N. Security Council was due to discuss the crisis again on Tuesday, diplomats said. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "content": "It was revealed today (28) that Sri Lanka Customs has imposed taxes on the stock of dates donated by Saudi Arabia as a gift for the Ramadan fasting season. This information came to light during a media inquiry at the Cabinet press conference held earlier today. Cabinet Spokesman, Minister Nalinda Jayatissa, stated that the government plans to relax taxes on dates during the Ramadan fasting season. The Minister further confirmed that a Cabinet decision had been taken in this regard. However, Minister Jayatissa clarified that as the date stock was received prior to the announcement of the tax relief, taxes had in fact been levied on it. Efforts are now being made to provide the necessary relief, he said. It was also disclosed that Sri Lanka Customs had imposed taxes amounting to Rs. 33 million on the 50 metric tons of dates donated by Saudi Arabia.",

Speaking further on this matter, he added, We are not viewing these enterprises from the old perspective. We are ready to make structural changes. In particular, we are currently studying whether it is possible to merge these enterprises and issue a certain number of shares on the stock market through a holdings company. We are also ready to reconsider about corporations and boards. He continued, I will be frank, there are some enterprises, and several of them are performing the same functions. I think we will have to close some of them, merge others, and in some cases, the scope of certain enterprises will have to be changed. We are currently proceeding with the identification of these.",

        "title": "Serbian prime minister quits as anti-corruption protests persist",
        "date": "January 28, 2025 10:18 pm",
        "content": "Serbian Prime Minister Milos Vucevic resigned on Tuesday, becoming the highest-ranking official to step down amid a wave of anti-corruption protests that have spread across the Balkan country. The anti-government demonstrations sprang up in the wake of the roof collapsing at a railway station in the city of Novi Sad, killing 15 people and leading to calls for Vucevic to quit. What began as small gatherings in Novi Sad have ballooned and spread to the capital Belgrade as students, teachers and other workers have turned out in their thousands to blame the station disaster on corruption within the government of President Aleksandar Vucic. The minister for construction, transportation and infrastructure, and the trade minister have already stepped down because of the incident, but that failed to quell the protests. I opted for this step in order to defuse tensions, Vucevic told a news conference on Tuesday, announcing his resignation. He said the mayor of Novi Sad would also resign. With this we have met all demands of the most radical protesters. The focus for many analysts now is how much this will affect the president, whose party easily won a snap election in 2023 but who has come under increasing pressure. Opposition parties and rights watchdogs accuse him and the SNS of bribing voters, stifling media freedom, violence against opponents, corruption and ties with organised crime. Vucic and his allies deny these allegations. Mario Bikarski, senior Europe analyst at risk consultancy Verisk Maplecroft, did not expect Vucic to be forced out, in part because of a lack of trusted and viable political alternatives. But he expected the protests to continue. The governments hesitation to accede to the protestors demands has eroded trust in state institutions and the political leadership, Bikarski said. Serbia will likely remain a hotbed for unrest. Strategic Player Vucic is also seen as a strategic player on the international stage in view of Serbias historic ties with Russia and the West. Serbia is a candidate to join the European Union, although it must normalise relations with its neighbour and former province Kosovo. The opposition Kreni-Promeni party has called for an interim government made up of experts approved by students who have led the protests. It has urged other opposition parties not to boycott elections if they are held. The protests, which included students putting up a blockade at a main junction in Belgrade this week, have been largely peaceful. But three protesters in Novi Sad were attacked on Monday and blamed members of Vucics Serbian Progressive Party (SNS). A young woman sustained head injuries and was hospitalised. The police detained four people over the incident, the prosecutors office in Novi Sad said in a statement. Thousands of students gathered in Novi Sad on Tuesday afternoon to protest against the beating of their colleagues. Those who have been fuelling tensions for the past 13 years are now trying to defuse tensions, Lazar Stojakovic of the Faculty for Organisational Science at Belgrade University posted on X. It is not going to work, you were beating us, running us over (with cars), you beat up our colleagues in Novi Sad, See you in the street again. Vucic was expected to address the nation at 2000 local time (1900 GMT). Source: Reuters --Agencies",
