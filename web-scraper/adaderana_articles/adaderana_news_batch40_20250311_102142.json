In a post on X (formerly Twitter), the former Deputy Minister said they campaigned hard for SJBs presidential candidate Sajith Premadasa, and that however it was not to be. It is now clear Anura Kumara Dissanayake will be the new President of SriLanka. Dr. de Silva stated that in the spirit of democracy and goodwill he called and wished Dissanayake the best in the arduous road ahead. Meanwhile, Sri Lankas Foreign Minister Ali Sabry has also extended his best wishes to NPP candidate Dissanayake. In a post on X (formerly Twitter), he said the following; After a long and arduous campaign, the results of the election are now clear. Though I heavily campaigned for President Ranil Wickremasinghe, the people of Sri Lanka have made their decision, and I fully respect their mandate for Anura Kumara Dissanayake. In a democracy, it is crucial to honor the will of the people, and I do so without hesitation. I extend my sincere congratulations to Mr. Dissanayake and his team. Leading a country is no easy task, and I genuinely hope that their leadership brings Sri Lanka the peace, prosperity, and stability it so deeply deserves. The challenges they will face are immense, and I trust they will reflect on the lessons of the pastboth the successes and failures of those who have held power before them. History teaches us that the real challenge is not in winning an election, but in governing wisely and staying true to the needs of the people. Too often, those who have won elections in the past lost sight of the promises they made and missed the opportunity to bring real change. I hope Mr. Dissanayake and his team learn from these past mistakes and lead with a commitment to transparency, integrity, and the long-term good of the country. I wish Mr. Dissanayake and his team every success in their efforts to lead Sri Lanka forward.",

Mr. Ratnayake stated that accordingly, all the other candidates except for the National Peoples Power (NPP) candidate Anura Kumara Dissanayake and Samagi Jana Sandhanaya candidate Sajith Premadasa will be disqualified from the race. The Election Commission Chairman announced this during a special media briefing on Sunday (22). Furthermore, he expressed that since no candidate has obtained the required percentage of votes at the first count, the preference for the two leading candidates Anura Kumara Dissanayake and Sajith Premadasa among the other ballot papers will be counted for a final decision. Under Sri Lankas electoral rules, voters can rank second and third-choice candidates. If no candidate receives more than 50 per cent, those second-preference votes are added to the tally of the two leading candidates to determine a winner.

The election commission formally announced on Sunday (September 22) NPP leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake as the winner of the 2024 Presidential Election. The commission said on its website that Mr. Dissanayake, 55, won the presidency with 42.31 of the vote at Saturdays (September 21) election, pushing opposition leader Sajith Premadasa to second place and incumbent Ranil Wickremesinghe to a distant third. It was a strong showing for Dissanayake, who won just over 3 of votes in a previous presidential election in 2019, and suggests voters are fatigued with the old political guard, which has been accused of pushing Sri Lanka toward economic instability. Mr. Dissanayake is due to be sworn in on Monday (September 23), according to unconfirmed repors. In a post on X (formerly Twitter) after the release of results concluded, Dissanayake said: The dream we have nurtured for centuries is finally coming true. This achievement is not the result of any single persons work, but the collective effort of hundreds of thousands of you. Your commitment has brought us this far, and for that, I am deeply grateful. This victory belongs to all of us. Our journey here has been paved by the sacrifices of so many who gave their sweat, tears, and even their lives for this cause. Their sacrifices are not forgotten. We hold the scepter of their hopes and struggles, knowing the responsibility it carries. The millions of eyes filled with hope and expectation push us forward, and together, we stand ready to rewrite Sri Lankan history. This dream can only be realized with a fresh start. The unity of Sinhalese, Tamils, Muslims, and all Sri Lankans is the bedrock of this new beginning. The New Renaissance we seek will rise from this shared strength and vision. Let us join hands and shape this future together!, he said. A record 38 contenders vied for Sri Lankas presidency in Saturdays vote. For the first time in the countrys history, election officials counted the second-preference votes after no candidate secured 50 percent. The election commission made the announcement after a second vote count, the first in the countrys history. Opposition leader Sajith Premadasa finished second while incumbent President Ranil Wickremesinghe came third and was eliminated after the first round. 56-year-old Anura Kumar Dissanayake was elected to the office of the president after winning almost eight million votes. The Marxist Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) leaders campaign was built on sweeping reforms, tackling corruption and ensuring economic relief. In short, Dissanayake offered a political revolution through the ballot. Dissanayake hails from Thambuttegama, in the North Central District of Anuradhapura. In his own words, an aspirational youth who wanted to change the world. The son of working class parents as he describes himself, Dissanayake attended two public schools in his hometown, and was the first student from Thambuttegama to enter university. His involvement with student politics saw him join the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) in 1987 and soon he was fully absorbed in JVP politics. Dissanayake entered the University of Peradeniya but had to leave as threats mounted. In 1992, he got himself transferred to the University of Kelaniya and graduated in 1995 with a Bachelor of Science degree. Dissanayake has been steadfast in his criticism of cronyism, nepotism, concentration of power and corruption. In parliament and outside, Dissanayake has been a strong anti-corruption voice demanding accountability. His promise to overhaul the system, end family rule, introduce financial reforms and improve governance structures resonated with the protesting masses. --WIth Agencies Inputs",

        "content": "In a special address, President Ranil Wickremesinghe expressed his deep gratitude to the people of Sri Lanka for the mandate granted during the 21st presidential election. He acknowledged that, in accordance with the will of the people, the leadership of the country should now be passed on to President Anura Dissanayake. President Wickremesinghe extended his sincere thanks to all those who supported him during his tenure. He reflected on his role as a caretaker, stating that he had guided the beloved child of Sri Lanka across significant challenges, symbolized by the Vine Bridge, and expressed his confidence that under President Dissanayakes leadership, the journey will continue safely and successfully. The full transcript of President Ranil Wickremesinghes speech is shown below; Ayubowan! Dear Citizens, The people of the country have given their decision at this Presidential Election held on 21st September 2024. Therefore, we must respect their decision and act according to that mandate to ensure the functioning of the country. Two years ago, I took over a bankrupt country and a collapsed economy at an extremely turbulent time. I accepted the challenge at a time when no one else had the courage to face it. I successfully completed the responsibility that history put upon my shoulders. I was able to rescue my motherland from bankruptcy within a short period of two years. I believe this to be the most important thing I could do for my country during my political career. Inflation was 70 when I took over the country, but I could reduce it to 0.5 during my time as the President. I increased the Foreign Reserve, which was at USD 20 Million when I came to power, to USD 5.7 Billion. I was able to ensure that the Sri Lankan Rupee which was 380 against the US Dollar, came down to a strong and solid amount of 300. Also, when I took over, the economic growth of the country was negative 7.3 (- 7.3). But I was able to increase it to positive 2.3 (2.3). I am happy and proud about it. I believe that the future generation of the country will give the proper assessment for my historical political role, the way it deserves. I am aware that my place in history as the ruler of this country will be decided not today, but in future. I followed the right path and saved people from hunger and sorrow. I hope that the new President will also follow the right path and put an end to the remaining issues that the people are facing. I was eventually able to carry the dear child called Sri Lanka along a long distance safely  on the dangerous rope bridge. Close to the very end of the rope bridge, people have decided to handover the dear child called Sri Lanka to President Anura Dissanayake. Mr. President, here I handover to you with much love, the dear child called Sri Lanka, whom we both love very dearly. I wish that you will be able to carry this child away from the bridge to the other bank, even safer than the way I carried the child. I will be devoted to serving my motherland with or without power, with or without a post or powers, for the rest of my life. I wish to thank everyone who supported me, who did not support me, and all the citizens of the country during my time as President. Thank you.",

        "content": "Anura Kumara Dissanayake has been sworn in as the 9th Executive of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka, a short while ago. He was ceremonially sworn in as the countrys new President before Chief Justice Jayantha Jayasuriya at the Presidential Secretariat in Colombo. The swearing in ceremony commenced following Dissanayakes arrival at the Presidential Secretariat with a large number of party supporters and well-wishers gathered outside to welcome him. After taking oath as the new President in a simple ceremony, Dissanayake delivered a brief statement emphasizing his commitment to the nation and the citizens of Sri Lanka. The Election Commission declared 56-year-old Anura Kumara Dissanayake the winner last night after the second round of counting. Dissanayake created history on Sunday by winning the Sri Lankan presidential election. Sri Lankas Election Commission declared him the winner after the second round of counting. Dissanayake defeated Sajith Premadasa of Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB), his closest rival. In the presidential election held on Saturday, no candidate got more than the required 50 votes in the first round of counting. Due to this, the Election Commission ordered a second round of counting, in which National Peoples Power (NPP) leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake won. Popularly known as AKD in Sri Lanka, Dissanayake became Sri Lankas first President elected in a run-off. His party Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) was on the margins for a long time, but this victory has given a new identity to the party. The rise of the party under Dissanayakes leadership has been based on demands for anti-corruption and change in political culture. Dissanayake hails from rural Thambuttegama in the North Central Province and holds a Bachelor of Science degree from the University of Kelaniya in suburban Colombo. He joined the JVP (Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna) in 1987, when the anti-Indian insurgency was at its peak. Throughout his political career, he has fought against corruption and for peoples rights. Anura Kumara Dissanayakes victory represents a major shift in Sri Lankas political landscape. His rise to the presidency, especially at a time of economic and political challenges in the country, shows that the public is looking for a new leadership style and political vision.",

        "content": "The newly elected President Anura Kumara Dissanayake, in his inaugural address to the nation after sworn-in as the Head of the State, assured his full commitment to strengthen and safeguard the democracy of the country, through which he was elected to the office. Addressing the nation, President Dissanayake said: The most significant feature of our countrys democracy is the election of the ruler of the country by the general public, but the democracy is not all about just casting the votes or electing the ruler. We accept that we need a little more strengthening of the structures and strong legislations. Therefore, at first, I assure the public that I am ready to showcase my maximum commitment for the protection of the democracy in the country during my term as the president. Furthermore, he expressed his gratitude to the outgoing President Ranil Wickremesinghe for cordially welcoming the mandate of the public and showcasing dedication to the changeover of the power respecting the democracy. He also reminded that no leader of the countrys history has refused to accept the transfer of power, as decided by the mandate of the public. Commenting further, the new Executive President stated: We have deeply understood that we are taking over a very challenging country. There is the need for creating a favourable political culture in the country, which the public expect from us. Were ready to commit for that. We will do every possible thing from our side for re-assuring the confidence of the public in the politics and the politician. Next, we do not think that the deep crisis situation that were taking over can be navigated by a single person, the government or just by a single party. I have stated earlier as well, that I am not a magician, but a normal citizen born in this very country. There are abilities and things we know. But my priority is to extract more abilities, collect more knowledge in order to guide the country with better decisions. My responsibility is to be a part of that collective triumph, Dissanayake added. Meanwhile, the newly elected President also commented on his expectations of working together with the international communities for the sake of the country. I also expect the support of each and every citizen for ending the crisis. But I will always assure the public that I, as the President complete my responsibility with commitment, for that purpose. I know we need the international support. Therefore, we expect to work together with other nations in a way that is more beneficial to our country, despite the divisions of power. We must not be left alone from the world, but a country that should move forward combined with the other countries of the world. We will not hesitate to take decisions required for that purpose, he expressed. We also expect the much needed support of the industrialists and the entrepreneurs of the country, said President Dissanayake. Finally, I must say that, I was elected by the democracy of the country. The people have voted me. There are people who did not vote me. We have a clear understanding of the amount and the composition of our victory. My responsibility within this term is to build the confidence in that part of the public who do not believe in us. I firmly believe that I will succeed in that purpose, Dissanayake signed off.",

        "date": "September 23, 2024 03:04 pm",
        "content": "Chinese President Xi Jinping on Monday said he hoped to broaden cooperation with Sri Lanka under his Belt and Road infrastructure initiative (BRI) as he congratulated the island nations new leader Anura Kumara Dissanayaka. Dissanayaka took his oath at the Presidential Secretariat in Colombo on Monday, vowing to restore public faith in politics. The country is emerging from a years-long economic collapse blamed partly on struggling high-debt Chinese mega-projects coordinated through the BRI, the massive infrastructure project that is a central pillar of Xis bid to expand his countrys clout overseas. I attach great importance to the development of China-Sri Lanka relations and am willing to work with Mr. President to continue our traditional friendship (and) enhance mutual political trust, Xi said in a message to Dissanayaka, according to state broadcaster CCTV. Xi said he hoped bilateral cooperation under his flagship BRI would bear more fruit, CCTV added. He said Beijing would promote the steady progress of sincere mutual assistance between China and Sri Lanka as well as our age-old strategic cooperative partnership, and create more benefits for the peoples of both countries. Western critics accuse China of using the BRI to enmesh developing nations in unsustainable debt to exert diplomatic leverage over them or even seize their assets. But a chorus of leaders -- as well as research by leading global think tanks like Londons Chatham House -- have refuted the debt trap theory. In December 2017, unable to repay a huge Chinese loan, Sri Lanka handed its Hambantota port in the south of the island to a Beijing company on a 99-year lease for 1.12 billion. And the country defaulted on its foreign borrowings in 2022 during a crisis that caused months of food, fuel and medicine shortages. China is the nations largest bilateral creditor, its loans accounting for 4.66 billion of the 10.58 billion that Sri Lanka has borrowed from other countries. Last year, the International Monetary Fund -- the international lender of last resort -- approved a 2.9 billion bailout loan for Sri Lanka. Beijing also agreed to restructure its loans to the country. And this month, Sri Lanka secured a deal with international bondholders to finalise a prolonged debt restructuring.

        "date": "September 23, 2024 05:50 pm",
        "content": "Israel unleashed its most widespread wave of airstrikes against hundreds of Hezbollah targets on Monday, killing at least 100 people by Lebanese tallies, and warned citizens to evacuate areas where it said the armed group was storing weapons. Israel deepened its attacks after some of the heaviest cross-border exchanges of fire in almost a year of conflict, as Israel shifts its focus to its northern border, where Hezbollah has been firing rockets into Israel in support of its ally Hamas which is fighting a war with Israel in Gaza. We are deepening our attacks in Lebanon, the actions will continue until we achieve our goal to return the northern residents safely to their homes, Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said in a video published by his office on Monday. These are days in which the Israeli public will have to show composure. He was speaking after the Israeli military targeted Iran-backed Hezbollah in Lebanons south, eastern Bekaa valley and northern region near Syria. Lebanons health ministry said at least 100 people had been killed, including women, children and medics, and more than 400 wounded in Israels strikes on Monday. Israeli army spokesperson Avichay Adraee said on X that more than 300 Hezbollah targets had been struck so far after earlier warning that airstrikes were imminent on houses in Lebanon where Hezbollah hid weapons. In response, Hezbollah said it had launched rockets at Israeli military posts. The airstrikes have intensified pressure on Hezbollah, which last week suffered an attack its Secretary General Hassan Nasrallah called unprecedented in the history of the group, after thousands of pagers and walkie-talkies used by its members exploded. The operation was widely blamed on Israel, which has not confirmed or denied responsibility. In another major blow, an Israeli airstrike on Beiruts southern suburb on Friday targeted senior Hezbollah commanders, killing 45 people, according to the Lebanese health ministry. Hezbollah said 16 members of the group were among the dead, including senior leader Ibrahim Aqil and another commander, Ahmed Wahbi. One person was slightly hurt by shrapnel from the latest rocket barrage at northern Israel, according to the Israeli ambulance service. Imad Kreidieh, the head of Lebanese telecoms company Ogero, told Reuters on Monday that more than 80,000 automated calls asking people to evacuate their areas were detected on the network. Not all were answered. Such calls were psychological warfare to make havoc and chaos, he added. On Monday, residents of southern Lebanon received calls from a Lebanese number ordering them to immediately distance themselves 1,000 metres (0.6 mile) from any post used by Hezbollah, a Reuters reporter in the south, who received the call, said. PSYCHOLOGICAL WAR Lebanons information minister Ziad Makary said his ministry had received a call ordering the building to evacuate, but said the ministry would do no such thing. This is a psychological war, Makary told Reuters. In the eastern Beirut district of Sassine, state employee Joseph Ghafary said he feared that Hezbollah would respond to Israels intensified strikes and that a full-blown war would break out. If Hezbollah carries out a major operation, Israel will respond and destroy more than this. We cant bear it, he said. Israel wants to strike, it wants to keep going, meaning it is squeezing Sayyed Hassan (Nasrallah) to start a war. It is definitely dangerous. Mohammed Sibai, a shopowner in the Beirut neighbourhood of Hamra, told Reuters that he saw the escalation in strikes as the beginning of the war. If they want war, what can we do? It was imposed on us. We cannot do anything, he said. In a televised statement earlier, the Israeli military spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said the evacuation warning was being distributed in Arabic on all networks and platforms in Lebanon. Asked by reporters about a possible Israeli ground incursion into Lebanon, Hagari said we will do whatever is needed in order to return evacuated residents of northern Israel to their homes safely, a war priority for the Israeli government. Hagari presented in a media briefing an aerial video of what he described as Hezbollah operatives trying to launch cruise missiles from a civilian house in Lebanon, and the subsequent Israeli strike moments before it was launched. Hezbollah is endangering you. Endangering you and your families, Hagari said. LOW FLYING WARPLANES Israeli warplanes carried out an intense wave of air strikes on towns along Lebanons southern border and even further north on Monday morning, according to Reuters witnesses. A rocket hit an uninhabited mountainside east of the Lebanese port city of Byblos on Monday, a resident and Lebanese state media said, in an area that has not previously been hit by airstrikes. The area falls between Christian and Shiite villages. Reuters reporters in the southern port city of Tyre could hear warplanes flying low over southern Lebanon and hear a series of airstrikes nearby. Warplanes also carried out airstrikes on the Hermel area in northern Lebanon, Hezbollahs al-Manar reported. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "date": "September 23, 2024 07:12 pm",
        "content": "Sri Lankas dollar bonds slid as leftist candidate Anura Kumara Dissanayakes victory at the presidential election put the nations bailout by the International Monetary Fund and debt deals at peril, the Bloomberg reported. Bonds maturing in March 2029 declined 3.1 cents, the biggest drop in about two years, to 50.2 cents on the dollar on Monday. The SP Sri Lanka 20 Index of blue-chip stocks reversed intraday losses to trade 2.2 higher. The rupee gained as Dissanayake said the island nation needs international support and his government will work with all. He had earlier vowed to reopen negotiations with the IMF over its 3 billion bailout, which comes with spending cuts and tax hikes that proved deeply unpopular with voters. A Dissanayake win is the worst possible outcome for Sri Lankas bonds, Tellimer strategists Hasnain Malik and Patrick Curran wrote in a note Sunday. Sri Lankas 2029 dollar notes are set for a nearly 15 slide this quarter, a spectacular turnaround after handing investors a return of close to 70 last year, one of the best in emerging markets. It raises question marks not only for the IMF program but also whether a new administration would honor the agreement reached with creditors, with a risk that Dissanayake will compel creditors back to the negotiating table, they wrote. Its pretty crucial that Sri Lanka sticks broadly to the reform part with respect to the IMF program and we expect the new president elect and his party to broadly stay in line with the program, Dilshan Wirasekara, chairman of the Colombo Stock Exchange said in an interview with Bloomberg Television. I dont think we run a risk of cancellation of the program, Wirasekara said adding that only a few parameters of the debt recast deal with IMF could be renegotiated. The country last week reached an agreement in principle with bondholders to restructure about 12.6 billion in debt. Some members of Dissanayakes National Peoples Power coalition had opposed the debt restructuring terms. Stocks have mostly factored in the outcome of the presidential election, said Navin Ratnayake, head of research at Colombo-based John Keells Stock Brokers. Market sentiment will depend on the new governments actions in relation to the economy and debt negotiations, he said. Source: Bloomberg --Agencies",

        "date": "September 24, 2024 07:39 am",
        "content": "(AP)  Israeli strikes Monday on Lebanon killed more than 490 people, including more than 90 women and children, Lebanese authorities said, in the deadliest barrage since the 2006 Israel-Hezbollah war. The Israeli military warned residents in southern and eastern Lebanon to evacuate ahead of its widening air campaign against Hezbollah. Thousands of Lebanese fled the south, and the main highway out of the southern port city of Sidon was jammed with cars heading toward Beirut in the biggest exodus since 2006. Lebanons health ministry said the strikes killed 492 people, including 35 children and 58 women, and wounded 1,645 people  a staggering one-day toll for a country still reeling from a deadly attack on communication devices last week. In a recorded message, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu urged Lebanese civilians to heed Israeli calls to evacuate, saying take this warning seriously. Please get out of harms way now, Netanyahu said. Once our operation is finished, you can come back safely to your homes. Israels military spokesman, Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, said the army will do whatever is necessary to push Hezbollah from Lebanons border with Israel. Hagari claimed Mondays widespread airstrikes had inflicted heavy damage on Hezbollah. But he would not give a timeline for the operation and said Israel was prepared to launch a ground invasion of Lebanon if needed. We are not looking for wars. We are looking to take down the threats, he said. We will do whatever is necessary to do to achieve this mission. Hagari said Hezbollah has launched some 9,000 rockets and drones into Israel since last October, including 250 on Monday alone. The military said Israeli warplanes struck 1,600 Hezbollah targets Monday, destroying cruise missiles, long- and short-range rockets and attack drones. The spokesman said many were hidden in residential areas, showing photos of what he said were weapons concealed in private homes. Hezbollah has turned southern Lebanon into a war zone, he told a news conference. Israel estimates Hezbollah has some 150,000 rockets and missiles, including guided missiles and long-range projectiles capable of striking anywhere in Israel. Earlier Monday evening, the Israeli military said it had carried out a targeted strike in Beirut. It did not give details. Lebanons state-run National News Agency reported three missiles hit southern Beiruts Beir al-Abed neighborhood. Hezbollahs Al-Manar TV said six people were wounded. Lebanese Health Minister Firass Abiad said the earlier strikes hit hospitals, medical centers and ambulances. The government ordered schools and universities to close across most of the country and began preparing shelters for the displaced. Some strikes hit residential areas in the south and the eastern Bekaa Valley. One hit a wooded area as far away as Byblos, more than 80 miles (130 kilometers) from the border north of Beirut. srael said it was expanding the airstrikes to include areas of the valley along Lebanons eastern border with Syria. Hezbollah has long had an established presence in the valley, where the group was founded in 1982 with the help of Irans Revolutionary Guards in the wake of Israels invasion and occupation of Lebanon. Israels military chief, Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi, said Israel was preparing its next phases of operations against Hezbollah, and that its airstrikes were proactive, targeting Hezbollah infrastructure built over the past 20 years. Halevi said the goal was to allow displaced Israelis to return to their homes in northern Israel. Meanwhile, Hezbollah said it fired dozens of rockets toward Israel, including at military bases. It also targeted for a second day the facilities of the Rafael defense firm, headquartered in Haifa. The evacuation warnings were the first of their kind in nearly a year of steadily escalating conflict and came after a particularly heavy exchange of fire Sunday. Hezbollah launched around 150 rockets, missiles and drones into northern Israel in retaliation for strikes that killed a top commander and dozens of fighters. The increasing strikes and counterstrikes have raised fears of all-out war, even as Israel battles Hamas in Gaza and tries to negotiate the release of scores of hostages taken in Hamas Oct. 7 attack. Hezbollah has vowed to continue its strikes in solidarity with Hamas, a fellow Iran-backed militant group. A spokeswoman for President Joe Biden said the administration was concerned about whats happening between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon and insisted that getting a cease-fire deal between Israel and Gaza was key to easing tensions in the region. Its in everyones interest to resolve it quickly and diplomatically, White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters traveling with Biden to New York, where he is to deliver his final address to the U.N. General Assembly on Tuesday. A State Department official, who spoke to reporters on condition of anonymity to discuss the private diplomatic efforts, said the U.S. and numerous other countries were keen to present an off-ramp for both Israel and Hezbollah to reduce tensions and prevent an all-out war. The U.S. has concrete ideas for restoring calm that it will present to allies and partners at this weeks U.N. General Assembly, the official said. He wouldnt detail what the concrete ideas were because he said they had yet to be presented to allies and partners for what he termed a stress test for their likelihood of success. U.N. peacekeepers in southern Lebanon near the Israeli border, meanwhile, have stopped their patrols and are staying in their bases given the volume of exchange of fire, a U.N. spokesman said. Stéphane Dujarric told reporters that U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres was alarmed at the escalating violence and large number of civilian casualties reported in Lebanon. Mondays death toll far surpassed that of Beiruts devastating port explosion in 2020, when hundreds of tons of ammonium nitrate stored in a warehouse detonated, killing at least 218 people and wounding more than 6,000. The Lebanese Health Ministry asked hospitals in southern Lebanon and the eastern Bekaa Valley to postpone non-urgent surgeries to treat people wounded by Israels expanding aggression on Lebanon. On Monday, residents received text messages reading: If you are in a building housing weapons for Hezbollah, move away from the village until further notice, Lebanese media reported. Lebanons information minister, Ziad Makary, said his office in Beirut had received a recorded message telling people to leave the building. This comes in the framework of the psychological war implemented by the enemy, Makary said, and urged people not to give the matter more attention than it deserves. Communities on both sides of the border have largely emptied because of the near-daily exchanges of fire. Israel has accused Hezbollah of transforming entire communities in the south into militant bases, with hidden rocket launchers and other infrastructure. That could lead the Israeli military to wage an especially heavy bombing campaign, even if no ground forces move in. An Israeli airstrike on a Beirut suburb on Friday killed a top Hezbollah military commander and more than a dozen fighters, as well as dozens of civilians, including women and children. Last week, thousands of communications devices, used mainly by Hezbollah members, exploded in different parts of Lebanon, killing 39 people and wounding nearly 3,000, many of them civilians. Lebanon blamed Israel, but Israel did not confirm or deny responsibility. Hezbollah began firing into Israel a day after the Oct. 7 attack in what it said was an attempt to pin down Israeli forces to help Palestinian fighters in Gaza. Israel has retaliated with airstrikes, and the conflict has steadily intensified. Hezbollah has said it will keep up attacks until there is a cease-fire in Gaza, but that appears increasingly elusive as the war nears its anniversary. Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting around 250. Some 100 captives are still held in Gaza, a third of whom are believed to be dead, after most of the rest were released during a weeklong cease-fire in November. Israels offensive has killed over 41,000 Palestinians, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not differentiate between civilians and fighters. It says women and children make up a little over half of those killed. Israel says it has killed over 17,000 militants, without providing evidence. Source: Associated Press ___ --Agencies",

        "title": "California becomes latest US state to restrict student smartphone use at school",
        "date": "September 24, 2024 12:22 pm",
        "content": "School districts in California will have to create rules restricting student smartphone use under a new law Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom signed Monday. The legislation makes California the latest state to try to curb student phone access in an effort to minimize distractions in the classroom and address the mental health impacts of social media on children. Florida, Louisiana, Indiana and several other states have passed laws aimed at restricting student phone use at school. This new law will help students focus on academics, social development, and the world in front of them, not their screens, when theyre in school, Newsom said in a statement. But some critics of phone restriction policies say the burden should not fall on teachers to enforce them. Others worry the rules will make it harder for students to seek help if there is an emergency or argue that decisions on phone bans should be left up to individual districts or schools. We support those districts that have already acted independently to implement restrictions because, after a review of the needs of their stakeholders, they determined that made the most sense for their communities with regards to safety, school culture and academic achievement, said Troy Flint, a spokesperson for the California School Boards Association. We simply oppose the mandate. The law requires districts to pass rules by July 1, 2026, to limit or ban students from using smartphones on campus or while students are under the supervision of school staff. Districts will have to update their policies every five years after that. The move comes after Newsom signed a law in 2019 authorizing school districts to restrict student phone access. In June, he announced plans to take on the issue again after the U.S. surgeon general called on Congress to require warning labels on social media platforms and their effects on young people. The governor then sent letters to districts last month, urging them to limit student device use on campus. That came on a day that the board for the second-largest school district in the country, Los Angeles Unified, voted to ban student phone use during the school day beginning in January. Assemblymember Josh Hoover, a Republican representing Folsom, introduced the bill with a bipartisan group of lawmakers who are also parents. Phones are restricted where Hoovers children ages 15, 12 and 10 attend school. Many of the students dont always like the policy, which is in part a reflection of how addictive phones can be, he said. Anytime youre talking about interrupting that addiction, its certainly going to be hard for students sometimes, Hoover said. But I think overall they understand why its important, why it helps them focus better on their classes and why it actually helps them have better social interaction with their peers face to face when theyre at school. Some parents have raised concerns that school cellphone bans could cut them off from their children if there is an emergency. Those fears were highlighted after a shooting at a Georgia high school left four dead and nine injured this month. The 2019 law authorizing districts to restrict student phone access makes exceptions for emergencies, and the new law doesnt change that. Some proponents of school phone restrictions say its better to have phones off in an active shooter situation, so that they dont ring and reveal a students location. Teachers have reported seeing students more engaged since the Santa Barbara Unified School District began fully implementing a ban on student phone use in class during the 2023-24 school year, Assistant Superintendent ShaKenya Edison said. Nick Melvoin, a Los Angeles Unified board member who introduced the districts resolution, said passing the policies at the district or state level can help prevent students from feeling like theyre missing out on whats going on on social media. Before student cellphone use was banned during the school day at Sutter Middle School in Folsom, students had been seen recording fights, filming TikTok challenges and spending lunchtime looking at online content, Principal Tarik McFall said. The rule has totally changed the culture of the school so that students spend more time talking to one another, he said. To have them put away, to have them power off and that be a practice, it has been a great thing, McFall said. Teachers have become more reliant in recent years on technology as a learning tool for students, particularly since the COVID-19 pandemic, said Mara Harvey, a social studies teacher at Discovery High School in the Natomas Unified School District. The district, which is in Sacramento, provides students in the first through 12th grades with a Chromebook, where they can access online textbooks and Google Classroom, a platform where teachers share class materials. But if a student forgets their Chromebook at home, their smartphone becomes the next viable choice for them to access the curriculum, Harvey said. Source: AP --Agencies",

        "content": "Sean Diddy Combs vast music catalog has seen a jump in streams since his arrest last week and the unsealing of an indictment against him. Under his many musical monikers including Diddy, Puff Daddy and P. Diddy the industry data and analytics company Luminate said the moguls music saw an average 18.3 increase in on-demand streams during the week of his arrest compared to the prior week. George Howard, a distinguished professor of music business management at Berklee College of Music, said hes not surprised by the increase. To him, streaming is akin to a Google search of the artist as a means of satisfying curiosity. Music just becomes another piece of information as people try to comprehend the atrocities, Howard told The Associated Press. Its like, What would someone whose brain works like that, allegedly, what would their music sound like? With Combs several business ventures from Revolt TV to Ciroc vodka, both of which hes no longer affiliated with Howard said many people likely think of Combs as a businessman before they think of him as a musician. The natural curiosity that these types of charges evoke makes sense, Howard said. Its like driving by a car crash. People want to look. An increase in streaming numbers following controversy is not uncommon. After a documentary about R. Kelly accused the RB singer of sexual misconduct involving women and underage girls, his numbers nearly doubled. Howard said the anonymization of streaming is also a factor that could have led to the increases for Combs and Kelly alike. Imagine walking into a record store now like, Yeah, I want to buy this Diddy CD, he said. Combs is charged with federal sex trafficking and racketeering and the indictment, which details allegations dating back to 2008, accuses him of abusing, threatening and coercing women for years to fulfill his sexual desires, protect his reputation, and conceal his conduct. Hes pleaded not guilty to the charges. Source: AP --Agencies",
