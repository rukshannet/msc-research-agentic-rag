        "title": "Sri Lanka debt tumbles as investors see rising political risk  report",
        "date": "September 10, 2024 08:43 am",
        "content": "A selloff in Sri Lanka dollar bonds intensified on Monday (Sep 9) as investors reduced their country exposure over rising political uncertainties before elections later this month. The countrys dollar bonds due in 2030 fell 3 US cents on the dollar to 49.9 US cents, the lowest level since February, extending their decline from their peak this year to about 15 per cent. Notes due in 2027 dropped more than 1 US cent to 49.6 US cents. Market pressure has intensified before elections on September 21 as investors worry that a shakeup in leadership could upset debt talks that have stalled near the finish line. Opposition leaders have said they would look to renegotiate the terms of Sri Lankas programme with the International Monetary Fund. It is looking probable that Sri Lanka will need to further refine the terms of the deal agreed with bondholders and will struggle to do so before the election, said Eng Tat Low, an emerging-market sovereign analyst at Columbia Threadneedle Investment. Whilst I expect volatility to persist, the sharp selloff we have seen over the past few sessions may attract some bargain hunting activities. Anura Kumara Dissanayake, popularly known as AKD, leads the National Peoples Power, a coalition of leftist political parties and groups backed by protesters who ousted the Rajapaksa government in 2022. He is campaigning on a platform of clean governance and eliminating corruption and has vowed to reopen negotiations with the IMF. His party opposes the debt restructuring framework agreed with the multilateral lender. Dissanayake emerged as a key challenger to incumbent President Ranil Wickremesinghe, who remains unpopular for carrying out austerity measures in exchange for an IMF bailout. I think investors are adjusting position ahead of the election, said Eric Fang, fund manager at Eastspring Investments in Singapore. We think any big price correction present an opportunity to buy as the sovereign is on a recovery path and the debt deal presents a fair outcome for both issuer and investors.

        "date": "September 10, 2024 08:48 am",
        "content": "The Public Service Commission (PSC) has announced that if public officials fail to report to work for more than five consecutive days without notice, they must be issued notices of leaving the service within the first five days following their absence. This decision has been made after it was observed that, in some cases, it takes over a year to issue notices of leaving the service when government officials do not report to work without prior notification. The PSC has communicated this directive through a circular to all ministry secretaries and heads of departments. The commission also noted that if a resignation notice is issued to an officer, any excuses or explanations must be submitted in accordance with the provisions of Section 216 of the Public Service Commission Procedural Rules. The relevant circular further states that the decision made by the concerned disciplinary authority regarding an officers resignation, along with any excuses submitted, shall be communicated in writing to the officer. Additionally, the PSC has stipulated that officials who are promoted to the special grade of the Country Wide Services in the future must assume their new positions within 22 working days from the date of receiving their appointment letter. The PSC emphasized that special grade promotions of officers who do not report for duty within a month will be treated as cancelled.",

        "title": "Apple iPhone 16 event shows off AI muscle, new Watches and AirPods",
        "date": "September 10, 2024 10:17 am",
        "content": "Apple on Monday unveiled its long-awaited, artificial intelligence-boosted iPhone 16 and promised improvements in its Siri personal assistant as it rolled out new software, beginning in test mode next month. The next generation of iPhone has been designed for Apple Intelligence from the ground up. It marks the beginning of an exciting new era, Chief Executive Tim Cook said at a product launch. Shares of Apple closed barely changed for the day at 220.91. Apples event came hours before Chinas Huawei launches a tri-fold phone, underscoring the competitive challenge the iPhone maker faces. Apple has yet to announce an AI partner in China to power the 16s. Apple and technology companies around the world are racing to add AI to products, and phones are expected to be among the most important battlegrounds. The Cupertino, California-based company also is betting the AI feature will drive consumers to upgrade amid a slowdown in iPhone sales. Apple Intelligence, the companys AI software, will be used to improve Siri as well as enhancing features such as understanding and identifying objects captured by the phone camera, executives said. A test version of Apple Intelligence will be available in the U.S. version of the English language next month. It will be available for other localized versions of English in December, with versions in languages including Chinese, French, Japanese and Spanish next year. Features including improvements to Siri will be rolled out over time, Apple said. It did not say, however, when it would move beyond test. The iPhone 16 and 16 Plus will cost the same as models they replace and use a new chip and an aluminum case. A customizable button that can control the camera was one of the most touted hardware features in a format that looks similar to previous models. The higher-end 16 Pro and 16 Pro Max are made from titanium and have more AI capability, such as offering suggestions on how to set up a photo shoot more effectively and audio-editing capabilities aimed at professional-level video production. Apples new iPhone chips use the latest version of Arms architecture that includes specific features to speed AI applications. Existing iPhone users who have had their device for 3-4 years will definitely be enticed to upgrade, even if some things are rolling out later, as this will future-proof their device for AI, said International Data Corp analyst Nabila Popal. Still, several analysts described the delays in features as keeping many potential buyers on the sidelines initially. You might see people wait a little bit to see how these things work out, how well they function, and then theyll start to investigate it. But I dont think well see the mad rush that weve seen in years past, said TECHnalysis Research founder Bob ODonnell. By comparison, Huaweis website showed on Monday that it had garnered more than 3 million pre-orders for its Z-shaped tri-fold phone ahead of its official unveiling. This underscores Huaweis ability to navigate U.S. sanctions and solidifies its position against Apple in China, where consumers are hankering for more AI features and are willing to pay for them. Watches and Airpods Apple also unveiled new Watches and AirPods with health-focused capabilities, as well as hardware-design improvements. Apple highlighted the Watchs ability to discover longer-term health conditions such as sleep apnea as well as detecting and responding to emergencies such as a fall. As it updated AirPods, Apple rolled out hearing-aid features that it has submitted for U.S. regulatory review. Apple fans globally have been waiting to see the new phones with AI. IPhones accounted for more than half of Apples 383 billion sales last year. While Android phones may have some of these features, Apple has packaged them well and will be able to market them far more broadly, said D.A. Davidson analyst Gil Luria. China offers particular challenges to Apple. Apple fell out of the list of top five smartphone vendors in China in Q2, said eMarketer senior technology analyst Gadjo Sevilla. It was the first time that Chinas domestic smartphone firms held all five spots. Since Apple Intelligence still needs to be approved by Beijing for a rollout in China, it will likely not initially be a key driver for adoption in the region. In China, Apple aggressively slashed prices earlier this year, prompted by government restrictions and increased domestic competition. The iPhone 16 lineup is the first Apple smartphones designed around these AI features though those are expected also to be available on iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max, the top-end versions of the previous-generation devices. Rivals including Alphabets Google are also showcasing AI features to try to upend Apples dominance in the high-end smartphone market. Google, developer of the Android operating system which competes with Apples iOS, focused its Pixel smartphone rollout event in August on AI features including Gemini Live, which allows users to hold live voice conversations with a digital assistant. Many of the AI features Google announced were also rolled out to the Android-based devices made by manufacturers such as Samsung and Motorola. In June, one week after its developer conference, Apple said it would delay the release of AI-powered features in Europe due to European Union tech rules. Huawei has scheduled an official announcement of its Mate XT Z-fold phone on Tuesday in China. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "title": "Sri Lanka must implement significant security sector reform  UN human rights chief",
        "date": "September 10, 2024 11:00 am",
        "content": "As Sri Lanka approaches presidential and parliamentary elections later this year, the newly elected administration must commit to the concrete transformational changes needed to ensure accountability, justice and reconciliation, says the UN Human Rights chief. The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), Volker Türk, delivered remarks at the Interactive Dialogue on the OHCHR report on Sri Lanka during the UN Human Rights Council session in Geneva on Monday (9), urging Sri Lanka to break from its past and chart a new path forward. Highlighting concerning trends over the past two years, Türk emphasized the need for the continued attention and support of the international community. Two years have passed since mass protests demanded democratic reforms and an end to corruption and the abuse of power. Today, despite promises of a new beginning, those demands remain largely unfulfilled. And while 15 years have passed since the end of the devastating civil war, victims and their families are still waiting for truth, for justice, and for reparation, he said. Further, he warned that the persistent sense of impunity hampers progress and perpetuates violations and corruption. The economic situation in Sri Lanka remains dire, with the poverty rate doubling between 2021 and 2023, forcing many households to make difficult choices between basic needs like food, healthcare, education, and energy, he said. As Sri Lanka approaches presidential and parliamentary elections later this year, Türk called on the new administration to commit to transformative changes that ensure accountability, justice, and reconciliation. Those in power must protect fully the rights to freedom of expression, association, and peaceful assembly prior to, during, and after the upcoming elections. And the international community must support this transformation. It is important for Sri Lankas creditors to provide the Government with the fiscal space necessary to realize all human rights, including economic, social, and cultural rights, he said. The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights expressed particular concern over new and proposed laws that grant broad powers to security forces and restrict civil liberties. One such example, the draft NGOs Registration and Supervision Bill, has a range of problematic provisions  including broad discretion given to authorities to deny registration of civil society organisations  which carry major risks threatening civic space. He further said that reports of persistent harassment, surveillance, and intimidation of journalists, civil society actors, victims and human rights defenders are unacceptable. Türk highlighted the absence of accountability for both past and present violations, noting a lack of progress in emblematic cases such as the 2006 massacres of humanitarian workers in Muttur, the killing of five Tamil students in Trincomalee, and the murder of journalist Lasantha Wickrematunge in 2009. Additionally, the criminal investigation into the 2019 Easter Sunday bombings has seen limited advancement. Türk pointed out that individuals allegedly responsible for gross violations continue to be appointed to senior positions, further entrenching impunity. Addressing enforced disappearances, the High Commissioner lamented that the fate and whereabouts of tens of thousands of people remain unknown, leaving their families in anguish. He stressed that acknowledging past violations, the states responsibility, and the legacy of these atrocities is crucial for rebuilding trust and addressing polarization in Sri Lanka. This must change, and that would start with a formal acknowledgement of the serious violations that occurred during the war, of the responsibility of the State and security forces for the conduct of their own personnel, and of the legacy of those atrocities for victims and communities. A clear, public change of narrative along these lines would help to re-establish trust in the authorities and begin to address the deep polarization in the country, he said. A public change in narrative would support processes of truth, reconciliation, and healing, ultimately helping to rebuild the social contract. Further, Türk underscored the broader implications of failing to address past violations, noting that the lack of accountability for international crimes can renew old conflicts and sow seeds for future unrest. He stated that without accountability, the cycle of violence will continue. However, he offered hope, suggesting that a path paved with justice and accountability could lead to healing, reconciliation, and peace. He urged Sri Lanka to pursue an inclusive national vision that addresses the root causes of conflict and undertakes fundamental reforms to strengthen democracy and advance accountability and reconciliation. Türk called on the Sri Lankan government to implement significant security sector reforms and hold accountable those implicated in serious violations. He also urged the government to take immediate steps to prevent future human rights violations. The Government must implement significant security sector reform  including holding to account those individuals implicated in serious violations. And it must take immediate steps to prevent human rights violations. He assured that the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights stands ready to support Sri Lanka on its journey toward change, reflecting the voices of Sri Lankans from all communities who desire progress. My Office is not here to point the finger, but to lend a hand. We are reflecting what Sri Lankans from all communities are telling us. They want change, and my Office is ready to support Sri Lanka on that journey. In the meantime, it is important for this Council and UN Member States to continue to address the accountability gap in Sri Lanka  including by supporting the work of my Office. Türk emphasized the role of the Human Rights Council and UN Member States in closing the accountability gap in Sri Lanka. He encouraged States to take action through their domestic systems and international forums to support meaningful accountability and reconciliation in Sri Lanka. The High Commissioner concluded by acknowledging the prolonged distress experienced by Sri Lankan communities and stressed that it is time to bring closure to the past, break the destructive cycle of violence, and begin an inclusive journey toward a just and sustainable future for all Sri Lankans.",

        "date": "September 10, 2024 12:01 pm",
        "content": "James Earl Jones, who overcame racial prejudice and a severe stutter to become a celebrated icon of stage and screen eventually lending his deep, commanding voice to CNN, The Lion King and Darth Vader has died. He was 93. His agent, Barry McPherson, confirmed Jones died Monday morning at home in New Yorks Hudson Valley region. The cause was not immediately clear. The pioneering Jones, who in 1965 became one of the first African American actors in a continuing role on a daytime drama (As the World Turns) and worked deep into his 80s, won two Emmys, a Golden Globe, two Tony Awards, a Grammy, the National Medal of Arts and the Kennedy Center Honors. He was also given an honorary Oscar and a special Tony for lifetime achievement. In 2022, a Broadway theater was renamed in his honor. He cut an elegant figure late in life, with a wry sense of humor and a ferocious work habit. In 2015, he arrived at rehearsals for a Broadway run of The Gin Game having already memorized the play and with notebooks filled with comments from the creative team. He said he was always in service of the work. The need to storytell has always been with us, he told The Associated Press then. I think it first happened around campfires when the man came home and told his family he got the bear, the bear didnt get him. Jones created such memorable film roles as the reclusive writer coaxed back into the spotlight in Field of Dreams, the boxer Jack Johnson in the stage and screen hit The Great White Hope, the writer Alex Haley in Roots: The Next Generation and a South African minister in Cry, the Beloved Country. He was also a sought-after voice actor, expressing the villainy of Darth Vader (No, I am your father, commonly misremembered as Luke, I am your father), as well as the benign dignity of King Mufasa in both the 1994 and 2019 versions of Disneys The Lion King and announcing This is CNN during station breaks. He won a 1977 Grammy for his performance on the Great American Documents audiobook. If you were an actor or aspired to be an actor, if you pounded the pavement in these streets looking for jobs, one of the standards we always had was to be a James Earl Jones, Samuel L. Jackson once said. Some of his other films include Dr. Strangelove, The Greatest (with Muhammad Ali), Conan the Barbarian, Three Fugitives and playing an admiral in three blockbuster Tom Clancy adaptations The Hunt for Red October, Patriot Games and Clear and Present Danger. In a rare romantic comedy, Claudine, Jones had an onscreen love affair with Diahann Carroll. LeVar Burton, who starred alongside Jones in the TV movie Guyana Tragedy: The Story of Jim Jones, paid tribute on X, writing, There will never be another of his particular combination of graces. Jones made his Broadway debut in 1958s Sunrise At Campobello and would win his two Tony Awards for The Great White Hope (1969) and Fences (1987). He also was nominated for On Golden Pond (2005) and Gore Vidals The Best Man (2012). He was celebrated for his command of Shakespeare and Athol Fugard alike. More recent Broadway appearances include Cat on a Hot Tin Roof, Driving Miss Daisy, The Iceman Cometh, and You Cant Take It With You. As a rising stage and television actor, he performed with the New York Shakespeare Festival Theater in Othello, Macbeth and King Lear and in off-Broadway plays. Jones was born by the light of an oil lamp in a shack in Arkabutla, Mississippi, on Jan. 17, 1931. His father, Robert Earl Jones, had deserted his wife before the babys arrival to pursue life as a boxer and, later, an actor. When Jones was 6, his mother took him to her parents farm near Manistee, Michigan. His grandparents adopted the boy and raised him. A world ended for me, the safe world of childhood, Jones wrote in his autobiography, Voices and Silences. The move from Mississippi to Michigan was supposed to be a glorious event. For me it was a heartbreak, and not long after, I began to stutter. Too embarrassed to speak, he remained virtually mute for years, communicating with teachers and fellow students with handwritten notes. A sympathetic high school teacher, Donald Crouch, learned that the boy wrote poetry, and demanded that Jones read one of his poems aloud in class. He did so faultlessly. Teacher and student worked together to restore the boys normal speech. I could not get enough of speaking, debating, orating  acting, he recalled in his book. At the University of Michigan, he failed a pre-med exam and switched to drama, also playing four seasons of basketball. He served in the Army from 1953 to 1955. In New York, he moved in with his father and enrolled with the American Theater Wing program for young actors. Father and son waxed floors to support themselves while looking for acting jobs. True stardom came suddenly in 1970 with The Great White Hope. Howard Sacklers Pulitzer Prize-winning Broadway play depicted the struggles of Jack Johnson, the first Black heavyweight boxing champion, amid the racism of early 20th-century America. In 1972, Jones repeated his role in the movie version and was nominated for an Academy Award as best actor. Jones two wives were also actors. He married Julienne Marie Hendricks in 1967. After their divorce, he married Cecilia Hart, best known for her role as Stacey Erickson in the CBS police drama Paris, in 1982. (She died in 2016.) They had a son, Flynn Earl, born in 1983. In 2022, the Cort Theatre on Broadway was renamed after Jones, with a ceremony that included Norm Lewis singing Go the Distance, Brian Stokes Mitchell singing Make Them Hear You and words from Mayor Eric Adams, Samuel L. Jackson and LaTanya Richardson Jackson. You cant think of an artist that has served America more, director Kenny Leon told the AP. Its like it seems like a small act, but its a huge action. Its something we can look up and see thats tangible. Citing his stutter as one of the reasons he wasnt a political activist, Jones nonetheless hoped his art could change minds. I realized early on, from people like Athol Fugard, that you cannot change anybodys mind, no matter what you do, he told the AP. As a preacher, as a scholar, you cannot change their mind. But you can change the way they feel. Source: AP --Agencies",

        "content": "The Presidential Candidate of the National Peoples Power (NPP), Anura Kumara Dissanayake says that the NPP would establish a government that truly supports the people of Sri Lanka. He expressed this while speaking at a public rally in Thambuttegama on Monday (09). We are not coming to take what you have. We are coming to increase what you have. If you have one cow, we will help you to make a herd. If you are cultivating an acre, we will assist you in expanding it to two or three acres. If you own only one shop, we will help you to open shops in several cities. If you are only doing business in Sri Lanka, well help you expand overseas. Thats why we are coming, said the NPPs presidential candidate. He also criticized the current administration and former rulers of the country for enriching themselves while putting the country in poverty. They came to make the country poor and make themselves rich. They dont want to produce but to import. The more they import, the better the commission. When importing eggs from India, the commission is Rs. 80 million. When 10 million eggs are imported, the commission is Rs. 80 million, he claimed. According to Dissanayake, officials are more interested in profiting from imports rather than developing domestic industries. The minister does not care if the poultry industry is developed. It will be good for the minister if eggs are imported. Kantale and Higurana (sugar factories) were closed and sugar was imported. The tax was adjusted for Rs. 15 billion. The more things are imported, the more profitable it is to them, said the NPP presidential candidate. He further alleged that the tax fraud through the imported coconut oil is Rs. 3.5 billion. They never thought to build, but to bring. But we are ready to build everything that can be built in the country. Work collaboratively. We are not coming to put petrol sheds, bars and engage in sand mining. We come to do business. You start producing and doing business. We will support them all.",

        "date": "September 10, 2024 03:56 pm",
        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe has expressed his commitment to integrating Generation Z into society and empowering them to take responsibility for the countrys development. He said he believes this will enable Sri Lankas youth to shape the society they envision for themselves. The President emphasized that, like in other countries, Sri Lankan youth should be given the opportunity to influence the nations future. He acknowledged that Sri Lanka had once been ahead of many developed nations but has since fallen behind due to traditional politics and misleading slogans. President Wickremesinghe addressed these points during the AskRanil youth meeting held yesterday (09) at the Galle Face Hotel in Colombo. President Wickremesinghe also highlighted the importance of maintaining the economic stability achieved over the past two years, warning that without continued efforts, the economy could collapse again. To secure the future of the country and its youth, he stated that he needs the next five years to make crucial decisions. In response to a question, the President clarified that reports suggesting the Cabinet had not approved the planned salary increase for 2025 were incorrect, confirming that approval had already been granted. When asked about his plan for young people as the economy grows, he said, My plan is to empower the Gen Z generation to take responsibility for building the future they want by integrating them into society. They must determine the future they desire. Wickramasinghe stated that when he was around 20, they faced issues under the leadership of Mrs. Sirimavo Bandaranaike and that they worked with President J.R. Jayewardene, who told them to shape society the way they wanted after he became president. He opened up the economy and initiated the Mahaweli project. He stressed the importance of building a peaceful society that can overcome the crises of the past two years while also improving the countrys economy. Wickremesinghe argued that Sri Lanka cannot afford to remain a poor country indefinitely, drawing a comparison to his younger days when Japan lagged behind Sri Lanka, whereas now, countries like Myanmar, Afghanistan, and Laos are trailing Sri Lanka. He warned that without swift action, these countries could overtake Sri Lanka and futility of making empty political promises and emphasized the need for making decisions about the future, as other nations that have rebuilt themselves have done. He attributed the current situation to past deceptions, unsustainable giveaways, and excessive borrowing, suggesting that more honest and responsible approaches could have prevented the countrys current predicament. He continued, Now, this generation has been burdened with repaying debts they didnt incur. Therefore, we must set the path to build a better society, one that avoids such crises in the future. It is your responsibility to carry this forward. When asked why Gen Z should choose him as the next President, Ranil Wickremesinghe highlighted his efforts to stabilize the countrys daily life despite challenges like rising prices. He emphasized that ensuring economic stability is crucial to avoid a repeat of past crises, making the next five years vital for securing the countrys future. But stability alone is not enough how will we generate the foreign exchange we need? Our income is insufficient to cover our imports, and export revenue is inadequate. Only by expanding our export economy can we build a resilient financial system. Otherwise, in 15 years, we could face a collapse even more severe than Argentinas, he said. Further highlighting his economic goals, he noted that Sri Lankas GDP was USD 89 billion in 2019, and his aim is to increase it to between USD 350 and USD 400 billion by 2025. He assured that, even if we are no longer here, we are committed to laying the foundation for you to build a prosperous and resilient state.",

Rajapaksa also outlined his aim to transform Trincomalee into a major hub for cruise ship tourism. We had a plan.

        "date": "September 10, 2024 10:14 pm",
        "content": "The Government of Sri Lanka has rejected the latest report on the island nation by the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, accusing it of exceeding the OHCHRs mandated sphere of human rights to comment on macroeconomics as well as financial and budgetary issues under sovereign parliamentary purview. Speaking as the country concerned following the presentation of the report of the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), Sri Lankas Permanent Representative Ambassador Himalee Arunatilaka elaborated that Sri Lanka has succeeded in stabilizing its economy through a combination of prudent economic decision-making and financial oversight and governance as acknowledged widely. Sri Lanka also reiterated its long-standing commitment to engaging with the UN, the Universal Declaration on Human Rights and the related Treaties. The Permanent Representative further stated that while strengthening the economy for the prosperity of all Sri Lankans is a priority for the Government, Sri Lanka continues to make progress on national unity and reconciliation. Continued efforts through domestic processes, including the Office on Missing Persons (OMP), Office for Reparations (OR), Office for National Unity and Reconciliation (ONUR), the Office for Overseas Sri Lankans and the Interim Secretariat for the Truth and Reconciliation Mechanism (ISTRM) were highlighted, while details were provided in the Governments written response to the OHCHR Report. Ambassador Arunatilaka highlighted that social protection measures such as the Aswesuma programme have been put in place to support vulnerable groups. It was underlined that the Report exceeded OHCHRs mandate by commenting on macroeconomics as well as financial and budgetary issues under sovereign Parliamentary purview. The Permanent Representative expressed Sri Lankas disassociation from the report of the OHCHR which lacked balance and failed to acknowledge the atrocities committed by the LTTE during decades of a brutal terrorist conflict. Sri Lanka reiterated its strong rejection of Resolution 511 and the external mechanism established within the OHCHR which is unwarranted and counter-productive. The Ambassador further said: Let me restate at the outset, Sri Lankas opposition to Human Rights Council Resolution 511 which mandated the report under consideration and the establishment of the external evidence-gathering mechanism. This resolution was adopted without Sri Lankas consent by a divided vote within this Council. We disassociate with the report for the reasons stated in our detailed response, available on the OHCHR website. It is most surprising that the report steps far out of its mandated sphere of human rights to comment on macro economics as well as financial and budgetary issues under sovereign parliamentary purview. Contrary to the reaction of the rest of our international partners, it projects a negative overview for Sri Lankas future, fails to recognize social stabilization and the preservation of parliamentary democracy overcoming recent severe challenges, the return to normalcy with the restoration of food, energy and public services and stability arising from significantly improved outlook. Furthermore, it makes no mention of the brutal acts of terrorism and human rights violations committed by the LTTE, including child recruitment, suicide bombings, assassination of democratically elected MPs and leaders in SL and abroad, and the disruption of democratic rights and freedoms of the people, especially in the North and the East. I wish to once again emphasize Sri Lankas strong rejection of Resolution 511 and the external evidence-gathering mechanism established within OHCHR. This unproductive and unwarranted mechanism exceeds the Councils mandate, contradicts its founding principles, and polarizes the Council, undermining the progress we have made domestically. The selective and disproportionate focus on handpicked developing countries while ignoring critical situations elsewhere is unacceptable. We urge the Council to avoid politicization and double standards, and to focus on dire humanitarian situations that require urgent action to maintain its credibility.",

        "date": "September 11, 2024 07:52 am",
        "content": "(AP)  Hundreds of protesters broke into Mexicos Senate on Tuesday as lawmakers weighed a contentious plan to overhaul the countrys judiciary, forcing the body to take a temporary recess for the safety of the senators. The shut down came just hours after Mexicos ruling party, Morena, appeared to have wrangled the votes it needed to jam through the proposal after at least one member of an opposition party was accused of flipping to support it. That move and other political maneuvering ahead of a vote on the plan championed by outgoing President Andrés Manuel López Obrador fueled even more outrage after weeks of protests by judicial employees and law students. Critics and observers say the plan, which would have all judges elected, could threaten judicial independence and deal a severe blow to the system of checks and balances. Some protesters entered the Senate chambers in an effort to block the vote after they said lawmakers were not listening to their demands. Protesters broke through the door of the Senate chamber pushing aggressively, using pipes and chains. At least one person fainted after protesters broke in. The judiciary isnt going to fall, yelled the protesters, waving Mexican flags and signs against the overhaul. They were joined by a number of opposition senators as they chanted in the chamber. Others outside the court roared when newscasters announced the Senate was taking a recess. Among them was Alejandro Navarrete, a 30-year-old judicial worker, who said that people like him working in the courts knowing the danger the reform represents came to call on the Senate to strike down the proposal. They have decided to sell out the nation, and sell out for political capital they were offered, we felt obligated to enter the Senate, he said, carrying a Mexican flag. Our intention is not violent, we didnt intend to hurt them, but we intend to make it clear that the Mexican people wont allow them to lead us into a dictatorship. Despite unrest in recent weeks, the plan sailed through the lower chamber of Congress last week, and was passed onto the Senate, where López Obradors Morena party lacked the necessary supermajority to approve it. In recent weeks, it was able to peel off two senators from an opposition party, but came into this week still missing one more. It was unclear where that vote would come from because the countrys opposition vehemently opposes the plan. But over the weekend, observers began to speculate that a senator from the conservative National Action Party (PAN), Miguel Ángel Yunes Márquez, would support Morena as he refused to answer calls from his party leadership. On Tuesday, Yunes Márquez announced he would take leave due to health issues and be replaced by his father, Miguel Ángel Yunes Linares, a former governor of Veracruz. While the father and son did not immediately confirm that they were switching to support the overhaul, Yunes Linares strolled into the Senate chambers and was met with applause and chants of hero! by Morena senators and screams of traitor! from his own party. One PAN senator, Lilly Téllez, even threw dozens of coins at Yunes Linares, calling him a traitor who sold out his country for his own benefit. A Senate vote was expected Wednesday. The national head of PAN, Marko Cortés, claimed that it is evident that there was an impunity pact between the Yuneses and the government so he would vote in favor of the overhaul. Cortés was referring to a July arrest order for Sen. Yunes Márquez, for alleged falsification of documents and fraud related to his candidacy. Yunes had challenged it and got a temporary suspension, calling it a political persecution by the governing Morena party, the same party his father now appears ready to support. His father, Yunes Linares, dodged questions from the press about how he would vote on Tuesday, but accused Cortés of lynching him and claimed it was absolutely false that he has been coerced to vote for the overhaul. He was flanked by two Morena senators as he spoke. Im not a traitor, Ive never betrayed anyone, he said. The accusations arent democracy. I am coming here to act completely freely. A Yunes vote in favor would allow the ruling party to clear the biggest hurdle in making the proposal law. If it passes the Senate, it will have to be ratified by the legislatures of 17 of Mexicos 32 states, but the governing party is believed to have the necessary support. The plan has received fierce criticism from within and outside the country. López Obrador  a populist long averse to independent regulatory bodies, who has long ignored courts and attacked judges  claims his plan would crack down on corruption by making it easier to punish judges. Critics say it would handicap the judiciary, stack courts with judges favoring the presidents party, allow anyone with a law degree to become a judge and even make it easier for politicians and criminals to influence courts. It has spooked investors and prompted the U.S. Ambassador Ken Salazar to call it a risk to democracy and an economic threat. The Tuesday break in by protesters was met by sharp criticism by some like Morena senator Andrea Chávez, who wrote in a post on X: Violently breaking into the plenary session where we, the representatives of the people, deliberate is not a way to resolve differences. Others like Mayuli Martínez Simón, a PAN senator, cast the blame on the ruling party as they stood on the Senate floor among throngs of protesters. As she did, protesters trickled out, headed to another building where senators planned to restart their debate at 7 pm. With absence of dialogue from Morena, today this is what were seeing. The citizens, Mexicans, took over the Senate, entering with force. Its not the best, but we didnt have any other option, she told the Associated Press in an interview.

        "title": "Harris rattles Trump in combative debate",
        "date": "September 11, 2024 11:42 am",
        "content": "Democratic candidate Kamala Harris put her Republican rival Donald Trump on the defensive in a combative presidential debate on Tuesday with a stream of attacks on his fitness for office, his support of abortion restrictions and his myriad legal woes. A former prosecutor, Harris, 59, controlled the debate from the start, getting under her rivals skin repeatedly and prompting a visibly angry Trump, 78, to deliver a series of falsehood-filled retorts. At one point, she goaded the former president by saying that people often leave his campaign rallies early out of exhaustion and boredom. Trump, who has been frustrated by the size of Harris own crowds, said, My rallies, we have the biggest rallies, the most incredible rallies in the history of politics. He then pivoted to a false claim about immigrants eating pets in Springfield, Ohio, that has circulated on social media and was amplified by Trumps vice presidential candidate, Senator JD Vance. Theyre eating the dogs! he said, as Harris laughed in disbelief. The people that came in, theyre eating the cats! Theyre eating the pets of the people that live there. Talk about extreme, Harris replied. With eight weeks to go before the election, and days until early voting starts in some states, the debate - the only one scheduled - offered a rare opportunity for both candidates to make their case for a television audience of tens of millions of voters. The candidates clashed over immigration, foreign policy and healthcare, but the debate was light on specific policy details. Instead, Harris forceful approach succeeded in putting the focus on Trump, leaving her allies jubilant and some Republicans acknowledging Trumps struggles. Trump repeated his false claim that his 2020 election defeat was due to fraud, called Harris a Marxist and asserted falsely that migrants have caused a violent crime spree. Trump missed an opportunity to stay focused prosecuting the case against Biden-Harris on the economy and border, and instead took her bait and chased down rabbit holes on election denialism and immigrants eating our pets, said Marc Short, who served as chief of staff for Trumps former Vice President Mike Pence. In a boost to the Harris campaign, pop megastar Taylor Swift told her 283 million followers on Instagram immediately following the debate that she would back Vice President Harris and her running mate Tim Walz in the Nov. 5 election. She signed it childless cat lady, a reference to controversial remarks made by Vance. Online prediction market PredictIts 2024 presidential general election market showed Trumps likelihood of victory declining during the debate, to 47 from 52. Harris odds improved to 55 from 53. In a sign of confidence in the debates outcome, Harris campaign challenged Trump to a second round in October. Trump afterwards took the rare step of going into the nearby spin room, a job usually left to supporters, where he told reporters, This was my best debate. Asked about the Harris campaign seeking a second debate, Trump told Fox News: She wants it because she lost. I have to think about it, but if you won the debate, I sort of think maybe I shouldnt do it. Why should I do another debate? he said. Trump, who has spent weeks launching personal attacks on Harris including racist and sexist insults, largely avoided that pattern during the debates early moments but quickly became agitated under Harris offensive. Trump was asked by the moderators about one of those attacks, when he told an event with Black journalists in July that Harris had recently become a Black person. I couldnt care less, he said. Whatever she wants to be is OK with me. Harris, who has both Black and South Asian heritage, responded, I think its a tragedy that we have someone who wants to be president who has consistently over the course of his career attempted to use race to divide the American people. She criticized Trump over his criminal conviction for covering up hush money payments to a porn star as well as his other indictments and a civil judgment finding him liable for sexual assault. Trump has denied wrongdoing and again accused Harris and the Democrats of orchestrating all of the cases without evidence. The debate got under way at 9 p.m. ET (0100 GMT on Wednesday) with a surprise handshake between the two opponents, who had never met before. Harris approached Trump at his lectern, introducing herself by name, in what was the first handshake at a presidential debate since 2016. The encounter was particularly important for Harris, with opinion polls showing that more than a quarter of likely voters feel they do not know enough about her. Harris entered the race only seven weeks ago after President Joe Bidens exit. Harris delivered a lengthy attack on abortion limits, speaking passionately about women denied emergency care and victims of incest unable to terminate their pregnancies due to statewide bans that have proliferated since the U.S. Supreme Court eliminated a nationwide right in 2022. Three Trump appointees were in the majority of that ruling. She also claimed Trump would support a national ban. Trump called that assertion untrue but declined to say explicitly that he would veto such a law. Trump, who has sometimes struggled with messaging on abortion, said falsely that Harris and Democrats support infanticide, which - as ABC News moderator Linsey Davis noted - is illegal in every state. Harris also sought to tie Trump to Project 2025, a conservative policy blueprint that proposes expanding executive power, eliminating environmental regulations and making it illegal to ship abortion pills across state lines, among other right-wing goals. Trump retorted that he has nothing to do with Project 2025, though some of his advisers were involved in its creation. Ron Bonjean, a Republican strategist, said Trump didnt do himself any favors but added that it remains unclear whether Harris performance will change the races dynamics. Polls show a vast majority of Americans have made up their minds, leaving a small sliver of undecided voters up for grabs. Clashes on economy, foreign policy The candidates opened the debate by focusing on the economy, an issue that opinion polls show favors Trump. Harris attacked Trumps intention to impose high tariffs on foreign goods - a proposal she has likened to a sales tax on the middle class - while touting her plan to offer tax benefits to families and small businesses. Trump criticized Harris for the persistent inflation during the Biden administrations term, though he overstated the level of price increases. Inflation, he said, has been a disaster for people, for the middle class, for every class. The candidates also exchanged barbs over the Israel-Gaza war and the Russian invasion of Ukraine, though neither offered specifics on how they would seek to end each conflict. Harris accused Trump of being willing to abandon U.S. support for Ukraine to curry favor with Russian President Vladimir Putin, calling Trump a disgrace, while Trump claimed Harris hates Israel - an assertion she rejected. Presidential debates do not necessarily change voters minds, but they can be deeply consequential. Bidens poor performance against Trump in June led him to abandon his campaign on July 21. In a contest that could again come down to tens of thousands of votes in a handful of states, even a small shift in public opinion could alter the outcome. The two candidates are effectively tied in the seven battleground states likely to decide the election, according to polling averages compiled by the New York Times. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "title": "President Ranil responds to Anura Kumaras challenge to a debate",
        "date": "September 11, 2024 12:44 pm",
        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe has emphasized that Anura Kumara Dissanayake, who had avoided answering his question about whether the NPPs economic policy is export- or import-oriented, was now inviting him to a debate. The President further suggested that Anura, Sunil Handunnetti, and Harshana Suriyapperuma first hold a separate debate to clarify the NPPs proper economic policy to the nation before debating with him. The President also mentioned that, as previously discussed, a time could be set for a video discussion with Anura, himself, and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) Managing Director. He joked that even though Sajith does not allow others to speak, he too could be invited to the discussion. President Wickremesinghe made these remarks during a meeting held yesterday (10) with intellectuals and business leaders from the Kurunegala District at the Asliya Golden Cassandra Hotel in Kurunegala. Additionally, the President questioned why Anura Kumara Dissanayake, in his policy statement, presented a budget with an expenditure of Rs. 8,900 billion and an income of Rs. 4,900 billion, creating a deficit of Rs. 4,000 billion, which would devastate the countrys economy. The President emphasized that instead of making empty speeches and promises on stage, Anura should present a clear and proper economic policy to the country. He stated that the governments budget outlines future expenditures at Rs.6, 800 billion, with projected income at Rs.5, 100 billion, resulting in a budget deficit of Rs.1, 700 billion, or 5.2 of GDP. We are confident in our capacity to manage this deficit effectively. He alleged that if the NPP delivers on its promises, the cost will be Rs.8, 900 billion and that they also propose tax concessions, which would reduce income to Rs.4, 900 billion. This would create a deficit of Rs.4, 000 billion, or 11.9 of GDP. Given these figures, its unclear how they plan to advance the economy, the President said. Furthermore, he warned that if Sri Lanka breaches its agreements with the IMF and seek funds from the market, the interest rate could soar to 25. This could result in the value of the dollar rising to Rs.500, and wed lose IMF support due to the violation of our agreements, potentially leading to an economic collapse. He emphasized that in order to strengthen the countrys economy, Sri Lanka needs to focus on developing an export driven economy and that this is their stance. Recently, Anura Kumara Dissanayake also mentioned in Kelaniya that his approach includes an export-oriented strategy, the President said. However, his policy statement proposes abolishing free trade agreements. It is challenging to advance an export economy without these agreements, as they facilitate the export of goods, he cautioned. Wickremesinghe charged that when his government introduced the Economic Transformation Act, the NPPs Sunil Sunil Handunnetti and Harshana Suriyapperuma filed a lawsuit claiming that the export economy was unconstitutional. I saw, Anura has invited me to a debate in Anamaduwa, but how can I participate without knowing whether their economic strategy focuses on export or import? Therefore, the President proposed a debate among Anura Dissanayake, Sunil Handunnetti, and Harshana Suriyapperuma to clarify whether their economic policy is geared towards an export economy or an import economy. Once this is clarified, the President said he is willing to arrange a video discussion with Anura Kumara Dissanayake and the Managing Director of the IMF with myself, as he had mentioned earlier. I am prepared to make this happen. If needed, we should also invite Sajith Premadasa. However, its worth noting that when Sajith speaks, the Managing Director of the IMF often doesnt get a chance to address the audience. Nevertheless, lets extend the invitation to Sajith, he jested. Wickremesinghe reiterated that Anura Kumara should clarify whether his economic policy favours an export-oriented economy or an import-driven one. I am questioning Anura Dissanayake on why those who have contributed to economic mismanagement and national bankruptcy are being given financial support. Therefore, he urged Anura Kumara Dissanayake to present a clear and viable economic policy, rather than just making speeches from the platform.",

We want to stop this ugly political gambling. What has happened in the politics of Sri Lanka so far? When an election comes, they jump here and there. They take from here and there. What kind of cheap politics exists in Sri Lanka? Nowhere else in the world is there such extremely ugly and shameful politics. Now look at what is happening on Sajiths stage and Ranils stage. Thats why even during the election period, only the National Peoples Power (NPP) has principled politics, he added. He further emphasized that, unlike other political parties, the NPP is the only party that has avoided accepting any parliamentarians responsible for criminal activities, corruption, espousing racism or representing extremist camps. Dissanayake urges people to consider these facts when choosing who to vote for. He promised that a victory on September 21 would lead to significant amendments to the constitution and he further assured that if someone switched political parties, they would lose their MP position.",

        "title": "Google and Apple lose their court fights against EU and owe billions in fines and taxes",
        "date": "September 11, 2024 04:14 pm",
        "content": "Google lost its last bid to overturn a European Union antitrust penalty, after the blocs top court ruled against it Tuesday in a case that came with a whopping fine and helped jumpstart an era of intensifying scrutiny for Big Tech companies. The European Unions top court rejected Googles appeal against the 2.4 billion euro (2.7 billion) penalty from the European Commission, the 27-nation blocs top antitrust enforcer, for violating antitrust rules with its comparison shopping service. Also Tuesday, Apple lost its challenge against an order to repay 13 billion euros (14.34 billion) in back taxes to Ireland, after the European Court of Justice issued a separate decision siding with the commission in a case targeting unlawful state aid for global corporations. Both companies have now exhausted their appeals in the cases that date to the previous decade. Together, the court decisions are a victory for European Commissioner Margrethe Vestager, whos expected to step down next month after 10 years as the commissions top official overseeing competition. One of the takeaways from the Apple decision is the sense that, again, the EU authorities and courts are prepared to flex their (collective) muscles to bring Big Tech to heel where necessary, Alex Haffner, a competition partner at law firm Fladgate, said by email. The Google ruling reflects the growing confidence with which competition regulators worldwide are tackling the perceived excesses of the Big Tech companies, said Gareth Mills, partner at law firm Charles Russell Speechlys. The courts willingness to back the legal rationale and the level of fine will undoubtedly embolden the competition regulators further. The shopping fine was one of three huge antitrust penalties for Google from the commission, which punished the Silicon Valley giant in 2017 for unfairly directing visitors to its own Google Shopping service over competitors. We are disappointed with the decision of the Court, which relates to a very specific set of facts, Google said in a brief statement. The company said it made changes to comply with the commissions decision requiring it to treat competitors equally. It started holding auctions for shopping search listings that it would bid for alongside other comparison shopping services. Our approach has worked successfully for more than seven years, generating billions of clicks for more than 800 comparison shopping services, Google said. European consumer group BEUC hailed the courts decision, saying it shows how the blocs competition law remains highly relevant in digital markets. It is a good outcome for all European consumers at the end of the day, Director General Agustín Reyna said in an interview. It means that many smaller companies or rivals will be able to go to different comparison shopping sites. They dont need to depend on Google to reach out to customers. Google is still appealing its two other EU antitrust cases: a 2018 fine of 4.125 billion euros (4.55 billion) involving its Android operating system and a 2019 penalty of 1.49 billion euros (1.64 billion) over its AdSense advertising platform. Despite the amounts of money involved, the adverse rulings will leave a small financial dent in tow of the worlds richest and most profitable companies. The combined bill of 15.4 billion euro (17 billion) facing Apple and Alphabet, Googles parent company, represents 0.3 of their combined market value of 4.73 trillion euro (5.2 trillion). Apples stock price dipped slightly in Tuesdays late afternoon trading while Alphabet shares rose 1, signaling investors were unfazed by the developments in Europe. Those three cases foreshadowed expanded efforts by regulators worldwide to crack down on the tech industry. The EU has since opened more investigations into Big Tech companies and drew up a new law to prevent them from cornering online markets, known as the Digital Markets Act. European Commissioner and Executive Vice President Margrethe Vestager said that the shopping case was one of the first attempts to regulate a digital company and inspired similar efforts worldwide. The case was symbolic because it demonstrated even the most powerful tech companies could be held accountable. No one is above the law, Vestager told a press briefing in Brussels. Vestager said the commission will continue to open competition cases even as it enforces the Digital Markets Act. The DMA is a sweeping rulebook that forces Google and other tech giants to give consumers more choice by following a set of dos and donts. Google is also now facing pressure over its lucrative digital advertising business from the EU and Britain, which are carrying out separate investigations, and the United States, where the Department of Justice is taking the company to federal court over its alleged dominance in ad tech. Apple failed in its last bid to avoid repaying its Irish taxes Tuesday after the Court of Justice upheld a lower court ruling against the company, in the dispute that dates back to 2016. Vestager, who said she had been braced for defeat, hailed it as a landmark victory for tax justice. It was a surprise win for the commission, which has previously targeted Amazon, Starbucks and Fiat with tax rulings that were later overturned on appeal. They were part of the EUs efforts to stamp out sweetheart deals that let companies pay little to no taxes in a fight that highlighted the debate over whether multinational corporations are paying their fair share around the world. The case drew outrage from Apple, with CEO Tim Cook calling it total political crap. Then-U.S. President Donald Trump slammed Vestager, who spearheaded the campaign to root out special tax deals and crack down on big U.S. tech companies, as the tax lady who really hates the U.S. Source: AP --Agencies",

ITAK had initially decided on September 01 to support the presidential candidate of the Samagi Jana Balawegaya-led alliance, Sajith Premadasa, as communicated by TNA MP M.A. Sumanthiran during a press briefing on the same day. Sumanthiran had pointed out that this decision was reached at the partys Central Committee meeting. However, the representatives of ITAKs Kilinochchi branch had called a special meeting last Monday and unanimously decided to support the Tamil common candidate, P. Ariyanenthiran. Meanwhile, President Ranil Wickremesinghe had met with ITAK leader Mavai Senathirajah at his residence in Kankasanthurai, Jaffna, on September 07 for a discussion.

        "date": "September 11, 2024 05:09 pm",
        "content": "Former Health Minister Keheliya Rambukwella and two other suspects, implicated in the alleged importation of substandard human immunoglobulin vials, have been released on bail by the Maligakanda Magistrates Court. The 7th accused in the case former Deputy Director of the Health Ministry Rathnakumara Herath and the 12th accused, former CEO of the National Medicines Regulatory Authority Dr. Vijith Gunasekera were also released on bail today. Rambukwella has been ordered released on two personal bails of Rs. 5 million each and a cash bond of Rs. 100,000. The court ordered that one of the bail signatories for the personal bail must be a close relative of the defendant. Meanwhile, the Maligakanda Magistrate Lochani Abeywickramahas also imposed a foreign travel ban on the former minister, who has been ordered to hand over his passport. Deputy Solicitor General Lakmini Girihagama, who appeared on behalf of the Attorney General, had requested the court to arrange for the accused to be sent to the Colombo National Hospital or the National Institute of Mental Health under judicial supervision to obtain mental treatment and cardiac treatment related to his illness if the remanded former minister cannot be treated at the Prison Hospital. However, the Magistrate rejected the request and stated that Mr. Keheliya Rambukwella would be granted bail in consideration of his medical condition. The Criminal Investigation Department (CID) arrested Rambukwella on 02 February over his alleged complicity in the procurement of substandard IVIG vials while he was ordered remanded the following day. The former minister has remained in remand custody until today (11). The arrest came hot on the heels of pressure from civil society activists and health sector trade unionists, who called for the immediate apprehension of the lawmaker. In October 2023, the National Medicines Regulatory Authority (NMRA) revealed that forged documents were found to have been submitted for Customs clearance to procure a batch of vials containing human immunoglobulin, an antibody produced by blood plasma cells, which later failed the quality tests. Prior to the apprehension of Rambukwella, seven arrests had been made in connection with the alleged drug procurement scam. But the fifth accused was later released on bail. As such, the former Health Secretary, former Additional Health Secretary, the Director of the Health Ministrys Medical Supplies Division (MSD) and three other officials of the same division, as well as the owner of the company, which is said to have supplied the substandard batch of immunoglobulin vials, were arrested and remanded over the case. Meanwhile, one of the suspects in the case, former Deputy Director of the Medical Supplies Division of the Health Ministry, Dr. Thusitha Sudarshana, was released on bail when the case was previously taken up on May 06. Meanwhile, the Court of Appeal on July 25 ordered the Maligakanda Magistrates Court to release on bail the former Director of the Health Ministrys Medical Supplies Division, Dr. Kapila Wickramanayake, who was also in remand custody. Accordingly, a total of 12 suspects had been arrested and remanded over the case while presently all but one of them are out on bail. The first accused, the owner of the company that supplied the substandard drugs, Sudath Janaka Fernando is receiving treatment while under remand custody.",

        "date": "September 11, 2024 06:30 pm",
        "content": "Taylor Swift, one of the music industrys biggest stars, endorsed Kamala Harris for president shortly after the presidential debate ended. I think she is a steady-handed, gifted leader and I believe we can accomplish so much more in this country if we are led by calm and not chaos, Swift wrote late Tuesday in an Instagram post, which included a link to a voter registration website. Swift has a dedicated following among young women, a key demographic in the November election, and her latest tour has generated more than 1 billion in ticket sales. In a half hour, the post received more than 2.3 million likes. She included a picture of herself holding her cat Benjamin Button, and she signed the message Childless Cat Lady. The remark is a reference to three-year-old comments made by JD Vance, Donald Trumps running mate, about women without children not having an equal stake in the countrys future. A Harris senior campaign official said the endorsement was not coordinated with the campaign. Tim Walz, Harris running mate, appeared to learn about the endorsement in the middle of a live interview on MSNBC. As Rachel Maddow read the text, Walz broke into a smile and patted his chest. That was eloquent. And it was clear, Walz said. And thats the kind of courage we need in America to stand up. Swift wrote that her endorsement was partially prompted by Trumps decision to post artificial intelligence-generated pictures suggesting that she had endorsed him. One showed Swift dressed as Uncle Sam, and the text said Taylor wants YOU to VOTE for DONALD TRUMP. Trumps posts brought me to the conclusion that I need to be very transparent about my actual plans for this election as a voter, Swift wrote. She added that Ive done my research, and Ive made my choice. Trump said Wednesday that Swifts move was just a question of time. He told Fox  Friends that Swift is a very liberal person who seems to always endorse a Democrat and shell probably pay a price in the marketplace. In 2020, she supported Democrat Joe Biden, and she cheered for Harris in her debate against then-Vice President Mike Pence. She also was openly critical of Trump, saying he had stoked the fires of white supremacy and racism. Swift is a popular figure nationwide, but especially among Democrats. An October 2023 Fox News poll found that 55 of voters overall, including 68 of Democrats, said they had a favorable view of Swift. Republicans were divided, with 43 having a favorable opinion and 45 an unfavorable one. AP VoteCast suggests that a partisan divide on Swift was apparent as early as 2018. Thats the year Swift made her first political endorsement, supporting Tennessee Democrat Phil Bredesen for Senate over Republican Marsha Blackburn. VoteCast found that among Tennessee voters that year, 55 of Democrats and just 19 of Republicans said they had a favorable opinion of Swift. Blackburn won by a comfortable margin in the deep red state. Swift is the leading nominee at Wednesdays MTV Video Music Awards. While its unclear whether Swift will attend the show in New York, she could use any acceptance speeches to elaborate on her support of Harris. The event was shifted a day later to accommodate Tuesdays debate. MTV has a long history of encouraging voter participation. Source: AP --Agencies",

        "date": "September 11, 2024 07:26 pm",
        "content": "A flash flood swept away an entire hamlet in northern Vietnam, killing 30 people and leaving dozens missing as deaths from a typhoon and its aftermath climbed to 155 on Wednesday. Vietnamese state broadcaster VTV said the torrent of water gushing down from a mountain in Lao Cai province Tuesday buried Lang Nu hamlet with 35 families in mud and debris. Only about a dozen are known so far to have survived. Rescuers have recovered 30 bodies and are continuing the search for about 65 others. The death toll from Typhoon Yagi and its aftermath has climbed to 155. Another 141 people are missing and hundreds were injured, VTV said. Floods and landslides have caused most of the deaths, many of which have come in the northwestern Lao Cai province, bordering China, where Lang Nu is located. Lao Cai province is also home to the popular trekking destination of Sapa. Many roads in the province were blocked by landslides and unrelenting rainfall, said Sapa tour guide Van A Po. The weather has forced them to limit travel with all trekking suspended. It is very scary, he said. Tourism is a key engine for the local economy, and many in the industry found themselves stranded. Nguyen Van Luong, who works in a hotel, said he couldnt return home since the 15-kilometer (9-mile) road from Sapa to his village was too dangerous to drive. The road is badly damaged and landslides could happen anytime. My family told me to stay here until its safer to go home. On Monday, a bridge collapsed and a bus was swept away by flooding, killing dozens of people. The steel bridge in Phu Tho province over the engorged Red River collapsed, sending 10 cars and trucks along with two motorbikes into the river. The bus carrying 20 people was swept into a flooded stream by a landslide in mountainous Cao Bang province. Yagi was the strongest typhoon to hit the Southeast Asian country in decades. It made landfall Saturday with winds of up to 149 kph (92 mph). Despite weakening on Sunday, downpours have continued and rivers remain dangerously high. The heavy rains also damaged factories in export-focused northern Vietnams industrial hubs. Storms like Typhoon Yagi are getting stronger due to climate change, primarily because warmer ocean waters provide more energy to fuel the storms, leading to increased wind speeds and heavier rainfall, said Benjamin Horton, director of the Earth Observatory of Singapore.

        "content": "Sri Lanka mens cricket team fielding coach, Anton Roux, announced that he is stepping down from his position. Roux, a former South African first-class cricketer and former coach of the Netherlands, took on the role with Sri Lanka in March 2022. On the 14th of August 2024, I decided to step down from my role as the National Fielding Coach for Sri Lanka Cricket. This week will be my last with SLC as I finish my handover. It has been an immense honour and a truly humbling experience to serve the Sri Lankan national cricket team. I will forever cherish the memories and experiences that came with this journey. Witnessing the resilience and unity of the Sri Lankan people during times of crisis, especially during the incredible series win against Australia on home soil, was a testament to what this nation, and team, can achieve when it comes together. The electric atmosphere, the passion of the fans, and the triumphs on the field will remain etched in my memory, wrote Roux in a post on LinkedIn. It means the third and final Test at the Oval, where Sri Lanka beat England by eight wickets at the Oval, as the visitors claimed their maiden win in the longer format over the hosts in a decade, was Rouxs final international game in the national fielding coach role. He further talked about being a witness to what all Sri Lanka achieved in his tenure as a fielding coach. Reaching two Asia Cup finals, and ultimately winning the 2022 Asia T20 Cup, was a spectacular achievement that demonstrated the true potential of this team. Bringing that trophy back to Sri Lanka and seeing the joy it brought to the fans is something I will cherish for a long time. I also had the privilege of spending a short period of time with the Sri Lanka Womens Cricket Team, and I was deeply impressed by their hunger to learn, passion to play and compete, and their athletic ability in the field. They have grown from strength to strength and have become a beacon of hope and inspiration for women in Sri Lanka. Their progress has been remarkable, and I have no doubt that they will continue to achieve great things in the future. Roux also expressed gratitude to the people who made his life in Sri Lanka unforgettable. Sri Lanka has also become a part of my familys story. It is the country of birth for my second son, Aiden, and the love and care we received at Joseph Fraser Hospital in Colombo will always be a fond memory and a lasting connection to this beautiful country.

        "date": "September 12, 2024 07:36 am",
        "content": "The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has approved a 100 million policy-based loan to support Sri Lankas water supply and sanitation sector reforms to enhance the countrys resilience to climate change impacts and promote long-term sustainability. The Water Supply and Sanitation Reform Program, composed of two subprograms of 100 million each, will contribute to a more resilient and sustainable delivery of water supply and sanitation services. Subprogram 1 will establish policies and strategies nationally and for the National Water Supply and Drainage Board (NWSDB) while the subprogram 2 will support the implementation of reform actions and guidelines. Efficient delivery of safe and reliable water supply in Sri Lanka is limited by fragmented water resources management and exacerbated by climate change. This significantly affects the daily life of Sri Lankansmany of whom do not have access to piped water supply, said Senior Urban Development Specialist Pedro Almeida. This program will not only strengthen mechanisms to ensure adequate access to safe water but also address governance and sustainability challenges of the sector that will enable the participation of the private sector. Water resources management in the country faces longstanding challenges such as unbalanced allocation between agriculture and drinking water, inadequate climate change consideration in planning and development, involvement of several agencies at national and regional level, and impacts from unplanned land use and deforestation. To strengthen water resources management, climate resilience and environmental sustainability of water supply operations, subprogram 1 is supporting the National Water Resources Policy approved by the Prime Ministers Office to ensure adequate procedures are in place for equitable water allocation and sharing. Other measures promoted include national policies to ensure access to safe drinking water, gender-sensitive and inclusive water service delivery, and a climate change roadmap. Subprogram 1 is also helping to enhance the efficiency and performance of the sector through the Ministry of Water Supply and Estate Infrastructure Developments (MWS) approval of a climate-resilient project appraisal framework for investments in the drinking water sector, and NWSDBs financial sustainability, efficiency, and performance through financial sustainability and public-private sector roadmaps, and a business efficiency action plan. The program comes with 800,000 of technical assistance grant that will provide capacity and advisory support to MWS and NWSDB for the formulation, deployment, implementation, and monitoring of the reform initiatives in the next subprogram. ADBs Technical Assistance Special Fund will cover 500,000 of the amount while the Water Innovation Trust Fund, under the Water Financing Partnership Facility administered by ADB, will finance 300,000.

        "title": "Perus Fujimori, divisive head of political dynasty, dies age 86",
        "date": "September 12, 2024 08:34 am",
        "content": "Former Peruvian president Alberto Fujimori, who steered economic growth during the 1990s but was later jailed for human rights abuses stemming from a bloody war against Maoist rebels, died on Wednesday. He was aged 86. Close colleagues visited him earlier in the day, reporting that he was in a critical condition. After a long battle with cancer, our father... has just departed to meet the Lord, his daughter Keiko Fujimori wrote in a message on X, also signed by the former leaders other children. Fujimori, the son of Japanese immigrants, was the little-known chancellor of a farming university when elected to office in 1990. He quickly established himself as a cunning politician whose hands-on style produced results even as he angered critics for concentrating power. He slayed hyperinflation that had thrown millions of Peruvians out of work, privatized dozens of state-run companies and slashed trade tariffs, setting the foundations for Peru to become, for a while, one of Latin Americas most stable economies. Under his watch, the feared leader of the Maoist Shining Path, Abimael Guzman, was captured - dealing a crucial blow to a movement that in the 1980s seemed close to toppling the Peruvian state. Guzman died in prison in September 2021. But many Peruvians saw Fujimori as an autocrat after he used military tanks to shut down Congress in 1992, redrafting the constitution to his liking to push free-market reforms and tough anti-terrorism laws. A slew of corruption scandals during his 10-year administration also turned public opinion against him. Shortly after he won a third election in 2000 - amending the constitution to run - videos emerged of his top adviser and spy chief Vladimiro Montesinos doling out cash to bribe politicians. Fujimori fled to exile in Japan. He resigned via fax from Tokyo and then unsuccessfully campaigned for a Japanese senatorial seat. Montesinos was later captured in Venezuela and jailed, convicted by the hundreds of videos he recorded of himself handing out cash bribes to politicians and business and media executives. The cases against Fujimori piled up - including accusations that he had ordered the use of death squads in his battle against Shining Path militants. Fujimori was safe in Japan - he was a dual citizen and Japan does not extradite its citizens. So many were shocked when in 2005 he decided to head back to Peru, apparently in hopes of forgiveness and a return to politics. Instead, he was detained during a layover in Chile, extradited to Peru in 2007, and in 2009 he was convicted and sentenced to 25 years in prison. Fuji-Shock Once jailed, Fujimoris public appearances were limited to hospital visits where he often appeared disheveled and unwell. While detractors dismissed his health complaints as a ploy to get out of prison, then-president Pedro Pablo Kuczynski briefly pardoned Fujimori in 2017. Months later Kuczynski was impeached and the pardon overturned by Perus top constitutional court, sending Fujimori back to the special prison that held him and no other inmates. The court restored the pardon in December 2023, releasing the ailing Fujimori, who had suffered from stomach ulcers, hypertension and tongue cancer. In May 2024, Fujimori announced he had been diagnosed with a malignant tumor. Fujimoris legacy has been most passionately defended by his daughter Keiko, who has been close to clinching the presidency herself three times on a platform that has included pardoning her father and defending his constitution. Outside Fujimoris residence on Wednesday evening supporters gathered to mourn and pray. Today, I weep for a leader, Fujimori backer Cesar Valverde said. He should have been president again; we were working for Alberto Fujimori to be president again, but God has taken him. Keiko had said in July that her father planned to run for the presidency again in the 2026 election. The late Fujimori was born in Lima on Peruvian Independence Day, July 28, 1938. A mathematician and agricultural engineer, Fujimori was a political nobody when he decided to run for the presidency, driving a tractor to his campaign rallies. He surprised the world by defeating renowned writer Mario Vargas Llosa in the 1990 election, with heavy support from the left. He touted himself as an alternative to the countrys white elite and gained crucial support from Perus large Indigenous and mixed-race populations. As Peru battled what was among the worlds worst hyperinflation, Fujimori promised not to carry out drastic measures to tame it. But on his second week in office he suddenly lifted the subsidies that kept food essentials affordable, in what became known as the Fuji-shock. May God help us, Fujimoris finance minister said on TV after announcing the measure. Inflation worsened in the short-term but the bet paid off, eventually stabilizing the economy after more than a decade of crisis. Even as support for him started to wane, Fujimori pulled off audacious stunts in his second term. In 1997, he devised a plan to dig tunnels under the Japanese ambassadors residence in Lima to end a four-month hostage crisis after another insurgency, the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement, took 500 people captive for 126 days. In a surprise attack, Fujimori sent in more than 100 commandos in a raid that killed all 14 insurgents. Only two commandos and one of the remaining 72 hostages died. Television footage showed Fujimori calmly stepping over the corpses of the insurgents after the raid. Fujimori was married twice. A public falling-out with his first wife Susana Higuchi while he was president led him to name daughter Keiko as the first lady. The couple had three other children, including Kenji Fujimori, also a politician. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

Thats the country... do you not want a country like that? That is what we are leading, he said, adding that it is not something an immature individual like Sajith Premadasa can accomplish. Dissanayake also accused Premadasa of making promises about what he will give people wherever he goes. If someone like him were in your village, would you elect them to the local council? No, right?

        "date": "September 12, 2024 12:42 pm",
        "content": "Nearly 200 people have died in Vietnam in the aftermath of Typhoon Yagi and more than 125 are missing as flash floods and landslides take their toll, state media reported Thursday. Vietnams VNExpress newspaper reported that 197 people have died and 128 are still missing, while more than 800 have been injured. In the capital, flood waters from the Red River receded slightly but many areas were still inundated. In Hanois Tay Ho district, people waded through muddy brown water above their knees to make their way along one street, some still wearing their bicycle and motorcycle helmets after abandoning their vehicles along the way. A few paddled along the road in small boats as empty water bottles, a stryofoam cooler and other flotsam drifted by; one man pushed his motorbike toward drier ground in an aluminum sloop. Pedestrians hiked up their shorts as high as possible to avoid being soaked by the wake caused by a delivery truck powering its way through the water. Yagi was the strongest typhoon to hit the Southeast Asian country in decades. It made landfall Saturday with winds of up to 149 kph (92 mph). Despite weakening on Sunday, downpours continued and rivers remain dangerously high. The flooding in Hanoi has been reportedly the worst in two decades, and has led to widespread evacuations. The death toll spiked earlier in the week as a flash flood swept away the entire hamlet of Lang Nu in northern Vietnams Lao Cai province Tuesday. Hundreds of rescue personnel worked tirelessly Wednesday to search for survivors, but as of Thursday morning 53 villagers remained missing, VNExpress reported, while seven more bodies were found, bringing the death toll there to 42. Floods and landslides have caused most of the deaths, many of which have come in the northwestern Lao Cai province, bordering China, where Lang Nu is located. Lao Cai province is also home to the popular trekking destination of Sapa. On Monday, a bridge collapsed and a bus was swept away by flooding, killing dozens of people. The steel bridge in Phu Tho province over the engorged Red River collapsed, sending 10 cars and trucks along with two motorbikes into the river. The bus carrying 20 people was swept into a flooded stream by a landslide in mountainous Cao Bang province. Experts say storms like Typhoon Yagi are getting stronger due to climate change, as warmer ocean waters provide more energy to fuel them, leading to higher winds and heavier rainfall.

        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe has slammed the sudden promises from presidential candidates Sajith Premadasa and Anura Kumara Dissanayake about reducing fertilizer prices and cutting farmers loans, questioning as to where they were when farmers were struggling without access to fertilizers. The President highlighted that his efforts, including discussions with world leaders to secure fertilizer subsidies, were instrumental in getting farmers back to their fields and boosting rice production in the country. Today, promises are being made to lower fertilizer prices and erase farmers debts. Yet, when farmers were in urgent need of fertilizer, those promises were not fulfilled. I ask Sajith and Anura, where were you then? I have worked to stabilize the countrys economy through tough and often unpopular decisions. I reopened businesses that had closed, and now we have achieved economic stability, he said. President Wickremesinghe claimed that Sajith and Anura, who now speak about alleviating the peoples burdens, offered no support during the economic crisis when the country needed it most. He charged that those who avoided responsibility during the crisis are now seeking power for themselves. President Wickremesinghe made these remarks during an election rally in Sainthamaruthu, Ampara yesterday (11). During his speech, the President emphasized the importance of trade and farming, which are vital sources of income for the Muslim community in the country. He warned that losing these sectors could lead to serious difficulties for the people. He urged attendees to seek out the SLMC for support in strengthening these crucial areas, and assured them that he has concrete plans to address these issues. The President also highlighted his commitment to conducting elections free from ethnic and religious biases. He affirmed that the legal right of Muslim citizens to be buried according to their customs is protected, contrasting his approach with that of other leaders who engage in divisive rhetoric on the campaign trail. Instead, President Wickremesinghe promised to fulfil his commitments and work towards the betterment of all communities.",

        "date": "September 12, 2024 07:26 pm",
        "content": "Sri Lankas opposition leader contesting the presidential election next week said Thursday that if he comes to power he will renegotiate with the International Monetary Fund the 2022 economic reforms package to ensure that the rich pay more taxes and the poor see their conditions improve. The reforms were introduced after Sri Lanka defaulted on its foreign debt creating the worst economic crisis in its history. Sajith Premadasa, the opposition leader in Parliament told The Associated Press in an interview that his party has already started discussions with the IMF to find ways to ease the tax burden on the people. We will be embarking on the third path, the middle path, the path is where wealth is created, the country grows and the wealth is equitably distributed, Premadasa said. He said there needs to be fundamental changes to the current agreement between the IMF and Sri Lankas government but those should be in a more humanistic manner to ensure that the burden on the people is lessened. And if there are burdens that have to be imposed, the super-rich and the rich have to disproportionately take a bigger share of the burden rather than the working men and women of Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka is in the middle of reforms and a debt restructuring program under an IMF agreement whereby taxes have been increased to boost state revenue. After the island nation defaulted on its foreign debt in 2022, borrowing was reduced and the printing of new currency notes was stopped by law. The opposition parties say however that many of the wealthy and those with connections with the authorities dont pay their taxes and the burden is borne by the middle classes and the poor through income taxes and value-added tax on goods and services. The presidential election on September 21 is seen as a referendum on the reforms initiated by President Ranil Wickremesinghe. They have improved key economic figures, but their effects have yet to reach many ordinary people. Premadasa criticized Wickremesinghes economic policies saying that he is trying to find solutions through contraction. Premadasa said his policy is to grow out of the problem through an export-oriented, knowledge-based economy. Premadasa, 57, is the son of a former president late Ranasinghe Premadasa who was assassinated by a suicide bomber in 1993. He also contested the presidential election in 2019 and lost to Gotabaya Rajapaksa, who was forced to flee after two years amid angry protests against the countrys economic meltdown. Unsustainable debt, a severe balance of payments crisis, the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the governments spending of scarce foreign reserves to prop up the countrys currency, the rupee, led to a severe shortage of foreign currency and essentials such as fuel, medicine, cooking gas and food in 2022. It sparked riots, forcing Rajapaksa to flee the country and later resign. Sri Lankas parliament elected Wickremesinghe as president to cover Rajapaksas remaining time. Wickremesinghe is also contesting the election and is seeking approval for his economic agenda, promising rapid growth with an ambitious target of making Sri Lanka a developed nation by the centenary of its independence in 2048. Inflation dropped to 0.5 last month from 70 two years ago under Wickremesinghes administration. Interest rates have also come down, the rupee has rebounded, and foreign currency reserves have increased. Creditor countries such as India, Japan and France have agreed to defer debt repayments until 2028, giving the island nation space to rebuild its economy. But professionals have been complaining of high taxes and all especially the poor have been affected by high living costs. Premadasa, one of the three leading candidates from a total of 38, said that he would prosecute those in the Rajapaksa administration who ordered cremating the dead bodies of Muslim COVID-19 victims, ignoring their religious sentiments at the height of the pandemic and pay compensation to their families. Authorities then had mandated cremation of the COVID-19 victims citing health and soil experts who had cautioned that the deadly virus could contaminate ground water. Premadasa however called it a racist policy. Premadasa also said that he would allow maximum devolution of power to the ethnic Tamil majority in the northern and eastern provinces, a long-standing demand from the community. He also promised to call an international donor conference to help rebuild areas affected by a 26-year separatist civil war in those provinces. Premadasa also said he would bring closure to the issue of forcible disappearances and those who went missing in action. Source: Associated Press --Agencies",

        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe announced that the country will soon see the establishment of numerous new educational institutions, both public and private. These new institutions will provide young people with opportunities for higher education that meet global standards, he said. The President made this statement during a ceremony on Thursday (12) at the Galle Face Hotel, Colombo, where he inaugurated the Times School of Higher Education. The President stated that they plan to allocate government funds to support 50,000 youths in receiving vocational training at recognized institutions. We have the capability to establish such institutions to provide this training, complementing existing training programs. He stated that as the country develops over the coming years, increased investment opportunities and the creation of new industries are expected to generate approximately 100,000 new jobs in both the public and private sectors.

        "date": "September 13, 2024 08:39 am",
        "content": "Republican nominee Donald Trump said on Thursday he would not participate in another presidential debate against Kamala Harris ahead of the Nov. 5 election, after several polls showed his Democratic rival won their debate earlier this week. THERE WILL BE NO THIRD DEBATE! the former president wrote on social media site Truth Social. Trump had participated in a debate against President Joe Biden in June before his debate against Harris on Tuesday. Although Trump touted his performance on Tuesday against Harris, six Republican donors and three Trump advisers who spoke to Reuters earlier this week said they thought Harris had won the debate largely because Trump was unable to stay on message. The debate attracted 67.1 million television viewers, according to Nielsen data. Harris, speaking at a rally shortly after Trumps post went live, said: I believe we owe it to the voters to have another debate. While Trump said in his post that polls showed he won the debate, several surveys showed that respondents thought Harris did better. Among voters who said they had heard at least something about Tuesdays debate, 53 said Harris won and 24 said Trump won, according to a ReutersIpsos poll released on Thursday. The poll showed that 54 of registered voters believed that the single debate between Trump and Harris was enough, while 46 had wanted a second debate. A majority of debate watchers said Harris outperformed Trump, according to a CNN flash poll released shortly after the debate. YouGov showed 54 of those surveyed said Harris won while 31 said Trump was the victor. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "date": "September 13, 2024 09:21 am",
        "content": "A crew of four aboard a SpaceX capsule embarked on the worlds first private spacewalk on Thursday, as an astronaut eased out of the Crew Dragon spacecraft on a tether into the vacuum of space, hundreds of miles from Earth. Billionaire Jared Isaacman, 41, exited first about 6:52 a.m. ET (1052 GMT). After he returned a few minutes later, SpaceX engineer Sarah Gillis, 30, was scheduled to take her turn in space, all their maneuvers streaming live on the companys website. Back at home we all have a lot of work to do, but from here, Earth sure looks like a perfect world, Isaacman said after emerging from the spacecraft, the planet glittering in half shadow below him. Before the spacewalk began, the capsule was completely depressurized, with the whole crew relying on their slim, SpaceX-developed spacesuits for oxygen, provided via an umbilical connection to Crew Dragon. The spacewalk was scheduled to last only about 30 minutes, but the procedures to prepare for it and to finish it safely last about two hours. It was meant to test the new spacesuit designs and procedures for the capsule, among other things. Isaacman, Gillis, Scott Poteet, 50, a retired U.S. Air Force lieutenant colonel, and SpaceX engineer Anna Menon, 38, had been orbiting Earth aboard Crew Dragon since Tuesdays pre-dawn launch from Florida of the Polaris Dawn mission. Menon and Poteet remained inside the spacecraft during the spacewalk. It is the Elon Musk-led companys latest and riskiest bid to push the boundaries of commercial spaceflight. Isaacman, a pilot and the billionaire founder of electronic payments company Shift4, is bankrolling the Polaris mission, as he did his Inspiration4 flight with SpaceX in 2021. He has declined to say how much he is paying, but the missions are likely to cost hundreds of millions of dollars, based on Crew Dragons price of roughly 55 million a seat for other flights. FARTHEST SINCE APOLLO Throughout Wednesday, the craft circled Earth at least six times in an oval orbit as shallow as 190 km (118 miles) and stretching out as far as 1,400 km (870 miles), the farthest in space that humans have traveled since the last U.S. Apollo mission in 1972. The gumdrop-shaped spacecraft then began to lower its orbit into a peak 700-km (435-mile) position and adjust cabin pressure to ready for the spacewalk, formally called Extravehicular Activity (EVA), the Polaris program said on social media on Wednesday. The crew also spent a few hours demonstrating the suits pressurized mobility, verifying positions and accessibility in microgravity along with preparing the cabin for the EVA, it said. Only government astronauts with several years of training have done spacewalks in the past. There have been roughly 270 on the International Space Station (ISS) since it was set up in 2000, and 16 by Chinese astronauts on Beijings Tiangong space station. The Polaris crew has spent 2-12 years training with SpaceX mission simulations and experiential learning in challenging, uncomfortable environments, said Poteet. A record 19 astronauts are now in orbit, after Russias Soyuz MS-26 mission ferried two cosmonauts and a U.S. astronaut to the International Space Station on Wednesday, taking its headcount to 12. Three Chinese astronauts are aboard the Tiangong space station. The first U.S. spacewalk in 1965, aboard a Gemini capsule, used a similar procedure to the one planned for Polaris Dawn: the capsule was depressurized, the hatch opened, and a spacesuited astronaut ventured outside on a tether. Since 2001, Crew Dragon, the only U.S. vehicle capable of reliably putting humans in orbit and returning them to Earth, has flown more than a dozen astronaut missions, mainly for NASA. The agency seeded development of the capsule under a program meant to establish commercial, privately-built U.S. vehicles capable of ferrying astronauts with the ISS. Also developed under that program was Boeings Starliner capsule, but it is farther behind. Starliner launched its first astronauts to the ISS in June in a troubled test mission that ended this month with the capsule returning empty, leaving its crew on the space station for a Crew Dragon capsule to fetch next year.

        "content": "The Election Commission has announced that the vehicles carrying representatives of presidential candidates will be permitted to escort the vehicles transporting ballot boxes from polling stations to counting centers. This aims to address concerns raised by some politicians and candidates regarding the integrity of the ballot boxes during transit. According to the commission, representatives may follow the vehicle carrying the ballot boxes up to the last police checkpoint near the counting center. However, in order to be allowed to escort such vehicles, an authorized representative of the candidate must submit a detailed report to the District Election Office three days before polling day. This report should include the name of the relevant polling station, the vehicle number of the escorting vehicle, and the name of the representative on board. A vehicle license for this purpose can be obtained from the Senior Polling Officer at the relevant polling station. This decision comes in response to doubts expressed about whether the ballot boxes will be delivered to the counting center without any tampering after the polls close, the commission said. Meanwhile, the Election Commission has reported that the number of complaints related to the presidential election has exceeded 3,500. Between July 31 and 4:30 p.m. yesterday (Sep. 12), a total of 3,610 complaints were received, of which 3,047 have been resolved thus far, it said.",

        "date": "September 13, 2024 10:58 am",
        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe stated that all political parties, except his own, are responsible for the current state of the country. He accused the JVP of deceiving the public by pretending to distance themselves from past armed rebellions, asserting that this is a misleading tactic. The President criticized the JVP for repeating the mistake of making unrealistic promises and questioned whether it is wise to entrust the countrys future to a group unwilling to acknowledge their past errors. These remarks were made by President Wickremesinghe during the Puluwan Peraliya program held yesterday (12) at The Stables in Park Street Mews, Colombo. Emphasizing the importance of the upcoming election, Wickremesinghe warned that the 2024 presidential election represents the last opportunity for national rebuilding. He cautioned that further economic struggles could make recovery nearly impossible, underscoring the critical nature of this election in shaping the future of the nation. Wickremesinghe criticized the JVPs failure to define a clear economic strategy, stating, What about the NPPs manifesto? They dont have clear answers. Are they for an export-oriented economy or an import substitution economy? They cant answer that question. Ive asked them to clarify so we can have a meaningful debate, but they avoid it. The President also questioned the trustworthiness of leaders who refuse to admit past mistakes. As politicians, weve made mistakes, promising the people everything when we didnt have the resources to deliver. We didnt always tell the truth, but at least we are admitting our errors now. If you cant admit your past mistakes, how can you be trusted with the future? Wickremesinghe further described the JVPs manifesto as filled with vague and impractical commitments. He noted that their manifesto is excessively lengthy and largely consists of general statements. He specifically challenged their claim to recover stolen money, pointing out that the Anti-Corruption Act does not support such recovery. They dont even know weve introduced a second piece of legislation, the Proceeds of Crime Bill. And even if they manage to catch someone next year, it would take five years before a case is resolved. So, for 2025, their plans are pure nonsense, he said.",

The Criminal Investigation Department (CID) had arrested Sanjeewa Mahanama for allegedly assisting in the orchestrated shooting targeting the vehicle of former parliamentarian Uddika Premaratne. On June 14, Sri Lanka Police said that investigations had uncovered that the incident where several gunshots had been fired at the vehicle belonging to then-Anuradhapura District MP Uddika Premaratne, had been staged by the actor-turned-politician himself with the help of the Anuradhapura ASP. On September 17, 2023, it was initially reported that a group of unidentified gunmen had opened fire at Premaratnes car soon after he returned to his residence in Anuradhapura at around 10:35 p.m. and that the parliamentarian had managed to escape unharmed. It was claimed that the perpetrators, who had arrived in a car, had targeted the parliamentarian who was walking towards the house after parking his vehicle. The left rear door glass of Premaratnes car was damaged in the shooting incident for which the gunmen were believed to have used a pistol, it was reported. Anuradhapura police initiated investigations soon after the incident was reported and Special Task Force (STF) personnel were deployed to beef up the security near the MPs house. Later, investigations into the matter were handed over to the Criminal Investigation Department (CID). Later on 27 February 2024, the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) MP resigned as a Member of Parliament, following which S.C. Muthukumarana of SLPP was appointed to fill the vacant MP seat. However, Premaratne was later reported to have travelled to Canada, seeking political asylum, which he refuted, and claimed that he was expecting a work visa in Canada. In 2020, the popular actor was announced as a candidate for the 2020 parliamentary election from the Anuradhapura District as a member of the Sri Lanka Peoples Freedom Alliance, a political alliance led by the SLPP formed in 2019. He obtained 133,550 votes and won a seat in the 16th Parliament of Sri Lanka.",

This fine is reportedly the highest ever imposed for a wildlife crime in Sri Lanka. The decision was recently delivered by Tissamaharama Magistrate Tharindu Sameera de Silva. The two Italians, 68-year-old Luigi Ferrari and his 28-year-old son, were arrested on May 8 this year by Yala National Park rangers with several jars containing the insects. Initially, 810 charges were brought against them, but this was later reduced to 304. The defense, represented by a team of lawyers from various regions, requested for leniency and the imposing of a minimum fine on their clients. However, the Magistrate stated that the case was expedited and the necessary expert reports were swiftly obtained as the defendants are foreign nationals. The court ruled that the defendants were guilty of all 304 charges under the Fauna and Flora Protection Ordinance. The court ordered the accused to pay the fine by September 29 and they are prohibited from leaving the country until the full amount is paid.",

        "title": "IMF to move forward with Sri Lanka program discussions after presidential poll",
        "date": "September 13, 2024 07:36 pm",
        "content": "The International Monetary Fund (IMF) says that the timing of Sri Lankas Third Review under the Extended Fund Facility will be discussed with the government following the elections and that they will move forward with program discussions after the countrys presidential election. Responding to questions during the weekly press briefing, the Director of the IMFs Communications Department, Julie Kozack stated that the IMF Executive Board completed the 2024 Article IV Consultation and the Second Review of the EFF program on June 12, 2024. She stated that this provided the country with access of about 336 million U.S. dollars. Program performance remains strong. Reform efforts are bearing fruit. Economic growth is starting to revive. Inflation is coming down. Reserves, international reserves are increasing, and revenue mobilization is improving. Nonetheless, she stated that important vulnerabilities do remain, and that sustaining reform momentum is going to be essential. In response to specific questions regarding the island nations presidential election, slated to be held on September 21, the spokesman said that its very important to note that for the upcoming elections, it is really for the people of Sri Lanka to decide. Kozack noted that achieving the programs objectives is a key priority to give Sri Lanka a chance to emerge from one of its worst crises in history. As Ive already noted, a lot of progress has been made, but the country is not out of the woods yet, and it is important to safeguard those hard won gains, she said. Responding to a query with respect to debt restructuring, the spokesman said that the IMF does not take part in the negotiations. In the debt restructuring negotiations and discussions, those negotiations are between the member country and its creditors, with the IMF making an overall assessment of debt sustainability. Kozack was also asked about the statements by Sri Lankas opposition factions that the debt sustainability assessment (DSA), with regard to the EFF program, will be renegotiated or revisited after the presidential election. First, with respect to the upcoming presidential elections, this is for the people of Sri Lanka to decide. From the IMFs position, what we see is a program that has made significant achievements, but that it is important to safeguard these achievements to enable the country to fully emerge from one of its worst crises, she said. The IMF spokesman pointed out that the timing of the Third Review of Sri Lankas EFF program will be discussed with the government following the elections. So, we will move forward with program discussions after the presidential elections take place and a new government, or the outcome based on the choice of the people, we will be ready to go with that, she said.",

        "title": "Nothing will be derailed but everything would be humanized  Sajith on renegotiating IMF deal",
        "date": "September 13, 2024 09:45 pm",
        "content": "Sri Lankas main opposition leader said hell reopen negotiations with the International Monetary Fund on its 3 billion loan if he wins next weeks presidential election to ease the financial burden on working class people. Sajith Premadasa, 57, wants rich individuals to bear more of the cost of the economic adjustment that came with the bailout program. The austerity measures that were imposed, such as tax and electricity-price hikes, and the debt restructuring, have made the incumbent leader Ranil Wickremesinghe deeply unpopular, creating a tight race for the Sept. 21 vote. We will make sure there is justice and fairness, Premadasa said in an interview in his Colombo office. The burden should be shared by the super rich, not the working class poor. The election will be the first for the country since an economic crisis in 2022 caused living standards to plunge and the government to default on its debt for the first time ever. Widespread unrest that followed forced the populist Gotabaya Rajapaksa to flee the country and resign. His successor Wickremesinghe went on to negotiate the IMF bailout the following year. Premadasa, who runs a breakaway group that splintered from Wickremesinghes party in 2020, has emerged as one of the three leading candidates contesting an election that analysts say is too close to call. Hell face Wickremesinghe and Anura Kumara Dissanayake, a candidate with roots in Marxist socialist policy. Both Premadasa and Dissanayake have said theyll reopen negotiations with the IMF, adding to policy uncertainty. The IMF needs to conduct a third review of the loan program before it disburses the next tranche of funding, estimated at about 350 million. Sri Lankas government still hasnt finalized debt restructuring deals with some of its creditors two years after defaulting. Investors have in recent weeks started to cut their exposure to the nations dollar bonds amid concerns over further delays in the debt overhaul. The nations private creditors and government officials are holding a third round of talks this week to agree on the restructuring of 12.6 billion in defaulted bonds, Bloomberg News reported earlier, citing people familiar with the matter. The government is seeking to reach a final agreement on the debt before the election, one of the people said, adding that a statement with details on the ongoing negotiations may be released next week. Premadasa declined to give details of what hell seek to change in the IMF loan conditions, although he was critical of a domestic debt restructuring agreed to by the current administration, which he called dastardly unfair in its treatment of local pension funds. In an Aug. 2 statement, the IMF said that the timing of the programs third review will be discussed with the government after the polls. Julie Kozack, the IMFs chief spokesperson, reiterated that view on Thursday in Washington, saying we will move forward with program discussions after the presidential elections take place. Dhananath Fernando, chief executive officer of Advocata Institute, a Colombo-based think tank, said rising costs, including food price hikes, cant be fully attributed to the IMF program, and energy prices were raised to partly make up for the currencys depreciation. He noted that most food prices and energy costs have eased in the past two years, although lower-income consumers are still worse off compared to before the crisis. Boosting Exports Premadasa leads the Samagi Jana Sandhanaya and has previously held ministerial portfolios in government, including housing and health. His manifesto, titled Towards an Advanced Social Market Economy, champions boosting exports, reducing taxes, setting up an independent public prosecutor to tackle corruption and strengthening the rule of law. Export-driven economic development is one of our main mantras, Premadasa said in the interview on Wednesday. We would also have a purposeful effort to promote manufacturing industry, as it is of great importance to ensure that we have quality economic growth. Premadasa said he champions good governance and will strive to improve Sri Lankas business environment to help lure foreign direct investment. In a reference to popular leftist candidate Dissanayake, Premadasa said Marxist ideologies, and extreme hardline leftist tendencies will certainly not be the kind of situation which would attract FDI. Dissanayake is gaining momentum in the race on a campaign platform of eliminating corruption. His coalition of leftist parties and groups, backed by protesters who ousted the Rajapaksa government in 2022, opposes the debt restructuring framework agreed with the multilateral lender. Premadasa said the IMF program needs to be reworked to ensure a better outcome for citizens. We need to be very professional in our negotiations with the IMF and we will have a good deal, a strong deal, he said. Nothing will be derailed but everything would be humanized.
