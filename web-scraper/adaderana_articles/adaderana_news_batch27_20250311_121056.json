        "title": "Sri Lanka Budget seeks to balance poll pledges with IMF demands  Report",
        "date": "February 17, 2025 08:44 am",
        "content": "Sri Lanka President Anura Kumara Dissanayake will need to walk a tightrope in his budget Monday, seeking to reduce the economic burden on the poor while taking steps to keep a 3 billion International Monetary Fund bailout on track. Dissanayake, who is also the South Asian nations finance minister, is expected to lower income taxes and boost welfare spending when he delivers his first full budget since sweeping into power last year, providing some relief to citizens following an economic crisis in 2022. At the same time, hes expected to outline policies to boost revenue and build fiscal buffers to bolster the 85 billion economy. Investors are closely monitoring the budget speech for clarity on the governments fiscal consolidation path, especially measures to trim public-sector spending, privatization of state assets, and policies to attract investments. The IMF has projected Sri Lankas budget to hit a primary surplus of 2.3 of gross domestic product in 2025, from a target of 1 last year. To achieve that, the government will look to boost revenue from excise duties and lifting of restrictions on imported vehicles, while cutting wasteful spending. Meeting the IMF targets will help the government secure more funds and aid faster debt reduction. The lender expects the island nation to narrow its fiscal deficit to 5.2 in 2025 from 7.6 last year. The budget will set the economic roadmap for Sri Lanka in the coming years, said Saurav Anand, an economist at Standard Chartered Plc. in Mumbai. Foreign investors are likely to continue looking favorably at Sri Lanka if the authorities adhere to the IMF targets on fiscal consolidation and revenue generation, while pushing for an increase in capital spending, he said. Dissanayake, a leftist political outsider, won overwhelming support in the presidential election in September, followed shortly after by a historic super-majority victory by his National Peoples Power in the parliament, a rebuke to the nations political elite. His party has pledged to shore up anti-poverty programs and clamp down on corruption. Despite initially wanting to rewrite the IMF loan program, the new administration has so far avoided a clash with the Washington-based lender, saying a prolonged renegotiation would make it impossible to rebuild the economy. Sri Lanka secured initial approval for 333 million in funds from the IMF in November last year. Increased inflows from tourism and remittances have also aided Sri Lankas turnaround, with economic growth estimated at about 5 last year, and foreign foreign exchange reserves climbing to 6.1 billion from around 1.8 billion during the height of the crisis. The government also concluded a debt restructuring worth 12.6 billion, resulting in credit rating upgrades. The Sri Lankan rupee was Asias best performing currency last year, gaining over 10 in 2024, while the benchmark Colombo Stock Exchange All Share Index rose 53 since the new president took office in late September, outperforming more than 90 global stock indexes tracked by Bloomberg. Dissanayakes poll pledges would lower the primary balance surplus this year, wrote Bloomberg Economics Ankur Shukla in a note last week. Even so, he will likely remain mindful of meeting the revenue and primary balance targets set by the IMF. Source: Bloomberg --Agencies",

        "date": "February 17, 2025 09:02 am",
        "content": "The government has announced plans to increase the number of locomotive engines in operation daily to minimize train delays and cancellations. Following a visit to Ella, Deputy Minister of Transport and Highways Dr. Prasanna Gunasena stated that this initiative aims to enhance the quality of railway services. Before electric trains are introduced, Sri Lankas train cancellations must stop. There are about 217 to 220 trains running daily. In the past, about 17 to 20 of them were cancelled. We need to stop the cancellations as much as possible. We need to do everything we can to keep the train engines running, he said. Dr. Gunasena further stated that Sri Lanka requires about 60 to 70 train engines for daily operations, but only 45 to 50 engines are currently available. He further assured that efforts are being made to increase this number, and progress is being made successfully. By the end of February, the number of engines used for daily operations should be more than 60. Also, the number of cancellations per day should be reduced. About 52 of the trains running in Sri Lanka operate daily. 17 are delayed by more than 10 minutes, and 10 are delayed by more than half an hour. If we want to improve the quality of this service, we need to make sure that the trains run on time. We have paid attention to that as well, he added.",

        "content": "The Sri Lanka Army has issued a statement clarifying the retention of passports belonging to Army personnel following various interpretations circulating regarding an administrative order issued by Army Headquarters on February 16. According to the statement, the measure has been implemented as an administrative procedure to enhance inter-departmental coordination within the Army. Under this directive, passports of personnel holding the rank of Major and below will be retained within their respective regiments. The statement further clarified; This measure has been implemented as an administrative procedure to enhance inter-administrative coordination within the Army. In accordance with this, directives have been issued to retain the passports of personnel holding the rank of Major and below within their respective regiments. The Army frequently deploys officers of these ranks for overseas training programs and peacekeeping missions. To ensure the smooth execution of administrative processes related to such deployments, it is essential to verify the validity, accuracy, and prompt retrieval of their passports. However, a significant number of these personnel are stationed in remote locations and typically keep their passports at home. As a result, obtaining them in a timely manner has been challenging, causing administrative delays for Army Headquarters. In light of these challenges, new directives have been introduced to enhance passport security and streamline administrative functions. Despite this measure, Army personnel may retrieve their passports for personal use at any time.",

        "content": "SJB Member of Parliament Dr. Harsha de Silva has questioned the ideological shift of the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) and the National Peoples Power (NPP), claiming that the parties are now proposing the same neoliberal economic reforms they previously opposed. They talked about a neoliberal program today. If they now say these reforms are good, what happened to the last 40 years of opposition? If they opposed these reforms for decades and now suddenly accept them, that means our 40 years were in vain. That is a crime, he stated. Dr. de Silva also pointed out that the recent budget does not reflect any significant ideological change from past economic policies. The last budget and this budget have no difference. If the country has been destroyed for 75 years, then change is necessary. If their ideology is different, it should be reflected, but that has not happened. I am not saying this is wrong; what I am saying is that this should have been understood decades ago, he remarked. Highlighting specific policy reversals, he questioned the JVPNPPs stance on state-owned enterprises and economic policies. If they now support establishing a holding company for state-owned enterprises, why did they oppose it earlier? If they now agree to fuel pricing formulas and electricity tariff hikes, why did they resist them before? MP Harsha de Silva further noted that the governments stance on reducing the number of public sector employees aligns with past economic recommendations, which they staunchly opposed. Now the President Anura Kumara says government employees should be reduced. If this was their fight all along, why didnt they acknowledge it before? Had they accepted these policies earlier, the country could have developed successfully. He concluded by viewing the policy shift as a validation of the social market economy system previously advocated by his party. Now we are happy that they have agreed to the social market economy system we presented. That is a victory, he said.",

South Korea has banned new downloads of Chinas DeepSeek artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot, according to the countrys personal data protection watchdog. The government agency said the AI model will become available again to South Korean users when improvements and remedies are made to ensure it complies with the countrys personal data protection laws. In the week after it made global headlines, DeepSeek became hugely popular in South Korea leaping to the top of app stores with over a million weekly users. But its rise in popularity also attracted scrutiny from countries around the world which have imposed restrictions on the app over privacy and national security concerns. Chinas DeepSeek rocked the technology industry, the markets and Americas confidence in its AI leadership, when it released its latest app at the end of last month. Its rapid rise as one of the worlds favourite AI chatbots sparked concerns in different jurisdictions. Aside from South Korea, Taiwan and Australia have also banned it from all government devices. The Australian government has insisted its ban is not due to the apps Chinese origins, but because of the unacceptable risk it says it poses to national security. Italys regulator, which briefly banned ChatGPT in 2023, has done the same with DeepSeek. The company has been asked to address concerns over its privacy policy before it becomes available again on app stores. Data protection authorities in France and Ireland have also posed questions to DeepSeek about how it handles citizens personal information - including whether it is stored on servers in China, as its privacy policy suggests. It also says that, like other generative AI tools, it may collect information such as email addresses and dates of birth, and use input prompts to improve their product. Meanwhile, lawmakers in the US have proposed a bill banning DeepSeek from federal devices, citing surveillance concerns. At the state-government level, Texas, Virginia and New York, have already introduced such rules for their employees. DeepSeeks large language model (LLM) has reasoning capabilities that are comparable to US models such as OpenAIs o1, but reportedly requires a fraction of the cost to train and run. That has raised questions about the billions of dollars being invested into AI infrastructure in the US and elsewhere. Source: BBC --Agencies",

He charged that various media outlets are spreading false information regarding the firefighting in the area around Ella Rock in the Ella tourist area, a world-famous tourist destination. According to the statement issued, the Deputy Minister of Tourism, Dr. Ruwan Ranasinghe, had an opportunity to address the media during the Clean Sri Lanka program held at the Badulla Central Bus Stand premises to clarify the facts about how the fire broke out and the steps taken by the government to contain it. The statement states that the defense sector is of the opinion that the previous attempts to extinguish the fire in the mountainous area by helicopters on various occasions were unsuccessful due to the high wind conditions in the area and it was decided to decide on the correct action to be taken to extinguish the fire that broke out at the meeting held on Feb. 14 between the Defense Secretary Sampath Thuyakontha and the Commanding Officer of the Diyatalawa Air Force Base. Accordingly, the fire extinguishing operation was launched. The statement further added, Therefore, we reject the unsuccessful attempts to inconvenience the people and the government who are contributing to the fire extinguishing operation by publishing various fake news. We request all the printelectronic media and social media to kindly publish only accurate and truthful information about the necessary fire extinguishing operations. On February 15, the Assistant Director of the Badulla District Disaster Management Center, A. L. M. Udaya Kumara said that the forest fire that broke out in the Ella Rock mountain range, a highly sensitive area within the Ravana Ella forest reserve, has now been brought under control.",

        "title": "European leaders gather for an emergency meeting over fear Trump has isolated age-old allies",
        "date": "February 17, 2025 09:56 pm",
        "content": "French President Emmanuel Macron had a phone call with Donald Trump just as he was about to greet key European Union nations and the United Kingdom at the Elysee Palace on Monday for an emergency meeting on how to react to the U.S. diplomatic blitz on Ukraine, which left the once rock-solid partner as a potential political liability. Macrons office would not disclose details about the discussion. Leaders of Germany, the United Kingdom, Italy, Poland, Spain, the Netherlands, Denmark and the European Union are holding talks on how to deal with Europes security quandary. NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte ia also attending. Last week, top U.S. officials from the Trump administration made their first visit to Europe, leaving the impression that Washington was ready to embrace the Kremlin while it cold-shouldered many of its age-old European allies. Despite belligerent warnings for months ahead of Donald Trumps reelection as U.S. president, EU leaders publicly ignored the ominous forebodings, hoping somehow that Trump would stand shoulder to shoulder with Europe while the continent would finally start to beef up its defenses and become less reliant on American firepower. But a flurry of speeches by Vice President JD Vance and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth last week questioned both Europes security commitments and its fundamental democratic principles. Macron said their stinging rebukes and threats of non-cooperation in the face of military danger felt like a shock to the system. The tipping point came when Trump decided to upend years of U.S. policy by holding talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin in hopes of ending the Russia-Ukraine war. Then, Trumps special envoy for Ukraine and Russia on Saturday all but ruled out the inclusion of other Europeans in any Ukraine peace talks. Europes existential moment German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock called the week an existential moment. Its a moment where Europe has to stand up. Thats where Macron hopes to step in with Mondays meeting. Ever since World War II, the United States and Western European nations have basically walked in lockstep as they confronted the Soviet Union during the Cold War, right up to the increasingly aggressive actions of current-day Russia close to its borders. Even if there had long been U.S. complaints about the reluctance of many European NATO nations to step up their defense efforts, they never boiled up to the political surface as they have over the past days. French officials said no firm announcements are expected to emerge beyond a show of unity from European leaders. More talks are expected at the broader EU level, they said. Sending troops after a peace deal? Ukraines President Volodimir Zelenskyy said negotiations are moving fast with Europe, in a virtual news conference Monday in Kyiv. Everyone told me that what happened (at the Munich Security Conference) accelerated everything. Zelenskyy said French President Emmanuel Macron had agreed to provide him with a briefing on the conclusions from the meeting in Paris. A strong U.S. link, though, will remain essential for the foreseeable future since it will take many years before European nations can ratchet up defense equipment production and integrate it into an effective force. That U.S. bond also applies to dealing with war in Ukraine, said U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer. U.S. support will remain critical and a U.S. security guarantee is essential for a lasting peace, because only the U.S. can deter Putin from attacking again, Starmer wrote in Mondays Daily Telegraph. While many EU nations are still mulling whether to contribute troops to a potential force in Ukraine after a peace deal, Starmer said that the U.K. was ready and willing to contribute to security guarantees to Ukraine by putting our own troops on the ground if necessary. I do not say that lightly. I feel very deeply the responsibility that comes with potentially putting British servicemen and women in harms way, he wrote. Macron last year refused to rule out sending Western troops into Ukraine if necessary. Boosting EU defense spending European nations are bent on boosting Ukraine where they can, and EU nations see eye to eye when it comes to upping defense spending. However, even if there is a general consensus to move beyond the goal of spending 2 of gross domestic product on defense, it is hardly clear how to get to 3. Some EU nations insist on an agreement on joint borrowing for massive defense projects, while others say the nations that lag behind on spending should first reach 2. That issue is also set to be discussed at the meeting. Polands Prime Minister Donald Tusk said he plans to urge other leaders to invest more in defense, ahead of his departure for the Paris meeting. Poland spends more than 4 of its GDP on defense, more than any other NATO member. If we want to decide about the future of Ukraine together with Ukraine, the United States, Russia, we must also show that we are capable of much more serious investment in our own defense, he said. However, he also said that he does not envision Poland sending its own troops to Ukraine. Some EU nations criticism But some of the EU nations balked at the thought of the restrictive Elysee meeting with only a few chosen leaders while others were left in the cold. For an uncomfortable number of decisions, the EU needs the backing of all 27 nations. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, a staunch ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, has already threatened to use his veto on a number of occasions. Slovenian President Nataša Pirc Musar said the selective list of invitees was proof that the EU member states are not treated equally. This is not Europe that commands respect abroad. This is not the Europe that would be a serious partner to the North American ally, she said. Source: AP --Agencies",

        "title": "Popes health a complex clinical situation, Vatican says",
        "date": "February 18, 2025 06:28 am",
        "content": "Pope Francis is being treated for a complex clinical situation and will remain in hospital for as long as necessary, the Vatican has said. The 88-year-old was admitted to Romes Gemelli hospital on Friday to undergo treatment and tests for bronchitis. On Monday, the Vatican said the pontiff has a polymicrobial infection of his respiratory tract, which has required a change in his treatment. A later update added that the Pope was proceeding with the prescribed treatment in a stable condition and did not have a fever. He also undertook some work and reading while in hospital on Monday. Pope Francis is touched by the numerous messages of affection and closeness that he has been receiving in recent hours, a statement added. He especially wants to extend his thanks to those who are hospitalised at this time, for the affection and love they have expressed through drawings and messages of good wishes; he prays for them and asks that they pray for him. Before his admission last week, the Pope had bronchitis symptoms for several days and had delegated officials to read prepared speeches at events. Vatican spokesman Matteo Bruni also told reporters on Monday that the pontiff was in good spirits. A short statement on his condition said: All tests carried out to date are indicative of a complex clinical picture that will require appropriate hospitalisation. The pontiffs weekly general audience, which is usually held each Wednesday, has been cancelled for this week, the statement added. Over the weekend, the Vatican said the Pope was stable and that hed been told to have complete rest to aid his recovery. On Friday and Saturday he held a video call with the Holy Family Parish in Gaza, led by Father Gabriel Romanelli. We heard his voice. It is true, he is more tired. He himself said, I have to take care of myself. But you could hear the clear voice, he listened to us well, Fr Romanelli told Vatican News. On Sunday, Fr Romanelli said he received only a text message from the Pope, thanking the parish for its well wishes. The Pope was unable to deliver his regular weekly prayer on Sunday in St Peters Square or lead a special mass for artists to mark the Catholic Churchs Jubilee Year. He also held meetings at his Vatican residence last week in an attempt to rest and recover. Members of the public outside St Peters Basilica have been sharing their well wishes for the Pope. Bernard, an Australian living in England and visiting Rome with his children, said we will say a prayer for the Pope. They always take up the job when theyre already elderly. So yes, its often that they suffer medical issues as a result, he told the BBC. Rome resident Armando called the Pope a great soul and an inspiration for us all. All the best, Pope. We are waiting for you back, he said. The Pope has been hospitalised several times during his 12 years as leader of the Roman Catholic Church and has suffered a number of health issues throughout his life, including having part of one of his lungs removed at age 21. In March 2023, he spent three nights in hospital with bronchitis and in June that year underwent a three-hour operation to repair an abdominal hernia. Another bout of illness also forced him to cancel his trip to the United Arab Emirates for the COP28 climate summit in 2023. In December last year he appeared with a large bruise on his chin when he led a ceremony in St Peters Basilica to install 21 new Catholic cardinals, which the Vatican said was the result of a minor fall. More recently, in January he fell and hurt his right arm and a sling was put on as a precaution. Source: BBC --Agencies",

        "date": "February 18, 2025 06:33 am",
        "content": "A Delta Airlines plane flipped upon arrival at Torontos Pearson Airport and ended up on its roof Monday, injuring 17 people. The airport confirmed on X that an incident occurred with the Delta flight from Minneapolis and that 76 passengers and four crew are accounted for. The accident happened at about 2:15 p.m. and flights at the airport, which handles more passengers than any other Canadian airport, were grounded for around two and half hours. Two runways will remain closed during the investigation. We are very grateful there was no loss of life and relatively minor injuries, Deborah Flint, CEO of Greater Toronto Airports Authority, told reporters. The number of people injured was down from early reports from paramedics that 19 were hurt. Video from the scene shows the Mitsubishi CRJ-900LR upside down on the snowy tarmac as emergency workers hose it down. The plane was somewhat obscured by snow from a winter storm that hit Toronto over the weekend. Ornge air ambulance said it was transporting one pediatric patient to Torontos SickKids hospital and two injured adults to other hospitals in the city. Emergency teams are responding, the airport said in a post on the social platform X. All passengers and crew are accounted for. Tower controllers were heard speaking with the crew of a medical helicopter that had just left Pearson and was returning to help with the crash. The plane came to a rest at the intersection of Runways 23 and 15L, the controller said. Thats not far from the start of the runway. Just so youre aware, theres people outside walking around the aircraft there, a tower controller said. Yeah, weve got it. The aircraft is upside down and burning, the medical helicopter pilot responded. It is too early to say what caused the plane to flip but weather may have played a factor. According to the Meteorological Service of Canada, the airport was experiencing blowing snow and winds of 32 mph (51 kph) gusting to 40 mph (65 kph). The temperature was about 16.5 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 8.6 degrees Celsius). Its very rare to see something like this, said John Cox, CEO of aviation safety consulting firm Safety Operating Systems in St. Petersburg, Florida. Weve seen a couple of cases of takeoffs where airplanes have ended up inverted, but its pretty rare. The audio recording from the tower at Toronto Pearson International Airport shows the flight was cleared to land at about 2:10 p.m. local time. The tower warns the pilots of a possible air flow bump in the glide path as the plane comes into land. It sounds to me like a controller trying to be helpful, meaning the wind is going to give you a bumpy ride coming down, that youre going to be up and down through the glide path, Cox said. Cox, who flew for U.S. Air for 25 years and has worked on NTSB investigations, said the CRJ-900 aircraft is a proven aircraft thats been in service for decades and does a good job of handling inclement weather. The weather conditions were windy. The wind was out of the west at 27 to 35 knots, which is about 38 miles an hour (61 kph). So it was windy. But the airplanes are designed and certified to handle that. The pilots are trained and experienced to handle that. Among the questions that need to be answered, Cox said, was why plane was missing a right wing. If one wing is missing, its going to have a tendency to roll over, he said. Those are going to be central questions as to what happened to the wing and the flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder. They will be found, if not today, tomorrow, and the Transportation Safety Board of Canada will read them out and they will have a very good understanding of what actually occurred here. The last major crash at Pearson was in Aug. 2, 2005, when an Airbus A340 landing from Paris skidded off the runway and burst into flames amid stormy weather. All 309 passengers and crew aboard Air France Flight 358 survived the crash. The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration said in a statement that the Transportation Safety Board of Canada would head up the investigation and provide any updates. The National Transportation Safety Board said it is leading a team of U.S. investigators to assist in the Canadian investigation. It is at least the fourth major aviation mishap in North America in the past month. A commercial jetliner and an Army helicopter collided near the nations capital on Jan. 29, killing 67 people. A medical transportation plane crashed in Philadelphia on Jan. 31, killing the six people on board and another person on the ground and 10 were killed in a plane crash in Alaska. Ontarios Premier Doug Ford said on X he is relieved there are no casualties after the incident at Toronto Pearson. Toronto is the capital of Ontario. Provincial officials are in contact with the airport and local authorities and will provide any help thats needed, Ford said. Delta CEO Ed Bastian said in a statement that the hearts of the entire global Delta family are with those affected by todays incident at Toronto-Pearson International Airport. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said he has been in touch with Delta about the crash. Endeavor Air, based in Minneapolis, is a subsidiary of Delta Air Lines and the worlds largest operator of CRJ-900 aircraft. The airline operates 130 regional jets on 700 daily flights to over 126 cities in the U.S., Canada and the Caribbean, according to the companys website. The CRJ-900, a popular regional jet, was developed by Canadian aerospace company Bombardier. Its in the same family of aircraft as the CRJ-700, the type of plane involved in the midair collision near Reagan National Airport on Jan. 29. A Delta Air Lines plane crash-landed at Toronto Pearson International Airport, flipped upside down, and caught fire. At least eight people were injured, including one in critical condition. pic.twitter.comKu1cR1sNVV Al Jazeera English (AJEnglish) February 17, 2025 Source: AP --Agencies",

Commenting on the International Monetary Fund (IMF) program and taxation, he stated, VAT is an indirect tax. We said it then, we say it today, and we will say it tomorrow  18 VAT is not bearable. However, there are limitations to reducing it. There is also an inherent limit to how much the economy can be constrained. It is currently stuck to a certain extent under the IMF program. We will work towards removing VAT in the future. However, we cannot overturn everything in the first budget at once. Our immediate goal is to remove VAT on essential items.

        "content": "The Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) states that it has implemented immediate and long-term measures to strengthen grid stability following the nationwide power failure on February 9, 2025. Issuing a statement clarifying the cause of the power failure and future actions to be taken as long-term grid stability solutions, the CEB acknowledged the inconvenience caused to the public during the nationwide power failure that occurred on February 9, 2025, at 11.13 a.m. and assured the public that immediate and long-term corrective actions are underway to prevent future occurrences. Cause of the Power Failure A system-wide failure was triggered by a disturbance at the 33kV Panadura Grid Substation, leading to a sudden voltage drop across the network. At the time of the incident, over 50 of national electricity demand was met by 800 MW of solar photovoltaic (PV) generation, with additional supply from Lakvijaya Power Plant at Norochcholai (470 MW) and hydropower plants (130 MW), according to the CEB. Due to the high penetration of non-synchronous solar PV generation, the grid had a low system inertia, making it vulnerable to faults. The disturbance resulted in an imbalance between generation and demand, leading to cascading disconnections and a total power failure, it added. Key Factors Contributing to the Outage: The High Solar PV Penetration  Low Inertia: A lack of synchronous generation made the grid more vulnerable to voltage and frequency disturbances. Solar PV Disconnection: A sharp voltage drop caused multiple solar PV systems to disconnect, worsening the imbalance and further destabilizing the grid. The Norochcholai Power Plant Tripping: This was an automatic protective response by this plant to the system instability, not due to an internal plant failure. The measure prevented catastrophic damage to the power plant and prolonged outages. Additionally, the outage was influenced by the Sunny Sunday effecta condition where low weekend demand combined with high generation from solar PV creates grid instability. With most industrial and commercial customers offline, the grid was operating with reduced demand and reduced inertia, making it more susceptible to sudden disturbances. Immediate Corrective Actions CEB has implemented urgent measures to stabilize the national grid and prevent similar failures, including: Maintaining more synchronous generators at minimum generation and operating selected gas turbines in synchronous condenser mode at key locations to enhance grid stability and voltage support. Curtailing ground-mounted solar PV generation (only when necessary) during low-demand periods to mitigate instability risks. Medium-Term Strategies To further strengthen grid reliability, CEB was in the process of implementing the following measures, which will be accelerated: Adjusting rooftop solar PV inverter settings to prevent unnecessary disconnections during minor disturbancesfaults, ensuring grid resilience. Introducing special industrial tariffs for weekends and holidays to encourage industries to shift operations to low-demand periods, thereby assisting grid stability. Promoting solar installations with appropriate BESS capacities over solar PV installations without BESS and to introduce a tariff for the Solar PV customers with Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) and the relevant hardware. Long-Term Grid Stability Solutions CEB is committed to long-term investments to modernize the national power grid to integrate more renewable energy while maintaining stability. These include: Deploying grid-forming inverters with BESS to provide synthetic inertia and frequency stabilization. Installing emergency backup generators at Norochcholai Power Plant to ensure rapid reconnection and continued operation of critical systems in case of future disconnections. Accelerating the Maha Oya Pumped Hydro Project (Water Battery)  a 600 MW storage facility that will enhance grid flexibility and energy security. Advancing Smart Grid investments to improve real-time monitoring and control of renewable energy integration. CEBs Commitment to a Reliable Power Supply The CEB acknowledged the inconvenience caused to the public asserting that it remains fully committed to ensuring a resilient, reliable, and future-ready electricity grid. As Sri Lanka continues to transition towards a renewable energy-driven power system, CEB is proactively implementing both immediate and long-term solutions to strengthen grid stability.",

        "date": "February 18, 2025 12:21 pm",
        "content": "Italian chemist Francesco Rivella, best known as the inventor of Nutella, died on Valentines Day, according to various news outlets. He was 97. Dubbed the father of Nutella by the Italian media, Rivella helped create the worlds most famous hazelnut spread. Rivella began working at Ferrero  an Italian chocolate and confectionary company  in 1952, a dozen years before Nutella was introduced to the world, news agency Jam Press reported. He was 25 and was fresh from earning his degree in bromatological chemistry in Turin. Rivella worked in Ferreros chemistry room, where some of the brands most iconic creations were born. He was part of the Ferrero team responsible for studying raw materials to develop new products by blending, refining and tasting ingredients in pursuit of the perfect flavors. Throughout his long career at Ferrero, Rivella eventually became a senior manager with the company, which was founded by namesake Pietro Ferrero in 1946. Rivella worked closely with Ferreros son, Michele Ferrero, who took over the family business, serving as his right-hand man, according to Jam Press. The first iteration of what would become Nutella was originally called Giandujot, derived from gianduja  a confection made with chocolate and hazelnuts  and sold in 1946. The sweet paste of the first recipe was shaped into a loaf that could be sliced and spread on bread, named after a local carnival character, according to Nutellas website. By 1951, the paste was transformed into a creamy new product that was easier to spread, Nutellas website said. It was called SuperCrema. It would take more than a decade before the recipe was improved  leading to the creation of the first-ever jar of hazelnut and cocoa cream in 1964, the website said. In his book Mondo Nutella (Nutella World), Italian journalist Gigi Padovani recalled that Rivella and Michele Ferrero traveled the world to buy sweets not to copy them, but to make them better. Nutella is made of seven ingredients, according to its website  sugar, palm oil, hazelnuts, milk, cocoa, lecithin and vanillin. World Nutella Day, established in 2007, was celebrated on Feb. 5. After retiring, Rivella dedicated himself to fruit farming and the traditional Italian sport of pallapugno, Jam Press reported. Rivella is survived by three sons, a daughter and seven grandchildren. Michele Ferrero died on Feb. 14, 2015  10 years to the day before Rivellas death. Rivellas funeral was scheduled for Monday in Alba, where he lived after his retirement. He will be laid to rest in Barbaresco, according to reports. Source: Fox News --Agencies",

The MP made this statement during the second reading debate on the 2025 Appropriation Bill in the Parliament today (18). The MP further commented: I had another big dream of buying a Japanese bike. Someone said a Vitz could be bought for Rs. 1.4 million. I looked up and saw that the Toyota Raize is Rs. 12 million, the Yaris is Rs. 18.5 million, and the Prius is Rs. 28.9 million. A big problem has been created here. Yesterday, the President said that the majority of the tax revenue is due to the import of motor vehicles. I looked into this. Taxes should increase by about 1.6 of the gross domestic product (GDP). About half of that comes from vehicle imports. So, vehicle imports are extremely risky because who will import vehicles at such skyrocketing prices. I dont believe there are people in Sri Lanka wealthy enough to afford importing such vehicles, he added.",

The IMF staff and the Sri Lankan authorities reached a staff-level agreement on the Third Review of Sri Lankas EFF program on November 23, 2024. Once approved by the IMFs Executive Board, Sri Lanka will have access to around USD 333 million in financing. The IMF had previously stated that the release of the fourth tranche of Sri Lankas EFF programme is pending its Executive Boards approval and that the approval is contingent upon implementation by the authorities of prior actions, including submission of the 2025 Budget that is consistent with parameters identified under the program. However, during IMFs weekly press briefing held on February 06, IMF Spokesperson Julie Kozack emphasized that Sri Lankas ambitious reform agenda is delivering commendable outcomes, noting that the economy expanded by 5.5 percent in the fourth quarter of 2024. Average headline and core inflation remain contained well below the target during the fourth quarter of 2024. And international reserves increased to 6.1 billion at the end of 2024, she added. Responding to a question raised by a journalist during the weekly press briefing, regarding Sri Lankas Budget 2025, the IMF Spokesperson said: With respect to the specific question on the budget, what I can share is that the staff-level agreement that I mentioned, which was reached in November, will be presented to the Executive Board or is subject to Executive Board approval, but its also contingent upon, among other things, implementation by the authorities of prior actions, including submission of the 2025 budget that is consistent with parameters identified under the program. Accordingly, the IMF Executive Board meeting for the third review of EFF program follows Sri Lankas President Anura Kumara Dissanayake presenting his maiden full Budget, which is the 79th Budget Speech of Independent Sri Lanka, to the Parliament on Monday (Feb. 17).",

        "title": "Deputy Minister offers clarification on public sector salary hike",
        "date": "February 18, 2025 02:58 pm",
        "content": "The Deputy Minister of Labour Mahinda Jayasinghe today provided a clarification with regard to the process of salary increments to the public sector employees scheduled to be implemented as per the 2025 Budget proposals. Speaking during the second reading debate of the 2025 Budget in the Parliament today (18), the Deputy Minister expressed that certain individuals are misleading the public regarding the increase in government employees salaries. Accordingly, Jayasinghe explained that the salaries of the employees in the lowest level of the public service, PL 1, will receive an increment of Rs. 5,975. While explaining the process of salary increments to Grama Niladharis and doctors, the Deputy Minister said that Rs. 7,500 from the gross salary increase will be deducted and 30 of the remaining amount will be added to the basic salary of all government employees from April 01. We have not hidden when the basic salary increases by Rs. 15,750. We have said it. Currently, two types of allowances are given to public servants. One is the Cost of Living allowance of Rs. 17,800 and two other allowances of Rs. 7,500 which were increased in the past - Rs. 5,000 and Rs. 2,500. Here, this Rs. 7,500 is included into that salary increase of Rs. 15,750. When the basic is increased by Rs. 15,750, there is Rs. 7,500 and the new part. Harsha de Silva mentioned only this PL 1 salary. He did not talk about other salaries. Therefore, Rs. 5,000 and Rs. 975 of the remaining Rs. 3,250 will increase this year. Then, the minimum salary of the PL 1 category in the public service will increase by Rs. 5,975. Also, the annual salary increment of everyone in the public service will increase by 80. The minimum annual salary increment of Rs. 250 will increase by 80 up to Rs. 450. Similarly, salaries in other categories will also increase. The current salary of the Grama Niladhari Service GN - 1 - Rs. 28,940 will become 56,630 within three years. Also, do not forget that the Cost of Living allowance of Rs. 17,500 will be added to the basic of Rs. 40,000 in the same way. Then the gross increase will be Rs. 21,690. When Rs. 17,500 is removed from there, the net increase will be Rs. 14,190. That means that the salary of a Grama Niladhari today will increase by Rs. 9,257. At the moment, the salary of a doctor (MO) joining the medical service is Rs. 54,290. It increases the basic to Rs. 91,750. Then, if his gross increase is Rs. 37,460 and Rs. 7,500 are subtracted, it will be 30 of Rs. 29,960. All government employees will receive 30 of the remaining 30 after deducting Rs. 7,500 from the gross increase from April 1 of this year. Then, the salary of a doctor will increase by Rs. 13,988. Now, the hourly rate is Rs. 687. With this new salary increase, the OT for a newly joining medical officer will be Rs. 764 per hour. These salary adjustments are expected to be implemented from April 1, 2025 benefiting all government employees with structured increments based on their respective salary scales. The Presidents remarks regarding the public sector salary increments during yesterdays Budget Speech is as follows; Public Service Salary Increase Given that nearly a decade has passed since the last basic salary revision, it is now time to revise the salary structure having evaluated all factors in a holistic manner. It is necessary to provide a decent living standard for public sector employees, enabling the Government to attract talent and skilled workers, whilst at the same time avoiding an excessive burden on the budget. Accordingly, we propose to increase the minimum monthly basic salary from Rs.24,250 to Rs.40,000 by Rs.15,750. The current ad-hoc interim allowance and special allowance will be integrated into the basic salary giving a net increase of Rs.8,250 in the minimum salary. The proposed minimum monthly basic salary increase of Rs. 15,750 will also be applicable to judicial services, public corporations, statutory boards, university staff, and officers of tri-forces on the same basis in line with the minimum basic salary increase for public sector employees. In addition to a minimum monthly basic salary increase of Rs.15,750, it is proposed to raise the value of the annual salary increment by 80 percent. Consequently, the minimum annual salary increment of Rs. 250 will be increased to Rs. 450. It is also proposed to adjust annual salary increments for all public sector employees to the same percentage. The total estimated cost of this salary increase is expected to be Rs.325 billion. Considering present fiscal constraints, it is proposed that this salary increase be implemented in phases. Of the total net salary increase, Rs.5,000 and 30 percent of the balance amount will be paid starting from April 2025, with the remaining 70 percent being paid in equal portions beginning in January 2026 and January 2027. Therefore, it is proposed that Rs.110 billion be allocated for the proposed salary increase in 2025. As part of this salary increase, it is proposed that the retirement benefits for officers retiring on or after 01.01. 2025be calculated based on the new salary structure, ensuring that they receive retirement benefits under the proposed 2025 salary scheme. Considering the increase in the minimum basic salary of state employees, the limit on distress loans for public servants which is currently set at Rs. 250,000 will also be increased to Rs. 400,000. Further details of the salary increase are given in the Technical Note in Annexure V.",

Parts of the vehicle were concealed in a coconut plantation land in Puttalam owned by the former MP and in another house near his residence. The chassis and body parts of the vehicle were found hidden in the nearby house, while several more vehicle parts, including the engine, were discovered in the aforementioned property. Further investigations revealed that the vehicle had been registered using the engine and chassis numbers of a vehicle already currently used by the Department of Agriculture. It was also revealed that the vehicle used by the former MP had these numbers engraved on it. Furthermore, it was revealed that the former MP Shantha Abeysekara and his son had allegedly disassembled and hidden the vehicle after police recently seized several illegally assembled vehicles. Police stated that although they attempted to record a statement from the former MP on February 5 regarding this matter, he could not be reached.",

        "date": "February 18, 2025 05:33 pm",
        "content": "A two-day workshop to train 150 selected members of the Tri Forces and the Sri Lanka Police as trainers to properly implement the Clean Sri Lanka program commenced today (February 18) at the Sri Lanka Light Infantry Regimental Center premises in Panagoda, the Ministry of Defence said. Defence Secretary Air Vice Marshal Sampath Thuyakontha (Retd) while delivering the welcome address welcomed all the participating officers to the program. While speaking, the Defence Secretary said, that the Clean Sri Lanka program, which aims to enhance the aspects of governance sustainability, social sustainability, environmental sustainability and economic sustainability to positively enhance the image of Sri Lanka by involving the local community, public and private sector institutions, the general public, media institutions, non-governmental organizations and international non-governmental organizations, is currently being successfully implemented island-wide. He further said that the new government led by President Anura Kumara Dissanayake aims to successfully implement the national policies to create a stable country by resolving the economic crisis that the country is facing, adhering to international policies, and laying the foundation for an economic and social system. He also said that it is the responsibility of all to contribute to achieving this, adhering to Sri Lankas development approach for a better future under the theme A Rich Country - A Beautiful Life, the statement added. To obtain the contribution of the entire community for the Clean Sri Lanka program for the common good of all Sri Lankans and to achieve proper development goals sustainably, this training is being implemented for selected trainers from the tri-forces and the police.

        "date": "February 18, 2025 06:03 pm",
        "content": "U.S. and Russian officials held more than four hours of talks in Riyadh on Tuesday, their first on ending the war in Ukraine, as Kyiv and its European allies watched anxiously from the sidelines and Moscow raised a major new demand. Interfax news agency quoted Russian negotiator Yuri Ushakov as saying the talks went well, and conditions were discussed for a meeting between presidents Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin. Ushakov said a summit was unlikely to take place next week. But the talks in the Saudi capital underscored the rapid pace of U.S. efforts to halt the conflict, less than a month after Trump took office and six days after he spoke by phone to Putin. Even while the meeting was under way, Russia signalled a hardening of its demands. Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova told reporters in Moscow it was not enough for NATO not to admit Ukraine as a member. She said the alliance must go further by disavowing a promise it made at a summit in Bucharest in 2008 that Kyiv would join at a future, unspecified, date. Otherwise, this problem will continue to poison the atmosphere on the European continent, she said. There was no immediate response from NATO members or the United States. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has consistently demanded NATO membership as the only way to guarantee Kyivs sovereignty and independence from its nuclear-armed neighbour. He and European leaders are worried that Trump could cut a hasty deal with Moscow that ignores their security interests, rewards Russia for its invasion and leaves Putin free to threaten Ukraine or other countries in the future. Critics say that Trumps team, by ruling out NATO membership for Ukraine and saying that Kyivs desire to win back all its lost territory is an illusion, has made major concessions in advance. U.S. officials say they are simply recognising reality. Ukraine says no peace deal can be made on its behalf. We, as a sovereign country, simply will not be able to accept any agreements without us, Zelenskiy said last week. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "date": "February 18, 2025 06:13 pm",
        "content": "The Ceylon Chamber of Commerce (CCC) has welcomed the bold proposals in the 2025 Budget, which it says align with its recommendations, Sri Lanka Economic Summit discussions, and Vision 2030 goals. The 2025 Budget focuses on stability, governance, public relief, tackling corruption, and driving inclusive growth, the Chamber said, adding that the Budget emphasises infrastructure expansion through Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) and digital economy initiatives, providing a strong foundation for transformation. The Chamber said it appreciates the Governments recognition of the need to reform the Customs Ordinance and the implementation of the National Single Window, both crucial for enhancing trade facilitation and improving the ease of doing business. We also acknowledge the planned implementation of the Economic Transformation Act with amendments and the introduction of legislation on Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs). Issuing a statement, the CCC said the timely execution of these reforms will create a more conducive environment for private sector investment in key sectors such as ports, tourism, and infrastructure, as highlighted in the budget speech. The Chamber commended the Government for maintaining policy consistency by retaining the existing tax framework and avoiding ad-hoc tax measures to match the expenditure proposals. It said that adhering to the Public Financial Management Act, which caps primary expenditure at 13 of GDP, is a positive step toward rebuilding investor confidence and strengthening Sri Lankas global credit standing. Ensuring tax stability during the year and simplifying compliance will be crucial for fostering a competitive business environment. The Chamber further said that the above-mentioned bold reforms require time-bound implementation to translate the Budgets vision into a reality that will be felt by the public. For example, projects like the National Single Window which has been a request from the private sector for over two decades require commitment by the Government on the implementation plan, it said. The Chamber also welcomed the plan to establish a holding company for SOEs, aligning with global best practices to improve governance, financial discipline, and efficiency. Its success will depend on clear timelines, independent oversight, and transparency. The focus on digitalisation and e-governance is also a positive step, with initiatives like the Unique Digital ID and the setup of an Apex Digital Economy Authority to reduce bureaucracy and enhance transparency, the statement said. The Ceylon Chamber of Commerces statement further reads: The transition from the current SVAT system to a risk-based refund system requires careful execution, including stress-tested pilot programmes to ensure a robust and efficient refund process. The changes to the minimum wage for private sector should be carried out in a consultative process and align with business sustainability and broader labour reforms that advocate for higher womens economic participation and flexible work. The budget prioritises investment-driven growth but needs stronger support for MSMEs, vital for jobs and resilience. While Rs. 254 billion is allocated for agriculture, a clear strategy for modernisation, value chains, and climate resilience, is crucial. Policies on sustainable farming, irrigation, and private-sector agro-processing, must be strengthened to counter climate change impacts. The Governments emphasis on investment-led growth, trade, digital transformation, and public sector reform, align with the Ceylon Chambers recommendations. While the 2025 budget effectively addresses fiscal consolidation, investment facilitation, and governance, its success depends on efficient time-bound implementation, policy stability, and stakeholder collaboration. The Chamber remains committed to working with the Government to refine and execute these policies, ensuring a resilient, inclusive, and globally competitive economy.",

        "date": "February 18, 2025 07:06 pm",
        "content": "A Chinese company has stopped exporting a piece of equipment used to process the electric vehicle battery metal lithium, in the clearest sign yet manufacturers are already implementing export controls proposed by Beijing. Jiangsu Jiuwu Hi-Tech told customers last month it would stop exporting a piece of filtration equipment known as a sorbent from February 1, according to a source with direct knowledge of the matter and documents seen by Reuters. China is the worlds largest producer of sorbents, used to extract lithium from brines or other solutions containing the battery metal, although its market size can be difficult to ascertain given Beijings reticence to share data, analysts say. The decision by Jiangsu shows Beijings threat, made public in January, to restrict the export of some battery and lithium technology, including sorbents, is changing behaviour even though the change is for now only a proposal. If approved, companies would need government licenses for overseas sales. An executive at another lithium extraction technology company, also speaking on condition of anonymity, said Jiangsu and Sunresin New Materials , another major sorbent producer, are negotiating with the government over the proposal. Representatives for Jiangsu and Sunresin did not respond to questions from Reuters. Sunresins chairman said a month ago the companys overseas expansion plans included transferring technology to customers. Beijing has not publicly discussed the proposal since it was released last month. Some in the industry consider it is already a deterrent to exporting listed items to unfriendly countries. A China-based international lawyer with clients in the clean energy industry said it was having a chilling effect. Officials with Chinas Ministry of Commerce have visited several companies to discuss the proposal and in one case, warned against proceeding with a 1 billion export deal that is being negotiated, the lawyer said, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue. Banks are also asking for extra approvals before signing off on export finance for items on the list, the person added. Chinas Ministry of Commerce did not respond to questions from Reuters. While it is unclear how restrictive the curbs would be if implemented, the proposal alone underscores Beijings willingness to use its dominance of the mining and processing of lithium and many other critical minerals as leverage in its escalating trade war with Washington. Chinas antimony export ban, announced last December, has already affected the Western auto market, Reuters has reported. Building an Alternative Supply Chain In the near term, any disruption of Chinese sorbent exports may affect plans by Western oil producers to extract lithium from their operations by limiting their technological options. Among them, Exxon Mobil has studied the potential use of Chinese processing equipment at its planned lithium operations, in the U.S. state of Arkansas, two sources familiar with the plans said. Exxon declined to comment. Koch Industries, the largest investor in Arkansas lithium developer Standard Lithium , agreed in 2023 to use sorbents from Chinas Xian Lanshen New Material Technology in its North American operations. A representative for Koch declined to comment. Several Western sorbent producers say they may be able to take market share, although none of them has the market experience of Chinese rivals and their equipment has yet to reach commercial production. We have to completely change the technologies and innovate in production and processing, and we have to do it without being beholden to China, which has a 20-year head start and controls the game, said Brian Menell, CEO of TechMet, which invests in Western mining companies and lithium equipment producers. Francis Wedin, chairman of Vulcan Energy Resources , which has developed its own sorbent technology that it plans to use in Germany, said would-be lithium producers were lining up for help. Over the past few weeks weve gotten inundated by companies wanting to approach us and buy our sorbent and license the technology, he said declining to name the companies but saying they included large lithium companies from North and South America.

        "date": "February 18, 2025 08:45 pm",
        "content": "Sri Lankas budgeted expenditure for 2025 will likely lead to a wider fiscal deficit and slower-than-expected fiscal consolidation, Moodys Ratings said on Tuesday, a day after the island nation unveiled its budget. Sri Lanka aims to transform its crisis-hit economy to prepare to resume debt repayments from 2028, President Anura Kumara Dissanayake said on Monday while announcing the budget which is seen as a key step towards returning the country to durable, long-term growth. The budget is mostly in line with targets set under a 2.9 billion International Monetary Fund (IMF) programme, including a key 2.3 primary account surplus goal. Expenditure is estimated at 21.8 of GDP as Sri Lanka directs more resources towards welfare and infrastructure development, analysts said, while revenue will be 15.1 of GDP. The budget has set a deficit target of 6.7 of GDP, which falls short of a 5.2 goal for 2025 preferred by the IMF. The budget underscores the challenge that Sri Lankas fiscal authorities will continue to face because of its still weak debt affordability, still narrow revenue base, and underlying social constraints, said Christian Fang, vice president - senior analyst at Moodys Ratings. Sri Lanka is aiming to grow 5 this year, Dissanayake told parliament, emphasising the need to support small businesses and key economic sectors such as tourism and tea to put the island nations economy on a sustainable recovery. Sri Lankas economy went into freefall three years ago after running precariously low on dollar reserves, leaving it unable to afford essentials such as fuel, medicine and cooking gas. Helped by the IMF bailout secured in March 2023, the islands economy has partly recovered and completed a 25 billion debt restructuring with bilateral creditors and bondholders last December. Sri Lanka is awaiting IMF approval for a fourth tranche of about 333 million. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "title": "Russia-US agree to work towards ending Ukraine war in landmark talks",
        "date": "February 18, 2025 09:21 pm",
        "content": "Russia and the U.S. agreed Tuesday to start working towards ending the war in Ukraine and improving their diplomatic and economic ties, the two countries top diplomats said after talks that reflected an extraordinary about-face in U.S. foreign policy under President Donald Trump. In an interview with The Associated Press, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said that the two sides agreed broadly to pursue three goals: to restore staffing at their respective embassies in Washington and Moscow, to create a high-level team to support Ukraine peace talks, and to explore closer relations and economic cooperation. He stressed, however, that the talks  which were attended by his Russian counterpart, Sergey Lavrov, and other senior Russian and U.S. officials  marked the beginning of a conversation, and more work needs to be done down the road. Lavrov echoed Rubios remarks and told reporters that the conversation was very useful. We not only listened, but also heard each other, he said. No Ukrainian officials were present at the meeting, which came as the beleaguered country is slowly but steadily losing ground against more numerous Russian troops in a grinding war that began nearly three years ago. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said his country wouldnt accept any outcome from the talks since Kyiv didnt take part  and postponed his own trip to the kingdom scheduled for Wednesday. European allies have also expressed concerns they are being sidelined. Improving Russian-US relations Ties between Russia and the U.S. have fallen to their lowest level in decades in recent years  a rift that has been widening ever since Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 and only worsened after Moscows full-scale invasion. The U.S., along with European nations, imposed a raft of sanctions on Russia in an effort to damage its economy. And embassies in Washington and Moscow have been hit hard by expulsions of large numbers of diplomats, as well as other restrictions. Rubio said Tuesday that ending the war in Ukraine could unlock the door for incredible opportunities that exist to partner with the Russians geopolitically on issues of common interest and frankly, economically on issues that hopefully will be good for the world and also improve our relations in the long term. His comments were further evidence of the remarkable U.S. reversal on Russia after years in which Trumps predecessor, Joe Biden, led international efforts to isolate Moscow. Tuesdays meeting was meant to pave the way for a summit between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin. After the talks wrapped, Putins foreign affairs advisor, Yuri Ushakov, told Russias Channel One that no date has been set yet for that summit but that it was unlikely to take place next week. Speaking to reporters after the meeting, Lavrov mentioned the same three goals as Rubio and said that Washington and Moscow agreed to appoint representatives to carry out regular consultations on Ukraine. I have reason to believe that the American side has started to better understand our position the Russian foreign minister said. U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff, who accompanied Rubio at the talks together with U.S. national security adviser Mike Waltz, said the meeting was positive, upbeat, constructive. Everybody was there to get to the right outcome. The meeting marked the most extensive contact between the two countries since Moscows Feb. 24, 2022, invasion. Lavrov and then-U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken talked briefly on the sidelines of a G-20 meeting in India nearly two years ago, but tensions remained high. Concerns from allies they are being sidelined The recent U.S. diplomatic blitz on the war has sent Ukraine and key allies scrambling to ensure a seat at the table amid concerns that Washington and Moscow could press ahead with a deal that wont be favorable to them. Kyivs absence at Tuesdays talks has rankled many Ukrainians, and France called an emergency meeting of European Union countries and the U.K. on Monday to discuss the war. Kyivs participation in such talks was a bedrock of U.S. policy under Biden. Rubio said Tuesday that ending the conflict would require concessions from all sides and that Europe would play a part  noting that they have also imposed sanctions on Russia. He said Washington is not going to predetermine would those concessions would be. U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said last week that NATO membership for Ukraine was unrealistic and suggested Kyiv should abandon hopes of winning all its territory back from Russia  two key items on Putins wish list. Waltz said the practical reality is that there is going to be some discussion of territory, and theres going to be a discussion of security guarantees. French President Emmanuel Macron on Tuesday said he spoke by phone to Trump and Zelenskyy following Mondays European meeting. We seek a strong and lasting peace in Ukraine, Macron wrote on social media platform X. To achieve this, Russia must end its aggression, and this must be accompanied by strong and credible security guarantees for the Ukrainians, he said and vowed to work on this together with all Europeans, Americans, and Ukrainians. Saudi Arabias role The meeting at the Diriyah Palace in the Saudi capital of Riyadh also highlights de facto leader Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salmans efforts to be a major diplomatic player, burnishing a reputation severely tarnished by the 2018 killing of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Saudi state media described the talks as happening at the princes direction. Like the neighboring United Arab Emirates, the prince has maintained close relations to Russia throughout its war on Ukraine, both through the OPEC oil cartel and diplomatically as well. Saudi Arabia has also helped in prisoner negotiations and hosted Zelenskyy for an Arab League summit in 2023. But Zelenskyy postponed his own trip to Saudi Arabia scheduled for this week, suggesting that he wanted to avoid his visit being linked to the talks since Ukrainian officials werent invited. He visit was rescheduled for March 10. War continues Meanwhile, Russia continued to pummel Ukraine with drones, according to Kyivs military. The Ukrainian air force said Russian troops launched a barrage of 176 drones at Ukraine overnight, most of which were destroyed or disabled by jamming. One Russian drone struck a residential building in Dolynska in the Kirovohrad region, wounding a mother and her two children and prompting an evacuation of 38 apartments, the regional administration reported. Four more residential buildings were damaged by drone debris in the Cherkasy region of Ukraine, according to local officials. Source: AP --Agencies",

        "date": "February 18, 2025 10:57 pm",
        "content": "Ravindu Sandeepa, the Police Constable (PC) who aided in the escape attempt of notorious drug trafficker Nadun Chinthaka Wickremeratne alias Harak Kata from CID custody and later fled the island, has been arrested in India along with four others. Wanted criminal figure and drug lord Harak Kata was arrested in Madagascar along with his infamous accomplice Salindu Malshika alias Kudu Salindu on March 01, 2023, in a joint operation by the INTERPOL and Malagasy law enforcement authorities and Customs officials. The duo was brought back to the island after Malagasy defence officials informed the Sri Lankan Foreign Ministry on March 08, 2023, of the arrest of eight suspects including the two Sri Lankan underworld figures. Harak Kata had been wanted by Sri Lanka Police for his involvement in multiple murders and robberies as well as transnational drug trafficking. While in custody, Harak Kata attempted a failed escape bid at the CID premises in September 2023, with the help of several police officers. One such Constable remained at large after fleeing the CID premises while Sri Lanka Police even offered a cash reward of Rs. 2.5 million for a tip-off about the said officer, Munipalage Ravindu Sandeepa Gunasekara. During the questioning, Harak Kata had allegedly requested to go to the washroom and was escorted out of the interrogation room with his accomplice  the police constable, and another sub-inspector attached to the Police Special Task Force (STF), assigned for the suspects protection. Although his handcuffs were removed at that point, the underworld kingpin had then walked out of the washroom acting as if he was still cuffed and had then attempted to snatch the STF officers firearm leading to a scuffle. A group of other CID officers were quick to arrive at the scene, upon hearing the commotion and managed to detain Harak Kata in their custody. Amidst the altercation, the aforementioned constable had managed to flee the CID premises and had continued to remain in hiding to date while certain reports had later claimed that he had fled the country. An INTERPOL Red Notice was reportedly requested seeking his arrest. On 18 September 2023, the mother and brother-in-law of the constable were arrested. The police also obtained a 90-day detention order to interrogate them. A police sergeant, a police constable, a former army sniper and several others are currently already in custody in connection with the incident.",

        "date": "February 19, 2025 06:38 am",
        "content": "Pope Francis has the onset of double pneumonia, the Vatican said on Tuesday, complicating treatment for the 88-year pontiff and indicating a further deterioration in his fragile health. Francis has been suffering from a respiratory infection for more than a week and was admitted to Romes Gemelli Hospital on February 14. The Vatican said in a statement that the pope had undergone a chest CAT scan on Tuesday afternoon which had revealed the onset of bilateral pneumonia that requires further pharmacological therapy. Bilateral pneumonia is a serious infection that can inflame and scar both lungs, and makes breathing more difficult. Laboratory tests, chest X-ray, and the clinical condition of the Holy Father continue to present a complex picture, the Vatican said. It reiterated that the pope was suffering from a polymicrobial infection, saying this required corticosteroid and antibiotic therapy, which was making treatment more challenging. Nevertheless, Pope Francis remains in good spirits, the Vatican statement added. The pope is especially prone to lung infections because as a young adult he developed pleurisy and had part of one lung removed. A Vatican official, who declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the issue, said earlier in the day that the pontiff had not been put on a ventilator and was breathing on his own. Ahead of the latest statement, the Vatican announced that all public engagements on the popes calendar had been cancelled through Sunday. The pope had been due to lead several events over the weekend for the 2025 Catholic Holy Year, which runs through to next January. The Vatican said on Monday that doctors had changed the popes drug therapy for the second time during his hospital stay to tackle a complex clinical situation. Doctors say a polymicrobial infection occurs when two or more micro-organisms are involved, and can be caused by bacteria, viruses, or fungi. The Vatican has said Francis will stay in hospital for as long as necessary. The pope has been plagued by ill health in recent years, including regular bouts of flu, sciatica nerve pain and an abdominal hernia that required surgery in 2023. The Vatican statement on Tuesday said he was grateful for all the support he has received in recent days. With a thankful heart, (he) asks for continued prayers on his behalf, it added.

The latest report of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) indicated that the Manufacturing PMI climbed to 59 in January while the Services PMI reached 58.5. The increase in the Manufacturing PMI was attributed to sub-indices contributing positively to this improvement. The outlook for manufacturing activities for the next three months remains positive, anticipating improved business conditions. Considering the services PMI, the expansion in Business Activities was driven by improvements observed across most of the sectors, according to the CBSL. New Businesses increased in January 2025, primarily due to expansions observed in the financial services, transportation and accommodation, food and beverage related activities, the CBSL highlighted.",

        "date": "February 19, 2025 08:54 am",
        "content": "Brazils former President Jair Bolsonaro was charged on Tuesday in connection with plotting a coup to overturn his 2022 election loss, further complicating the beleaguered far-right leaders already narrow hopes of a political comeback. Prosecutor General Paulo Gonet charged Bolsonaro and his running mate, General Walter Braga Netto, with leading a criminal organization that aimed to overthrow the countrys 40-year-old democracy. A total of 34 people were charged, including several military officials, such as Bolsonaros former national security adviser, retired General Augusto Heleno, and former Navy Commander Almir Garnier Santos, the office of the countrys top prosecutor said in a legal document. The responsibility for acts harmful to the democratic order falls upon a criminal organization led by Jair Messias Bolsonaro, based on an authoritarian project of power, the charge said. It is considered unlikely that Bolsonaro will be arrested before his trial unless Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes, who is overseeing the case, deems him a flight risk. The charges come just months after the federal police concluded a two-year investigation into Bolsonaros role in the election-denying movement that culminated in the riots by his supporters that swept the capital, Brasilia, in January 2023, a week after President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva took office. Prosecutors have said that the plot included plans to poison leftist standard-bearer and onetime union leader Lula, who narrowly defeated Bolsonaro in the late 2022 presidential election. They sought total control over the Three Powers Plaza; they outlined a central office that would serve the purpose of organizing the new order they intended to establish, the charging document said. One of the plans concluded with this expressive phrase: Lula does not climb the (presidential palace) ramp. JAIL TIME POSSIBLE Bolsonaro, a former army captain, has repeatedly denied breaking any laws, and calls allegations against him a witch hunt by his political opponents. A lawyer representing the former president did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Tuesdays indictment marks the first time the beleaguered right-wing populist has been charged with a crime, though he has faced several legal challenges to his conduct as president since he lost his bid for reelection. Two previous decisions by Brazils federal electoral court have already blocked him from running for president in 2026. Bolsonaros defense has two weeks to respond to the charges before Brazils Supreme Court, which is overseeing the case, decides whether it will accept the charges. If convicted on all charges, Bolsonaro could face 12 to over 40 years in jail. Many, including Bolsonaros own allies, believe his chances of being considered innocent by the court are slim. Theres a 99 chance that the Supreme Court will accept the charges, said Vera Chemim, constitutional lawyer in São Paulo. But to convict Bolsonaro, the Supreme Court will need robust evidence.

        "date": "February 19, 2025 09:33 am",
        "content": "When Delta Flight 4819 from Minneapolis to Toronto landed in a fiery crash that ripped off a wing and rolled the plane upside down, panicked onlookers feared the worst. But Michael McCormick saw decades of aircraft safety improvements in action. All 80 people on board survived Mondays crash at Toronto Pearson International Airport. That was absolutely phenomenal that you could see an aircraft on its back like that and have people walking away from it, said McCormick, an associate professor at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University. But my second thought was, well, thats the design. Thats engineering. Thats the years of civil aviation research  that has enabled something like that to happen. Fuel tanks are mainly stored in the wings Fiery aviation disasters of the past have taught experts that jet fuel should be stored primarily in the wings, not directly beneath the passengers. Back in the early days of aviation, that was where it was stored  in the belly of the aircraft, McCormick said. So when Deltas Bombardier CRJ900 crash-landed Monday, tipped over and skidded down the runway, its fuel-laden right wing broke off, leaving behind a massive inferno. The plane continued skidding and rolled over. In this incident, the wing breaking free kept the fire out of the passenger cabin, said Joe Jacobsen, an aerospace engineer who has worked for Boeing and the Federal Aviation Administration. Things can break  but if its within design requirements, then you have to see how it broke, and did it break according to design? Jacobsen said. The wing might have broken off due to a maintenance or design flaw, Jacobsen said. The investigation may examine those possibilities, he added. When a wing rips off entirely due to impact, ditching potentially explosive fuel is just one benefit, McCormick said. We want to be able to separate the fuel from the passenger compartment, and at the same time, we want to be able to ensure that the fuselage can come to rest in a stable position, McCormick said. The plane ended up in a stable position  albeit upside down. But everyone survived, thanks in part to brawny seats that can withstand extreme force. 16G seats are designed for safety  not necessarily comfort Most modern commercial aircraft are required to have whats known as 16G seats, meaning they can withstand 16 times the force of gravity, McCormick said. You dont want the seats to either fall apart or come loose in an aircraft accident  even if its upside down, he said. So its not specifically designed for comfort, its designed for durability in case of an accident, McCormick said. And you know that, if youve been in the coach for anything more than a few hours. The seats include a humble yet critical safety feature: life-saving seat belts. In this case, without the seat belts, passengers surely would have been thrown around and would have sustained a lot more injuries, said Hassan Shahidi, president and CEO of the Flight Safety Foundation. That was an important factor in this. And if this crash had occurred a few decades ago, the outcome might have been far more grim, CNN aviation analyst Peter Goelz said. Whats changed is that all commercial aircraft have seats that are locked in place on the tracks as part of the fuselage that can withstand up to 16 Gs of impact, said Goelz, a former managing director of the National Transportation Safety Board. That means that in a crash-landing like this, if youre strapped in correctly, youre going to survive the impact and have a chance to escape, he said. And when you combine that with advances in fire-retardant material  you really have a good chance to make it, if you follow directions. Nothing can replace skilled crew members While high-tech engineering likely helped save lives, You cannot give enough credit to the cabin crew for the safe evacuation of that aircraft, McCormick said. The two flight attendants on this flight had never landed a plane upside down, said Sara Nelson, international president of the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA. But the duo had trained for many scenarios, including evacuating passengers within 90 seconds. Despite dozens of passengers being strapped in their seats and dangling upside down like bats, the crew managed to evacuate the entire plane in less than 90 seconds. The flight attendants performed their jobs perfectly. They were heroic, Nelson said. And hopefully this will (make) the public be more aware and more grateful for the men and women who serve as flight attendants, McCormick said. They are responsible for much more than picking up trash and serving sodas. Theyre trained professionals responsible for the safety of the passengers. And they did a phenomenal job.

        "content": "President Anura Kumara Dissanayake highlighted that due to the mismanagement of public finances by previous administrations, the country had fallen into bankruptcy and is currently operating under a probationary period of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) program. Given this situation, he emphasized that the Budget 2025 has taken the initial steps towards building a strong and stable economy. The President made these remarks while participating in the Post-Budget forum 2025 organized by the University of Colombo Master of Business Administration (MBA) Alumni Association held today (19) at Cinnamon Life Hotel in Colombo, according to the Presidents Media Division (PMD). President Dissanayake stated that the government aims to utilize the three-year debt moratorium granted through debt restructuring effectively and implement proper economic management to regain debt repayment capacity by 2028. The President further noted that while many countries in the world have taken decades to recover after facing bankruptcy, Sri Lanka is expected to recover in a significantly shorter period, the statement said. The President also highlighted that this years budget proposes to increase government revenue to 15.1 of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and emphasized the governments commitment to prioritizing expenditures based on identified national priorities. The President emphasized that this years budget focuses on expanding the economy by driving economic activities to rural areas and integrating citizens as stakeholders in the economy. He expressed confidence that this approach would enhance the economic benefits available to the people. The government plans to reintegrate marginalized groups into the economy by establishing small economic units at the village level. As a result, the country aims to foster a surge in Small and Medium-scale Enterprises (SMEs), the President stated. Highlighting the governments commitment to supporting industries, the President noted that reducing production costs would ultimately provide relief to consumers. To uplift the nation from rural poverty, the highest budget allocation this year has been directed towards education. This investment aims to restructure both human and physical resources within the school system, transitioning from a linear education model to a more diversified, multi-directional approach. The budget also prioritizes public expenditure management. Given the high costs associated with delivering public services, the government intends to conduct a comprehensive review of state institution expenditures, the statement said. President Dissanayake stressed the importance of maintaining a corruption-free political authority and underscored that fostering a culture where bribery is rejected is a collective responsibility of the citizens. To establish an export-driven economy, the government plans to sign new trade agreements and anticipates higher export earnings this year, he said. Additionally, the President said the current administration is focused on developing a port-centric economy. The budget has placed special attention on establishing an efficient transshipment hub.

        "content": "The suspected gunman who shot and killed notorious drug trafficker and criminal gang leader Sanjeewa Kumara Samararathne, also known as Ganemulla Sanjeewa, inside the Hulftsdorp Court Complex this morning (19) has been arrested. He has been arrested in the Palaviya area in Puttalam by Police Special Task Force (STF) personnel while fleeing in a van. The arrested suspect has been identified as a 34-year-old. The infamous gang leader known as Ganemulla Sanjeewa was fatally shot this morning (19) in the No. 05 Magistrates Court within the Aluthkade Courts Complex (Hulftsdorp). Ganemulla Sanjeewa, who was remanded in custody at Boosa Prison, was escorted to court this morning (19) by prison officials for court proceedings. He was a suspect in 19 murder cases, according to police. Police have also discovered the revolver-type firearm which was used in the shooting inside the court complex. According to police, the suspect had entered the court premises disguised as an attorney while the firearm used in the shooting, a revolver, was smuggled into the court premises by concealing it inside a hollowed-out book, with the pages cut out in the shape of the gun. The suspect had managed to flee the scene following the shooting and investigations were launched to arrest the suspect. Sri Lanka Police later said that they have also identified a woman who aided and abetted the shooting. Speaking during a special press conference held in Colombo today, Police Media Spokesman SSP Buddhika Manathunga said that the suspected woman, who has also disguised as a lawyer and entered the court complex, has brought the gun which was used in the assassination, into the court. He confirmed that the firearm used in the shooting, a revolver, was smuggled into the court premises by the suspected woman by concealing it inside a hollowed-out book. Furthermore, the police spokesman clarified that several gates were available to access the court premises and that the assailant had fled the scene from a nearby gate while telling the other people that there is a shooting inside. He also explained that although the police immediately took action to close the gates and conducted a search covering the court premises, the suspect had already left the premises amidst the commotion that followed the situation, whereas the police were managing to ensure the security of the magistrate, prevent any escapes of other suspects within the court premises and several more procedures. However, the Police Spokesman had mentioned that further investigations are carried out by the Colombo Crimes Division (CCD) with the assistance of the Criminal Investigations Department (CID). The suspected shooter in the killing of Ganemulla Sanjeewa is also believed to be the same gunman responsible for the recent double murder at Watarappala, Dehiwala. Furthermore, it has been revealed that the woman who had brought the weapon used in the shooting is a suspected drug dealer from Negombo.

        "content": "U.S. President Donald Trump denounced Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy as a dictator without elections and said he better move fast to secure a peace or he would have no country left. Trump spoke hours after Zelenskiy hit back at his suggestion that Ukraine was responsible for Russias 2022 full-scale invasion, saying the U.S. president was trapped in a Russian disinformation bubble. A Dictator without Elections, Zelenskyy better move fast or he is not going to have a Country left, Trump wrote on his Truth Social media platform. Zelenskiy, who met Trumps Ukraine envoy Keith Kellogg in Kyiv on Wednesday, said he would like Trumps team to have more truth about Ukraine, a day after Trump said Ukraine should never have started the conflict with Russia. The Ukrainian leader said Trumps assertion that his approval rating was just 4 was Russian disinformation and that any attempt to replace him would fail. We have evidence that these figures are being discussed between America and Russia. That is, President Trump ... unfortunately lives in this disinformation space, Zelenskiy told Ukrainian TV. The latest poll from the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology, from early February, says 57 of Ukrainians trust Zelenskiy. Less than a month into his presidency, Trump has upended U.S. policy on Ukraine and Russia, ending Washingtons bid to isolate Russia over its invasion of Ukraine with a Trump-Putin phone call and talks between senior U.S. and Russian officials. Trump said he may meet Putin this month. The Kremlin said such a meeting could take longer to prepare but Russias sovereign wealth fund said it expected a number of U.S. companies to return to Russia as early as the second quarter.

        "title": "AAP Rocky found not guilty of firearm assault on LA street",
        "date": "February 20, 2025 07:51 am",
        "content": "Rapper AAP Rocky has been found not guilty of firing a gun at a former friend. A jury in Los Angeles acquitted the musician, whose legal name is Rakim Mayers, on two felony assault charges that carried up to 24 years in prison. Terell Ephron claimed the Grammy-nominated hip-hop star opened fire at him during an argument on a Hollywood street on 6 November 2021, grazing his knuckles with one of the shots. Mr Mayers, who is also a fashion mogul and the longtime partner of pop star Rihanna, denied the charges, arguing that the weapon was a prop gun and that his former friend, who calls himself AAP Relli, was only after money. As the first not-guilty verdict was read on Tuesday, the court rang with screams and clapping. Mr Mayers rushed towards his family and Rihanna, who were seated behind him. He dived over a wooden barrier to embrace them. Rihanna had been a repeated presence in court during the trial, and for Tuesdays verdict, brought along their two sons, two-year-old RZA and one-year-old Riot. Mr Mayers also hugged his lawyers and appeared to have tears in his eyes as the second not-guilty verdict was read. Thank God for saving my life, Mr Mayers said aloud. He thanked members of the 12-person jury. The rapper was arrested on the two felony assault charges after a heated argument with his former friend in the heart of Hollywood. Mr Mayers and Mr Ephron have known each other since high school in New York and were part of the AAP Mob hip-hop collective. Their friendship cooled as AAP Rockys career took off. Authorities said Mr Ephron met Mr Mayers on 6 November 2021, a day after the pair had a disagreement, outside a hotel about a block from the iconic Hollywood Walk of Fame. An altercation ensued. Mr Mayers was alleged to have pulled out a gun from his waistband and pointed it at Mr Ephron, telling him: Ill kill you right now. He looked me in my eyes and pointed the gun at me, Mr Ephron testified. Mr Ephron said he told the rapper to fire the weapon, but Mr Mayers started walking away. As he left, Mr Ephron followed, shouting at him. Prosecutors alleged that at this point, Mr Mayers once again pulled out the gun and fired multiple shots, with one bullet said to have grazed Mr Ephrons knuckles. Much of the trial hinged on whether the firearm in question was a harmless prop gun, as Mr Mayerss defence said, or a real weapon capable of causing harm, as Mr Ephron and prosecutors alleged. The weapon has not been recovered by authorities. Jurors were able to watch some footage of the altercation because parts were captured on surveillance video, including audio of gunfire, but no video evidence directly showed any shooting. Mr Ephron took two days before reporting the incident to authorities and brought shell casings he said he had retrieved from the scene. But police who responded to reports of a shooting in the area did not locate any shell casings. Mr Ephron, who said he returned with his girlfriend hours later, said he knew exactly where to look, but no surveillance footage corroborates his account. He was not admitted to hospital in Los Angeles and instead went for medical treatment after flying back to New York. Lawyers for Mr Mayers suggested that Mr Ephron had planted the shell casings to frame the rapper. The trial was marked by emotional and combative exchanges, particularly when Mr Ephron - the trials star witness - took the stand. At one point, Mr Ephron called Mr Tacopina - a defence attorney for Mr Mayers - annoying, which led to a reprimand from the judge. Another witness, AAP Twelvyy, was asked by prosecutors about a photograph showing Mr Mayerss bed with the letters AWGE emblazoned on the furniture. When asked what that stood for, Mr Mayers unexpectedly interrupted the proceedings and yelled, Dont say! Twelvyy ultimately refused to elaborate. Outbursts from defendants during trials are uncommon, especially in front of a jury. However, for a criminal suspect on trial to interject and instruct a witness not to answer a prosecutors question during cross-examination is something nearly unheard of in a court. The rapper is set to release his first solo album in nearly a decade and is scheduled to co-headline Los Angeles Rolling Loud festival in March 2025. Additionally, he stars alongside Denzel Washington in Spike Lees upcoming film Highest 2 Lowest, due to be released the coming months. Source: BBC --Agencies",

        "title": "Israel prepares to receive first dead hostages from Hamas",
        "date": "February 20, 2025 07:59 am",
        "content": "Hamas is to transfer to Israel the bodies of four hostages who have been held in Gaza since being taken alive in the groups attack on Israel on 7 October 2023. It has said they include a mother and two children from the Bibas family, whose unknown fate has gripped Israel since then. The youngest child, Kfir, was nine months old. Hamas says the fourth body is that of Oded Lifshitz, 84, a veteran peace activist. It will mark the first time the group will have handed over dead hostages since the ceasefire began last month. Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu said the heart of the entire nation is torn, adding that Israel was dealing with monsters. Six living hostages are due to be freed on Saturday. The news - though unconfirmed by the Israeli government - that Shiri Bibas, 33, and her sons (who would now be aged five and two) are dead triggered an outpouring of grief across the country. The government says it will only confirm the names of the dead after forensic examinations. In a statement, the Bibas family in Israel said it was in turmoil, adding that until we receive definitive confirmation, our journey is not over. It is unclear how the four bodies will be handed over, though the Red Cross, which has received the hostages so far released alive by Hamas, has called for a dignified handover. We must be clear: any degrading treatment during release operations is unacceptable, it said in a statement on Wednesday night. It follows widespread denunciation of the way in which Hamas has released hostages in recent weeks in staged events where they have been put on platforms in front on crowds of spectators before being handed over to the Red Cross representatives. It is not known how Shiri, Kfir and his brother Ariel - if confirmed - died. Hamas claimed in November 2023 that they had been killed in an Israeli air strike, without providing evidence. At the time, then-member of Israels war cabinet Benny Gantz said there was no confirmation of the claim. The family were taken along with the father, Yarden, from kibbutz Nir Oz when hundreds of Hamas gunmen burst through the border with Israel and attacked communities, security forces sites and a music festival. About 1,200 people - mostly civilians - were killed in the attack and 251 others taken back to Gaza as hostages. Israel launched a massive military campaign against Hamas in response, which has killed at least 48,297 Palestinians - mainly civilians - according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Yarden Bibas, 35, was released on 1 February along with two other hostages as part of an exchange for 183 Palestinian prisoners held by Israel. Oded Lifshitz, a retired journalist, was also taken from Nir Oz, along with this wife, Yocheved. The eighty-five year-old woman was freed by Hamas two weeks later. Oded Lifshitz had been held by the armed Palestinian group Islamic Jihad since 7 October 2023. The release of hostages bodies was agreed as part of the ceasefire deal which came into effect on 19 January. Israel has confirmed there will be eight. The two sides agreed to exchange 33 hostages for about 1,900 prisoners by the end of the first six weeks of the ceasefire. Talks on progressing to the next phase of the deal - under which the remaining living hostages would be released and the war would end permanently - were due to start earlier this month but have not yet begun. Twenty-four hostages and over 1,000 prisoners have so far been exchanged. Seventy hostages taken on 7 October are still being held in Gaza. Three other hostages, taken over a decade ago, are also being held. About half of all the hostages still in Gaza are believed to be alive. Source: BBC --Agencies",
