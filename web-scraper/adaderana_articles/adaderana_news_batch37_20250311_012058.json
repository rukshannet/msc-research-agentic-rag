        "title": "Sri Lanka to focus on energy, port projects with India during presidential visit",
        "date": "July 10, 2023 08:35 pm",
        "content": "Sri Lanka is likely to discuss energy, power and port projects during a presidential visit to New Delhi next week, the foreign minister said on Monday, as India tries to push forward stalled initiatives with its crisis-hit neighbour. Indias support was critical for Sri Lanka last year after it almost ran out of dollars and sank into a financial crisis that left it struggling to fund essential imports including fuel and medicine. India provided about 4 billion in rapid assistance between January and July in 2022, including credit lines, a currency-swap arrangement and deferred import payments, and sent a warship carrying essential drugs for the islands 22 million people. Sri Lanka will now focus on grid connectivity between the two countries, port development and renewable energy projects, largely in the northern part of the island, when President Ranil Wickremesinghe visits India from July 21 for two days, Foreign Minister Ali Sabry told reporters. Trincomalee energy-hub development, port development, possible refinery - basically we are discussing with India, Sabry said, referring to a strategically important natural harbour on Sri Lankas northeast shore. We are now continuously reviewing the progress and finding ways to fast track those, if possible. The two countries want to expand and develop the Trincomalee harbour into a major port. Regional rivals India and China have long battled for influence in Sri Lanka, which is strategically located in the Indian Ocean. Sabry said both China Harbour Corp and Sinopec (600028.SS) were keen to invest in Sri Lanka. Sinopec has already been short-listed for a 4 billion refinery near southern Sri Lankas Hambantota port. Sri Lanka is in talks with both countries to renegotiate its debt after defaulting last May. Sabry said the talks were making good progress. The idea is to conclude all these things by September and to officially come out of bankruptcy and start repayments, he said. Source - Reuters - Agencies",

        "content": "Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M K Stalin Monday wrote to Union External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar asking for his immediate intervention in getting 15 Tamil Nadu fishermen released from Sri Lanka. Through diplomatic channels we can reach an amicable resolution that respects the rights and livelihoods of our fishermen even when maintaining friendly bilateral relations between India and Sri Lanka, Chief Ministers wrote. Sunday, 15 fishermen along with their mechanised boats were arrested by the Sri Lankan Navy from Ramanathapuram in Tamil Nadu. The Chief Minister wrote that several hundred fishermen are dependent on fishing in deep seas for livelihood and the arrest of these fishermen and confiscating their equipment is creating major difficulties in the coastal areas of the state. Pertinently, fishermen associations have written letters to the Union government and state government asking to take steps for the release of mechanised fishing boats that are in the custody of the Sri Lankan Navy. The fishermen associations had in their earlier representations stated that the mechanised boats, which are in Sri Lankan custody, are the main bread winner for the fishermen in the coastal areas of the state.

        "title": "Turkey agrees to support Swedens bid to join NATO",
        "date": "July 11, 2023 08:55 am",
        "content": "Turkeys President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has agreed to support Swedens bid to join Nato, the military alliances chief Jens Stoltenberg says. He said the Turkish leader would forward Swedens bid to parliament in Ankara and ensure ratification. Meanwhile, Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson said: I am very happy, it is a good day for Sweden. Turkey had previously spent months blocking Swedens application, accusing it of hosting Kurdish militants. As one of Natos 31 members, Turkey has a veto over any new country joining the group. Reacting to the news, US President Joe Biden said he welcomed the commitment by President Erdogan to proceed with swift ratification. I stand ready to work with President Erdogan and Turkey on enhancing defence and deterrence in the Euro-Atlantic area. I look forward to welcoming Prime Minister Kristersson and Sweden as our 32nd Nato ally, a White House statement said. German Foreign Minister Annalen Baerbock tweeted: At 32, were all safer together. British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said Sweden joining would make us all safer. Mr Stoltenberg announced the agreement late on Monday following talks between the Turkish and Swedish leaders in the Lithuanian capital Vilnius. The Nato chief described it as a historic step, but stressed that a clear date could not be given for when Sweden would join the military alliance - as this relied on the Turkish parliament. Sweden and its eastern neighbour Finland - both nations with a long history of wartime neutrality - announced their intention to join Nato in May last year, several months after Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Finland formally joined in April. Mr Stoltenberg said Turkey and Sweden had addressed Turkeys legitimate security concerns and as a result Sweden had amended its constitution, changed its laws, expanded its counter-terrorism operation against the PKK (Kurdistan Workers Party) and resumed arms exports to Turkey. Turkey and Hungary are currently the only two Nato members yet to ratify Swedens membership application. Asked about opposition from Budapest, Mr Stoltenberg said that Hungary has made it clear that they will not be the last to ratify. I think that problem will be solved, he added. Earlier on Monday, President Erdogan had also appeared to link Turkish support for Swedens Nato bid to the EU re-opening frozen membership talks with Ankara. EU officials were quick to reject the demand, saying those were two separate issues. But in a statement after the deal was announced, Nato said Sweden would actively support efforts to reinvigorate Turkeys EU accession process and this would include modernisation of the EU-Türkiye customs union and visa liberalisation. Turkey first applied to join the EU way back in 1987, but its drift towards authoritarianism under President Erdogan brought the accession process to a halt. However since Russias invasion of Ukraine, Mr Erdogan has also played a unique role as a Nato leader with influence in Moscow. He helped broker last years Black Sea Grain Initiative, which enables Ukraine to export agricultural products from its ports. Turkey has helped the keep the deal alive, despite frequent Russian threats to withdraw. But Turkey has also angered the Kremlin by supplying armed drones to Ukraine. Russian officials were also furious at the weekend when Turkey, in a surprise move, allowed five former commanders of the Ukrainian garrison at Mariupol to fly back to Kyiv at the end of a visit by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Under the terms of a prisoner exchange last year, Russia expected the men to remain in Turkey until the end of the war. The two-day Nato summit kicks off in Vilnius on Tuesday and Ukraines membership bid will be high on the agenda. All alliance members agree that Ukraine cannot join the bloc during the war - amid fears this would lead to a direct conflict with a nuclear-armed Russia. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has himself said he does not expect membership until after the war - but he wants the summit to give a clear signal on Ukraines bid. Several Nato members in Eastern Europe are pressing for a fast-track membership for their neighbour but others, including the US and Germany, are seen as more hesitant. Russian President Vladimir Putins spokesman Dmitry Peskov on Monday warned that Ukraines membership of Nato would have negative consequences for the entire security architecture, which is half destroyed as it is in Europe. Ukrainian membership would represent an absolute danger, threat to our country, which will require of us a quite firm and clear reaction, Mr Peskov said. Source: BBC -Agencies",

        "date": "July 11, 2023 11:14 am",
        "content": "At least 300,000 Sri Lankans will leave their crisis-hit country for overseas jobs this year, with most of them choosing to work in Gulf countries, the Bureau of Foreign Employment said on Monday. More than 152,000 Sri Lankan workers have left the country since the beginning of the year, with over 112,000 of them going to the Gulf Cooperation Council region, opting first for Saudi Arabia, followed by Kuwait, Qatar, and the UAE. We expect the total departures for 2023 will reach 300,000, Gamini Senarath Yapa, deputy general manager of the Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment, told Arab News. The Middle East is their preferred destination due to traditional labor links and high salary packages, which make the region a major source of remittances. Currently more than 1 million Sri Lankan expats  or over half of the countrys overseas workforce  are employed in Gulf countries. Most of our agents are targeting the Middle Eastern market, Yapa said. There is easy access and also availability of jobs because they need people to develop their economy. The top destination is Saudi Arabia, which signed with Sri Lanka in February an agreement on skill verification, easing the recruitment process of skilled workers from the island nation. The deal covers 23 professions and Saudi employers recognize accreditations issued by Sri Lankas Tertiary and Vocational Education Commission. There are many sectors, Yapa said. If you are qualified, if you are a skilled worker, there are opportunities for you.  Expat workers are a main source of remittances for the country, which since last year has been in the grip of its worst financial crisis. This years inflows are expected to be higher than last year, when they reached 3.8 billion, as until May Sri Lankans have already sent home 2.3 billion. But it is not only dollars that make their stay abroad important. It is also the know-how they acquire. They are not only bringing the currency but experience as well, Yapa said. That definitely gives support to our economy as they are coming back with a lot of knowledge. Source - Arab News -Agencies",

        "date": "July 11, 2023 01:21 pm",
        "content": "Former President Maithripala Sirisena has paid Rs. 15 million, as part of Rs. 100 million compensation he was ordered to pay to the victims of the Easter Sunday terror attacks in 2019. Accordingly, ahead of the deadline on 12 July, Sirisena had paid Rs. 15 million as compensation on 28 June, on the orders of the Supreme Court, and filed a motion requesting that he be allowed to pay the remaining sum in 10 installments of Rs. 8.5 million from 30 June 2024 to 20 June 2033. In a motion filed through his lawyers, the former President explained that he receives a pension of Rs. 97,500 as the former President, alongside a sum of Rs. 54,285 for his services as a Member of Parliament, thus, he requested that he be granted the aforementioned time period to pay the remainder of the ordered sum of Rs. 100 million. On 12 January, the Supreme Court found that former President Sirisena, former Defence Secretary Hemasiri Fernando, former Inspector General of Police (IGP) Pujith Jayasundara, former National Intelligence Chief Sisira Mendis and former Chief of State Intelligence Service (SIS) Nilantha Jayawardena have violated the fundamental rights of the people by failing to take action to prevent the Easter Sunday bombings despite receiving sufficient intelligence information. Thus, in its verdict, the Supreme Court bench had ordered Sirisena to pay Rs. 100 million in compensation to the petitioners, while Pujith Jayasundara and Nilantha Jayawardena were each ordered to pay Rs. 75 million, Hemasiri Fernando was ordered to pay Rs. 50 million and Sisira Mendis was ordered to pay Rs. 10 million from their personal money. The relevant order was delivered by a seven-member Supreme Court Judge bench, with regard to 12 petitions filed by various parties stating that their fundamental rights were violated by negligence and failure to prevent the coordinated terrorist attacks on April 21, 2019. Accordingly, it has been reported that while the former President has paid a sum of Rs. 15 million thus far, Hemasiri Fernando, Pujith Jayasundara and Sisira Mendis have paid Rs. 1 million, Rs. 1,725,588 and Rs. 5 million thus far, respectively. Meanwhile, the Treasury has also paid a sum of Rs. 1 million as compensation on behalf of the government, sources confirmed.",

The Dutch government last week announced that it will return 478 objects of cultural significance to Indonesia and to Sri Lanka. It said the objects were wrongfully brought to the Netherlands during the colonial period, acquired under duress or by looting. Under the plan, Sri Lanka is to receive six artifacts, including the cannon and guns currently in the collection of the National Museum of World Cultures and the Rijksmuseum. The transfer of ownership to Sri Lanka will take place later this year. Foreign Minister Ali Sabry said Sri Lanka is very grateful for the items return. Discussions continued, he said, to identify the number of artifacts. We need to have the mechanism here to continue to preserve them, Sabry told reporters, adding that the government will look to the Cabinet for direction. The decision to return the artifacts came after a Dutch committee was set up in 2022 to assess requests for the restitution of artifacts in state museums. It is considering more restitution requests from Indonesia, Sri Lanka and Nigeria. One of the highlights of the looted objects being returned to Sri Lanka is the Cannon of Kandy, a ceremonial weapon made of bronze, silver and gold and inlaid with rubies. The barrel is decorated with a sun, a half-moon and a Sinhalese lion, the symbols of the King of Kandy. The cannon has been in the collection of the Rijksmuseum, the Netherlands national museum of art and history, since 1800. The museum said it was looted by Dutch East India Company troops during the siege and plunder of Kandy in 1765. The museums director, Taco Dibbits, called the decision to return the cannon and five other pieces a positive step in cooperation with Sri Lanka. Some Western nations are returning looted artifacts and other objects as part of a reckoning with their often brutal colonial histories. A Berlin museum announced in January it is ready to return hundreds of human skulls from the former German colony of East Africa. In 2021, France said it was returning statues, royal thrones and sacred altars taken from the West African nation of Benin. And last year, Belgium returned a gold-capped tooth belonging to the slain Congolese independence hero Patrice Lumumba. Source - The Associated Press -Agencies",

        "date": "July 11, 2023 03:18 pm",
        "content": "The beginning of July was the hottest week on record as a series of searing days saw global temperature records fall. The news comes after intensifying climate change and the early stages of the El Nino weather pattern drove the hottest June on record, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) said in a statement on Monday. The world just had the hottest week on record according to preliminary data, the UN agency said. The temperature data is the latest in a series of records halfway through a year that has already seen a drought in Spain and fierce heatwaves in China and the United States. Temperatures are breaking records both on land and in the oceans with potentially devastating impacts on ecosystems and the environment, the WMO said. We are in uncharted territory, and we can expect more records to fall as El Nino develops further and these impacts will extend into 2024, said Christopher Hewitt, WMO director of climate services. This is worrying news for the planet. Antarctics massive decrease Meanwhile, the WMO said Antarctic sea ice levels reached record lows last month as the planet warms. Sea ice levels were 17 percent below average and were the lowest ever seen since satellite observations began. Were used to seeing these big reductions in sea ice in the Arctic but not in the Antarctic. This is a massive decrease, Michael Sparrow, chief of the WMOs world climate research programme, told reporters in Geneva. Global sea surface temperatures were at record highs in May and June, according to the WMO, which warned that the warming of the worlds oceans was spreading fast beyond their surface. It is not only the surface temperature, but the whole ocean is becoming warmer and absorbing energy that will remain there for hundreds of years, the WMO said. Alarm bells are ringing especially loudly because of the unprecedented sea surface temperatures in the North Atlantic. Oceans rising The UN organisation said the El Nino weather pattern, which recently emerged, was expected to increase temperatures both on land and in the oceans, which could lead to more marine heatwaves and extreme temperatures. Weve seen unprecedented warmth in the worlds oceans recently, particularly the North Atlantic, Hewitt told Al Jazeera. Weve been observing the ocean rising, and as the world gets warmer and warmer, the sea will continue to rise and will do so for a very long time. So what is the cause of these worrying planetary trends? Underlying everything is global warming  the continuing rising trend of sea surface and land temperatures for the past several decades as human activities have increased greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere, said Annalisa Bracco, a professor of ocean and climate dynamics at the Georgia Institute of Technology. To lower the risk, the world needs to reduce baseline warming by limiting excess greenhouse gas emissions, like fossil fuels, and move to a carbon-neutral planet. People will have to adapt to a warming climate in which extreme events are more likely and learn how to mitigate their impact. Source - Al Jazeera - Agencies",

        "content": "The Threads app launched by Instagram as a rival to Twitter has seen more than 100 million users sign up in less than five days, data tracking websites said on Monday, smashing the record of artificial intelligence tool ChatGPT for the fastest-growing consumer app. While ChatGPT took two months to hit the 100-million-user mark and video-sharing app TikTok took nine months, Instagram itself took two and a half years to reach the same mark after its 2010 launch. Threads went live on Apple and Android app stores in 100 countries late on Wednesday, though it is not available in Europe due to legal issues the parent company Meta has had with the European Unions data privacy legislation. Twitter is thought to have around 200 million regular users but it has suffered repeated technical failures since Elon Musk bought the platform last year and sacked thousands of staff. Musk, who also serves as the boss of Tesla and SpaceX, has also alienated many users by introducing charges for previously free services and allowing banned right-wing accounts back on the platform. Several rivals have emerged, but most are niche platforms without the capacity to grow at the necessary scale to dethrone Twitter. Threads is finding it easier because it is linked to Instagram, which has more than one billion regular users. Online data service Quiver Quantitative reported that the app passed 100 million users at 07:00 GMT on Monday. Other websites using a count of the badges received by Instagram users who have downloaded Threads reckoned the mark had been passed earlier. Musk has threatened to sue Meta for stealing trade secrets and intellectual property, claims denied by the company, which also owns Facebook and WhatsApp. Musk is locked in a rivalry with Meta chief Mark Zuckerberg, with the two men calling each other out for a cage fight recently.

        "date": "July 11, 2023 03:48 pm",
        "content": "Nepals top court has ordered the legal registration of same-sex marriages, a first step towards marriage equality for LGBTQ people in conservative South Asia. Supreme Court judge Til Prasad Shrestha ruled marriages of same-sex and non-traditional couples must be registered as temporary until lawmakers come up with a new legal framework to uphold such unions permanently. In an interim ruling on 28 June, the judge ordered Nepals government to set up a separate register of marriages for same-sex couples, who lawyers say will have the same rights as heterosexual partners. The court also asked opponents of its landmark order to file their objections within two weeks. The ruling makes Nepal the first country to recognise same-sex marriages in South Asia, where Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and the Maldives have all opposed same-sex civil unions. In the rest of Asia, only Taiwan has legalised same-sex marriage. Gradual acceptance The ruling followed a petition submitted by LGBTQ activists last month to enforce existing rulings, dating back to 2007, that instructed the government to amend Nepalese legislation to recognise same-sex marriage for the sake of equal rights. Successive governments have so far failed to change the law. One of the petitioners, Pinky Gurung, a trans woman who heads Nepals Blue Diamond Society gay rights group, called the latest verdict historic. I think it shows that there are people accepting us gradually, she said. A 2011 census estimated that 1,500 people identified as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, intersex or other diverse sexual or gender identities in Nepal, but activists have claimed the queer community actually consists of 2.5 million Nepalese in the country of 30 million. Maya Gurung, a trans woman who married her partner Surendra Pandey six years ago in a Hindu ceremony that was not officially certified by authorities, said the legal battle wasnt over. Now we can finally feel our marriage will be legally secure, the activist said, adding that she would now seek privileges granted to all married couples. Resistance Western diplomats also hailed the ruling, which came during the global Pride month that celebrates LGBTQ people and their battle to overcome prejudice. As we conclude Pride month, we are reminded that the freedom to marry means very little without the freedom to marry the person you love, said US ambassador Dean Thompson. Nepal continues to demonstrate regional leadership in promoting the rights of LBGTIQA communities, said Australian ambassador Felicity Volk in a separate tweet. But the verdict also angered conservative Nepalese politicians. Same-sex marriage is against natural law, social norms and culture, tweeted Kamal Thapa, a former deputy prime minister and an influential politician in overwhelmingly Hindu Nepal. If same-sex marriage is legalised it will lead to family confusion and social distortion, he claimed. Sujan Panta, a lawyer who advocates for LGBTQ rights, warned that many people in positions of power held similar beliefs. Majority of them still find same-sex marriage to be unnatural, but with this court order, Nepal took its first step toward legalising same-sex marriage, he said. Winds of change In May, the supreme court ruled in favour of a same-sex couple who married legally in Germany but struggled to get their union recognised in Nepal. Judges called it a constitutional breach and ordered the government to act. Nepal has tried to stamp out social discrimination ever since a decade-long Maoist rebellion ended in 2006 and the 239-year-old Hindu monarchy was dismantled two years later. Citizens who identify neither as male or female are permitted to use a third gender on their passports and other official documents, in line with guidelines against discrimination spelled out in Nepals new constitution approved in 2015. More and more public parades and unofficial weddings are being held in Nepal, though LGBTQ people report that discrimination and harassment, including violence, remains commonplace.

Hasaranga beat out strong opposition from Australia batter Travis Head and Zimbabwe opener Sean Williams for the coveted award on the back of his superb performances for the island nation at the ICC Mens Cricket World Cup Qualifier. I am extremely happy with this award, and it comes at an important moment for Sri Lanka Cricket, after we made it to the Cricket World Cup in India. I am privileged and honoured to have been chosen as the ICC Mens Player of the Month, said Hasaranga. The all-rounder collected 26 wickets at an average of 10 during the month, with the majority of those scalps helping Sri Lanka qualify for the 50-over World Cup at the end of the year. Hasaranga was the leading wicket-taker at the Qualifier event, with the 25-year-old also becoming just the second player in the history of ODI cricket to claim three consecutive five-wicket hauls. Pakistan great Waqar Younis managed the feat way back in 1990 and Hasaranga matched the exploits of the dynamic quick by following up the impressive figures of 624 against the UAE with a pair of five-wicket hauls against Oman and Ireland. If Hasarangas efforts with the ball werent enough, the right-hander also managed to score 91 runs with the bat during the month of June to show his versatility in all facets of the game.

Addressing an event in Colombo, the prime minister urged all relevant institutions and departments to take effective steps to this end. These remarks were made during the Symposium of National Languages Equality Advancement Project (NLEAP) on Monday (July 10). Speaking further, Gunawardena said the cohesion of any nation with different communities depends largely on the ability to communicate with each other. Language is an inalienable right of the people and communication rights involve freedom of opinion and expression, participation in ones own culture, linguistic rights, rights to education, privacy and assembly, he added. If I may recap, Im in Galle Face Hotel today, and one year ago just outside this place at Galle Face Greens, there was anarchy. Let me recall, under President Ranil Wickremesinghe, we have been able to restore law and order in the country with the support of the people. And also restore economic stability, the prime minister opined. Gunawardena also expressed gratitude to the Canadian government for the financial support extended to the NLEAP Project and thanked High Commissioner Eric Walsh for his support to extend the project to help Sri Lanka to achieve its objective of equal advancement in national language usage. He said the objective of the Official Languages Policy of Sri Lanka is to enhance acceptance by Sri Lankan women and men of the cultural diversity in the country. Overcoming communication barriers also help for speedy economic development and ensuring uniformity in development. That in turn helps to reduce poverty and improve economic and social equality of Sinhala and Tamil-speaking women and men throughout Sri Lanka, he said. Director of National Languages Equality Advancement Project, Michael Emblem said the NLEAP project has served as a forum for academics, students and professionals to focus on specific challenges relating to the multilingual nature of Sri Lanka and gender-based barriers and to find solutions to them.

Deadpool MovieTwitter Ryan Reynolds Wade Wilson and Hugh Jackmans Wolverine together again in Deadpool 3 Dont blink, reads the caption on both actors social media posts. Its been a long time coming for Jackman. The actors appeared as Wolverine several times in previous X-Men movies, but he never actually wore a costume that evoked the animated character. There was a joke about the costume in 2000s X-Men, in which the actors all wore black jumpsuits. (You actually go outside in these things? What would you prefer? Yellow spandex?)

        "content": "Cabinet Spokesman Minister Bandula Gunawardena has explained that the decision to remove the Crudia zeylanica tree, located in the area of Daraluwa in Gampaha, was a policy decision made by the Government. Speaking at a cabinet briefing on Tuesday morning (11 July), Gunawardena explained that the removal of the tree in question was approved by the Cabinet of Ministers, after he, in his capacity as the Minister of Transport, made a request in this regard. He further explained that the uprooting of the endemic tree in order to continue construction of the Central Expressway was not, in fact, as harmful as certain parties portrayed it to be. I called for an inspection in this regard, and a report was subsequently compiled. There are 15 such trees which are over 40 years old, and there are 25 trees with a height between 12ft  15 ft., he said, adding that they have also taken the necessary measures to plant another 200 Crudia zeylanica trees on behalf of the one that they intend on uprooting. Gunawardena further highlighted that had the tree been uprooted prior to the COVID-19 crisis, when the matter was initially brought up, it would have cost Rs. 10 million. However, as a result of the uproar created by several parties for both political and other reasons, the matter was temporarily halted, and as a result, will now cost Rs. 30 million. Many parties including Gampaha District Forest Officer Dewani Jayathilaka, environmentalists, and Buddhist clergy had come forward to protect the tree, which is listed in the Red Data Book as an endangered species. We could have saved millions for the people of this country, but unfortunately, this is not the case, he said. Speaking on the agreement reached in 2021 to carry out the development work on the Central Expressway without removing the plant from the site, the Cabinet Spokesman explained that doing so would have caused the government to incur a loss of Rs. 15 million. Thus, he explained that while it has been proven that the Crudia zeylanica tree could, in fact, be planted again, the Cabinet of Ministers too, unanimously decided that there was no requirement to preserve the plant in question, at such a high cost.",

        "title": "Thailand prime minister retires from politics, nine years after his coup",
        "date": "July 11, 2023 08:58 pm",
        "content": "Thailands Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, who served almost nine years in office after seizing power in a 2014 military coup, said Tuesday that he is leaving politics. His announcement came after the political party for which he served as a prime minister candidate this year finished fifth in Mays general election, capturing just 36 seats in the 500-member House of Representatives. Prayuth, 69, a former army commander, made the announcement on the Facebook page of Ruam Thai Sang Chart, or the United Thai Nation Party. He had been their nominee to return as prime minister. I would like to announce my retirement from politics by resigning as a member of United Thai Nation, Prayuth wrote. Id like to ask the party leader, executives and members to continue their political activities with a strong ideology of protecting the institutions, the nation, the religion and the monarchy, and take care of the Thai people. Parliament on Thursday is due to select a new prime minister. The nominee from the top-running, progressive Move Forward Party who has assembled a majority coalition of eight parties with 312 seats in the Lower House, must win a majority vote of at least 376 of the combined vote of the House and the non-elected Senate, which has 250 members. Because of political differences with the conservative Senate, it is uncertain that the partys leader, Pita Limjaroenrat, can get approved. After serving as prime minister in the unelected military government that came to power in the 2014 coup, Prayuth was returned to the job after the 2019 election as a candidate of the army-backed Palang Pracharath Party. Prime ministers do not need to be Members of Parliament, and Prayuth didnt contest the polls in 2019 or this year. Had Prayuth been returned to office this year, he would only have been able to serve two more years under constitutional term limits. He was already one of Thailands longest-serving prime ministers. Prayuth did not specify a reason for leaving politics but listed what he considered his accomplishments in office and said: In these past nine years, I as prime minister have worked with my full determination and strength to protect the nation, the religion and the monarchy, and for the best interest of the beloved people.

        "content": "Sri Lankan President Ranil Wickremesinghes upcoming visit to New Delhi is expected to be a point of positive transformation in the relations between the two countries, Indian Foreign Secretary Vinay Kwatra said on Tuesday (July 11). His remarks came after the bilateral talks held with his Sri Lankan counterpart Aruni Wijewardane, Foreign Minister Ali Sabry and President Ranil Wickremesinghe. The Indian foreign secretary is in Colombo for a two-day official visit aimed at laying the groundwork for Wickremesinghes upcoming trip to New Delhi on July 21. This will be the presidents first official visit to India after taking office last year. Kwatra told the media that his discussions with the Sri Lankan leadership and with the Foreign Ministry were essentially focused on trying to ensure that the upcoming visit of the Sri Lankan president would be a point of positive transformation in the bilateral relations. The two sides have also discussed the key areas of partnership that India and Sri Lanka could progress ahead of the visit. According to the Indian foreign secretary, the focus of the discussions also fell on the strength of the ties between the two countries, different elements of cooperation in the relationship, and the entire matrix of economic partnership that India and Sri Lanka enjoy. Kwatra called the Sri Lankan president a very strong supporter of Indias ties with the island nation. We have worked and cooperated very well in the last 14-16 months of various challenges that Sri Lanka went through and I can assure that a very warm welcome awaits him in India. He said India eagerly looks forward to the Sri Lankan presidents visit to New Deli and make it a success.",

        "date": "July 11, 2023 11:31 pm",
        "content": "The health of a 30-year-old male Thai elephant Sak Surin (also known as Muthu Raja) appears promising despite a recent diagnosis of five separate tumours. The Thai Elephant Conservation Centre based in Lampang noted Sak Surins surprisingly resilient recovery. After spending 22 years on non-native grounds in Sri Lanka, Sak Surin was returned home and admitted to the Centres Elephant Hospital for care on July 2. The rehabilitation centre has since been running a series of health and behavioural assessments on the towering beast, finding overall encouraging signs of improvement. Sak Surins dietary regime rotates mostly around veggie-friendly options such as fresh cuts of grass and succulent fruit, consuming between 120 and 200 kilograms daily. Despite his ailments, Sak Surin has shown promising signs of adaptation. His sleep pattern remains consistent with 1-3 hours of sleep occurring twice each night. Acclimatisation with his new human caregivers (or mahouts) seems to be progressing well, as Sak Surin increasingly allows them close proximity, returning their familiar calls with slight nods of approval. However, not all findings have been as comforting. His physical examinations yield significant concerns with the presence of five tumours, each about 10 centimetres in radius located on his thighs. Furthermore, a small lump is noticeable on the right cornea and his front left leg presents some mobility issues. In an effort to diagnose these issues, on July 2, Sak Surin underwent a procedure that included taking samples from his mouth, trunk tip, manure, and blood. The specimens were then sent to the Department of Livestocks Veterinary Research and Development Centre for analysis. The lab results looked promising, with no signs of parasites such as Trypanosoma Evans in Sak Surins blood or manure samples. Importantly, the animal tested negative for harmful disease carriers including tuberculosis genes, herpes viruses, antibodies to leptospira, non-structural protein from foot and mouth disease, or B. abortus antibodies. A quarantine period of at least 30 days is projected for Sak Surin, during which rigorous health checks will be conducted on days 15 and 30, reported Bangkok Post. -Agencies",

        "content": "Six people have died in a helicopter crash in Nepal, a spokesperson for Kathmandus Tribhuvan International Airport said Tuesday. The Manang Air helicopter was carrying five Mexican passengers and a Nepali pilot, Teknath Sitoula told CNN. Reuters reported that Manang Air caters to tourists wanting a view of Nepals peaks, including Mount Everest, the worlds tallest mountain. It set off from Solukhumbu district, where Everest is situated, at 10:05 a.m. local time (12:20 a.m. ET) on Tuesday, heading for the capital, Kathmandu, according to a statement issued by the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal. The helicopter lost contact less than 10 minutes later, at 10:13 a.m., and was later found crashed in Solukhumbus rural municipality of Likhupike, according to the authority. It added that locals and police who reached the crash site found the bodies of all on board All six bodies have been located. We are now starting the process to take them to Kathmandu. It will take some time because it means traveling by road from the crash site and then flying to Kathmandu, Sitoula told CNN. He added that the cause of the crash has not yet been determined. Nepals inclement weather, low visibility and mountainous topography all contribute to its reputation as notoriously dangerous for aviation. In January, at least 68 people were killed when an aircraft went down near the city of Pokhara in central Nepal. This was the Himalayan nations deadliest plane crash in more than 30 years.

        "date": "July 12, 2023 08:33 am",
        "content": "The Sri Lanka Navy on Tuesday (July 11) rendered assistance to bring ashore a fisherman who had sustained burn injuries in an accident while aboard a local multiday fishing trawler. The fisherman has experienced this ill-fated incident while at sea approximately 431 nautical miles (about 798km) off the coast of Galle, southwestern of the island, the Navy said. The multiday fishing trawler named Sachintha Putha had set sail from the Negombo harbour for fishing on June 22, with 05 crew members. According to the Navy, the fishing trawler had collided with a foreign vessel on the high seas southwest of Sri Lanka. A fisherman who was aboard the local boat had suffered burn injuries after the foreign vessel attacked them. Amidst this, the Department of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources alerted the Maritime Rescue Coordination Centre (MRCC) Colombo, located at the Navy Headquarters, of the ill-fated situation. Swinging into action on the directives of navy commander Vice Admiral Priyantha Perera, the naval personnel made prompt arrangements to bring the wounded fisherman ashore. Accordingly, MRCC Colombo informed the Bulk Carrier SPAR MIRA sailing in the same sea area to get the wounded fisherman aboard. The Bulk Carrier responded to the MRCC Colombos information and retrieved the injured fisherman, bringing him on board. Instead of continuing its original course towards Singapore, the ship altered its route and sailed approximately 400 nautical miles to the southern sea area of Sri Lanka by this evening. Meanwhile, a Fast Attack Craft attached to the Southern Naval Command transferred the fishermen brought by SPAR MIRA and took the injured person to the Galle Harbour while administering first aid. He was then rushed to the Karapitiya Teaching Hospital, Galle for further medical attention.",

In a press release issued in light of the recent trend of pressure being exerted over the judiciary, the BASL raised deep concerns about the MPs exploiting parliamentary privileges by making statements in the House for matters which are sub judice (being considered by a court or judge). Referring to a recent statement made by MP Sarath Weerasekara in parliament on July 07, the BASL deemed it unfounded and a brazen attack on the judiciary and the social fabric of the country. Accordingly, the association went on to emphasize the importance of allowing the judiciary to operate independently, free from external pressures, threats or any interference, for a vibrant democracy to exist. Noting that any interference in the judicial process sets a dangerous precedent, which must be strongly condemned, the BASL urged the government and the opposition to respect and observe the independence of the judiciary.",

        "title": "President deplores burning of Quran in Sweden, urges West to respect Global Souths values",
        "date": "July 12, 2023 09:58 am",
        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe has deplored the burning of the Holy Quran outside a mosque in Sweden amidst Eid al-Adha celebrations two weeks ago, deeming it a violation of the freedom of worship. On June 28, an Iraqi named Salwan Momika, who is said to be living in Sweden, set fire to a copy of Islams sacred text outside the central mosque in Stockholm, sparking anger among Muslims across the world. Swedish police had initially granted permission for the protest to take place, but the demonstrator was later charged with agitation against an ethnic or national group. Speaking in this regard at the inauguration of a new court complex, the Sri Lankan Head of State urged the Western nations to respect the value system of the Global South  the countries around the world that are traditionally described as developing, less developed, or underdeveloped, He also called on the leaders of Western nations to refrain from allowing disturbances under the pretext of freedom of expression. The construction of the said court complex began on September 10, 2018, following a Cabinet decision made by President Ranil Wickremesinghe during his tenure as Prime Minister, the Presidents Media Division (PMD) reported. Accordingly, its purpose is to provide the people of Ratnapura district with a centralized location for their court-related matters. Despite the challenging economic situation, the construction of this new court complex was completed by minimizing non-essential expenses and focusing solely on essential elements, with the total expenditure for the project amounting to Rs. 1,500 million. This four-story building complex is fully equipped with all the necessary facilities for a judicial center. It includes two High Courts, a Civil Appellate High Court, two District Courts, two Magistrate Courts, a Legal Aid Center, and a Community Corrections Office. Expressing his views further President Wickremesinghe said; During the commencement of this event, as I was introduced, I proudly announced that I, in my capacity as the Prime Minister, had put forth the proposal to the Cabinet for the construction of this court complex. As you witness the magnificence of this court complex today, it is evident that it stands as a testament to our commitment to upholding the rule of law. Reflecting on my visit to this area in 1977, I was reminded of the absence of a well-developed road network. However, thanks to the efforts of Minister Nanda Mathew and Mr. Kularatne, these roads were constructed, leading to the areas progress and development. Today, as we observe this remarkable building complex, it serves as a symbol of our dedication to establishing a strong foundation for the rule of law in our country. According to our countrys constitution, the principles of peoples sovereignty and the rule of law are intrinsically intertwined, leaving no room for deviation. It is imperative that everyone lends their support to these fundamental principles. As highlighted by the Chief Justice, our judicial system boasts a rich history of over 200 years, making Sri Lanka home to the oldest legal system in Asia. Today, thanks to this impressive complex of buildings, the public enjoys great convenience. However, as our Minister of Justice and the Chief Justice have pointed out, the issue of delays in legal proceedings has become a significant problem. Swift resolutions must be found to address this matter, as a nation cannot progress if there are delays in the administration of justice. The challenges posed by legal delays are not limited to the general public; even investors encounter various problems. While I wont delve into this at length, we presented several solutions during the Bar Association meeting held in Nuwara Eliya. To tackle this issue, a comprehensive discussion has taken place among various stakeholders, including the Chief Justice, relevant government ministers, judges representing the Chief Justice, President of the Court of Appeal, High Courts, and District Magistrate Courts, as well as members of parliament from the ruling party and the opposition, representatives from the Attorney Generals Department, and the Bar Association. This collaborative effort instils hope, recognizing that this is a long-term problem that cannot be resolved by one group blaming another. Additionally, our laws must undergo reform. Some laws have remained unchanged for as long as the courts themselves. The Police Ordinance, for example, has remained unaltered for 175 years. Our Justice Minister is particularly focused on addressing this issue. In the past, new laws were enacted every six months, but now we are witnessing frequent introductions of new legislation. It is anticipated that, by the end of this year, Parliament will need to convene for three weeks instead of the usual two in order to pass these laws. Today, the religious activities of this festival commenced with utmost devotion. This signifies not only the religious fervour within our country but also highlights the protection of religious freedom as a fundamental right. Currently, the entire notion of the right to practice religion is facing challenges, and it is my hope that the Human Rights Council will reach a decision on this matter by next Thursday. Towards the end of last month, Salwan Momika sought permission from the court to burn the Quran in front of the Turkish Embassy in Sweden. Despite the police refusing permission, the Supreme Court Administrative Court ruled that it falls within the realm of the right to freedom of expression. In this instance, the police acted based on the right to practice religion, while the Supreme Court asserted the right to express opinions. The burning of the Holy Quran triggered significant uproar in the area, impacting Sweden as well as numerous other nations. The act was universally condemned, with even Israel expressing that such actions should not take place. It was emphasized that the Quran is a sacred book that pertains to the God of Abraham, and therefore, it should be treated with utmost respect. Sweden has unequivocally stated that burning the Holy Quran is an repulsive and disrespectful act, amounting to incitement. However, they subsequently emphasized the importance of constitutionally protecting freedom of expression and the right to assembly. In response to this standpoint, certain Western governments have argued that this act falls within the realm of freedom of expression. Consequently, Pakistan has taken the matter to the Geneva Human Rights Council, submitting a proposal that deems it a violation of international law. A meeting has been scheduled in Geneva on Thursday the 13th to address this issue. The central question at hand is whether this act constitutes a violation of freedom of religion or falls under the umbrella of freedom of expression. While we all perceive it as an assault on religion, some Western countries aim to broaden the concept of expression in order to alleviate the existing confusion. Nonetheless, not everything can be encompassed by freedom of expression, and there should be limits. Several international non-governmental organizations argue that if this proposal is approved, it would be a setback for Western countries. It is essential to note that this issue transcends geographical divisions, as it revolves around the right to practice religion. Personally, while I may not be a follower of Prophet Muhammad, I highly value the Holy Quran as an esteemed book. Similarly, individuals from diverse religious backgrounds can find wisdom and guidance in texts such as the Bhagavad Gita, the Bible, the Rig-Veda, and others. Thus, we collectively view this incident as an attack on religion, whereas some Western countries attempt to extend the notion of expression to alleviate the prevailing ambiguity. According to their perspective, they utilize the right of expression to promote the value system of Western countries, believing that this system should be disseminated worldwide. Democracy is something we consistently cherish and uphold, and there is no contention on that matter. However, my focus here is solely on this particular event, and I refrain from discussing other topics concerning Sri Lanka. I acknowledge that we have not fully fulfilled our obligations as per the agreement signed between the Secretary-General of the United Nations and former President Mahinda Rajapaksa. Hence, we have made the determination to fulfil our responsibilities irrespective of our personal viewpoints. We raise the question to the Geneva Human Rights Council: why is there silence on this matter? Why has the commission not issued a statement yet? Why are we waiting for a vote? This issue carries immense significance for all of us, and we must declare which value system we ought to embrace. While our judiciary draws its authority and sovereignty from the people, as members of the United Nations, we are obligated to adhere to the Declaration of Human Rights. However, the dilemma lies in deciding which value system to follow. Thus far, we have abided by all the guidelines set forth by the Geneva Human Rights Council. Nevertheless, a problem has arisen, and everything depends on the stance they adopt. The freedom of belief is inviolable and should not be challenged. Freedom of religion cannot be stripped away by cloaking it under the guise of freedom of expression through alternative interpretations. The Declaration of Human Rights was conceived when the former President of the United States Franklin D. Roosevelt affirmed freedom of speech and expression. As he stated, the second freedom is the liberty for individuals to worship God according to their own preferences. However, in the Declaration of Human Rights, this is bifurcated into religion and belief. Former US President Roosevelt correctly asserted that treating this as a matter of freedom of expression constitutes a blatant violation of an individuals freedom of religion. If we classify such actions as freedom of expression, it would necessitate rewriting history. In that case, Adolf Hitler, who burned Jewish books and synagogues, should be celebrated as a Nobel laureate. We must make a definitive choice between the two alternatives. What course of action will we take? We await the developments on Thursday. Should this be deemed a matter of expression under external pressure, it will create a distinct division between the powers of the Global South and the Western nations. Furthermore, if the decision is made to recognize this as a right to believe, clear boundaries must be established regarding the right to express opinions. This pertains to the crucial aspects of freedom of expression and the potential for public harm. Which path should we follow in this regard? I have inquired with our Foreign Minister whether this issue will be discussed within the Commonwealth. In such discussions, the Minister of Justice and other relevant parties can present their arguments. Initially, I sought to engage in a conversation with the Secretary-General of the Commonwealth. I firmly believe that the Commonwealth of Nations should assume a leading role in protecting human rights. It should not be monopolized by a single party, leading to its politicization. This right should be safeguarded for the entirety of the people. This is the greatest challenge we face. The Human Rights Council holds the responsibility to safeguard peoples right to believe and to determine whether limitations should be imposed on the right to express opinions. However, this is just the beginning. Nonetheless, I believe that the Human Rights Council should respect our own values and the rights of countries in the Global South. I have instructed the Ministry of External Affairs to steadfastly oppose any attempts to alter this course. As a member of the Commonwealth, we should take the initial step in supporting Pakistans proposal. As the Buddha wisely stated, Treat every religious leader with respect. That is precisely what we are advocating for. We are actively engaging in discussions on this matter within the Commonwealth. Minister of Justice, Prison Affairs and Constitutional Reform, Dr. Wijayadasa Rajapakshe; A year ago, our country was devoid of an effective legal framework. However, following President Ranil Wickremesinghes assumption of power, efforts have been made to reinstate the rule of law and restore normalcy to the nation. Back in 2018, the foundation stone for the construction of this court complex was laid by the former Minister of Justice, Mrs. Thalatha Athukorala. Today, after a span of five years, this court complex has been officially handed over to the people, serving as a symbol of progress. To combat corruption within the country, the Ministry of Justice has already presented over 30 new bills. This serves as a reminder that we remain committed to establishing a future where adherence to the law is paramount. The ceremony was graced by the presence of State Minister of Justice and Prison Affairs, Anuradha Jayaratne, and Chief Justice Jayantha Jayasuriya, both of whom delivered addresses. Joining the event were leaders from the Hindu, Christian, and Islamic faiths, led by Venerable Sripadasthanadhipathi, the Chief Sangha Leader of the Ratnapura District, as well as the Chancellor of the Uva Wellassa University, Venerable Bengamuwe Dhammadinna Thera. Additionally, notable attendees included Minister Pavitra Wanniarachchi, Governor of the Sabaragamuwa Province Navin Dissanayake, Members of Parliament W.D. J. Seneviratne, Thalatha Athukorala, Vasudeva Nanayakkara, Gamini Waleboda, Akila Ellawala, Attorney General Sanjay Rajaratnam, and esteemed judges from the High Court, District Court, and Magistrate Court, along with members of the Ratnapura Bar Association.",

        "date": "July 12, 2023 10:21 am",
        "content": "Donald Trump has asked for his trial on charges of illegally stashing classified documents to be postponed until after the 2024 election. In a filing on Monday, lawyers for the former US president said a proposed trial date of 11 December would deny them reasonable time to prepare. They also cited challenges in finding an impartial jury due to the election. Mr Trump pleaded not guilty to 37 counts during an arraignment in Miami, Florida, last month. Prosecutors allege he illegally held on to files with sensitive information at his Mar-a-Lago estate and obstructed federal government efforts to retrieve them. The Department of Justice has not commented on the latest filing, which applies both to Mr Trump and his aide Walt Nauta, who has also pleaded not guilty in the case. The trial date was initially set for 14 August, but it was later postponed until 11 December to give both sides more time to prepare. Prosecutors asked for that delay, anticipating the defence would oppose the initial schedule. In the filing, Mr Trumps lawyers describe the case as extraordinary and argue the amount of evidence that needs to be reviewed warrants a delay. They argue it will be challenging to prepare for the trial before the presidential election in November 2024, for which Mr Trump is currently the frontrunner to win the Republican nomination. His legal team then ask the federal court in Florida to hold off altogether on setting a new date for criminal proceedings to begin. The governments request to begin a trial of this magnitude within six months of indictment is unreasonable, telling, and would result in a miscarriage of justice, argues the document filed by Chris Kise, one of Mr Trumps lawyers. It will create extraordinary challenges in the jury selection process and limit the defendants ability to secure a fair and impartial adjudication, it adds. Judge Aileen Cannon, who is overseeing the initial stages of the case, will rule on the request. Mr Trump is facing 37 counts, including wilful retention of national defence information and obstruction of justice. According to the indictment, Mr Trump directed Mr Nauta to move boxes that were a focus of the investigation from a storage room at the resort. Prosecutors said he can be seen on surveillance footage moving the boxes. Mr Nauta, who was indicted at the same time as Mr Trump, has denied six charges, including conspiracy and making false statements. Meanwhile, in Georgia on Tuesday a grand jury was picked that may decide whether to bring charges against Mr Trump over his alleged efforts to overturn his 2020 election loss in the state. He has described the criminal investigation as a strictly political witch hunt. Source: BBC -Agencies",

        "date": "July 12, 2023 11:40 am",
        "content": "The United Kingdom on Tuesday (July 11) welcomed Sri Lankas constructive engagement with the Universal Periodic Review process and the initial steps taken to make progress in some areas since its last review. The UK government said this in a statement issued a day after the UN Human Rights Council (UNHRC) adopted the Universal Periodic Review outcomes of Sri Lanka, Japan and Pakistan on July 10. The statement for the UPR adoption of Sri Lanka had not been delivered due to time constraints. The Universal Periodic Review is a process that involves a review of human rights records of all UN member states. During the review, other member states make recommendations for how the country under review can improve its human rights situation. Meanwhile, the country under review can either accept or reject the recommendations. During its review, Sri Lanka received 294 recommendations out of which 173 were supported and 121 were noted. In its statement, the UK government has urged Sri Lanka to reconsider its position on its two other recommendations related to commemoration and memorialisation of victims of the civil war, and repealing of sections of the Penal Code to decriminalize same-sex conduct and ensure equality in relation to sexual orientation and gender identity. Sri Lanka has meanwhile accepted the UKs recommendation pertaining to concerns around land expropriation and restrictions in the north and east by government departments. The UK government, recognizing the significant political and economic challenges that Sri Lanka has faced in recent years, encouraged Sri Lanka to continue its efforts to foster political inclusion. The statement underscored the importance of reconciliation, justice and accountability for all communities, and the importance of upholding the right to freedom of assembly and expression. We reiterate our commitment to work constructively with Sri Lanka to advance the protection of human rights and to achieve justice and reconciliation.",

        "date": "July 12, 2023 12:14 pm",
        "content": "Netflix, which recently rolled out its big crackdown on password sharing, has announced an update to its Profile Transfer option. This feature is designed to make it easier for users to transfer their data to a new account, and starting today, the feature also now works for transferring to an existing account. Netflix is aiming to make it as easy as possible for users who need to create their own accounts after being impacted by the crackdown on password sharing. Profile Transfer lets people transfer their personalized recommendations, viewing history, My List, saved games, and other settings from one account to another. Since Profile Transfer launched in October, the feature has only worked for users transferring from one account to a completely new account. Starting today, however, users can transfer from one existing account to another existing account: Starting today, the profile transfer feature has been updated to allow transfers to an existing account (instead of requiring a new account), Netflix explains on its blog. This addresses one of the biggest limitations of the Profile Transfer feature for Netflix users. For example, this will let users who create their own account but arent aware of the Profile Transfer option to complete that process after the fact. Over the last several months, Netflix has ramped up its efforts to block users from sharing passwords across multiple households. In May, this finally reached the United States. The new system prevents users from sharing passwords with people outside of their households by requiring a device logged into a Netflix account to log into the home Wi-Fi network of that account at least once every 31 days. -Agencies-",

        "date": "July 12, 2023 12:23 pm",
        "content": "Heavy rainfall in southwestern Japan has caused devastating flooding and mudslides that have left at least six people dead, five missing and 19 injured, according to the Fire and Disaster Management Agency on Tuesday. Four people died in Japans Kyushu region and two people in the Chugoku region. Japans Kyushu region has been experiencing heavy rainfall since the beginning of the month and Monday saw record-breaking levels, according to the Japan Meteorological Agency. Japans weather agency issued heavy rain emergency warnings on Monday for the Fukuoka and Oita prefectures, on Kyushu, the countrys third largest island. Since Friday, some parts of Fukuoka have had more than 600 millimeters (23.6 inches) of rain, which is more than the area would usually expect for the whole of July, Reuters reported. Its raining like never before, the Japan Meteorological Agency said in a statement on Monday, which called for maximum vigilance from residents. The alert was later downgraded to a standard warning. Japan is not the only country currently grappling with intense rainfall. Northern India has been experiencing severe rains which have caused deadly flash floods and landslides, killing at least 22 people. On Sunday, Delhi had its wettest day in more than four decades, with 153 millimeters (6 inches) of rain falling. In the US, intense rain and flash flooding left at least one person dead in southeastern New York. More than four million people were under flood alerts Tuesday across the Northeast  including parts of New York, Vermont, Massachusetts and Maine. While heavy rainfall events will always happen, scientists say that climate change means they are becoming more severe. The increasing intensity of heavy rainfall events and associated flooding, such as those we are currently witnessing, is an expected consequence of a warming climate due to our emissions of greenhouse gases, said Richard Allan, a professor in climate science at the UKs University of Reading. A warmer atmosphere is able to store more water, leading to more intense rainfall when it falls. As the planet warms, the expectation is that we will see more and more intense, more frequent, more severe rainfall events, leading also to more severe flooding, said Stefan Uhlenbrook, director of hydrology, water and cryosphere at the World Meteorological Organization. Its not possible to say exactly when and where extreme rainfall events will happen, Uhlenbrook told CNN. But what is clear is that the vulnerability of societies will be different  with poorer countries often more exposed, he added. Countries like Japan are extremely alert, and theyre also very well prepared when it comes to flood defense measures, Uhlenbrook said. So even if it happens more frequently, they can probably manage this much better than low-income countries where there are no warnings in place, no flood defense structures and no integrated flood management plans.

        "date": "July 12, 2023 12:38 pm",
        "content": "State Minister of Social Empowerment Anupa Pasqual has stated that President Ranil Wickremesinghe intends on creating an entrepreneurial state instead of a welfare state. Speaking at a press conference themed Collective Path to a Stable Country held at the Presidential Media Centre (PMC) on 11 July, Pasqual explained that the purpose of both the Head of State, and the Aswesuma benefit programme, is to create a developed nation by 2048, as opposed to a poverty-free nation. Commenting further on the welfare benefit scheme, the State Minister noted that the Aswesuma programme was launched in response to a persistent social criticism, on the directives of the Head of State. The settlement program is a non-political, open process, he said. Furthermore, speaking on the Presidents plans to develop Sri Lanka into an entrepreneurial country, Pasqual noted that a welfare state is not desired, as the goals of building a developed country cannot be achieved through a welfare country. We are moving forward with these programs in line, to achieve such a state, he asserted in this regard. Commenting further on the matter, the State Minister said: We launched the Aswesuma initiative in response to a persistent social criticism. The Samurdhi Movements selection of deserving candidates was said to have involved a number of anomalies. The opposition specifically alleged that the Samurdhi initiative lacks a social empowerment system. The Social Welfare Board put the Aswesuma scheme into effect as per President Ranil Wickremesinghes directives. The settlement program is a non-political, open process. Both appeals and objections may be submitted throughout the same process. It also covers the annual procedure of admitting the qualified and removing the ineligible. The President entrusted our Ministry with enlisting 1.2 million people into the productive economy in order to empower them. Before the end of this month, the President will get the relevant plan. The empowerment of this group will be accomplished during the course of the three-year strategy. In this country, there are 1.8 million Samurdhi beneficiaries, and more than half of them are adults. Although they were engaged in various jobs when they were young, they joined the Samurdhi Movement after the age of 60. That has also been the focus of the Presidents attention, and actions have been taken to implement the pension system with help from the Social Security Board. It will be submitted to the Cabinet in the future and the necessary work will be done. Education reforms are also crucial for the cause of social empowerment. The objective is to create skilled professionals. We are receiving support for this program from China, the Asian Development Bank, World Bank, and Samurdhi Banking System. As a result, rather than eradicating poverty in Sri Lanka, we have planned to exploit the Samurdhi Bank system to generate wealthy individuals. Currently, some politicians are working very hard to misrepresent Samurdhi Bank. However, the Samurdhi economy and financial system are being promoted more vigorously thanks to the Aswesuma program. Additionally, commencing from August 1st, those who could not apply for Aswesuma this year or failed to submit appeals will have another chance to do so. Every year, a certain number of people are eligible for these benefits, and some of them drop out due to a variety of reasons. Additionally, this program provides empowerment and protection to everyone, from young children to senior citizens. Instead of eradicating poverty, President Ranil Wickremesinghe wants to see Sri Lanka become a developed nation by 2048. This serves as the required context for that. A welfare state is not what we desire. A state of entrepreneurship must be established. The goals of building a developed country cannot be achieved through a welfare country. We are moving forward with these programs in line, to achieve such a state.",

        "content": "The beneficiaries who have not submitted appeals and objections pertaining to the Aswesuma welfare benefits scheme will receive their payments starting from this month, says Finance State Minister Shehan Semasinghe. According to the lawmaker, the Welfare Benefits Board has thus far received a total of 982,770 appeals and 62,368 objections for the Aswesuma welfare benefits scheme. The government will meanwhile continue with the payments for the elderly citizens, disabled persons and kidney patients without any changes, Semasinghe said further. The Aswesuma welfare benefits program was initiated as part of the social safety net to alleviate the ongoing economic crisis, and is carried out under the purview of State Minister Semasinghe, with the involvement of various government agencies, including the Ministry of Finance. On Tuesday, Semasinghe said the District Secretaries are expected to commence assessing the appeals and objections received for the new welfare benefits scheme. He had said the government would ensure that all deserving individuals who require assistance would be included in Aswesuma. State Minister of Finance Shehan Semasinghe further commented; The time period given to all applicants whose names were not included in the list of Aswesuma beneficiaries to file appeals terminated in July 10. Accordingly 982 770 appeals and 62 368 objections has been received thus far. Arrangements have been made to commence investigations pertaining to these appeals and objections received by the Divisional Secretaries under the supervision of District Secretaries. Out of the 982 770 appeals that have been received thus far, significantly 650,000 appeals have been received by the individuals whose names are already in the published list demanding to upgrade their names from the category they are already in, to a category with more benefits. Only after investigating these appeals will a final decision will be made regarding which categories the benefits should be distributed under. They will either stay in the same category they have already been chosen or have their category modified. In addition to this, only about 350,000 appeals have been received from those who have not been selected. 1287747 families already receiving Samurdhi benefit have applied for Aswesuma. Out of them 70 (887 653) family units have been identified to be eligible to receive Aswesuma. As per the directions of President Ranil Wickremesinghe it has been decided to execute the current list of beneficiaries receiving differently-abled, elderly, and kidney support allowances without subjecting to any change until a new system is implemented within a time period of 03-06 months. We are working to make the first payment within this month for all candidates elected and who have not received objections or appeals. We believed we would get more than 800,000 appeals. Accordingly, the appeals we have received thus far are within our estimated amount. Accordingly, these appeals and objections will be promptly investigated and if the investigations reveal that he she family unit, is eligible to receive Aswesuma, their Aswesuma allowance due on July, will be added to the August allowance and paid to that family. Commencing from August 1st, those who could not apply for Aswesuma this year or failed to submit appeals will have another chance to do so. Aswesuma hopes not to cut off any benefit received by low income groups or individuals receiving any form of welfare benefit but to enter all who eligible into the welfare system without losing anyone, State Minister of Finance Shehan Semasinghe said.",

        "content": "The Chairman of the Sectoral Oversight Committee on National Economic and Physical Plans, Mahindananda Aluthgamage said that although there are 500,000 personal income tax files in this country, only 31,000 of them are paying tax. During the Sectoral Oversight Committee meeting held recently in parliament, he pointed out that there are 105,000 registered limited companies in the country, but 82 of the tax revenue is received from only 382 companies, the Department of Communications of the Parliament reported. The Chairman also emphasized that it is important to maintain the inflation, the reserves of the country and the governments income in an optimal condition by December by the time of the second review of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), given that the said factors must be taken into account when granting loans. Therefore, the chairman said that his committee will hold regular discussions with Sri Lanka Customs, Excise Department and Inland Revenue Department to provide necessary facilities to increase the state revenue, the statement said. Aluthgamage spoke at length about the failure of the Inland Revenue Department to collect the tax revenue and stated that the committee is making positive improvements in this regard. There was also a discussion about the collection of Rs. 904 billion in arrears which is due to the Inland Revenue Department, it added. Furthermore, he pointed out that discussions are being held with the Minister of Justice to amend the Inland Revenue Act. Aluthgamage also expressed that he would also provide his utmost assistance to fill the existing employee vacancies in the Inland Revenue Department. The Inland Revenue Commissioner General who spoke on the occasion said that he appreciated the support received from the Sectoral Oversight Committee on National Economic and Physical Plans to make the work of his department efficient, the parliamentary communications department mentioned. The Commissioner stated that the tax revenue target given by the government for the year 2023 of Rs. 1.6 trillion was expected to be earned by 40 in the first 6 months and 60 in the remaining 06 months, and the target for the first 6 months has already been met. Apart from the said, he stated that work is being done to generate expected tax revenue in the remaining 6 months. The Chair also mentioned that there is a need to establish a systematic mechanism to regulate the collection of tax revenue. Members as well as officials pointed out that due to the fact that the data provided for the registration of companies in this country is not true and that they have to face problems in tax collection. The Committee also discussed at length the need to establish a digital data system linking the Sri Lanka Customs Department, the Excise Department and the Inland Revenue Department as soon as possible, as well as the need to re-register the private tax file in the country, according to the statement. Members of the Committee Wimalaweera Dissanayake, Eran Wickramaratne, Sudath Manjula, Gunathilaka Rajapaksha, Dhammika Perera, Udayana Kirindigoda, Karunadasa Kodithuwakku, Madhura Withanage, Mohomad Muzammil were present at the Committee meeting held.

        "content": "The election monitoring organization PAFFREL today (July 12) filed a petition before the Supreme Court, challenging the private members bill presented to the parliament by MP Jayantha Ketagoda in a bid to amend the Municipal Councils Ordinance. The petition was put forward by Rohana Hettiarachchi, the Executive Director of PAFFREL (Peoples Action for Free and Fair Elections), seeking a court order declaring that certain provisions in the said private members bill are unconstitutional. The petitioner says the parliamentarian, through his bill, seeks to amend the Provincial Councils Ordinance in order to empower the Minister of Public Administration, Home Affairs, Provincial Councils  Local Government to re-convene the dissolved local government bodies without holding the elections. Further, the petitioner took issue with MP Ketagodas bid to empower the subject minister to extend the tenure of the re-convened local government (LG) bodies. Pursuant to legal provisions, the local government elections should be held every four years, however, authorizing the subject minister to extend the tenure of LG bodies violates the peoples right to vote, the PAFFREL chief pointed out. The petitioner thus urged the Supreme Court to issue an order stating that the private members bill in question should be passed in parliament by a two-third majority and a referendum. The Attorney General has been named the respondent of this petition. Meanwhile, the Transparency International Sri Lanka (TISL) recently deplored MP Ketagodas private members bill, deeming it anti-democratic. The rights group said this move would be a heavy blow to the peoples sovereignty enshrined in the Constitution. Local Government Members are the grass-root level public representatives. Regular elections are essential for the peoples mandate to be reflected in the LGAs (Local Government Authorities). In addition, this amendment sets a bad precedence as it creates a risk of abusing the legal framework to prevent holding timely elections, including national elections.",

        "date": "July 12, 2023 04:28 pm",
        "content": "Hackers suspected of working for Russias foreign intelligence agency targeted dozens of diplomats at embassies in Ukraine with a fake used car advert in a bid to break into their computers, according to a cybersecurity firm report published on Wednesday. The wide-reaching espionage activity targeted diplomats working in at least 22 of the roughly 80 foreign missions in Ukraines capital, Kyiv, analysts at Palo Alto Networks Unit 42 research division said in the report. The campaign began with an innocuous and legitimate event, said the report, which was first reported by Reuters. In mid-April 2023, a diplomat within the Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs emailed a legitimate flyer to various embassies advertising the sale of a used BMW 5-series sedan located in Kyiv. The Polish diplomat, who declined to be identified citing security concerns, confirmed the role of his advertisement in the digital intrusion. The hackers, known as APT29 or Cozy Bear, intercepted and copied that flyer, embedded it with malicious software, then sent it to dozens of other foreign diplomats working in Kyiv, Unit 42 said. This is staggering in scope for what generally are narrowly scoped and clandestine advanced persistent threat (APT) operations, said the report, using an acronym often used to describe state-backed cyberespionage groups. In 2021, U.S. and British intelligence agencies identified APT29 as an arm of Russias foreign Intelligence Service, the SVR. The SVR did not respond to a request from Reuters for comment about the hacking campaign. In April, Polish counterintelligence and cybersecurity authorities warned that the same group had conducted a widespread intelligence campaign against NATO member states, the European Union, and Africa. Researchers at Unit 42 were able to tie the fake car advert back to the SVR because the hackers re-used certain tools and techniques which have previously been connected to the spy agency. Diplomatic missions will always be a high-value espionage target, the Unit 42 report said. Sixteen months into the Russian invasion of Ukraine, intelligence surrounding Ukraine and allied diplomatic efforts are almost certainly a high priority for the Russian government. USED BMW The Polish diplomat said he had sent the original advert to various embassies in Kyiv, and that someone had called him back because the price looked attractive. When I checked, I realised they were talking about a slightly lower price, the diplomat told Reuters. SVR hackers, it turns out, had listed the diplomats BMW for a lower price - 7,500 euros - in their fake version of the advert, in an attempt to encourage more people to download malicious software that would give them remote access to their devices, Reuters found. That software, Unit 42 said, was disguised as an album of photographs of the used BMW. Attempts to open those photographs would have infected the targets machine, the report said. Twenty-one of the 22 embassies targeted by the hackers and subsequently contacted by Reuters did not provide comment. It was not clear which embassies, if any, had been compromised. A U.S. State Department spokesperson said they were aware of the activity and based on the Directorate of Cyber and Technology Securitys analysis found it did not affect Department systems or accounts.

        "title": "UN rights body passes disputed motion on religious hatred after Quran burning",
        "date": "July 12, 2023 04:33 pm",
        "content": "The United Nations Human Rights Council on Wednesday approved a disputed resolution on religious hatred in the wake of the burning of a Quran in Sweden, prompting concern by Western states who say it challenges long-held practices in rights protection. The resolution, introduced by Pakistan on behalf of the 57-nation Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), calls for the U.N. rights chief to publish a report on religious hatred and for states to review their laws and plug gaps that may impede the prevention and prosecution of acts and advocacy of religious hatred. It was strongly opposed by the United States and the European Union, who say it conflicts with their view on human rights and freedom of expression. While condemning the burning of the Quran, they argued the OIC initiative was designed to safeguard religious symbols rather than human rights. An Iraqi immigrant to Sweden burned the Quran outside a Stockholm mosque last month, sparking outrage across the Muslim world and demands by Muslim states for action. The votes outcome marks a major defeat for Western countries at a time when the OIC has unprecedented clout in the council, the only body made up of governments to protect human rights worldwide. Twenty-eight countries voted in favour, 12 voted against, and seven countries abstained. Representatives of some countries clapped after the resolution passed. Marc Limon, director of the Geneva-based Universal Rights Group, said the outcome showed the West is in full retreat at the Human Rights Council. Theyre increasingly losing support and losing the argument, he said. Michele Taylor, the U.S. Permanent Representative to the U.N. Human Rights Council, said the United States concerns about the initiative were not taken seriously. I believe with a little more time and more open discussion, we could have also found a way forward together on this resolution, she said. After the vote, Pakistans Permanent Representative to the U.N. in Geneva, Khalil Hasmi, accused the West of lip service to their commitment to prevent religious hatred. The opposition of a few in the room has emanated from their unwillingness to condemn the public desecration of the Holy Quran or any other religious book, he said. They lack political, legal and moral courage to condemn this act, and it was the minimum that the Council could have expected from them. Source: Reuters -Agencies",

        "date": "July 12, 2023 06:07 pm",
        "content": "China on Wednesday successfully launched the worlds first methane-powered rocket into space. The development marked the first orbital mission fueled by methane, a cutting-edge technology that until now had only been developed by the American companies SpaceX and Blue Origin. The rocket, named Zhuque-2 Y2, lifted off from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in Chinas Gobi desert, said its manufacturer LandSpace, a private Chinese space company. LandSpace claimed that the success of the mission verified various schemes of the rocket and laid a solid foundation for the development of reusable rockets in the next stage, according to national broadcaster CGTN. The rocket uses liquid methane as fuel and liquid oxygen as an oxidizer  a non-toxic mix of reusable components also known as methalox. The launcher has a two-stage configuration, with a diameter of 3.35 meters, a height of 49.5 meters, a takeoff weight of 219 tons, and a takeoff thrust of 268 tons. It is the second test flight of the Zhuque-2 after a failed attempt in December last year. The latest mission took a series of improvement measures and verified their effectiveness through simulations, ground tests, and engine tests. LandSpace said that after the successful test flight, they would further optimize the rocket, accumulate experiences for its reliability and safety, and lay the foundation to bring low-cost, high-performance products to the market. Last May, an experimental reusable spacecraft returned to China after spending 276 days in orbit, which was described by state media as a major breakthrough in reusable spacecraft technology research. The technology for recovering the most expensive rocket parts at sea could be applied to future Chinese rocket models, which would lower the cost of space exploration. Other companies like the American SpaceX have developed recoverable parts in recent years. Source - EFE - Agencies",

        "date": "July 12, 2023 09:13 pm",
        "content": "Fitch Ratings has revised the Outlook on Ceylon Electricity Boards (CEB) National Long-Term Rating to Positive, from Stable, and has simultaneously affirmed the rating at B(lka). Fitch also affirmed the National Long-Term Rating of CEBs outstanding senior unsecured debentures at B(lka). The Positive Outlook reflects the likely upgrade of the Sri Lankan sovereigns Long-Term Local-Currency Issuer Default Rating (IDR) to reflect the sovereigns prospects following the completion of a domestic debt exchange (DDE). We will equalise CEBs ratings with that of the sovereign if the sovereigns Long-Term Local-Currency IDR is upgraded to above CC, in line with our Government-Related Entities (GRE) Rating Criteria, resulting in a rating upgrade on the national scale. This is based on our assessment of a strong likelihood of support from the state. The affirmation follows our de-linking of CEBs rating from that of the sovereign after we downgraded Sri Lankas Long-Term Local-Currency IDR to C, from CC on 5 July 2023. This is because, despite the governments selective default on some of its local-currency debt, we do not believe CEB has entered a default or default-like process requiring a similar rating action. In addition, CEBs current rating already reflects a probable near-term default, as the companys ability to service debt depends on the continuity of government support. KEY RATING DRIVERS State Support Intact: The government continues to provide financial support to CEB to sustain its operations, which would have been otherwise challenging. The government converted a LKR200 billion project loan, amounting to 35 of CEBs outstanding debt as at 30 September 2022, to equity late last year, while state banks continued to provide working capital funding to secure feedstock. The government has also facilitated uninterrupted fuel supply to CEBs thermal power plants from state-owned Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC), despite CEB having large dues to CPC. We believe state support will be forthcoming, despite the states weak financial profile, as CEB fulfils an essential service for the country. A default of CEB would disrupt this service, as the company accounts for most of Sri Lankas power-generation capacity. It would also make it difficult for CEB to source imported feedstock for power generation, such as heavy oil and coal. CEBs independent power producer (IPP) agreements, which account for around 20 of the power generated, would also be affected, as they are external arrangements with no clear alternatives. Cost Reflective Tariff Mechanism: The government has established a formula-based tariff mechanism to ensure CEBs operating costs and interest obligations are recovered going forward. Prior to this, CEB supplied electricity at significant subsidies, resulting in large accumulated losses and an unsustainable capital structure. The consistent application of the cost-reflective tariff mechanism should allow CEB to breakeven at the cash flow from operations level, but such implementation has yet to be proven. Indeterminate Standalone Profile: We dont believe ascertaining standalone credit profile of CEB is possible in the foreseeable future, as its ability to operate depends on continued state support and it cannot be meaningfully delinked from the government. CEB had LKR284 billion of debt equally spread across working capital and project loans as at end-April 2023. We expect CEB to generate negative free cash flow in the medium term, despite the tariff mechanism, and to depend on the state for expansion and refinancing. We may provide a standalone credit view should CEB maintain a record of profitable operation that improves its access to external funding with less reliance on the state. Large Dues to Operating Creditors: CEB owed LKR208 billion to CPC, IPPs and renewable energy generators as of end-April 2023, up by 20 from November 2022. CEB expects to settle its debt to CPC and some IPPs with support from the government, while the renewable producers will be settled incrementally with cash generated from operations. CEB plans to settle part of the dues owed to renewables producers through new funding lines, but approvals are taking time. Consequently, we do not expect a material reduction CEBs trade payable position in 2023. CEB Restructure: The government is looking at unbundling CEBs generation, transmission and distribution process by transferring CEBs resources to 14 companies established under the Companies Act as part of the countrys energy sector reforms. We expect the unbundling to provide autonomy and flexibility for CEB operations, while improving its efficiency and competitiveness, but it is too early to ascertain how the proposed restructure would affect CEBs credit profile, as the plans details are still vague. -Fitch-",

        "content": "The Committee on Public Enterprises (COPE) has discovered that the online auctioning system for coconut harvests, introduced with the aim of demolishing the monopoly Mafia has been opposed and obstructed as a result of the agenda of the brokers. During the COPE session, the Chairman of the Coconut Development authority Roshan Perera emphasized that the reluctance was noted as a result of their preference to the practical or offline procedure. However, the Auditor General P.C Wickremeratne mentioned that the process does not suit present requirements nor does it efficiently execute the national coconut auction brief. In the meantime, Jagath Pushpakumara, a member of the COPE expressed that the coconut auction is handled by 4 or 5 brokers, adding that at present, all of them represent one entity. What was proposed was to introduce a mechanism that enables the purchasing of our coconut by buyers residing across the world. This does not require a traditional auction system. A silent auction can be held. Potential buyers have to register and place their bid bonds, he said. Mr. Pushpakumara, who alleged that these 04 brokers are controlling the coconut prices by abusing the current system, also questioned why the initially discussed system cannot be implemented. The Coconut Development Authoritys Chairman, Prof. Roshan Perera claimed in reply that the reluctance of buyers and brokers in participating via this system is an issue because they want an offline system. Meanwhile Sanjeeva Edirimanna, who is also a member of the committee raised concerns that the digital platforms continue to fail in most state enterprises, adding that the issue, is prevalent in most of the entities which he knows of. However, the Coconut Development Authoritys Chairman also alleged that although they have received the source codes of the said digital platform, they however dont have a server. We can enter the source codes once a server is installed, he said. However, the Auditor General emphasized that a server can be independently hired to achieve the required purpose. In addition, Jagath Pushpakumara further stressed that a state enterprise cannot be operated according to the whims and fancies of brokers, questioning why the authority cannot arrive at a decision regarding the matter. This procedure was implemented in order to end this mafia. This is controlled by few people, he alleged.",

        "date": "July 13, 2023 10:14 am",
        "content": "The European Parliament has voted to pass a fiercely contested law to restore degraded natural ecosystems, salvaging the environmental measures that centre-right lawmakers had campaigned to kill off. European Union lawmakers on Wednesday adopted the legal proposal with 336 votes in favour, 300 against, and 13 abstentions. Lawmakers and member countries will negotiate the final text, aiming for a deal before EU Parliament elections in 2024. We have won. It is a social victory: for scientists, for young people, for a lot of companies and businesses, for the agricultural sector, Cesar Luena, the parliaments lead negotiator on the law, told reporters after the vote. Deep divisions The decision came after months of political campaigning that exposed deep divisions among EU countries and lawmakers over the proposal, with some government leaders warning that Europe is pushing through too many environmental laws as part of its overall green agenda. The new legislation will require countries to introduce measures restoring nature on a fifth of their land and sea by 2030. The aim is to reverse the decline of Europes natural habitats  81 percent of which are classed as being in poor health. Restoring nature brings numerous benefits to farmers such as revitalising soils, supporting pollinators and buffering them from the worsening impacts of climate change. It is as simple as this: we cannot grow food on dead soil, EU lawmaker Mohammed Chahim said after the vote. The European Peoples Party (EPP), the European Parliaments biggest lawmaker group, led a campaign to reject the plan on the grounds it would harm farmers and endanger food security. That is despite Ursula von der Leyen  the head of the European Commission, which proposed the nature law  being from the EPP party. We fear that this law will be counterproductive and have significant social and economic consequences, the EPP group said in a tweet. Other lawmakers and scientists have rejected the EPPs claims, accusing the group of using misinformation to court votes before EU Parliament elections next year. The group denies this. This law is not against anybody, Luena said. This is a law on behalf of nature, not against any person whatsoever. Luena thanked the scientists and young people who had supported the law  among them Swedish activist Greta Thunberg, who attended the EU assembly on Wednesday to watch the vote. Brussels has already passed dozens of CO2-cutting laws to deliver the EUs overall green agenda, including its goal to reach net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. But recent environmental proposals have hit resistance  particularly those that would require changes from farmers to tackle environmental pollution and the collapse of bee and butterfly populations. EU lawmakers voted earlier this week to weaken another law to cut pollution from farms. Source: Reuters -Agencies",

As the authorities began upgrading the tracks in January this year, this stretch of the railway track remained closed for the past six months with train operations between Anuradhapura and Omanthai being suspended. Measures were taken to provide public transport facilities to the general public by deploying passenger buses between the two destinations. Upgrading of the railway tracks is handled by Indias state-run Indian Railway Construction International (IRCON), under an Indian credit line of USD 91.27 million. Under the first phase of this project, a stretch of 48km on the railway line from Anuradhapura to Vavuniya was renovated, and subsequently, a stretch of 31km up to Omanthai was upgraded.

        "date": "July 13, 2023 12:13 pm",
        "content": "The International Monetary Funds (IMF) board has given its approval for a 3bn (2.3bn) bailout for Pakistan. The crisis-hit nation will get about 1.2bn upfront, with the rest due to be paid out over the next nine months. The South Asian nation was on the brink of defaulting on its debts and had barely enough in foreign currencies to pay for a month of imports. This week, the country also received funds from allies Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Pakistans Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said the bailout was a major step forward in efforts to stabilise the economy. It bolsters Pakistans economic position to overcome immediate to medium-term economic challenges, giving next government the fiscal space to chart the way forward, he said. The IMF deal came after eight months of tough negotiations over how to deal with serious long-term issues with Pakistans ailing economy. The country had been on the brink of being unable to meet debt repayments to creditors. Much of the country was hit by devastating floods last year, which added to other major problems faced by the country, including high inflation and economic mismanagement by successive governments. Saudi Arabia deposited 2bn with Pakistans central bank on Tuesday, Pakistans Finance Minister Ishaq Dar said. On Wednesday, Mr Dar said the central bank had also received 1bn from the UAE. The energy-rich Middle Eastern nations had pledged the money in April,but held off handing it over until it was certain that the IMF bailout would be finalised. The IMF deal, along with the money from Saudi Arabia and the UAE, will unlock more funds to help support Pakistans ailing economy. Pakistans foreign exchange reserves are expected to rise to around 15bn by the end of this month, Mr Dar has said. On Monday, the credit rating agency Fitch upgraded Pakistans sovereign rating, with the deal bringing some relief to investors in the countrys stocks and bonds. The heavily-indebted countrys bonds have soared since the end of June, when the IMF gave preliminary approval for the bailout. Mr Sharifs coalition government, which is due to face a national election this year, still has to make major spending cuts to meet the conditions of the bailout. The cost of living has been soaring in Pakistan. The official annual rate of inflation currently stands at almost 30. Last month, the countrys central bank raised its main interest rate to a record high of 22 as it struggled to curb rising prices. This weeks bailout is the latest in a long line of support Pakistan has received from the IMF. It has taken more than 20 loans from the international lender since 1958. Source: BBC -Agencies",

        "date": "July 13, 2023 12:54 pm",
        "content": "The government expects to spend Rs. 206 billion annually on the Aswesuma program despite only Rs. 144 billion being spent on welfare benefits in 2022, Finance State Minister Shehan Semasinghe says. As per the agreements with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank, Sri Lanka had agreed to spend a minimum of Rs. 187 billion annually to uplift the poor and vulnerable in the country, however, the government has gone above and beyond earmarking Rs. 62 billion on welfare benefits this year in comparison to 2022. Addressing a press conference held at the Presidential Media Centre on Wednesday (July 12), Semasinghe said it has taken about 20 years to put in line a systematic and transparent method to identify the underprivileged and those in need of welfare benefits. Speaking on the Aswesuma welfare benefits scheme, the state minister noted that out of the 982,770 appeals received thus far, a total of 650,000 have been submitted by the individuals whose names are already included in the published list, demanding that their names be upgraded from the category they are already in, to a category with more benefits. The Welfare Benefits Board has meanwhile received 62,368 objections for the Aswesuma program. He mentioned that all selected Aswesuma beneficiaries who have submitted neither appeals nor objections would receive the first payment within this month for all candidates elected and who have not received objections or appeals, State Minister Shehan Semasinghe said.",

        "content": "The renovated stretch of railway track between Anuradhapura and Omanthai on the Northern Line was officially launched for public transport today (July 13), Highways Minister Bandula Gunawardena says. Air-conditioned luxury carriages were added for the test run with a speed of 100kmph, the lawmaker mentioned while inspecting the renovated railway tracks. As renovations began, the Anuradhapura-Omanthai stretch of the railway line remained closed since January. This led to a temporary halt in train operations between the two destinations and steps were taken to provide public transport facilities to the general public by deploying passenger buses. Upgrading of the railway tracks is handled by Indias state-run Indian Railway Construction International (IRCON), under an Indian credit line of USD 91.27 million. Under the first phase of this project, a stretch of 48km on the railway line from Anuradhapura to Vavuniya was renovated, and subsequently, a stretch of 31km up to Omanthai was upgraded.",

        "content": "The decision to grant a presidential pardon to the Royal Park murder convict, Jude Jayamaha was not an arbitrary move, President Maithripala Sirisena told the Supreme Court today (July 13). Shramantha Jayamaha was convicted of murdering 19-year-old Swedish national, Yvonne Jonsson on July 01, 2005, and was sentenced to 12 years in prison by the Colombo High Court. In 2012, the Appeals Court overturned the sentence on Shramantha Jayamaha from 12 years to a death sentence. Later, in October 2013, the Supreme Court confirmed the death sentence given by the Appeals Court to Shramantha Jayamaha. In early November 2019, former President Sirisena released the convict on a presidential pardon. During court proceedings today, Presidents Counsel Faisz Mustapha, who represented Sirisena, told the judge bench that the decision to commute the death sentence handed to the murder convict to life imprisonment had been made pursuant to all provisions under the Constitution. The decision was made based on the recommendations of a report compiled by a spcial committee consisting of the then-Commissioner General of Prisons, then-Justice Minister and civil organizations, Mustapha said further. As the second step of this presidential pardon, the murder convict was released from prison, the former presidents lawyer further told the court, clarifying that this too was done after taking into account the special requests made by parliamentarians, the convicts mother and social activists.",

        "date": "July 13, 2023 04:35 pm",
        "content": "Elon Musk on Wednesday announced the formation of a new company focused on artificial intelligence, after months of teasing plans to build a rival to ChatGPT. The company, called xAI, unveiled a website and a team of a dozen staffers. The new company will be led by Musk, according to the website, and will work closely with X (Twitter), Tesla, and other companies to make progress towards our mission. The goal of xAI is to understand the true nature of the universe, the website states, echoing language Musk has used before to describe his AI ambitions. Musk was an early backer of ChatGPT-creator OpenAI, but later criticized the company for inputting safeguards that aim to prevent the viral chatbot from spewing biased or sexist responses. The danger of training AI to be woke  in other words, lie  is deadly, Musk tweeted in December, responding to a Twitter user who asked OpenAIs CEO if it was possible to turn off the woke settings on ChatGPT. In an interview with then-Fox News host Tucker Carlson in April, Musk said teased plans for his new AI venture. Were going to start something which I call TruthGPT, he said, describing it as a maximum truth-seeking AI that cares about understanding the universe. Musks announcement of the new company comes months after he warned in an interview that he thinks AI could cause civilization destruction and joined other tech leaders in calling for a pause in an out of control AI race. Few other details on the companys mission were immediately available, but the website indicates it is actively recruiting staff. At the moment, all of the dozen staffers on the website appear to be men. The announcement of Musks latest venture comes at a precarious moment for Musk. Twitter, the company he acquired for 44 billion in October, now faces an uncertain future after Meta launched a rival app called Threads. Metas app topped 100 million sign-ups in less than a week. Meanwhile, there were multiple reports of Twitters usage declining. The turbulence at Twitter comes after months of Musk alienating some users and advertisers by slashing staff, pushing through controversial policy changes and making a number of incendiary remarks. In addition to Twitter, Musk runs several other companies, including Tesla, SpaceX, Neuralink and The Boring Company. Source: CNN -Agencies",

        "date": "July 13, 2023 05:12 pm",
        "content": "One of Britains leading television news anchors, Huw Edwards, was identified by his wife on Wednesday as the BBC presenter facing allegations he paid a young person thousands of pounds for sexually explicit photos, the broadcaster reported. Edwards announced the death of Queen Elizabeth to the nation in September and has led coverage of the biggest events in Britain since the turn of the century, including elections, royal weddings and the 2012 Olympics. His wife, Vicky Flind, said she was making a statement out of concern for Edwards mental health and to protect their children, after the initial report by the Sun newspaper dominated the news agenda and sparked days of speculation. Huw is suffering from serious mental health issues. As is well documented, he has been treated for severe depression in recent years, Flind said in a statement, according to the BBC. The events of the last few days have greatly worsened matters, he has suffered another serious episode and is now receiving in-patient hospital care where hell stay for the foreseeable future. The story first broke on Friday when the Sun tabloid reported a leading BBC presenter had paid a young person 35,000 pounds (45,000) for explicit photos over three years, beginning when the person was 17. The BBC suspended the presenter but did not name him. Several BBC stars then took to social media to say they were not involved after speculation swirled online. The BBC came under fire as it struggled to investigate the claim against the presenter, protect the persons privacy, respond publicly to the allegations, and not anger other presenters who fell under suspicion. The age of consent for sex in England is 16, but images of someone under 18 can be considered child pornography. Londons Metropolitan Police said earlier on Wednesday it had concluded its assessment into the allegations and found there was no indication a criminal offence had been committed. There is no further police action, it said. The BBC said it would continue with its internal investigation into the allegations. In an email to staff, BBC Director General Tim Davie said it remained a very complex set of circumstances. This will no doubt be a difficult time for many after a challenging few days. I want to reassure you that our immediate concern is our duty of care to all involved, he said. A spokesperson for The Sun said the newspaper had no plans to publish further allegations and would cooperate with the BBCs investigation. We will provide the BBC team with a confidential and redacted dossier containing serious and wide-ranging allegations which we have received, including some from BBC personnel, the spokesperson said. Edwards, who has five children, has worked for the BBC since 1984 and has anchored its flagship BBC News at Ten bulletin for more than two decades. He is the broadcasters highest paid news presenter, earning in the 435,000 to 439,999 pounds band (about 565,000). Flind said she hoped the statement would bring an end to media speculation which had had an impact on Edwards BBC colleagues. Once well enough to do so, he intends to respond to the stories that have been published, she said. Source: Reuters -Agencies",

        "date": "July 13, 2023 06:42 pm",
        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe today (July 13) stressed the importance of financial discipline in nation-building and announced plans to promptly introduce formal measures to control public expenditure and generate new government revenue. The Head of State highlighted the need to maximize the value of every rupee spent by the government, as currently, public expenditure often fails to achieve this objective. He expressed concern over not only the neglect of public revenue but also the unrestricted spending of public funds on non-beneficial activities, which has contributed to the economic crisis in the country. Speaking further, President Wickremesinghe attributed the current financial problems to the lack of parliamentary discussions on this matter in the past two or three years. To address this issue, he informed that several committees have been established in the parliament to examine the states financial situation and income tax matters. He made these remarks during the presentation of a report by the committee chaired by State Minister for Finance, Economic Stabilization, and National Policy, Ranjith Siyambalapitiya, which aims to propose strategies for generating new sources of income for the state. The report was submitted to the President by State Minister Ranjith Siyambalapitiya at the Presidential Secretariat on Wednesday (July 12). The report encompasses recommendations aimed at establishing a structured framework to attain the revenue goals of the Inland Revenue Department, Sri Lanka Customs, and the Excise Department, the Presidents Media Division (PMD) says. It also suggests the implementation of novel approaches to augment government revenue and the creation of a digital economic infrastructure to support these endeavours. President Ranil Wickremesinghe directed the Minister of State to engage in further discussions regarding these proposals and present them to the Parliamentary Committee on Ways and Means. Furthermore, the President emphasized the utmost importance of leveraging digital technology to its fullest potential in implementing these recommendations. He also emphasized the necessity of formally informing the public about these initiatives through an extensive media campaign.",

        "content": "Another petition has been filed before the Supreme Court challenging the constitutionality of the private members bill presented to the parliament by SLPP MP Jayantha Ketagoda seeking amendments to the Municipal ordinances on urban councils and municipal councils. The second petition was filed by the general secretary of Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB), Ranjith Madduma Bandara, naming the Attorney General as its respondent. The petitioner says the private members bill tabled by MP Ketagoda seeks to amend the Provincial Councils Ordinance and the Urban Councils Ordinance in order to empower the Minister of Public Administration, Home Affairs, Provincial Councils  Local Government to re-convene the dissolved local government bodies without holding the elections. Further, the petitioner raises concerns about the parliamentarians attempt to empower the subject minister to extend the tenure of the re-convened local government bodies. Pursuant to legal provisions, the local government elections should be held every four years, however, authorizing the subject minister to extend the tenure of LG bodies violates the peoples right to vote, the SJB general secretary further noted. Accordingly, the petitioner has urged the Supreme Court to issue an order stating that the private members bill in question should be passed in parliament by a two-third majority and a referendum. The first petition against MP Ketagodas private members bill was filed by the Executive Director of PAFFREL (Peoples Action for Free and Fair Elections) Rohana Hettiarachchi. Meanwhile, Transparency International Sri Lanka (TISL) recently deplored MP Ketagodas private members bill, deeming it anti-democratic. The rights group said this move would be a heavy blow to the peoples sovereignty enshrined in the Constitution. Local Government Members are the grass-root level public representatives. Regular elections are essential for the peoples mandate to be reflected in the LGAs (Local Government Authorities). In addition, this amendment sets a bad precedence as it creates a risk of abusing the legal framework to prevent holding timely elections, including national elections.",

Speaking on the death of 21-year-old Chamodi Sandeepani, who died while receiving treatment at the Peradeniya Teaching Hospital for indigestion issues, the Director of the hospital, Dr. Arjuna Thilakaratne, explained that the relevant drug administered, Ceftriaxone, is an antibiotic due to be injected in 2mg doses, once a day. It is difficult to say that this was caused because of the drug. It is an allergic reaction. We have administered 2,700 doses of Ceftriaxone to other patients , he said. Responding to the medias questions, Dr. Thilakaratne confirmed that the two vials administered via the cannula were both 1mg of Ceftriaxone, adding that the young woman had shown no signs of an allergic reaction following the administration of the first vial. She started showing signs of an allergic reaction only two to three minutes after both vials were administered, he said in this regard. Meanwhile, speaking further on the medication in question, the Head of the hospitals Physiological Department, Prof. Udaya Ralapanawa also noted that while C-Reactive protein (CRP) must be recorded at a level of 6 units normally, that of the deceased was recorded at 270 units, indicating a sever bacterial infection. In such situations, Ceftriaxone is the generally administered drug, and there are rarely any complications, he explained. Chamodi Sandeepani was admitted to the Peradeniya Teaching Hospital on 11 July for further treatment for indigestion issues, after being transferred from the Kotaligoda District Hospital. Speaking to Ada Derana about the incident, the mother of the deceased explained that Chamodis body had turned blue and her condition had worsened after the medication in question was administered. They administered two medications via the cannula, and immediately after, my daughter told me that something was wrong.

        "content": "The bank accounts of six individuals, identified as members of the Board of Directors of ONMAX DT, a private firm believed to be a pyramid scheme, have been frozen, on orders of the Colombo Chief Magistrates Court. Accordingly, the relevant bank accounts are believed to have deposits amounting to Rs. 790 million, while 95 accounts belonging to the said company have been suspended thus far. Investigations were launched into the firm by the Financial Crimes Investigation Division, based on a complaint received from the Director of the Financial Intelligence Unit of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL). In their complaint, CBSL officials highlighted the fact that ONMAX DT was, in fact, a confirmed pyramid scheme, and thus, facts in this regard were presented before the Colombo Chief Magistrates Court on Wednesday (12 July), by the Financial Crimes Investigation Division. There, the investigating officers told the court that six members on the Board of Directors of the company, namely, Sampath Sandaruwan, Athula Indika Sampath, Gayashan Abeyratne, Madhuranga Prasanna, Saranga Randika and Dhananjaya Gayan had deposits amounting to Rs. 790 million in their bank accounts. Subsequently, the court ordered that the accounts in question be suspended, along with the Rs. 790 million. While the total sum defrauded by the company is yet to be determined, the investigating officers believe that the figure is at least twenty times more than the money found in the suspended accounts. However, no complaints against the pyramid scheme have been received from the public thus far, the police said, urging any individual who fell prey to the scheme to come forward, and lodge a complaint in this regard at their nearest police station.",

        "title": "SJB to move no-confidence motion against health minister?",
        "date": "July 14, 2023 09:56 am",
        "content": "The Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) has decided to lodge a complaint with the World Health Organization (WHO) seeking action against those responsible for weakening the countrys healthcare sector. Speaking on the matter, main oppositions MP Kavinda Jayawardena said the SJB is also mulling moving a no-confidence motion against Health Minister Keheliya Rambukwella. The parliamentarian mentioned this speaking to the media following a meeting with Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa. Meanwhile, Dr. Chamal Sanjeewa, chief secretary of the Physicians Union Alliance for Medicine and Civil Rights, said reports have revealed that substandard surgical instruments are being used on cancer patients. Days after the death of a young woman, who was under medical care at the Peradeniya Teaching Hospital which sparked controversy, another patient receiving medical attention at a state hospital has died of a suspected infection from an intravenous cannula. The deceased is reportedly an employee of the National Medicines Regulatory Authority (NMRA). He was initially admitted to a state hospital in Galle with high fever, and the intravenous cannula inserted into his veins is said to have become infected, after a bacterial contamination. The patient was later moved to the Panadura Base Hospital, where the doctors tried to transfer him to another hospital after learning that he suffers from a heart disease. However, the patient was pronounced dead shortly after, and the infection on the intravenous cannula site is suspected to be the cause of death. Meanwhile, officials of Peradeniya Teaching Hospital stressed that the death of 21-year-old Chamodi Sandeepani, who died while receiving medical attention at the hospital, was caused by an allergic reaction to a medication she was administered. The director of the hospital, Dr. Arjuna Thilakaratne, explained that the relevant drug Ceftriaxone is an antibiotic due to be injected in 2mg doses, once a day. Responding to the media queries, Dr. Thilakaratne confirmed that the two vials administered via the cannula were both 1mg of Ceftriaxone, adding that the young woman had shown no signs of an allergic reaction following the administration of the first vial. According to him, the patient had shown signs of allergic reaction only two or three minutes after both vials were administered. Hospitals Physiological Department, Prof. Udaya Ralapanawa also noted that while C-Reactive protein (CRP) must be recorded at a level of 6 units normally, however, CRP that of the deceased was recorded at 270 units, indicating a severe bacterial infection. He explained that in such situations, Ceftriaxone is the generally administered drug, and there are rarely any complications.",

        "title": "Hollywood actors join screenwriters in historic strike action",
        "date": "July 14, 2023 10:46 am",
        "content": "Hollywood actors have announced they will join an ongoing strike by screenwriters in the industrys biggest shutdown for more than 60 years. The Screen Actors Guild (SAG) wants streaming giants to agree to a fairer split of profits and better working conditions. Some 160,000 performers will stop work at midnight. The stoppage means the vast majority of US film and TV productions will grind to a halt. Stars Cillian Murphy, Matt Damon and Emily Blunt left the premiere of Christopher Nolans Oppenheimer in London on Thursday night as the strike was declared. The SAG walkout starts at midnight Los Angeles time (08:00 BST). Picketing will begin on Friday morning outside the California headquarters of Netflix, before moving on to Paramount, Warner Bros and Disney. The union - officially known as the Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists, or SAG-AFTRA - also wants a guarantee that artificial intelligence (AI) and computer-generated faces and voices will not be used to replace actors. The group representing the studios, the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, or AMPTP, slammed the decision. It said a strike is certainly not the outcome we hoped for as studios cannot operate without the performers that bring our TV shows and films to life. The union has regrettably chosen a path that will lead to financial hardship for countless thousands of people who depend on the industry, its statement added. To address concerns about the use of AI, the AMPTP said it had agreed to a groundbreaking proposal that would protect the digital likeness of actors, and require their consent when digital replicas are used in performances, or alterations are made. But the SAGs national executive director and chief negotiator, Duncan Crabtree-Ireland, said the offer was unacceptable. They propose that our background performers should be able to be scanned, get paid for one days pay, and their company should own that scan of their image, their likeness, and should be able to use it for the rest of eternity, he said. If you think thats a groundbreaking proposal, I suggest you think again. Another SAG demand of the streaming services is that actors receive greater base pay and residuals - meaning payments made to actors from repeats of films and programmes theyve starred in. The strike includes tens of thousands of actors who receive significantly less pay for bit parts than their A-list colleagues. In the old model, they get residuals based on success, Kim Masters, the editor-in-chief of the Hollywood Reporter, told the BBC. In the new model, they dont get to find out whats going on behind the scenes, because the streamers dont share. Fran Drescher, SAGs president, said the strike comes at a very seminal moment for actors in the industry. Whats happening to us is happening across all fields of labour, she said, when employers make Wall Street and greed their priority, and they forget about the essential contributors that make the machine run. A separate strike by the 11,500 members of the Writers Guild of America demanding better pay and working conditions has been going since 2 May. Some writers have turned to projects that are not covered by the contract between the guild and the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers. The double strike by both unions is the first since 1960, when the SAG was led by actor Ronald Reagan, long before he entered politics and became US president. The last strike by actors took place in 1980. Speaking during a gathering of industry leaders at an Idaho resort ahead of the SAGs announcement on Thursday, Disney CEO Bob Iger said the demands of both actors and writers were impractical and damaging to an industry still recovering from the pandemic. Its very disturbing to me, Mr Iger said. This is the worst time in the world to add to that disruption. A third union, the Directors Guild of America, successfully negotiated a contract in June and will not participate. The walkout will add to a list of projects that have already shut down or stalled because of the writers strike. For films in production, it means a large portion of work will become impossible. Even in cases in which filming has already been completed, actors will be unavailable for re-shoots and other essential elements of the filmmaking process. TV shows that are still being filmed will also largely have to stop as actors become unavailable, although in some cases side deals could be struck between performers and producers to allow work to continue. Top Hollywood stars will not be able to attend events to promote new and upcoming releases. Events including the Emmys and Comic-Con may be rescheduled or scaled back. International events, such as the Toronto and Venice film festivals, will still go on, although SAG actors will be unable to attend as they do each year. In the hours following the announcement, several SAG-affiliated actors took to Instagram to voice their support for the strike, including Better Call Saul star Bob Odenkirk, Sex and the Citys Cynthia Nixon and Hollywood veteran Jamie Lee Curtis.

        "title": "WHO cancer agency deems artificial sweetener aspartame possibly carcinogenic",
        "date": "July 14, 2023 11:18 am",
        "content": "Aspartame, a popular artificial non-sugar sweetener used in food and beverage products is a possible carcinogen, two groups linked to the World Health Organization (WHO) declare on Thursday (July 13). Assessments of the health impacts of aspartame were released by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) and the World Health Organization (WHO)Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) Joint Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA). Citing limited evidence for carcinogenicity in humans, IARC classified aspartame as possibly carcinogenic to humans (IARC Group 2B) and JECFA reaffirmed the acceptable daily intake of 40 mgkg body weight. Aspartame is an artificial (chemical) sweetener widely used in various food and beverage products since the 1980s, including diet drinks, chewing gum, gelatin, ice cream, dairy products such as yogurt, breakfast cereal, toothpaste and medications such as cough drops and chewable vitamins. Cancer is one of the leading causes of death globally. Every year, 1 in 6 people die from cancer. Science is continuously expanding to assess the possible initiating or facilitating factors of cancer, in the hope of reducing these numbers and the human toll, said Dr Francesco Branca, Director of the Department of Nutrition and Food Safety, WHO. According to Branca, the assessments of aspartame have indicated that, while safety is not a major concern at the doses which are commonly used, potential effects have been described that need to be investigated by more and better studies. The two bodies conducted independent but complementary reviews to assess the potential carcinogenic hazard and other health risks associated with aspartame consumption. The WHO says this was the first time that IARC has evaluated aspartame and the third time for JECFA. After reviewing the available scientific literature, both evaluations have noted limitations in the available evidence for cancer (and other health effects). IARC classified aspartame as possibly carcinogenic to humans (Group 2B) on the basis of limited evidence for cancer in humans (specifically, for hepatocellular carcinoma, which is a type of liver cancer). There was also limited evidence for cancer in experimental animals and limited evidence related to the possible mechanisms for causing cancer. JECFA concluded that the data evaluated indicated no sufficient reason to change the previously established acceptable daily intake (ADI) of 040 mgkg body weight for aspartame. The committee therefore reaffirmed that it is safe for a person to consume within this limit per day. For example, with a can of diet soft drink containing 200 or 300 mg of aspartame, an adult weighing 70kg would need to consume more than 914 cans per day to exceed the acceptable daily intake, assuming no other intake from other food sources. IARCs hazard identifications are the first fundamental step to understand the carcinogenicity of an agent by identifying its specific properties and its potential to cause harm, i.e. cancer. IARC classifications reflect the strength of scientific evidence as to whether an agent can cause cancer in humans, but they do not reflect the risk of developing cancer at a given exposure level. The IARC hazard evaluation considers all types of exposures (e.g. dietary, occupational). The strength-of-evidence classification in Group 2B is the third highest level out of 4 levels, and it is generally used either when there is limited, but not convincing, evidence for cancer in humans or convincing evidence for cancer in experimental animals, but not both. The findings of limited evidence of carcinogenicity in humans and animals, and of limited mechanistic evidence on how carcinogenicity may occur, underscore the need for more research to refine our understanding on whether consumption of aspartame poses a carcinogenic hazard, said Dr Mary Schubauer-Berigan of the IARC Monographs programme. JECFAs risk assessments determine the probability of a specific type of harm, i.e. cancer, to occur under certain conditions and levels of exposure. It is not unusual for JECFA to factor IARC classifications into its deliberations. JECFA also considered the evidence on cancer risk, in animal and human studies, and concluded that the evidence of an association between aspartame consumption and cancer in humans is not convincing, said Dr Moez Sanaa, WHOs Head of the Standards and Scientific Advice on Food and Nutrition Unit. We need better studies with longer follow-up and repeated dietary questionnaires in existing cohorts. We need randomized controlled trials, including studies of mechanistic pathways relevant to insulin regulation, metabolic syndrome and diabetes, particularly as related to carcinogenicity. The IARC and JECFA evaluations of the impact of aspartame were based on scientific data collected from a range of sources, including peer-reviewed papers, governmental reports and studies conducted for regulatory purposes. The studies have been reviewed by independent experts, and both committees have taken steps to ensure the independence and reliability of their evaluations. IARC and WHO are continuing to monitor new evidence and encourage independent research groups to develop further studies on the potential association between aspartame exposure and consumer health effects.",

        "content": "The Court of Appeal on Friday (July 14) issued an interim order against the Sports Ministers gazette notification suspending the activities of Sri Lanka Rugby (SLR) and its chairman Rizly Illyas. The interim order, issued by the Appeals Court President Nissanka Bandula Karunaratne and Justice A. Marikkar, thereby prevents the implementation of the said gazette notification. A writ application filed by the chairman of the countrys rugby governing body was taken up before the Appeals Court bench this morning. The judges ordered the interim order to be in place until the conclusion of petition hearing. The judge bench said it expects to deliver the verdict of the writ application within three months. Meanwhile, the Sports Minister and other respondents named in the petition were asked to file their objections before July 25. The next hearing of the petition was then fixed for September 06. Meanwhile, Asia Rugby  the regional association of World Rugby  has dismissed the appeal filed by Rizly Illyas challenging the suspension of Sri Lanka Rugby. In a statement published earlier today, the association said the panel appointed in March 2023 to address the appeal filed by the president of the suspended Sri Lankan rugby governing body was dismissed after comprehensive evaluation. Illyas was found guilty on charges of breaching Asia Rugbys Code of Conduct by the Asia Rugby Executive Committee based on a thorough investigation by a Judicial Officer. He was subsequently given the opportunity to appeal, and the appointed appeal panel chaired by the President of Qazakhstan Rugby, Aigul Jartybayeva with the membership of Jeffry Chang, the President of Chinese Taipei Rugby Football Union and David Boyton, Judicial Officer from Hong Kong had dismissed the appeal.",
