        "date": "October 27, 2024 04:32 pm",
        "content": "The last of the Israelis left in a scenic surfing hotspot in Sri Lanka said they felt safe and would stay put despite a warning from the Israeli Government to immediately leave due to the threat of a possible terrorist attack. Israels national security council called on Israelis on Wednesday to get out of tourist areas in the south of the Indian Ocean island nation, saying it had information about a terrorist threat focused on tourist areas and beaches. The agency did not specify the nature of the threat but said the warning pertained to the Arugam Bay area  a popular haunt for Israelis  and beaches in the south and west of the country. The US embassy in Sri Lanka and the German foreign ministry also followed with similar warnings, prompting Colombo to step up security and go on high alert. Sri Lankan police have arrested three suspects for questioning in connection with an unspecified threat. We are working to ensure that all tourists are protected and their safety assured at all times, police spokesman Nihal Thalduwa told Reuters. There were about 600 to 700 Israeli tourists through September to early October in Arugam Bay, local authorities said, but that number had dwindled to just 20 when the security warning was issued this week which came at the tailend of the tourist season. By Friday, 17 had moved out of the area with some of them flying out of the country, leaving behind three Israelis in the south-eastern town of about 7,000 residents. One of them, who has been coming to Sri Lanka since 1991 and is a long-term resident, said he feels safe and is expecting his wife and 17-year-old twin sons to join him in a weeks time. I love coming here and my family loves coming here, and we surf for about three to four hours every day when my sons are here, he told Reuters on Friday after returning home from his morning surfing. I dont think there is a serious security threat. The man, who declined to be identified, said two policemen showed up after the first security warnings. Now, there are 16 security personnel, including police special forces, stationed around his small, blue-painted house in Arugam Bay. Two other Israeli men, brothers who were lounging in their room at a nearby homestay, surrounded by about eight police and special forces personnel, also said they would remain until the end of the month and then relocate to nearby Ahangama town. Sri Lanka has nevertheless beefed up security, with the memory of Easter Sunday bombings of 2019 still fresh. Those attacks blamed on Islamic State targeted churches and three hotels, killing 267 people, including at least 45 foreign nationals. Unprecedented security Checkpoints have sprung up on the main roads and bridges in Arugam Bay and the surrounding area, and as many as 500 police, military and special forces were deployed. Police stopped vehicles and checked identification cards of passengers. Israeli officials have warned of an increase in threats of attacks on Israelis outside their country since the start of the war in Gaza. There has also been a surge in reports of antisemitic incidents in many parts of the world since war broke out in the Middle East after Palestinian Islamist group Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. Arugam Bay residents dismissed social media speculation of tensions in the Muslim-majority town over the presence of Israelis in the wake of the Gaza war. I started renting out rooms to foreigners last year and they are happy to stay here because they are not scared, said Abubakar Rinosha, 41, who owns the homestay of the Israeli brothers. Other residents said Israeli tourists are a major source of income, accounting for 70 of the towns revenue. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "content": "India has handed over solar rooftop systems to religious locations in Sri Lanka in continuation of its the energy partnership in the neighbourhood. In a ceremony held on Friday, representatives from High Commission of India, Ceylon Electricity Board and the Sri Lanka Sustainable Energy Authority handed over the solar panels and other materials to four prominent religious locations in Colombo. These include a Buddhist temple at Hokandara, Sri Aanjaneyar Temple, St. Anthonys Church, and Mutwal Jumma Mosque.

The project aims to generate 25 MW of solar capacity, supplying approximately 37 million units annually, and contribute to Sri Lankas people-centric energy transition. Indias support extends beyond installation, with a five-year maintenance plan to ensure sustained benefits. This effort aligns with Indias Neighbourhood First policy, which emphasizes cooperation on Sri Lankan priorities.

        "content": "One person was killed and dozens were injured on Sunday when a truck struck a bus stop at a major intersection near Tel Aviv in central Israel in what police said they suspected was a terrorist attack. Israeli police said about 40 people were injured to varying degrees, including some seriously, and were taken to nearby hospitals. Ichilov Medical Center in Tel Aviv said one of the victims succumbed to his wounds. Nearly Sheba Medical Center said it treated eight civilians and soldiers. The attack, in which a truck ran into a bus stop close to a military base, took place around 10 am (0800 GMT), police said, noting the driver - who had Israeli citizenship - was neutralised by gunfire from a nearby civilian. All investigative directions are being examined with an emphasis on the suspicion that this is a terror attack, police said. Initial investigations suggest that the truck driver, who was traveling near the Glilot base (north of Tel Aviv) from north to south, veered off course and hit a bus and people waiting at the stop with the truck. Israeli media reported that the attacker was an Israeli Arab from Qalansawe in central Israel. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "date": "October 28, 2024 08:34 am",
        "content": "The make-up of Japans future government was in flux on Monday after voters punished Prime Minister Shigeru Ishibas scandal-tainted ruling coalition, leaving no party with a clear mandate to lead the worlds fourth-largest economy. The uncertainty sent the yen currency to a three-month low as analysts prepared for days, or possibly weeks, of political wrangling to form a government and potentially a change of leader. That comes as the country faces economic headwinds, a tense security situation fuelled by an assertive China and nuclear-armed North Korea, and a week before U.S. voters head to the polls in another unpredictable election. Ishibas Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and its junior coalition partner Komeito took 215 seats in the lower house of parliament, down from 279 seats, as voters punished the incumbents over a funding scandal and a cost-of-living crunch. Two cabinet ministers and Komeitos leader, Keiichi Ishii, lost their seats. The biggest winner of the night, the main opposition Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan (CDPJ), had 148 seats, up from 98 previously, but also still well short of the 233 majority. As mandated by the constitution, the parties now have 30 days to figure out a grouping that can govern, and there remains uncertainty over how long Ishiba - who became premier less than a month ago - can survive after the drubbing. Smaller parties also made gains and their role in negotiations could prove key. Whether or not Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba resigns as LDP leader today, it seems unlikely that he will survive to lead a new government as prime minister ... though it is possible he could stay on as caretaker, said Tobias Harris, founder of Japan Foresight, a political risk advisory firm. Ishiba is scheduled to hold a press conference at 2 p.m. (0500 GMT). Ahead of the election, the LDP had been planning to convene parliament on Nov. 7 to confirm the prime minister, according to Japanese media including Jiji and the Yomiuri newspaper. CDPJ leader Yoshihiko Noda has said he would work with other parties to try and oust the incumbents, though analysts see this as a more remote possibility. The LDP has ruled Japan for almost all of its post-war history and the result marked its worst election since it briefly lost power in 2009 to a precursor of the CDPJ. SCANDAL-TAINTED Ishiba, picked in a close-fought race to lead the LDP late last month, called the snap poll a year before it was due in an effort to secure a public mandate. His initial ratings suggested he may be able to capitalise on his personal popularity, but like his predecessor Fumio Kishida he was undone by resentment over his handling of a scandal involving unrecorded donations to LDP lawmakers. Ishibas LDP declined to endorse several scandal-tainted candidates in the election. But days before the vote, a newspaper affiliated with the Japan Communist Party reported that the party had provided campaign funds to branches headed by non-endorsed candidates. The story was picked up widely by Japanese media despite Ishiba saying the money could not be used by non-endorsed candidates. LDPs payments to branches show utter lack of care for public image, ran an editorial in the influential Asahi newspaper two days before the election. Support from smaller parties, such as the Democratic Party for the People (DPP) or the Japan Innovation Party, who won 28 and 38 seats respectively, could now be key for the LDP. DPP chief Yuichiro Tamaki has not ruled out some cooperation with the LDP-led coalition, but Innovation Party head Nobuyuki Baba has rejected the idea. Both propose policies that could be challenging for the LDP and the Bank of Japan. The DPP calls for halving Japans 10 sales tax until real wages rise, a policy not endorsed by the LDP, while both parties have criticised the BOJs efforts to raise interest rates and wean Japan off decades of monetary stimulus. Its up to what can they give to these two parties to try and get them to just kind of join their side. The best scenario is getting them into the coalition government, but thats a tall order, said Rintaro Nishimura, an associate at consultancy The Asia Group. In a statement, the head of Japans most powerful business lobby Keidanren, Masakazu Tokura, said he hoped for a stable government centred on the LDP-Komeito coalition to steer an economy that faced urgent tasks such as boosting energy security and maintaining the momentum for wage hikes. In one bright spot, a record 73 women were elected into Japans male-dominated parliament, surpassing 54 set at the 2009 election. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

Highlighting the growing public disillusionment with politics, he labeled the current political landscape as tainted by unethical practices. Addressing a public rally held in Kalutara, the President said: We have a lot of work to do. First, we need to change the politics of our country if we are to rebuild it. For too long, politics here has been treated as a business. What we see in Parliament often resembles a spectaclemembers jumping around, wielding chili powder, bringing knives, and engaging in disruptive behavior on the chamber floor. He further criticized the shielding of lawmakers from accountability, referencing a recent no confidence motion against the former health minister over allegations of medicine theft. He described a Parliament populated by lawbreakers and extortionists, stating that the political environment has become unpleasant and corrupt. President Dissanayake declared that November 14 will mark a significant Shramadhanaa national act of cleaningfocused on the Parliament.

Alwis. Retired High Court Judge Alwis had chaired an investigative committee appointed to probe the 2019 Easter Sunday attacks in Sri Lanka. Gammanpila questioned the credibility of the accusations made by Minister Herath, calling for transparency in the discourse surrounding the retired judge. He asserted, Anyone can make accusations, but if an accusation is made, it must be proven with evidence. Thats why I challenged Minister Vijitha Herath to present evidence of Judge Alwiss alleged misconduct at the next government press conference. He further criticized the governments stance on the committees findings, highlighting a lack of response to the Pivithuru Hela Urumayas concerns regarding the Alwis committee report. The government, especially its media spokesperson, has yet to address the specific content of the Alwis committee report, which we made public on the 21 October. Instead, they focus on discrediting committee members, Gammanpila added. Gammanpila further stated: Minister Vijitha Herath has been accused of drunk driving, and questions have been raised about a significant building project in Narahenpita. Who cant make accusations? But they require proof. With another Cabinet press conference scheduled for tomorrow, Gammanpila urged journalists to question Minister Herath for clarity on the evidence supporting these claims. He alleged that dismissing the committees findings by tarnishing its members reputations has become the policy and practice of the government.",

Chung said she is proud of the U.S. Embassys ongoing collaboration with the government of Sri Lanka to respond to a security threat that resulted in its recent security alert, and pledged to continue working together to support the safety and prosperity of Sri Lankas citizens and visitors alike. Speaking during an event on Monday (28), she stated that one of her duties as a US Ambassador is to ensure the safety and the security of American citizens here in Sri Lanka. Globally, all around the world our US Embassies operate under whats called a duty to warn. If we become aware of a credible, specific security threat, we are required to share that information with our staff, US citizens and the host government, Chung stated. She stated that their no double standard policy also means that anytime they alert embassy staff about a specific security concern, they are required to inform US citizens as well. This approach is also standard practice worldwide. When we became aware of a specific threat in the Arugam Bay area we shared these known details with Sri Lankan authorities, who responded quickly. We continue to actively coordinate with them on a daily basis and we value our partnership with Sri Lankas leadership and security officials whose commitment to safety and transparency is notable, she further said. The U.S. Ambassador emphasized that she also wanted to correct some misinformation being spread. There is no travel ban on Sri Lanka. Our security alert last week is for Americans to avoid Arugam Bay until further notice. But our overall travel advisory for Sri Lanka remains exactly the same at Level 2, which has been so for many years. She pointed out that this is similar to advisories of many other popular destinations including the Maldives, France and Italy which are all the same at Level 2. Sri Lanka remains at Level 2, she said. We know that continued safety and stability are essential for a thriving tourism sector which we support absolutely. So, we are fully committed to supporting Sri Lankas efforts to create that secure welcoming environment for all, Ambassador Chung added.",

        "date": "October 28, 2024 03:30 pm",
        "content": "Japanese-produced whisky, nihonshu (sake), and beer are popular around the world. But one bar in Tokyo has been trying to reintroduce to locals and visitors alike a taste of doburoku, one of the oldest and most controversial drinks in Japanese history. Heiwa Doburoku Kabutocho Brewery is in the Nihombashi neighborhood in eastern Tokyo. During the Edo period (1603 - 1868), this area flourished with activity due to boats carrying shipments of sake. With that in mind, Heiwa Shuzou (Brewery), which since 1928 had been producing sake in Wakayama prefecture, chose to open this rare doburoku specialty bar in one of the citys upscale neighborhoods. Before venturing into the bar to try a glass, heres what to know about this historic, controversial tipple. What exactly is doburoku? The history of doburoku is as murky as the drink itself. Often considered to be the ancestor of todays sake; it is no coincidence that the characters comprising the word, 濁酒, signify cloudy, or unrefined, liquor. To distinguish this type of turbid Japanese alcohol from that of the ubiquitous and transparent sake, there are two distinct if slightly misleading categories: seishu (清酒), or clear sake, and doburoku (濁酒). Consequently, sake and doburoku have one key difference in their respective productions. Typical sake calls for a yeast starter, called shubo, and adding three main ingredients steamed rice, kouji (moldy rice fungus) and water  over a period of days. However, when making doburoku, they are all simultaneously placed in with the yeast starter, causing the resulting mixture to be comparatively overflowing with sugars. The sugars then start to break down the yeast, which halts fermentation much earlier on. Ultimately, what remains is a sweeter liquid with a much lower alcohol content, formally known as doburoku. Why has doburoku been considered controversial? For nearly as long as rice has been cultivated in Japan, doburoku has existed. It was the brew of choice for farmers and Shinto priests alike. With a relatively simple recipe  i.e. throwing everything into the proverbial crucible at once  doburoku was a common sight throughout the countryside. The open practice of homebrewing continued unabated for centuries. According to Utsunomiya Hitoshi, director of the Japan Sake and Shochu Makers Association (JSS), in 1855 there were 459 doburoku producers in Edo (present-day Tokyo) alone. Yet, as a result of the end of the Edo period (1603 CE - 1868 CE), all feudal lords were forced to abandon their regional domains in the name of the centralized Meiji government, based out of the new capital Tokyo. Borne out of the 180-degree shift in governance came highly structured institutions, including an empowered and regimented tax collecting body. Realizing that licensed breweries and distilleries were a vital source of income for the new government, measures to limit homebrewing began to take effect. Utsunomiya says that 1880 is when the quantity of homebrewed liquor started to be restricted, while in 1882 a licensing system was introduced. Then, in 1896, a liquor tax was imposed on all homebrewing, culminating in the complete prohibition of homebrewed liquors in 1899. In essence, all doburoku made from then on came to be called mitsuzoushu (密造酒), secretly produced alcohol, or moonshine. However, even during that prohibition, doburoku could still be found in Japan. Tellingly, Shinto shrines were able to carry on using the beverage for rituals. After World War II, due to a shortage of sake, the Korean beverage makgeolli, an unfiltered cousin of doburoku made of rice, wheat, malt and water, was a popular alternative. In spite of the fact that homebrewing is still illegal, the Japanese government allowed for inns and restaurants in special deregulation zones, primarily in regions where economic growth had stagnated, to commercially sell doburoku in 2003. As of 2021, there are 193 establishments around the country authorized to sell doburoku. The state of doburoku today Opened in 2015, Tokyos Sake Hotaru was the first legal spot to offer doburoku in Japans capital. But bar owners only started selling it to the public in late 2016. Since then, more options have appeared. Most prominently, in June 2022, the previously mentioned Heiwa Doburoku Kabutocho Brewery opened a bar near Nihombashi. Norimasa Yamamoto, President of Heiwa Shuzo, estimates that half the bars visitors are from overseas. We often receive questions about the difference between sake and doburoku, how many days it takes to make it, and how its produced, he says of the bar patrons. In addition to doburoku, the brewerys own sake and beer labels are available. However, keep in mind that if you want to order anything, the brewery does not accept cash. The flavor is intense, with samplers comparing it to both cheddar cheese and noni, a unique-tasting Polynesian fruit. And travelers unable to make it to Japan can sample doboruku closer to home. In Brooklyn, Kato Sake Works sells small amounts of the drink. However, owner Shinobu Kato says the context doesnt exist here, as Americans are less likely to have heard of doboruku. Apart from a few sake shops that are very familiar with and interested in our doburoku, Kato says, most of the sales are at the taproom for both bottle to go and drink by the glass.

        "date": "October 28, 2024 03:37 pm",
        "content": "Trump Media  Technology Group is losing money, generating very little revenue and its main product Truth Social remains a relatively small player in social media. And yet Wall Street is valuing former President Donald Trumps social media company at nearly 8 billion, a price tag that has tripled in the span of just five weeks. Since plunging to record lows on September 23, Trump Medias share price has skyrocketed. Market veterans say this monster comeback is being almost entirely driven by bets that Trump will win the White House. Trump Media is not a normal stock. Its basically a meme stock, meaning that it trades not on fundamentals but on hype and momentum linked to the Republican nominees political fortunes. The stock is essentially a proxy for how traders think the election will turn out. Ive never seen anything quite like this. This companys value is almost entirely based on the outcome of an election, Gene Munster, managing partner and co-founder of venture capital firm Deepwater Asset Management, told CNN in a phone interview. A binary outcome Munster said there is nothing about Trump Medias fundamentals that can justify its nearly 8 billion market value. The companys second-quarter revenue amounted to just 837,000, a tiny amount normally associated with a company valued in the millions, not billions, of dollars. And yet Trump Medias share price has surged more than 200 since September 23. It sounds crazy but that move, to me, is justified because its a binary outcome, Munster said. Its pretty straightforward: If Trump wins the election, its going to be worth more than the 8 billion its currently worth. And if he loses, it will be worth significantly less. Trump is the dominant shareholder in the company that bears his name. His stake of 114.75 million shares is now worth about 4.5 billion, up from 1.4 billion on September 23. The fact that Trump has pledged not to sell his shares  and that he has not disclosed any stock sales  has helped boost the share price. Crazy valuation George Kailas, CEO of Prospero.ai, a research platform that helps retail traders get better market intelligence, told CNN that Trump Media is trading like a classic meme stock. Social sentiment takes off, hitting a fever pitch, raising the value of the stock and then people keep betting on it more and more, Kailas said. But Kailas said the massive rally in Trump Media means it is now trading at more than 1,600 times its enterprise value (a measure of a companys total value, including debt and cash). He described that valuation ratio as crazy, noting that other hot stocks are trading at just a fraction of that. Were seeing people wagering with their hearts, Kailas said. Theres not a good story about how they are going to justify that valuation. The polls indicate the race for the White House remains incredibly close. Trump Medias share price saw a sharp decline in July after President Joe Biden ended his reelection bid. Polls at the time suggested Trump faced an uphill battle to defeat Democratic nominee Vice President Kamala Harris. But now Trump and Harris are locked in a dead heat in the latest national polls. There is a case to be made that if Trump wins the election, the companys prospects increase dramatically, said Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers. If Trump returns to the White House, Sosnick said Truth Social could become an important platform for presidential communications. The market is saying this will be a proprietary platform for the most influential person in the world  and there is some value to that that they will find ways to monetize, said Munster. More turbulence ahead Trump Medias already-volatile share price could experience more turbulence in the days and weeks ahead. Munster anticipates Trump Media could keep rallying into the election and then perhaps retreat a bit if he wins in a classic buy-on-the rumor, sell-on-the-news type move. Analysts say a Trump loss could set off a steep selloff. It will free fall, said Munster. If he loses, I suspect its a billion-dollar company. Sosnick agrees that Trump Media would give back most of its gains if the election doesnt go in Trumps favor. If hes not elected, what are you left with? A company thats a few years old, modest revenue and essentially no profits, he said. If this were called Joes Media Company, we wouldnt even be talking about it and it wouldnt have a value anywhere close to this. The value is completely tied to the former president.

        "date": "October 28, 2024 04:02 pm",
        "content": "The equal distribution of seats between the National Peoples Power (NPP) and opposition parties will have no effect on maintaining the activities of the Elpitiya Pradeshiya Sabha, according to former Election Commission Chairman Mahinda Deshapriya. The NPP had secured 15 seats while the remaining 15 seats were divided among the various opposition groups. Nishantha Perera, who contested as the NPP Group Leader, is tipped to be appointed as the new Chairman of the Elpitiya Pradeshiya Sabha. The election for the local council was held last Saturday (26), under a combination of the constituency level and the proportional representation system. In the 30-seat council, the NPP emerged as the leading party with 15 seats. The Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) secured six seats, the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) obtained three seats, the Peoples Alliance won two seats, and an Independent Group also secured two seats. Additionally, the Peoples United Freedom Alliance and the Peoples Party each won one seat. Mahinda Deshapriya addressed concerns about the NPPs ability to govern the council effectively under these circumstances. He clarified that the ordinance related to local government elections explicitly allows a party with 50 of the council seats to appoint the chairman. There is no problem with the establishment of the Elpitiya Pradeshiya Sabha. There is a misconception that a tie in votes would necessitate a separate poll for the chairman. However, the ordinance clearly states that if a party has obtained 50 of the members of a local government body, they have the right to appoint the chairman, Deshapriya explained. He further mentioned that the Election Commission will write to the NPPs secretary, who will then submit the names of the chairman and vice-chairman. In case of a tie in votes on any proposal, the chairman has the decisive vote to ensure the smooth operation of the council. Thus, Deshapriya emphasized that there will be no problem in managing the councils activities.",

Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi on Sunday proposed a two-day truce in Gaza and limited hostage exchange aimed at securing a complete ceasefire after more than a year of war between Israel and Hamas. The proposal includes exchanging four Israeli hostages held in Gaza for Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails, and would be followed by more negotiations within 10 days, Sisi said at a news conference in Cairo.

Sisis intervention came with Israel continuing to pound the Palestinian territory while also fighting a war against Hezbollah in Lebanon and having just launched air strikes on its major foe Iran. The strikes on Saturday, the second time Israel has retaliated against Iranian ballistic missile attacks, triggered global calls for restraint. The UN Security Council will meet on Monday at Irans request, with Tehran calling for the body to condemn the strikes that killed four soldiers. At home, Iranian leaders played down their importance, saying the strikes had caused only limited damage. President Masoud Pezeshkian told his cabinet Iran did not want war but would deliver an appropriate response. According to Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, Tehran had received indications hours before the attack. US news site Axios reported earlier that Israel had provided a warning so as to prevent a wider escalation. Israel launched the strikes in retaliation for an October 1 missile attack by Iran, which was a response to the killings of Tehran-aligned militant leaders and an Iranian commander. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the operation was precise and powerful, achieving all of its objectives. Netanyahu, speaking at a memorial event in Jerusalem for Hamass October 7 attack that sparked the war, was interrupted by shouting from relatives of victims in the crowd. There has been public and diplomatic pressure on Netanyahu to do more to strike a deal to secure the release of the remaining captives held in Gaza. Egypt, alongside Qatar and the United States, has for months been mediating indirect talks with little success. Israeli spy chief David Barnea was due in Qatar on Sunday for talks aimed at restarting negotiations towards a hostage deal. Families of the hostages have called on the Israeli government to broker an agreement in the wake of the killing of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar earlier this month. Israeli and US officials as well as some analysts said Sinwar had been a key obstacle to a deal. Among the key issues preventing a breakthrough in talks has been Hamass insistence that Israel withdraw completely from Gaza, which Israeli officials have repeatedly rejected. Earlier on Sunday, Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said painful concessions would be needed in negotiations and that military action alone would not achieve the countrys war aims. Out of 251 hostages seized by Palestinian militants during the October 7 attack, 97 are still held in Gaza including 34 the Israeli military says are dead. More than 100 were released during a one-week truce last November. Against the already charged backdrop, a truck crashed into a crowd of people near a central Israel intelligence complex, killing one man and injuring more than two dozen people. Israel continued to fight in Gaza and Lebanon, where strikes hit Beirut and multiple southern cities. The Lebanese health ministry said at least 21 people were killed in Israeli strikes on south Lebanon on Sunday, including at least nine near Sidon city and seven - three of them rescuers - in the southern village of Ain Baal, closer to the Israeli border. The war has left at least 1,615 people dead in Lebanon since September 23, according to an Agence France-Presse tally based on official figures, though the real number is likely to be higher due to gaps in the data. The Israeli military said early on Sunday it had killed 70 Hezbollah fighters while losing five of its own soldiers in fighting, taking to 37 the death toll among troops since the start of ground operations in Lebanon late last month. Heavy bombing also continued in Gaza. The Israeli military said it had killed another 40 militants in the territory. United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres expressed deep concern for the fate of Gazas civilians, weeks into a major Israeli operation in the territorys north. The plight of Palestinian civilians trapped in north Gaza is unbearable, Guterres spokesman said. On the ground, resident Bilal al-Hajri said: We are really dying under a tight siege and famine. None of us can leave home even to provide some food and drink, said the Palestinian man. Anyone who leaves is targeted. Speaking in Cairo, Sisi warned of famine and said it was very important that aid enters as soon as possible. With the sweeping assault ongoing, Gazas civil defence agency said on Sunday an Israeli strike on a school building sheltering displaced Palestinians killed at least nine people. The Israeli military said it was looking into the report. Israel launched the offensive in Gaza a year ago after Hamas October 7 attack that resulted in the deaths of 1,206 people, mostly civilians, according to an Agence France-Presse tally of official Israeli figures. At least 42,924 Palestinians, a majority of them civilians, have been killed in the Israeli offensive on Gaza, according to figures from the Hamas-ruled territorys health ministry, which the UN considers reliable. The war has since drawn in Iran-backed groups across the region, most notably Hezbollah in Lebanon, but also militias in Iraq, Syria and Yemen. Source: AFP --Agencies",

        "content": "President Anura Kumara Dissanayake has emphasized the importance of implementing a procurement plan and strengthening the National Procurement Commission (NPC). The President shared these views in a meeting held at the Presidential Secretariat this morning (28), where he engaged in an in-depth discussion with NPC officials on the current procurement laws and procedures, the Presidents Media Division (PMD) said in a statement. Officials from the National Procurement Commission informed the President that although around 60 of all government expenditures, including capital expenses, should ideally follow a proper procurement process, shortcomings in this process are causing significant losses to the government. This, they noted, creates greater opportunities for fraud and corruption, the statement added. The discussion also covered issues related to delays, lack of transparency, and inefficiencies in the procurement process. Attention was given to minimizing shortcomings in handling unsolicited proposals and Public-Private Partnership (PPP) procurements. President Dissanayake pointed out the need to further expand the authority of the NPC to establish more systematic procurement planning, according to the PMD. The meeting was attended by Secretary to the Presidential Dr. Nandika Sanath Kumanayake, NPC Chairperson Sudharma Karunaratne, and other officials from the National Procurement Commission.",

        "date": "October 28, 2024 06:01 pm",
        "content": "The Director of the Western Province Animal Production and Health Department K.K. Sarath said that African swine fever, which was initially reported for the first time in the Western Province, has now also been detected in Uva, Northern and North Western provinces. While joining the Ada Derana BIG FOCUS program, he emphasized that the disease has a very high mortality rate in infected animals, and noted that there is currently no available treatment. Sarath also said that African swine fever has been reported in 04 farms in the Western Province with affected animals identified in the Divisional Secretariats of Beruwala, Welisara and Padukka. According to the data reported last week, there are about 70,000 pigs in the Western Province with 20,000 to 25,000 of them having succumbed to the disease. The Western Province Director of the Animal Production and Health Department who commented on the measures taken to control the African swine Disease said, If we take the plan to control this disease, one thing is to detect the disease. We need to seal all those animals and stop the virus from spreading. We have to create a pocket. It will take some time. He further commented stating that as per the guidelines, the infected animals need to be put down, similar to practices in other countries. But given Sri Lankas economic situation, it creates a problem, especially if animals are to be put down, compensation should be paid, which raises questions about the required funding. The Western Provincial Director of the Animal Production and Health Department said that the government is expected to release a relevant Gazette notification today (28) detailing the necessary measures to manage the disease. There have been reports of dead wild boars in the Mirigama area. We still dont know why they died. The local residents said that theres an unusually high number of deaths among animals in the area. Furthermore, yesterday (27), the department confirmed that the reproductive and respiratory disease previously reported in pigs from the Gampaha District was African swine fever. Accordingly, it has been confirmed it to be African Swine Disease from some of the new samples taken from the field. Recently, incidents of sudden death of pigs were reported in several areas of Gampaha District and the Department of Animal Production and Health conducted a special investigation in this regard.",

        "date": "October 29, 2024 10:14 am",
        "content": "Israels parliament has voted to pass legislation banning the UNs Palestinian refugee agency (Unrwa) from operating within Israel and Israeli-occupied East Jerusalem, within three months. Contact between Unrwa employees and Israeli officials will also be banned, severely limiting the agencys ability to operate in Gaza and the Israeli-occupied West Bank. Co-operation with the Israeli military - which controls all crossings into Gaza - is essential for Unrwa to transfer aid into the war-torn territory. It is the main UN organisation working on the ground there. Unrwa staff will no longer have legal immunity within Israel, and the agencys headquarters in East Jerusalem will be closed. UN Secretary General António Guterres said implementing the laws would be detrimental for the resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and for peace and security in the region as a whole, while Unrwas chief Philippe Lazzarini said it will only deepen the suffering of Palestinians. A number of countries, including the US, the UK and Germany, have expressed serious concern about the move. UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy called it totally wrong, while Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said the laws risk making Unrwas essential work for Palestinians impossible, jeopardising the entire international humanitarian response in Gaza. The US State Department said Unrwa played a critical role in distributing humanitarian aid in the Gaza Strip. Almost all of the enclaves population of more than two million people are dependent on aid and services from the agency. Israels Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that Unrwa workers involved in terrorist activities against Israel must be held accountable, but added that sustained humanitarian aid must remain available in Gaza. We stand ready to work with our international partners to ensure Israel continues to facilitate humanitarian aid to civilians in Gaza in a way that does not threaten Israels security, he said on X. Israel has objected to Unrwa for decades, although this opposition has intensified in recent years. Israel says Unrwa staff have colluded with Hamas in Gaza, and claimed 19 Unrwa workers took part in the Hamas attacks of 7 October 2023. The UN investigated Israels claim and fired nine of those accused, but it said Israel had not provided evidence for broader allegations. Unrwa insists that dealings with Hamas are purely to enable the agency to do its job. Israels parliament, the Knesset, approved the two bills by an overwhelming majority on Monday evening. Presenting the legislation, Yuli Edelstein, the chairman of the Knessets foreign affairs and security committee, accused Unrwa of being used as a cover for terrorist actions. There is a deep connection between the terrorist organisation (Hamas) and Unrwa, and Israel cannot put up with it, he said in parliament. Unrwa - the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees - has for decades provided a range of services and support including healthcare and education to millions of Palestinians in Gaza. Since the war broke out last year, the agencys presence on the ground has made it a crucial part of efforts to get humanitarian supplies to civilians, almost all of whom are dependent on aid for survival. Unrwa Commissioner-General Philippe Lazzarini condemned the ban as unprecedented, and said it opposes the UN Charter and violates the State of Israels obligations under international law. He said people in Gaza had already endured sheer hell, adding: It will deprive over 650,000 girls and boys there from education, putting at risk an entire generation of children. About two-and-half million Palestinians are registered with Unrwa in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and the Gaza Strip. In northern Gaza, where Israeli troops are conducting military operations against Hamas fighters, hundreds of thousands of people are living in increasingly desperate conditions. UN human rights chief Volker Türk said on Friday that the Israeli military is subjecting an entire population to bombing, siege and risk of starvation. Many Palestinians believe the Israeli military is implementing a surrender or starve plan in Gazas north, which would see the forced displacement of all of the estimated 400,000 civilians there to the south, followed by a siege of any remaining Hamas fighters. The Israeli military has denied having such a plan and says it is making sure that civilians get out of harms way. Israel launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to its 7 October attack on Israel, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. More than 42,710 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territorys Hamas-run health ministry. Source: BBC --Agencies",

        "content": "Lebanese armed group Hezbollah said on Tuesday it had elected deputy head Naim Qassem to succeed slain secretary general Hassan Nasrallah, who was killed in an Israeli air attack on Beiruts southern suburb over a month ago. The group said in a written statement that its Shura Council had elected Qassem, 71, in accordance with its established mechanism for choosing a secretary general. He was appointed as Hezbollahs deputy chief in 1991 by the armed groups then-secretary general Abbas al-Musawi, who was killed by an Israeli helicopter attack the following year. Qassem remained in his role when Nasrallah became leader, and has long been one of Hezbollahs leading spokesmen, conducting interviews with foreign media, including as cross-border hostilities with Israel raged over the last year. Nasrallah was killed on Sept. 27, and senior Hezbollah figure Hashem Safieddine - considered the most likely successor - was killed in Israeli strikes a week later. Since Nasrallahs killing, Qassem has given three televised addresses, including one on Oct. 8 in which he said the armed group supported efforts to reach a ceasefire for Lebanon.

On October 23, Israels national Security Council had issued an urgent warning to Israeli citizens to leave popular tourist areas in southern Sri Lanka immediately, and classified the Arugam Bay region as a level four threat, advising Israelis to take precautions, such as concealing their Jewish identity and avoiding large gatherings. It also advised Israelis in other parts of Sri Lanka to exercise caution and avoid holding large public gatherings. The Russian Embassy and the UK issued a similar warnings to its citizens, urging them to remain vigilant and avoid large gatherings.

        "date": "October 29, 2024 04:04 pm",
        "content": "The Sri Lanka Computer Emergency Readiness Team (SL CERT) today issued an alert to the public about the surge in fake messages being disseminated via social media and communication platforms, particularly WhatsApp. These deceptive messages are designed to fraudulently obtain personal and financial information by impersonating credible institutions, including banks, commercial organizations, and international bodies, according to the SL CERT. Recent observations by Sri Lanka CERT indicate that cybercriminals are using social media platforms, fake websites, SMS, and even postal services to reach potential victims. In many cases, these messages falsely promise donations, monetary rewards, high-value products, or services and request sensitive information, including One-Time Passwords (OTPs). By interacting with these fraudulent messages or clicking on embedded links, individuals risk exposing their personal data to criminal misuse, including financial fraud and identity theft, it added. Accordingly, Sri Lanka CERT alerts users about the risks of sharing One-Time Passwords (OTPs) requested through WhatsApp, as this may unintentionally grant malicious intruders access to their accounts. Such access can then be misused to solicit further support or sensitive information from contacts. The organization has noted a concerning rise in these crimes and an increase in victims across the country. Users are urged to exercise caution and verify any requests for OTPs or sensitive information, even if they seem to come from trusted sources. The public is urged to exercise caution when sharing personal information during online transactions and to question the necessity of data requests. Additionally, Sri Lanka CERT advises verifying the authenticity of messages received on social media and communication networks by consulting official websites, contacting institutions directly, or checking through verified phone numbers before responding.",

        "title": "Lost Mayan city found in Mexico jungle by accident",
        "date": "October 29, 2024 04:23 pm",
        "content": "A huge Maya city has been discovered centuries after it disappeared under jungle canopy in Mexico. Archaeologists found pyramids, sports fields, causeways connecting districts and amphitheatres in the southeastern state of Campeche. They uncovered the hidden complex - which they have called Valeriana - using Lidar, a type of laser survey that maps structures buried under vegetation. They believe it is second in density only to Calakmul, thought to be the largest Maya site in ancient Latin America. The team discovered three sites in total, which are the size of Scotlands capital Edinburgh, by accident when one archaeologist browsed data on the internet. I was on something like page 16 of Google search and found a laser survey done by a Mexican organisation for environmental monitoring, explains Luke Auld-Thomas, a PhD student at Tulane university in the US. It was a Lidar survey, a remote sensing technique which fires thousands of laser pulses from a plane and maps objects below using the time the signal takes to return. But when Mr Auld-Thomas processed the data with methods used by archaeologists, he saw what others had missed - a huge ancient city which may have been home to 30-50,000 people at its peak from 750 to 850 AD. That is more than the number of people who live in the region today, the researchers say. Mr Auld-Thomas and his colleagues named the city Valeriana after a nearby lagoon. The find helps change an idea in Western thinking that the Tropics was where civilisations went to die, says Professor Marcello Canuto, a co-author in the research. Instead, this part of the world was home to rich and complex cultures, he explains. We cant be sure what led to the demise and eventual abandonment of the city, but the archaeologists say climate change was a major factor. Valeriana has the hallmarks of a capital city and was second only in density of buildings to the spectacular Calakmul site, around 100km away (62 miles). It is hidden in plain sight, the archaeologists say, as it is just 15 minutes hike from a major road near Xpujil where mostly Maya people now live. There are no known pictures of the lost city because no-one has ever been there, the researchers say, although local people may have suspected there were ruins under the mounds of earth. The city, which was about 16.6 sq km, had two major centres with large buildings around 2km (1.2 miles) apart, linked by dense houses and causeways. It has two plazas with temple pyramids, where Maya people would have worshipped, hidden treasures like jade masks and buried their dead. It also had a court where people would have played an ancient ball game. There was also evidence of a reservoir, indicating that people used the landscape to support a large population. In total, Mr Auld-Thomas and Prof Canuto surveyed three different sites in the jungle. They found 6,764 buildings of various sizes. Professor Elizabeth Graham from University College London, who was not involved in the research, says it supports claims that Maya lived in complex cities or towns, not in isolated villages. The point is that the landscape is definitely settled - that is, settled in the past - and not, as it appears to the naked eye, uninhabited or wild, she says. The research suggests that when Maya civilisations collapsed from 800AD onwards, it was partly because they were so densely populated and could not survive climate problems. Its suggesting that the landscape was just completely full of people at the onset of drought conditions and it didnt have a lot of flexibility left. And so maybe the entire system basically unravelled as people moved farther away, says Mr Auld-Thomas. Warfare and the conquest of the region by Spanish invaders in the 16th century also contributed to eradication of Maya city states. Many more cities could be found Lidar technology has revolutionised how archaeologists survey areas covered in vegetation, like the Tropics, opening up a world of lost civilisations, explains Prof Canuto. In the early years of his career, surveys were done by foot and hand, using simple instruments to check the ground inch by inch. But in the decade since Lidar was used in the Mesoamerican region, he says its mapped around 10 times the area that archaeologists managed in about a century of work. Mr Auld-Thomas says his work suggests there are many sites out there that archaeologists have no idea about. In fact so many sites have been found that researchers cannot hope to excavate them all. Ive got to go to Valeriana at some point. Its so close to the road, how could you not? But I cant say we will do a project there, says Mr Auld-Thomas. One of the downsides of discovering lots of new Maya cities in the era of Lidar is that there are more of them than we can ever hope to study, he adds. Source: BBC --Agencies",

Canadian Deputy Foreign Affairs Minister David Morrison said to a parliamentary panel on Tuesday that he told the U.S.-based newspaper that Shah was behind the plots. The journalist called me and asked if it (Shah) was that person. I confirmed it was that person, Morrison told the committee, without providing further details or evidence. The High Commission of India in Ottawa and the Indian foreign ministry had no immediate comment. India has called Sikh separatists terrorists and threats to its security. Sikh separatists demand an independent homeland known as Khalistan to be carved out of India. An insurgency in India during the 1980s and 1990s killed tens of thousands. That period included the 1984 anti-Sikh riots that left thousands dead following the assassination of then-Prime Minister Indira Gandhi by her Sikh bodyguards after she ordered security forces to storm the holiest Sikh temple to flush out Sikh separatists. Canada in mid-October expelled Indian diplomats, linking them to the 2023 murder of Sikh separatist leader Hardeep Singh Nijjar on Canadian soil. India also ordered the expulsion of Canadian diplomats. The Canadian case is not the only instance of Indias alleged targeting of Sikh separatists on foreign soil. Washington has charged a former Indian intelligence officer, Vikash Yadav, for allegedly directing a foiled plot to murder Sikh separatist leader Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, a dual U.S.-Canadian citizen and Indian critic in New York City. The FBI warned against such a retaliation aimed at a U.S. resident. India has said little publicly since announcing in November 2023 it would formally investigate the U.S. allegations. The accusations have tested Washington and Ottawas relations with India, often viewed by the West as a counterbalance to China. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "content": "The Commissioner General of Examinations Amith Jayasundara urges students appearing for the 2024 Advanced Level examination to download the official schedule exclusively from the Examination Departments website. Speaking at a special press conference held today (30), Jayasundara confirmed that all preparations are complete to conduct the AL examination from November 25 to December 20, 2024, as scheduled, with no postponement. Jayasundara noted that the examination dates were determined in March of this year. However, he raised concerns about misinformation circulating on social media, which has created uncertainty among students regarding the exam schedule. The Exams Commissioner General emphasized that the students should rely solely on announcements from the Examination Department, advising candidates not to be misled by social media advertisements or other unofficial sources. The Commissioner General added that the exam admission cards will be issued to candidates shortly. He also acknowledged that both he and the department have received multiple requests to postpone the exams, largely due to challenges posed by the countrys ongoing crises. However, Jayasundara said that the dates of the AL examination were decided paying attention to the total time period required for covering all the subjects, adding that over recent years, national examinations have faced scheduling irregularities, a situation he hopes will stabilize by late 2025 or early 2026.",

        "date": "October 30, 2024 11:32 am",
        "content": "The Chairman of the Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment (SLBFE) Kosala Wickramasinghe disclosed that the E-8 visa agreement with South Korea was signed unlawfully by the former minister, without obtaining Cabinet approval or proper government authorization. In a recent statement, Wickramasinghe emphasized that no private employment agencies in Sri Lanka are permitted to send workers to South Korea under the E-8 visa system, nor to collect any fees associated with it. He highlighted significant public misconceptions surrounding the E-8 visa, noting that it is a short-term visa limited to five months, which poses potential risks and lacks sufficient government oversight. There is currently a debate around the E-8 visa system in Sri Lanka. These visas are only available for a five-month period, which could lead to various issues. This is why no government has sanctioned agreements under this category. No private agencies in Sri Lanka are authorized to send workers to Korea or collect money for this purpose, he stated. Wickramasinghe further explained that the former minister had independently pursued the E-8 visa arrangement with a provincial governor in South Koreas Wando Province, bypassing the required governmental approvals. The Foreign Employment Bureau, he added, cannot be held responsible for this unauthorized arrangement, which was not sanctioned by the South Korean government. He stated that upon learning of this agreement, South Korean authorities expressed concerns and have urged Sri Lanka not to facilitate worker placements under the E-8 visa. Reaffirming the bureaus commitment to the legal E-9 visa, Wickramasinghe stated, The E-9 visa, which offers placements for four years and ten months, remains the proper and stable route for Sri Lankan workers in Korea. By the end of this year, we anticipate sending more than 7,000 individuals under this legal system, which ensures substantial income and job security. We strongly advise job seekers against paying for opportunities tied to the unauthorized E-8 visa, he further added.",

        "date": "October 30, 2024 12:04 pm",
        "content": "Apple is expected to report its biggest quarterly revenue jump in two years on Thursday, with iPhone demand faring better than recent years toward the end of the companys annual release cycle, especially in China. The results will provide investors the first hints of demand for the latest iPhone 16 series, which was released a few days before the end of the companys fiscal fourth quarter. But the focus will be on executive commentary for its fiscal first quarter amid fears that releasing its Apple Intelligence features at a slow pace could dampen a much-awaited AI-led super-cycle for Apples biggest seller. The company is playing catch-up in AI as Android smartphone rivals such as Samsung Electronics and software rivals such as Microsoft aggressively roll out applications aimed at tapping the generative AI boom. The strength of the iPhone 16 cycle is the most important question heading into both the December quarter and FY25, Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi said. Investors should expect Apple to be upbeat about iPhone 16 and Apple Intelligence, but it may or may not necessarily reflect the ultimate success of the cycle. The company on Monday started a limited rollout of the features to U.S. customers in English, weeks after the iPhone 16 went on sale. For now, Apple Intelligence will remain unavailable on iPhones in key markets including Europe and China, where the tech giant is under pressure from a resurgent Huawei, as well as other domestic players such as Vivo, Xiaomi and Honor. Apple rolled out some Apple Intelligence features to European Union users on Mac computers and will launch more of those features in April, the company said this week. The limited rollout has raised worries that customers may push device purchases from the all-important holiday season to next year, delaying a potential boost to sales from AI. In the September quarter, Apple is expected to report a 3.8 increase in iPhone sales, according to analysts estimates compiled by LSEG. That would snap two quarters of decline. Its overall revenue is expected to rise 5.7 in the July-September period, which makes up its fiscal fourth quarter, LSEG data showed. Revenue from Greater China is expected to rise 6.6. Some iPhone models, including a version of the iPhone 16 Plus, had discounts of 10 on online retail platform Pinduoduo ahead of the models official release, according to local reports. Pinduoduo is not an Apple retailer partner, meaning Apple has no control over its prices. Lower iPhone prices, as well as the iPhone 16 series, helped Apple finish with the second-largest share of the Chinese market in the three months to September, according to IDC data. Sales of the iPad are set to rise 10.1 to 7.09 billion after a 23.7 jump in the prior three months, powered by launches of more powerful versions of the tablet. The services business - which includes its App Store and usually outpaces growth in Apples devices - is expected to see a 13.3 rise in sales, a tad slower than the prior quarter. The business faces rising hurdles after European Union antitrust regulators charged Apple with breaching the blocs tech rules in June. Apples lucrative deal with Alphabet that makes Google the default search engine in iOS is also facing scrutiny in the U.S. Its fourth-quarter results will also include a one-time income-tax charge of about 10 billion after Europes top court ruled against Apple in September in its court battle over its tax affairs in Ireland. (This story has been corrected to clarify that some Apple Intelligence features are available on Mac computers in Europe, in paragraph 9, and to add that Pinduoduo is not an official Apple partner, in paragraph 14) Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "content": "Social media activist Ashen Senaratne says that he expects to enter the Parliament through the national list in the upcoming General Election, although his nomination was rejected. Senaratne stated that he recently joined the Independent Group No. 15 in Colombo, while expressing his aspiration to eventually lead the country, stating, one day becoming the President of the country is my last hope. Senaratne became a controversial figure recently when the District Returning Officer rejected his nomination on behalf of an independent group for the Colombo District. Following this setback, he filed a petition with the Supreme Court, challenging the decision to dismiss his nomination. However, the Supreme Court, in a ruling delivered by a three-judge bench comprising Justices Preethi Padman Surasena, Achala Vengappuli, and Priyantha Fernando, upheld the Returning Officers decision. Despite the setback, Senaratne remains hopeful. He explained that while his name may not appear on the ballot, he believes that if Independent Group No. 15 garners significant support in Colombo, he could secure a seat through the national list. Those who truly care for the people stand apart, working independently rather than aligning with corrupt parties, Senaratne added. Furthermore, he expressed: If a man gets older by size, Namal Rajapaksa will not come to the Parliament in his twenties. Ranil Wickramasinghe will not enter politics in his twenties. No one pulled them by the leg, no one hindered their journey. That is why such huge political figures have been born. Dont judge anyone by looks. Measure him by his work...",

        "content": "The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA)-funded Food for Education and Child Nutrition Program (PALAMA II project), implemented by Save the Children, focusing on addressing short-term hunger in schools and improving educational outcomes in vulnerable urban areas in Sri Lanka, expanded into Colombo-area schools this month. This initiative provides daily school meals, trains teachers, promotes literacy, and supports local communities across Sri Lanka to boost school enrollment and academic performance. While the program has existed in seven other provinces across Sri Lanka over the last six years, the expansion into Colombo is new and designed to address the needs of low-income children in urban areas where high dropout rates persist, the US Embassy in Colombo said. The PALAMA II program supplements the National School Meal Program by providing daily meals to 16,231 primary students in 44 schools across Colombo, ensuring that these children have the nutrition they need to learn and thrive. Meanwhile, U.S. Ambassador Julie Chung visited the Buwanekaba Primary School in Maharagama, Colombo today (30) to observe the implementation of USDAs McGovern-Dole International Food for Education and Child Nutrition Program. Ambassador Chung met with students, teachers, parents, and school meal providers who shared how this program is positively impacting childrens health and academic success. Ambassador Chung remarked, I am honored to be here in Maharagama and to experience a morning in your school. From breakfast meals to classroom activities, its heartwarming to see the smiles of eager learners and the dedication of resilient teachers. The United States is proud to support initiatives that not only provide nutritious meals but also create a better learning environment. This investment in Colombos urban schools aims to bring much-needed support to children and communities. By working together, we are investing in these students, empowering them to achieve their dreams and build a brighter future for Sri Lanka, she said. Since 2018, the United States has contributed 60 million to improve child health and education in Sri Lanka through the McGovern-Dole program. This support includes the delivery of over 10,260 metric tons (MT) of U.S.-donated commodities and 1,820 MT of locally produced fortified rice and canned fish to eight districts: Badulla, Colombo, Kilinochchi, Monaragala, Mullaitivu, Nuwara Eliya, Ratnapura, and Trincomalee. Between October 2024 and 2028, the PALAMA II program will reach 199,136 school-age children in 917 primary schools and 23,200 children in 500 Early Childhood Development (ECD) centers across Sri Lanka, prioritizing the most vulnerable communities, the statement said.",

        "content": "The release of a new song by Liam Payne has been postponed after his collaborator said its not the time yet and he wants to let the singers family mourn in peace. The One Direction star, who died two weeks ago, co-wrote and sang on the track Do No Wrong with North Carolina singer Sam Pounds. Pounds had said the song would be released on Friday, 1 November, and he hoped it would eclipses the negative echoes surrounding Paynes death. But, in a statement on Tuesday, Pounds said he was deciding to hold Do No Wrong and leave those liberties up to all family members. He added: I want all proceeds go to a charity of their choosing (or however they desire). Even though we all love the song its not the time yet. We are all still mourning the passing of Liam and I want the family to mourn in peace and in prayer. We will all wait. Fans thanked Pounds for delaying the songs full release, with one saying it was the right decision while another said there will be a right time for it in the future but for now we mourn. A blessing Last week, Pounds posted clips of the pair in the studio, filmed by Paynes sister Ruth, who co-wrote the track. He also posted artwork showing an angel below a broken black heart. Talking about its planned official release, Pounds wrote on X: I pray that this will be a blessing to the world like Liam has always dreamed. I pray angels will comfort you all every day while listening. I pray that this song will be a blessing to Ruth, Bear, and the entire family. Payne shared his seven-year-old son, Bear, with Girls Aloud star Cheryl, who he was in a relationship with from 2016 to 2018.

        "title": "Indonesia arrests former trade minister in sugar import graft case",
        "date": "October 30, 2024 06:04 pm",
        "content": "Indonesian authorities investigating graft have arrested a former trade minister turned government critic on suspicion of improperly granting a sugar import permit in 2015 that led to losses of 25 million. Thomas Trikasih Lembong was named a suspect and arrested late on Tuesday by prosecutors from the attorney generals office, accused of giving the permit to a private company at a time when Indonesia had a surplus of sugar, the office said. At that time, Indonesia did not need to import sugar but (Lembong) granted a permit to import 105,000 metric tons of raw crystal sugar, prosecutor Abdul Qohar told a press conference. There was no consultation with other state bodies or a recommendation from the industry ministry, he said, adding that the decision had led to losses of 400 billion rupiah (25.42 million). Qohar did not say what Lembong is accused of having received in return for the permit to the company, which authorities identified only by its initials, PT AP. The attorney generals office denied that its investigation had a political motive. I surrender everything to God Almighty, media reported Lembong, handcuffed and wearing a pink detainee vest, as saying after the press conference. Reuters could not reach Lembong or his lawyer to seek comment. A former investment banker, Lembong was Indonesias trade minister between 2015 and 2016 and a close aide of former president Joko Jokowi Widodo, for whom he often wrote international speeches. But after leaving office in 2019, he became one of the staunchest critics of Jokowis government. Lembong was a campaign manager in Februarys presidential election for Anies Baswedan, who ran against the winner, defence minister Prabowo Subianto, widely seen as Jokowis preferred successor, who took office on Oct. 20 Indonesias sugar output in 2015 was 2.49 million metric tons, while consumption was 2.12 million.

        "title": "Sri Lanka to probe corruption in handling of X-Press Pearl disaster - report",
        "date": "October 30, 2024 06:36 pm",
        "content": "Sri Lankas new government, led by President Anura Kumara Dissanayake, will launch a fresh investigation into the handling of the MV X-Press Pearl cargo ship disaster that devastated marine life along swaths of the island nations coastline three years ago, a senior minister has told Al Jazeera. The announcement came amid allegations of corruption, delay tactics and mismanagement in dealing with the aftermath of the disaster, and a lack of compensation for the affected fishermen. In May 2021, the Singapore-registered cargo ship caught fire near Negombo, a popular tourist destination off the Sri Lankan west coast, spilling tonnes of hazardous substances, including nitric acid and microplastic granules, into the Indian Ocean. The fire on the ship, heading to Sri Lankas main city of Colombo from the Indian state of Gujarat, was believed to have been caused by a nitric acid leak. The toxic leak from the ship killed a large number of fish, turtles and other marine mammals, and devastated the livelihoods of more than 20,000 fishing families. Three years after the fire and oil leak on the ship, people are still awaiting justice in the form of compensation and accountability. Dissanayakes government now plans to investigate the incident after the countrys parliamentary elections conclude on November 14. There are many allegations about the X-Press Pearl disaster, Vijitha Herath, the countrys public security minister told Al Jazeera and Watershed Investigations, a United Kingdom-based nonprofit investigative journalism organisation focusing on water issues. I am personally committed to finding out the truth. We will leave no stone unturned. Risk of money laundering Based on an estimate by a 40-member committee of experts appointed by the countrys Marine Environmental Protection Authority (MEPA) soon after the disaster, Sri Lanka is seeking 6.4bn from London PI Club, the UK-based insurers of the X-Press Pearl, as compensation for the environmental damage caused by the disaster. The lawsuit was filed in Singapore in April 2023 under the then government, headed by President Ranil Wickremesinghe. In September this year, a report by the countrys Parliamentary Select Committee (PSC), formed to investigate the handling of the cargo ship disaster and mitigate future risks, said Sri Lanka has so far received nearly 12.5m from London PI Club. In addition to that, over the last three years, the MEPA received 3.5m rupees (11,945), while the Department of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources accepted about 3bn rupees (10.5m) from London PI Club  all in local currency, a fact that has raised suspicions of corruption and will now be investigated by the new government. Darshani Lahandapura, the former head of MEPA, had led the beach cleaning operations following the disaster. She told Al Jazeera that she had come under government pressure to accept the compensation payments in local currency at a time when the country was going through its worst economic crisis as inflation had soared and the Sri Lankan rupee was depreciating. Government officials from Wickremesinghes administration exerted pressure on me several times to accept the payment in Sri Lankan rupees, Lahandapura said. By asking to pay the compensation in local currency, I believe the shipowners were trying to take an undue advantage of the economic crisis and some government officials were supporting their demand, she added. The value of the Sri Lankan rupee slumped by almost 50 percent against the US dollar in 2022 when the economic crisis started. Lahandapura told the PSC she had strongly resisted accepting payments in rupees. But the insurers still made two payments in the local currency. In her view, accepting payments in rupees might pose a risk of money laundering, the PSC said in its report, referring to Lahandapuras statement. Al Jazeera reached out to the London PI Club to comment on the allegations, but did not receive any response. Alleged delay in demanding compensation The PSC report concluded that the disaster exposed critical gaps in the countrys ability to prevent and manage maritime pollution incidents. The Committee found that delays in legal proceedings and inadequate coordination between government agencies had exacerbated the environmental and economic damage, it said. Moreover, the lawsuit demanding compensation from the London PI Club was served by the Sri Lankan authorities 23 months after the disaster occurred, just days before the deadline, stipulated under international law, was set to expire. The law mandates that a claim for compensation in case of a marine accident must be made within two years of the incident. The lawsuit was filed under then-Attorney General Sanjay Rajaratnam. There seemed to be some lethargy or intentional delay from the Attorney Generals Department (AGD) in handling the X-Press Pearl vessel disaster case, Lahandapura, the former head of MEPA, told the parliamentary committee. However, the then minister of justice, Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe, blamed the MEPA for the delay in filing the lawsuit, saying the marine agency submitted its environmental impact report late. According to an anonymous official source in the Sri Lankan government, the Attorney Generals Department responded promptly to requests from the shipowners, but took a long time to respond to MEPAs queries. I dont have evidence to suggest anyone at the AGD received any financial benefit, but if the countrys AGD was lethargic in handling such an important case, it certainly raises suspicion, the source told Al Jazeera. Al Jazeera reached out to the Attorney Generals Department for its response to the allegation, but it has not yet received a response. Al Jazeera also sought a response from Rajaratnam, under whom the lawsuit was filed, but he refused to comment. Why Singapore? Another contentious issue likely to be investigated is the decision for the compensation case to be heard in Singapore, where the ship was registered, instead of Sri Lanka, where the accident occurred. What we recommended was to litigate the legal case in Sri Lanka, Dan Malika Gunasekara, a legal expert appointed by MEPA, told Al Jazeera. However, the Attorney Generals decision to file it in Singapore raises severe questions as to how he arrived at such a decision considering all the surrounding circumstances, especially concerning the consequences. Gunasekara was referring to a problem, also highlighted in the PSC report, that due to Singapore being a signatory to the Convention of Limitation of Liability for Maritime Claims (LLMC Convention), the compensation could be limited to approximately 19 million GBP (24.7m). As the government had estimated the legal costs could reach 10m, it would leave just about 14m for cleanup and compensation. Critics say the decision to move the lawsuit to Singapore cost the government of Sri Lanka dearly. The cabinet of ministers had initially estimated 4.2m as legal costs in Singapore but it was later amended and now 10m has been allocated for the Attorney Generals Department, said Asela Rekawa, who succeeded Lahandapura as MEPA chairman. We were told that we ended up spending precious foreign currency reserves at a time when Sri Lanka was facing bankruptcy because of the foreign currency deficit, said Professor Ajith de Alwis, co-chair of the MEPA-appointed scientific committee. In addition, precious little support was available to study the issue in many ways. However, according to the PSC report, the London PI Club had expressed concerns about coming to Sri Lanka due to the adverse publicity and security fears and preferred to join the negotiations over the compensation in Singapore. The then Sri Lankan minister of justice, Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe, also defended the choice of Singapore to litigate the issue. Singapore is home to thousands of shipping companies and no company would risk damaging their business by ignoring a ruling from a Singaporean court, he told Al Jazeera, adding that the decision was made following advice from an Australian legal firm. In any case, it might have been difficult to enforce the judgement on a UK company by a Sri Lankan court, he said. According to the countrys Fisheries Department, nearly 20,000 fishermen have been paid a total of nearly 10m, but a leader of the fishing trade union said it was not enough. The fishermen received different amounts of money as per the area, between 10,000 rupees (66) and 270,000 rupees (900) but some had to submit appeals and nearly 2,000 indirect fishermen are still hoping to get any compensation, Roger Peiris, a leader of a fishing trade union, told Al Jazeera, referring to people who sell fish, own boats, or those involved in the dry fish industry. But I dont even count this as compensation, it was just for lack of an immediate income. Compensation for fishermen is something that needs to be discussed separately. Fishermen would only get proper compensation after the legal issues are over. Source: Al Jazeera --Agencies",

The arrests were made during a raid conducted following a tip-off received by the Walana Central Anti-Vice Unit. Police apprehended two main suspects involved in the racket along with three accomplices, and seized 17 kg and 234 grams of ambergris found in their possession. The suspects have been handed over to the Pitigala Police Station for further investigations. Ambergris, also called grey amber or whale vomit, is created by the bile duct of the sperm whale and is often referred to as floating gold due to the immense price it fetches in the international market for its use in luxury perfumes. However, it is reported that certain individuals are also engaged in the racket of slaughtering whales in the deep seas around Sri Lanka with the aim of obtaining Ambergris to sell it for high prices.",

        "title": "Spain battles deadliest flood disaster in decades as death toll rises to 95",
        "date": "October 31, 2024 07:55 am",
        "content": "Spain is enduring its worst flooding disaster in decades, with at least 95 people dead and dozens more missing, after huge rains swept the eastern province of Valencia and beyond. Torrential rain on Tuesday triggered flash floods which swept away bridges and buildings and forced people to climb on to roofs or cling to trees to survive. Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez has declared three days of national mourning as the extreme conditions continue, restricting some rescue efforts. The death toll is feared to climb as there are many missing people, the government says. At least 92 deaths were recorded in Valencia, with another two in Castilla-La Mancha to Valencias west and one in Málaga - a 71-year-old British man who died in hospital after being rescued from his home. The flooding death toll is the countrys worst since 1973, when at least 150 people were estimated to have died in the nations worst-ever floods in the south-east. In his national address on Wednesday, Sánchez urged citizens to remain vigilant and pledged a full recovery, telling victims: The whole of Spain weeps with you we wont abandon you. One of the first towns affected near Valencia, Chiva, reported one years worth of rainfall on Tuesday in just a period of eight hours, according to national weather agency Aemet. As Spanish army and emergency crews rushed to carry out rescues on Wednesday morning - including winching people to safety from balconies and car rooftops - survivors in Valencia recounted the horror of the floods on Tuesday night. Sudden surges turned streets and roads into rivers, catching many motorists unaware. Guillermo Serrano Pérez, 21, from Paiporta near Valencia, said the water had rushed down a highway like a tsunami, forcing him and his parents to abandon their car and climb on to a bridge to survive. Another witness recounted a scene when motorway drivers realised a torrent of water was heading towards them and formed a human chain to escape along a raised central reservation. Thank goodness no one slipped because if anyone had fallen, the current would have dragged them away, Patricia Rodriguez, 45, told El País newspaper. One resident of La Torre told the BBC some of his friends had lost their homes, and on Tuesday night he saw cars floating in the water and the tides breaking through some walls. Meanwhile, the mayor of Horno de Alcedo, a town just outside Valencia, told BBC Newshour how the water levels rose by more than a metre in just a matter of minutes. The currents were so quick  and we called the emergency services who started rescuing some people who had water up to their necks, Consuelo Tarazon said. There are widespread accusations in Spain that in many cases, disaster relief authorities were too slow to act with warnings, meaning people could not get off roads or seek higher ground. The civil protection agency, deployed during national disasters, did not issue an alert until 20:15 on Tuesday evening local time  but by then, Chiva and several other towns had already been flooded for at least two hours. Valencias regional government has also been forced to defend its decision to scrap the Valencia Emergency Unit, which had been set up by the previous government to tackle natural disasters such as flooding and wildfires. Spain deployed more than 1,000 troops to help with rescue efforts on Wednesday, but many crews remain cut off from towns by flooded roads and downed communication and power lines. The European Unions chief, Ursula von der Leyen, said it had activated its Copernicus satellite system to help co-ordinate Spanish rescue teams. Other European neighbours have also offered to send reinforcements. Spains Defence Minister Margarita Robles had said earlier on Wednesday the flooding across the region was an unprecedented phenomenon. The downpour eased in the countrys central-east on Wednesday, but weather officials warned the rains were moving north-east to the Catalonia region. Weather warnings have also been issued across several other parts of the country, urging people to brace for floods and take shelter. Many factors contribute to flooding, but a warming atmosphere caused by climate change makes extreme rainfall more likely. Weather researchers have identified the likely main cause of the intense rainfall as a gota fria  a natural weather event that hits Spain in autumn and winter when cold air descends on warmer waters over the Mediterranean. However, the increase in global temperatures had led to the clouds carrying more rain, scientists told the BBC. With every fraction of a degree of fossil fuel warming, the atmosphere can hold more moisture, leading to heavier bursts of rainfall, said Dr Friederike Otto, from Imperial College London, who leads an international group of scientists who try to understand the role that warming plays in these type of events. No doubt about it, these explosive downpours were intensified by climate change. The world has already warmed by about 1.1C since the industrial era began and temperatures will keep rising unless governments around the world make steep cuts to emissions. Source: BBC --Agencies",

He stated that this festival serves as a symbol of hope, joy, and the triumph of good over evil, uniting communities in a spirit of harmony and celebration. He observes that, similarly, Sri Lankans have long sought progress amidst challenges since independence, and today, new hope is emerging as long-suppressed aspirations come to life. Now, fresh hope is emerging as the realization of their long-held hopes. The President stated that we have entered an era of renaissance, where the aspirations of the people, which were suppressed by past rulers, are finally coming to the forefront. Presidents full message for the Diwali Festival Hindu devotees around the world celebrate Diwali with great devotion, symbolizing the victory of light over darkness. This festival represents hope, joy, and the triumph of good over evil, bringing communities together in a spirit of unity and celebration. In Sri Lanka, the people have been searching for light in the dark for decades after gaining independence. Now, fresh hope is emerging as the realization of their long-held hopes. We have entered an era of renaissance, where the aspirations of the people, which were suppressed by past rulers, are finally coming to the forefront. Several legends inspire the celebration of Diwali. Among them is the return of King Rama, Sita, and Lakshmana to Ayodhya after their fourteen year exile. Another story is the defeat of the Asura Narakasura by Lord Vishnu. These significant events are remembered and honoured by Hindu devotees during this vibrant festival. Only the light of science can dispel the darkness of ignorance. Therefore, I urge everyone to light the Diwali of wisdom this year. Let this Diwali be a precious occasion for Sri Lankans to embrace a new way of thinking, fostering enlightenment and progress for all. Let us appreciate the beauty of cultural diversity by extending respect, acceptance, and brotherhood toward one another. The time has come for the Sri Lankan nation, which has faced attempts at division and weakening, to stand undivided and strong. By rooting out injustice, discrimination, marginalization, hate speech, and violence, we can lead the way in ending the political culture that creates divisions and fosters inequality between the privileged and the underprivileged. I invite everyone to join in creating a new cultural existence that embodies compassion and critical thought. This Diwali, I emphasize the importance of a cultural, political, and attitudinal transformation if we are to realize our hope of a prosperous country and a fulfilling life for all. On this day of Diwali, just as the light of countless lamps illuminates homes and cities, may the light of harmony and wisdom spread in the hearts of everyone. --PMD--",
