        "date": "January 1, 2023 09:51 am",
        "content": "Notorious underworld gangster Mohamed Najim Mohamed Imran alias Kanjipani Imran sneaked into Rameswaram days after his release on bail by a court in Sri Lanka, The Hindu reported quoting police sources. The Tamil Nadu intelligence has sounded an alert to senior police officers across the State to mount vigil along the coastal districts and look for him and his associate who landed along the Ramanathapuram district coast on December 25, 2022. Imran, wanted by the Sri Lankan authorities for various offences, including murders and criminal intimidation, was arrested in Dubai in 2019 and deported to the Island Nation. He was in judicial custody till a local court granted him bail on payment of two sureties, each 5 million local currencies. The State intelligence had a specific input from central intelligence agencies and reliable sources that Imran was planning to enter India after his release on bail. The information was that he left the court in disguise and moved to Thalaimannar from where his associates were making arrangements for his infiltration into India, the sources said. Imran is a drug kingpin with strong connections with heroin and cocaine suppliers based out of Afghanistan and Pakistan. He is facing several cases in Sri Lanka. On information that Imran would attend a birthday function in Dubai, a special team arrested him there in 2019. His gang is actively involved in big time smuggling of drugs across maritime boundary lines, a senior police officer told The Hindu on Saturday. Though there is no formal communication from Sri Lanka on Imran escaping to India, intelligence agencies received credible input on his movement and issued the alert, the officer who did not want to be quoted said. The entry of Imran into Tamil Nadu gains significance in the backdrop of the National Investigation Agency exposing an international drug cartel involving Sri Lankan nationals operating from the Special Camp in Tiruchi that houses foreign nationals facing criminal charges. CommissionersSuperintendents of Police, particularly in the coastal districts, have been alerted to enhance surveillance at vulnerable locations and activate their intelligence machinery to trace the suspect. Police sources said that the NIA was also tracking the movement and activities of Imran and his associates as investigators believed that he had close links with Haji Salim of Pakistan and Gunasekaran alias Gun, the prime suspect in the Vizhinjam drugs and arms trafficking case, where coastal security agencies seized 301 kg heroin, five AK 47 rifles and 1000 9-mm ammunition from six Sri Lankan nationals, who were found on vessel Ravihansi off Vizhinjam on March 25, 2021.

        "date": "January 1, 2023 02:59 pm",
        "content": "Pakistans new year celebrations were marred by customary gunfire by the exuberant revellers in several big cities, injuring at least 22 people, including children and women, in the Karachi metropolis. As the clock struck midnight to announce the arrival of the new year on Saturday, the port city resonated with the sounds of heavy gunfire. According to Pakistan television network Geo TV, several people, including a child and women, were injured in the aerial firing in different parts of Karachi despite a ban on the display of firearms. Sources from the hospitals said eight people with injuries were admitted to the Civil Hospital, four to Jinnah Hospital, and ten, including women and children, were taken to Abbasi Shaheed Hospital for treatment. So far 13 people have been arrested in connection with the firing in Korangi, three of whom have been charged with attempted murder. The channel further reported that Karachiites took to the streets and roads to celebrate the new year. The Five Star Chowrangi was thronged by people in a festive mood. Sindh Governor Kamran Tessori was also seen joining the masses to watch fireworks at the Numaish Chowrangi. Other sites that were thronged by people to witness the annual bash included Clifton Seaview, Do Darya, Bahria Town and Bagh Ibn Qasim. Separately, various clubs, hotels and organisations also organised fireworks to welcome 2023. Similar reports of celebrations were also received from Lahore, Islamabad and Rawalpindi. Incidents of injuries due to gunfire were also reported from Lahore but it was independently confirmed. The new year celebrations have been controversial in Pakistan as clerics look down on the revelries and consider it a sin to imitate western culture. However, over the years an increase has been noticed in the number of people taking to the streets to celebrate this annual event. Traditionally, club-carrying activists of right-wing Jamaat-e-Islami would disrupt the gathering of youths and roam on the streets of big cities to scare people away. However, they too have toned down their pious work with the passage of time. President Dr Arif Alvi and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif felicitated the nation and international community at the beginning of the New Year and prayed for the development, progress and prosperity of Pakistan as well as peace in the world. In their separate messages, they stressed the need to work together to make Pakistan the cradle of peace, prosperity and development, according to their official statements. The President in his message said the nation faced various challenges last year but overcame difficult situations due to hard work, sacrifice, determination and resilience. In the new year, as a nation we must set our priorities correctly to overcome the challenges facing the nation, he said. The Prime Minister in his message hoped that the new year would prove to be the year of ending hunger, war, terrorism, crime, sectarianism and class division from the whole world, including Pakistan. The Prime Minister reiterated his resolve to work day and night for improvement of the economic situation of the country, rehabilitation of flood victims, end of terrorism and reduction in sufferings of the people.

It is likely to be doubled or tripled. It could be increased up to 60 to 70 by tomorrow. If that happens, the running trains will not be able to carry the total capacity of commuters, he added. Passengers who come to the railway stations will create conflicts. We can definitely state that this situation will arise on the very first day of the year. Office commuters will be severely affected, he said. Mr. Somaratne also pointed out that the provision of services by the retired employees on contract basis as required has not been accomplished so far. The Railway Department has removed 04 employees who were working with no approval for about one and half years, without making payments for them, the President of the union claimed. Also, even though new station masters were recruited to overcome the shortage of station masters, the appointments have not been approved since 2013, and as a result, the Matara and Beliatta Railway Stations will have to be closed in the coming period, he further emphasized. Mr. Somaratne further stressed that if a proper solution will not be provided for this issue next week, they will definitely launch a strike by January 09, against these collapses that have arisen within the Railway Department.",

Mr. Alahakoon, who further accused that some politicians also assist in these rackets, also charged that the intermediate egg trading associations are responsible for this issue. Those who said they could sell eggs at the gazetted price of Rs. 43 then, are now talking about selling it at Rs.65 or Rs.60. During the discussion held with Minister Mahinda Amaraweera, the Minister asked to create a procedure that the eggs are directly sold to the consumer, he said, adding that they distributed 400,000 eggs in Colombo city accordingly. They are trying to show that this procedure is a failure. Do the Minister of Trade and some associations who speak for the consumer also speak out for the egg traders?, Mr. Alahakoon questioned. He also claimed that the President of one of the egg producers associations is the brother-in-law of the Minister of Trade. So, the Trade Minister can say that this work is wrong and to stop it. There is no point in criticizing us. There is a mafia in this that takes eggs at a low price, freezes them in the cool room and sells them again at a higher price. Some ministers are helping that.",

Speaking at a media briefing today (Jan. 01), its chairman Janaka Ratnayake stated that the CEB should at first present the proposal to the PUCSL for them to consider a tariff hike and that the Cabinet cannot take decisions in this regard. The CEB announced yesterday (Dec. 31) that the newly proposed electricity tariff hike is expected to be presented to the Cabinet tomorrow (Jan. 02). As per the proposal, more rates are expected to be charged from households consuming electricity units between 0 - 30, 31 - 60, 61  90 and 91 - 120. The current unit rate of Rs. 8 for households utilizing 30 units or less will be raised to Rs.30, with a hike of 375. The tariff for 31 - 60 units consumed, will be increased by 370, which is an increase of the current rate of Rs. 10 up to Rs. 37. The Rs. 10 tariff per unit for households using units between 61 and 90 will be increased to Rs.42. It is a 420 increase than the prevailing rates. However, this move to increase the electricity tariffs once again has come under heavy criticism of the electricity regulator, the PUCSL. Chairman of the PUCSL, Mr. Ratnayake further expressed that the CEB is trying to increase the tariffs of low user categories, highlighting that the electricity consumption has been reduced by 15 already, with the earlier tariff hikes.",

        "date": "January 1, 2023 09:41 pm",
        "content": "Philippine authorities halted flights in and out of Manila on New Years Day due to a malfunction of air traffic control, which also prevented airlines bound to other destinations from using the countrys airspace. A total of 282 flights were either delayed, cancelled or diverted to other regional airports, affecting around 56,000 passengers at Manilas Ninoy Aquino International Airport (NAIA), the airport operator said on Sunday. It was unclear how many overflights were affected. Transportation Secretary Jaime Bautista apologized for the inconvenience to passengers as he blamed a power outage for the breakdown of the central air traffic control system that also affected operations at other airports in the country. He said the outdated existing facility should be upgraded immediately and that a back-up system was also needed. This is air traffic management system issue, he said in a media briefing. If you will compare us with Singapore, for one, there is a big difference, they are at least 10 years ahead of us. As of 0800 GMT, the system has been partially restored thereby allowing limited flight operations, the Manila International Airport Authority said in a statement. By late evening, eight flight arrivals and eight departures had been allowed, according to the airport operator. Video clips and photos posted on social media showed long queues at the airport and airline personnel distributing food packs and drinks to stranded passengers. Were told radar and navigation facilities at NAIA down. I was on my way home fm Tokyo - 3 hours into the flight, but had to return to Haneda, tweeted one passenger - Manuel Pangilinan, chairman of Philippine telecommunications conglomerate PLDT Inc. 6 hours of useless flying but inconvenience to travellers and losses to tourism and business are horrendous.

        "title": "Global economy faces tougher year in 2023, IMF chief warns",
        "date": "January 2, 2023 07:47 am",
        "content": "(Reuters) - For much of the global economy, 2023 is going to be a tough year as the main engines of global growth - the United States, Europe and China - all experience weakening activity, the head of the International Monetary Fund said on Sunday. The new year is going to be tougher than the year we leave behind, IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said on the CBS Sunday morning news program Face the Nation. Why? Because the three big economies - the U.S., EU and China - are all slowing down simultaneously, she said. In October, the IMF cut its outlook for global economic growth in 2023, reflecting the continuing drag from the war in Ukraine as well as inflation pressures and the high interest rates engineered by central banks like the U.S. Federal Reserve aimed at bringing those price pressures to heel. Since then, China has scrapped its zero-COVID policy and embarked on a chaotic reopening of its economy, though consumers there remain wary as coronavirus cases surge. In his first public comments since the change in policy, President Xi Jinping on Saturday called in a New Years address for more effort and unity as China enters a new phase. For the first time in 40 years, Chinas growth in 2022 is likely to be at or below global growth, Georgieva said. Moreover, a bushfire of expected COVID infections there in the months ahead are likely to further hit its economy this year and drag on both regional and global growth, said Georgieva, who traveled to China on IMF business late last month. I was in China last week, in a bubble in a city where there is zero COVID, she said. But that is not going to last once people start traveling. For the next couple of months, it would be tough for China, and the impact on Chinese growth would be negative, the impact on the region will be negative, the impact on global growth will be negative, she said. In Octobers forecast, the IMF pegged Chinese gross domestic product growth last year at 3.2 - on par with the funds global outlook for 2022. At that time, it also saw annual growth in China accelerating in 2023 to 4.4 while global activity slowed further. Her comments, however, suggest another cut to both the China and global growth outlooks may be in the offing later this month when the IMF typically unveils updated forecasts during the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. U.S. ECONOMY MOST RESILIENT Meanwhile, Georgieva said, the U.S. economy is standing apart and may avoid the outright contraction that is likely to afflict as much as a third of the worlds economies. The U.S. is most resilient, she said, and it may avoid recession. We see the labor market remaining quite strong. But that fact on its own presents a risk because it may hamper the progress the Fed needs to make in bringing U.S. inflation back to its targeted level from the highest levels in four decades touched last year. Inflation showed signs of having passed its peak as 2022 ended, but by the Feds preferred measure, it remains nearly three times its 2 target. This is ... a mixed blessing because if the labor market is very strong, the Fed may have to keep interest rates tighter for longer to bring inflation down, Georgieva said. Last year, in the most aggressive policy tightening since the early 1980s, the Fed lifted its benchmark policy rate from near zero in March to the current range of 4.25 to 4.50, and Fed officials last month projected it will breach the 5 mark in 2023, a level not seen since 2007. Indeed, the U.S. job market will be a central focus for Fed officials who would like to see demand for labor slacken to help undercut price pressures. The first week of the new year brings a raft of key data on the employment front, including Fridays monthly nonfarm payrolls report, which is expected to show the U.S. economy minted another 200,000 jobs in December and the jobless rate remained at 3.7 - near the lowest since the 1960s.

        "date": "January 2, 2023 08:04 am",
        "content": "At least 11 scheduled trains were cancelled this morning (Jan. 02) owing to issues arising over Sri Lanka Railway employee retirements. However, the issue is expected to be resolved today, says the Ministry of Transport. Meanwhile the Railway Station Masters Union (RSMU) had warned that that more than 60 train journeys may have to be cancelled, as a result of the vacancies created by the retirement of nearly 500 individuals from the entire railway staff, since December 31. Speaking to reporters yesterday, the President of the RSMU, Sumedha Somaratne said that 44 trains were scheduled to be cancelled on December 31, and that already multiple trains were cancelled with this figure expected to rise by today. If that happens, the running trains will not be able to carry the total capacity of commuters, he added. The Railway Station Masters Union (RSMU) also pointed out that the provision of services by the retired employees on contract basis as required has not been accomplished so far. Also, even though new station masters were recruited to overcome the shortage of station masters, the appointments have not been approved since 2013, and as a result, the Matara and Beliatta Railway Stations will have to be closed in the coming period, Mr. Somaratne further stressed. Station Masters warned that if a proper solution will not be provided for this issue next week, they will definitely launch a strike by January 09, against these collapses that have arisen within the Railway Department. It is reported that due to shortage of railway employees, around 96 train journeys have been canceled within the last two days alone. It is reported that 36 journeys including 24 passenger trains and 12 cargo trains have been canceled yesterday (01), and 59 journeys including 48 passenger trains and 11 cargo trains were cancelled on December 31. Deputy General Manager of Railways Mr. Gamini Senaviratne, responding to an inquiry made by Ada Derana, said that the effect of the same situation will continue today and a significant number of trains may be cancelled. However, he further stated that the Railway Department is taking necessary steps to avoid the inconveniences caused to the passengers.",

The President made these remarks while addressing the staff of the Presidents Office who commenced duties of the New Year 2023 at the Presidential Secretariat in Colombo this morning (Jan. 02), the Presidents Media Division reported. President Ranil Wickremesinghe also said that no one can shirk their responsibilities for the country in the year 2023, which is a crucial year for the Sri Lankan economy, and invited all public servants to dedicate themselves towards making Sri Lanka a prosperous nation in the New Year. President Wickremesinghe has hoisted the National Flag marking the commencement of duties in the New Year, and all staff members of the Presidential Secretariat took the public service pledge together, according to the PMD. Thereafter, the President joined the staff members for a tea party, and he also extended his best wishes to the staff for the New Year. President Ranil Wickremesinghe further said, I wish you all a happy and prosperous New Year. Five and a half months ago, we took over a historic task at this office. During those five and a half months, we took steps to establish normalcy in the country at a time when the government had collapsed and the economy had also collapsed. However, not all our economic problems are over yet. Nevertheless, today we have the ability to provide fuel, gas, foodstuff and fertilizer as required. I must first extend my gratitude to all those who assisted us during these five and a half months. However, our task is not over yet. The most crucial year is 2023. We have to move forward by implementing the debt-restructuring program and freeing our country from the debt burden. Moreover, we have to build an economy that can compete with the new world. The opinion of the majority is that there is a need for a change in the political system of this country. We have to fulfil both these things, said the President. We also need to come up with a new method that can solve the problems of todays political system. We need greater unity among us than last year. We look at this government as a sort of mechanism. This is not divided into several programs by ministries. All work as sub-parts of the same mechanism. Therefore, there can be no competition or tug of war between anyone and no one can put a limit to their responsibilities. All of you should be bound to implement the basic policies of the country. The core of the program is the Presidents Office, as well as the Cabinet Office and the Prime Ministers Office. It is from these institutions that these activities will be carried out. Each persons duties cannot be limited to 08 hours a day and 05 days a week. Lets all work with commitment. By the end of 2023, I hope to take this country forward with the support of all of you and restore normalcy. Member of Parliament Vajira Abeywardena, Presidents Senior Adviser on National Security and Chief of Presidential Staff Sagala Ratnayake, Presidents Secretary Saman Ekanayake and senior officers of the Presidential Secretariat and all staff members were also present on this occasion, the PMD reported.",

        "title": "Brazils Lula sworn in, vows accountability and rebuilding",
        "date": "January 2, 2023 11:03 am",
        "content": "Brazils Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva was sworn in as president on Sunday, and in his first address expressed optimism about plans to rebuild while pledging that members of outgoing Jair Bolsonaros administration will be held to account. Lula is assuming office for the third time after thwarting far-right incumbent Bolsonaros reelection bid. His return to power marks the culmination of a political comeback that is thrilling supporters and enraging opponents in a fiercely polarized nation. Our message to Brazil is one of hope and reconstruction, Lula said in a speech in Congress Lower House after signing the document that formally instates him as president. The great edifice of rights, sovereignty and development that this nation built has been systematically demolished in recent years. To re-erect this edifice, we are going to direct all our efforts. Sunday afternoon in Brasilias main esplanade, the party was on. Tens of thousands of supporters decked out in the red of Lulas Workers Party cheered after his swearing in. They celebrated when the president said he would send a report about the prior administration to all lawmakers and judicial authorities, revoke Bolsonaros criminal decrees that loosened gun control, and hold the prior administration responsible for its denialism in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. We do not carry any spirit of revenge against those who sought to subjugate the nation to their personal and ideological designs, but we are going to ensure the rule of law, Lula said, without mentioning Bolsonaro by name. Those who erred will answer for their errors, with broad rights to their defense within the due legal process. Lulas presidency is unlikely to be like his previous two mandates, coming after the tightest presidential race in more than three decades in Brazil and resistance to his taking office by some of his opponents, political analysts say. The leftist defeated Bolsonaro in the Oct. 30 vote by less than 2 percentage points. For months, Bolsonaro had sown doubts about the reliability of Brazils electronic vote and his loyal supporters were loath to accept the loss. Many have gathered outside military barracks since, questioning results and pleading with the armed forces to prevent Lula from taking office. His most die-hard backers resorted to what some authorities and incoming members of Lulas administration labeled acts of terrorism  which had prompted security concerns about inauguration day events. Lula will have to navigate more challenging economic conditions than he enjoyed in his first two terms, when the global commodities boom proved a windfall for Brazil. At the time, his administrations flagship welfare program helped lift tens of millions of impoverished people into the middle class. He left office with a personal approval rating of 83. In the intervening years, Brazils economy plunged into two deep recessions  first, during the tenure of his handpicked successor, and then during the pandemic  and ordinary Brazilians suffered greatly. Lula has said his priorities are fighting poverty, and investing in education and health. He has also said he will bring illegal deforestation of the Amazon to a halt. He sought support from political moderates to form a broad front and defeat Bolsonaro, then tapped some of them to serve in his Cabinet. In his first act as president Sunday, Lula signed a decree to tighten gun control and set a 30-day deadline for the comptroller-generals office to evaluate various Bolsonaro decrees that placed official information under seal for 100 years. He also signed a decree that guaranteed a monthly stipend for poor families, and reestablished the mostly Norway-financed Amazon fund for sustainable development in the rainforest. Claúdio Arantes, a 68-year-old pensioner, carried an old Lula campaign flag on his way to the esplanade. The lifelong Lula supporter attended his 2003 inauguration, and agreed that this time feels different. Back then, he could talk about Brazil being united. Now it is divided and wont heal soon, Arantes said. I trust his intelligence to make this national unity administration work so we never have a Bolsonaro again. Given the nations political fault lines, it is highly unlikely Lula ever reattains the popularity he once enjoyed, or even sees his approval rating rise above 50, said Maurício Santoro, a political science professor at Rio de Janeiros State University. Furthermore, Santoro said, the credibility of Lula and his Workers Party were assailed by a sprawling corruption investigation. Party officials were jailed, including Lula  whose convictions were later annulled on procedural grounds. The Supreme Court then ruled that the judge presiding over the case had colluded with prosecutors to secure a conviction. Lula and his supporters have maintained he was railroaded. Others were willing to look past possible malfeasance as a means to unseat Bolsonaro and bring the nation back together. I always wanted to go the inauguration, I didnt think I would have a chance to see Lula there after he was jailed, said Tamires Valente, 43, a marketing professional from Brasilia. I am very emotional, Lula deserves this. But Bolsonaros backers refuse to accept someone they view as a criminal returning to the highest office. And with tensions running hot, a series of events has prompted fear that violence could erupt on inauguration day. On Dec. 12, dozens of people tried to invade a federal police building in Brasilia, and burned cars and buses in other areas of the city. Then on Christmas Eve, police arrested a 54-year-old man who admitted to making a bomb that was found on a fuel truck headed to Brasilias airport. He had been camped outside Brasilias army headquarters with hundreds of other Bolsonaro supporters since Nov. 12. He told police he was ready for war against communism, and planned the attack with people he had met at the protests, according to excerpts of his deposition released by local media. Bolsonaro finally condemned the bomb plot in a Dec. 30 farewell address on social media, hours before flying to the U.S.. His absence on inauguration day marks a break with tradition. Instead of Bolsonaro, a group representing diverse segments of society performed the role of presenting Lula with the presidential sash to Lula atop the ramp of the presidential palace. Across the sea of people standing before the palace, supporters stretched a massive Brazilian flag over their heads. Speaking to the crowd, Lula listed shortfalls in government funds that will affect the Brazilian people. He said that, according to the transition teams report on Bolsonaros government, textbooks havent been printed for public schools, there are insufficient free medications and COVID-19 vaccines, the threat looms of federal universities shutting down, and civil defense authorities cannot work to prevent disasters. Who pays the price for this blackout is, once again, the Brazilian people, he said, and was promptly met by a chant from the crowd: No amnesty! No amnesty! No amnesty!

During an interview with CBS News, the IMF Chief highlighted that, so far the countries that are in distress as a result of the debt borrowed in dollars are not systemically significant to trigger a debt crisis. In response to a question regarding whether the IMF notices the governments of low-income countries are collapsing with defaults, and how much of a contagion it will become, Ms. Georgieva stated that countries such as Chad, Ethiopia, Zambia, Ghana, Lebanon, Suriname and Sri Lanka are very important for their people to find the resolution to the debt problem, adding that the risk of contagion is not as high. 25 of emerging markets are trading in distressed territory. Then the world economy maybe for a bad surprise. And this is why the IMF working very hard to press for debt resolution for these countries and we have engaged in the traditional creditors, the Paris Club, and the non-traditional creditors China India, Saudi Arabia.

        "date": "January 2, 2023 05:55 pm",
        "content": "Two helicopters collided in an Australian tourist hotspot Monday afternoon, killing four passengers and critically injuring three others in a crash that drew emergency aid from beachgoers enjoying the water during the southern summer. One helicopter appeared to have been taking off and the other landing when they collided near the Sea World theme park in Main Beach, a northern beach on the Gold Coast, Gary Worrell, Queensland state police acting inspector, said at a news conference. One helicopter landed safely on a sandbank, but debris from the other was spread across an area police described as difficult to access. The dead and three most seriously injured people were all passengers in the crashed helicopter. Members of the public and police tried to remove the people and they commenced first aid and tried to get those people to safety from an airframe that was upside down, Worrell said. (People on) Jet Skis, family boaters, ordinary members of the public rushed to assist these people. Passengers in the other helicopter, which lost its windscreen in the crash, are also receiving medical assistance. Footage of the crash showed a helicopter shortly after takeoff being clipped by another helicopter flying over the water. Sea World Helicopters, a separate company from the theme park, expressed its condolences and said it was cooperating with the authorities handling the crash investigation. We and the entire flying community are devastated by what has happened and our sincere condolences go to all those involved and especially the loved ones and family of the deceased, the statement said. The company did not confirm if it operated one or both helicopters involved in the crash, saying in the statement it would not comment further because of the investigation. A witness named John told Melbourne radio station 3AW that patrons at Sea World heard the crash. He said staff at the theme park moved swiftly to close off areas closest to the crash. There was a massive, massive bang, he said. It was just huge. Im not sure if it was the propellers or whatever hitting against each other. But there was this poor lady and her son near the helipad in tears. Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk said the accident was an unthinkable tragedy. My deepest sympathies are with each of the families and everyone affected by this terrible accident, she said. Australian Transport Safety Bureau chief commissioner Angus Mitchell said an investigation into the cause of the crash was underway. Queensland Ambulance Service said earlier that 13 people were being assessed for injuries. The Gold Coast region is at its busiest in January, the peak time for holidays in Australias summer.

        "content": "Police said that two employees have been arrested over an alleged attack on the Chairman and Executive Director of the Maga Neguma Construction Equipment Company at its office in Peliyagoda today (02). In a communiqué, the Police Media Division said that the two suspects have been arrested by Peliyagoda Police and that both are residents of the Beliatta area, aged 57 and 49 years. One of the suspects is reportedly the President of Maga Neguma Projects drivers association and the other suspect is a committee member of the same association. They have been arrested according to a complaint that they attacked the chairman and executive director during a tea ceremony held at the Maga Neguma project office in Peliyagoda for the commencement of work in the year 2023. A ceremony was organized today (02) in the morning to coincide with the commencement of duties in the year 2023 at the head office of the Maga Neguma Construction Equipment Company located in Peliyagoda, which comes under the purview of the Ministry of Transport and Highways. After the religious observances in the morning, as the top officials of the company were preparing to address the employees present, Maga Neguma Company Chairman A.A. Yogendra Perera and Executive Director Mahesh Wickrama were attacked with food items including milk rice and traditional sweets by a group of workers. Subsequently, the members of the trade union had proceeded to hold the chairman and the executive director of the Maga Neguma company under house arrest within their office, while alleging that employees are being arbitrarily removed and deprived of privileges including accommodation. As a result of this, Peliyagoda Police and Special Task Force (STF) personnel were called in to control the situation at the office. After around three hours, the trade union members then agreed to allow the Chairman and Executive Director to safely leave the premises. It is also reported that this incident took place in the background of the Maga Neguma Companys deputy general manager (finance) and two other officers being suspended pending the completion of investigations in connection with the misappropriation of Rs. 2 billion.",

        "content": "(Reuters) - Mexican authorities said on Sunday at least 14 people died in an armed attack at a prison in the northern border city Juarez and two more died during a later armed aggression elsewhere in the city. The Chihuahua state prosecutor said in a statement that among those who died in the prison attack were 10 security personnel and four inmates, while another 13 were hurt and at least 24 escaped. It was not immediately clear who carried out the attack. The prosecutor said initial investigations found the attackers arrived at around 7 a.m. local time at the prison in armored vehicles and opened fire. Minutes earlier, authorities had reported a nearby attack against municipal police. After a chase, four men were captured and a truck seized. In a different part of the city, two more drivers died later in the day following what authorities called an armed aggression. The state prosecutor did not specify whether the three incidents were related. In August, hundreds of Mexican soldiers were sent to Juarez after a prison face-off between members of two rival cartels caused a riot and shootouts that killed 11 people, most of them civilians.

The incident had reportedly taken place on 17 December 2022, when the car in question, which was shot at by a police officer assigned to his protection, had been parked at Abeysekeras residence, police sources said. However, Abeysekera had not been at home at the time of the incident, and had not been informed of the incident either, by the relevant officer. Abeysekera later found out about the incident when he had gone to pump fuel into the car, and discovered a leak in the fuel tank. When the vehicle was then sent for repairs, it was revealed that the leak was caused due to a gunshot. The former CID Director subsequently informed the Officer- in-Charge (OIC) of the Borella Police Station of the incident, following which statements were recorded from the police officer involved in the shooting, while further investigations were handed over to the CID. Abseysekara was provided with police protection owing to the multiple death threats allegedly received by the former CID Director.",

        "content": "Foxconns COVID-hit iPhone plant in Chinas Zhengzhou city is almost back to full production, with its December shipments reaching about 90 of initial plans, two people with direct knowledge of the matter said. Foxconn, formally Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd, declined to comment. Production at the worlds largest manufacturing facility of Apple Incs iPhones was heavily affected late last year after a COVID-19 outbreak and curbs taken to control the virus prompted thousands of workers to leave. It was also hit by a bout of worker unrest over payment issues. Foxconn has been offering bonuses to attract new workers and convince those still there to stay on. A company source told Reuters last month that it was aiming for the plant to resume full production around late December to early January. Production has almost fully resumed, said one of the people on Tuesday, who declined to be identified as the information was private. The second person said production was nearly back to normal but that company officials remained cautious over the outlook due to a spike of COVID-19 cases across China. We expect a peak for cases before or after the Lunar New Year holiday, the person said, referring to the week-long break that starts on Jan 21. We dont know if that will cause any issues. On Saturday, the government-owned broadcaster of Henan province, where the plant is located, quoted an executive from the factory as saying that the plants workforce was currently stable at 200,000 staff and that it had also stabilised its supply chain, enabling production capacity to recover. The plant is able to accommodate as many as 300,000 workers. The Zhengzhou plants troubles highlighted the difficulties companies and workers had in adhering to Chinas zero-COVID-19 policy. The central government in early December, after Foxconns woes and a string of protests over the policy, abruptly dropped the policy to adopt a strategy of living with the virus. The move was greeted by widespread relief but has also precipitated a wave of infections across the country. Source - Reuters -Agencies",

        "content": "British rail workers kicked off the new year with a week-long strike on Tuesday, disrupting the return to work for millions of commuters in the latest bout of industrial action to hit the country. Britain is in the grip of its worst run of worker unrest since Margaret Thatcher was in power in the 1980s, as surging inflation follows more than 10 years of stagnant wage growth, leaving many workers unable to make ends meet. Repeated rail strikes have crippled the network in recent months while nurses, airport staff, paramedics and postal workers have also joined the fray, demanding higher pay to keep pace with inflation that is hovering around 40-year highs, reaching 10.7 in November. Teachers are due to go on strike in Scotland next week. Due to industrial action, there will be significantly reduced train services across the railway until Sunday 8 January, Network Rail said. Trains will be busier and likely to start later and finish earlier, and there will be no services at all in some places. The government has said it cannot afford to give public sector workers an inflation-matching rise, meaning there is no end in sight to what has been dubbed a new winter of discontent in reference to the industrial battles that gripped Britain in the late 1970s. A YouGov poll published in December found two-thirds of Britons support the nurses strike. The majority of those surveyed said the government was most to blame for the action and Prime Minister Rishi Sunak could suffer if the disruption runs through 2023. Mick Lynch, the head of the RMT rail union, said the government seemed content for the strikes to go ahead. All the parties involved know what needs to be done to get a settlement, but the government is blocking that, Lynch told the BBC. The government has called on union bosses to return to the negotiating table, aware that the strikes are taking a heavy toll on businesses that rely on commuters, such as coffee shops and pubs in town centres. The only way you get a deal sorted out is to get the trade unions and employers around the negotiating table and not on the picket line and thats what I want to see happen, Transport Minister Mark Harper told Times Radio.

        "title": "Young womans horrific death in hit-and-run shocks India",
        "date": "January 4, 2023 11:42 am",
        "content": "The gruesome death of a 20-year-old woman in Indias capital Delhi on 1 January has shocked the country. News reports say the woman, who was an event manager, was returning from work in the early hours of New Years Day when her scooter collided with a car. Police say the driver of the car, which was carrying four other passengers, kept going for miles, dragging the womans body along. Several CCTV videos have emerged that show the body underneath the car. Road accidents are common in India - and kill hundreds of thousands of people every year - but this particularly horrific case has gained national attention and generated widespread media coverage. The Indian Express newspaper reported that the womans body was pulled along the road for almost an hour, and that witnesses made at least five calls to the police before it was located. That this occurred at New Year - when thousands of policemen had been deployed to patrol Delhis roads - has only added to the questions around the case. The five men in the car are in police custody and have not made any statements yet. While the police continue their investigation - the federal home ministry has ordered a swift inquiry - the womans family says they are stunned. My daughter was very cheerful. She loved making Instagram Reels, her mother told BBC Hindi. The 20-year-old was also the sole breadwinner of her family - her father died some years ago, and her mother had to stop working because of an illness. We dont even have money to perform her last rites, her mother said. The dead womans family have alleged that she was sexually assaulted because her body was naked when it was recovered - but police have said the post-mortem report does not indicate this. All injuries occurred due to blunt force impact and possibly with a vehicular accident and dragging. Also, the report indicates that there is no injury suggestive of sexual assault, according to a statement from senior Delhi police official Sagar Preet Hooda. He said the provisional cause of death was shock and haemorrhage due to injury to the head, spine, left femur and both lower limbs. The police have also said they have located another woman who was riding pillion with the victim when the collision occurred - the second woman fled in fear and is now helping the police. Loud music drowned out the screams Police said the investigation began after they received two calls on Sunday morning - one regarding a woman being dragged by a Maruti Baleno car, and another after a womans body was found lying on a road in north Delhi. They found the car after launching a manhunt and arrested the accused. The five men have been charged with culpable homicide and causing death by negligence, Commissioner Hooda said. The accused had borrowed the car from a friend to drive it in the night between 31 December and 1 January, police said. They added that the accused said they panicked after hitting the scooter and sped off without realising that the womans body was being dragged along. Police have said the men will be taken to the scene of the crime to verify their version of events and that the car will be examined by a team of forensic experts. Officials also said they would use a dummy to try to recreate what happened. The accused men claim that they did not hear the victims screams because they were playing loud music in the car. Reports have said the men were drunk. Political blame game The case has also sparked a political row in the national capital. The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), which governs Delhi, has been protesting against the federal government over what they call weak security in the city. The AAP does not have any control over the citys police force, which reports to the federal home ministry. On Monday, party members protested outside Lieutenant Governor VK Saxenas office, demanding his resignation over the issue. The federal government appoints the lieutenant governor of Delhi. Speaking to the media, AAP spokesperson Saurabh Bhardwaj also alleged one of the five accused was a member of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and accused Mr Saxena and police officials of deliberately concealing this information. Earlier in the day, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal in a tweet demanded that exemplary action be taken against the accused, adding that no leniency should be shown towards them even if they had high political connections. Home Minister Amit Shah has not directly responded to the AAPs criticism, but he reportedly spoke to the police commissioner and has ordered a swift inquiry into the incident. Meanwhile, Mr Saxena said that he was overseeing the investigation. He had earlier said that he was shocked by the monstrous insensitivity of the perpetrators and that his head hangs in shame over the inhuman crime. Source: BBC",

        "title": "Chaos as US House adjourns without choosing speaker",
        "date": "January 4, 2023 11:55 am",
        "content": "The new US Congress was plunged into disarray Tuesday as renegade right-wing Republicans blocked favorite Kevin McCarthy from becoming speaker of the House of Representatives in a series of humiliating votes seen as a rebuke to the party establishment. The California congressman needed a simple majority to be elected as Washingtons top legislator, who presides over House business and is second in line to the presidency. But for the first time in a century, Republicans failed to elect a speaker in a nail-biting first three rounds of voting - given blanket coverage across US television networks. Rather than celebrating their new control of the House, the party instead faces a drawn-out fight to elect a speaker that could further deepen internal divisions - and put McCarthys political career on the line. The 57-year-old needed 218 votes in the lower chamber, which flipped to a narrow 222-212 Republican majority after last years midterm elections. But he failed to bring into line the party rebels, including several high-profile allies of former president Donald Trump, and he was shocked by 19 no votes from his own side in each of the first two rounds, rising to 20 in the third. His performance was so weak that he lost out to the Democratic minority leader Hakeem Jeffries in each of the opening three ballots - although there remains little doubt a Republican will ultimately claim the speakers gavel. McCarthy has long coveted the role, having withdrawn from the race in 2015 amid a number of blunders and a right-wing revolt. The next steps This time he was once again tripped up by far-right rebels, despite bowing to their calls to push aggressive investigations of Democrats including President Joe Biden after taking over the House. Lawmakers agreed to adjourn until Wednesday amid steadily building momentum among the Republicans to regroup overnight, lick their wounds and formulate a strategy to turn catastrophic defeat into an unlikely face-saving victory. The reality is Rep. Kevin McCarthy doesnt have the votes, Floridas Byron Donalds said in a statement ahead of the adjournment, urging fellow members of the party conference to recess and huddle in search of a breakthrough. The last time it took more than one round of voting to pick a speaker at the start of a new Congress was a century ago, in 1923. One speaker selection process in 1855 took 133 rounds of voting over two months. McCarthy - who had been trying to avoid small cliques wandering off the floor to hold their own negotiations - initially planned to keep members in the room and voting until he had managed to cudgel his rivals into submission. Some lawmakers and staffers backing McCarthy had started the day however saying that he should bow out if unable to secure the gavel in the second round, US media reported. The House is expected to hold further ballots from midday (1700 GMT) on Wednesday until someone emerges with a majority - and it is not out of the question that a new candidate who has not been part of the process could come to the fore. Trump loyalty One roadblock to McCarthys anointment was the perception by some on his partys far right that he is insufficiently loyal to Trump, who is running for the White House again after losing to Biden in 2020. No credible Republican alternative to McCarthy had emerged by the adjournment, although one obvious name would be incoming House majority leader Steve Scalise, a McCarthyite who has nevertheless been clear that he has ambitions of his own. The Never Kevin crowd are likely to see Scalise as more of the same, however. McCarthy, who defied a subpoena from the House panel probing the 2021 assault on the Capitol, has already promised the hardliners investigations of Bidens family and administration, as well as of the FBI and CIA. But the more he is seen as giving in to the right, the more likely he is to alienate moderates, sparking open war between Senate and House Republicans, where there is already little love lost. It wasnt all doom and gloom for the Republicans in Congress. The Senate also convened for its new term Tuesday, with Mitch McConnell, who heads the Republican minority, breaking the record for the longest-serving Senate leader.

        "content": "Canada admitted a record number of immigrants in 2022, as the federal government works toward a goal of admitting 500,000 newcomers each year by 2025. There were 431,645 new permanent residents last year according to Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada, topping a high in 2021 of 405,000. Prime Minister Justin Trudeaus government is trying to catch up from a slowdown in immigration in the first year of the pandemic, and admit nearly 1.5mn new permanent residents over the next three years. The government aims to accept a minimum of 500,000 immigrants by 2025 to help spur economic growth. The figures do not include other migrants like foreign students, which universities rely on to pay high international tuition fees. In 2021, 1.4mn people were in Canada on temporary study or work permits. Immigration accounts for about 75 per cent of Canadas population growth. Most newcomers migrate for economic reasons, and arrive in Canada ready to work or start a business. Some sectors, like healthcare, are facing hiring challenges and depend on immigrants to occupy vacancies at the top and bottom of the pay scale. Immigrants tend to settle in and around major urban centres like Toronto and Vancouver, where rising housing costs present a challenge to those who want enough space for a family, or to have a reasonable commute to their workplace. Rents in major cities soared last year as rising interest rates made it more expensive to buy homes. Source - Financial Times - With input from agencies",

        "date": "January 4, 2023 08:23 pm",
        "content": "Sri Lankas economy, which is projected to register a real contraction of around 8 in 2022, is expected to record a gradual recovery from the second half of 2023 and sustain the growth momentum beyond, the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) says. In a press release titled Monetary and Financial Sector Policies for 2023 and Beyond, the Central Bank laid out the major aspirations of its Monetary Board for regaining the macroeconomic stability in the country. Speaking on the steps taken by the government to ride out the crisis situation, the Central Bank stated that in parallel with the implementation of near-term economic stabilisation measures, negotiations with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for an EFF arrangement were initiated by the government and a staff-level agreement was reached in September 2022. Meanwhile, measures are underway to secure financing assurances from official creditors for the debt restructuring process aimed at ensuring medium term public debt sustainability, the Central Bank said further adding that, with significant progress being made at present in relation to the interaction with the Sri Lankan creditors, the envisaged IMF facility is expected to materialise in early 2023. According to the Central Bank, Sri Lankas headline inflation is expected to move along a disinflationary path with a deceleration in the first half of 2023 and reaching the desired levels of inflation towards the end of 2023. If any upside risks to inflation emerge in the period ahead, that would be addressed through appropriate policy measures. With regard to the monetary policy and interest rates, the Central Bank stated that the monetary policy would remain focused on ensuring stability over the medium term. Meanwhile, the forthcoming Central Banking Act, of which the draft has already been green-lighted by the Cabinet of Ministers, will further strengthen the independence and accountability of the Central Bank, thus reinforcing its core objective of ensuring price stability within the flexible inflation targeting (FIT) framework. The Central Bank went on to note that it would begin publishing a forward-looking monetary policy report to better inform the members of the public on the outlook of the economy, thereby further improving the transparency of monetary policy actions. Meanwhile, the excessively high interest rates observed at present are expected to moderate in the period ahead as money market liquidity conditions improve and the risk premia attached to debt restructuring concern assuage. With regard to the financial sector policies for 2023 and beyond, the Central Bank emphasized that the ensuring system stability also remains at the forefront of its reform and stabilization plan. It stated that the proposed Banking (Special Provisions) Act is expected to provide the required legal framework to ensure that the banks are adequately capitalised, and upgrade their resolution framework, safeguard the interests of depositors, and strengthen the regulatory powers of the Central Bank. The Central Bank pledged to remain committed to achieving its mandate through appropriate policy measures while closely observing developments to take corrective policies and regulatory measures. Appreciating the unwavering support, cooperation, and sacrifice of the financial sector participants, the business community, and the public at this crucial moment of Sri Lankas socioeconomic history, the Central Bank reiterated the need for steadfast commitment to remain focused until the crisis is overcome through collective efforts.

Thai Ly Hao Nam fell into the 25cm (12-inch) wide shaft of the pillar at a construction site while searching for scrap metal. Rescuers in the province of Dong Thap tried to raise the pillar from its 35-metre-deep hole and cut the boy out. Authorities are now working to recover his body for burial. Doan Tan Buu, deputy chief of the southern Vietnam province said there was not enough oxygen for him to survive and that he had suffered multiple injuries. We had prioritised the rescue of the boy. However, the conditions mean it is impossible the boy has survived, he said. The boy was heard crying for help after he fell into the pillar, but rescuers said they received no response from him when they lowered a camera into the shaft on Monday. Vietnamese authorities mobilised hundreds of soldiers and engineering experts to try and rescue him, with the prime minister telling rescuers to use all equipment and forces necessary to save him. They had been removing mud and water in an attempt to bring the pillar up, and oxygen was pumped into the pillar to help the boy breath. Source: BBC",
