The officials were conducting a security check for the passengers who had arrived from Colombo in Chennai on Tuesday night when they intercepted two Sri Lankan passengers on suspicion. The duo, who was visiting Chennai on a tourist visa, appeared nervous and gave evasive replies. When the customs team searched their baggage, they found 20 kg of agarwood and 15 bottles of agar oil in them. As it is illegal to carry agarwood without proper documentation, the Customs officials seized the contraband items. The total value of the seized wood and oil is estimated to be at 4 million Indian rupees. Both passengers were arrested and further inquiry is on, according to the report on DTNext.

The victims, mostly boarders, were burnt alive late on Monday night as the mob set afire Zabir International Hotel owned by district Awami League general secretary Shahin Chakkladar in Joshor district. The dead included an Indonesian national, a local journalist told PTI in Dhaka over phone. He added the doctors at Joshor General Hospital confirmed they counted 24 bodies while surviving hotel staff feared more bodies could be found inside the debris. Media reports suggested unidentified mob, opposed to the Awami League (AL) regime, set the ground floor of the hotel on fire which quickly spread to the upper floors. There were almost identical reports from across the country where the angry mob simultaneously vandalised residences and business establishments of many Awami League leaders and activists, including its central office in Bangabandhu Avenue in the capital. Bangladesh descended into chaos on Monday after Hasina resigned, surreptitiously fled the country and landed in India while the army stepped in to fill the power vacuum.

        "date": "August 7, 2024 04:51 pm",
        "content": "Apples lucrative deal with Google could be under threat after a U.S. judge ruled that the Alphabet-owned search giant was operating an illegal monopoly. A potential remedy for Google to avoid antitrust actions could involve terminating the agreement, which makes its search engine a default on Apple devices, Wall Street analysts said on Tuesday. Google pays Apple 20 billion annually, or about 36 of what it earns from search advertising made through the Safari browser, for the privilege, according to Morgan Stanley analysts. If the deal is undone, the iPhone maker could take a 4-6 hit to its profit, the analysts estimated. The pact runs until at least September 2026 and Apple has the right to unilaterally extend it for another two years, according to media reports in May that cited a document filed by the Department of Justice in the antitrust case. The most likely outcome now is the judge rules Google must no longer pay for default placement or that companies like Apple must proactively prompt users to select their search engine rather than setting a default and allowing consumers to make changes in settings if they wish, Evercore ISI analysts said. Apples shares were trading flat on Tuesday, underperforming a recovery in the broader market after Mondays global selloff. Alphabet was little changed, after falling 4.5 in the previous session. The message here is that if youve got a dominant market position with a product, youd better avoid the use of exclusive agreements and make sure any agreement you make gives the buyer free choice to substitute away, said Herbert Hovenkamp, a professor of law at the University of Pennsylvania. To be sure, the remedy phase could be lengthy, followed by potential appeals to the U.S. Court of Appeals, the District of Columbia Circuit and the U.S. Supreme Court. The legal wrangling could play out into 2026. AI TILT Still, if the tie-up is scrapped, Apple will have several options including offering customers alternatives such as Microsoft Bing to customers, or potentially a new search product powered by OpenAI. Analysts agree that the ruling will speed up Apples move towards AI-powered search services. It recently announced that it would bring OpenAIs ChatGPT chatbot to its devices. In a shift away from exclusive deals that would help Apple ward off regulatory scrutiny, the company has said it is also in talks with Google to add the Gemini chatbot and plans to add other AI models as well. Apple is also revamping Siri with AI technology, giving it more control to handle tasks that had proven tricky in the past such as writing emails and interacting with messages. While those efforts are expected to make little money in the coming years, they could help capitalize on the new technology. Apple could see this as a temporary setback, especially since it earns a lot from the Google search deal, but it is also an opportunity for them to pivot to AI solutions for search, said Gadjo Sevilla, analyst at Emarketer.

        "content": "A helicopter crashed in central Nepal on Wednesday, killing all five people aboard including the pilot and four Chinese tourists. Nepal has a woeful track record on aviation safety and the Himalayan republic has seen a spate of deadly light plane and helicopter crashes over the decades. The Air Dynasty chopper was heading to Syabrubesi, a starting point for many trekking routes popular with tourists, from the capital Kathmandu. It lost contact about three minutes after taking off, a press release from the Civil Aviation Authority said, and crashed in Nuwakot district north of the capital. Another helicopter was dispatched immediately to the accident site for rescue, it said. All five people aboard including the pilot are dead, police spokesman Dan Bahadur Karki told AFP. Nuwakot district officer Ram Krishna Adhikari said five dead bodies have been retrieved from the accident site. It has crashed in a jungle area on the slope of a hill. We do not know the cause yet or how it happened, he said from the crash site. Adhikari said that police and army personnel were dispatched after locals had alerted him about the crash and a fire at the site. Nepals air industry has boomed in recent years, carrying goods and people between hard-to-reach areas as well as foreign trekkers and climbers. But it has been plagued by poor safety due to insufficient training and maintenance, issues compounded by mountainous Nepals treacherous geography. The Himalayan republic has some of the worlds most remote and tricky runways, flanked by snow-capped peaks with approaches that pose a challenge even for accomplished pilots. The European Union has banned all Nepali carriers from its airspace over safety concerns. Wednesdays incident comes two weeks after a plane crash in Kathmandu killed all 18 aboard except the pilot. Six people, including five members of a Mexican family, were killed when a helicopter crashed soon after take-off in the Everest region in 2023. Nepals tourism minister Rabindra Adhikari was among seven killed in a helicopter crash in 2019. The countrys last major incident involving a commercial flight was in January 2023 when a Yeti Airlines service crashed while landing at Pokhara, killing all 72 aboard. That was Nepals deadliest since 1992 when all 167 people aboard a Pakistan International Airlines plane were killed when it crashed on approach to Kathmandu airport. A Thai Airways aircraft crashed near the same airport earlier that year, killing 113 people. Source: AFP --Agencies",

        "date": "August 8, 2024 02:45 pm",
        "content": "Taylor Swifts three concerts in Vienna this week were cancelled after the government confirmed a planned attack at the stadium, the organizer announced late on Wednesday, and Austrias Chancellor Karl Nehammer said a tragedy was prevented. Thanks to the intensive cooperation of our police and the newly established DSN with foreign services, the threat was identified early on, combated and a tragedy prevented, Nehammer said in a post on social media platform X. DSN is Austrias Directorate for Security and Intelligence. With confirmation from government officials of a planned terrorist attack at Ernst Happel Stadium, we have no choice but to cancel the three scheduled shows for everyones safety, Barracuda.music said in a post on Instagram, adding all tickets would be automatically refunded. Austrian police on Wednesday detained two people suspected of plotting attacks on concerts, Franz Ruf, director general for public security, said at a news conference on Wednesday evening. During our investigations, we identified preparatory actions and noted that the 19 year-old suspect had a particular focus on the Taylor Swift concerts in Vienna, Ruf said, adding that the suspect, an Austrian citizen, had pledged allegiance to Islamic state. Another suspect was later arrested in Vienna. Police searched the residence of one of the suspects in Ternitz, Lower Austria, and were analysing items from the home. Local media, citing police sources, said three suspects were still on the run. Earlier on Wednesday before the cancellation announcement, police had said the events would take place but with increased entry checks and personal searches, with deployment of special units including anti-terror and bomb disposal teams, advising the public to arrive early at the events. Three Taylor Swift concerts were scheduled to take place In Vienna from Thursday to Saturday. Police had been expecting around 65,000 attendees at each show, as well as up to 15,000 people outside the stadium without tickets, which fed security concerns. The shows were to be part of the record-breaking Eras Tour by the American singer-songwriter which started on March 17, 2023, in Glendale, Arizona, U.S., and is set to conclude on Dec. 8, 2024, in Vancouver, Canada. Swift, 34, has not yet commented on the cancellations on her official Instagram account which has 283 million followers. The singer has been taking Europe by storm, prompting some pundits to envisage an economic windfall as fans flock to dozens of sold-out shows from Dublin to Warsaw and beyond. After Vienna, Swift was set to sing in London where six concerts are scheduled at Wembley Stadium, starting on Aug. 15. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "date": "August 8, 2024 02:55 pm",
        "content": "A powerful earthquake struck off Japans southern coast on Thursday, triggering a tsunami advisory. Residents were urged to stay away from the coastline, but there were no immediate reports of injuries or serious damage. The Japan Meteorological Agency said the quake registered magnitude 7.1 and was centered in waters off the eastern coast of Japans southern main island of Kyushu at a depth of about 30 kilometers (18.6 miles). The quake most strongly shook Nichinan city and nearby areas in Miyazaki prefecture on Kyushu island. The agency said tsunami waves of up 50 centimeters (1.6 feet) were detected along parts of Kyushus southern coast and the nearby island of Shikoku about a half hour after the quake struck. Seismologists were holding an emergency meeting to analyze whether the quake had affected the nearby Nankai Trough, the source of past devastating earthquakes. Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi said officials were assessing possible injuries or serious damage, though none were immediately reported. He urged residents of the affected region to stay away from the coastline. Japans NHK public television said there were reports of broken windows at the Miyazaki airport near the epicenter. The Nuclear Regulation Authority said all 12 nuclear reactors, including three which are currently operating, on Kyushu and Shikoku remained safe. Earthquakes in areas with nuclear power plants have been a major concern since a massive earthquake and tsunami in March 2011 triggered the Fukushima nuclear disaster. Japan sits on the Pacific Ring of Fire, the line of seismic faults encircling the Pacific Ocean, and is one of the worlds most earthquake-prone countries. An earthquake on Jan. 1 in Japans north-central region of Noto left more than 240 people dead. Source: AP --Agencies",

        "content": "Former Health Minister Keheliya Rambukwella and 03 other suspects implicated in the alleged importation of substandard immunoglobulin vials have been further remanded until August 22. The order was issued after the defendants were produced before the Maligakanda Magistrates Court today (08). Meanwhile, former Health Secretary Janaka Chandraguptha and former Additional Health Secretary, who were also in remand custody, have been granted bail by the court. The Criminal Investigation Department (CID) arrested Rambukwella on 02 February over his alleged complicity in the procurement of substandard IVIG vials. The arrest came hot on the heels of pressure from civil society activists and health sector trade unionists, who called for the immediate apprehension of the lawmaker. In October 2023, the National Medicines Regulatory Authority (NMRA) revealed that forged documents were found to have been submitted for Customs clearance to procure a batch of vials containing human immunoglobulin, an antibody produced by blood plasma cells, which later failed the quality tests. Prior to the apprehension of Rambukwella, seven arrests had been made in connection with the drug procurement scam. But the fifth accused was later released on bail. As such, the former Health Secretary, former Additional Health Secretary, the Director of the Health Ministrys Medical Supplies Division (MSD) and three other officials of the same division, as well as the owner of the company, which is said to have supplied the substandard batch of immunoglobulin vials, were arrested and remanded over the case. Meanwhile, one of the suspects in the case, former Deputy Director of the Medical Supplies Division of the Health Ministry, Dr. Thusitha Sudarshana, was released on bail when the case was previously taken up on May 06. Meanwhile, the Court of Appeal on July 25 ordered the Maligakanda Magistrates Court to release on bail the former Director of the Health Ministrys Medical Supplies Division, Dr. Kapila Wickramanayake, who was also in remand custody.",

        "date": "August 8, 2024 04:54 pm",
        "content": "Bangladeshs next leader Muhammad Yunus arrived home Thursday from an overseas trip and will take office later in the day, as he looks to restore calm and rebuild the country following an uprising that ended the 15-year, increasingly autocratic rule of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. Yunus landed at Dhakas Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport on Thursday afternoon and was welcomed by the countrys military chief, Gen. Waker-Uz-Zaman, who was flanked by navy and air force heads. Some of the student leaders who led the uprising against Hasina were also present at the airport to welcome him. They had earlier proposed Yunus as interim leader to the countrys figurehead president, who is currently acting as the chief executive under the constitution. In his first comments after his arrival, he told a news briefing that his priority would be to restore order. Bangladesh is a family. We have to unite it, Yunus said, flanked by the student leaders. It has immense possibility. He urged all to stop violence and promised not to resort to any repressive measures against anyone. Security was tight at the airport to ensure Yunus safe arrival, as the country has experienced days of unrest following the downfall of Hasina on Monday. President Mohammed Shahabuddin will administer the oath-taking ceremony on Thursday night when Yunus is expected to announce his new Cabinet. Before leaving Paris, where he was attending the Olympics, Yunus appealed for calm in Bangladesh amid tensions over the countrys future. Hasinas son Sajeeb Wazed Joy, who acts as an adviser to his mother, vowed Wednesday that his family and the Awami League party would continue to be engaged in Bangladeshs politics  a reversal from what hed said earlier in the week after Hasina stepped down Monday and fled to India. Yunuswas named as interim leader following talks among military officials, civic leaders and the student activists who led the uprising against Hasina. Yunus made his first public comments in the French capital on Wednesday before boarding a plane to return home. Yunus congratulated the student protesters, saying they had made our second Victory Day possible, and he appealed to them and other stakeholders to remain peaceful, while condemning the violence that followed Hasinas resignation. Violence is our enemy. Please dont create more enemies. Be calm and get ready to build the country, Yunus said. Bangladeshs military chief, Gen. Waker-Uz-Zaman, said in a televised address on Wednesday that he expected Yunus to usher in a beautiful democratic process. Yunus, who was awarded the 2006 Nobel Peace Prize for his work developing microcredit markets, told reporters in Paris: Im looking forward to going back home and seeing whats happening there, and how we can organize ourselves to get out of the trouble that we are in. Asked when elections would be held, he put his hands up as if to indicate it was too early to say. Ill go and talk to them. Im just fresh in this whole area, he said. A tribunal in Dhaka earlier on Wednesday acquitted Yunus in a labor law violation case involving a telecommunication company he founded, in which he was convicted and sentenced to six months in jail. He had been released on bail in the case. The president had dissolved Parliament on Tuesday, clearing the path for an interim administration that is expected to schedule new elections. Yunus has been a longtime opponent of Hasina, who had called him a bloodsucker allegedly for using force to extract loan repayments from rural poor, mainly women. Yunus has denied the allegations. In a span of weeks since July 15, more than 300 people died in violence in Bangladesh. Rising tensions in the days surrounding Hasinas resignation created chaos, with police leaving their posts after being attacked. Dozens of officers were killed, prompting police to stop working across the country. They threatened not to return unless their safety is ensured. The looting of firearms was also reported in local media. The chaos began in July with protests against a quota system for government jobs that critics said favored people with connections to Hasinas party. But the demonstrations soon grew into a broader challenge to Hasinas 15-year rule, which was marked by human rights abuses, corruption, allegations of rigged elections and a brutal crackdown on her opponents. Joy, Hasinas son, said in a social media post on Wednesday that his family would return to politics and not give up following attacks on the Awami League partys leaders and members. Many see Joy as Hasinas successor in a dynastic political culture that dominates the South Asian nations politics. On Monday, Joy had said Hasina would not return to politics after she stepped down. But in a video message posted on his Facebook page on Wednesday, he urged party activists to rise up. You are not alone. We are here. The family of Bangabandhu has not gone anywhere, he said. Hasinas father, independence leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, is fondly referred to in Bangladesh as Bangabandhu, which means friend of Bengal. If we want to build a new Bangladesh, it is not possible without the Awami League, he said. The Awami League is the oldest, democratic, and largest party in Bangladesh, Joy added. The Awami League has not died ... It is not possible to eliminate the Awami League. We had said that our family would not engage in politics anymore. However, given the attacks on our leaders and activists, we cannot give up. Overnight into Thursday, residents across Dhaka carried sticks, iron rods and sharp weapons to guard their neighborhoods amid reports of robberies. Communities used loudspeakers in mosques to alert people that robberies were occurring, as police remained off duty. The military shared hotline numbers for people seeking help. The quick move to select Yunus came when Hasinas resignation created a power vacuum and left the future unclear for Bangladesh, which has a history of military rule, messy politics and myriad crises. Many fear that Hasinas departure could trigger even more instability in the densely populated nation of some 170 million people, which is already dealing with high unemployment, corruption and a complex strategic relationship with India, China and the United States. Hasina, 76, was elected to a fourth consecutive term in January, in an election boycotted by her main opponents. Thousands of opposition members were jailed before the vote, and the U.S. and U.K. denounced the result as not credible. Source: AP --Agencies",

        "date": "August 8, 2024 05:01 pm",
        "content": "(Reuters) - Russian internet monitoring services reported a mass outage on the availability of video hosting site YouTube on Thursday as Russian authorities step up criticism of the platform. Russian internet monitoring service Sboi.rf said there had been thousands of glitches reported about YouTube in Russia. Users said they could only access YouTube via virtual private networks (VPNs). YouTube is not working, one anonymous user said in comments on the site. Reuters reporters in Russia were unable to access YouTube. The website remained available via some mobile devices. Google did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Thursday. Russias state communications watchdog Roskomnadzor also did not immediately reply to a request for comment. YouTube is one of the last major bastions of free expression on the Russian internet, where the site continues to host materials by Kremlin opponents that have been largely removed from other social media sites popular in Russia. The sites download speeds have notably slowed in recent weeks, for which Russian lawmakers have blamed YouTube owner Alphabets Google, something the company disputes. Alexander Khinshtein, head of a parliamentary committee on information policy, warned last month that YouTube speeds would drop by as much as 70. He said the degradation was a necessary step, directed not against Russian users, but against the administration of a foreign resource that still believes it can violate and ignore our legislation without punishment. Khinshtein later explicitly blamed the slowdown on Googles failure to invest in Russian infrastructure, such as its local cache servers, something YouTube rejected. A YouTube spokesperson said last week it was aware of reports that some people were unable to access YouTube in Russia. This was not because of any actions on technical issues on its part, it said.

        "date": "August 8, 2024 08:48 pm",
        "content": "Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) has raised concerns over the safety of its Test team ahead of the three-match series against England, starting on August 21 in Manchester, due to anti-immigrant riots that have erupted in various cities of the United Kingdom. According to a report in ESPNCricinfo, the Sri Lankan players already in England - seven players and two support staff - have asked the countrys cricket board to arrange for better security over the next few days, as they travel to and from a ground near London, due to the widespread riots targeting immigrants in the UK. The riots in the UK have taken place after a mass stabbing incident in Southport, where three children were killed. Due to disinformation about the attackers, many immigrants, as well as their businesses and places of worship, have come under attack from far-right groups. Most of the issues seem not to be close to where we are but everyone is still a little concerned. We cant really go out to dinner or do anything like that. Mostly we stay in the hotel. No one wants to run into trouble and get beaten up. Weve asked the board to try and ask for some security for us until the main team arrives, but we havent heard anything back yet, a Sri Lanka player was quoted as saying in the report. The majority of the Test team will arrive in England on Sunday, and from there, the security plan of the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) begins. The report added that the ECB has responded by reassuring SLC and the team about the security arrangements in place. I raised the issue with them, but the ECB responded very quickly and sent us their comprehensive security arrangements. Well be having a security liaison on the tour from them as well, Sri Lankas team manager Mahinda Halangoda was quoted as saying in the report. It also said the United Kingdom government, in an emergency call on Wednesday, has assured sporting bodies that the country remained safe for conducting sporting activities, with the police stating it will crack down on people who indulge in violence. After the first Test ends at Manchester, Sri Lanka and England will play two more games at the Lords, beginning on August 29, and at The Oval, commencing on September 6. Source: IANS --Agencies",

        "title": "Interim leader Muhammad Yunus takes helm in Bangladesh, to seek peace and prepare elections",
        "date": "August 8, 2024 09:43 pm",
        "content": "Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus took the oath of office as head of Bangladeshs interim government Thursday after an uprising prompted former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina to step down and flee to India. The key tasks for Yunus now are restoring peace in Bangladesh and preparing for new elections following weeks of violence in which student activists led an uprising against what was considered Hasinas increasingly autocratic 15-year rule. Bangladeshs figurehead President Mohammed Shahabuddin administered the oath to Yunus for his role as chief advisor, which is the equivalent to a prime minister, in presence of foreign diplomats, civil society members, top businessmen and members of the former opposition party at the presidential palace in Dhaka. No representatives of Hasinas party were present. Sixteen other people have been included in the interim Cabinet with members drawn mainly from civil society and including two of the student protest leaders. The Cabinet members Yunus as interim leader were chosen in discussions this week among student leaders, civil society representatives and the military. Hasina quit on Monday after several chaotic weeks that began in July with protests against a quota system for government jobs that critics said favored people with connections to Hasinas party. But the demonstrations soon grew into a bigger challenge for Hasinas 15-year rule as more than 300 people including students were killed amid spiraling violence. Yunus, who was awarded the 2006 Nobel Peace Prize for his work developing microcredit markets, was in the French capital for the 2024 Olympics when he was chosen for the interim role, and returned home earlier Thursday to tight security at the airport in Dhaka. In his first comments after his arrival, he told a news briefing that his priority would be to restore order. Bangladesh is a family. We have to unite it, Yunus said, flanked by student leaders. It has immense possibility. On Wednesday in Paris, Yunus had called for calm and an end to all partisan violence. Hasinas son Sajeeb Wazed Joy, who acts as an adviser to his mother, vowed Wednesday that his family and the Awami League party would continue to be engaged in Bangladeshs politics  a reversal from what hed said earlier in the week after Hasina stepped down Monday and fled to India. The president had dissolved Parliament on Tuesday, clearing the path for the interim administration. On Wednesday, a tribunal in Dhaka acquitted Yunus in a labor law violation case involving a telecommunication company he founded, in which he was convicted and sentenced to six months in jail. He had been released on bail in the case. Yunus has been a longtime opponent of Hasina, who had called him a bloodsucker allegedly for using force to extract loan repayments from rural poor, mainly women. Yunus has denied the allegations. The chaos on Bangladeshs streets continued after Hasinas resignation on Monday. Dozens of police officers were killed, prompting police to stop working across the country. They threatened not to return unless their safety is ensured. The looting of firearms also was reported in local media. The unrest began in mid-July with protests over the quota system, but grew into a broader challenge over an administration that was marked by human rights abuses, corruption, allegations of rigged elections and a brutal crackdown on her opponents. Joy, Hasinas son, said in a social media post on Wednesday that his family would return to politics despite what he said have been attacks on Hasinas Awami League party over the past week. Many observers see Joy as Hasinas successor in a dynastic political culture that dominates the South Asian nations politics. If we want to build a new Bangladesh, it is not possible without the Awami League, he said. The Awami League is the oldest, democratic, and largest party in Bangladesh.

        "title": "Venezuelas Maduro blocks X access in country for 10 days",
        "date": "August 9, 2024 08:37 am",
        "content": "Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro on Thursday took tensions with social media platform X and its owner Elon Musk to new heights, banning the platform in the South American country for 10 days amid furore over a disputed presidential election. Maduro said he signed a resolution presented by regulator Conatel which has decided to take social network X, formerly known as Twitter, out of circulation for 10 days and accused Musk of inciting hate, civil war, and death. X get out of Venezuela for 10 days! he said in a speech which was broadcast on state television. Maduro and Musk have frequently traded barbs over X, with the platforms owner comparing the Venezuelan president to a donkey, while Maduro has blamed Musk for being a driving force behind protests and dissent following the election. They have also offered and accepted challenges to fight each other in comments on X and via Venezuelan state television. The temporary ban on X represents another swipe at Big Tech, after Maduro this week urged supporters to abandon Meta-owned WhatsApp in favor of Telegram or WeChat, saying the messaging app was being used to threaten the families of soldiers and police officers. WhatsApp declined to comment. X did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Venezuelas electoral authority proclaimed Maduro the winner of the July 28 presidential election with some 51 of the vote, although it has yet to produce the voting tallies. The declaration sparked widespread accusations of fraud and protests which were promoted across social media. Local advocacy group the Venezuelan Observatory for Social Conflict reports at least 23 people have been killed in protests. In the days after the vote, protests from Venezuelans across the country and abroad broke out demanding Maduro step down and to honor a win by opposition candidate Edmundo Gonzalez. The opposition, led by Maria Corina Machado and Gonzalez, says it has copies of the voting tallies that show it won the election with more than 7 million votes, compared to Maduros 3.3 million votes. That result is broadly similar to that predicted by independent exit polls. Countries including the U.S, Argentina and Chile have refused to recognize Maduros claimed victory, instead urging transparency and the publication of the voting tallies. China and Russia have congratulated Maduro on his victory. Venezuelan security forces have launched a crackdown on what authorities say are violent criminals, with Maduro touting more than 2,000 arrests. Advocacy groups say those arrested are peaceful demonstrators being targeted for repression. The voices of Venezuelan voters will not be silenced by repression, censorship, or disinformation. The world is watching, Brian A. Nichols, Assistant Secretary for Western Hemisphere Affairs for the U.S State Department, said in a post on X. Earlier, the foreign ministers of Mexico, Colombia and Brazil reiterated calls for Venezuelas electoral authority to publish the vote tallies in a joint statement. The statement followed comments Machado on Thursday, who called on Mexicos President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador to impress upon Maduro that his best option is to negotiate with the countrys opposition.

        "title": "Debate showdown between Trump and Harris set for September",
        "date": "August 9, 2024 09:29 am",
        "content": "ABC News has said it will host the first debate between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris on 10 September. The network confirmed the showdown in a post on X, formerly Twitter, after Trump said on Thursday that he would be open to debating his Democratic rival multiple times before the November election. We think we should do three debates, Trump said, suggesting two additional debates that he said would be hosted by Fox News and NBC, respectively. Ms Harris confirmed that she will attend the ABC debate while at an event in Michigan on Thursday, and said later that she would be open to additional debates. The network said the debate will be moderated by World News Tonight anchor and managing editor David Muir and ABC News Live Prime anchor Linsey Davis. I am looking forward to debating Donald Trump and we have a date of September 10. I hear hes finally committed to it and Im looking forward to it, Ms Harris said at the event in Detroit. Trump, the Republican candidate, debated President Joe Biden once in June. The two were slated to do so again on 10 September but Mr Biden withdrew from the presidential race after a disastrous performance against Trump in the televised matchup. That paved the way for Ms Harris to become the Democratic nominee. The confirmation of the debate on ABC marks an end to a back-and-forth that followed Mr Bidens decision to leave the race between the Trump and Harris campaigns over that planned showdown. Trump had previously said that he wanted a debate hosted by the conservative network Fox News, saying it would take place in Pennsylvania, at a site in an area to be determined. The Harris campaign had maintained they would still like to debate Trump on 10 September. At a news conference on Thursday at his Mar-a-Lago resort, Trump also said he would like to debate Ms Harris two additional times - on 4 September on Fox News and on 25 September on NBC. Trump said that CBS will host a debate between the two vice-presidential nominees, Republican JD Vance and Democratic Tim Walz. NBC News is reportedly in discussions with both campaigns about a potential debate this autumn, the New York Times reported. Fox News said it sent formal letters to both campaigns last month proposing a September debate in Pennsylvania, though the Harris campaign said on Thursday that Trump has to show up to the ABC debate before they confirm any further showdowns. Trump also criticised Ms Harris for not taking reporter questions or doing an interview since she became the likely Democratic nominee just over two weeks ago. He called her barely competent and criticised her intelligence. Later on Thursday, Ms Harris told reporters that she has asked her team to get an interview scheduled before the end of the month. Trumps hour-long event was held amid reports that his campaign is feeling the pressure from Democrats, who have new enthusiasm under Ms Harris and have been dominating headlines. National and battleground state polls suggest her campaign has gained ground in recent days, though the race for the White House remains a close contest. The former president denied he had recalibrated his campaign to challenge Ms Harris instead of Mr Biden, and he appeared to prickle when asked about the audience Ms Harris draws at rallies. Oh, give me a break, he said, arguing that crowds at his rallies were larger than at hers. His Thursday news conference is the first he has held in several months, as his campaign has previously focused on holding rallies across the country. Trump also praised his running mate Mr Vance, who was recently under fire for comments he made in 2021 when he said those without children shouldnt be leading the country and that women who dont have children are miserable and childless cat ladies. I have to tell you, JD Vance has really stepped up, Trump said. Hes doing a fantastic job. He took aim at Ms Harris track record on immigration and the economy. And he repeated his belief that US presidents should have a say over interest rates and monetary policy - a departure from the longstanding practice of having the US Federal Reserve, an independent body, oversee these matters. He emphasised his priorities of lowering inflation, lowering crime rates and strengthening the military. Ms Harris on Thursday addressed United Auto Workers in Detroit, and thanked the union for endorsing her. She said there are 89 days to get this done ahead of the election. Source: BBC --Agencies",

        "content": "The Supreme Court has ruled that the decision taken by Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) to suspend the party membership of Ministers Manush Nanayakkara and Harin Fernando was lawful. The court issued this verdict while dismissing a petition filed by the two ministers seeking an order declaring that the SJBs decision to remove them from the party is unlawful. The decision was announced by the three-member Supreme Court bench consisting of Justices Vijith Malalgoda, Achala Vengappuli and Arjuna Obeysekara this morning (09). On July 18, 2023, the Working Committee of the SJB decided to expel party members Harin Fernando and Manusha Nanayakkara from the party. In May 2022, the SJB had suspended the party membership of the two parliamentarians after they had accepted ministerial portfolios in the government while the party had vowed to take disciplinary action against them. MPs Harin Fernando and Manusha Nanayakkara were sworn in as the Minister of Tourism  Lands and Minister of Labour  Foreign Employment, respectively whereas Minister Fernando was also appointed as the Sports Minister. Fernando and Nanayakkara had said they accepted ministerial portfolios in the government under President Gotabaya Rajapaksa to do their utmost to find solutions to the ongoing economic crisis as a positive response was not received from many political party leaders for a collective effort. They both subsequently resigned from their ministerial portfolios on July 9, 2022 along with the rest of the Cabinet, after then President Gotabaya Rajapaksa informed the Speaker of Parliament that he intends to resign. However, they were both reappointed to the same ministerial portfolios by President Ranil Wickremesinghe when he appointed a new Cabinet on July 22, 2022.",

Accordingly, the recommendations made by the relevant commission against a group of individuals including Presidents Secretary Saman Ekanayake, former Deputy Inspector General (DIG) of the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) Ravi Seneviratne and its former Director Shani Abeysekara were ordered to be annulled, when petitions filed pertaining to the matter were taken up this morning (09).

The Presidential Commission of Inquiry to Investigate Allegations of Political Victimization was appointed by former President Gotabhaya Rajapaksa and was led by retired Supreme Court Judge Upali Abeyratne. A three-member Presidential Commission of Inquiry was appointed by President Gotabaya Rajapaksa in January 2020, to inquire into alleged political victimizations that have taken place from 2015 to 2019. The Commission consisted of retired Supreme Court Judge Upali Abeyratne, retired Court of Appeal Judge Daya Chandrasiri Jayatilake, and retired IGP Chandra Fernando. Its members were entrusted with the task of inquiring into political victimization and associated background which had taken place in the wake of investigations conducted by the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption, FCID, CID, and the Special Investigation Unit of the Police from January 8, 2015, to November 16, 2019.

        "date": "August 9, 2024 11:07 am",
        "content": "Microsoft researchers said on Friday that Iran government-tied hackers tried breaking into the account of a high-ranking official on the U.S. presidential campaign in June, weeks after breaching the account of a county-level U.S. official. The breaches were part of Iranian groups increasing attempts to influence the U.S. presidential election in November, the researchers said in a report that did not provide any further detail on the official in question. The report follows recent statements by senior U.S. Intelligence officials that theyd seen Iran ramp up use of clandestine social media accounts with the aim to use them to try to sow political discord in the United States. Irans mission to the United Nations in New York told Reuters in a statement that its cyber capabilities were defensive and proportionate to the threats it faces and that it had no plans to launch cyber-attacks. The U.S. presidential election is an internal matter in which Iran does not interfere, the mission added in response to the allegations in the Microsoft report. A group run by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) intelligence unit sent a spear-phishing email to a high-ranking official of a presidential campaign and another group with assessed links to the IRGC compromised a user account with minimal access permissions at a county-level government, the report said. It said the activity appeared part of a broader push by Iranian groups to gain intelligence on U.S. political campaigns and target U.S. swing states. It said the county employees account was breached in May as part of a wider password spray operation - one where hackers use common or leaked passwords en masse on many accounts until they can break into one. The hackers werent able to access any other accounts through that breach and the targets were notified, the report added. The researchers also said another Iranian group had been launching covert news sites that used artificial intelligence to lift content from legitimate news sites, and targeted U.S. voters on opposite sides of the political spectrum. It named the two sites as Nio Thinker -- a left-leaning site -- and a conservative site called Savannah Time. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "date": "August 9, 2024 11:50 am",
        "content": "The High Commissioner of Sri Lanka to the Maldives Ranga Goonawardana recently held a meeting with the Minister of Education of Maldives Dr. Ismail Shafeeu to explore ways to enhance educational collaboration between the two nations. The discussions underscored the significance of leveraging the shared history and cultural ties between Sri Lanka and Maldives to foster mutual growth and understanding, particularly in the education sector, the High Commission of Sri Lanka in Malé said in a statement. The meeting focused on expanding opportunities for Sri Lankan teachers to contribute to the education system in Maldives. Over the years, Sri Lankan educators have played a crucial role in shaping the academic landscape of Maldives, earning widespread respect and recognition for their dedication and expertise, it added. Minister Shafeeu acknowledged this legacy and highlighted that many of Maldives senior leaders and professionals were educated by Sri Lankan teachers. He expressed his deep appreciation for the positive impact these teachers have had on the development of the nation. Minister Shafeeu also expressed concerns about the recent decline in the number of Sri Lankan teachers employed in the Maldivian schools. He noted that this trend could diminish the strong educational ties between the two countries. The Minister emphasized the importance of reversing this decline to ensure that future generations of Maldivian students can benefit from the high-quality education provided by Sri Lankan teachers, the statement highlighted. High Commissioner Goonawardana reiterated the commitment of the Sri Lankan government to supporting the Maldivian education sector. He requested the Maldivian Ministry of Education to consider increasing the recruitment of Sri Lankan teachers, acknowledging the potential benefits for both nations. The High Commissioner emphasized that this initiative would address the current shortfall and strengthens the longstanding friendship and cooperation between Sri Lanka and Maldives. During the meeting, beyond the recruitment of teachers, both parties discussed the broader context of educational collaboration. They explored the possibility of establishing student exchange programs that would allow young people from both countries to gain exposure to different educational environments, cultures, and perspectives. They agreed that such programmes could play a significant role in building lasting relationships and fostering mutual understanding between the next generation of Sri Lankans and Maldivians. High Commissioner Goonawardana expressed his enthusiasm for these initiatives and noted that educational exchanges could significantly contribute to the socio-cultural and intellectual development of students from both nations. Moreover, he highlighted that they would serve as ambassadors of goodwill and cooperation in the future. The meeting concluded with a solid pledge to improve the role of Sri Lankan teachers within the Maldivian education system. They agreed to continue working closely to ensure the legacy of educational cooperation between Sri Lanka and Maldives is preserved and strengthened in the future, according to the Sri Lankan High Commission.",

The relevant decision was scheduled to be delivered today (09). However, the Appeals Court judge bench comprising President of the Court of Appeal Nissanka Bandula Karunaratne and Justice Shashi Mahendran ordered the relevant decision on whether to grant leave to proceed with the petition to be issued on September 04, 2024. The Criminal Investigation Department (CID) arrested Rambukwella on 02 February over his alleged complicity in the procurement of substandard IVIG vials. The arrest came hot on the heels of pressure from civil society activists and health sector trade unionists, who called for the immediate apprehension of the lawmaker. In October 2023, the National Medicines Regulatory Authority (NMRA) revealed that forged documents were found to have been submitted for Customs clearance to procure a batch of vials containing human immunoglobulin, an antibody produced by blood plasma cells, which later failed the quality tests.",

Hasina fled to neighbouring India on Monday after weeks of deadly protests forced her to quit. A caretaker government led by Nobel Peace laureate Muhammad Yunus was sworn in on Thursday, which will be tasked with holding elections. Speaking to the Times of India daily, her son Sajeeb Wazed Joy, who is based in the U.S., said, For the time being, she (Hasina) is in India. She will go back to Bangladesh the moment the interim government decides to hold an election. He did not specify whether Hasina, 76, will contest elections. My mother would have retired from politics after the current term, Joy said. I never had any political ambition and was settled in the US. But the developments in the Bangladesh in the past few days show that there is a leadership vacuum. I had to get active for the sake of the party and I am at the forefront now, he told the newspaper. Hasinas Awami League party does not feature in the interim government, following a student-led uprising against the long-time former prime minister whose exit came after nationwide violence killed about 300 people and injured thousands. She is sheltering in a safe house in the New Delhi area. Indian media has reported that she plans to seek asylum in Britain, but the British Home Office has declined to comment.

The additional funding was announced during a visit to Sri Lanka by the U.S. Agency for International Developments (USAID) Assistant Administrator of the Bureau for Asia Michael Schiffer at an event held at the Ministry of Finance. USAID Sri Lanka and Maldives Mission Director Gabriel Grau also participated in Fridays ceremony alongside State Minister of Finance Shehan Semasinghe, the US Embassy in Colombo said. The funds, committed through a Development Objective Grant Agreement between USAID and the government of Sri Lanka, will strengthen Sri Lankas market-driven growth, foster environmental sustainability and resilience, and promote good governance practices. As a result of our partnerships across government, non-governmental organizations, and civil society, the funds support collaborative efforts that are making a positive difference in the lives of Sri Lankans, it added. U.S. Ambassador to Sri Lanka Julie Chung underscored the continued commitment of the American people to investing in economic growth and good governance with this additional funding: Since 1956, the United States has invested in Sri Lankas people, empowering them in their entrepreneurial pursuits, strengthening Sri Lankas resilience to climate change and macro-economic shocks, and enriching lives across the country. This additional funding demonstrates our steadfast commitment to working with local partners in Sri Lanka. Together, we are building a foundation for lasting stability and prosperity for communities across the country. The United States and the American people are proud of our longstanding partnership with Sri Lanka and its people, USAID Assistant Administrator for Bureau of Asia Schiffer said. This funding is an investment to further support the countrys locally led initiatives to drive sustainable solutions for Sri Lankas development challenges. The United States has provided more than US 2 billion (Rs. 598 billion) in assistance to Sri Lanka since 1956 to support Sri Lankas agriculture, education, health, environment, water, sanitation, infrastructure, governance, and business development and provide humanitarian assistance to people in need. Over the last seven decades, U.S. support has helped modernize Sri Lankas diesel coaches, supported its Thriposha supplemental nutrition program, supported the development of electric vehicle charging stations, and empowered women entrepreneurs to drive economic growth.",

        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe stated that he chose to run as an independent candidate in the upcoming Presidential Election, free from any party affiliation, to address the nations hunger crisis. He emphasized that the peoples suffering transcends party lines and political colours. The President made these remarks during the Kantha Ape Balaya womens conference held in Colombo today (09). During the conference, the President further vowed to uphold and protect womens rights, ensuring they are equal to the rights enjoyed by men in the country. Meanwhile, Minister Pavithra Wanniarachchi, who also addressed the event, said that Bangladesh is facing the current predicament because they did not have a leader like Ranil Wickremesinghe to step up and take charge. Sri Lanka averted such a dire situation because we had a courageous leader like Ranil Wickremesinghe, said the Minister. Meanwhile, Minister Wanniarachchi yesterday (08) announced that she had decided to support President Ranil Wickremesinghe, who is contesting the upcoming Presidential Election as an independent candidate. She had stated that she reached this decision based on the requests of the majority of Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) members and supporters in the Ratnapura District. President Ranil Wickremesinghe said: Some people ask me why I am running as a non-partisan candidate in this years presidential election. The truth is, hunger is not political. Regardless of party affiliation, everyone experiences hunger. Therefore, we must set aside our political differences and unite to address the needs of our people. I understand the struggles faced by our citizens, who have endured significant hardships without electricity, fuel, or food, all while trying to send their children to school. We cannot allow this situation to happen again, and it is essential that we work together to prevent it. I became President because others shied away from their responsibilities. After taking office, I reached out to Mr. Sajith Premadasa and Mr. Anura Dissanayake, asking them to join me in rescuing the people from these challenges, but they declined to support our efforts to improve the economy. In that moment, three women stepped up to help me: Indias Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, and International Monetary Fund Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva. While some who spoke of patriotism and claimed to understand the peoples suffering turned away, these three women from other countries offered their support to help us move forward. Without their assistance, we would not be where we are today. Additionally, when our country faced a shortage of fertilizer, Mrs. Samantha Power from the U.S. came to our aid. Thanks to her help, we succeeded in the Yala season and made strides in reviving our economy. We should express our gratitude to these women. Many who claim to be great patriots and experienced leaders failed to take responsibility for our country. We have come a long way with great effort, but we must continue to push forward. There is no need to dwell on the suffering we have all endured. Let me provide a clear example. In 2021, the value of gold pledged by commercial banks was Rs. 250 billion, but today it has surpassed Rs. 500 billion. We worked to provide relief in this area. Many households saw elders skip meals, and others struggled to afford a quality education for their children. The relief we are experiencing today is due to the support provided by the International Monetary Fund, specifically from Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva, as well as assistance from Janet Yellen and Nirmala Sitharaman. Their help has enabled us to move forward strongly. We have signed agreements with the International Monetary Fund and several countries that provide us with loans. The conditions we agreed upon are included in the Economic Transformation Law. If we continue on this path, we have the potential to recover as a nation. However, some people claim that the agreement with the International Monetary Fund will be revised. Those who previously declared that the countrys problems were insurmountable are now suggesting they will withdraw the relief we have received, which was made possible with the support of women. We have all faced significant challenges to reach this point. Therefore, we must decide whether to maintain this relief or risk losing it. Its essential to consider your own future and that of your children, rather than focusing on names or appearances. This decision is crucial. Throughout this difficult journey, I have not overlooked the needs of the women in our country. We have implemented various programs to provide relief, secure inheritance rights, and grant low-income families the right to their apartments. We have also established programs for upcountry villages and provided meals to school students, all aimed at empowering women. To support this empowerment, we have passed the Womens Empowerment Act. For the past 20 to 30 years, efforts to secure the rights of minorities have been ongoing in this country, and we are now actively working to address these issues. Sinhalese, Tamils, and Muslims should all have equal rights. While we tackle the challenges faced by minority groups, we are also committed to ensuring equal rights for women, who represent the majority in our society. We have introduced the first law to grant rights to all women, regardless of whether they are Sinhalese, Tamil, or Muslim. Additionally, we are implementing laws to ensure women have equal rights with men. It is important to note that we have taken many other steps to advance womens rights in this country. Next year, we plan to hold a large womens conference that will include representatives from major womens organizations as well as those at the village level to raise awareness on these issues. We all desire a better country for ourselves and our children. Before we can achieve this, we must lift the burdens of daily life in our homes and move forward together. I urge everyone to join in our efforts to develop the country.",

        "date": "August 9, 2024 04:42 pm",
        "content": "A third teenager has been arrested in connection with a foiled attack on now-canceled Taylor Swift concerts in Vienna, Austrias interior minister said Friday. Austrian Interior Minister Gerhard Karner said an 18-year-old was taken into custody Thursday evening in Vienna after allegedly being in contact with the main suspect. Karner announced the arrest during an unrelated news conference Friday. Investigators are scrutinizing the networks of the suspects, the Austrian interior ministry told The Associated Press on Friday, adding in a statement that investigators have turned to evaluating physical and electronic evidence. The 19-year-old main suspect and a 17-year-old were arrested Tuesday, while a 15-year-old was also interrogated but was not arrested. None of their names were released, in line with Austrian privacy rules. Officials said Thursday afternoon that no additional suspects were being sought. They did not immediately offer further details Friday. Authorities say the plot appeared to have been inspired by the Islamic State group and al-Qaida. Investigators found bomb-making materials at the main suspects home. Officials say that teenager has confessed to planning to kill as many people as possible outside the concert venue using knives or homemade explosives. Officials say the main suspect and the 18-year-old arrested Friday both pledged oaths of allegiance to the Islamic State group. The 18-year-old comes from the social environment of the main suspect, Karner said. He had been in contact with the main perpetrator, but is not directly connected to the attack plans, the minister said. But, as was found out a few days ago, he took an oath of allegiance specifically to the IS on Aug. 6. Three sold-out concerts were canceled Wednesday because of the plot, devastating Swifties from across the globe. Many of them had dropped thousands of euros (dollars) on travel and lodging in Austrias expensive capital city to attend the Eras Tour shows at the Ernst Happel Stadium. Concert organizers in Austria said they had expected up to 65,000 fans inside the stadium at each concert and as many as 30,000 onlookers outside, where authorities said the suspects planned to strike. The foiled attack was planned for Thursday or Friday, according to Karner. Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer defended the decision to cancel the concerts, saying the arrests took place too close to the shows, scheduled for Thursday, Friday and Saturday. I understand very well that those who wanted to experience the concert live are very sad, Nehammer told a news conference Thursday. Moms and dads are looking after their daughters and sons, who were full of enthusiasm and anticipation for this concert. But its also important that in such serious moments as now, its inevitable that safety comes first. Concert organizer Barracuda Music said in an Instagram post late Wednesday that it had no choice but to cancel the three scheduled shows for everyones safety. Barracuda said all tickets would be refunded. The same message was posted under the Vienna dates on Swifts official website. Swift is also scheduled to perform at Londons Wembley stadium in five concerts between Aug. 15 and 20 to close the European leg of her record-setting Eras Tour. London Mayor Sadiq Khan said that while he understood Viennas reasons for canceling, Were going to carry on. Khan said the capitals authorities were prepared for shows there following lessons learned from a 2017 attack by a suicide bomber at an Ariana Grande concert in Manchester, England, that killed 22 people. Last month, an attacker in England killed three girls and wounded 10 people in a knife attack during a Taylor Swift-themed dance and yoga class. Swift at the time said she was completely in shock over the violence. Swift has not spoken publicly about the plot or canceled shows. Taylor Nation, a verified Instagram page widely believed to be run by her team, reposted the announcement from Barracuda Music in a story, which is only visible for 24 hours. Her main account has not posted anything. Shiraz Maher, an expert on Islamic extremism with the Department of War Studies at Kings College London, said in a statement to the AP that attackers prioritize casualties and therefore choose soft targets where they know large numbers of people will be congregating.

        "date": "August 9, 2024 06:47 pm",
        "content": "The United States, Egypt and Qatar have released a joint statement calling on Israel and Hamas to resume negotiations over a ceasefire and hostage-release deal. The statement said the three nations had forged a framework agreement that had only the details of implementation left to conclude. Israel said it would send negotiators to the proposed talks, which are pencilled in for 15 August in Doha or Cairo. Hamas did not immediately respond. The renewed diplomatic push will be seen as an attempt to stop regional tensions from spiralling out of control, after Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh was assassinated last week. Iran, blaming Israel, has vowed a response - though Israel has not commented directly on the killing. In a joint statement, the three nations invited Israel and Hamas to restart talks on 15 August to close all remaining gaps and commence implementation of the deal without further delay. As mediators, if necessary, we are prepared to present a final bridging proposal that resolves the remaining implementation issues in a manner that meets the expectations of all parties, it said. The statement was signed by US President Joe Biden, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, and the Emir of Qatar Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani. It said the framework agreement was based on principles previously outlined by President Biden on 31 May - which would start with a full ceasefire and the release of a number of hostages - and endorsed by the UN Security Council. US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin said in a statement on Thursday evening he had spoken with Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant to brief him on changes to US forces in the region and reinforce my ironclad support for Israels defense. I also stressed the importance of concluding a ceasefire deal in Gaza that releases the hostages, he said. Despite numerous rounds of talks, the challenge of reaching a ceasefire and hostage release agreement has so far proved elusive. Hamas is pushing for a ceasefire, but Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said the conflict can only stop once Hamas is defeated. On Thursday, Israel continued its bombardment of the Gaza strip. Gazas Hamas-run civil defence force said it hit two schools, killing more than 18 people. The Israeli military said it had struck Hamas command centres. Any proposed talks could be made even more difficult by Hamas decision to elect Yahya Sinwar as its new leader, replacing Haniyeh. Sinwar, who Israel holds responsible for the planning and execution of the 7 October attacks, is seen as one of the groups most extreme figures. Amid fears of an attack from Iran or its allies, Israels security cabinet met in an underground bunker on Thursday, instead of its usual meeting place, Israels Channel 13 reported.

        "date": "August 9, 2024 09:33 pm",
        "content": "A Russian missile struck a supermarket in the Ukrainian town of Kostiantynivka in the front-line Donetsk region on Friday, killing at least 14 people and injuring 43 others, Ukrainian officials said. Heavy black smoke clouds rose from the destroyed building in images and videos posted by officials. The interior minister later said the blaze was put out. Russian terrorists hit an ordinary supermarket and a post office. There are people under the rubble, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on X. Emergency services continued working out the rubble looking for survivors, he added. Kostiantynivka lies just about 13 kilometers from the active combat line in Ukraines east. Ukrainian government-held parts of the Donetsk region regularly come under Russian shelling and air strikes. This week Russia has been fighting what it says is an armored cross-border assault by Ukrainian troops in its Kursk region. The Kyiv military has not commented on that operation yet. No situation on the battlefield can justify targeting civilians, Ukraines Prosecutor General Andriy Kostin said on X, reporting an updated death toll in Kostiantynivka. There was no immediate comment from Moscow. Russia denies intentionally targeting civilians although it has killed thousands of them during the 29 months since it launched its full-scale invasion. Ukrainian regional governor Vadym Filashkin initially said Russia used artillery but later said it carried out the attack with a Kh-38 air-to-surface missile. Nova Poshta, Ukraines largest private postal company, said its cargo office in the supermarket was damaged in the strike. All our employees are alive. One colleague received a concussion  he is getting all the necessary help, the company said on X. Residential houses, shops and more than a dozen cars were as well damaged in the attack, according to the interior ministers post on Telegram. Donetsk region is one of the hottest areas of fighting as Russia targets areas in the direction of the strategic eastern logistics hub of Pokrovsk. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "date": "August 10, 2024 08:42 am",
        "content": "A passenger plane crashed into a gated residential community in Brazils Sao Paulo state Friday, killing all 61 people aboard and leaving a smoldering wreck, officials and the airline said. Officials did not say if anyone was killed on the ground in the neighborhood where the plane landed in the city of Vinhedo, about 80 kilometers (50 miles) northwest of the metropolis of Sao Paulo. But witnesses at the scene said there were no victims among local residents. The airline Voepass said that its plane, an ATR 72 twin-engine turboprop, was headed for Sao Paulos international airport Guarulhos with 57 passengers and 4 crew members aboard when it crashed in Vinhedo. It provided a flight manifest with passenger names, but not their nationalities. A prior statement had said there were 58 passengers. The company regrets to inform that all 61 people on board flight 2283 died at the site, Voepass said in a statement. At this time, Voepass is prioritizing provision of unrestricted assistance to the victims families and effectively collaborating with authorities to determine the causes of the accident. It was the deadliest airline crash since January 2023, when 72 people died on board a Yeti Airlines plane in Nepal that stalled and crashed while making its landing approach. That plane also was an ATR 72, and the final report blamed pilot error. At an event in southern Brazil, President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva asked the crowd to stand and observe a minute of silence as he shared the news. Friday evening, he declared three days of mourning. The states firefighters, military police and civil defense authority dispatched teams to the location. Sao Paulos public security secretary Guilherme Derrite spoke to reporters and confirmed that no survivors had been found. He also said the planes black box was recovered. I thought it was going to fall in our yard, a resident and witness who gave her name only as Ana Lucia de Lima told reporters near the crash site. It was scary, but thank God there were no victims among the locals. It seems that the 62 people inside the plane were the real victims, though. Parana states Gov. Ratinho Júnior told journalists in Vinhedo that many of the passengers were doctors from his state attending a seminar. They were people who were used to saving lives, and now they lost theirs in such tragic circumstances, Júnior said, adding he had friends aboard. It is a sad day. Video obtained from a witness by The Associated Press and verified shows at least two bodies strewn about flaming pieces of wreckage. Brazilian television network GloboNews showed aerial footage of an area with smoke coming out of an obliterated plane fuselage. Additional footage on GloboNews earlier showed the plane plunging in a flat spin. A report from television network Globos meteorological center said it confirmed the possibility of the formation of ice in the region of Vinhedo, and local media cited analysts pointing to icing as a potential cause for the crash. But aviation expert Lito Sousa cautioned that meteorological conditions alone might not be enough to explain why the plane fell as it did. Analyzing an air crash just with images can lead to wrong conclusions about the causes, Sousa told the AP by phone. But we can see a plane with loss of support, no horizontal speed. In this flat spin condition, theres no way to reclaim control of the plane. And Marcelo Moura, director of operations for Voepass, told reporters Friday night that, while there were forecasts for ice, they were within acceptable levels for the aircraft. Likewise, Lt. Col. Carlos Henrique Baldi, of the Brazilian air forces center for the investigation and prevention of air accidents, told reporters in a late afternoon press conference that it was still too early to confirm whether ice caused the accident. The plane is certified in several countries to fly in severe icing conditions, including in countries unlike ours, where the impact of ice is more significant, said Baldi, who heads the centers investigation division. In an earlier statement, the center said that the planes pilots didnt call for help nor say they were operating under adverse weather conditions. In a separate statement, Brazils Federal Police said it already had begun its investigation, and had dispatched specialists in plane crashes and the identification of disaster victims. Authorities began transferring the corpses to the morgue on Friday, and called on victims family members to bring any medical, X-ray and dental exams in order as a means to help identify the bodies. French-Italian plane manufacturer ATR said in a statement that it had been informed that the accident involved its ATR 72-500 model, and said company specialists are fully engaged to support both the investigation and the customer. The ATR 72 generally is used on shorter flights. The planes are built by a joint venture of Airbus in France and Italys Leonardo S.p.A. Crashes involving various models of the ATR 72 have resulted in 470 deaths going back to the 1990s, according to a database of the Aviation Safety Network. The Capela neighborhood where the plane crashed Friday sits in a district far from the center of the prosperous city thats home to 77,000 residents. It had departed from Cascavel, in Parana state.

        "content": "An Israeli airstrike hit a school-turned-shelter in Gaza City early Saturday, killing more than 60 people, Palestinian health authorities said, in one of the deadliest strikes in the 10-month-old war between Israel and Hamas. The Israeli military acknowledged the strike, claiming without evidence that it hit a Hamas command center within the school. The strike on the Tabeen school in central Gaza City also wounded 47 people, the Health Ministrys Ambulance and Emergency service said. The facility, like almost all of Gaza Strips schools, has been used as a shelter for people who have been forced to flee their homes by the war. According to the United Nations, 477 out of 564 schools in Gaza have been directly hit or damaged in the war as of July 6. In June, an Israeli strike on a school sheltering displaced Palestinians in central Gaza killed at least 33 people, including 12 women and children, according to local health officials. The strike came as American, Qatari and Egyptian mediators renewed their push for the two parties to achieve a cease-fire agreement that could help calm soaring tensions in the region following the assassination of top Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran and a senior Hezbollah commander in Beirut. Israels campaign in Gaza has killed more than 39,600 Palestinians and wounded more than 91,700 others, according to the enclaves Health Ministry. The war was triggered by Hamas Oct. 7 attack, in which militants from Gaza stormed into southern Israel, killing around 1,200 people and abducting 250 others. More than 1.9 million of Gazas pre-war population of 2.3 million have been driven from their homes, fleeing repeatedly across the territory to escape offensives. Most are now crowded into ramshackle tent camps in an area of about 50 square kilometers (19 square miles) on the Gaza coast. Source: AP --Agencies",

        "date": "August 10, 2024 01:09 pm",
        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe stated that seven plantation companies have agreed with the governments decision to provide a daily salary of Rs.1, 700 to plantation workers. As the current labour minister, I have planned to convene the Wages Board on Monday to further discuss the matter. If necessary, special laws will be introduced to implement this decision, he added. The President also announced that, workers welfare funds, which have been neglected for many years, will be paid starting next year. President Ranil Wickremesinghe made these remarks while attending the Kandy District Plantation Labour Unions and Youth Leaders meeting organized by the Ceylon Workers Congress today (10) at the KARALIYA Convention Centre And Center For Performing Arts, Kandy. The issues faced by the Tamil community in the hill country were directly presented to the President, and he responded positively to their concerns. The President further elaborated; Over the past two years, the people of this country have faced severe hardships. However, we have managed to bring the economy to a more stable level. While the countrys economic issues are not entirely resolved, we have provided significant relief to the people, easing their burdens compared to 2022. This progress was made possible due to the agreement with the International Monetary Fund. Additionally, we have successfully negotiated with the countries that have lent us money, giving us until 2042 to repay our debts. If we abandon or attempt to amend these agreements, we will lose those benefits, and the country will revert to its previous state, facing issues like shortages and long queues. Therefore, we must decide whether to continue with this program. We cannot be complacent with the success achieved through the International Monetary Fund. We should aim for economic development similar to Indias progress. By 2048, we have planned for rapid development. The people must also decide whether they want leaders who will guide the country forward or those who are more focused on personal pursuits. For many years, workers welfare funds have not been disbursed to the working people. We plan to start paying these funds from next year, as the countrys economy is recovering and the government is now in a position to provide this support. In recent years, the people working in the plantation sector have endured significant hardships. While other workers have received salary increases and farmers have been provided with better income, relief has not yet reached the plantation workers. Seven plantation companies have agreed with the governments decision to set a daily salary of Rs.1,700 for plantation workers. Following the transfer of responsibility from Minister Manusha Nanayakkara, I, as President, am prepared to discuss the matter with the Wages Board next Monday. We will also consider enacting special laws if necessary to implement this decision. I believe that both Minister Jeevan Thondaman and MP P. Digambaran will support the adoption of these laws. Minister of Water Supply and Estate Infrastructure Development, Jeevan Thondaman; It has been a year since I assumed office as a cabinet minister, and I have done my best during this time. Over the past year, Rs.160 million has been allocated solely for estate infrastructure in the Kandy district. It is an unprecedented amount. We also have plans to establish Thondaman Vocational Training Centers in Kandy and Badulla, with support from the Indian government. While the hill country has a population of about one million, only 115,000 are employed in the plantation sector. Plantation workers are seeking a pay rise, and President Ranil Wickremesinghe has implemented various programs to address the development of the hill country and the salary issue. The government is actively taking steps to increase the wages of plantation workers, and several estate companies have already agreed to wage hikes. A meeting will be held this coming Monday with the estate companies, under the patronage of President Ranil Wickremesinghe, to further address this matter. State Minister for Plantation Industries and Mahaweli Development, Lohan Ratwatte; Today, our country has a leader who genuinely prioritizes solving the land and salary issues faced by the estate community. Under his guidance and leadership, we have already begun addressing these problems swiftly. Its important to note that these actions were not motivated by any election goals. Therefore, I urge all of us to unite in reappointing President Ranil Wickremesinghe as the President of our countrysomeone who truly understands and addresses the needs of the people, regardless of race, religion, or political affiliateion. I ask you all to think of the country first and cast your valuable votes for him. State Minister of Justice and Prison Affairs, Anuradha Jayaratne; President Ranil Wickremesinghe has the support of 6 out of the 7 MPs elected by the Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) in the Kandy district. Additionally, Minister Jeevan Thondaman stands with us, carrying forward the strength and legacy provided by his grandfather and father. We are all committed to helping President Ranil Wickremesinghe secure a great victory in the Kandy district and lead the country by September 22nd. All our endeavours for the people of the plantation sector have been possible due to the unwavering support and patronage from the President. He is determined to secure your land rights and is challenging estate companies to ensure a fair salary increase. Its important to note that none of these efforts were initiated with election motives. From the very beginning, the President has made decisions with the sincere intent of benefiting the estate community. Parliamentarian M. Rameshwaran; In 2022, when the country was in crisis, no leader stepped forward to take charge. Today, the leaders running for the presidential election should be asked why they didnt step up when the people were suffering. President Ranil Wickremesinghe took on the responsibility in 2022 and created an environment where the oppressed could live with dignity. He made many decisions aimed at improving the lives of the estate community, including a program to provide them with land rights. The President has allocated the necessary funds for the development of the hill country, including provisions for granting 10 perches of land and for the educational advancement of students in the area. Therefore, people should recognize who saved the country during its most significant economic crisis. Former Minister Manusha Nanayakkara; In the past two years, President Ranil Wickremesinghe has initiated significant programs to benefit estate workers, focusing on improving their land rights and daily allowances. Unlike other leaders who wait for election periods, the President has consistently advocated for estate communities since taking office, and he has supported an increase in their daily wages. During the economic crisis, plantation workers played a crucial role by continuing to harvest tea and bolster export income, a contribution the President acknowledges. A committee was appointed to address land issues, and following the wage increase in 2020, no further wage adjustments had been made. The Wages Board was convened to discuss the daily allowance, resulting in a proposal for a daily allowance of Rs.1, 700. A fourteen-day period was provided for raising objections to this proposal. It was officially announced in Kotagala on May 1. Subsequently, the estate company filed a lawsuit and obtained an injunction. However, we are exploring alternative methods to increase the daily allowance for plantation workers. Due to the withdrawal of the Ministry of Labours gazette notification, the estate owners have dropped their case. The salary council will reconvene next Monday, with a new proposal to set the daily allowance at Rs.1, 350 and a production allowance at Rs.350. Some individuals are attempting to leverage this situation for political gain. As a leader representing plantation workers, MP P. Thigambaram has never submitted a proposal to increase their salaries. When the Ceylon Workers Congress proposed wage increases, they only inquired whether the wages would be raised or not. Thigambaram has been slow to provide allowances to estate workers. In the past two years, the country has received USD 12 billion from foreign workers alone. The group led by Sajith Premadasa, unable to wait, went to court to challenge Manusha Nanayakkaras position. With people returning to normal life and the era of long queues coming to an end, Sajith Premadasa is now attempting to disrupt MPs who support the President by canceling their party memberships. We remain steadfast, and all of this will culminate in a victory for President Ranil Wickremesinghe.",

Influencers who had been paid to participate joined fans to try the noodles served by chefs onboard the boat as it sailed through the Danish capital. The regulators warning in June was specifically aimed at children and youngsters, who challenge each other on social media to eat the spicy ramen, as well as vulnerable adults, it said in a statement at the time.

        "date": "August 11, 2024 10:32 am",
        "content": "A drone attack on Rohingya fleeing Myanmar killed many dozens of people, including families with children, several witnesses said, describing survivors wandering between piles of bodies to identify dead and injured relatives. Four witnesses, activists and a diplomat described drone attacks on Monday that struck down families waiting to cross the border into neighbouring Bangladesh. A heavily pregnant woman and her 2-year-old daughter were among the victims in the attack, the single deadliest known assault on civilians in Rakhine state during recent weeks of fighting between junta troops and rebels. Three of the witnesses told Reuters on Friday that the Arakan Army was responsible, allegations the group denied. The militia and Myanmars military blamed each another. Reuters could not verify how many people had died in the attack or independently determine responsibility. Videos posted to social media showed piles of bodies strewn across muddy ground, their suitcases and backpacks scattered around them. Three survivors said more than 200 had died while a witness to the aftermath said he had seen at least 70 bodies. Reuters verified the location of the videos as just outside the coastal Myanmar town of Maungdaw. Reuters was not able to independently confirm the date the videos were filmed. One witness, 35-year-old Mohammed Eleyas, said his pregnant wife and 2-year-old daughter were wounded in the attack and later died. He was standing with them on the shoreline when drones began attacking the crowds, Eleyas told Reuters from a refugee camp in Bangladesh. I heard the deafening sound of shelling multiple times, he said. Eleyas said he lay on the ground to protect himself and when he got up, he saw his wife and daughter critically injured and many of his other relatives dead. A second witness, Shamsuddin, 28, said he survived with his wife and newborn son. Also speaking from a refugee camp in Bangladesh, he said that after the attack many lay dead and some people were shouting out from the pain of their injuries. Boats carrying fleeing Rohingya, members of a mostly Muslim minority who face extreme persecution in Myanmar, also sank in the Naf River that separates the two countries on Monday, killing dozens more, according to two witnesses and Bangladesh media. Medecins Sans Frontieres said in a statement the aid organisation had treated 39 people who had crossed from Myanmar into Bangladesh since Saturday for violence-related injuries, including mortar shell injuries and gunshot wounds. Patients described seeing people bombed while trying to find boats to cross the river, the statement said. A spokesperson for the United Nations High Commission for Refugees said the agency was aware of the deaths of refugees from the capsize of two boats in the Bay of Bengal and it had heard reports of civilian deaths in Maungdaw but that it could not confirm the numbers or circumstances. FIGHTING IN THE REGION The Rohingya have been long persecuted in Buddhist-majority Myanmar. More than 730,000 of them fled the country in 2017 after a military-led crackdown that the U.N. said was carried out with genocidal intent. Myanmar has been in turmoil since the military seized power from a democratically elected government in 2021, and mass protests evolved into widespread armed struggle. Rohingya have been leaving Rakhine for weeks as the Arakan Army, one of many armed groups fighting, has made sweeping gains in the north, home to a large population of Muslims. Reuters has previously reported that the militia burned down the largest Rohingya town in May, leaving Maungdaw, which is under siege by the rebels, as the last major Rohingya settlement aside from grim displacement camps further south. The group denied the allegations. Activist groups condemned this weeks attacks. A senior Western diplomat said he had confirmed the reports. These reports of hundreds of Rohingya killed at the BangladeshMyanmar border are, Im sorry to say, accurate, Bob Rae, Canadas ambassador to the United Nations and a previous special envoy to Myanmar, posted on X on Wednesday. Myanmars junta blamed the Arakan Army in a post on its Telegram channel. The militia denied responsibility. According to our investigation, family members of terrorists tried to go to Bangladesh from Maungdaw and the junta dropped the bomb because they left without permission, Arakan Army spokesman Khine Thu Kha told Reuters, referring to Muslims who have joined Rohingya armed groups fighting against the Arakan Army. TRYING TO GET TO SAFETY Reuters was able to confirm the location of the videos seen on social media from the position and shape of the mountain and shoreline, which matched file and satellite imagery of the area. The fencing featured in one of the videos also matched file imagery of the location. The location of the videos matched the area described by Shamsuddin. Eleyas described how his wife and daughter died in the aftermath of the attack, and his desperate efforts to find a boat that would take them to Bangladesh. Before his wife died, We apologised to each other for any wrongs we may have done in our lives, he said. Around midnight, he said, he finally found a small boat and managed to cross the border with it. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "content": "The National Investigation Agency (NIA) on Saturday arrested a key suspect in the Sri Lankan human trafficking case from Tamil Nadu. The accused, Seeni Aabulkhan, had been on the run for the past three years. The investigation revealed that Aabulkhan, along with his associates, was involved in confining trafficked victims on a boat before sending them to Mangaluru for further confinement. The case began in June 2021 when the Mangaluru Police rescued 13 Sri Lankan nationals from traffickers. The NIA took over the investigation and re-registered the case. The probe uncovered that a Sri Lankan national named Eesan, believed to be the kingpin of the racket with links to the terror outfit LTTE, collaborated with Aabulkhan to illegally transport 38 Sri Lankan nationals to various parts of Tamil Nadu. The victims were falsely promised employment opportunities in Canada besides assurances to obtain legitimate documents for migration to the country. The NIA has filed chargesheets against 10 accused between October 2021 and January 2024. The investigation is ongoing as the agency continues its efforts to apprehend the remaining three suspects, who are still at large. A similar incident occurred in July as the NIA arrested four key accused in Delhi suspected of being involved in luring and trafficking young Indians to foreign countries on the pretext of offering them lucrative jobs.

        "title": "Mia le Roux makes history as first hearing-impaired Miss South Africa",
        "date": "August 11, 2024 05:03 pm",
        "content": "Mia le Roux made history by becoming the first deaf woman to be crowned Miss South Africa, following a contentious competition marked by controversy. The pageant was marred by the withdrawal of a finalist who faced online harassment and bullying over her Nigerian roots, highlighting deeper issues of inclusivity and acceptance. Nigerian-born Chidimma Vanessa Adetshina announced her withdrawal from the competition on Thursday, citing safety and the well-being of herself and that of her family members. Born in Soweto, South Africa to a Nigerian father and a mother who is of Mozambican descent, Chidimmas participation in the competition and her rise to become a finalist in the competition was a subject of controversy as many South Africans objected to her participation in the competition, citing that she is not truly a South African. Social media attacks targeted her Nigerian heritage despite her being born in South Africa and meeting all competition requirements. Chidimmas withdrawal from the competition came in a statement she personally signed and posted on her Instagram page amid the continued controversies surrounding her nationality ignited by the South African authorities, despite organisers certification of her qualification. In the statement seen by SaharaReporters, Chidimma said, I would like to start off by thanking everyone who has stood beside me right from the start of my Miss South Africa journey. Im really grateful for all the love and support I have been shown. Being part of the Miss South Africa 2024 competition has been an amazing journey; however, after much careful consideration, I have made the difficult decision to withdraw myself from the competition for the safety and wellbeing of my family and I. With the support of the Miss South Africa Organisation, I leave with a heart full of gratitude for this amazing experience. In her acceptance speech, Ms. Le Roux expressed her desire to inspire those who feel marginalised or excluded from society. She emphasised her commitment to supporting individuals who face financial barriers or have disabilities, aiming to uplift and amplify their voices. At just one year old, Ms. Le Roux was diagnosed with profound hearing loss, and later received a cochlear implant to assist with sound perception. Through determination and hard work, she overcame significant communication barriers, requiring two years of speech therapy to utter her first words. Now, as a triumphant 28-year-old model and marketing manager, she proudly asserts her identity, saying she is proudly a South African deaf woman who knows what it feels like to be excluded.
