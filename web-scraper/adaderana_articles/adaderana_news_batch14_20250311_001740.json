        "date": "April 4, 2023 11:33 am",
        "content": "One person died and some 30 passengers were injured, many of them seriously, when a train partially derailed near The Hague in the early hours of Tuesday, sending at least one carriage into a field next to the tracks, Dutch emergency services said. Television images showed one of the people using makeshift bridges to cross a canal running alongside the rails to reach the stricken train in the darkness. Many windows in the train carriages were broken. It was not clear if that happened during the accident or as passengers attempted to escape. Injured passengers were treated in homes near the rails and transported in a fleet of ambulances to hospitals, including a calamity hospital opened in the central city of Utrecht. The cause of the accident that happened around 3:25 a.m. (0125 GMT) in the town of Voorschoten, near The Hague, was not immediately clear. Dutch media reported that there was a small construction crane on the tracks, but authorities did not immediately confirm that. This is an incredibly tragic accident. I sympathize with the victims. Unfortunately, there is also a fatality to mourn. My thoughts go out to all the family and friends of those involved, Voorschoten Mayor Nadine Stemerdink said in a statement. Ingrid de Roos, a spokeswoman for local fire services, told news show WNL that a small fire broke out at the rear of the train but was quickly extinguished. John Voppen, CEO of the rail network company Pro Rail, called the accident a black day for Dutch railways and said the cause was under investigation. Source - The Associated Press -Agencies",

        "date": "April 4, 2023 03:49 pm",
        "content": "The Catholic Bishops Conference in Sri Lanka has urged the government to uphold the Constitution and the democracy of the country and not to proceed with any unwarranted measures to interfere with the independence of the judiciary and preserve the freedom of speech and expression of all its citizens. Issuing a statement on the independence of the judiciary and the freedom of speech, the Catholic Bishops Conference calls upon the Government to restrain and defend any attempts made by certain individuals under the cover of privileges to curtail media institutions that are critical towards the activities of the Government as a consequence which directly threatens to infringe the freedom of speech and expression including publication enshrined in the Constitution. The association also mentions that it has been reported in the media that an Interim Order had been given by the Judges of the Supreme Court regarding a Fundamental Rights case on March 03, directing the Secretary of the Finance Ministry and the Attorney General to not withhold the funds already allocated for the holding of the Local Government Elections, under the 2023 Budget. Subsequently, it had been reported that a Member of Parliament had requested the Speaker of the Parliament to refer the conduct of the Judges of the Supreme Court that delivered the aforesaid Interim order as a breach of Parliamentary Privileges, that the Speaker had accepted the said request, and made a referral to the Parliamentary Committee on Ethics and Privileges. It had also been reported that a State Minister had thereafter requested the Deputy Speaker of the Parliament to advise the relevant authorities to not proceed and take any action based upon the aforesaid Interim Order made by the Supreme Court with regard to the Local Government election, until the Parliamentary Committee on Privileges concludes its inquiry, it added. Thus, the Catholic Bishops Conference expresses that such conduct demonstrated by persons holding positions of responsibility within the organ of the Government amounts to interfering with the entire Judicial process and undermines the very independence of the organ of the Judiciary of the Nation, highlighting that such conduct demonstrated shall directly violate the independence of Their Lordships to perform their powers and functions without any interference and shall also threaten to disrupt the very Doctrine of Separation of Powers of the country. The Catholic Bishops Conference, which stresses that it is the duty of all Governmental and other institutions to respect and observe the Independence of the Judiciary, also emphasizes that such interference demonstrated by these individuals of the Government has already been widely criticized locally and internationally as being a serious and unwarranted encroachment on the Independence of the Judiciary and the judicial function in Sri Lanka, which is wholly unnecessary at this very crucial juncture of the Nation.",

        "title": "NASA names four astronauts for first crewed moon mission in 50 years",
        "date": "April 4, 2023 03:54 pm",
        "content": "Astronauts who will helm the first crewed moon mission in five decades were revealed on Monday, queuing up the quartet to begin training for the historic Artemis II lunar flyby that is set to take off in November 2024. The astronauts are NASAs Reid Wiseman, Victor Glover and Christina Koch, and Jeremy Hansen of the Canadian Space Agency. Wiseman is a 47-year-old decorated naval aviator and test pilot who was first selected to be a NASA astronaut in 2009. A native of Baltimore, Maryland, hes completed one prior spaceflight, a 165-day trip to the International Space Station that had launched aboard a Russian Soyuz rocket in 2014. Most recently, Wiseman served as chief of the astronaut office before stepping down in November 2022, making him eligible for a flight assignment. Wiseman will serve as commander of the Artemis II mission. Hansen, 47, is a fighter pilot who was selected by the Canadian Space Agency for astronaut training in 2009. From London, Ontario, Hansen is one of only four active Canadian astronauts, and he recently became the first Canadian to be put in charge of training for a new class of NASA astronauts. He will be the first Canadian ever to travel to deep space. Glover is a 46-year-old naval aviator who returned to Earth from his first spaceflight in 2021 after piloting the second crewed flight of SpaceXs Crew Dragon spacecraft and spending nearly six months aboard the International Space Station. Its so much more than the four names that have been announced, Glover said during the Monday announcement at NASA Johnson Space Center in Houston. We need to celebrate this moment in human history.  It is the next step in the journey that will get humanity to Mars. Glover, born in Pomona, California, served in several military squadrons in the United States and Japan in the 2000s, and he completed test pilot training with the US Air Force. When he was selected for the NASA astronaut corps in 2013, he was working in the US Senate as a legislative fellow. All told, Glover logged 3,000 flight hours in more than 40 aircraft, over 400 carrier arrested landings and 24 combat missions. Glovers first mission to space was as part of the SpaceX Crew-1 team, which launched to the International Space Station in November 2020 for a six-month stay on the orbiting laboratory. Koch, 44, is a veteran of six spacewalks  including the first all-female spacewalk in 2019. She holds the record for the longest single spaceflight by a woman, with a total of 328 days in space. Koch is also an an electrical engineer who helped develop scientific instruments for multiple NASA mission. Koch, a native of Grand Rapids, Michigan, also spent a year at the South Pole, an arduous stay that could well prepare her for the intensity of a moon mission. About this mission The Artemis II mission will build on Artemis I, an uncrewed test mission that sent NASAs Orion capsule on a 1.4 million-mile voyage to lap the moon that concluded in December. The space agency deemed that mission a success and is still working to review all the data collected. If all goes to plan, Artemis II will take off around November 2024. The crew members, strapped inside the Orion spacecraft, will launch atop a NASA-developed Space Launch System rocket from NASAs Kennedy Space Center in Florida. The journey is expected to last about 10 days and will send the crew out beyond the moon, potentially further than any human has traveled in history, though the exact distance is yet to be determined. The exact distance beyond the Moon will depend on the day of liftoff and the relative distance of the Moon from the Earth at the time of the mission, NASA spokesperson Kathryn Hambleton said via email. After circling the moon, the spacecraft will return to Earth for a splashdown landing in the Pacific Ocean. Artemis II is expected to pave the way for the Artemis III mission later this decade, which NASA has vowed will put the first woman and person of color on the lunar surface. It will also mark the first time humans have touched down on the moon since the Apollo program ended in 1972. The Artemis III mission is expected to take off later this decade. But much of the technology the mission will require, including spacesuits for walking on the moon and a lunar lander to ferry the astronauts to the moons surface, is still in development. NASA is targeting a 2025 launch date for Artemis III, though the space agencys inspector general has already said delays will likely push the mission to 2026 or later. The space agency has been seeking to return people to the moon for more than a decade. The Artemis program was designed to pave the way to establishing a permanent lunar outpost, allowing astronauts to live and work deeper into space long term as NASA and its partners map a path to sending the first humans to Mars. Picking the astronauts Vanessa Wyche, the director of NASAs Johnson Space Center, declined to provide details to CNN about the selection process. But she emphasized the diversity of the Artemis II crew, which includes men and women rather than only a staff of White male test pilots as has been the case for historic missions of the past. I can tell you, they still all have the right stuff, Wyche said. We have requirements different than we did (when we) just had test pilots on inaugural missions. Koch said in an interview with CNNs Ed Lavandera that the group found out they were selected a few weeks ago. We were all sent to a meeting that was on our calendars under a different pretext that didnt sound as lofty as the one it was going to be, Koch said. And accidentally two of us were very late to that meeting. She said the offer rendered her speechless. It truly is an honor, she added. Its an honor  not to get myself in the space  but because its amazing to be a part of this team thats going back to the moon and on to Mars. An interview with the four astronauts will air on CNN This Morning on Tuesday, which starts at 6 am ET. Source: CNN -Agencies",

        "date": "April 4, 2023 04:11 pm",
        "content": "Health experts have warned of the risk of dehydration and urge the general public to increase their water intake and to wear lightweight clothes in order to stay hydrated. Joining Ada Deranas Big Focus program this morning (April 04), paediatric specialist of the Lady Ridgeway Childrens Hospital in Colombo Dr. Deepal Perera stated that the culture of wearing plain clothes in the summer that prevails in foreign countries should be introduced in Sri Lanka too. Accordingly, the doctor emphasized that people should minimize sun exposure as much as possible when they are outside. In countries like England, they do lightweight clothes during the summer. We also inform our children to such clothes. Those who wear a tie can clad themselves in a simple outfit and leave out the tie. We are asking them to attend schools in lightweight attire. Now we can also introduce these attires to Sri Lanka as well. It is not good to wear several layers of clothes these days as it increases sweating. You can wear a simple dress and a hat to minimize sunlight absorption. Dr. Perera also mentioned that it is essential to drink not only water but also follow a natural liquid diet to prevent dehydration. Childrens water intake should be in proportion to their weight. In general, it is advised to give an extra bottle of water to children when they leave for school. Even for an adult, instead of water, it is better to drink some more lime or Jeevani. It can reduce complications. Meanwhile, the Director of the Lady Ridgeway Childrens Hospital in Colombo Dr. G. Wijesooriya clarified that there is no truth to the belief that obesity is reduced by higher water intake. You wont lose weight just by drinking water... But if you drink some water before your main meals, the amount of food you take in will reduce and then you can lose weight... In the meantime, the Department of Meteorology said yesterday (April 03) that the warm weather is expected to continue until the end of May.",

        "date": "April 4, 2023 05:07 pm",
        "content": "The chairman of the Public Utilities Commission (PUCSL) has urged the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) to propose a tariff reduction taking into account the recent developments in the country that drive down the electricity utility. In a press release, PUCSL chief Janaka Ratnayake listed several reasons as to why the CEB should slash the tariffs. He stated that, as per actual data for the first quarter of the year, the electricity demand in the country has dropped by 18 in comparison to 2022, explaining that this reduces the reliance on high-cost oil-fired thermal electricity generation. Apart from the demand, the USD exchange rate too has gone down from LKR 370 per USD to around LKR 325 per USD, which is a 13 reduction, Ratnayake noted, thus noting that this brings down fuel and other import costs of the CEB. This alone would reduce costs by about 20 per annum. In addition to the aforementioned two cost divers, the international fuel prices too have reduced significantly, and as a result, the fuel costs to CEB would reduce significantly. At present, the Richards Bay Coal index is at 133 USDMT, Singapore PLATTS for Furnace Oil is 403 USDMT, Singapore PLATTS for Diesel is 98.38 USDbbl and Singapore PLATTS for high-quality chemical Naptha is 674 USD MT. In a recent letter to the CEB, Ratnayake requested the CEB to propose a reduced electricity tariff structure capturing all these recent developments by 15 May. This is expected to provide much-needed relief to all the consumers, especially the vulnerable Domestic category consumers and the SME sector of the economy, he said further.",

Having considered the recent and expected economic developments, and macroeconomic projections on domestic and global fronts, the Monetary Board decided that the maintenance of the prevailing tight monetary policy stance is necessary. This will ensure that monetary conditions remain sufficiently tight to facilitate the continuation of the ongoing disinflation process amidst the improvements in market sentiments following the finalisation of the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the downward shift in elevated market interest rates reflecting the falling risk premia, the Central Bank said in a press release.

        "title": "Timely, credible structural reforms vital for Sri Lanka to reset its course: World Bank",
        "date": "April 4, 2023 10:59 pm",
        "content": "Sri Lankas heightened fiscal, external, and financial sector imbalances and its fluid political situation pose significant uncertainty for the countrys economic outlook, says the World Bank in its twice-a-year update, underscoring the need to address the root causes of the countrys economic crisis and build a strong and resilient economy to prevent future crises. Released today (April 04), the Sri Lanka Development Update (SLDU), Time to Reset projects the countrys economy to contract by 4.3 percent in 2023, as demand continues to be subdued, job and income losses intensify, and supply-side constraints adversely affect production. The economic crisis in Sri Lanka has had deep impacts with over half a million jobs lost and 2.7 million additional people falling into poverty between 2021 and 2022, said Faris H. Hadad-Zervos, the World Bank Country Director for Maldives, Nepal, and Sri Lanka. The prolonged recovery from the scarring effects of this crisis in addition to a slow debt restructuring process, limited external financing support and an uncertain global environment pose significant risks to the countrys economic growth. The economy will continue to face significant challenges in 2023 and beyond. A lower-level external trade equilibrium could have contagion effects on domestic trade, economic activity, jobs and incomes. Combined with adverse effects from revenue-mobilization efforts, which are essential for regaining fiscal sustainability, poverty projections could worsen. The financial sector needs to be managed carefully, given rising non-performing loans and large public sector exposures. Mitigating the impacts on the poor and vulnerable remains critical during the adjustment. Reducing poverty requires better-targeted social assistance, an expansion of employment in industry and services, and a recovery in the real value of incomes. However, strong and effective implementation of the governments reform program, supported by financing from international partners, could boost confidence and attract fresh capital inflows that are key to improving job prospects and restoring livelihoods. The current crisis is not a temporary liquidity shock that can be resolved by external financing support from outside. Instead, the crisis provides a unique opportunity to implement deep and permanent structural reforms that may be difficult in normal circumstances, added Hadad-Zervos. Sri Lanka can use this opportunity to build a strong and resilient economy. The SLDU is a companion piece to the latest South Asia Economic Focus, Expanding Opportunities: Toward Inclusive Growth, which projects regional growth to average 5.6 percent in 2023, a slight downward revision from the October 2022 forecast. Growth is expected to remain moderate at 5.9 percent in 2024, following an initial post-pandemic recovery of 8.2 percent in 2021. The report notes that to go from recovery to sustained growth, South Asia needs to ensure economic development is inclusive. The region has among the worlds highest inequality of opportunity. Between 40 and 60 percent of total inequality in South Asia is driven by circumstances out of an individuals control such as place of birth, family background, caste, ethnicity, and gender. Intergenerational mobility is also among the worlds lowest. Data highlighted in the report shows that less than 9 percent of individuals whose parents have low levels of education reach education levels of the upper 25 percent. Such disparities lead to differences in access to jobs, earnings, consumption, and welfare and to calls for redistributive policies. The report recommends continuing to improve the quality of primary education and expanding access to secondary and higher education, evaluate and strengthen affirmative action policies targeted to low opportunity groups, and policies to improve the business climate for small and medium enterprises, who account for the bulk of job opportunities for the less well-off. In addition, reducing barriers to labor mobility can have a powerful equalizing impact as urban areas tend to offer more opportunities for social mobility. -World Bank",

        "date": "April 5, 2023 04:24 am",
        "content": "Donald Trump has been charged with 34 felony counts of falsifying business records, making him the first former US president to face a criminal trial. Appearing in a Manhattan court, Mr Trump pleaded not guilty after his formal arrest earlier on Tuesday. As predicted, most of the charges stem from an alleged hush-money payment to a porn star in the days before the 2016 presidential election. Mr Trump, 76, has denied any wrongdoing in the case. A stony-faced Mr Trump said nothing as he left the courtroom after his arraignment. He is expected to return immediately to his Florida home Mar-a-Lago on Tuesday evening, where he plans to deliver remarks at 20:15 local time (01:15 BST). The case hinges on hush money payments made to two women before the 2016 presidential election to keep them from speaking about sexual encounters they say they had with Mr Trump. They are not named in the legal documents, but Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg said Mr Trump had arranged for 130,000 (105,000) to be paid to porn star Stormy Daniels to buy her silence. Mr Trumps former lawyer, Michael Cohen, says he made the payment at Mr Trumps direction to keep Ms Daniels quiet about her affair with the then-candidate. The second payment, for 150,000 (120,000), was reportedly made to Karen McDougal, a former Playboy magazine Playmate of the Year. It was made by US tabloid the National Enquirer, as part of an alleged catch and kill scheme, where an outlet buys the rights to a story but withholds publication - preventing publication by other outlets. According to prosecutors, the National Enquirer admitted to paying a source of a story to ensure that person did not publicise damaging allegations about Mr Trump before the 2016 election. Hush money agreements are not illegal, but Manhattan district attorney Alvin Bragg has been investigating whether business records were falsified in relation to the payment. The odds of a conviction are so far unclear but the charges against Mr Trump - who has already launched his third bid for the White House - have pulled the country into unchartered political territory. While a criminal conviction would not prevent Mr Trump from either running for president or from re-claiming the Oval Office, the prolonged legal fight may be a major distraction for the Republican front-runner, and will add a new layer of turmoil to his partys primary. Seems so SURREAL - WOW, they are going to ARREST ME, Mr Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform on the way to court. Cant believe this is happening in America. Hundreds of Mr Trumps supporters congregated at a park across from the courthouse on Tuesday morning, galvanised by the charges filed against him. They were joined by Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, a right-wing Republican from Georgia who derided the Democratic party as communists and failures. Every single American should be concerned, Ms Greene said of Mr Trumps indictment. Ms Greene, 48, has repeatedly promoted the false claim that Mr Trump won the 2020 presidential election. Her appearance was met by outrage from counter-protesters who shouted and jeered, at times drowning her speech out entirely. Go back to Georgia! one woman shouted. The former president is the focus of three other investigations, related to efforts to overturn the 2020 election results and over his handling of classified documents after leaving the White House.

        "date": "April 5, 2023 02:12 pm",
        "content": "Donald Trump has said the US is going to hell in a defiant address after pleading not guilty to falsifying business records to hide damaging information ahead of the 2016 election. The former president was charged with 34 felony counts in a Manhattan court on Tuesday. These relate to a hush money payment to porn star Stormy Daniels, who says they had an adulterous affair. Mr Trump is the first US president in history to face a criminal trial. The only crime that I have committed is to fearlessly defend our nation from those who seek to destroy it, the 76-year-old told supporters gathered at his Mar-a-Lago home in Florida after he appeared in court. He said that the fake case was simply part of a Democratic conspiracy to interfere with next years presidential election, in which he is running. Mr Trump also falsely claimed that every single pundit and legal analyst had said there was no case against him. Earlier, he sat stony-faced and silent for the nearly hour-long proceedings before Judge Juan Merchan, speaking out loud only in response to the judges questions and to enter his plea of not guilty. Mr Trump said nothing to reporters as he left court. The case against the former president hinges on a hush-money payment of 130,000 (104,000) made before the 2016 presidential election. While such a payment is not illegal, the prosecution says Mr Trump falsified business records and broke election laws as he tried to cover up the payments. His former lawyer, Michael Cohen - who turned against his former boss - has said he made the payment at Mr Trumps direction. Each of the charges carries a maximum of four years in prison, although a judge could sentence Mr Trump to probation if he is convicted. The odds of his being found guilty are so far unclear, but the charges have pulled the country into uncharted political territory. Mr Trumps trial could begin as early as January 2024, Judge Merchan said, meaning the Republican could be back in court just as primaries begin to select the partys nominee. Prosecutors also pointed to other payments they say were made via an intermediary on behalf of Mr Trump to suppress potentially politically damaging stories. They allege 30,000 was paid to buy the silence of a doorman at Trump Tower who claimed Mr Trump had a lovechild. And 150,000 was paid to Karen McDougal, a former Playboy model who said she had a sexual relationship with Mr Trump. Prosecutors said both payments were made by the National Enquirer, a US tabloid whose publisher is a long-time ally of Mr Trump. While a criminal conviction would not prevent Mr Trump from either running for president or from reclaiming the Oval Office, the prolonged legal fight could prove a major distraction for the Republican front-runner and may add a new layer of turmoil to his partys primary.

        "date": "April 5, 2023 03:42 pm",
        "content": "Sri Lankas economy is projected to contract further in 2023 before it begins a gradual recovery in 2024, as the country navigates an unprecedented economic crisis, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) said in its annual flagship economic publication, the Asian Development Outlook (ADO) April 2023. The economy contracted by 7.8 in 2022 and is forecast to contract by 3 in 2023 as it continues to grapple with the challenge of debt restructuring and balance of payments difficulties, according to the report. The ADB says reform measures, such as the reversal of the tax cuts of 2019, and the recent approval of the International Monetary Funds (IMF) Extended Fund Facility arrangement will support the countrys efforts to stabilize its economy. Sri Lankas recovery from the crisis hinges on timely progress on debt relief and steadfast implementation of reforms, the ADB said further. Sri Lanka entered the crisis on a weak footing as pre-pandemic macroeconomic vulnerabilities, policy missteps, and shocks left the country with thin buffers on the eve of the pandemic. In 2022, foreign currency scarcity led to shortages of essentials and triggered an acute energy crisis with prolonged power cuts and transport bottlenecks due to lack of fuel, which Sri Lanka needs to import. Inflation soared and eroded living standards, pushing many into poverty. The economic crisis has impacted the poor and vulnerable disproportionally. Sri Lanka has a long road to recovery, and it will be critical to ensure the poor and vulnerable are protected, said Deputy Country Director for Sri Lanka Utsav Kumar. It is imperative that the country address the root causes of internal and external imbalances, for which an unwavering commitment to reforms is essential. The ADB stressed that the needed reforms include enhancing domestic resource mobilization, improving the performance of state-owned enterprises to reduce their fiscal burden, strengthening public financial management, and encouraging private sector activities through harmonizing trade and investment policies. The ADB deemed improving governance and accountability mechanisms, such as strengthening anticorruption legislation, building strong institutions, and increasing transparency, essential to address Sri Lankas economic vulnerability.",

This panel is tasked with reporting to the BASLs management committee after studying the Anti-Terrorism Bill published in the Government Gazette on 22 March. This Bill seeks to abolish the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA) and introduce an Anti-Terrorism Act. Deeply concerned about the Bill, the Bar Association said it is firmly of the view that no legislation should be introduced to curtail andor suppress, directly or indirectly the fundamental rights of citizens, enshrined in the countrys Constitution. The BASL cautioned that the Bill, if passed into law, will have far-reaching effects. The association went on to note that the Bill was published in the Gazette without adequate consultations with the relevant stakeholders including the BASL, thus calling on the Government to consider deferring the Bill until there is a wider stakeholder consultation and the concerns of stakeholders including the BASL are taken into account. The BASL stressed that it would not hesitate to challenge any Bill that would deem to undermine the Rule of Law and the Liberty of the citizens in the country.",

Joining an event held at the Ministry of Finance to mark the Statements of Corporate Intent, the state minister emphasized that 39 out of the 52 strategically important public institutions are making profits while 13 of them are still making losses. Further, the losses incurred by the 13 loss-making public institutions currently amount to Rs. 1029 billion, while the profits made by the other 39 profit-making public institutions are at Rs. 218 billion, State Minister Semasinghe mentioned. He also highlighted that the annual loss made by the public institutions is more than Rs. 811 billion, adding that only Rs. 28 billion have been paid by the profit-making public institutions as taxes to the treasury. Meanwhile, the State Minister expressed that while the government has the advantage of market monopoly in many related businesses, these institutions are making losses. Furthermore, he also pointed out that all parties should understand the fund allocations from the Treasury are money collected from the people of the country for the maintenance of these institutions. The state minister further said that, therefore, the government would not continue to run the institutions to add to the burden on the people but will continue to be the regulatory body. Moreover, the state minister stated that as a result of the economic crisis, Sri Lanka has to follow the globally accepted economic methods, pointing out that Sri Lanka would never have adopted such economic measures if there was no such experience a worst economic crisis. He also mentioned that the methods to be adopted by a country to stabilize the economy of a country, should be identified by itself.",

Somalia hasnt printed new banknotes since descending into a civil war after the government collapsed in 1991. Most of the bills that were in circulation disappeared or became too worn out to use. They were replaced by US dollars or counterfeit notes, often printed or shipped in by warlords and businessmen in breakaway regions. In 2017, the International Monetary Fund estimated that 98 of the local currency circulating in the economy was fake. The Somalia economy is dollarized for the last 30 plus years, Abdirahman Mohamed Abdullahi, the central banks governor, said in an interview in Mogadishu, the capital. Until such a time we reintroduce the Somali shilling. it would not be easy to have a monetary policy in the country, While he wouldnt commit to a timeframe for the reissuance of the currency, his deputy Ali Yasin Wardheere in January said the bank is targeting next year. The re-introduction of the shilling, which will circulate alongside the dollar, is essential to facilitate the development of a monetary policy that is vital for the growth of the economy, Abdullahi said. The central bank began working on plans to issue high-value currency notes in 2017 with the help of the IMF, and the World Bank subsequently became involved. Abdullahi expects the economy, which has faced multiple shocks in the past two years from Covid-19, a severe drought and Russias war in Ukraine, to expand 3.1 in 2023, and slightly more next year.

        "date": "April 6, 2023 08:03 am",
        "content": "UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - The United States, Britain, Albania and Malta walked out on Russias envoy for childrens rights - whom the International Criminal Court wants to arrest on war crimes charges - as she spoke by video to U.N. Security Council members on Wednesday. Britain and the United States blocked the informal meeting on Ukraine, convened by Russia to focus on evacuating children from conflict zones, from being webcast by the United Nations. The diplomats left the U.N. conference room where the discussion was being held as Russian Commissioner Maria Lvova-Belova spoke. U.S. Ambassador to the U.N., Linda Thomas-Greenfield, told reporters that the United States joined Britain in blocking the webcast so Lvova-Belova did not have an international podium to spread disinformation and to try to defend her horrible actions that are taking place in Ukraine. The International Criminal Court last month issued an arrest warrant against Russian President Vladimir Putin and Lvova-Belova, accusing them of illegally deporting children from Ukraine and the unlawful transfer of people to Russia from Ukraine since Russia invaded on Feb. 24, 2022. Moscow said the warrants were legally void as Russia was not a signatory to the treaty that established the ICC. Moscow has not concealed a program under which it has brought thousands of Ukrainian children to Russia but presents it as a humanitarian campaign to protect orphans and children abandoned in the war zone. Lvova-Belova said that since February 2022, some 5 million Ukrainians, including 700,000 children, had traveled to Russia. Some 2,000 children were from orphanages and accompanied by custodians, she said, adding that about 1,300 of those children had since returned to Ukraine, while 400 were now in Russian orphanages and 358 children were placed in Russian foster homes. Russia claims it is protecting these children. Instead this is a calculated policy that seeks to erase Ukrainian identity and statehood, British diplomat Asima Ghazi-Bouillon told the meeting, returning to the room after Lvova-Belova had spoken. During her statement Lvova-Belova showed video of Ukrainian children in Russia, then said: I want to stress that unlike the Ukrainian side, we dont use children for propaganda. Russias U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia told reporters last month that the informal meeting had been planned long before the ICC announcement and it was not intended to be a rebuttal of the charges against Putin and Lvova-Belova. Diplomats have said it is rare for a U.N. webcast to be blocked. However, last month China blocked the U.N. webcast of a U.S.-convened informal Security Council meeting on human rights abuses in North Korea. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "date": "April 6, 2023 08:19 am",
        "content": "Sri Lankan cricketer Danushka Gunathilaka, accused of sexually assaulting a woman he met on Tinder, can use Facebook and Instagram again after having his bail altered, Australian media reported. Gunathilaka, 31, applied to vary his bail at Sydneys Downing Centre Local Court on Thursday. He is facing four counts of sexual intercourse without consent and has not yet entered a plea. Gunathilaka was initially banned from using Tinder and other social media platforms when he was granted bail in November 2022. His bail conditions were altered in February so he could return to WhatsApp, an encrypted messaging platform owned by Facebook-parent Meta and popular in his home country, and go out at night. The latest alteration to his bail allows Gunathilaka to use his existing Facebook and Instagram accounts. The court was previously told the alleged victim was being harassed on social media and had to close her accounts. Gunathilakas case has been adjourned for three weeks so the prosecution can gather more information. After matching on Tinder, meeting up for a date and heading back to her home in Sydneys eastern suburbs, the complainant alleges the cricketer refused to wear a condom and choked her three times. The batsman allegedly forced himself on top of the woman, who cannot be identified, when the pair moved to the bedroom. Police claim the woman was uncomfortable and agreed to continue with sexual activity only if Gunathilaka wore a condom. He protested but eventually agreed, police allege in the court documents. The woman told police she later found the condom on the floor beside the bed. Police allege the woman was in shock and did not consent to sex without a condom. She again asked him to use a condom but he refused and instead forcefully engaged in sexual activity, according to police claims. During the several hours he remained at the womans home, Gunathilaka allegedly choked the woman multiple times and slapped her on the buttocks. Police allege the woman was frozen and in shock before the international cricketer asked her to order an Uber for him. He left her home just before 1am. The alleged victim told police she was sore and swollen and unable to work the next day because she couldnt stop crying. Gunathilaka travelled to Australia with Sri Lankas T20 World Cup team last year but only played in their first game before being ruled out of the competition with a hamstring tear. He was arrested in the early hours of October 6 at Sydneys Hyatt Regency Hotel, shortly before he was scheduled to board a flight home with the rest of the team after they bowed out of the tournament. The cricketer was granted leave to move into a one-bedroom apartment in Sydneys inner west before Christmas last year. Gunathilaka previously surrendered his passport and has been ordered not to approach any international departure point as a provision of his bail. His bail was backed by a 150,000 surety provided by a friend of a friend and a further 50,000 provided by the cricketer. Gunathilakas case will return to court on April 27.

        "date": "April 6, 2023 10:44 am",
        "content": "Afghan men working for the United Nations in Kabul will stay home in solidarity with their female colleagues after the Taliban prohibited Afghan women from working for the global organization, according to a senior UN official. Ramiz Alakbarov, the UN Deputy Special Representative, Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator for Afghanistan, called the Talibans decision an unparalleled violation of human rights. The lives of Afghanistan women are at stake, he said, adding, It is not possible to reach women without women. International UN staff in Afghanistan will stay at their posts, he added. The UN said on Wednesday that it had been notified by the Taliban that Afghan women were no longer permitted to work for the UN in Afghanistan and that the measure would be actively enforced. The UN condemned the decision, calling the ban unlawful under international law. Several female UN staff in the country had already experienced restrictions on their movements since the Taliban seized power in 2021, including harassment and detention  prompting the UN to order all its staff of Afghan nationality, of all genders, not to go into the office until further notice, said the statement. The UN Secretary-Generals Special Representative for Afghanistan, Roza Otunbayeva, is engaging with the Taliban at the highest level to seek an immediate reversal of the order, the statement added. The UN said the Talibans move was an extension of a previous ban, enforced last December, that prohibited Afghan women from working for national and international non-governmental organizations. In the history of the United Nations, no other regime has ever tried to ban women from working for the Organization just because they are women. This decision represents an assault against women, the fundamental principles of the UN, and on international law, Otunbayeva said. Other figures within the organization also condemned the move, with the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights calling it utterly despicable. After the Taliban banned female aid workers in December, at least half a dozen major foreign aid groups temporarily suspended their operations in Afghanistan  diminishing the already scarce resources available to a country in dire need of them. The Talibans return to power preceded a deepening humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan, worsening issues that had long plagued the country. After the takeover, the US and its allies froze about 7 billion of the countrys foreign reserves and cut off international funding  crippling an economy heavily dependent on overseas aid. More than 28 million people in Afghanistan  about two thirds of the population  need humanitarian assistance, the UN estimated in March. It added that many families are facing catastrophic hunger and the risk of famine, with food stocks having run out months before the next harvest is due. Since the Taliban returned to power, they have imposed a brutal crackdown on womens rights and freedoms, forbidding women from working in most sectors, accessing some public spaces like parks, or traveling without a guardian for long distances and other daily restrictions. Last December, it banned women from attending university, nine months after barring girls from returning to secondary schools. Source - CNN -Agencies",

An order preventing the CID from taking the detainee to outside locations for investigative purposes, and requesting that the detainees hands and feet be shackled in the event he is taken to any outside locations was also sought by the petitioner. A team of officers from the CID left for Madagascar on 11 March to repatriate Sri Lankan drug kingpin Nadun Chinthaka alias Harak Kata and his infamous accomplice Kudu Salindu, who were arrested while on a visit to the island off the southeastern coast of Africa. The CID officers later returned to Sri Lanka with the notorious drug dealers on 15 March, and obtained an order under the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA) to detain the duo for 90 days.",

        "date": "April 6, 2023 12:14 pm",
        "content": "Indian police have arrested five men accused of conducting a human sacrifice, nearly four years after the discovery of the victims headless body at a Hindu temple left officers baffled. Shanti Shaw, 64, was killed and decapitated with a machete in 2019 after visiting the temple in Guwahati, a city in Indias remote northeast. Police made no headway in the case until Shaws body was finally identified in January, sparking a renewed investigation that tracked down several culprits, with others still at large. The five planned the killing of the woman, Guwahati police commissioner Diganta Barah told reporters late on Tuesday (Apr 4). A total of 12 people took part. Barah said the alleged ringleader, Pradeep Pathak, 52, had orchestrated the killing as part of a religious rite to mark the anniversary of his brothers death. The accused apparently believed that the sacrifice would appease the soul of the deceased, he added. Pathak and four others were taken into custody between Mar 25 and Apr 1, with police still hunting for their remaining seven accomplices. Indias National Crime Records Bureau lodged 103 cases of human sacrifice in the country between 2014 and 2021. Ritual killings are usually conducted to appease deities and are more common in tribal and remote areas, where belief in witchcraft and the occult is widespread. Last year two men were arrested for allegedly killing a six-year-old boy in the capital New Delhi. The culprits, both construction workers, told police they murdered the child as an offering to the Hindu god Shiva to get rich. Source  AFP -Agencies",

        "content": "Australian actor Hugh Jackman has returned to social media with the news that his recent skin cancer tests are all clear. My biopsies came back negative!!! Thank you ALL for the love. I feel it!, he posted. The Wolverine star this week revealed he had undergone tests after a recent medical check-up. Jackman had his first skin cancer removed in 2013, and has since had at least six procedures. The actor repeated his sun-safety message, writing: Please remember to wear sunscreen with a high level of SPF, no matter the season. Jackman took the tests after his doctor noticed little things which could be, or could not be basal cell carcinomas. Basal cell carcinoma is a non-melanoma - which means it is much less likely to spread - and is caused by overexposure to the sun or sunbeds. Treatment for non-melanoma skin cancers are successful in 90 of cases, according to the NHS. Australia is the skin cancer capital of the world, with more than 11,500 people diagnosed with a melanoma and an estimated 434,000 treated for other skin cancers each year. Source - BBC - Agencies",

CEB acquired the power plant on 28 March 2023, after the process was initiated in the latter part of 2022, in accordance with the terms and condition of the Power Purchase Agreement (PPA). The acquisition process was facilitated with the aim of increasing the capacity of electricity generated, in light of the future power requirements of the country. Thus, the CEB-owned 163 MW facility will be compatible with LNG following some minor modifications and thereby enables to reduce the current cost of generation when conversion takes place. Under the GOSL policy framework, CEB signed the PPA with Sojitz Kelanitissa (Pvt)Limited on June, 2000 as an Independent Power Producer (IPP) on BOOT basis. The contract period was for 20 years and the power plant is located in Colombo Kelanitissa Power Plant complex. CEB negotiations were very hard especially due to economic constraints, obstacles, challenges, and many issues including legal aspects; but CEB has managed to overcome those difficulties and finally owned a 163 MW power plant. CEB appreciates all those government entities who have helped immensely to complete the acquiring process successfully, the CEB said in a statement issued in this regard. Further, CEB appreciates Sojitz Kelanitissa (Pvt) Limited for the operation of the power plant for over 19 years and for the cordial cooperation extended during the negotiation and transfer process of the facility, it read.",

        "date": "April 6, 2023 05:07 pm",
        "content": "Hundreds of migrants have been rescued from an overcrowded fishing boat in international waters off Malta after a complex 11-hour operation in stormy seas, the Doctors Without Borders (MSF) charity said on Wednesday. MSF said its Geo Barents vessel struggled with the rescue, concluded late on Tuesday, due to the rough weather and initially could do little more than throw life jackets to the 440 migrants and monitor their situation. Alarm Phone, a charity that picks up distress calls from migrants crossing the central Mediterranean, had warned two days ago that the boat was in difficulty, prompting MSFs intervention. The vessel was practically in the eye of a storm, facing waves of up to 4.5-5 metres and buffeted by winds of up to 40 knots, the Geo Barents rescue operations chief, Riccardo Gatti, said in an audio message distributed by MSF. The migrants, including eight women and 30 children, spent four days at sea, the last two without food or water, after setting off from eastern Libya, near Benghazi, on April 1, MSF said. One of them had fainted due to serious dehydration and was airlifted to Malta via helicopter, a charity spokeswoman said, adding that the group comprises nationals from Syria, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Egypt, Somalia and Sri Lanka. MSF said it was told to take the migrants to the southeastern Italian port of Brindisi, except for a group of 100 who will be handed over to the Italian Coast Guard and brought ashore elsewhere. The Geo Barents is expected to arrive in Brindisi on Friday, Gatti said. Italy is facing a surge in sea migration from North Africa, with more than 28,000 arrivals in the year to date, compared to around 6,800 in the same period of 2022. On Monday the Italian coast guard carried out another difficult rescue as it picked up 32 migrants stuck on a desert islet near Lampedusa island via helicopter. Source  Reuters - Agencies",

The media reports in question, which claim that the Governor anticipates a difficult period ahead in the economy, were deemed a gross misinterpretation of the views expressed by Dr, Weerasinghe. This is a gross misinterpretation of the views expressed by Governor, taken out of the context of the discussion on challenges that the economy could face in the period ahead if the envisaged reforms are delayed or derailed, the statement read. It further explained that Dr. Weerasinghe had merely viewed that should there be any delay or derailment from the envisaged economic adjustment programme, which entails growth enhancing reforms, there could be significant downside risks to the envisaged economic recovery, thereby dampening the economic outlook. The Governor viewed that the difficult and painful policy measures implemented by the Government and the Central Bank thus far have helped to stabilise the economic conditions, compared to the unprecedented socio-economic tensions witnessed in 2022. Despite these reforms having resulted in significant adjustment costs, causing hardship to the people and businesses in the near term, they were necessary to restore stability, which will accrue benefits to the people and businesses in the period ahead, the statement read. Therefore, CBSL has urged the public to refrain from being dissuaded by misquoted media reports published intentionally or otherwise, at this crucial moment of economic recovery from the worst crisis in history.",

Issuing a statement in this regard, the collective highlighted that failing to hold the LG polls in a timely manner would have serious implications for democracy and governance. It would mean that the constitutional right to elect representatives at the local level would be compromised. It will set a dangerous precedent and impair the democratic process, the statement read. They further explained that not holding the election using a lack of finances as an excuse could open the door for using such flimsy pretexts for postponing Parliamentary and Presidential elections, highlighting that this practice , if allowed, will wrongly incentivize leaders who are inclined to not hold elections till it is beneficial for them. Further emphasszing the adverse effects the postponement of the LG polls has had not only on the countrys democracy but also on its institutions, the Civil Society Collective for Protecting the Franchise called upon Sri Lankas international partners to closely monitor the situation, and to ensure that the election is held in a timely manner. They also urged these international institutions to highlight the importance of an election for the countrys stability and economic recovery. It is critical to remain steadfast in advocating for the elections to be held on schedule, and to ensure that the government adheres to the established legal framework. This will serve to preserve the democratic principles upon which Sri Lankan society is founded and to safeguard the right to elect our representatives, the collective said in this regard.

        "date": "April 7, 2023 10:40 am",
        "content": "Security camera footage showing a Sri Lankan woman before her death in a central Japan detention facility was publicly released Thursday for the first time by lawyers representing her family. Approximately 7 minutes of roughly five total hours of government-provided security camera footage showing Ratnayake Liyanage Wishma Sandamali, who died at the age of 33 while being held at the Nagoya Regional Immigration Services Bureau in March 2021, was shown at a press conference in Tokyo. Some of the released footage taken less than two weeks before Wishmas death shows her bedridden and begging officers to take her to hospital after telling them she is unable to move or eat. The footage also included later scenes of an officer and nurse chatting cheerfully while tending to Wishma as she moaned in pain. In an excerpt from the day she was confirmed dead, an officer tries to wake an unresponsive Wishma after reporting over an intercom that her fingertips feel cold. I want the Japanese people to know how my sister suffered and was left to die in an environment where there was no one to help her, Wishmas younger sister Wayomi, 30, said at the press conference Thursday. While Wishmas family and some members of parliament have been able to privately view the footage, which the government submitted as evidence in a lawsuit, it marks the first time a portion of it has been made available to the public. Wishma arrived in Japan in 2017 as a student but was taken into custody at the immigration facility in August 2020 for overstaying her visa. She died on March 6, 2021, after complaining of ill health, which included vomiting and stomachaches, for around a month. Her death sparked national outrage over her treatment, forcing the government a few months later to drop a bill revising rules on foreigners facing deportation, including asylum seekers. The government, however, has resubmitted the bill in the current Diet session, with Chief Cabinet Secretary Hirokazu Matsuno stressing at a press conference Thursday that its early enactment is essential to prevent the recurrence of similar cases and to solve the problem of long-term detention. Wishmas family is seeking damages from the government over her death, alleging she was illegally detained and died due to a lack of necessary medical care. Source: Kyodo News -Agencies",

        "content": "Thousands of people have fled across the border to Thailand amid fierce fighting between Myanmars armed rebel groups and the military, according to Thai officials. Myanmar was plunged into turmoil when the military seized power from the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi in February 2021, leading to mass protests and an armed uprising. Thai officials said the fighting near the border was concentrated near the town of Myawaddy in southern Karen state, also known as Kayin, bordering Thailands Tak province. Around 3,998 people have fled into Thailands temporary shelter across 10 areas, Tak provincial officials said in a statement, adding that the situation was being closely monitored. Thailands Khaosod English newspaper and BBC Burmese said fighting flared after an attack on a border guard post by armed fighters from the Karen National Liberation Army, an ethnic armed group. Many people crossed the border since yesterday and some are still also waiting on the Myanmar side to cross. People dont have enough drinking water or any toilets for now, a charity worker, who asked not to be named, told the Reuters news agency. Since the coup, some ethnic armed groups such as the KNLA, which have been fighting the armed forces for decades, have joined forces with anti-coup groups to try and force the generals from power. Myanmars military has used lethal force against its opponents, killing some 3,212 people according to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners and jailing more than 17,000. It has also turned to air power in its bid to wipe out opposition, with observers accusing the military of targeting civilians in bombings and ground assaults. Entire villages have been burned to the ground. At least eight people, including children, were killed when their village in northwest Myanmar was bombed last week. Myanmars military claims it is fighting terrorists and denies targeting civilians. It blames anti-coup fighters for the deaths of civilians. Source  Al Jazeera - Agencies",

The decision was taken owing to the fact that 28 of the 36 freezers facilitated for the keeping of bodies in the hospitals mortuary have been occupied by unclaimed corpses for the past year and two months. Among these bodies are those handed over by various police stations, and those who died at the hospital, yet remain unclaimed. Revealing that nearly eight to ten bodies are received by the hospital on a daily basis, by way of court orders or other means, the administration of the hospital stressed the need for more space in the mortuary, as out of the 36 freezers, two have been dedicated to preserving body parts and other essential services, thereby leaving them with only six vacant freezers. The administration identified that the main reason for the pile-up of such bodies is the fact that the Police do not conduct the required postmortem examinations. Thus, the Judicial Medical Officer (JMO) of the Kalubowila Teaching Hospital has informed the OICs of all relevant police stations, through the Director of the Hospital, that no unidentified bodies or those without a claimant brought by the Police will be accepted by the hospital, for a temporary period of time.

        "date": "April 7, 2023 04:22 pm",
        "content": "(TRIGGER WARNING: The following article contains potentially disturbing content.) Eight Filipinos were nailed to crosses to reenact Jesus Christs suffering in a gory Good Friday tradition that draws thousands of devotees and tourists to the Philippines despite being rejected by the Catholic Church. The real-life crucifixions in the farming village of San Pedro Cutud in Pampanga province north of Manila resumed after a three-year pause due to the coronavirus pandemic. About a dozen villagers registered but only eight men participated, including 62-year-old sign painter Ruben Enaje, who was nailed to a wooden cross for the 34th time in San Pedro Cutud. In a news conference shortly after his brief crucifixion, Enaje said he prayed for the eradication of the COVID-19 virus and the end of Russias invasion of Ukraine, which has contributed to gas and food prices soaring worldwide. Its just these two countries involved in that war, Russia and Ukraine, but all of us are being affected, said Enaje, who appeared to be well and showed his two bandaged hands to journalists. The father of four said he wanted to end his extraordinary penitence because of his age but would decide with finality before Lent next year. While the pain from the nailing was not as intense as anticipated, he said he always felt edgy before each crucifixion. To be honest, I always feel nervous because I could end up dead on the cross, he told The Associated Press before Fridays nailing. When Im laid down on the cross, my body begins to feel cold, he said. When my hands are tied, I just close my eyes and tell myself, I can do this. I can do this. Surviving nearly unscathed when he fell from a three-story building in 1985 prompted Enaje to undergo the ordeal as thanksgiving for what he considered a miracle. He extended the ritual after loved ones recovered from serious illnesses, one after another, turning him into a village celebrity as the Christ in the Lenten reenactment of the Way of the Cross. Ahead of their crucifixion on a dusty hill, Enaje and the other devotees, wearing thorny crowns of twigs, carried heavy wooden crosses on their backs for more than a kilometer (more than half a mile) in the scorching heat. Village actors dressed as Roman centurions later hammered 4-inch (10-centimeter) stainless steel nails through his palms and feet, then set him aloft on a cross under the sun for about 10 minutes. Other penitents walked barefoot through village streets and beat their bare backs with sharp bamboo sticks and pieces of wood. Some participants in the past opened cuts in the penitents backs using broken glass to ensure the ritual was sufficiently bloody. The gruesome spectacle reflects the Philippines unique brand of Catholicism, which merges church traditions with folk superstitions. Many of the mostly impoverished penitents undergo the ritual to atone for sins, pray for the sick or for a better life, and give thanks for miracles. Church leaders in the Philippines have frowned on the crucifixions and self-flagellations, saying Filipinos can show their deep faith and religious devotion without hurting themselves and by doing charity work instead, such as donating blood. Robert Reyes, a prominent Catholic priest and human rights activist in the country, said the bloody rites reflect the churchs failure to fully educate many Filipinos on Christian tenets, leaving them on their own to explore personal ways of seeking divine help for all sorts of maladies. Folk Catholicism has become deeply entrenched in the local religious culture, Reyes said, citing a chaotic procession of a black statue of Jesus Christ called the Black Nazarene each January, which authorities say draw more than a million devotees each year in one of Asias largest religious festivals. Many bring towels to be wiped on the wooden statue, believing it has powers to cure ailments and ensure good health and a better life. The question is, where were we church people when they started doing this? Reyes asked, saying the clergy should immerse itself in communities more and converse regularly with villagers. If we judge them, well just alienate them. The decadeslong crucifixion tradition, meanwhile, has put impoverished San Pedro Cutud  one of the more than 500 villages in rice-growing Pampanga province  on the map. Organizers said more than 15,000 foreign and Filipino tourists and devotees gathered for the cross nailings in Cutud and two other nearby villages. There was a festive air as villagers peddled bottled water, hats, food and religious items, and police and marshals kept order. They like this because there is really nothing like this on earth, said Johnson Gareth, a British tour organizer, who brought 15 tourists from eight countries, including the United States, Canada and Germany, to witness the crucifixions. Its less gruesome than people think. They think its going to be very macabre or very disgusting but its not. Its done in a very respectful way. In the past, Gareth said tourists were genuinely inspired and I think they left with a newfound respect for peoples beliefs. Source: Associated Press -Agencies",

        "title": "Covid origins: Chinese scientists publish long-awaited data",
        "date": "April 8, 2023 11:16 am",
        "content": "A research team in China has published analysis of samples taken more than three years ago from the market linked to the outbreak of Covid-19. The Huanan seafood and wildlife market has been a focal point in the search for the origin of the coronavirus. But this is the first peer-reviewed study of biological evidence gathered from the market back in 2020. By linking the virus with animals sold in the market, it could open new lines of inquiry into how the outbreak began. The research reveals swabs that tested positive for the virus also contained genetic material from wild animals. Some scientists say this is further evidence that the disease was initially transmitted from an infected animal to a human. But others have urged caution in interpreting the findings and it remains unclear why it took three years for the genetic content of the samples to be made public. Another theory has centred on the suggestion that the virus accidentally leaked from a laboratory in Wuhan. No definitive proof The Chinese research team posted an early version of their study online back in February 2022, but they did not publish the full genetic information that was contained in the samples gathered from the market. In March this year, another international group of researchers shared their own assessment of what those crucial market swabs had revealed, after spotting that the genetic sequences had been posted on a scientific data-sharing website. This new analysis, which has been validated by other scientists before being published in the journal Nature, includes more important detail about the content of those samples, which were collected from stalls, surfaces, cages and machinery inside the market. The Chinese research teams paper showed that some samples - collected from areas where wildlife was being sold - had tested positive for the virus. Their analysis also showed that animals now known to be susceptible to the virus, particularly raccoon dogs, were being sold alive in those locations. But the Chinese researchers have pointed out that their discoveries fall short of definitive proof of how the outbreak started. These environmental samples cannot prove that the animals were infected, the paper explains. The possibility remains, it adds, that the virus was brought into the market by an infected person, rather than an animal. Prof David Robertson, from the University of Glasgow, is a virologist who has been involved in the genetic investigation into the origin of SARS-CoV-2 since it emerged in 2020. He told BBC News: The most important thing is that this very important dataset is now published and available for others to work on. But he added that the contents of the samples were compelling evidence that animals there were probably infected with the virus. Its the whole body of evidence thats important, he said. When you bring this together with the fact that the early Covid-19 cases in Wuhan are linked to the market, its strong evidence that this is where a spillover from an animal in the market occurred. The published findings come amid signs that the lab leak theory is gaining ground among authorities in the US. The Chinese government has strenuously denied suggestions that the virus originated in a scientific facility, but the FBI said it now believes that scenario is the most likely, as does the US Department of Energy. Various US departments and agencies have investigated the mystery and produced differing conclusions, but on 1 March the FBIs director accused Beijing of doing its best to try to thwart and obfuscate, and disclosed the bureau had been convinced of the lab leak theory for quite some time now. The FBI has not made their findings public, which has frustrated some scientists. The lead researcher of the new report, from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC) in Beijing, has been contacted by the BBC for comment. Source: BBC -Agencies",

        "title": "HRW urges Sri Lankan govt to withdraw Anti-Terrorism Bill",
        "date": "April 8, 2023 12:59 pm",
        "content": "The Sri Lankan governments proposed Anti-Terrorism Act would empower the authorities to systematically violate fundamental human rights, Human Rights Watch (HRW) said, calling for the withdrawal of the Bill. The rights group urged the government to ensure, through consultations, that any counterterrorism legislation introduced upholds international human rights standards. Despite the Sri Lankan governments pledges to adopt an improved law following domestic and international criticism of abuses under existing counterterrorism legislation, the HRW said the new bill, instead of addressing the problems, would expand the definition of terrorism to include crimes such as property damage, theft, or robbery, and restrict the rights to freedom of assembly and speech. Speaking in this regard, HRWs South Asia Director Meenakshi Ganguly said the proposed Anti-Terrorism Bill would permit the Sri Lankan government to use draconian measures to silence critics and target minorities. The governments crackdown on dissent and misuse of existing counterterrorism laws to arbitrarily detain protesters highlights the obvious risk of abuse. The Sri Lankan government published the new Anti-Terrorism Bill in a bid to replace the widely-criticized Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA). The HRW said the new Bill, despite its improvements, includes provisions that will facilitate abuse, and that it appears to have been designed to give the President, the police, and military broad powers to detain people without evidence, to make vaguely defined forms of speech a criminal offence. It will also make room for arbitrary banning of gatherings and organizations without meaningful judicial oversight, the HRW said, raising concerns. The Anti-Terrorism Bill does not meet any of the necessary prerequisites set out by the UN independent expert on human rights and counterterrorism to make sure that the island nations counterterrorism law complies with international rights standards. The prerequisites called for provision of an appropriate definition of terrorism, ensuring of precision and legal certainty, provisions to prevent arbitrary detention, measures that adhere to the absolute prohibition on torture, and due process and fair trial guarantees including judicial oversight. The HRW said the new Bills definition of terrorism is vague and overboard and can include peaceful protest or acts that, while criminal, do not rise to the level of any reasonable definition of terrorism. Offenses include participation in certain unlawful assemblies if the aim is to intimidate the public or wrongfully compel the government to act in a certain way, as well as theft or robbery of government or private property, even if these acts are not intended to cause death or serious harm. The rights group further noted that while under the PTA, the authorities can detain a suspect for up to a year on orders signed by the defense minister, the proposed bill gives the authority to issue detention orders to deputy inspector generals of police, increasing risk of abuse. The proposed Bill grants police and military sweeping powers to stop, question, search, and arrest anyone, or seize any document or object without a warrant, if they believe they have reasonable grounds, the HRW went on to note. It also provides the president power to issue regulations for rehabilitation programs if the attorney general has decided to defer or suspend prosecution, the HRW said adding that the attorney general could then impose voluntary rehabilitation on a person who has not been convicted of any crime. If the Bill is passed, the president, on the advice of the police or military, would be authorized to declare any location a prohibited place, with up to three years in prison for violations, the HRW continued. This appears to be an attempt to prevent a repetition of the largely peaceful 2022 protests in the capital, Colombo. The HRW further said the Bill expands broad powers to criminalize speech that is likely to be understood as encouragement or inducement to commit or prepare for terrorism, with the burden of proof on the defendant to show that was not their intention. The president would be authorized to ban an organization if authorities have reasonable grounds to believe it is acting in a manner prejudicial to the national security of Sri Lanka, or any other country. Although Sri Lanka has observed a moratorium on executions since 1976, HRW said the Bill provides for the death penalty for the terrorism offense of murder. Sri Lanka should abolish the death penalty, which Human Rights Watch opposes in all circumstances because of its inherent cruelty and finality.",
