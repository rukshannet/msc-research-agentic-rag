        "title": "South Korean police search President Yoons office over martial law imposition, reports say",
        "date": "December 11, 2024 08:34 am",
        "content": "Yonhap news agency says police are searching President Yoon Suk Yeols office. Yonhap says the search is happening on Wednesday over Yoons Dec. 3 martial law declaration. Police didnt immediately confirm the report. The reported search happens as the countrys main law enforcement institutions are focusing on finding whether Yoon and others involved in the Dec. 3 martial law imposition committed rebellion. South Koreas two highest police officers have been detained to be investigated for their roles in enforcing President Yoon Suk Yeols short-lived martial law decree last week, police said Wednesday. The development comes hours before the main liberal opposition Democratic Party submits a new motion to impeach Yoon as the countrys main law enforcement institutions expand their investigation into whether the presidents declaration amounted to rebellion. The first impeachment attempt failed last Saturday when the ruling party boycotted the vote. The Democratic Party said it aims to put the new motion to a vote on Saturday. Yoons ill-conceived power grab has paralyzed South Korean politics, frozen its foreign policy, and rattled financial markets, greatly reducing his chances of completing his five-year term and casting a turbulent shadow over one of Asias most robust democracies. After last weeks impeachment motion fell through, the leader of Yoons conservative party pledged to arrange his stable exit from power, saying the party will coordinate with Cabinet members over state affairs and that Yoon will be sidelined from duties during a transition to an early election. However, the plans have been widely criticized as unrealistic and unconstitutional. The constitution explicitly states that impeachment is the sole method for suspending presidential powers and that the authority to command the military rests solely with the president. The Defense Ministry said this week that Yoon remains in charge of the countrys military forces. Earlier Wednesday, Yoons former defense minister, Kim Yong Hyun, was arrested after a Seoul court approved a warrant for him on allegations of playing a key role in a rebellion and committing abuse of power. Kim became the first person arrested over the Dec. 3 martial law decree. Police said National Police Agency Commissioner General Cho Ji Ho and Kim Bong-sik, head of the metropolitan police agency of the capital, Seoul, were being held at Seouls Namdaemun police station. They have been investigated for their roles in deploying police forces to the National Assembly in an attempt to block lawmakers from entering the parliament to vote to lift Yoons martial law decree, which was abruptly announced on the night of Dec. 3. The Assembly was also encircled by heavily armed troops, which military commanders say were deployed on the orders of the former defense minister. But enough lawmakers eventually managed to enter a parliament chamber and unanimously rejected Yoons decree, forcing the Cabinet to lift it before daybreak on Dec. 4. During a parliamentary hearing Tuesday, Kwak Jong-keun, commander of the Army Special Warfare Command whose troops were sent to parliament, testified that he received direct instructions from Kim Yong Hyun to obstruct lawmakers from entering the Assemblys main chamber. Kwak said the purpose of Kims instructions was to prevent the 300-member parliament from gathering the 150 votes necessary to overturn Yoons martial law order. Kwak said Yoon later called him directly and asked for the troops to quickly destroy the door and drag out the lawmakers who are inside. Kwak said he discussed Yoons order with the commander at the scene and that they concluded there was nothing that could be done, ruling out the possibility of threatening the lawmakers by shooting blanks or cutting off electricity. At the same hearing, senior officer Kim Dae-woo of the militarys counterintelligence agency said his commander, Yeo In-hyung, asked him if an army bunker in Seoul had space to detain politicians and other figures after martial law was imposed. Yeo is considered a close associate of Kim Yong Hyun. Last week, Hong Jang-won, a deputy director of the countrys spy agency, said Yoon ordered him to help Yeos command to detain some of his political rivals but he ignored the presidents order. Kwak and Yeo are among those who face opposition-raised rebellion charges along with Yoon and Kim, and the Defense Ministry suspended them last week. If Yoon is impeached, his presidential powers would be suspended until the Constitutional Court decides whether to restore his powers or remove him from office. If he is dismissed from office, a new presidential election would be required. Opposition parties and many experts say the martial law decree was unconstitutional. They say a president is by law allowed to declare martial law only during wartime, war-like situations or other comparable national emergency states and South Korea wasnt in such a situation. They argue that deploying troops to seal the National Assembly to suspend its political activities amounted to rebellion because the South Korean Constitution doesnt allow a president to use the military to suspend parliament in any situation. In his martial law announcement, the conservative Yoon stressed a need to rebuild the country by eliminating shameless North Korea followers and anti-state forces, a reference to his liberal rivals who control parliament. Since taking office in 2022, Yoon has had near-constant friction with the main liberal opposition Democratic Party, which introduced motions to impeach some of his top officials and launched a political offensive over scandals involving Yoon and his wife. On Wednesday, North Koreas state news agency for the first time reported about the political turmoil and street protests triggered by Yoons martial law decree. The report mostly attempted to explain the South Korean events though it used its typical abusive language like calling Yoon a traitor and his military gangsters. Many experts say North Korea is sensitive to the domestic spread of news on massive anti-government protests in foreign countries because its own people have no official access to international news and could be affected by such events.

        "date": "December 11, 2024 08:53 am",
        "content": "Indias Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone Ltd said on Tuesday it would finance its Colombo port terminal project through internal accruals and a capital management plan, withdrawing its request for funding from the US International Development Finance Corp (DFC). DFC last year said it would provide 553 million in financing for the port terminal project, which is partly owned by the Adani Group. The company, however, said the Colombo West International Terminal project is progressing well and is on track for commissioning by early 2025. DFC did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. Ports-to-edible oils Adani Group, controlled by Indian billionaire Gautam Adani, holds a 51 stake in the west container terminal of the port, which also has a terminal run by China Merchants Port Holdings Co Ltd. Sri Lankan conglomerate John Keells Holdings owns 34 of the terminal and the rest is held by the state-run Sri Lanka Ports Authority. Last month, US authorities accused Adani Group Chairman Gautam Adani and seven others of being part of a 265 million scheme to bribe Indian officials, and of misleading US investors while raising funds there. The ports-to-power conglomerate has termed the allegations baseless and said it would seek all possible legal recourse. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "date": "December 11, 2024 09:09 am",
        "content": "The Technical Engineers and Supervisors Association of the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) allege that the state-owned electricity provider has procured electricity from private thermal power plants, even as reservoir levels associated with hydro-power plants are at their maximum as a result of recent heavy rainfall. Speaking on the matter, the associations Vice President, Nandana Udayakumara, called for an investigation into the decision, questioning whose interests are being served by such actions. We have had significant rainfall recently, sufficient to fill the reservoirs powering our hydro-power plants. Additionally, the Norochcholai coal power plant currently has sufficient coal stocks to operate at full capacity, Udayakumara said. He highlighted a discrepancy in operational data, noting, Last week, the CEBs records indicate that only two-thirds of the Norochcholai coal power plant was functioning. Furthermore, one of the units was operating at low capacity. Despite these conditions, electricity was still purchased from private thermal power plants. The association emphasized the questionable timing of the purchases, especially when hydro-power plants could operate at maximum capacity alongside the fully operational Norochcholai plant. In this situation, when hydro-power and Norochcholai are capable of meeting the demand, the decision to rely on thermal power plants raises serious concerns. For whose benefit was this electricity bought? Udayakumara questioned.",

        "date": "December 11, 2024 09:10 am",
        "content": "The Israeli military announced on Tuesday that it conducted approximately 480 airstrikes over the past 48 hours, targeting key military installations across Syria. This escalation comes days after the removal of President Bashar al-Assad from power. Within the last 48 hours, the IDF (Israel Defense Forces) struck most of the strategic weapons stockpiles in Syria, preventing them from falling into the hands of terrorist elements, the Israeli military said. The strikes reportedly destroyed naval vessels, anti-aircraft systems, and weapons production sites across major cities, including Damascus, Homs, Tartus, Latakia, and Palmyra. According to the IDF, 350 of the strikes involved manned aircraft targeting critical assets such as airfields, drones, missiles, tanks, and fighter jets. The remaining strikes supported ground operations, focusing on weapons depots, launchers, and firing positions. Additionally, Israeli naval forces hit two Syrian naval facilities, destroying 15 docked vessels and sea-to-sea missile stockpiles. The strikes come amidst a broader regional shift, with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu describing Assads ouster as a turning point. The collapse of the Syrian regime is a direct result of the severe blows with which we have struck Hamas, Hezbollah, and Iran, Netanyahu said during a press conference on Monday. As I promised, we are changing the face of the Middle East. Israeli leaders have expressed concern about the uncertainty following Assads downfall. While celebrating the removal of an ally of Iran and Hezbollah, officials worry about the potential rise of radical Islamist factions governing Syria. Foreign minister Gideon Saar emphasized the importance of immediate action to safeguard Israels security. We are targeting military facilities housing chemical weapons and long-range missiles to prevent them from falling into the hands of extremists, he said on Monday. Source: Times of India --Agencies",

        "date": "December 11, 2024 09:30 am",
        "content": "Sri Lankas regulatory environment for the insurance sector is regarded as developing with limited transparency, according to Fitch Ratings. In a report, Fitch cited the Insurance Regulatory Commission of Sri Lanka which oversees domestic insurers. It introduced a risk-based capital (RBC) regime in 2015, which was fully adopted by insurers in 2016. The regime required insurers to maintain a minimum RBC ratio of 120, and those with a ratio below 160 are required to submit a plan to improve their capitalisation levels. The commission also enforces the segregation of life and non-life insurance businesses and requires all insurers to list on the local stock exchange to enhance transparency. However, exemptions are provided to insurers whose parent companies are listed on a recognised stock exchange. Sri Lankas insurance market has one of the lowest penetration rates in Asia and is characterised by a lack of sophistication, with basic products dominating both the life and non-life segments, according to Fitch Ratings. In the non-life segment, motor insurance accounts for over half of the premiums. However, prolonged restrictions on motor vehicle imports have driven insurers to diversify into other areas, such as health and miscellaneous insurance. Fire, property, and small and medium-sized enterprise insurance are also experiencing growth, supported by increasing construction activity and a rising number of businesses. In the life insurance sector, traditional whole-life and endowment policies with investment features remain dominant. Whilst pure protection-type policies are gaining some traction, they still lag behind other Asian markets due to limited local demand, Fitch noted. Source: Insurance Asia --Agencies",

        "date": "December 11, 2024 11:59 am",
        "content": "The Epidemiology Unit of the Ministry of Health says that an unidentified fever is spreading in the Jaffna District, raising concerns among health authorities. The health authorities have launched investigations to determine the nature of the disease, with preliminary tests underway to assess whether it is related to leptospirosis, commonly known as rat fever. Dr. Kumudu Weerakoon of the Epidemiology Unit addressed the issue at a media briefing held at the Health Promotion Bureau today (11). She explained that patients in the affected areas are presenting with fever and respiratory issues. Health officials are collecting samples from these individuals to confirm the exact cause of the illness, Dr. Weerakoon added. Leptospirosis continues to be a major health concern in Sri Lanka. In 2023, the country recorded over 9,000 cases of rat fever, resulting in nearly 200 deaths. Dr. Weerakoon revealed that the number of reported cases this year has already surpassed those recorded during the same period last year. She emphasized that individuals engaged in occupations involving exposure to water and mud, such as paddy farming and mining, as well as those affected by floods, are particularly vulnerable to the disease. Dr. Weerakoon highlighted the symptoms of leptospirosis, which include high fever, severe muscle pain, red eyes, vomiting, headache, body aches, blood in urine, and decreased urination. If untreated, the illness can cause significant damage to vital organs such as the kidneys, liver, and brain, and in severe cases, it can be fatal. She stressed the importance of early detection and treatment to prevent complications and save lives. To combat the spread of the disease, the Ministry of Health is providing free antibiotics to individuals at high risk, including those involved in water-related occupations. These antibiotics can be obtained from Public Health Inspectors attached to the relevant Medical Officer of Health offices, Dr. Weerakoon noted. Dr. Weerakoon urged individuals experiencing symptoms to seek immediate medical attention, noting that timely intervention is critical to recovery. During the recent heavy rainfall across the island due to the cyclone Fengal caused severe flooding in Jaffna after years, displacing thousands of individuals. The historic Nallur Temple, a significant cultural landmark in Jaffna, had also been inundated by the floods, while the A9 main road to Jaffna was also flooded at Omanthai.",

Accordingly, this makes him eligible to play all forms of cricket effective from today (11). After the consideration of an appeal made by Dickwella, the appeal panel has declared that as per the medical evidence it is clearly established that the player has consumed a substance of abuse out-of-competition and that it is unrelated to sports performance. Accordingly, the panel has stated that therefore, they are of the view that the player Niroshan Dickwellas 3 years ineligibility period imposed by the disciplinary panel, should be reduced to 3 months ineligibility period, commencing from 13 August 2024. Furthermore, the panel has mentioned that this decision balances the players right to fair consideration with the principles of anti-doping, ensuring fairness while maintaining the integrity of sport. The appeal panel which considered Dickwellas appeal consisted of Retired Judge Upali Samaraweera, Prof. Asela Mendis and Attorney-at-Law Gimhana Jagodaarachchi. Attorney-at-Law Suminda Perera with Senior Attorney-at-Law Ranil Prematilake appeared for Niroshan Dickwella. On August 16, Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) confirmed that Dickwella was suspended from participating in all forms of cricket with immediate effect due to an alleged anti-doping violation.

        "content": "Another dispute has emerged within the New Democratic Front (NDF) concerning the nomination of Faiszer Musthapha for a National List MP position with the coalition partners alleging that this decision has been made without consulting them. When inquired by Ada Derana, former Parliamentarian Ramesh Pathirana stated that there was unanimous agreement to appoint former Minister Kanchana Wijesekera to the remaining National List MP position. However, the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP), a key partner in the NDF, had proposed Faiszer Musthaphas name for the position. The NDF, which contested under the gas cylinder symbol in the 2024 general elections, secured two National List seats. The other National List MP seat had been filled by former minister Ravi Karunanayake of the UNP, also under somewhat controversial circumstances. Accordingly, it had been proposed to name one member each from the Podujana Eksath Nidahas Peramuna and the United National Party (UNP) for the two National List seats while the final decision on the matter was expected to be taken collectively by all parties in the alliance. A proposal had also been put forward to nominate former Minister Kanchana Wijesekera, who contested the election from Matara District but was not elected, for the position of National List MP from the Podujana Eksath Nidahas Peramuna faction while a decision was yet to be taken on the other seat. However, despite this the name of Ravi Karunanayake had been sent to the Election Commission on November 18, in writing by the General Secretary of the NDF, Mrs. Sharmila Perera, nominating him for one of the National List MP seats of the New Democratic Front. This move had come under intense backlash from wihitn the alliance with it also being reported that former President Wickremesinghe had informed the representatives of the New Democratic Front that Karunanayakes name had been forwarded for the position of National List MP in an arbitrary manner without his consent and the approval of the other parties in the alliance. A committee was later appointed to look into the matter.",

        "content": "The Supreme Court today (11) adjourned the hearing of petitions seeking an order to re-conduct the 2024 Grade 5 Scholarship Examination, following allegations that three questions in the exam had been leaked. The petitions were heard before a Supreme Court bench comprising Justices S. Thurairaja and Shiran Gunaratne. However, the hearing was adjourned to December 16, as the three-member bench required to adjudicate the matter was not properly constituted. The petitions were filed by a group of students who sat for the examination and their parents, expressing concerns over the fairness of the process. On December 2, the Attorney General (AG) informed the Supreme Court that the Cabinet of Ministers had recommended awarding free marks to all students for the three disputed questions. Appearing on behalf of the AG, Solicitor General Viraj Dayaratne stated that the Cabinet of Ministers stance was that it is not necessary to re-conduct the examination for this question paper, considering the potential stress it could cause to the students. On September 20, an investigation was launched by the Department of Examinations after it was alleged that three questions of one of the question papers from the exam had been leaked. Later, the initial investigation report was handed over to the Criminal Investigation Department (CID), which also launched a separate investigation into the matter. The investigations had uncovered that only three questions from the exam had been leaked in advance. However, the incident stirred controversy as a group of parents, holding press conferences and staging protests on several occasions, had claimed that the entire question paper had been leaked. Against this backdrop, the Director of the Planning Division of the National Institute of Education (NIE) in Maharagama and a school teacher, who were arrested by the Criminal Investigations Department (CID) over the question paper issue, were remanded until October 22. The arrested 58-year-old NIE Director was a member of the committee which prepared the 2024 Grade 05 Scholarship Examination paper, and the 49-year-old teacher had been conducting tuition classes for Grade 05 students. The parents raised the issue with President Anura Kumara Dissanayake, and as a result, the evaluation of the answer sheets for the scholarship examination was suspended until the investigation was completed. On October 14, the Commissioner General of Examinations Amith Jayasundara announced that it was decided not to re-conduct the 2024 Grade 05 Scholarship Examination. Furthermore, it had been decided to award free marks to all students for the 03 questions which were alleged to have been leaked. However in November, the Supreme Court issued an interim order preventing the release of results of the 2024 Grade 5 Scholarship Examination.",

        "date": "December 11, 2024 05:05 pm",
        "content": "Myanmars economy is forecast to contract this year, the World Bank said Wednesday, as flooding and fighting take a severe toll nearly four years after the military ousted its elected government headed by Aung San Suu Kyi. In an update issued Wednesday, the bank said about a fifth of all built structures and a tenth of Myanmars roads had been damaged by widespread flooding during heavy monsoon rains and a typhoon that swept through the country in September. About 2 million people were left homeless, the report said. Meanwhile, fighting between the military and opposition forces remains fierce in some parts of the country, disrupting farming and manufacturing. The level and intensity of armed conflict remains high, severely affecting lives and livelihoods, disrupting production and supply chains, and heightening uncertainty around the economic outlook, it said. Overall, the report said the economy will likely contract 1 in annual terms in the April-March fiscal year. Pro-democracy guerrillas and ethnic minority armed forces seeking autonomy have been battling the Myanmar army after it took power in early 2021, when generals ousted the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi. The United Nations estimates that 3.5 million people, or about 6 of the population, have been displaced from their homes, more than half the countrys townships are embroiled in conflict and construction of major projects has been delayed, the report said. The U.N. special envoy for Myanmar recently warned that the Southeast Asian nation is in crisis, with conflict escalating, criminal networks out of control and human suffering at unprecedented levels. Julie Bishop, a former Australian foreign minister, warned that Myanmar risks becoming a forgotten crisis. Adding to the troubles, disruptions from the conflict have helped to undermine the value of Myanmars currency, the kyat, which lost 40 of its value against the dollar in informal trading in the first eight months of the year, the World Bank report said. That helped push inflation to more than 25, while food prices increased more than 60 between April and September, it said. Arrivals of international tourists are at about one-fifth the level before double shocks of the COVID-19 pandemic and the military takeover, and manufacturing has also weakened as electricity blackouts disrupt production. Myanmars military administration stopped publishing trade data in mid-2024, the report said, but an analysis of data from its trading partners showed that garments and natural gas exports, which account for a large share of all its exports, fell more than 11 in April-September from a year earlier. The reports assessment of the outlook was for a further deterioration in conditions if fighting intensifies. Source: The Associated Press --Agencies",

        "date": "December 12, 2024 09:30 am",
        "content": "The U.N. General Assembly overwhelmingly approved resolutions Wednesday demanding an immediate ceasefire in Gaza and backing the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees that Israel has moved to ban. The votes in the 193-nation world body were 158-9, with 13 abstentions to demand a ceasefire now and 159-9 with 11 abstentions in support of the agency known as UNRWA. The votes culminated two days of speeches overwhelmingly calling for an end to the 14-month war between Israel and the militant Hamas group and demanding access throughout Gaza to address the growing humanitarian catastrophe. Israel and its close ally, the United States, were in a tiny minority speaking and voting against the resolutions. Other opposing both resolutions included Argentina, Papua New Guinea, Paraguay and Tonga. While Security Council resolutions are legally binding, General Assembly resolutions are not, though they do reflect world opinion. There are no vetoes in the assembly. The Palestinians and their supporters went to the General Assembly after the U.S. vetoed a Security Council resolution on Nov. 20 demanding an immediate Gaza ceasefire. It was supported by the councils 14 other members but the U.S. objected that it was not linked to an immediate release of hostages taken by Hamas militants during their attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, which triggered the war. The Palestinian U.N. Ambassador Riyad Mansour expressed gratitude for the overwhelming support for both resolutions Wednesday, saying the votes reflect the resolve and the determination of the international community. We will keep knocking on the doors of the Security Council and the General Assembly until we see an immediate and unconditional ceasefire put in place and until we see humanitarian assistance being distributed at scale in all corners of the Gaza Strip, he said. The language of the resolution adopted by the assembly on a ceasefire mirrors the text of the vetoed council resolution. It demands an immediate, unconditional and permanent cease-fire to be respected by all parties, while also reiterating a demand for the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages. That language is much stronger than General Assembly resolutions adopted on Oct. 27, 2023  three weeks after the Hamas attack  calling for an immediate and sustained humanitarian truce leading to a cessation of hostilities and on Dec. 12, 2023, demanding an immediate humanitarian ceasefire. The resolution adopted Wednesday also marked the first time Germany and Italy, who abstained last December, voted in favor of a Gaza ceasefire. Their support left the United States as the only member of the Group of 7 major industrialized nations still opposed. On the humanitarian front, the resolution rejects any effort to starve Palestinians and demands immediate access to civilians to provide aid indispensable to their survival. The second resolution backs the mandate of UNRWA, which was established by the General Assembly in 1949. It deplores laws adopted by Israels parliament on Oct. 28 banning UNRWAs activities in the Palestinian territories, a measure to take effect in 90 days. It reiterates U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres statements that UNRWA is the backbone of all humanitarian operations in Gaza and no organization can replace it. And it reaffirms the necessity for UNRWAs continued unimpeded operation. The resolution calls on the Israeli government to abide by its international obligations, respect the privileges and immunities of UNRWA and uphold its responsibility to facilitate the unhindered delivery of aid humanitarian assistance throughout the entire Gaza Strip. Israel alleges that around a dozen of UNRWAs 13,000 workers in Gaza participated in Hamas attacks on Israel that precipitated the war. It recently provided the U.N. with over 100 names of UNRWA staff it accuses of having militant ties. U.S. deputy U.N. ambassador Robert Wood reiterated Americas opposition to the ceasefire resolution ahead of Wednesdays vote and criticized the Palestinians for again failing to mention Hamas Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel. At a time when Hamas is feeling isolated due to the ceasefire in Lebanon, the draft resolution on a ceasefire in Gaza risks sending a dangerous message to Hamas that theres no need to negotiate or release the hostages, he said. The Hamas attack killed about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and saw another 250 abducted as hostages. Gaza militants have not returned around 100 hostages, a third of them believed to be dead, and ceasefire efforts have ground to a halt. Israels retaliatory offensive has killed over 44,000 Palestinians in Gaza, according to the local Health Ministry. It says women and children make up more than half the dead but does not distinguish between fighters and civilians in its count. Wood said the U.S. will continue to seek a diplomatic solution to the war and called UNRWA a critical lifeline to the Palestinian people. But he said the UNRWA resolution has serious flaws because it fails to create a path to restore trust between the U.N. agency and Israel  despite U.S. efforts and a U.S. proposal. Just before the vote, Israels U.N. Ambassador Danny Danon accused the resolutions supporters of complicity with Hamas, which he said has hopelessly infiltrated UNRWA, and denounced their failure to link a ceasefire to the release of the hostages. By demanding a ceasefire today without addressing the hostages, this assembly will once again side with those who weaponize human suffering, Danon said. It will send a message that the lives of innocent Israelis, including children, are not worth your consideration. This is not diplomacy, he stressed. It is appeasement. It is enabling terror and abandoning the innocent. Slovenias U.N. Ambassador Samuel bogar, reflecting the views of many speakers, pointed to the tens of thousands killed in Gaza. Gaza doesnt exist anymore, he told the assembly Wednesday. It is destroyed. Civilians are facing hunger, despair and death. Source: AP --Agencies",

        "date": "December 12, 2024 06:02 pm",
        "content": "Samsung has accused Indias competition watchdog of unlawfully detaining its employees and seizing data in a raid carried out in connection with an antitrust investigation on Amazon and Walmarts Flipkart, a legal filing shows. Samsung is embroiled in the Competition Commission of Indias (CCI) investigation that in August concluded that the South Korean giant and other smartphone companies broke anti-trust laws by colluding with Amazon (AMZN.O), opens new tab and Flipkart to exclusively launch products online. Samsungs Oct. 11 filing in the High Court in northern city of Chandigarh seeks to quash the investigation findings related to conduct of the company, arguing the CCI had illegally seized material from its employees during a 2022 raid at one of Amazons vendors. Three Samsung employees were present in the vicinity of the search when the watchdogs officials detained them, seized their phones and copied all the confidential and privileged data, the company said in its 32-page filing, which hasnt been made public. The entire search exercise undertaken ... is patently illegal and any material collected thereunder should not be relied upon and should be promptly returned, the Indian unit of South Koreas Samsung Electronics (005930.KS), opens new tab wrote. The CCI should be prohibited from using or relying upon the data and information unlawfully collected, it added. Samsung and the CCI did not respond to Reuters queries. Samsung has obtained an injunction from the High Court that has put on hold the CCI proceedings, but the court has not yet ruled on its requests to return the data seized and to not allow the commission to rely on it. The CCI has challenged Samsung and 22 other parties that have won similar injunctions from high courts across India, and last week asked the Supreme Court to hear all challenges together, saying the companies were trying to scuttle the investigation. The CCI investigation had found that Amazon and Flipkart both breached competition laws by favouring select sellers on their platforms. Amazon and Flipkart have repeatedly denied wrongdoing, even as brick-and-mortar retailers continue to complain about their deep discounting and other practices. In its court filing Samsung also asserted that it was wrongly found to have breached competition laws in collusion with Amazon and Flipkart, even though it had been cooperating with the watchdog and providing information only as a third-party in the case. The inclusion of smartphone makers in the Amazon and Flipkart investigation could increase legal and compliance headaches for the likes of Samsung. In the August investigation reports, the CCI noted that Samsung was involved in the practice of exclusive phone launches on Amazon and Flipkart, saying exclusivity in business is anathema and against free and fair competition. According to Counterpoint Research Samsung is one of Indias biggest smartphone player with a 14 market share. Datum Intelligence estimates that 50 of phone sales were online last year, up from 14.5 in 2013. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "title": "Queensland to impose adult prison sentences on children",
        "date": "December 12, 2024 08:14 pm",
        "content": "The Australian state of Queensland has passed laws which will see children as young as 10 subject to the same penalties as adults if convicted of crimes such as murder, serious assault and break-ins. The government says the harsher sentencing rules are in response to community outrage over crimes being perpetrated by young offenders and will act as a deterrent. But many experts have pointed to research showing that tougher penalties do not reduce youth offending, and can in fact exacerbate it. The United Nations has also criticised the reforms, arguing they disregard conventions on the human rights of children and violate international law. The Liberal National Party (LNP) - which won the state election in October - made the rules a hallmark of its campaign, saying they put the rights of victims ahead of the rights of criminals. These laws are for every Queenslander who has ever felt unsafe and been a victim of youth crime across our state, Premier David Crisafulli said after parliament passed the bill on Thursday. Leading up to the vote, both sides of politics had claimed that Queensland was in the grips of a youth crime wave, and that a more punitive approach was necessary to combat the issue. But data from the Australian bureau of statistics, shows that youth crime has halved in Queensland across the past 14 years, that it hit its lowest rate in recorded history in 2022, and has remained relatively steady since. Figures from the Queensland Police Service and the Australian Institute of Criminology also demonstrate a clear downward trend. Dubbed by the government as adult crime, adult time, the new laws list 13 offences which will now be subject to harsher prison sentences when committed by youths, including mandatory life detention for murder, with a non-parole period of 20 years. Previously, the maximum penalty for young offenders convicted of murder was 10 years in jail, with life imprisonment only considered if the crime was particularly heinous. The laws also remove detention as a last resort provisions - which favour non-custodial orders, such as fines or community service, for children rather than incarceration - and will make it possible for judges to consider a childs full criminal history when sentencing. The Queensland Police Union has called the changes a leap forward in the right direction, while Queenslands new Attorney-General Deb Frecklington says it will give courts the ability to better address patterns of offending and hold people accountable for their actions. But in a summary, Frecklington also noted the changes were in direct conflict with international standards, that Indigenous children would be disproportionately impacted and that more youngsters were likely to be held in police cells for extended periods because detention centres are full. Queensland already has more children in detention than any other Australian state or territory. Premier Crisafulli said on Thursday that although there may be pressure in the short-term his government had a long-term plan to deliver a raft of other detention facilities and different options. Australias commissioner for children, Anne Hollonds, described the changes as an international embarrassment. She also accused Queenslands government of ignoring evidence which suggests the younger a child comes into contact with the justice system, the more likely it is that they will continue to commit more serious crimes. The fact that the bills provisions are targeting our most at-risk children makes this retreat from human rights even more shocking, she said in a statement on Wednesday. Other legal experts, who gave evidence to a parliamentary hearing on the bill last week, said the laws could have unintended consequences for victims, with children being less likely to plead guilty given the tougher sentences, resulting in more trials and longer court delays.

        "date": "December 12, 2024 09:51 pm",
        "content": "President Joe Biden is commuting the sentences of roughly 1,500 people who were released from prison and placed on home confinement during the coronavirus pandemic and is pardoning 39 Americans convicted of nonviolent crimes. Its the largest single-day act of clemency in modern history. The commutations announced Thursday are for people who have served out home confinement sentences for at least one year after they were released. Prisons were uniquely bad for spreading the virus and some inmates were released in part to stop the spread. At one point, 1 in 5 prisoners had COVID-19, according to a tally kept by The Associated Press. Biden said he would be taking more steps in the weeks ahead and would continue to review clemency petitions. The second largest single-day act of clemency was by Barack Obama, with 330, shortly before leaving office in 2017. America was built on the promise of possibility and second chances, Biden said in a statement. As president, I have the great privilege of extending mercy to people who have demonstrated remorse and rehabilitation, restoring opportunity for Americans to participate in daily life and contribute to their communities, and taking steps to remove sentencing disparities for non-violent offenders, especially those convicted of drug offenses. The clemency follows a broad pardon for his son Hunter, who was prosecuted for gun and tax crimes. Biden is under pressure from advocacy groups to pardon broad swaths of people, including those on federal death row, before the Trump administration takes over in January. Hes also weighing whether to issue preemptive pardons to those who investigated Trumps effort to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election and are facing possible retribution when he takes office. Clemency is the term for the power the president has to pardon, in which a person is relieved of guilt and punishment, or to commute a sentence, which reduces or eliminates the punishment but doesnt exonerate the wrongdoing. Its customary for a president to grant mercy at the end of his term, using the power of the office to wipe away records or end prison terms. Those pardoned Thursday had been convicted of nonviolent crimes such as drug offenses and turned their lives around, White House lawyers said. They include a woman who led emergency response teams during natural disasters; a church deacon who has worked as an addiction counselor and youth counselor; a doctoral student in molecular biosciences; and a decorated military veteran. The president had previously issued 122 commutations and 21 other pardons. Hes also broadly pardoned those convicted of use and simple possession of marijuana on federal lands and in the District of Columbia, and pardoned former U.S. service members convicted of violating a now-repealed military ban on consensual gay sex. Rep. Jim McGovern, D-Mass., and 34 other lawmakers are urging the president to pardon environmental and human rights lawyer Steven Donziger, who was imprisoned or under house arrest for three years because of a contempt of court charge related to his work representing Indigenous farmers in a lawsuit against Chevron. Others are advocating for Biden to commute the sentences of federal death row prisoners. His attorney general, Merrick Garland, paused federal executions. Biden had said on the campaign trail in 2020 that he wanted to end the death penalty but he never did, and now, with Trump coming back into office, its likely executions will resume. During his first term, Trump presided over an unprecedented number of federal executions, carried out during the height of the pandemic. More clemency grants are coming before Biden leaves office on Jan. 20, but its not clear whether hell take action to guard against possible prosecution by Trump, an untested use of the power. The president has been taking the idea seriously and has been thinking about it for as much as six months  before the presidential election  but has been concerned about the precedent it would set, according to people familiar with the matter who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity to discuss internal discussions. But those who received the pardons would have to accept them. New California Sen. Adam Schiff, who was a part of the House committee that investigated the violent Jan. 6 insurrection, said such a pardon from Biden would be unnecessary, and that the president shouldnt be spending his waning days in office worrying about this. For Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., another target of Trumps threats, said in a statement this week that his suggestion that she and others be jailed for the investigations is a continuation of his assault on the rule of law and the foundations of our republic. Before pardoning his son, Biden had repeatedly pledged not to do so. He said in a statement explaining his reversal that the prosecution had been poisoned by politics. The decision prompted criminal justice advocates and lawmakers to put additional public pressure on the administration to use that same power for everyday Americans. It wasnt a very popular move; only about 2 in 10 Americans approved of his decision, according to a poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. Source: AP --Agencies",

        "title": "Trump named Times Person of the Year for second time",
        "date": "December 12, 2024 10:05 pm",
        "content": "Donald Trump once publicly speculated that Time would never name him the news magazines Person of the Year. Now, the honor has been bestowed on him twice. Time on Thursday named Trump as this years choice, recognizing the president-elect as the individual or group deemed to have wielded the greatest influence on global affairs for good or for ill. To celebrate the unveiling of the magazine cover, Trump will ring the opening bell at the New York Stock Exchange, a source familiar with the matter told CNN. Trump sat for a wide-ranging interview with the magazine last month. Time announced Trumps selection on X Thursday morning. Trumps selection mirrors his first recognition in 2016, when Time named him Person of the Year after his unexpected rise to the presidency. This time, the unveiling caps a remarkable comeback and a resurgence that has the potential to upend modern American politics. Despite the magazines dwindling circulation, Times Person of the Year remains an annual cultural touchstone and the distinction has become an obsession of sorts for Trump throughout the years. A Time cover naming him Person of the Year in 2009 hung in several of his golf clubs, The Washington Post reported nearly a decade later, though no such issue was ever printed. Through his widely followed Twitter account, Trump regularly weighed in on the annual selection and amplified accounts suggesting it should be him. He criticized the magazine in 2011 for picking The Protester in a nod to the revolutions breaking out across the Arab world and the Occupy movement in the US. A year later, he said Time had lost all credibility because it failed to list him among its 100 most influential people of the year. Trump has also privately complained about the choices, in particular when Taylor Swift won in 2023. Trump has often been fixated on the power the pop star wields and posted, I hate Taylor Swift, on social media earlier this year after she endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris. Over time, the title became a symbol of the mainstream fame and respect Trump sought out but appeared out of reach. In 2015, when the magazine named then-German Chancellor Angela Merkel its Person of the Year, he wrote on Twitter, I told you TIME Magazine would never pick me as person of the year despite being the big favorite, before adding: They picked person who is ruining Germany. Even after Time named Trump its person of the year in 2016  which he called a great honor on social media  he continued to closely monitor the results. The following year, Trump claimed he was in the mix for the distinction again but wouldnt agree to an interview and photo shoot. Time disputed his version of events. Despite his regular criticism of the media, Trump has regularly granted access to legacy outlets  including Time. He sat down for an extended interview in April of this year with the magazine at his Palm Beach club. Harris turned down a similar opportunity, the magazines owner said in October. Over the decades, the title has been granted to a wide array of figures, from heads of state and activists to entrepreneurs and, in some instances, brutal authoritarian leaders. Every US president since Franklin Delano Roosevelt, except Gerald Ford, has been named Person of the Year at least once. President Joe Biden and Harris were co-honorees after they defeated Trump in 2020. Members of Trumps family are expected to attend the Thursday event, including Ivanka Trump, according to a source familiar with planning. It marks a rare public appearance for the president-elects daughter, who served as a senior adviser during his first term. Source: CNN --Agencies",

        "title": "Bottom trawling by Indian fishermen must stop: Sri Lankas Fisheries Minister",
        "date": "December 13, 2024 09:59 am",
        "content": "The enduring fisheries conflict in the Palk Bay - which impacts fisher folk of northern Sri Lanka and daily wage fishermen of Tamil Nadu - can be decisively resolved only if the Indian side stops using the destructive bottomtrawling method, according to Sri Lankas Minister of Fisheries Ramalingam Chandrasekar. The fisheries conflict has remained a key diplomatic issue between India and Sri Lanka for many years. It is likely to be discussed during President Anura Kumara Dissanayakes scheduled visit to India next week. People from all ethnic groups and geographic regions, including the north, east, and hill coun-try, voted for us National Peoples Power alliance, giving us a big mandate in the recently held elections. We have a responsibility to address their concerns, said Mr. Chandrasekar, who represents the northern Jaffna district in par-liament. The longpersisting problem of bottom trawlers used by Indian fishermen, originating from Tamil Nadu, has been the chief concern of our northern fishing communities, he told The Hindu on Wednesday at the Ministry of Fisheries. Solving the IndoLanka fisheries conflict is part of the NPP governments comprehensive plans to enhance Sri Lankas fish production using modern technology and sustainable methods, he said. The countrys per capita fish consumption, which was 17.2 kg in 2017, has now declined to 11.07 kg, reflecting a reduction in peoples protein intake, according to the NPPs prepoll manifesto. Malnutrition has come under sharp focus, especially after the countrys painful economic crash in 2022. We need to enhance seafood production to ensure people have access to nutrition. To do all that, we need our sea and our marine biodiversity to be protected, Mr. Chandrasekar said. The fisheries conflict in the Palk Bay is largely over competing livelihoods amid a fastdepleting catch. While a bilaterally agreed, imaginary maritime boundary line demarcates territorial waters of the neighbours, northern Sri Lankan fishermen have for long pointed to bottom trawling as the underlying problem. Bottom trawlers are fishing vessels that typically drag large fishing nets along the seabed, scooping out everything from eggs and baby fish to marine vegetation, in addition to the target catch of fish or shrimps. For several decades, Indian fishermen from different coastal states, including Tamil Nadu, have used the practice that has boosted Indias seafood exports and yielded high profits. After discussing the issue in a 2016 bilateral meet-ing, India and Sri Lanka set up a Joint Working Group that, among other things, agreed to expedite the transition towards ending the practice of bottom trawling at the earliest. However, there has been no respite, according to Tamil fishermen living along Sri Lankas northern coast, who are among the worst affected in the islands protracted civil war that ended in 2009. Fifteen years since, they have been unable to rebuild their livelihoods, primarily because of the damaging effects of bottomtrawling by Indian fishermen. Sri Lanka banned the practice in 2017 and imposed stiff fines on foreign vessels in 2018. Despite the moves, and the ceaseless appeals from their northern Sri Lankan counterparts, Tamil Nadu fishermen are yet to give up the destructive prac-tice. On the other hand, daily wage Tamil Nadu fishermen engaged by the trawler owners are frequently arrested by the Sri Lankan Navy on charges of engaging in illegal fishing in Sri Lankas territorial waters, and the vessels are seized. The arrests so far in 2024 total over 530, more than double last years figure. Over 400 of those have been released and repatriated, official updates showed. On Wednesday, Indian High Commissioner San-tosh Jha called on the Minister at his office and stressed for a humanitarian  constructive approach in addressing the fishermen issue. Requested early release of fishermen in custody, the High Commission posted on X. Sri Lanka greatly valued Indias critical and timely assistance during the economic crisis of 2022, and President Dissanayakes government appreciates the importance of the countrys India ties, the Sri Lankan Minister noted. India is not only Sri Lankas close neighbour and important development partner, but a country that shares historic and cultural ties. Our grandparents and great grandparents hailed from India, said Mr. Chandrasekhar, who is from Sri Lankas Malaiyaha hill country Tamil community, brought down by the British two centuries ago to work in Sri Lankas plantations. Many of us still have familial links in Tamil Nadu, he said, urging the people and governments of India and Tamil Nadu to see the larger picture in the fisheries problem. There is a tendency to view the fisheries conflict as one between Tamil Nadu fishermen and the Sri Lankan Navy... but they must understand that bottom trawling has severely affected the livelihoods of Tamil fishermen in northern Sri Lanka, who have suffered huge losses during the war, he said.

        "title": "Former Sri Lankan diplomat in Australia fined more than 100,000 for entrapping domestic worker",
        "date": "December 13, 2024 10:27 am",
        "content": "A diplomat who entrapped a domestic worker in her Canberra home, forcing her to work 14 hours, seven days a week, for less than a dollar an hour, has been fined more than 100,000 in the Australian federal court. The fine is in addition to more than 500,000 in unpaid wages and interest she has already been ordered to restore, but has so far refused to pay. Himalee Arunatilaka served as Sri Lankas deputy high commissioner to Australia between 2015 and 2018. She employed Sri Lankan mother of two Priyanka Danaratna as a domestic worker in her home in Deakin, amid Canberras diplomatic quarter. Arunatilaka sponsored Danaratnas entry into Australia, promising she would pay her in accordance with Australian wages and conditions. But Danaratna told the federal court she was instead isolated and oppressed, working every day for three years, save for two days she spent in hospital after burning herself with oil in the kitchen. With breaks, it was calculated Danaratna worked 14 hours on a normal day, but when the deputy high commissioner was entertaining, she would not finish until 1am. Danaratna had her passport taken from her, and was not allowed to leave the house, except when given permission to take short walks in the neighbourhood. She did not provide me with satisfactory clothing and food. I did not feel like I was being treated properly, Danaratna told the court. Her lawyers calculated she was paid less than 65 cents an hour for her thousands of hours work over three years. In a judgment delivered Friday, Justice Elizabeth Raper said the diplomats offending was calculated and intentional. Ms Danaratna was deliberately isolated from the community and effectively entrapped within the household, the judge found. Ms Danaratna was deprived of any semblance of work and life divide. Her conditions bore no resemblance to what one would expect under Australian law and were egregious and exploitative. Raper said Aruntalika abused her authority and power over Danaratna. The whole scheme of exploitation stemmed from a number of factors. First, Ms Danaratna was vulnerable and wholly reliant on Ms Arunatilaka. She was unable to read or speak English and had no connections in the community. Secondly, by being cloistered in Ms Arunatilakas household Ms Danaratna was invisible from and unable to participate in Australian society. Thirdly, Ms Arunatilaka engaged in practices that entrapped Ms Danaratna in the household. The judge cited the seizure of Danaratnas passport, her being kept sequestered in the diplomats house and being refused access to all but the smallest sums of money, as consciously and acutely exploitative. Arunatilaka has refused to engage with the court process in Australia. She did not file any evidence with the court or appear at any hearings. Despite a judgment in August this year that she compensate Danaratna more than half a million dollars  543,300.73  in backpay and interest, she has not paid any of the money she owes. Arunatilaka has not responded to repeated requests for comment from Guardian Australia. Her diplomatic career has been unaffected. She is now serving as Sri Lankas permanent representative to the United Nations in Geneva, where she is also accredited to the International Labor Organisation. The Sri Lankan government has also rejected the courts judgments. In response to the courts first judgment, it accused Danaratna of absconding, and said it was satisfied that the said salary was paid to the domestic assistant by the employer as mutually agreed. But Justice Raper said Arunatilaka knowingly intentionally exploited her employee, signing documents committing to upholding Australian laws and to paying award wages. Despite this, she then signed a work contract with Danaratna which breached those obligations, and then failed to uphold even that contract. The judge said the protections of Australia laws were designed to protect vulnerable workers from the domestic servitude of the Victorian era. In fining Arunatilaka 117,028.80, Raper said the diplomat had taken no steps to rectify the conduct. She has not paid Ms Danaratna the amounts owing, has shown no remorse or contrition and has taken no steps to ensure that this does not happen again. And the judge said she was concerned a number of similar cases involving indentured servitude within the households of diplomats had come before the court. There is a particular need for penalties to be imposed which deter diplomat employers from exploiting foreign workers who they bring to Australia to work in their private, diplomatic residences  a strong, clear message needs to be sent to those involved in the diplomatic corps as to the consequences for engaging in like conduct and to deter contravening conduct of this kind.

Clarke Institute for Modern Technologies (ACCIMT) says that the Geminids meteor shower, considered as one of the most spectacular meteor showers of the year, will be visible tonight (13) and tomorrow (14). Accordingly, the Geminids meteor shower will peak and be clearly visible for Sri Lankans tomorrow night (14). Research scientist (astronomy) at ACCIMT Indika Medagangoda, explained that around 120 meteors per hour will be visible in the northern and eastern skies after 9.00 p.m. The Geminids, which are bright and have a yellow hue, are considered one of the best and most reliable annual meteor showers, when at least 120 meteors are usually seen per hour during its peak. The Geminid meteor shower peaks in the middle of December, with the most activity this year expected late Friday and into early Saturday, according to NASA. Unlike other meteors, which originate from comets, the Geminids are thought to come from an asteroid  3200 Phaethon  which is nearly 3 miles across and orbits the sun every 1.4 years.",

        "date": "December 13, 2024 01:04 pm",
        "content": "Indian conglomerate Adani Groups port project in Sri Lanka will go ahead despite US charges against its founder and sudden changes to its financing, the island nation said Friday. A bombshell indictment in New York last month accused billionaire tycoon Gautam Adani and several colleagues of deliberately misleading international investors as part of a bribery scheme. The charges sent Adani stocks into freefall and again raised questions over corporate governance at the family firm, whose founder is considered a close ally of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. But Sri Lankan ports minister Bimal Ratnayake said the allegations against Adani had no bearing on the deep-sea container terminal project in the capital Colombo. The problem between Adani and the US... is not our concern, he told reporters during a tour of the port on Thursday night. It is of high importance for us that western container terminal development by Adani goes ahead. Ratnayake said the project was necessary to generate revenue for the ailing Sri Lankan economy, still teetering after an unprecedented crisis and foreign debt default in 2022. The port project has an estimated cost of 700 million and is located next to a similar Chinese-run facility. Ratnayakes comments came days after Adani Group withdrew its request for a US government-backed loan of 553 million in the wake of the New York indictment. The loan agreement with the US International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) was finalised last year, with the project seen at the time as a means of countering Beijings rising influence in the Indian Ocean. Sri Lanka sits astride the worlds busiest shipping route, which links the Middle East and East Asia, giving its maritime assets strategic importance. Adani Group has said it will now finance the project from its own coffers. Sri Lanka opened an investigation into the conglomerates local projects, including the port and a 442 million wind power deal in the islands north, after last months indictment. New leftist President Anura Kumara Dissanayake campaigned against the wind project before his landslide election win in November, and Ratnayake said his government remained opposed to it. It would be disadvantageous to the country, Ratnayake added. Dissanayake had dubbed the project a threat to Sri Lankas energy sovereignty. Adani Group said it had lost almost 55 billion in a stock market rout since the indictment, in which US prosecutors accused its founder and other senior officials of bribing Indian government officials. With a business empire spanning coal, airports, cement and media, Adani Group has weathered previous corporate fraud allegations and suffered a similar stock rout last year. The conglomerate saw 150 billion wiped from its market value in 2023 after a report by short-seller Hindenburg Research accused it of brazen corporate fraud. Source: AFP --Agencies",

        "date": "December 13, 2024 05:18 pm",
        "content": "The Speaker of Sri Lankas Parliament Asoka Ranwala has resigned from his position, in the wake of the controversy surrounding his educational qualifications. The NPP Parliamentarian confirmed this decision issuing a special statement today (13). In his statement, the parliamentarian noted that an issue concerning his educational qualifications had surfaced over the past couple of days. Ranwala assured that he has never made a false statement regarding his educational qualifications at any point. However, the MP stated that at this moment he is not in possession of certain documents required to confirm his educational qualifications and that while he has requested for them from the relevant institutions, it is difficult to urgently produce these documents at this moment. MP Ranwala further stated that while the relevant documents can be obtained from the research institution affiliated with Japans Waseda University which had awarded him the doctorate, he intends to present them as soon as possible. However, considering the situation which has arisen, and in order to avoid inconveniencing the government and the people who had placed their trust in us, I have decided to resign from the position of Speaker of Parliament, he said. Various reports were circulated on social media over the doctorate of Ashoka Ranwala recently, and the controversy had escalated, with the Sri Lanka Parliament website recently removing the title Dr. from his profile in the members directory. Opposition parties had demanded a clarification on whether he genuinely holds a doctorate and have called on the government to clarify and dispel growing public suspicion surrounding the matter. The Speaker reportedly used the title Dr. in his introductions prior to contesting the general elections. Following his election as Speaker, his name was listed as Dr. Asoka Ranwala on the official website of the Parliament of Sri Lanka. However, the issue gained attention when university professors and other individuals questioned on social media whether the Speakers doctorate was legally granted or recognized. Adding to the speculation, doubts have been raised about the removal of the title Dr. from his name on the Parliaments website. In response, Mr. Ranwala had subsequently stated that he would address the allegations at the appropriate time. Meanwhile, the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) parliamentary group, led by Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa, today commenced signing the Motion of No Confidence against the Speaker of Parliament over the issue.",

        "title": "Macron names François Bayrou as French PM after government collapse",
        "date": "December 13, 2024 09:03 pm",
        "content": "French President Emmanuel Macron named key ally Francois Bayrou as his fourth prime minister of 2024 on Friday, but the scale of the challenge facing the veteran centrist was immediately clear as the Socialist Party refused to join his coalition government. Bayrou, 73, gave a sober assessment of whether he could tame a hung parliament that ousted his predecessor, Michel Barnier, just last week. It is a long road, everyone knows that, he told reporters. I am not the first to take a long road. Frances festering political malaise has raised doubts about whether Macron will complete his second presidential term until 2027. It has also lifted French borrowing costs and left a power vacuum in the heart of Europe, just as Donald Trump heads to the White House and Germany braces for new elections following the collapse of its governing coalition. Bayrou, the founder of the Democratic Movement (MoDem) party which has been a part of Macrons ruling alliance since 2017, has himself run for president three times, leaning on his rural roots as the longtime mayor of the southwestern town of Pau. His immediate priority will be passing a special law to roll over the 2024 budget, with a nastier battle over the belt-tightening 2025 legislation looming early next year. Parliamentary pushback over the 2025 bill led to Barniers downfall and left-wing leaders on Friday announced they might try to topple Bayrou as well should he use special constitutional powers to ram through the budget against parliament. Bayrous proximity to the deeply unpopular Macron may also prove to be a vulnerability. The Socialist Party, which Macron courted during his prime ministerial search, accused the president of ignoring their demands for a leftist leader in favour of a risky Macronista. We will thus not enter the government and remain in the opposition, said Boris Vallaud, the leader of the Socialists parliamentary bloc. View from the Left Reaction to Bayrous appointment on the left will be a concern for Macron, with the prime minister likely living day-to-day, at the mercy of the presidents opponents, for the foreseeable future. Macron will hope Bayrou can stave off no-confidence votes until at least July, when France will be able to hold a new parliamentary election. Far-left France Unbowed party leaders said they would be seeking to immediately remove Bayrou, while leaders from other left-wing parties took a more nuanced approach. Greens boss Marine Tondelier also said she would support a no-confidence motion if the prime minister ignored their tax and pensions concerns. Communist leader Fabien Roussel said his party would hold fire against Bayrou and decide on a case-by-case basis if he promises not to ram through legislation. Jordan Bardella, president of the far-right National Rally (RN) party, said it would not be calling for an immediate no-confidence motion, while fellow RN leader Marine Le Pen said Bayrou should listen to the oppositions budgetary wishes. Real Test Over 2025 Budget Looms Barniers budget bill, which aimed for 60 billion euros (63 billion) in savings to assuage investors increasingly concerned by Frances 6 deficit, was deemed too miserly by the far-right and left. The governments failure to find a way out of the gridlock has seen French borrowing costs push higher. XTB Research Director Kathleen Brooks said Bayrous appointment was unlikely to have a major impact on French bonds. However, she said the CAC 40 French stock index is underperforming German stocks by a three-decade margin. With France still mired in political turmoil, narrowing this gap is an uphill struggle, even with a new PM, she wrote. Macron named Bayrou as justice minister in 2017 but he resigned only weeks later amid an investigation into his partys alleged fraudulent employment of parliamentary assistants. He was acquitted of fraud charges this year. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "date": "December 13, 2024 09:36 pm",
        "content": "Sri Lanka gained extensive support from private creditors to restructure its international bonds, a key step for the country to exit an extended default. The Government of Sri Lanka has announced indicative results of its recent consent solicitation and invitation to exchange concerning the countrys existing bonds. The initiative, which launched on November 25, 2024, has seen significant bondholder participation ahead of the December 12, 2024, expiration deadline. According to the indicative results, instructions from holders representing 96 of the principal amount outstanding of the existing bonds have been received. This includes a series of bonds with varying maturities, ranging from those due in April 2023 to those maturing in March 2030. The exchange invites eligible holders of the aggregated collective action clauses (CAC) existing bonds and non-aggregated CAC existing bonds to swap their current holdings for new securities or substitute consideration. The invitation also extends to holders of 2022 bonds, which showed a lower participation rate of 73. For the aggregated CAC existing bonds, participation rates were high, with the 1.25 billion 5.750 bonds due April 18, 2023, receiving 98 participation, and the 1.5 billion 7.550 bonds due March 28, 2030, garnering 99 participation. The non-aggregated CAC existing bonds also saw strong support, with the 1.5 billion 6.850 bonds due November 3, 2025, achieving 98 participation. The Republic expects to announce the final results of the invitation on December 16, 2024, including whether the settlement conditions have been satisfied or waived. The consent solicitations and invitations to exchange are part of Sri Lankas efforts to restructure its debt amidst economic challenges. The success of the initiative is indicative of the bondholders willingness to support the countrys economic recovery. Investors representing 96 of the countrys 12.6 billion in dollar bonds agreed to swap their securities for new notes, the government said, citing indicative results of its consent solicitation for the exchange. Once confirmed with official results on Dec. 16, the widespread support would mean that the debt restructuring should be completed before year-end. The agreement after the South Asian economy defaulted in April 2022 marks a resolution of the debt revamp following several rounds of negotiations after which the parties agreed to a 27 haircut on the nominal amount of existing bonds. The agreement pushes back due dates for the bonds and reduces interest rates, while introducing so-called macro-linked bonds for the first time in a debt rework. After a one-time single test, four notes maturing between 2030 and 2038 could generate lower or higher payments for investors depending on the countrys economic performance. The deal also includes a governance-linked note, from which the country could get a 75 basis-point coupon reduction on more than 1.5 billion of debt if it meets certain governance targets, including increasing revenue collection. Holders of at least two-thirds of the outstanding debt had to agree on a deal for it to be binding for all creditors, with a minimum 50 threshold for each note. For three bonds, the voting threshold was set even higher, at 75. The debt rework with private creditors was a necessary step under a 3 billion loan the country secured from the International Monetary Fund. Sri Lanka also restructured its debt with bilateral creditors such as China, India and Japan as part of its IMF program, but the details of those agreements werent made public. The debt rework with private creditors took so long that it was mainly negotiated with the previous government, then finalized under the current presidency of Anura Kumara Dissanayake after he was elected on Sept. 21. --With Agencies Inputs Sri Lanka Announces the Successful Expiration of its Consent Solicitation and Exchange Offer Related to its... by Adaderana Online on Scribd",

        "content": "Sri Lanka has successfully concluded its international bond restructuring, bringing closure to one of the most complex and challenging sovereign debt restructuring exercises in recent history, says Treasury Secretary Mahinda Siriwardana. In a post on X (formerly Twitter), he expressed gratitude to all stakeholders who supported them in this journey, including Sri Lankas government and political leadership since he took office in April 2022 to date, Sri Lankas international and domestic creditors, who he says continuously worked with them in good faith. He also thanked the Sri Lankan governments advisors Lazard and Clifford Chance, along with Citi, Sodali  Co, and all those who worked with them in making the debt exchange a success, as well as officials at the Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL), who he said worked tirelessly over the last 32 months towards bringing Sri Lanka out of this deep crisis. Siriwardana, who is also Secretary to the Finance Ministry, said the debt restructuring process provides Sri Lanka with substantial debt relief which we must use diligently to re-build our fiscal and external buffers and set the foundation for economic recovery and growth. As we close this chapter, Sri Lanka now has the opportunity for a fresh beginning, where we must not repeat mistakes of the past, and instead embark on a journey of sustainable, inclusive, productivity driven economic growth that enriches the lives and well- being of all Sri Lankans, he said.

        "date": "December 14, 2024 11:10 am",
        "content": "A defiant South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol faces a second impeachment vote on Saturday over his short-lived attempt to impose martial law, a move that shocked the country, split his party and imperilled his presidency half way through his term. Yoon rescinded his Dec. 3 move to impose military rule barely six hours later, after the opposition-controlled parliament defied troops and police to vote against the decree. But it plunged the country into a constitutional crisis and triggered widespread calls for him to step down on the grounds that he had broken the law. Opposition parties plan to hold an impeachment vote at 4 p.m. (0700 GMT), with large demonstrations planned ahead of the vote. Yoons conservative People Power Party boycotted the first impeachment vote a week earlier, preventing a quorum. Since then, PPP leader Han Dong-hoon has urged party members to vote for impeachment this time, and at least seven PPP members have said they would vote to impeach. The opposition parties need at least eight PPP votes to impeach Yoon, as they control 192 of the 300 seats in the single-chamber parliament and impeachment requires a two-thirds majority. Ahn Cheol-soo, a PPP lawmaker backing Yoons impeachment, said in a Facebook post on Saturday that he would vote for impeachment for the sake of swift stabilization of peoples livelihood, economy and diplomacy. The PPP floor leader said on Friday, however, that the partys stance remained to oppose impeachment. PPP lawmakers were meeting Saturday morning to decide whether to change that position. The main opposition Democratic Party said on Saturday Yoons madness could no longer be tolerated. Refusing impeachment is treason against the people, the party said in a statement, asking more from the ruling party to join the impeachment. If impeached, Yoon would lose authority but remain in office until the Constitutional Court either removes or reinstates him. In the meantime, Prime Minister Han Duck-soo would serve as acting president. If the court removes Yoon or he resigns, a presidential election must be held within 60 days. Yoon is separately under criminal investigation for alleged insurrection over the martial law declaration and authorities have banned him from travelling overseas. He has not signalled a willingness to resign and in a speech on Thursday vowed he would fight to the end, defending his martial law decree as necessary to overcome political deadlock and protect the country from domestic politicians who he said were undermining democracy. Yoon, president of Asias fourth-largest economy, hopes political allies will rally to support him, but the fiery remarks appeared to find mixed reception among PPP lawmakers. A Gallup Korea poll on Friday found two-thirds of supporters of Yoons party opposing the impeachment, though three-quarters of all respondents supported it. Protesters calling for Yoons impeachment began gathering near the parliament on Saturday, while pro-Yoon right-wing rallies at the centre of Seoul were due to start early in the afternoon. Some K-pop celebrities have slammed the president and plan to donate food and drinks for those participating in the rally to demand Yoons impeachment. People have been using delivery apps to pre-order food and coffee for protesters. Elected in 2022, Yoon was widely welcomed in Washington and other Western capitals for his rhetoric defending global democracy and freedom, but critics said that masked growing problems at home. He clashed with opposition lawmakers whom he has labelled as anti-state forces, and press freedom organisations have criticised his heavy-handed approach to media coverage that he deems negative. The crisis and ensuing uncertainty have shaken financial markets and threatened to undermine South Koreas reputation as a stable, democratic success story. South Korean shares rose for a fourth straight session on Friday on hopes that the political uncertainty would ease after this weekends parliamentary impeachment vote. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

Issuing a statement, the SLBFE emphasized that, a notable increase has been observed in the proportion of male migrant workers, which now stands at 60 (177,804 males), while 40 of the total workforce sent abroad were women (122,358). Of those going abroad, 184,140 went through self-basic, while 116,022 went through employment agencies. Kuwait remained the top destination, with 73,995 Sri Lankans finding employment there, followed by 49,499 workers going to the UAE. There is a growing trend of Sri Lankans seeking employment in countries such as South Korea (7,002), Israel (9,211), Romania (10,274), and Japan (8,251), the statement added. The SLBFE projects that by the end of 2024, the number of Sri Lankans migrant workers going abroad for work will likely exceed 311,000. Additionally, remittances from migrant workers have contributed significantly to the economy, with Sri Lanka receiving USD 5,961.6 million up to November 2024.",

However, this excludes the direct payments made to athletes benefiting from Olympic scholarships, the National Olympic Committee has been informed via email. Accordingly, a special General Meeting of the National Olympic Committee was held yesterday (December 13) in response to this decision, during which it was decided that the election of the National Olympic Committee should be held promptly. The current term of office of the committee is scheduled to end in April 2026. However, the proposal to hold an early election was passed by a two-thirds majority vote at yesterdays meeting. The next election of the National Olympic Committee has reportedly been planned to be held before March of next year after obtaining the recommendations of the IOC. Accordingly, the IOC and the OCA have suspended providing funds to Sri Lankas National Olympic Committee effective from December 10, 2024. This had been officially conveyed to the NOCSL via a joint letter dated December 10, sent by IOC Director of NOC Relations, Olympic Solidarity, James Macleod and the Director General of the Olympic Council of Asia (OCA), Husain Al-Musallam. This move is seen as an attempt to pressure the NOCSL into taking necessary action regarding their ethics committee report. The ethics committee report suggests the immediate suspension of the incumbent Secretary General of NOCSL, Maxwell de Silva, pending further investigations by law enforcement and other statutory authorities regarding several allegations of ethics violations and misuse of funds.",

        "date": "December 14, 2024 01:46 pm",
        "content": "The Presidential Secretary, Dr. Nandika Sanath Kumanayake has officially informed the Secretary General of Parliament in writing that the President has accepted the resignation of Speaker Ashoka Ranwala. The Secretary to the President has informed the Secretary General of Parliament, Mrs. Kushani Rohanadeera, in writing that the President has accepted the resignation of the Speaker, Asoka Ranwala. The newly elected Speaker of the Tenth Parliament, Asoka Ranwala, had informed the President in writing that he would resign from his post. In terms of Article 64(2) of the Constitution, if a Member holding office as the Speaker, Deputy Speaker or Deputy Chairman of a Committee resigns his office, he shall notify the President in writing. Accordingly, the Secretary to the President has given this written communication to the Secretary General of Parliament. Ranwala announced his resignation from his position as Speaker of Parliament on December 13, amidst the controversy surrounding his educational qualifications. This is the first time in Sri Lankas parliamentary history that a Speaker has resigned. Political observers have indicated that the appointment of a new Speaker will likely take place on December 17, when the Parliament reconvenes. Nominees for the position are expected to be submitted on the same day. The Speaker can submit his resignation to the General Secretary of Parliament or the President. Once the President receives the resignation letter, he can decide whether to accept it. Upon acceptance, Parliament must elect a new Speaker, either through a vote or nomination, as per the regulations. Meanwhile, announcing his resignation in a statement yesterday (13), Ranwala addressed the controversy regarding his educational qualifications, which surfaced in the days leading up to his resignation. He clarified that he had never made a false statement about his academic background. However, the MP stated that at this moment he is not in possession of certain documents required to confirm his educational qualifications and that while he has requested for them from the relevant institutions, it is difficult to urgently produce these documents at this moment. MP Ranwala further stated that while the relevant documents can be obtained from the research institution affiliated with Japans Waseda University which had awarded him the doctorate, he intends to present them as soon as possible. The controversy surrounding his doctorate escalated when reports circulated on social media, leading to the removal of the title Dr. from his profile on the Sri Lanka Parliament website. Opposition parties had raised concerns, demanding clarification on whether his doctorate was legitimately granted and recognized. In response, Ranwala assured that he would address these allegations at the appropriate time. Meanwhile, the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB), led by Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa, initiated signing a Motion of No Confidence against the Speaker over the issue on December 13.",

        "date": "December 14, 2024 02:02 pm",
        "content": "South Koreas parliament voted Saturday to impeach President Yoon Suk Yeol as authorities investigate allegations of rebellion over his controversial Dec. 3 martial law decree that has caused huge political turmoil in the country. The National Assembly passed the motion 204-85 in a floor vote. Yoons presidential powers and duties will be suspended after the copies of a document on the impeachment are delivered to him and to the Constitutional Court. The court has up to 180 days to determine whether to dismiss Yoon as president or restore his powers. If hes thrown out of office, a national election to choose his successor must be held within 60 days. It was the second National Assembly vote on Yoons impeachment motion. Last Saturday, Yoon survived an impeachment vote after most ruling party lawmakers boycotted the floor vote. Some People Power Party lawmakers had since announced their intentions to vote for Yoons impeachment in a second vote, as public protests against Yoon intensified and his approval rating plummeted. Tens of thousands of people have braved the bitter cold and poured onto the streets of the capital, Seoul, every night for the past two weeks, calling for Yoons ouster and arrest. They shouted slogans, sang, danced and waved K-pop light sticks. Smaller groups of Yoons conservative supporters  still in the thousands  have also been rallying in Seoul, denouncing attempts to impeach the president. Both rallies have largely been peaceful. Yoons martial law imposition, the first of its kind in more than four decades in South Korea, lasted only six hours, but has caused massive political tumult, halted diplomatic activities and rattled financial markets. Yoon was forced to lift his decree after parliament unanimously voted to overturn it. After declaring martial law, Yoon sent hundreds of troops and police officers to the parliament to try to impede its vote on the decree before they withdrew after the parliament rejected it. No major violence occurred. Opposition parties and many experts accuse Yoon of rebellion, citing a law clause that categorizes as rebellion the staging of a riot against established state authorities to undermine the constitution. They also say that by law a president in South Korea is allowed to declare martial law only during wartime or similar emergencies and has no rights to suspend parliaments operations even under martial law. The impeachment motion alleged that Yoon committed rebellion that hurts peace on the Republic of Korea by staging a series of riots. It said Yoons mobilization of military and police forces threatened the National Assembly and the public and that his martial law decree was aimed at disturbing the Constitution. In a fiery speech on Thursday, Yoon rejected the rebellion charges, calling his martial law order an act of governance. The conservative Yoon said he aimed to issue a warning to the main liberal opposition Democratic Party, calling it a monster and anti-state forces that he argued has flexed its legislative muscle to impeach top officials and undermined the governments budget bill for next year. I will fight to the end to prevent the forces and criminal groups that have been responsible for paralyzing the countrys government and disrupting the nations constitutional order from threatening the future of the Republic of Korea, Yoon said. Democratic Party leader Lee Jae-myung called Yoons speech a mad declaration of war against his own people. The Democratic Party and five other opposition parties control the 300-member unicameral parliament with a combined 192 seats, but they were eight seats shy of the two-thirds majority needed to pass Yoons impeachment motion and needed support from ruling party lawmakers. Yoon has been banned from leaving South Korea, as law enforcement authorities are investigating whether he and others involved in the martial law declaration committed rebellion, abuse of power and other crimes. If convicted, the leader of a rebellion plot can face the death penalty or life imprisonment. Yoon has the presidential privilege of immunity from criminal prosecution but that doesnt extend to allegations of rebellion or treason. Subsequently, Yoon could be investigated, detained, arrested or indicted over his martial law decree, but many observers doubt that authorities will forcefully detain him because of the potential for clashes with his presidential security service. Yoons defense minister, police chief and the head of Seouls metropolitan police agency have been arrested over their roles in the martial law case. Other senior military and government officials also face investigations. Source: AP --Agencies",

        "content": "The Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption (CIABOC) has launched an investigation into the nearly 6,000 vehicles across Sri Lanka which have been fraudulently registered with the Department of Motor Traffic (DMT). The commission has stated that legal action is currently being taken regarding the identified vehicles which were allegedly imported illegally without paying the necessary customs duties owed to the government. The vehicles in question have been seized by the commission for investigation and handed over to Sri Lanka Customs for further inquiries, as well as to uncover unpaid customs duties and other applicable fees. It has been observed that the transferees of these vehicles have encountered significant inconvenience and challenges, particularly when transferring to the second or subsequent owners. As a remedy, the commission has issued guidelines to Sri Lanka Customs to develop an online portal to allow prospective vehicle buyers to verify whether proper import duties and other fees have been paid before purchasing a vehicle. In response, Sri Lanka Customs has introduced an online portal through which individuals can check if the vehicle they wish to purchase has been legally imported into Sri Lanka and whether the relevant customs duties have been paid. Accordingly, the CIABOC says the public has been provided with the opportunity to verify the legal import status of vehicles they own or plan to purchase through the following online portal: https:services.customs.gov.lkvehicles",

An electoral college, controlled by the ruling Georgian Dream party and boycotted by the opposition, elected Mikheil Kavelashvili with 224 votes as the countrys next figurehead leader for a five-year term, central election commission chair Giorgi Kalandarishvili said. The sitting president Salome Zurabishvili has declared the vote illegitimate and refused to step down. Protests The Black Sea nation has been in turmoil since the governing Georgian Dream party claimed victory in contested October parliamentary elections. Its decision last month to delay European Union membership talks ignited a fresh wave of mass rallies. The opposition has denounced Saturdays election as illegitimate and said sitting President Salome Zurabishvili remains the countrys sole legitimate leader. Pro-Western Zurabishvili, who is at loggerheads with Georgian Dream, has refused to step down and is demanding new parliamentary elections, paving the way for a constitutional showdown. On Saturday morning, protesters began gathering outside the parliament building, which was cordoned off by police forces. Georgia never loses its sense of humour, celebrating the election of a footballer as president, Zurabishvili wrote on social media.

A huge rescue operation involving vessels and aircraft was under way in the sea near the island of Gavdos, south of Crete, after the boat capsized shortly after midnight, the coastguard said. The first dead was found Saturday morning. According to the Athens News Agency, a migrant is being treated in the intensive care unit of the Chania hospital in the ICU in a serious condition while three people are also hospitalised with cardiac problems and hypothermia. Saturday afternoon, the coastguard told AFP that the number of migrants found dead had risen to five.

        "content": "ABC News has agreed to pay 15m (12m) to US President-elect Donald Trump to settle a defamation lawsuit after its star anchor falsely said he had been found liable for rape. George Stephanopoulos made the statements repeatedly during an interview on 10 March this year while challenging a congresswoman about her support for Trump. A jury in a civil case last year determined Trump was liable for sexual abuse, which has a specific definition under New York law. As part of Saturdays settlement, first reported by Fox News Digital, ABC will also publish a statement expressing its regret for the statements by Stephanopoulos. According to the settlement, ABC News will pay 15m as a charitable contribution to a Presidential foundation and museum to be established by or for Plaintiff, as Presidents of the United States of America have established in the past. The network also agreed to pay 1m towards Trumps legal fees. Under the settlement, the network will post an editors note to the bottom of its 10 March 2024 online news article about the story. It will say: ABC News and George Stephanopoulos regret statements regarding President Donald J Trump made during an interview by George Stephanopoulos with Rep. Nancy Mace on ABCs This Week on March 10, 2024. An ABC News spokesperson said in a statement the company was pleased that the parties have reached an agreement to dismiss the lawsuit on the terms in the court filing. In 2023, a New York civil court found Trump sexually abused E Jean Carroll in a dressing room at a department store in 1996. He was also found guilty of defaming the magazine columnist. Judge Lewis Kaplan said the jurys conclusion was that Ms Carroll had failed to prove that Trump raped her within the narrow, technical meaning of a particular section of the New York Penal Law. Judge Kaplan noted that the definition of rape was far narrower than how rape is defined in common modern parlance, in some dictionaries and in criminal statutes elsewhere. In a separate case, also presided over by the same judge, a jury ordered Trump to pay 83.3m to Ms Carroll for additional defamatory statements. During the 10 March broadcast, Stephanopoulos asked South Carolina Republican congresswoman Nancy Mace how she could endorse Trump. The anchor falsely said judges and two separate juries have found him liable for rape. Stephanopoulos repeated the claim 10 times throughout the broadcast. Ahead of the ruling, a federal magistrate judge had ordered Trump and Stephanopoulos to give sworn evidence at depositions next week. Trump has also sued CBS, the BBCs US broadcast partner, for deceptive conduct over an interview with Kamala Harris. In 2023, a judge threw out his defamation lawsuit against CNN, in which he alleged the network had likened him to Adolf Hitler. He has also had lawsuits filed against the New York Times and the Washington Post dismissed. Source: BBC --Agencies",

        "date": "December 15, 2024 01:03 pm",
        "content": "The Department of Inland Revenue (IRD) has issued a notice to taxpayers, urging them to meet key deadlines for tax payments this December to avoid penalties and legal action. Taxpayers are reminded that the Value Added Tax (VAT) and Social Security Contribution Levy for the month of November 2024 must be paid on or before 20 December 2024. For those who have missed paying taxes due on their income tax returns for the assessment year 20232024, the deadline to settle these payments is 26 December 2024. Additionally, any unpaid self-assessment tax, arrears tax, or agreed additional assessment tax must also be paid by this date, the Commissioner General of the IRD noted. The department has cautioned that failure to meet this deadline will result in taxpayers losing the opportunity to seek relief from penalties for these unpaid amounts. The Commissioner General further stated that field surveys are already underway, and legal action has been initiated under the Inland Revenue Acts to recover outstanding self-assessment and arrears taxes. Taxpayers are strongly advised to ensure their compliance and avoid unnecessary complications by settling their dues promptly. For assistance or further information, individuals are encouraged to reach out to the Inland Revenue Department.",
