        "title": "Surge in remittances from Sri Lankans overseas  Acting Finance Minister",
        "date": "September 21, 2023 07:35 pm",
        "content": "Acting Finance Minister Ranjith Siyambalapitiya announced that over the past year, inflation in Sri Lanka has significantly decreased to 62.1, thanks to President Ranil Wickremesinghes robust economic reform agenda. Siyambalapitiya also highlighted that inflation, which stood by 66.7 during the first and second quarters of 2022, has now plummeted to just 4.6 for the same period in 2023, the Presidents Media Division (PMD) reported. He made this announcement during a press conference held today (21) at the Presidential Media Center, focusing on the theme of Collective Path to a Stable Country. Acting Finance Minister Siyambalapitiya further said; Over the past year, the government successfully increased the countrys foreign reserves from 1.8 billion dollars to 3.8 billion dollars. In August 2022, the exchange rate stood at Rs. 361 per dollar, but by August 2023, one dollar could be acquired for Rs. 321. This shift is not the result of artificial control but rather a reflection of the rupees value adjusting in response to supply and demand for the dollar, which holds significant economic importance. The interest rate for deposits, previously at 14 in 2022, has been lowered to 11, while the loan interest rate, previously at 15.5, has been reduced to 12 this year. Notably, last year, the primary account deficit was Rs. -247 billion, but this year it has turned into a surplus of Rs. 27 billion. This marks the first surplus in the primary account balance in over 40 years. Tourist arrivals, which numbered 496,430 in 2022, have surged to 904,318 during the first two quarters of this year. Equally impressive is the growth in tourism earnings, which rose from 832.6 million US dollars in 2022 to 1,304.5 million US dollars in the first two quarters of this year, reflecting a remarkable 56.7 increase compared to the previous year. In the past year, the amount of money remitted by Sri Lankans living abroad to Sri Lanka has surged from 2,214.8 million US dollars to 3,862.7 million US dollars this year, marking a remarkable 74.4 increase according to data from the Ministry of Finance. On August 1, 2022, the QR code system was introduced as a measure to manage petroleum demand due to foreign exchange shortages. This led to a significant disparity between normal demand and supply, resulting in a notable increase in diesel consumption by 28 and petrol consumption by 83 in June 2023, when the QR system was partially relaxed. However, as of September 1, the QR code system, which directly impacts economic growth, has been completely lifted. Upon assuming office, President Ranil Wickremesinghe faced a daunting challenge of addressing a 14-hour power outage, which had a direct impact on the economy. Presently, the government ensures a continuous and stable electricity supply to the population. As of August 23, 2023, there were 1467 imported goods banned due to foreign exchange shortages. Currently, the ban applies to only 279 items. Furthermore, the import of vehicles, which had been halted in 2020, now includes buses and trucks for public transport. In April 2022, the country faced difficulties in meeting its debt obligations. However, the government has since secured the first installment under the International Monetary Funds Extended Credit Scheme, contributing to stabilizing the countrys economy compared to the previous year.",

        "date": "September 21, 2023 09:19 pm",
        "content": "The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) handed over a substantial consignment of 4,700 Metric Tonnes of soya beans and maize to Sri Lanka Thriposha Limited, to support the continuation of the Thriposha fortified food programme. The United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) facilitated the handover at a special event held at the Thriposha factory. This consignment forms part of a wider contribution of USD20 million from the United States towards WFPs emergency operation to support Sri Lankan communities impacted by the countrys economic crisis. As a significant contributor locally and globally, the US has enabled WFP to provide cash, food assistance and value vouchers to food-insecure Sri Lankan families, while supporting national food and nutrition programmes, including school meals and Thriposha- a fortified blended food product, the WFP said in a statement. The U.S. Agency for International Development is pleased to deepen our long partnership with Sri Lanka through our recent emergency funding to provide essential ingredients for the Thriposha blended food supplement to prevent malnutrition of Sri Lankan children, states Asta Zinbo, Director of the Office of Governance and Vulnerable Populations, USAID. Responding to last years crisis, we witnessed the delivery of the last shipment of maize and soya beans to the Thriposha factory, in close collaboration with our partners the World Food Programme, the Ministry of Health and the Sri Lankan government. USAID supported Thriposha at the beginning in 1973, and its wonderful to see our joint efforts continue to safeguard the futures of countless children and mothers in Sri Lanka today. The countrys economic crisis, with lost jobs, reduced incomes, and soaring costs of living, hasaffected peoples ability to access healthy meals. Vulnerable groups, including pregnant and breastfeeding women and young children, are at elevated risk of malnutrition, the statement added. Of all of the groups affected by the countrys economic crisis, it is the children and women we are worried about the most, says Gerard Rebello, Deputy Country Director of WFP, Sri Lanka. We are grateful for the generosity and support from the United States in assisting these vulnerable groups, so they receive critical nutrition at a time when they need it the most. WFPs support to the Thriposha programme is an integral part of our emergency operation to safeguard development progress and mitigate the long-term effects of the economic crisis. Thriposha is used to supplement a regular diet with essential nutrition and is provided free of charge through the national nutritional programme. The US-funded raw materials will be used to provide four rounds of Thriposha for over half a million pregnant and breastfeeding women, and undernourished children under five, it added. WFP, with funding from donors like the US, has reached over 3.8 million people with food and nutrition assistance since June 2022 through its emergency operation, including those who received support through multiple activities, according to the WFP.",

        "content": "Sri Lankas Transport and Highways Ministry has signed today a contract with Indias IRCON International Limited for the design, installation, testing, and commissioning of a Signalling system along the Sri Lanka Railways Maho to Anuradhapura route, spanning 66 kilometers. The contract, valued at USD 14.90 million, was inked in the presence of Sri Lankas Minister of Transport and Highways, Dr. Bandula Gunawardane, and Indias High Commissioner in Sri Lanka, Gopal Baglay. The project which will be executed under an Indian Line of Credit of USD 318 million, is set to bolster transportation links and foster economic growth. High Commissioner Mr. Baglay emphasized the significance of this initiative for Sri Lanka, reflecting Indias commitment to supporting its neighbour. He highlighted that the credit line for this project in the current situation, symbolizes the continued desire of the Government and the people of India to stand with the people of Sri Lanka. Sri Lankas Transport and Mass Media Minister Dr. Gunawardane expressed gratitude to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the Indian government for their support, particularly during Sri Lankas recent economic challenges. It was also pointed out that Sri Lankan railway projects have received support in the form of LOCs in recent times only from India. Projects of over USD 1 billion in the Railway sector have been completed under 5 Indian LOCs to date. IRCON, which started its operations in Sri Lanka in March 2009, has completed several projects in Sri Lanka with Indian assistance and has contributed significantly towards rehabilitation and modernization of Sri Lanka Railways, capacity building, and employment generation. IRCON is currently involved in a USD 91.27 million project to upgrade and rehabilitate the railway line from Maho to Omanthai, covering a distance of 128 kilometers. The track rehabilitation from Anuradhapura to Omanthai is already finished, while work on the Anuradhapura to Maho section is scheduled to begin in January 2024. --Agencies",

        "title": "Russia temporarily bans fuel exports to most countries in response to shortages",
        "date": "September 21, 2023 10:17 pm",
        "content": "Russia has temporarily banned exports of gasoline and diesel to all countries outside a circle of four ex-Soviet states with immediate effect in order to stabilise the domestic market, the government said on Thursday. It said the ban did not apply to fuel supplied under inter-governmental agreements to members of the Moscow-led Eurasian Economic Union, which includes Belarus, Kazakhstan, Armenia and Kyrgyzstan. Temporary restrictions will help saturate the fuel market, which in turn will reduce prices for consumers, the government said in a statement. The energy ministry said the measure would prevent unauthorised grey exports of motor fuels. In recent months Russia has suffered shortages of gasoline and diesel. Wholesale fuel prices have spiked, although retail prices are capped to try to curb them in line with official inflation. The crunch has been especially painful in some parts of Russias southern breadbasket, where fuel is crucial for gathering the harvest. A serious crisis could be awkward for the Kremlin as a presidential election looms in March. Traders say the fuel market has been hit by factors including maintenance at oil refineries, bottlenecks on railways and the weakness of the rouble, which incentivises fuel exports. Russia has already cut its seaborne diesel and gasoil exports by nearly 30 to about 1.7 million metric tons in the first 20 days of September compared to the same period in August, according to traders and LSEG data. The government statement added: Previously, to stabilise the situation on the fuel market, the government raised the mandatory supply volumes of motor gasoline and diesel fuel to the commodity exchange Daily monitoring of fuel purchases for the needs of agricultural producers with prompt adjustment of volumes has also been set up. Russia exported 4.817 million tons of gasoline and almost 35 million tons of diesel last year. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "date": "September 21, 2023 10:53 pm",
        "content": "Addressing the UN General Assembly in New York on Thursday, President Ranil Wickremesinghe pledged to lead Sri Lanka towards sustainable growth, ensuring peace and prosperity for all, with the support of both the nation and the international community. He stated this while delivering his address during the General Debate of the 78th Session of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA). President Ranil Wickremesinghe told the UNGA that currently, there is a stark contrast with the 2030 promise, as poverty and hunger levels are at multi-decade highs. Neutral nations like Sri Lanka in the global South find themselves caught between shifting global power dynamics, he further said. Wickremesinghe said that crises like climate change and pandemics are hampering smaller indebted countries like Sri Lanka from advancing Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and climate efforts. Global power conflicts are adding economic uncertainty, disrupting supply chains and causing inflation, food, and energy insecurity worldwide, he said. The President said Sri Lanka is grappling with an unprecedented economic crisis. To put it in perspective, the cost of World War II in todays USD would be 4 trillion and the Marshall Plan 150 billion, he said. Restructuring the global fiscal system is crucial, as failure in this endeavour could jeopardize efforts to combat climate change and attain the SDGs, the Sri Lankan President emphasized. President Wickremesinghe further said that adverse climate impacts affect clean energy, food security, water, and farmers livelihoods in Sri Lanka, straining their fiscal recovery from last years economic crisis. As a climate-vulnerable, debt-ridden nation, the need for climate finance is urgent, he said, adding that despite promises, wealthy countries are falling short on their commitments. He also said the composition of the UN Security Council must be expanded to be representative of current global diversity and decision-making. He said in parallel, the role of the UNGA must be strengthened and requested that the permanent members engage in a credible dialogue which will lead to a unified approach to combat these threats ahead of the next sessions. The President urged the UN member states to find new ways of working together despite the increasing mistrust that has permeated international relations. This, he said, can be achieved through the willingness of the permanent members to work together in solidarity with the developing world.",

Joining a media conference in Colombo, the police spokesperson mentioned that majority of them were found to be revenge attacks executed by organized criminal gang members. Meanwhile, DIG in charge of Western Province Deshabandu Tennakoon has said the support of good citizens is imperative to crack down on the crimes taking place in the country. Addressing an event at a school in Panadura, DIG Tennakoon underscored that it is the responsibility of the police to eliminate the fear of crime, and attributed the main reason for the crimes to drug abuse. He said most often than not people tend to commit thefts, robberies and murders as a result of the cognitive distortion caused by drug addiction. These remarks came after four people who were travelling in a three-wheeler were targeted in a drive-by shooting that took place in Thalduwa, Avissawella on Wednesday night (Sept. 20). Two of them died while the other two sustained critical injuries. It was reported that the two assailants who arrived on a motorcycle had fired nearly 25 shots at the victims using a T-56 firearm.

        "date": "September 22, 2023 11:37 am",
        "content": "Sri Lankas Ministry of Health has placed orders to import testing kits to detect Nipah infections after the southern Indian state of Kerala reported an outbreak of the bat-borne virus. However, the ministry said Sri Lankans should not have any undue fears about this virus infection, adding that the ordered test kits are expected to reach the country in the coming days. Following the outbreak in Kerala, the Indian government has moved to institute mass testing to arrest the spread of the Nipah virus. The southern Indian state has thus far reported two deaths from the virus infections. Nipah is a rare but potentially serious virus that can cause fever, vomiting and respiratory infections in humans. Symptoms appear from 4 - 14 days after exposure. Fruit bats of the Pteropodidae family are the natural hosts of Nipah virus. Most often, severe cases involve seizures and encephalitis (inflammation of the brain) and can progress to a coma within 24-48 hours, according to experts. World Health Organization (WHO) says the fatality rate is estimated at 40 - 75. However, this rate can vary by outbreak depending on local capabilities for epidemiological surveillance and clinical management. At present, there are no approved vaccines or drugs to treat Nipah infections despite the WHO identifying the virus as a priority disease for WHO Research and Development Blueprint. The usual treatment is to provide intensive supportive care. Nipah virus can infect humans through contact with the bodily fluids from infected bats and pigs, or through contaminated food items. The WHO says the virus can also be transmitted directly from human to human. Despite the high fatality rate and absence of specific treatments, experts say it is very unlikely that the virus will lead to a global emergency. The first Nipah virus outbreak was reported in 1999 after the virus spread among pig farmers in Malaysia and Singapore. The virus has been named after the village where it was discovered.",

Suga, 30, is the third member of the septet to enlist in the military, following Jin in December 2022, and J-Hope in April this year. I was able to come this far thanks to you. And the time has come. I will faithfully complete my duty and come back, Suga wrote on fan community platform Weverse. Be careful of the chilly autumn weather. Stay healthy and see you all in 2025!, he added. Unlike Jin and J-Hope, Suga has been ruled unfit for the regular combat duty and will serve as a social service agent. While all able-bodied men must serve in the military, those with health issues may be assigned to alternative services, which include working in an office for a municipal government. Though reasons for the decision on Suga have not been disclosed, it is believed to be related to a surgery he had to repair a torn labrum in 2020. Mindful of the public nature of Sugas service, BigHit Music earlier urged the groups fans not to frequent Sugas place of duty. On Wednesday, Hybe said all seven members of BTS have agreed to resign their exclusive contracts with music label BigHit Music beginning in 2025 when they return from their military service one by one.

        "content": "Sri Lanka has reaffirmed its unwavering commitment to nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation by announcing its ratification of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT). Foreign Affairs Minister Ali Sabry joined a press briefing hosted by the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization (CTBTO) on Thursday (Sept. 21), convened as part of the EU Article 14 Conference on the CTBT. Minister Sabry, addressing the press briefing, revealed that Sri Lankas ratification of the CTBT, officially made in July 2023, aligns with the countrys long-standing and consistent policy on nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation. He recalled that Sri Lanka was among the first signatories of the CTBT in October 1996, only days after the treaty was opened for signature. The country was also the 13th to sign a facility agreement with the CTBTO in 1996, leading to the establishment of an auxiliary seismic station in Pallekale, Kandy, Minister Sabry added. During the briefing, the Sri Lankan foreign minister commended the relentless efforts of Robert Floyd, the Executive Director of the CTBTO, and the entire CTBTO team in promoting the entry into force of the treaty. The treaty has witnessed a steady increase in the number of state parties, showcasing global dedication to nuclear disarmament. Furthermore, Minister Sabry noted that Sri Lanka has actively supported the work of the CTBTO since the treatys adoption in 1996, including close collaboration with the On-Site Inspection (OSI) division. He announced that Sri Lanka would host the next OSI Integrated Field Exercise in 2025, bringing together 180 technical experts and participants from across the globe. This exercise will serve as a crucial opportunity to enhance the CTBTOs OSI capabilities and identify areas for further improvement. Minister Sabry acknowledged the treatys 26th anniversary this year and highlighted its importance as a cornerstone of the global nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation regime. The CTBT represents a significant collective confidence-building measure against nuclear testing, effectively deterring the nuclear arms race during the Cold War era. Speaking further, the foreign minister said, additionally, the treatys verification regime has established a robust international monitoring system and an international data centre, with applications extending beyond nuclear disarmament to civilian and scientific purposes. In the face of rising geopolitical tensions and recent challenges at the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) review conference, the Sri Lankan minister emphasized the CTBTs critical role in maintaining global security. Sri Lanka called upon all states, particularly those whose ratification is essential for the treatys entry into force, to take concrete steps toward ratification. Sri Lankas commitment to nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament remains steadfast, Minister Sabry assured, pledging the countrys unwavering support to achieving these critical objectives. The recent deposit of Sri Lankas instrument of accession to the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (TNPNW) further underlines its dedication to a nuclear-free world. Sri Lankas ratification of the CTBT reflects its enduring commitment to global peace and security through nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament.",

        "date": "September 22, 2023 04:04 pm",
        "content": "The Colombo District Court today (22 Sep.) ordered that the interim injunction preventing Sarath Ekanayake, who was appointed as General Secretary of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) after Dayasiri Jayasekaras expulsion, from serving in his new position, be further extended. Accordingly, the interim injunction was extended until 06 October, as per an order issued by Colombo District Judge Sandun Vithana this morning, after taking into consideration a petition filed by Jayasekara challenging SLFP leader and former President Maithripala Sirisenas decision to suspend his party membership. Appearing on behalf of the accused former President Sirisena, Presidents Counsel Faizer Mustapha informed the court that he opposes the relevant extension order, after which it was ordered that the objections be filed on the next court date. On 06 September, the General Secretary of SLFP MP Dayasiri Jayasekara said he was removed from the post and stripped of his party membership. The parliamentarian had received a letter, dated September 05, 2023, from the partys chairman and former President Sirisena, announcing the expulsion. The letter said Jayasekaras SLFP membership was revoked with effect from September 05 and that he could no longer serve as the partys general secretary. Later, on 18 September, Sirisena had directed another letter to Jayasekara, informing that a disciplinary inquiry would be conducted against Jayasekara and asking him for excuses. However, Jayasekara mentioned that pursuant to the SLFPs constitution, the party chairman has no authority to issue such letter asking for excuses. The Colombo District Court yesterday issued an interim injunction preventing the implementation of the letter issued by the SLFP chairman.",

        "content": "A resolution proposing the suspension of MP Ali Sabri Raheem from representing Parliamentary Committees was approved by the parliament on Friday (22 Sep.). Presenting the motion in parliament this morning, Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa stated that MP Sabris continued representation of Parliamentary Committees despite his recent involvement in illegal misconduct, has raised concerns and created a problematic situation in relation to the conduct of parliamentarians overall. Thus, the Parliament resolved that MP Sabri, who is currently under investigation by the Parliamentary Committee on Ethics and Privileges of Parliament, should not represent the Committees of Parliament until the said investigation is over. Speaking further in this regard, Premadasa stated that a fine of only Rs. 7.5 million has been imposed against the Puttalam District MP who illegally brought 3.3 kilograms of gold worth Rs. 74 million and 41 smartphones worth Rs. 4.2 million, while an exaggerated fine of Rs. 70 million was charged from a Frenchman who brought in a stock of gold worth Rs. 80 million. Thus, the Opposition Leader urged that an investigation be carried out into imposing a lenient fine against the MP. Puttalam District MP Ali Sabri Raheem was detained at the Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) in Katunayake along with a stock of undeclared gold and mobile phones on 23 May. The Customs officials on duty at the airport had impounded a total of 3.5kg of undeclared gold and 91 mobile phones from the possession of the parliamentarian who was returning to the island from overseas. However, the parliamentarian was later released after paying a fine of Rs. 7.5 million.",

        "date": "September 22, 2023 05:50 pm",
        "content": "Canadian PM Justin Trudeau has reiterated that there are credible reasons to believe that Indian agents may have been behind the murder of a Sikh separatist on Canadian soil. He first made the allegation on Monday, which India has strongly rejected, calling them absurd. Hardeep Singh Nijjar - who India designated a terrorist in 2020 - was shot dead outside a temple in June. Tensions between the two countries have flared after the allegation. The Indian government has often reacted sharply to demands by Sikh separatists in Western countries for Khalistan, or a separate Sikh homeland. Though India designated Nijjar a terrorist, his supporters reject the claim, saying he was a peaceful activist who backed the demand for a separate homeland for Sikhs. Mr Trudeaus accusation has fuelled an ugly diplomatic row between India and Canada, two countries that have historically shared close ties and good trade relations. Both countries have expelled a diplomat each of the other nation and on Thursday, India suspended visa services for Canadians. Meanwhile, Canada has reduced its personnel in India saying some diplomats had received threats on social media. On Thursday, Mr Trudeau spoke to reporters in New York at the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and repeated some of his earlier claims. As I said on Monday, there are credible reasons to believe that agents of the government of India were involved in the killing of a Canadian on Canadian soil, he said and added that by doing so, the country is standing up for the rules based international order that we believe in. When asked by a reporter to characterise how extensive and solid the evidence was, Mr Trudeau didnt give a direct answer but said that Canada had a rigorous and independent justice system and we allow those justice processes to unfold themselves with the utmost integrity. He also said that the decision to share these allegation was not done lightly but with the utmost seriousness. When asked if Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi had confirmed or denied these allegations, Mr Trudeau said he had had a direct and frank conversation with Mr Modi in which I shared my concerns in no uncertain terms. Mr Trudeau visited India earlier this month for the G20 summit during which he had a tense meeting with Mr Modi. India had then issued a sharp statement saying that it had strong concerns about continuing anti-India activities of extremist elements in Canada who it accused of promoting secessionism and inciting violence against Indian diplomats. Mr Trudeau said Canada would always defend freedom of expression while acting against hatred. Hours before Mr Trudeau spoke to the press on Thursday, Arindam Bagchi, a spokesperson for Indias foreign ministry, told reporters that India had made it clear that we are willing to look at any specific information that is provided to us. But so far we have not received any such specific information. The UK, Australia and the US have expressed concern over Canadas allegations. On Thursday, US National Security Advisor, Jake Sullivan, said that the US was consulting closely with its Canadian counterparts and has been in touch with the Indian government as well. I firmly reject the idea that there is a wedge between the US and Canada. We have deep concerns about the allegations, and we would like to see this investigation carried forward and the perpetrators held to account, he said. Source - BBC - Agencies",

        "content": "Commencing the National IT and BPM Week, the central event is slated for October 11, 12, and 13, 2023, at the Sirimavo Bandaranaike Memorial Exhibition Hall in Colombo, the Presidents Media Division (PMD) says. This initiative has been set in motion by expediting President Ranil Wickremesinghes program aimed at propelling the nation into the digital economy. The primary objective is to foster awareness of emerging technologies, facilitate skill development, offer career counselling and promote IT entrepreneurship. The programs target audience includes school students, both from public and private universities, vocational education institute students, job seekers and entrepreneurs within the Western Province. Over the course of three days, this program will provide a platform for industry insights and career guidance in IT and business processes. It will also open doors to internships and job opportunities, complemented by workshops on IT and business processes conducted by technical educational institutions. A media briefing on this significant endeavour took place today (Sept. 22), at the Presidential Media Centre (PMC). Key figures involved in this initiative were Janaka Sampath Geekianage, Director (Development) of the Ministry of Technology; Madhu Ratnayake, Chairman of the National Future Talent Initiatives Institute (NFTI); Jehan Perinpanayagam, Chairman of the Sri Lanka Society for Software Services Companies (SLASSCOM); and Prasad Samarawickrama, DIGIECON 2023-2030 Project Director. Sri Lankas IT and Business Process Management industry continues to experience remarkable growth, offering employment opportunities to over 144,000 professionals, the PMD said adding that the sector, with its unique role in the Sri Lankan economy, makes a substantial contribution to the countrys GDP. In the year 2022 alone, the sector generated approximately USD 1.7 billion. The government has ambitious plans to escalate this figure to 5 billion US dollars. On a global scale, the adoption of cutting-edge technologies like digitization, automation and artificial intelligence is witnessing a steep ascent. To align with these trends and achieve our desired objectives, prioritizing skill development is imperative. Furthermore, there is a vision to expand the workforce in this sector to 200,000 individuals by creating fresh employment opportunities for the youth of our nation. This industrys anticipated contribution of 15 to the countrys GDP will position Sri Lanka at the forefront of the economic landscape, fostering the growth of a more prosperous nation. In adherence to the directives of President Wickremesinghe and under the leadership of Minister of State for Technology Kanaka Herath, the Ministry of Technology and the Ministry of Education, in collaboration with key stakeholders including the Sri Lanka Export Development Board, the SLASSCOM, the Computer Society of Sri Lanka (CSSL), the Information Technology Industry Federation (FITIS), the Sri Lanka Information and Communication Technology Agency (ICTA) and other technical education institutes, are jointly orchestrating this program.",

The arrest was made by the Colombo Crimes Division (CCD). The organized criminal gang leader Nadun Chinthaka Wickramaratne alias Harak Katas, had reportedly attempted to flee from the custody of the CID on September 10. According to the CID, Harak Kata had been aided by a certain police constable, who had fled soon after the incident. Harak Kata, who was being interrogated by eight CID officers, had reportedly laced the officers tea with poison, with the help of the Police Constable in question, during his questioning. He had subsequently requested to go to the washroom, and was escorted out of the interrogation room with his aide  the constable, and another sub-inspector attached to the Police Special Task Force (STF), assigned for the suspects protection. Although his handcuffs were removed at that point, the underworld kingpin had then walked out of the washroom acting as if he was still cuffed and had then attempted to snatch the STF officers firearm leading to a scuffle. A group of other officers were quick to arrive at the scene of the incident upon hearing the commotion and detained Harak Kata in their custody. Amidst the altercation, the constable in question had reportedly fled the CID premises and remains in hiding to date. On September 18, the mother and brother-in-law of the police constable were arrested. The police also obtained a 90-day detention to interrogate them.",

On August 14, the government, by way of a special gazette notification, eased the restrictions on importing public transport buses and special-purpose heavy vehicles including, tankers, bowsers and fire trucks.

        "date": "September 23, 2023 01:39 pm",
        "content": "Director General of Trade Union Relations to the President Saman Ratnapriya has alleged that certain political factions are actively promoting racial conflicts in the country to further their own political agendas. Speaking at a press conference held in Colombo on Friday (22 Sep.), Ratnapriya accused several political factions and trade unions of being actively involved in various initiatives aimed at advancing their political agendas on various national issues. He further stated that the nation has already endured significant political and economic challenges over the past three decades, including the prolonged war and the Easter attacks, and emphasised that there is no need for the re-emergence of racial conflicts given that the country is now in the process of rebuilding after emerging from this dark period. Addressing the media briefing, Mr. Ratnapriya further said; Today, several political factions and trade unions are actively involved in various initiatives aimed at advancing their political agendas on various national issues. One of these initiatives pertains to the Channel 4 incident, currently under discussion in Parliament. Different political groups hold varying perspectives on this matter, with allegations that the government is reluctant to conduct a thorough investigation into the incident. This is not acceptable. President Ranil Wickremesinghe has taken steps to address the Channel 4 incident by appointing a committee consisting of a retired judge. This committee is responsible for making decisions regarding the matter. Additionally, the ruling party has called for the formation of a selection committee for this purpose. While everyone has the right to express their opinions freely, it is crucial that information concerning this issue is shared with a sense of responsibility and common sense. Its important to note that there has been no outright rejection of an investigation into the incident. The Ministry of Defence has also refuted these allegations. In this context, certain opposition groups are disseminating false information as part of their propaganda efforts. The Easter attack had a devastating impact on the country and it is imperative for the nation to determine those responsible and prevent such incidents from recurring. Previous interventions, including international investigations and presidential commissions, have been initiated in connection with the Easter incident. Seeking international support for this cause is not inherently problematic. Furthermore, there are groups attempting to incite racial tensions in the country to further their political objectives, with events such as Kurundi Viharaya and Thilipan celebrations being cited as examples. Both domestic and international communities suspect these groups of deliberately stoking conflict among the populace. Therefore, we urge all parties to refrain from dragging the country into turmoil for the sake of their political aspirations. The Easter attack inflicted significant political and economic damage on our nation. Additionally, the scars of a three-decade-long war still linger in our collective memory. It is crucial that we do not forget these dark chapters in our history. I earnestly urge all groups to conduct themselves in a manner befitting our countrys welfare. Today, as our country strives to recover from a severe economic crisis, various trade union campaigns are underway in the health department. Despite the economic challenges, the President has directed the Treasury to provide relief to public servants, including the possibility of salary or allowance increases. Protests are not uncommon in our country and if the government does decide to raise wages or allowances, they should effectively communicate that its in response to the concerns voiced by the working people. In these trying times when our country is grappling with financial difficulties, it is imperative that we collectively work towards the nations reconstruction, rather than dragging our feet on implementing necessary programs. During the implementation of the loan optimization program, certain trade unions have propagated false narratives, suggesting that the Employees Provident Fund (EPF) would be endangered. Such misinformation is counterproductive and its essential for trade unions to refrain from creating unwarranted panic. Only a small fraction of our population, 2500 out of 22 million, participated in the recent protests, indicating a broader acceptance of the Presidents agenda by the people. I implore all trade unions, including the opposition, to understand the current state of our nation and act with responsibility. Former Governor Mr. Rajith Keerthi Tennakoon; Professionals, including some within trade unions, have been disseminating misleading information. There have been claims of a brain drain occurring in the country, including reports that 842 doctors have left the country in the past. It is important to clarify that these 842 doctors left the country within the framework of labour laws, which include provisions for doctors on leave. Presenting this information in a distorted manner serves to conceal the genuine challenges within the healthcare sector. Rather than addressing existing concerns, there has been a focus on raising unfounded issues. It should be noted that the government has established specific procedures that allow government employees, including doctors, to work abroad. This can be regarded as a privilege extended to all government employees. It is incorrect to assert that professionals going abroad for leave equates to them permanently leaving the country. There has been a history of false propaganda on this matter. Claims suggesting that 6000 doctors have left the country lack an accurate understanding of the total number of doctors within our nation. With over 7500 doctors working in hospitals across the country, it is also misleading to suggest that doctors who pursue international training never return. The government is actively addressing this issue and monitoring the situation closely. Pulasthi Wanniarachchi Chairman of the United Social Organization: A Bill addressing Online System Security has been officially published. Simultaneously, during the Presidents visit to the United States, he held discussions with Facebooks President of Global Relations, focusing on future technical collaborations. The sudden introduction of this bill has sparked public discourse and its important to recognize its positive aspects. The Computer Response Emergency Forum records approximately 14,000 complaints annually related to social media and internet misuse, with the police receiving around 9,000 complaints. Social networking platforms have introduced certain social standards, but there remains a question regarding the extent of public awareness in our country. In the process of advancing digitization, it is essential to seek the insights of experts in the field when enacting such legislation. This bill, particularly targeting hate speech and fake news, is expected to contribute to their reduction. Furthermore, it is crucial to initiate a dialogue on the adverse effects of social networks and technology on our nation. The meeting was attended by Thusitha Perera, the co-convener of Civil Organizations and Trade Union, Kaushalee Samaratunga, Legal Adviser of the Lakvanitha Organization and Suppaiya Anandakumara, a member of Civil Organizations and Trade Unions.",

Addressing the UN Ministerial Meeting of the Summit of the Future at the United Nations headquarters, Minister Sabry stated that to do this, rebuilding trust and global solidarity will be critical and we need to ensure that commitments are implemented. He reiterated that the Summit must be closely aligned with the 2030 Agenda, the Addis Ababa Action Agenda, the outcomes of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Summit which just concluded, as well as other multilateral platforms such as the UNFCCC (United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change). Speaking further, he noted that ensuring a just global digital transformation that addresses the digital divide, threats from technologies, efforts to counter-terrorism and reform of the international financial architecture are priority areas for Sri Lanka. We failed the MDGs (Millennium Development Goals), and we are grappling to find a rescue plan for the SDGs. We dont need a summit which leaves us with another set of goals that are not achievable. We cannot let down our future generation. On the margins of the 78th UN General Assembly session in New York, Minister Sabry also met with Victoria Nuland, the US Under-Secretary for Political Affairs. During the discussion, Nuland asserted the United States support for a strong and prosperous Sri Lanka. The two sides have discussed US economic assistance, human rights and the shared vision for a free and open Indi-Pacific, the US Under Secretary said in a post on X, formerly Twitter.",

Sri Lanka repaid USD 100 million on September 02, 2023, and USD 50 million more on August 17, 2023. The island nation paid back the loan as its embattled economy is heading towards recovery from its worst economic crisis just a year ago. Its inflation rocketed to 69.8 percent in September last year. In July, however, inflation stood at 6.3 percent. On the other hand, Bangladesh is facing a foreign exchange crisis after its reserve dropped sharply in the past one and a half years owing to higher import bills compared to lower-than-expected remittance and export earnings.

The police found the bodies of three men piled on top of each other at the couples home, with their hands tied and their heads covered with plastic bags at 11:00 p.m. on Friday (22 Sep.), he said. Two victims were tenants renting a room within the premises, while the third victim was the couples son. Their ages range from their 20s to 40s. The neighbours reported the murders to the police after hearing shouts resembling a fight coming from the tenants unit, he said at a press conference at the Sentul District police headquarters on Saturday (23 Sep.). The 40-year-old couple and their son had known the suspects, who are supposedly from Klang, for six months, and they stayed at their house for two days. The police believe that the two suspects planned the murders, and the motive behind this altercation is still under investigation, he said, adding investigations were being conducted under Section 302 of the Penal Code for murder. Allaudeen said the married couple have been remanded for seven days to assist in the investigation, and all the bodies have been sent to the National Institute of Forensic Medicine, Kuala Lumpur Hospital, for post-mortem.

        "content": "French rapper MHD has been given a 12-year jail term for the murder of a young man in Paris in 2018. A court in the capital found the 29-year-old MHD, real name Mohamed Sylla, guilty of involvement in the gang-related killing of Loic K, 23. The victim was knocked down by MHDs Mercedes, then beaten and stabbed to death by a crowd of about 12 people. MHD, who is known for blending trap and West African music to get Afro trap, pleaded not guilty to the charges. From the beginning, I have maintained my innocence in this case and I will continue to maintain my innocence, he told the packed court in Paris, AFP news agency reports. He denied being at the scene of the murder, arguing that the case against him was based on rumours. However, a local resident filmed the incident in the summer of 2018 from his window, and the car was quickly identified as belonging to MHD. Other witnesses identified him by his haircut and a jumper, AFP reports. Five of MHDs co-defendants were also given prison terms ranging between 10 and 18 years. Another three were acquitted. It was not immediately known if those sentenced to jail were planning to appeal. MHD, who has a huge following on social media, was working as a pizza delivery boy in Paris before turning to music professionally. Five years ago, he spoke to BBCs Whats New? programme about how he came up with the idea of Afro trap. Source: BBC --Agencies",

        "content": "Sri Lanka defeated Pakistan in the Asian Games 2023 womens cricket event semi-final to face India in the gold medal match tomorrow (25). Earlier in the day, the Indian Women took Bangladesh with a nine-wicket margin to clinch the spot in the final. In the second semi-final, the Sri Lankan women won the toss and invited Pakistan to bat first. Justifying this decision, Inoshi Priyadharshani gave an early breakthrough after dismissing Sidra Ameen in the third over. The dismissal triggered a batting crisis for the Pakistanis as no batter could get going and manage a score over 16. Further, Udeshika Prabodhanis three-wicket haul helped Sri Lanka restrict Pakistan to 75-9 in 20 overs to set up a comfortable chase. Despite losing early wickets, steady knocks by Harshitha Samarawickrama and Nilakshi de Silva carried the Sri Lankans over the finish line to register a six-wicket win and qualify for the final. In the gold medal match, Sri Lanka and India will lock horns at the Pingfeng Campus Cricket Field, Hangzhou on September 25. Pakistan will lock horns against Bangladesh in the 3rd Place Playoff game for the bronze medal. --Agencies",

        "date": "September 24, 2023 04:42 pm",
        "content": "A 58-year-old man this week became the worlds second patient to receive a transplant of a genetically modified pig heart, the latest milestone in a growing field of medical research. Transplanting animal organs into humans, called xenotransplantation, could offer a solution to the chronic shortage of human organ donations. More than 100,000 Americans are currently on waiting lists for organ transplants. Both heart procedures were carried out by experts from the University of Maryland School of Medicine, with the first patient dying two months after his transplant last year due to a multitude of factors including his poor state of health prior to the operation, the university said in a statement Friday. The latest operation took place on Wednesday, with patient Lawrence Faucette ineligible for a donated human heart due to pre-existing vascular disease and internal bleeding complications. Without the experimental transplant, the father of two and Navy veteran was facing near-certain heart failure. My only real hope left is to go with the pig heart, the xenotransplant, Faucette was quoted as saying prior to the procedure. At least now I have hope, and I have a chance. Following the transplant, Faucette was breathing on his own and the new heart was functioning well without any assistance from supportive devices, the university said. He was taking conventional anti-rejection drugs as well as receiving a new antibody therapy to prevent his body from damaging or rejecting the new organ. Xenotransplants are challenging because the patients immune system will attack the foreign organ. Scientists are trying to circumvent the problem by using organs from genetically modified pigs. In the past few years, doctors have transplanted kidneys from genetically modified pigs into brain-dead patients. The NYU Langone Hospital Transplant Institute in New York announced this month that a pig kidney transplanted into a brain-dead patient had functioned for a record-breaking 61 days. Early xenotransplantation research focused on harvesting organs from primates -- for example, a baboon heart was transplanted into a newborn known as Baby Fae in 1984, but she survived only 20 days. Current efforts focus on pigs, which are thought to be ideal donors for humans because of their organ size, their rapid growth and large litters, and the fact they are already raised as a food source.

We have issued a set of guidelines in a circular regarding the food to be sold in canteens mentioning which foods are safe for school children and which foods can be sold in canteens. The school authorities and the individuals who maintain school canteens have been informed in this regard, he said. Furthermore, Mr. Rohana pointed out that although there are some issues pertaining to seeking legal action against those who act contrary to it under the Food Act, it is possible to take legal action in any case that creates issues regarding the health of the school children.

        "content": "The Chairman of the Planters Association of Ceylon, Senaka Alawattegama says that the country should focus on profitable industries such as palm cultivation as a measure in the agriculture sector to retain the foreign currency outflow and earn more foreign income by catering to the international market. Speaking at the annual general meeting of the Planters Association, Mr. Alawattegama further stressed that the unproductive rubber plantation lands can be converted to palm cultivation and that, however, government officials are still not cooperating even with the positive feedback from the President Ranil Wickremesinghe regarding the proposal. This can be accomplished by simply phasing out unproductive and unprofitable rubber, he said. At present, Sri Lanka consumes 220,000 Metric Tonnes of palm oil, but only 12 is produced locally. In 2023, the import bill associated with palm oil is approximately USD 300 million. We couldve substituted this with local production, but are simply choosing not to, based on what will benefit the fund-raising efforts of some activist groups and politicians alone, he alleged. We must be able to formulate policy based on facts and data, not slogans and other propaganda. Speaking further, the Planters Association Chairman emphasized that they have consistently provided evidence on how palm can be grown ethically and sustainably without harming the environment, adding that their contention today is that not only should the oil palm cultivation ban be completely reversed, it must also be sustainably expanded for regional plantation companies and small-holders alike. Meanwhile, the Indonesian Ambassador to Sri Lanka Dewi Tobing says that Indonesia is ready to provide expert knowledge to the plantation sector in the country, and come into partnership to combine the output of the agri products of both countries to cater to the growing international demand. Indonesia already experiencing how beneficial it is to the Indonesian economy and also to the people, she said. Indonesia is really keen to support Sri Lanka especially the expertise and knowledge of palm oil, which we already have. It shouldnt be competition, but a partnership, Tobing added.",

However, there is a better chance that those two will play a part in the World Cup. The chairperson of the Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) medical committee Arjuna de Silva said that medically it seems unlikely that Wanindu will be fit for much of the duration of the marquee tournament. He could be picked by selectors though, with hopes that he will be available at the end of the round-robin stage. But as per medical advice, such a move would be a significant risk. Hasaranga also missed out on the Asia Cup, where the Lankan Lions lost to India in the finals. Chameera is bowling in the nets and increasing his workload while recovering from a pectoral injury.

        "title": "Major asteroid sample brought to Earth in NASA first",
        "date": "September 24, 2023 10:03 pm",
        "content": "A seven-year space voyage came to its climactic end Sunday when a NASA capsule landed in the desert in the US state of Utah, carrying to Earth the largest asteroid samples ever collected. Scientists have high hopes for the sample, saying it will provide a better understanding of the formation of our solar system and how Earth became habitable. Touchdown of the Osiris-Rex sample return capsule! a commentator said on NASAs live video webcast of the landing. It completed a 3.86-billion-mile (6.21 billion-kilometer) journey. It marked the USs first sample return mission of its kind and will open a time capsule to the beginnings of our solar system, the US space agency said in a post on X, the former Twitter. The Osiris-Rex probes final, fiery descent through Earths atmosphere was perilous, but NASA managed to engineer a soft landing at 8:52 am local (1452 GMT), in the militarys Utah Test and Training Range. Four years after its 2016 launch, the probe had landed on the asteroid Bennu and collected roughly nine ounces (250 grams) of dust from its rocky surface. Even that small amount, NASA says, should help us better understand the types of asteroids that could threaten Earth and cast light on the earliest history of our solar system, NASA Administrator Bill Nelson said. This sample return is really historic, NASA scientist Amy Simon told AFP. This is going to be the biggest sample weve brought back since the Apollo moon rocks were returned to Earth. Osiris-Rex released the capsule early Sunday -- from an altitude of more than 67,000 miles (108,000 kilometers) -- some four hours before it landed. The fiery passage through the atmosphere came only in the last 13 minutes, as the capsule hurtled downward at a speed of more than 27,000 miles per hour, with temperatures of up to 5,000 Fahrenheit (2,760 Celsius). Its rapid descent, monitored by army sensors, was supposed to be slowed by two successive parachutes as it made its way to the 37-mile by nine-mile landing zone. The main chute, however, deployed much higher than was originally anticipated, at about 20,000 feet rather than the planned 5,000 feet, the NASA commentator said. NASA images showed the tire-sized capsule on the ground in a desert wash, with scientists approaching the device and taking readings. Meanwhile, the probe that made the space journey fired its engines and shifted course away from Earth, NASA said, on its way for a date with another asteroid, known as Apophis. Scientists predict that asteroid will come within 20,000 miles of Earth in 2029. - Japanese samples - The team will carefully airlift the device by helicopter to a temporary clean room nearby. NASA wants this done quickly and carefully to avoid any contamination of the sample with desert sands, skewing test results. On Monday the sample is to be flown by plane to NASAs Johnson Space Center in Houston. There, the box will be opened in another clean room. NASA plans to announce its first results at a news conference October 11. Most of the sample will be conserved for study by future generations. Roughly one-fourth will be immediately used in experiments, and a small amount will be sent to mission partners Japan and Canada. Japan had earlier given NASA a few grains from asteroid Ryugu, after bringing 0.2 ounces of dust to Earth in 2020 during the Hayabusa-2 mission. Ten years before, it had brought back a microscopic quantity from another asteroid. But the sample from Bennu is much larger, allowing for significantly more testing, Simon said. - Earths origin story - Asteroids are composed of the original materials of the solar system, dating back some 4.5 billion years, and have remained relatively intact. They can give us clues about how the solar system formed and evolved, said Osiris-Rex program executive Melissa Morris. Its our own origin story. By striking Earths surface, we do believe asteroids and comets delivered organic material, potentially water, that helped life flourish here on Earth, Simon said. Scientists believe Bennu, about 500 meters (1,640 feet) in diameter, is rich in carbon -- a building block of life on Earth -- and contains water molecules locked in minerals. Bennu surprised scientists in 2020 when the probe, during its brief contact with the asteroids surface, sank into the soil, revealing an unexpectedly low density, like a childrens pool filled with plastic balls. Understanding its composition could come in handy in the -- distant -- future. For there is a slight, but non-zero, chance (one in 2,700) that Bennu could collide catastrophically with Earth, though not until 2182. But NASA last year successfully deviated the course of an asteroid by crashing a probe into it in a test, and it might at some point need to repeat that exercise -- but with much higher stakes.

        "title": "President Macron says France will end its military presence in Niger, pull its ambassador after coup",
        "date": "September 25, 2023 08:25 am",
        "content": "PARIS (AP)  President Emmanuel Macron announced Sunday that France will end its military presence in Niger and pull its ambassador out of the country as a result of the coup that removed the democratically elected president. Nigers junta said in response that the announcement signals a new step towards the sovereignty of the country. Imperialist and neo-colonialist forces are no longer welcome on our national territory. The new era of cooperation, based on mutual respect and sovereignty is already underway, it said in a statement. The announcement was a significant, if expected, blow to Frances policy in Africa, with French troops having had to pull out of neighboring Mali and Burkina Faso in recent years after coups there. France had stationed thousands of troops in the Sahel region at the request of African leaders to fight Islamic extremist groups. France has maintained some 1,500 troops in Niger since the July coup, and had repeatedly refused an order by the new junta for its ambassador to leave, saying that France didnt recognize the coup leaders as legitimate. But tensions had mounted in recent weeks between France and Niger, a former French colony, and Macron said recently that French diplomats were surviving on military rations as they holed up in the embassy. Macrons announcement came after the coup leaders issued a statement earlier Sunday that they were closing Nigers airspace to French planes, commercial and military, so that the new leadership could retake total control of its skies and its territory. The decision did not apply to other international aircraft. Ali Sekou Ramadan, an aide to Nigers deposed President Mohamed Bazoum, told The Associated Press that Bazoum requested that Macron withdraw the French ambassador, Sylvain Itte, in order to reduce tension. In an interview with the France-2 and TF1 television networks, Macron said he spoke to Bazoum on Sunday and told him that France has decided to bring back its ambassador, and in the coming hours our ambassador and several diplomats will return to France. He added, And we will put an end to our military cooperation with the Niger authorities because they dont want to fight against terrorism anymore. He said the troops would be gradually pulled out, likely by the end of the year, in coordination with the coup leaders because we want it to take place peacefully. He said Frances military presence was in response to a request from Nigers government at the time. That military cooperation between France and Niger had been suspended since the coup, however. The junta leaders claimed Bazoums government wasnt doing enough to protect the country from the insurgency. The junta is now under sanctions by Western and regional African powers. Insa Garba Saidou, a local activist who assists Nigers new military rulers with their communications, said they would continue to monitor developments until the French ambassador leaves the country. He also demanded a clear deadline for the withdrawal of the French troops. This announcement from the French president announces the victory of the people of Niger. However, we are going to take it with a lot of reservation because I no longer believe in Mr. Macron, said Saidou. The junta in August gave the French ambassador 48 hours to leave. After the deadline expired without France recalling him, the coup leaders then revoked his diplomatic immunity. In New York on Friday, the military government that seized power in Niger accused U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres of obstructing the West African nations full participation at the U.N.s annual meeting of world leaders in order to appease France and its allies. Experts say that after repeated military interventions in its former colonies in recent decades, the era of France as Africas gendarme may finally be over, as the continents priorities shift. Andrew Lebovich, a research fellow with the Clingendael Institute, a think tank, said the decision marks both an acceptance of a harsh reality for France in the region and may possibly put some limits on the U.S. deployments in Niger, though as we have seen, the U.S. and France have not followed exactly the same positionings in Niger. Rida Lyammouri, a senior fellow at the Policy Center for the New South, a Morocco-based think tank, said Niger will feel the loss of French support in its fight against violent extremist groups. France has been a reliable partner providing support to its operations and Niger simply doesnt have an alternative to fill this void by the French, at least in short and mid term, Lyammouri said. Macron last year withdrew French troops from Mali following tensions with the ruling junta after a 2020 coup, and more recently from Burkina Faso, for similar reasons. Both African countries had asked for the French forces to leave. France also suspended military operations with Central African Republic, accusing its government of failing to stop a massive anti-French disinformation campaign.

The country now needs to take a look at its policy decisions driven by strong vested interests of military, political and business leaders, as per the World Bank. The warning by the financial institution comes ahead of the new election cycle so that the upcoming government can make early choices. The World Bank has asked Pakistan to tax its agriculture and real estate to achieve economic stability through steep fiscal adjustment of over seven per cent of the size of the economy, as per Pakistan-based The Express Tribune newspaper. The lender on Friday also revealed that poverty in Pakistan shot up to 39.4 per cent as of last fiscal year with 12.5 million more people falling into the trap due to poor economic conditions. About 95 million Pakistanis now live in poverty. The Washington-based lender unveiled the draft policy notes that it prepared with the help of all stakeholders for the next government. The lender identified low human development, unsustainable fiscal situation, over-regulated private sector, agriculture and energy sectors as the priority areas for reforms for the next government. The World Bank proposed measures that immediately increase the tax-to-GDP ratio by five per cent and cut expenditures by about 2.7 per cent of GDP, aimed at putting the unsustainable economy back on a prudent fiscal path, according to the Express Tribune. Meanwhile, the WBs lead country economist Tobias Haque said the bank is deeply concerned about the economic situation of today. Pakistan is facing serious economic and human development crises and it is at a point where major policy shifts are required, he added. The banks note on strengthening government revenues showed a host of measures to improve the revenue-to-GDP ratio by five per cent through the withdrawal of tax exemptions and increasing the burden of taxes on the real estate and the agriculture sectors, as per The Express Tribune.

However, the overseas travel ban imposed on him will continue to remain in effect, on the orders of the Colombo Magistrates Court. Senanayake was arrested on 06 September, after he reportedly surrendered to the Special Investigations Unit of the Sports Ministry, over match-fixing allegations levelled against him. The 38-year-old had allegedly approached two cricketers participating in the first edition of the Lanka Premier League (LPL) in 2020 via phone calls from Dubai, instigating them to fix matches during the tournament. The Lanka Premier League was held from November 27 to December 17, 2020 in Hambantota, Sri Lanka.

Sri Lanka women could only score 97-8 in the chase of 117. For Sri Lanka to chase down the target, they needed a special innings from captain Chamari Attapattu but the batter was out for 12. Hasini Perera (25) played a couple of crisp shots and revived the chase with a 36-run partnership with Nilakshi de Silva (23) but the damage was already done. India women won the toss and opted to bat on a sluggish pitch. Apart from Smriti Mandhana and Jemimah Rodrigues, who scored 46 and 42 respectively, none of the batters were able to resist the Sri Lanka batting. India lost Shafali Varma early but Mandhana and Rodrigues stabilised the innings with a 73-run partnership. India were going at 6 till the 15th over and was set to go berserk in the final five overs. However, both Mandhana and Rodrigues fell in quick succession and India suffered a huge collapse, being reduced to 116-7 in 20 overs. This is Indias second gold in Asian games so far. Earlier, the mens 10m air rifle team, consisting of Rudrankksh Patil, Aishwary Pratap Singh Tomar and Divyansh Singh Panwar, bagged gold for India. India so far has bagged 11 medals, including 2 Golds, 3 Silvers and 6 Bronze. Meanwhile, this is Sri Lankas first medal in 2023 Asian Games being held in Hangzhou, China. --Agencies",

        "content": "The Philippines will take all appropriate actions to cause the removal of barriers in a disputed area of the South China Sea, the countrys national security advisor said on Monday. The Philippines on Sunday shared images of a floating barrier blocking fishing vessel access in the Scarborough Shoal with Chinese coast guard ships nearby, and said it would protect the rights of its fishermen. We condemn the installation of floating barriers by Chinese coast guard, national security adviser Eduardo Año said in a statement. The placement by the Peoples Republic of China of a barrier violates the traditional fishing rights of our fishermen, he added. The countrys foreign ministry on Monday said that the barriers were a violation of international law and that the Philippines would take all appropriate measures to protect our countrys sovereignty and the livelihood of our fisherfolk. The Chinese embassy in Manila did not respond to requests for comment. China claims 90 of the South China Sea, overlapping with the exclusive economic zones of Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei, Indonesia and the Philippines. Beijing seized the Scarborough Shoal in 2012 and forced fishermen from the Philippines to travel further for smaller catches. Philippine coast guard and fisheries bureau personnel discovered the floating barrier, estimated at 300 m (1,000 feet) long, on a routine patrol on Friday near the shoal, locally known as Bajo de Masinloc, according to Commodore Jay Tarriela, a coast guard spokesperson. We have to be very careful (not to commit) any diplomatic misstep, Tarriela said in a radio interview on Monday before the governments comments, when asked whether the coast guard was planning to remove the barrier. Tarriela said that according to Filipino fishermen, the Chinese coast guard usually installs such barriers when they monitor a large number of fishermen in the area, then remove it later.

Nicholas Johnson KC, prosecuting, confirmed the Crown was not pursuing a retrial on the other five outstanding allegations involving two baby girls and two baby boys.

        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe has called for a fresh analysis of the life and character of King Sitawaka Rajasingha, a courageous and patriotic king of historical significance. He stated this while speaking at the Sitawaka  Sisu Arunalu program held at Rajasingha Central College Hanwella this morning (25), to distributed school equipment and uniforms to 12,000 schoolchildren, which was made possible through the support of the Chinese government. The President emphasized that King Rajasingha, has been overshadowed by history due to a reference in Chulavansa made two centuries after his reign. President Wickremesinghe urged a reconsideration of the historical approach that has favoured victorious figures while neglecting those who faced defeat. Symbolizing the distribution of school equipment and uniforms, the President presented school equipment to several students during the event. It is worth mentioning that this assistance is a direct outcome of the Prime Ministers visit to China. Hanwella, Avissawella, situated in the Western Province, boasts an advanced education system. The Prime Minister is making a substantial commitment towards its further development. Highlighting the significance of preserving historical and cultural heritage, President Wickremesinghe revealed that he has instructed the Department of Archaeology to explore the archaeological treasures of Sitawaka Kingdom. This effort aims to shed light on the historical significance of the region and pave the way for the construction of a museum dedicated to Sitawakas history. President Wickremesinghe emphasized the need for the countrys children to receive both modern education and knowledge about Sri Lankas rich cultural history. He expressed his commitment to ensuring that Sri Lankan youth are equipped with the skills and knowledge necessary to shape the nations future. Furthermore, President Wickremesinghe called for a re-evaluation of the character and history of King Sitawaka Rajasingha, suggesting that the narrative surrounding those who lost battles in history should be reconsidered. In an effort to encourage knowledge-sharing, President Wickremesinghe invited local school students to submit facts about the Kingdom of Sitawaka and King Sitawaka Rajasingha. He pledged to reward the school that submits the most compelling information. Despite recent economic challenges, President Wickremesinghe assured that the government remains committed to allocating more resources for free education and healthcare. He expressed his dissatisfaction with the current education system and his determination to transform Sri Lanka into a vocational training centre while providing children with an education system that empowers them for the future. Regarding the General Certificate of Education (GCE) at both Ordinary and Advanced Levels, there is a coexistence of the public school education system and private tuition services. This situation entails significant parental investment in education. The government is actively seeking input from educators and students to develop a new education system that addresses these aspects. Additionally, efforts are underway to create an environment conducive to providing professional education to children. The government aims to transform Sri Lanka into a hub for vocational training through the reorganization of vocational education programs. This initiative aims to equip citizens with the necessary professional knowledge for the nations future development, following models adopted by countries like Australia. During the event, a poem was recited in honour of King Rajasingha, highlighting his historic significance. King Rajasinghas actions are recognized for preventing Sri Lanka from facing a fate similar to Mozambique or Angola and for being the only South Asian king to successfully defeat the Portuguese. President Ranil Wickremesinghe expressed the importance of preserving the historical legacy of Kingdom of Sitawaka, emphasizing its role in safeguarding Sri Lankas independence. To ensure this heritage is passed down to future generations, he announced plans to establish a museum in the Sitawaka area. Furthermore, the President instructed Chief of Defence Staff Mr. Shavendra Silva to oversee the construction of memorials at key historical battle sites, such as Mulleriyawa and Danthurei. These efforts aim to commemorate the bravery and sacrifices of those who contributed to Sri Lankas history. President Wickremesinghe emphasized the need to revisit the legacy of King Sitawaka Rajasingha, a courageous and patriotic leader who has been overlooked by history. He pointed out that historical accounts, like Chulavansa, have often favoured winners over losers, neglecting those who lost battles. As a result, he called for a re-evaluation of King Sitawaka Rajasinghas character and contributions. In addition, President Wickremesinghe instructed the Department of Archaeology to commence work on preserving the archaeological significance of the Sitawaka region, which is expected to undergo rapid urbanization in the coming years. This proactive approach aims to safeguard the historical heritage of Sitawaka from potential loss, similar to what occurred in the city of Kotte. President Wickremesinghe stressed the importance of understanding the past while building the future. To encourage this, he invited students from Sitawaka schools to submit essays detailing the history of Kingdom of Sitawaka. A prize will be awarded to the school with the most outstanding submission, promoting a deeper appreciation of Sri Lankas historical heritage among the youth. Meanwhile Prime Minister Dinesh Gunawardena underscored the significance of education as a vital investment in the countrys future. He emphasized the governments unwavering commitment to the educational sector and acknowledged the importance of providing essential school equipment, generously provided by the Chinese government, to students. The Prime Minister also paid tribute to the historical role of Rajasingha Central College Hanwella as the first Central College in the Kelani Valley, which has educated numerous students who have gone on to contribute significantly to the nations development. He emphasized the collective efforts of various governments that have made substantial contributions to the growth and advancement of Rajasingha Central College, Hanwella. Mr. Qi Zhenhong, the Chinese Ambassador to Sri Lanka also highlighted the strong and friendly partnership between China and Sri Lanka, characterized by mutual respect and trust. He emphasized the collaborative nature of the relationship, where both nations consistently support and assist each other. Acknowledging the temporary difficulties faced by the Sri Lankan people, Ambassador Qi expressed confidence that, under the leadership of President Mr. Ranil Wickremesinghe and Prime Minister Mr. Dinesh Gunawardena, the country would overcome these challenges and pave the way for a brighter future. Ambassador Qi reiterated Chinas commitment to supporting Sri Lanka in achieving sustainable development and addressing prevailing economic issues. The event was attended by Justice Minister Dr. Wijayadasa Rajapaksa, Public Security Minister Tiran Alas, Members of Parliament Jagath Kumara and Yadamini Gunawardena, Western Province Governor Marshal of the Air Force Roshan Gunathilake, Jagath Surasena Principal, Rajasingha Central College as well as teachers, parents, students and other dignitaries. --PMD",

        "content": "The reason why the United States sees China as an ever-bigger threat is not just because of its status as the worlds second-largest economy. It is primarily because China presents an alternative development model distinct from that advocated by the US and its western allies, Tamara Kunanayakam, former permanent representative of Sri Lanka to the United Nations Office in Geneva, told China Daily. The US has been promoting the neoliberal model to shift the decision-making power out of other countries into their hands, contributing to rising inequality and conflicts, which is being now challenged and questioned all around, Kunanayakam said. She said that numerous countries, including Sri Lanka, are exploring alternatives to the US-led model. They are intrigued by how China, despite being a developing nation, has successfully pursued its unique path, particularly in eradicating extreme poverty. Unlike other countries that trigger confrontation and war, China prioritizes cooperation and sharing, which brings well-being to the people, the former representative said. Its an example of what can be done, and that is a threat to the US, she said. Source: China Daily --Agencies",

        "title": "SP raises Sri Lanka local currency ratings to CCCC, says outlook stable",
        "date": "September 26, 2023 09:47 am",
        "content": "SP Global Ratings on Monday (Sept. 25) raised its long- and short-term local currency sovereign credit ratings on Sri Lanka to CCCC from SDSD (selective default). At the same time, the credit rating agency affirmed its SDSD long- and short-term foreign currency ratings. In a statement, SP Global Ratings said the outlook on the CCC long-term local currency rating is stable, adding that it has also raised the issue rating on Sri Lankas local currency bond maturing in October 2023 to CCC from D. Outlook The New York-based credit rating agencys long-term foreign currency rating on Sri Lanka is SD. The company said it does not assign outlooks to SD ratings because they express a condition and not a forward-looking opinion of default probability. The stable outlook on the long-term local currency rating reflects the balance of improvements to the governments debt profile achieved through its domestic restructuring exercises against the continued risk to the governments fiscal sustainability posed by Sri Lankas ongoing economic, external, and fiscal pressures. Downside scenario SP Global Ratings said it could lower the long-term local currency ratings on Sri Lanka if there are indications of further restructuring of obligations denominated in Sri Lankan rupees (LKR) to commercial creditors. Developments that could precede these indications include a rapid rise in inflation, a further rise in the governments interest burden, or a significantly worse fiscal performance by the government leading to local currency funding pressures. Upside scenario Further, SP Global Ratings said it could raise the long-term local currency sovereign credit rating on Sri Lanka if it perceives that the sustainability of the governments large local currency debt stock has improved further. This could be the case if, for example, the governments fiscal metrics, and the performance of the Sri Lankan economy, improve much more quickly than it expects. The credit rating agency added that it could raise its long-term foreign currency sovereign credit rating upon completion of the governments bond restructuring. The rating would reflect Sri Lankas creditworthiness post-restructuring. SP Global Ratings post-restructuring ratings tend to be in the CCC or low B categories, depending on the sovereigns new debt structure and capacity to support that debt. Rationale SP Global Ratings noted that it raised its local currency ratings on Sri Lanka to CCCC to reflect a forward-looking opinion about Sri Lankas creditworthiness on local currency obligations following the completion of the governments domestic debt exchange program with superannuation funds. The credit rating agency has viewed this exchange as distressed rather than opportunistic due to the governments very high interest burden and local currency debt stock. The agency opined that the restructuring also resulted in lenders receiving less than originally promised. SP Global Ratings also raised the rating on Sri Lankas October 2023 local currency bond to CCC, in line with the change in the sovereign credit rating. Sri Lanka also completed on Sept. 21, 2023, a separate restructuring exercise on its debt owed to the Central Bank of Sri Lanka. Outstanding provisional advances and Treasury bills held by the central bank were converted primarily into Treasury bonds with maturities in 2029-2038, carrying fixed interest rates that will step down in 2025 and 2027. A much smaller portion of the outstanding credits have been converted to short-term Treasury bills. SP Global Ratings says its sovereign ratings do not reflect the governments capacity and willingness to service financial obligations to public sector enterprises or similar official creditors. Nevertheless, the credit rating agency views the completion of this restructuring exercise, in addition to the restructuring to superannuation funds, as supportive of Sri Lankas near-term creditworthiness on its local currency obligations because it will further reduce refinancing needs as well as the governments interest bill. In its view, the successful completion of the domestic debt exchange with superannuation funds suggests that the government will continue to service its unaffected outstanding local currency bonds in the near term. However, Sri Lanka remains dependent upon favorable economic developments to continue to meet its financial commitments, the statement read further. As of May 2023, local currency-denominated Treasury bills and bonds outstanding were approximately LKR 14.1 trillion, or about 60 of GDP. Sri Lankas restructuring exercises on some of these obligations will not affect the size of the outstanding debt stock because there is no haircut on the value of the notes. Banks, which were not included in the domestic debt exchange program on local currency bonds, are estimated to hold approximately 27 of Treasury bills and 43 of Treasury bonds. Although Sri Lankas ongoing restructuring efforts will help to stabilize the governments fiscal dynamics, net general government indebtedness will remain at a very high level of more than 100 of GDP through at least 2026, in SP Global Ratings assessment. Likewise, the credit rating agency estimate that the governments interest burden will be more than 70 of revenues for 2023, and will remain above 50 in 2026. It says these outcomes will be highly dependent on the pace of nominal GDP growth, fiscal consolidation and revenue growth, prevailing interest rates in the economy, and future restructuring outcomes, among other variables. -- SP Global Ratings",

        "content": "Two suspects have surrendered to the Malaysian police over the murder of three Sri Lankans in Sentul, Kuala Lumpur. According to the Sri Lankan High Commission in Kuala Lumpur, the two suspects in question are also Sri Lankans. On Friday (Sept. 22), the Malaysian police found the bodies of three men piled up on top of each other, with their limbs tied and heads covered in plastic bags, at a shophouse on Perhentian Street in Lower Kovil Village, Sentul. The shophouse was found to be owned by a married couple. The couples son was also among the victims. The other two victims were reportedly tenants renting a room within the premises. They were aged between 20 and 40 years. The police later revealed that they were on a manhunt for two Sri Lankan suspects, who were staying at the couples place on the second floor of the shophouse. However, it was not immediately clear whether the two suspects who surrendered were the duo sought by the police. The neighbours had reported the murders to the police after hearing shouts resembling a fight coming from the establishment. Kuala Lumpur police chief Datuk Allaudeen Abdul Majid was quoted as saying the 40-year-old couple and their son had known the suspects, who are supposedly from Klang, for six months. The duo had stayed at their house for two days. The motive behind the murders is yet to be ascertained.",

        "date": "September 26, 2023 11:25 am",
        "content": "Sri Lankan Foreign Minister Ali Sabry on Monday, reacting to the India-Canada diplomatic row, said terrorists have found safe haven in Canada and their Prime Minister Justin Trudeau came out with the outrageous allegations without any proof. Speaking exclusively to ANI, Mr Sabry said he is not surprised by his remarks since Trudeau keeps making outrageous and substantiated allegations. Some of the terrorists have found safe haven in Canada. The Canadian PM has this way of just coming out with some outrageous allegations without any supporting proof. The same thing they did for Sri Lanka, a terrible, total lie about saying that Sri Lanka had a genocide. Everybody knows there was no genocide in our country, he said. India-Canada ties hit a new low after Justin Trudeau on September 18 alleged Indias involvement in the fatal shooting of Khalistan Tiger Force chief Hardeep Singh Nijjar in Canada. Nijjar, a designated terrorist in India, was killed outside a gurdwara in Canadas Surrey on June 18. India had rejected the allegations as absurd and motivated. Taking a dig at Trudeau for honouring a former Nazi soldier in Canadas parliament, he said, I saw yesterday he had gone and given a rousing welcome to somebody who has associated with the Nazis in the past during the Second World War. So, this is questionable and we have dealt with it in the past. I am not surprised that sometimes PM Trudeau comes out with outrageous and substantiated allegations. Last Friday, during Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskys speech in the Canadian Parliament, 98-year-old Ukrainian Yaroslav Hunka, who served in the first Ukrainian division, also known as the SS division Galicia during World War II, was honoured by the Speaker of Canadas House of Commons. Mr Sabry said Trudeaus genocide comment had affected Sri Lanka- Canada ties. That has actually affected our relationship. The Foreign Ministry has a different take on that. Ministry of Global Affairs has very clearly said that Sri Lanka did not go through a genocide, whereas PM Trudeau as a politician stands up and says that genocide had taken place. That itself is contradictory to each other. That doesnt help, said Mr Sabry. He also advised the Canadian PM not to interfere in the internal matters of a sovereign country. I dont think anyone should poke their nose into other countries and tell as to how we should govern our country. We love our country more than anyone else. Thats why we are in our country. We are not very happy about that statement at all. Indian Ocean identity is very important and we need to strengthen the regional architecture. We have to look after our region. We need to work together. Thats how we can create a peaceful environment. We should not be dictated by anyone else as to how we should conduct our affairs, he added. Sri Lanka had earlier rejected Trudeaus statement containing outrageous claims of genocide relating to the past conflict in Sri Lanka. The Sri Lankan foreign ministry said such irresponsible and polarizing pronouncements by the leader of a nation breeds disharmony and hatred both in Canada and Sri Lanka, instead of promoting peace and reconciliation.

        "date": "September 26, 2023 11:48 am",
        "content": "Sri Lankan Foreign Minister Ali Sabry on Monday said that Colombo has not given permission to a Chinese vessel to dock, adding that Indian security concerns are important for Sri Lanka. Asked about reports regarding a Chinese research vessel named Shi Yan 6 scheduled to be docked in Sri Lanka in October and Indias concerns regarding it, he said that they have a standard operating procedure (SOP) and they have consulted many friends, including India. Thats a conversation going on for some period of time. India has expressed its concerns over a long time, but we have come out with the SOP (standard operating procedure). When we were making that, we consulted many of our friends, including India. So, as long as it complies with the SOP, we have no problem. But if it doesnt comply with the SOP, we have a problem, Ali Sabry told ANI. He said that Sri Lanka has not given permission for the Chinese vessel Shi Yan 6 to dock in October, adding that negotiations are going on. So, therefore, as far as I know, we have not given permission to come to Sri Lanka during October. Negotiations are going on. Indian security concerns, which are legitimate, are very, very important for us. We have always told that because we want to keep our region a zone of peace, said Ali Sabry. Sri Lankan President Ranil Wickremesinghe too had said that an SPO had been worked out for foreign vessels. The Chinese research vessel was expected in Sri Lanka in October to conduct research along with the National Aquatic Resources Research and Development Agency (NARA), media reports had said earlier. US Under Secretary Victoria Nuland, during her meeting with Sri Lankan Foreign Minister Ali Sabry, had raised concerns regarding Shi Yan 6s visit. Taking to X, formerly Twitter, Victoria Nuland stated, The US supports a strong and prosperous Sri Lanka. Our work together continues at UNGA. I met with MFA_SriLanka Minister Ali Sabry to discuss U.S. economic assistance, human rights, and our shared vision for a free and open Indo-Pacific. Sabry had told Nuland that Sri Lanka had worked out the SOP to be followed by foreign ships and aircraft in carrying out any activity in Sri Lankan territory, according to media reports. Reportedly, he told her that Sri Lanka had been even-handed in this approach for all nations and could not exclude China from the process. The two leaders held a meeting on the sidelines of the 78th session of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA). Last year, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar, while commenting on Chinese spy vessel Yuan Wang-5 which had docked in Sri Lanka, said that any developments that have a bearing on Indias security are obviously of an interest to us. What happens in our neighbourhood, any developments which have a bearing on our security obviously are of an interest to us, Mr Jaishankar said at a joint press conference after the 9th India-Thailand Joint Commission Meeting. India had expressed its security concerns over the docking of the vessel at the Sri Lankan port as it was shown as a research vessel with the capability of mapping the ocean bed, which is critical to anti-submarine operations of the Chinese Navy. The Chinese research ship had docked at Sri Lankas Hambantota Port. Source: ANI -Agencies",

        "date": "September 26, 2023 12:28 pm",
        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe is due to meet with the visiting team of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) today (26 Sep.). This meeting will be the last in the series of meetings held between the IMF team and representatives of the Sri Lankan government since 14 September, when discussions pertaining to the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) programme review commenced. Following todays meeting, the two sides will sign an agreement on the second tranche of the IMFs bailout package. The inaugural meeting for the IMFs first review of the EFF for Sri Lanka commenced in Colombo on 14 September, with Finance State Minister Shehan Semasinghe, Presidents Senior Adviser on National Security and Chief of Staff Sagala Ratnayaka, Presidents Secretary Saman Ekanayake, Advisor to the President on Economic Affairs Dr. R.H.S. Samaratunga, Finance Ministry Secretary Mahinda Siriwardana and Central Bank Governor Dr. Nandalal Weerasinghe representing the Sri Lankan government, while the IMF delegation featured prominent figures such as Peter Breuer (Senior Mission Chief), Katya Svirydzenka (Deputy Mission Chief), Mike Li, Sophia Zhang, Dmitriy Rozhkov, Noda Selim, Sandesh Dhungana, Nui Miao, Mark Adams (virtual), Joei Turkewitz, Nuong Lan Vu. During the review, Sri Lanka was tasked with convincing the IMF officials that it has met the key goals of the bailout program to continue the debt restructuring efforts that are crucial to its economic recovery process. The first review was deemed a significant milestone towards securing the second tranche of the IMF loan and enhancing confidence in Sri Lankas economic recovery, State Minister of Finance Shehan Semasinghe said, adding that the successful completion of the first IMF review puts the country in a strong position for economic recovery and sets a promising pathway for growth in 2024. Sri Lanka, grappling with its worst financial crisis in more than seven decades after its foreign exchange reserves depleted to record lows, managed to secure a bailout package of nearly USD 3 billion in March 2023. The IMFs executive board had approved a 48-month arrangement of SDR 2.286 billion (USD 2.9 billion) supported by the EFF to help Sri Lanka ride out its economic crisis. The loan program aims to restore Sri Lankas macroeconomic stability and debt sustainability, mitigating the economic impact on the poor and vulnerable, safeguarding financial sector stability, and strengthening governance and growth potential. It also allows Sri Lanka to access financing of up to USD 7 billion from international financial institutions (IFIs) and multilateral organizations. Under the IMF program, Sri Lanka has set a target of restructuring its debt for the next 10 years and reducing its debt-to-GDP ratio from the current 120 to about 95 by 2032. However, Sri Lanka still needs to complete talks with key bilateral creditors, including Japan, China and India, before it can take the next step to restructure its debt.",
