Speaking at a public rally in Ruwanwella, Dissanayake stated, There is a need to build the economy, and it will take some time to see significant growth. However, we can achieve an immediate boost in the tourism industry. I plan to attract 4 million tourists, which will contribute to an 8 billion dollar economy. He also emphasized his plans for the IT industry, saying, Currently, the export economy is valued at 1.2 billion dollars. My goal is to increase it to 5 billion dollars and create 200,000 software engineering jobs in Sri Lanka. He pointed out that currently, 50 percent of multi-day fishing boats are left stranded due to inadequate planning, resulting in substantial financial losses, estimated between Rs. 500,000 to Rs. 01 million for each boat. He emphasized the need for subsidies to support fishermen and to develop a strategic plan to effectively utilize the maritime resources. He assured that local farmers will be supported, stating, If the farmers in this country are capable of producing the onions we need, we will stop importing them. We will only import rice necessary for the tourism industry; not a single other grain of rice will be imported from abroad.",

        "title": "Pakistan-Sri Lanka trade dispute unresolved: Report",
        "date": "September 18, 2024 11:26 am",
        "content": "Pakistan and Sri Lanka have yet to operationalise a bilateral dispute resolution body, nearly two decades after signing a treaty, leaving trade disputes unresolved. This could potentially harm Pakistans exports to the island nation. On Monday, Pakistans Ministry of Commerce informed a Senate Standing Committee on Commerce that Sri Lankan authorities were uncooperative, suggesting the issue now needs to be addressed at the political level. Senator Anusha Rahman of the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) chaired the meeting. Initially, ministry officials implied the dispute resolution forum was effective but later admitted Sri Lankas lack of cooperation. We have friendly relations with Sri Lanka and want to amicably resolve the trade disputes, said Pakistans Minister for Commerce Jam Kamal. Dr Adnan, Joint Secretary at the Ministry of Commerce, stated, The Pakistan-Sri Lanka FTA is the only treaty that covers both government-to-government and business-to-business disputes. He added that since 2013, Pakistan has raised concerns about the dispute resolution mechanisms. It was later agreed to form a joint working group to address these issues. The Free Trade Agreement (FTA) was signed in 2005, making it the only trade treaty between the two nations that includes a dispute resolution mechanism for commercial entities. However, Sri Lanka has yet to designate a nodal chamber and arbitration mechanism. The committee chairperson urged the Ministry of Commerce to expedite resolving this issue. Dr Adnan also mentioned that Sri Lanka recently proposed utilising existing mechanisms such as commercial arbitration and the judicial process, as trade disputes often involve determining the rights and obligations of sellers and buyers. In December 2022, Pakistan proposed an arbitration forum with two nominations from each side. While Sri Lanka initially agreed, it later claimed to have lost the meeting minutes, hindering progress, Adnan noted. Due to the dysfunctional dispute resolution mechanism, Pakistani exporters have been unable to claim disputed export proceeds. The committee was informed that Pakistans Trade and Investment attach√© had raised the issue with Sri Lanka, which advised using letters of credit (LCs) instead of bills of engagement for trade transactions. The commerce minister indicated the need to involve Pakistans Ministry of Foreign Affairs to address the matter at a political level. Additionally, Senator Anusha Rahman expressed concern over the Ministry of Commerces reluctance to accept parliamentarians nominations to the board of the Trade Development Authority of Pakistan (TDAP), despite it being a legal requirement. The committee scrutinised Senator Faisal Saleem Rehmans nomination to the TDAP board for the 2021-24 term. The committee demanded an explanation for why he wasnt appointed and how he was removed without notification. Senator Saleem pointed out that despite his nomination by the Senate in 2021, neither the Ministry of Commerce nor TDAP acknowledged his membership. The additional secretary noted that the issue had been raised in the Federal Cabinet and is now under review by the Ministry of Law. The additional secretary explained that the State-Owned Enterprises (SOE) Act prohibits parliamentarians from being appointed to the boards of SOEs. However, Senator Rahman countered, stating that TDAP is not classified as an SOE by the Ministry of Finance, accusing the commerce ministry of manipulating its status to exclude Parliaments oversight. Senator Rahman further emphasised that the Ministry of Commerces interpretation of the law was contradictory to the Ministry of Finances position. She stressed the need to uphold TDAP regulations and questioned the ministrys reluctance in appointing parliamentarians to the TDAP board. The SOE Act, 2023 only prohibits parliamentarians on the slots allocated for independent directors on TDAP board and does not apply to parliamentarians. Commerce Minister Jam Kamal assured the committee that the issue would be resolved promptly. The committee chairperson called for a detailed report, including records of notifications, details of the TDAP chief executive during the 2021-24 period, and the names of officials responsible for the legal misinterpretation.

        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe assured that English language proficiency would be made accessible to every child through the implementation of the English for All program within the next decade. In the first two years, we will focus on training teachers and then extend training to others. We will also provide opportunities for private institutions to register and teach English. Within 10 years, we can significantly improve English proficiency across the country, he said. The President claimed that the JVP had protested against his proposal to introduce English education through the White Paper when he was the Minister of Education. He argued that if this program had been implemented at that time, the country would not be facing the English language issues it does today. President Wickremesinghe made these remarks yesterday (17th) following a meeting with the people of Malwana, in response to a question posed by a young person who inquired about what the government could do for youth struggling with English language skills. While outlining his vision of a brighter future for Generation Z, the President urged the youth not to be misled by the political schemes of Sajith and Anura, who he says have no vision and only fake plans. Replying to a query from a first-time voter and student, the President said they are striving for a brighter tomorrow. The rupee is gaining strength, and the economy is beginning to stabilize. He emphasized that its up to the younger generation to carve out the future they desire. My aim is to create a better tomorrow for all you amazing Gen Z individuals. Asked about the harassment faced by Muslim women wearing hijabs, niqabs, and abayas when entering offices and public places a few months ago, the President said: As long as I am President, you will not face such issues. If you wish to wear traditional attire, that is your choice. If not, that is also your decision. I understand the challenges you have faced. I was even criticized during a commission inquiry for stating that Muslim women should not be scrutinized or forced to remove their attire. Despite protests, I acknowledged the hardships you endured, especially with the forced cremations of your loved ones. Now, I have introduced a law allowing individuals to choose between cremation and burial, respecting their personal wishes, he added.",

He has also broken Michael Vandorts record for fastest Sri Lankan batter to reach 4 Tests hundreds, in just 11 innings, thus equaling Don Bradmans record. Mendis has joined an elite club, equalling a world Test record by becoming only the second batter to score 50-plus runs in each of his first seven Test matches. Pakistans Saud Shakeel is the only other cricketer to have achieved this remarkable feat. Mendis reached this milestone during the first day of the opening Test against New Zealand in Galle, scoring his eighth 50-plus in Tests. His achievement surpasses cricketing greats like Sunil Gavaskar (India), Saeed Ahmed (Pakistan), and Basil Butcher (West Indies), who all managed fifties in each of their first six Test matches. This record follows Kamindus impressive series against England, where he scored 113, 74, and 64 in a series of stellar performances. After making his Test debut in 2022 against Australia with a solid 61, Mendis was sidelined for nearly two years but returned in 2024 with back-to-back centuries in Bangladesh. In Galle, Mendis brought up his fifty off 73 balls and added a crucial 72-run partnership with Angelo Mathews. Sri Lanka were 2615 in the 1st innings a short while ago. --Agencies",

        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe announced that a crucial discussion between the Government of Sri Lanka and international sovereign bondholders will take place tomorrow (19). Following this meeting, Sri Lanka is expected to receive international support once the countrys bankruptcy is fully resolved, he said. The President also expressed his satisfaction, stating that he was entrusted with a task and he is pleased to report that the work entrusted to him has been successfully completed by September 21. He made these remarks during the Ranil Can election rally held at the Matara Uyanwatta Stadium earlier today (18). President Wickremesinghe highlighted that he successfully addressed the countrys economic crisis with the motto Puluwan Sri Lanka (Yes we Can) and emphasized that the current focus is on developing the nation under the same banner. He stressed the importance of electing a leader capable of leading the country forward. The President questioned why Sajith Premadasa and Anura Kumara Dissanayake did not take over the government two years ago if they had solutions to the economic problems. He claimed that Sajiths team had previously claimed that the countrys economy could not be rebuilt. In his address, President Wickremesinghe reiterated his commitment to guiding Sri Lanka toward economic recovery and development. Addressing the public rally, President Ranil Wickremesinghe further said: Our election campaign ends today. On September 21, the people of this country will make a decision about their future. I have lived my life as a politician, and as citizens, you have placed your trust in political leaders. Over the past two years, we have all had a new experienceleaders you relied on, failed to confront the nations problems and abandoned their responsibilities. I stepped in and took over a country in dire straits. As leaders, we must face challenges. There are moments of both joy and hardship. We hear praise and criticism alike. Our names become well-known, then forgotten. The political process brings both gains and losses, and we are forced to make tough decisions. Even when I was rejected by the people, I made the choice that I could not turn my back on them. As the leader of this country, I accepted the challenge and chose to stand by the people, not to abandon them. The ship I inherited had gaping holesit could have sunk like the Titanic. Water had already flooded in, and there was no captain. But we took control of the ship and began the journey together with everyone on board. I inherited a country unable to pay its debtsa bankrupt nation, with no foreign reserves. Our bondholders had lost faith in us. Yet, over the past two years, weve worked to rebuild, resolving these issues and restoring our debt sustainability. We reached agreements with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank, and the Asian Development Bank, which have allowed us to move beyond bankruptcy and begin to rebuild. We have also worked with countries that lent us money. Weve reached an agreement with 18 nations and have a separate understanding with China. Together, we have created a new framework to recognize our debt sustainability, demonstrate that we are no longer bankrupt, and move towards development. The final step is negotiating with the international sovereign bondholders, and tomorrows discussion will conclude that. Once this is done, Sri Lankas bankruptcy will be formally over, and we will receive much-needed support from other countries. I am proud to announce that, before the presidential election on September 21, the work I was entrusted with has been successfully completed. This gives me great satisfaction. Throughout this process, we have had to make difficult and unpopular decisions. There was no alternative. People faced hardships, but I worked to address and resolve those issues. Today, the rupee has strengthened, the prices of goods have gradually come down, and the people have received some relief. I am also committed to fully easing the cost of living by 2025. We must move the country forward and think about the next steps we need to take. Its crucial to solidify the economic stability weve worked hard to achieve. We faced the economic crisis with the belief that Sri Lanka can, and now, Puluwan Sri Lanka is focused on developing the country. I have already passed the necessary laws for this, including the Economic Transformation Act, which gives us the foundation to advance. Today, Sajith and Anura are talking about canceling the agreement with the International Monetary Fund. I ask them: do they really want to undo this progress and take us back to where we were two years ago? They have no real planswhat they seek is power. If they cancel the IMF agreement, it would have to be renegotiated, causing us to lose international trust, and we could find ourselves back in a time of shortages and long queues. However, if we continue on our current path, we have the chance to strengthen the rupee, ease the cost of living, and develop the nation. The people must decide whether to stay on a proven path or risk getting lost on an uncertain one. If Sajith and Anura had solutions, I ask, why didnt they step up two years ago when the country needed leadership? Should we entrust the country to those who ran away from responsibility? In this presidential election, its not about picking a team like you would for a cricket match. The team is chosen by Parliament. Some say they have a team, but I ask why that same group didnt rebuild the economy when they had the chance two years ago. In fact, it was that group who declared that they wouldnt take on the responsibility of leading the country. As we approach this election, its important for people to think about their future and the future of our youth. I am asking for your mandate to embark on a new journey. After tomorrows agreement with private bondholders, we will be ready to start that journey from the 22nd. By reducing the cost of living, creating jobs, and building a new economy, I aim to move this country forward with pride, without losing foreign exchange. On September 21, I ask for your vote for the gas cylinder to help us continue this progress.",

Israels spy agency Mossad, which has a long history of sophisticated operations on foreign soil, planted explosives inside pagers imported by Hezbollah months before Tuesdays detonations, a senior Lebanese security source and another source told news agency Reuters. This morning Lebanese Health Minister Firass Abiad confirmed that twelve people were killed and around 2,800 wounded in the incident. The minister, in a televised press conference, said the blasts killed twelve people, including a girl, adding that About 2,800 people were injured and more than 200 of them critically. The injuries were mostly on the face, hands and stomach, he had said. Irans state media had reported that its Ambassador to Lebanon, Mojtaba Amani, was also wounded in yesterdays pager incident. Hezbollah, which is banned both by the United States and the European Union is the political and military establishment in Lebanon and is backed by Iran. Hezbollah backs Hamas, which has been at war with Israel in Gaza since October 2023. Hezbollah had on Tuesday blamed Israel for the attack and has claimed that this is the biggest security breach it has faced yet. Just like the pagers, all the walkie-talkie devices also exploded at the same time, Hezbollah has claimed. Hezbollah had called the blasts an Israeli breach of its communications network, and has vowed to avenge the attack. Hezbollah also said it will continue to support Hamas in Gaza and that Israel should wait for a response for the massacre. Who made these devices? Initial reports suggested that the pagers were made by a Taiwanese company, but the firm has denied this. The Taiwanese pager manufacturer - Gold Apollo - said that the devices were made under a licence by a company called BAC, which is situated in Budapest, the capital city of Hungary. Though Israel has not commented on the blasts, it had said that it is widening the spectrum of its war with Hamas in Gaza to include its fight against its ally Hezbollah. Israel had made this statement hours before the blasts on Tuesday. Hezbollah response Calling it as a massacre and criminal aggression, Hezbollah said Israel is fully responsible for these attacks. Hezbollah, Irans most powerful proxy in the Middle East, said in a statement it would continue to support Hamas in Gaza and Israel should await a response to the pager massacre which left fighters and others bloodied, hospitalised or dead. Speaking further on the issue, Hezbollah said cross-border firing with Israeli forces have been ongoing and separate from the difficult reckoning that the criminal enemy must await for its massacre. --With agencies inputs",

        "date": "September 18, 2024 11:04 pm",
        "content": "Seven candidates contesting the 2024 Presidential Election were each given the opportunity to participate in a special Derana 360 program, according to the equal-ground policy followed by Ada Derana. Accordingly, Ada Derana had also invited the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) presidential candidate Sajith Premadasa. The seven special Derana 360 programs commenced airing from Thursday (Sept. 12). After informing SJB leader Sajith Premadasa of this, based on his advice a secretary managing his diary confirmed that the Derana 360 program could be conducted as a live recording and the date was also noted down in his diary as September 17. Following that, on several occasions the Derana News Director exchanged views with Mr. Premadasa over the phone related to this program while the the trailers related to the program also began airing from September 11. Meanwhile, advertisements announcing that Sajith Premadasa will participate in special program on September 17 were also published on newspapers. Ada Derana can responsibly state that on Sunday (September 15), the Derana News Director spoke with Lakshman Fonseka, a representative of Sajith Premadasa, about the recording of the program. During that conversation, at no point was it communicated that Mr. Sajith Premadasa would not be participating in the program or that the airing of the related trailers should be halted. However, in the morning of September 17, Mr. Sajith Premadasa informed the Derana News Director over the phone that he will not be able to participate in the Derana 360 program. Accordingly, TV Derana halted the airing of the trailers related to this program. Subsequently, as a responsible media channel TV Derana informed its viewers about this sudden change and quickly assigned the airtime originally designated for the Derana 360 program for the Wadapitiya program. However, despite all this, at 3.55 p.m. on September 17, the Media Secretary of the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB), Erananda Hettiarachchi, in a letter sent via WhatsApp, accused TV Derana of broadcasting the trailers for the program without the approval of Mr. Sajith Premadasa while claiming that he had not confirmed his participation in the program. However, the Derana News Director immediately sent a reply letter via WhatsApp to the Samagi Jana Balawegayas Media Secretary, Erananda Hettiarachchi, rejecting the allegation. However, in a press conference held today (18), the National Organiser of the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) MP Tissa Attanayake, stated a complaint would be filed with the Election Commission to conduct an investigation against TV Derana in relation to this incident. Derana would like emphasize that it stands ready to face any investigation if an investigation is conducted based on such a complaint made by MP Tissa Attanayake. Derana would also like to point out to MP Tissa Attanayake that Derana possess sufficient evidence confirming that Mr. Sajith Premadasa was aware of his participation in the special Derana 360 program on September 17. Derana would also like to remind MP Tissa Attanayake that the organization has not implemented any policy giving extra advantages to any presidential candidate during this entire election period, and urge him to compare this with other television channels and draw his own conclusions. In conclusion, Derana would like to express its disappointment and regret regarding the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) presidential candidate Sajith Premadasa not making use of the opportunity provided to him and for sending such irrational letters and making such allegations.",

Samaraweera is banned from holding any position within CA or a state or territory association, including any WBBL or BBL teams. CAs conduct commission found Samaraweera engaged in inappropriate behaviour while he was employed by Cricket Victoria (CV). CA and CV are committed to providing a safe environment for all players and employees and the welfare of those subjected to mistreatment is paramount, a CA statement read. CV also released a statement, saying it strongly supported CAs decision to ban Samaraweera, who had worked with the state womens program. It is our view that the conduct was utterly reprehensible and a betrayal of everything we stand for at Cricket Victoria, CV chief executive Nick Cummins said. The victim in this case has demonstrated incredible strength of character and courage in speaking up. She will continue to receive our ongoing support to allow her to achieve her goals on and off the field. Cummins added: From an organisation perspective, the safety and wellbeing of everyone at Cricket Victoria is paramount. We will not tolerate any behaviour which compromises that position, or our people, and will always support our culture of speaking up. Samaraweera was appointed head coach of the Victorian womens team in May but resigned later that month prior to commencing the role. He had previously served as acting head coach. Samaraweera had joined CV in 2008 as a specialist batting coach. He played seven Tests for Sri Lanka between 1993 and 1995 and appeared in five ODIs during his playing career.

        "date": "September 19, 2024 03:44 pm",
        "content": "At least 20 people have been killed and more than 450 wounded by a second wave of explosions from wireless communication devices in Lebanon, the countrys health ministry says. Walkie-talkies used by the armed group Hezbollah blew up in the southern suburbs of the capital Beirut, the Bekaa Valley, and southern Lebanon - areas seen as its strongholds. Some of the blasts took place during funerals for some of the 12 people who the ministry said were killed when Hezbollah members pagers exploded on Tuesday. Hezbollah blamed Israel for that attack. Israel has not commented. The attacks came as Israels Defence Minister Yoav Gallant announced a new phase in the war and as an Israeli army division was redeployed to the north. UN Secretary General Ant√≥nio Guterres warned of the serious risk of a dramatic escalation and called on all parties to exercise maximum restraint. Obviously the logic of making all these devices explode is to do it as a pre-emptive strike before a major military operation, he told reporters. There were already rising fears of an all-out conflict after 11 months of cross-border fighting sparked by the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza. Hours after Wednesdays explosions, Israels Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed to return the tens of thousands of displaced people from the north of the country securely to their homes. Defence Minister Yoav Gallant meanwhile said Israel was opening a new phase in the war and that the centre of gravity is shifting to the north through the diversion of resources and forces. An army division recently engaged in Gaza has been redeployed to the north, the Israeli military confirmed. Hezbollah says it is acting in support of Hamas - which is also backed by Iran and proscribed as a terrorist organisation by Israel and many Western countries - and will only stop its cross-border attacks once the fighting in Gaza ends. An indication of what the group might be planning to do next could come on Thursday, when its powerful leader, Hassan Nasrallah, is due to give a speech. Hezbollahs media office on Wednesday announced the death of 13 of its fighters, including a 16-year-old boy, since the second wave of explosions. It also said the group targeted Israeli forces near the border and in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights during the day, firing rockets at Israeli artillery positions. The Israeli military said about 30 projectiles crossed from Lebanon on Wednesday, sparking a fire but causing no injuries. It said Israeli aircraft struck Hezbollah fighters in southern Lebanon. Wednesdays deadly explosions represent another humiliation for Hezbollah and a possible indication that its entire communication network might have been infiltrated by Israel. Many Lebanese are still shocked - and angered - by what happened on Tuesday, when thousands of pagers exploded at the same time, after people received a message they believed had come from the group. Twelve people - including an eight-year-old girl and an 11-year-old boy - were killed and 2,800 others were wounded by the blasts, according to the Lebanese health minister. A BBC team was at a funeral for four of those killed in the southern Beirut suburb of Dahiya on Wednesday when they heard a loud explosion around 17:00 local time (14:00 GMT). There was chaos and confusion among the mourners, and then reports started to come in of explosions happening in other parts of the country as well. One unconfirmed social media video showed a man falling to the ground following a small blast during what appeared to be a Hezbollah procession attended by large crowds. The Lebanese Red Cross said more than 30 ambulances had responded to explosions in the capitals southern suburbs, as well as in southern Lebanon and the Bekaa Valley. The health ministry said the deadly explosions targeted walkie-talkies. A source close to Hezbollah also told AFP news agency that walkie-talkies used by its members had blown up. Lebanons state-run National News Agency (NNA) said one man was killed when a walkie-talkie exploded inside a shop selling cellular devices in Chaat, in the northern Bekaa Valley. It identified the device as an ICOM-V82 handheld VHF radio, which is a now-discontinued model made by the Japan-based electronics manufacturer ICOM. NNA said another ICOM-V82 exploded at a house on the outskirts of the nearby town of Baalbek. Video footage showed fire damage to a table and wall, as well as damaged parts of what appeared to be a walkie-talkie bearing the label ICOM. Reuters news agency cited a Lebanese security source as saying the walkie-talkies were purchased by Hezbollah five months ago - around the same time as the pagers were bought. The Axios news website cited two sources as saying that Israeli intelligence services had booby-trapped thousands of walkie-talkies before delivering them to Hezbollah as part of the groups war-time emergency communications system. The BBC asked ICOMs UK arm to comment on the reports, but it referred all media requests to the companys press office in Japan. The BBC has reached out to ICOM Japan. US and Lebanese sources told the New York Times and Reuters that Israel had planted small amounts of explosives inside the pagers which blew up on Tuesday. An ophthalmologist at one hospital in Beirut told the BBC that at least 60 of the people he had seen had lost at least one eye, with most also losing a hand. Probably this is the worst day of my life as a physician. I believe the number of casualties and the type of damage that has been done is humongous, Dr Elias Warrak said. Unfortunately, we were not able to save a lot of eyes, and unfortunately the damage is not limited to the eyes - some of them have damage in the brain in addition to any facial damage.

        "date": "September 19, 2024 04:18 pm",
        "content": "An artificial-intelligence advisory body at the United Nations on Thursday released its final report proposing seven recommendations to address AI-related risks and gaps in governance. The U.N. last year created a 39-member advisory body to address issues in the international governance of AI. The recommendations will be discussed during a U.N. summit held in September. The advisory body called for the establishment of a panel to provide impartial and reliable scientific knowledge about AI and address information asymmetries between AI labs and the rest of the world. Since the release of Microsoft-backed OpenAIs ChatGPT in 2022, the use of AI has spread rapidly, raising concerns about fueling misinformation, fake news and infringement of copyrighted material. Only a handful of countries have created laws to govern the spread of AI tools. The European Union has been ahead of the rest by passing a comprehensive AI Act compared with the United States approach of voluntary compliance while China has aimed to maintain social stability and state control. The United States was among about 60 countries that endorsed a blueprint for action to govern responsible use of AI in the military on Sept. 10, while China did not support the legally non-binding document. With the development of AI in the hands of a few multinational companies, there is a danger that the technology could be imposed on people without them having a say in how it is used, the U.N. said in a statement. It also recommended a new policy dialogue on AI governance, creating an AI standards exchange and a global AI capacity development network to boost governance capacities. Among other proposals, the U.N. wants a global AI fund to be established, which would address gaps in capacity and collaboration. It also advocates the formation of a global AI data framework to ensure transparency and accountability. Finally, the U.N. report proposed setting up a small AI office to support and coordinate the implementation of these proposals. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

The government held restricted discussions with nine members of the steering committee of the ad-hoc group of bondholders between September 12th and 18th, it said in a statement on Thursday. The parties agreed to introduce governance-linked bond features as part of the revised bond treatment, it said, referring to clauses that would cut Sri Lankas repayments if it meets certain governance and anti-corruption-related targets. Sri Lanka was joined by its legal and financial advisors, Clifford Chance LLP and Lazard, respectively, and the Restricted Members of the Steering Committee were joined by the Groups legal and financial advisors, White  Case LLP and Rothschild  Co, respectively, the statement said. The Steering Committee, as a whole, comprises ten of the largest members of the Group, with the Group controlling approximately 40 of the aggregate outstanding amount of the Bonds. Sri Lanka also announces today that in the last year it has held restricted discussions with members of the Local Consortium of Sri Lanka (LCSL), joined by its legal and financial advisors, Baker McKenzie and Newstate Partners LLP, respectively. The LCSL comprises 11 members, controlling approximately 12 of the aggregate outstanding amount of the Bonds. Meanwhile, the Government of Sri Lanka said it has reached agreements with external commercial creditors to restructure approximately USD 17.5 billion of external debt, achieving a 40.3 Net Present Value (NPV) concession. This provides significant debt relief and reduces interest payments, strengthening the countrys financial stability, according to the statement. It further said that Sri Lanka finalized a deal with China Development Bank to restructure USD 3.3 billion in debt. As a result of the debt treatment agreements with Exim Bank of China, Official Creditor Committee (OCC), China Development Bank (CDB) and bondholders, Sri Lanka will have obtained over USD 17 billion of debt service relief during the IMF program, the statement added. --With Agencies Inputs Read the full statement below... Sri Lanka Reaches Agreement In Principle With Each Of The Ad Hoc Group Of Bondholders, The Local Consortium Of Sri Lanka And China Development Bank On Debt Restructuring Terms The Government of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka (Sri Lanka) announces today that it has held restricted discussions between 12 September 2024 and 18 September 2024 (the Restricted Period) with nine members of the steering committee (the Steering Committee) of the Ad Hoc Group of Bondholders (the Group) who agreed to take part in such restricted discussions (the Restricted Members of the Steering Committee). Sri Lanka was joined by its legal and financial advisors, Clifford Chance LLP and Lazard, respectively, and the Restricted Members of the Steering Committee were joined by the Groups legal and financial advisors, White  Case LLP and Rothschild  Co, respectively. The Steering Committee, as a whole, comprises ten of the largest members of the Group, with the Group controlling approximately 40 of the aggregate outstanding amount of the Bonds. Sri Lanka also announces today that in the last year it has held restricted discussions with members of the Local Consortium of Sri Lanka (LCSL), joined by its legal and financial advisors, Baker McKenzie and Newstate Partners LLP, respectively. The LCSL comprises 11 members, controlling approximately 12 of the aggregate outstanding amount of the Bonds. During the discussions with the Restricted Members of the Steering Committee, the parties discussed the conclusions of the consultations carried out throughout the summer between Sri Lanka, its advisors, the Groups advisors, the International Monetary Fund (the IMF) and Sri Lankas Official Creditor Committee (the OCC), in respect of the joint working framework on a debt treatment agreed between Sri Lanka and the Restricted Members of the Steering Committee, on behalf of the Group, in June 2024 (as announced on 3 July 2024) (the JWF). During these consultations, IMF staff determined that the JWF was not consistent with the parameters of Sri Lankas IMF-supported Program and the OCC expressed concerns regarding the consistency of the JWF with the comparability of treatment principle (Comparability of Treatment). It became clear, during these consultations, that further work was necessary to arrive at an agreement in principle between the parties which would receive a favourable assessment from both IMF staff and the OCC. Following an iterative process with IMF staff at technical level and taking account of the feedback received from the OCC regarding the terms of the JWF, Sri Lanka and its advisors designed a revised debt treatment. The revised debt treatment was based on the JWF, with amendments designed to ensure compliance with the parameters of Sri Lankas IMF-supported Program and the Comparability of Treatment principle, while preserving the Groups and Sri Lankas interests to the fullest possible extent. The revised debt treatment was presented to and discussed with the Restricted Members of the Steering Committee, in conjunction with the terms of an alternative restructuring option (the Local Option), which was concurrently presented and discussed with the LCSL. The Local Option was developed in response to a request by the LCSL over a number of months in which Sri Lanka, its advisors, the LCSL and its advisors exchanged alternative proposals. At the conclusion of the Restricted Period, Sri Lanka is pleased to report that it has reached an agreement in principle with the Restricted Members of the Steering Committee, on behalf of the Group, on the terms of a comprehensive restructuring of the Bonds (the Agreement in Principle), the key financial terms of which are included in the Annex to this announcement. During the discussions with the Restricted Members of the Steering Committee during the Restricted Period, the parties thereto also discussed and agreed the inclusion of governance-linked bond features in the terms of the plain vanilla bond instrument that forms part of the revised debt treatment. At the same time, Sri Lanka is also pleased to report that it has reached an agreement in principle with the LCSL on the key financial terms of the Local Option, the key financial terms of which are also included in the Annex to this announcement. It has further been agreed that the Local Option would be offered to all holders of the Bonds, subject to a cap tentatively set at 25 of the aggregate outstanding amount of the Bonds, with priority given to local holders of the Bonds, and pro-rata allocation of the balance between consenting international holders of the Bonds who have opted for the Local Option. During the Restricted Period, Sri Lanka also progressed discussions and reached an agreement in principle with the Restricted Members of the Steering Committee on certain non-financial provisions relating to the restructuring of the Bonds, including a loss reinstatement provision, a most favoured creditor clause and certain ongoing information disclosure requirements. A mechanism to change the governing law of the New York law governed new securities to English or Delaware law with the consent of a supermajority of bondholders if proposed by holders of 20 of any particular series of the new securities was also agreed. In addition, Sri Lanka agreed with the Restricted Members of the Steering Committee and the LCSL on matters relating to the reimbursement of certain expenses of the Steering Committee and the LCSL. In respect of the Local Option, Sri Lanka and the LCSL have agreed the USD Bond (as defined in the Annex to this announcement) shall include a provision whereby Sri Lanka would have the option, at its sole discretion, to make debt service payments in LKR rather than USD, at the then prevailing exchange rate , if Sri Lanka is, in its determination, unable to make such debt service payments in USD on the contractual payment dates. Sri Lanka has agreed with the Restricted Members of the Steering Committee, on behalf of the Group, and the LCSL to proceed with the implementation of the restructuring of the Bonds on the basis of the Agreement in Principle and the Local Option. Having received informal confirmation from IMF staff during the Restricted Period, Sri Lanka now expects to receive formal confirmation from IMF staff that the Agreement in Principle and the Local Option, taken together, are fully consistent with the parameters of Sri Lankas IMF-supported Program. In parallel, Sri Lanka will continue to work with the OCC and its Secretariat to secure confirmation of compliance of the Agreement in Principle and the Local Option with the Comparability of Treatment principle. Upon receiving such confirmations, Sri Lanka commits to use its best efforts to expedite the implementation of the restructuring in respect of the Bonds. Finally, Sri Lanka is pleased to report having finalized agreement in principle with China Development Bank (CDB) on the key financial terms of the restructuring of approximately U.S.3.3bn of debt, based on an initial set of terms agreed in May 2024 following several months of good faith engagement. While the terms initially agreed in principle were confirmed to be compatible with Sri Lankas IMF-supported Program parameters, further consultations with the OCC over the summer were necessary in relation to the Comparability of Treatment principle. Following the finalization of this agreement in principle, Sri Lanka expects to receive formal confirmation from IMF staff and the OCC and to be able to move to documentation shortly thereafter. The agreements in principle with the Group, the LCSL and CDB, which were approved by the Cabinet of Ministers of Sri Lanka earlier today, almost completes Sri Lankas sovereign debt restructuring exercise, as agreed under Sri Lankas IMF-supported Program to restore debt sustainability. Sri Lanka would like to thank the Group and its advisors, the LCSL and its advisors, and CDB and its advisors, for their close collaboration and continuous support throughout the negotiations. The restructuring of the Bonds will be implemented through an exchange offer andor consent solicitation. Implementation of the restructuring of the Bonds remains subject to agreement between Sri Lanka, the Group and the LCSL on the definitive legal documentation for the new securities and exchange offer andor consent solicitation. The restructuring of the abovementioned debt with CDB remains subject to agreement between Sri Lanka and CDB on the definitive legal documentation.",

        "date": "September 19, 2024 05:22 pm",
        "content": "Nintendo and its partner The Pok√©mon Company have filed a legal case against the maker of the hit survival adventure game Palworld over alleged patent infringement. Palworld quickly earned the nickname Pok√©mon with guns when its first trailer was unveiled in 2021. Just days after the games release in January this year, The Pok√©mon Company said it would investigate the copycat claims. Palworlds developer, Pocketpair Inc, acknowledged the lawsuit in a statement on Thursday and apologised to fans for any worry or discomfort caused. Pocketpairs boss previously said the game had passed legal checks. Palworld infringes multiple patent rights, Nintendo and The Pok√©mon Company said in statements posted on their websites. This lawsuit seeks an injunction against infringement and compensation for damages. Palworld has become a major hit, with more than 25 million players within a month of its release. Like the popular franchise of Pok√©mon video games, it also centres around collecting strange creatures with different powers. Pocketpairs website describes the game as seamlessly integrating elements of battle, monster-capturing, training, and base building. Players, known as pal-tamers, travel around a large map battling human foes and creatures known as pals which can be captured and recruited. The monsters can either fight alongside the player in battles, or be put to work at a base, crafting supplies and items for use in the field. In January, The Pok√©mon Company said it planned to investigate claims that Palworld had copied its games, after fans pointed out similarities. The Pok√©mon Company said at the time it would take appropriate action if it found its copyright had been breached. Pocketpair said in its response to the lawsuit on Thursday it would begin taking action on and investigating The Pok√©mon Companys claims. But it added that it was unaware of the specific patents that it had been accused of infringing. We have not been notified of such details, it said. It added that it was truly unfortunate that it would need to allocate time and resources to the lawsuit, rather than game development - highlighting its status as a smaller, indie developer. However, we will do our utmost for our fans, and to ensure that indie game developers are not hindered or discouraged from pursuing their creative ideas, it said. Source: BBC --Agencies",

Human traffickers are actively targeting young IT professionals through fraudulent job offers abroad, it said issuing a statement today. Investigations reveal that traffickers are luring victims with promises of high-paying IT positions in countries like Thailand. However, unsuspecting individuals are taken to transit countries such as Dubai for supposed job interviews before being forcibly moved across borders. Many end up in Myanmar, where they are coerced into working at cyber scam centers under brutal conditions, including physical abuse, torture, and electrocution, it said. We strongly advise against illegal migration routes, the NAHTTF warned. Job seekers must avoid opportunities that require travel on visit visas, as this violates the Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment Act. The task force urges the public to pursue safe and legal migration options through authorized channels, remain vigilant, and report suspicious trafficking activities. Protecting vulnerable individuals from exploitation is a top priority.

        "title": "Hezbollah leader vows retaliation against Israel for attacks on devices as both sides trade strikes",
        "date": "September 19, 2024 10:14 pm",
        "content": "The leader of Hezbollah vowed to keep up daily strikes on Israel despite this weeks mass bombing attack on its communication devices, and said Israelis displaced by the fighting from homes near the Lebanon border would not be able to return until the war in Gaza ends. Hezbollah and Israel launched fresh attacks across the border as Hassan Nasrallah spoke for the first time since the deadly device bombings he described as a severe blow and for which he promised to retaliate. The two-days of attacks targeting thousands of Hezbollah pagers and walkie-talkies have been widely blamed on Israel, heightening fears that 11 months of near-daily exchanges of fire between Hezbollah and Israel will escalate into all-out war. During the speech, Hezbollah struck at least four times in northern Israel, and two Israeli soldiers were killed in a strike earlier on Thursday. Israeli warplanes flew low over Beirut while Nasrallah spoke and broke the sound barrier, scattering birds and prompting people in houses and offices to quickly open windows to prevent them from shattering. Israel also launched attacks in southern Lebanon on Thursday, though it was not immediately clear if there were any casualties. In recent weeks, Israeli leaders have stepped-up warnings of a potential larger military operation against Hezbollah, saying they are determined to stop the groups fire to allow tens of thousands of Israelis to return to homes near the border. The attack using electronic devices appeared to be the culmination of a monthslong operation by Israel to target as many Hezbollah members as possible all at once but civilians were also hit. At least 37 people were killed, including two children, and some 3,000 wounded in the explosions Tuesday and Wednesday. Nasrallah said the group is investigating how the bombings were carried out. Yes, we were subjected to a huge and severe blow, he said. The enemy crossed all boundaries and red lines, he said. Pointing to the number of pagers and walkie-talkies, he accused Israel of intending to kill thousands of people at one time. The enemy will face a severe and fair punishment from where they expect and dont expect. He said Hezbollah will continue its barrages into northern Israel as long as the war in Gaza continues, vowing that Israel will not be able to bring its people back to the border region. The only way is stop the aggression on the people of Gaza and the West Bank, he said. either strikes, nor assassinations nor an all-out war will achieve that. Earlier Thursday, Hezbollah said it had targeted three Israeli military positions near the border, two of them with drones. Israeli hospitals reported eight people lightly or moderately injured. Overnight, the miltiary said it struck several militant sites in southern Lebanon, Hezbollah says its near daily fire is a show of support for Hamas. Israels 11-month-old war with Hamas in Gaza began after its militants led the Oct. 7 attack on Israel. Israel has responded to Hezbollahs fire with strikes in southern Lebanon, and has struck senior figures from the group in the capital Beirut. The exchanges have killed hundreds in Lebanon and dozens in Israel and forced the evacuation of tens of thousands of residents on each side of the border. Israel and Hezbollah have repeatedly pulled back from an all-out war under heavy pressure from the United States, France and other countries. But in their recent warnings, Israeli leaders have said they are determined to change the status quo dramatically. Speaking to Israeli troops on Wednesday, Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said, We are at the start of a new phase in the war it requires courage, determination and perseverance. He made no mention of the exploding devices but praised the work of Israels army and security agencies, saying the results are very impressive. Gallant said that after months of fighting Hamas in Gaza, the center of gravity is shifting to the north by diverting resources and forces. Israel began moving more troops to its border with Lebanon on Wednesday as a precautionary measure, Israeli officials said. Israels army chief, Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi, said plans have been drawn up for additional action against Hezbollah, though media reported the government has not yet decided whether to launch a major offensive in Lebanon. Lebanon is still reeling from the deadly device attacks of Tuesday and Wednesday. The explosions have rattled anxious Lebanese fearing a full-scale war. The Lebanese Army said it has been locating and detonating suspicious pagers and communication devices, while the countrys civil aviation authorities banned pagers and walkie-talkies on all airplanes departing from Beiruts international airport until further notice. The attack was likely to severely disrupt Hezbollahs internal communication as it scrambles to determine safe means to talk to each other. Hezbollah announced the death of five combatants Thursday, but didnt specify if they were killed in the explosions or on the front lines. The blasts went off wherever the holders of the pagers or walkie-talkies happened to be in multiple parts of Beirut and eastern and southern Lebanon in homes and cars, grocery stores and cafes and on the street, even at a funeral for some killed in the bombings, often with family and other bystanders nearby. Many suffered gaping wounds on their legs, abdomens and faces or were maimed in the hand. Tuesdays pager blasts killed 12 people, including two children, and wounded some 2,300 others. The following days explosion killed 25 and wounded more than 600, Health Minister Firas Abiad said, giving updated figures. Abiad told reporters that Wednesdays injuries were more severe than the previous day as walkie-talkies that exploded were bigger than the pagers. He praised Lebanons hospitals, saying they had managed to deal with the flood of wounded within hours. It was an indiscriminate attack. It was a war crime, he said. Source: AP --Agencies",

        "title": "Israel unleashes heavy strikes on Lebanon as US, UK urge restraint",
        "date": "September 20, 2024 10:35 am",
        "content": "Israeli warplanes carried out late on Thursday their most intense strikes on southern Lebanon in nearly a year of war, heightening the conflict between Israel and Lebanese armed group Hezbollah amid calls for restraint. The White House said a diplomatic solution was achievable and urgent, and Britain called for an immediate ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah. The U.S. is afraid and concerned about potential escalation, White House spokesperson Karine Jean-Pierre told a briefing. The intense barrage followed attacks earlier in the week attributed by Lebanon and Hezbollah to Israel that blew up Hezbollah radios and pagers, killing 37 people and wounding about 3,000 in Lebanon. In Thursdays late operation, Israels military said its jets over two hours struck hundreds of multiple-rocket-launcher barrels in southern Lebanon that were set to be fired immediately toward Israel. The bombardment included more than 52 strikes across southern Lebanon after 9 p.m.(1800 GMT), Lebanons state news agency NNA said. Three Lebanese security sources said these were the heaviest aerial strikes since the conflict began in October. There were no immediate reports of casualties. Israels military vowed to continue to attack Hezbollah and said its strikes throughout Thursday hit about 100 rocket launchers plus other targets in southern Lebanon. In a TV address on Thursday, Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah said the device explosions on Tuesday and Wednesday crossed all red lines. The enemy went beyond all controls, laws and morals, he said, adding the attacks could be considered war crimes or a declaration of war. Israel has not directly commented on the pager and radio detonations, which security sources say were probably carried out by its Mossad spy agency, which has a long history of carrying out sophisticated attacks on foreign soil. The Lebanese mission to the U.N. said in a letter to the Security Council on Thursday that Israel was responsible for detonating the devices via electronic messages and explosives implanted in them before they arrived in Lebanon, in line with theories that have circulated since the explosions. The 15-member Security Council is due to meet on Friday over the blasts. Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati called on the Security Council to take a firm stand to stop Israels aggression and technological war. Israel vows Hezbollah to pay increasing price As Nasrallahs broadcast aired, deafening sonic booms from Israeli warplanes shook Beirut, a sound that has become common in recent months but has taken on greater significance as the threat of all-out war has ramped up. Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said late on Thursday that Israel will keep up military action against Hezbollah. In the new phase of the war there are significant opportunities but also significant risks. Hezbollah feels that it is being persecuted and the sequence of military actions will continue, Gallant said in a statement. Our goal is to ensure the safe return of Israels northern communities to their homes. As time goes by, Hezbollah will pay an increasing price, Gallant said. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu convened his close circle of ministers for consultations, Israels Channel 13 News reported. Two Israeli soldiers were killed in combat on Thursday in Israels north, the Israeli military said. Big harsh blow Hezbollah fired missiles at Israel the day after the Oct. 7 cross-border attack by the Palestinian militant group Hamas which triggered the Gaza war. Since then, constant exchanges of fire have occurred. Although neither side has allowed this to escalate into full-scale war, it has led to the evacuation of tens of thousands of people from the border area on both sides. Nasrallah said Hezbollah hoped Israeli troops would enter southern Lebanon because that would create a historic opportunity for the Iran-backed group. No military escalation, killing, assassinations or all-out war would return Israeli residents to the border area, he added. Israel will face a crushing response from the axis of resistance, Irans Revolutionary Guards Commander Hossein Salami told Nasrallah on Thursday, according to state media, referring to a coalition of Iran-aligned militant groups including Hezbollah, Yemens Houthis, Hamas and armed groups in Iraq and Syria. Speaking in Paris, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken urged restraint, adding he did not want to see escalatory actions by any party that make a Gaza-ceasefire deal more difficult. The attacks on Hezbollah communications equipment sowed fear across Lebanon, with people abandoning electronic devices for fear of carrying bombs in their pockets. Nasrallah said thousands of pagers had been targeted simultaneously, with some of the explosions happening in hospitals, pharmacies, markets, shops and streets busy with civilians, women and children. Israel says its conflict with Hezbollah, like its war in Gaza against Hamas, is part of a wider regional confrontation with Iran, which sponsors both groups as well as armed movements in Syria, Yemen and Iraq. Israel has been accused of assassinations including a blast in Tehran that killed the leader of Hamas and another in a Beirut suburb that killed a senior Hezbollah commander within hours of each other in July.

        "date": "September 20, 2024 07:12 pm",
        "content": "(Reuters) - Authorities in Taiwan and Bulgaria on Friday denied involvement in the supply chain of thousands of pagers that detonated on Tuesday in Lebanon in a deadly blow to Hezbollah. Tuesdays attack, and another on Wednesday involving exploding hand-held radios used by Hezbollah, together killed 37 people and wounded about 3,000 in Lebanon. How or when the pagers were weaponised and remotely detonated remains a public mystery and the hunt for answers has involved Taiwan, Bulgaria, Norway and Romania. Security sources said Israel was responsible for the pager explosions that raised the stakes in a growing conflict between the two sides. Israel has not directly commented on the attacks. Taiwan-based Gold Apollo said this week it did not manufacture the devices used in the attack, and that Hungary-based company BAC to which the pagers were traced had a licence to use its brand. The components are (mainly) low-end IC (integrated circuits) and batteries, Taiwans Economy Minister Kuo Jyh-huei told reporters. When pressed on whether the parts in the pagers that exploded were made in Taiwan, he said, I can say with certainty they were not made in Taiwan, adding the case is being investigated by judicial authorities. Taiwans Foreign Minister Lin Chia-lung, also speaking to reporters at parliament, answered no when asked if he had met with the de facto Israeli ambassador to express concern about the case. We are asking our missions abroad to raise their security awareness and will exchange relevant information with other countries. Bulgaria also became a focal point for investigations on Thursday after local media reported that Sofia-based Norta Global Ltd was involved in selling the pagers. But Bulgarias state security agency DANS said on Friday it had indisputably established that no pagers used in the Lebanon attack were imported to, exported from, or made in Bulgaria. It said neither Norta nor its Norwegian owner had traded, sold or bought the pagers within Bulgarias jurisdiction. TAIWAN PROBE As Taiwanese authorities look into any potential link between its sprawling global tech supply chains and the devices used in the attacks in Lebanon, Gold Apollos president and founder, Hsu Ching-kuang, was questioned by prosecutors late into the night on Thursday, then released. Another person also at the prosecutors office was Teresa Wu, the sole employee of a company called Apollo System, who did not speak to reporters as she left late on Thursday. Hsu said this week a person called Teresa had been one of his contacts for the deal with BAC. Photos posted to Gold Apollos official Facebook page showed Teresa Wu at a Singapore trade show in 2016 wearing a Gold Apollo lanyard. Reuters was unable to contact Wu for comment. A spokesperson for the Shilin District Prosecutors Office in Taipei told Reuters that it had questioned two people as witnesses and was given consent to conduct searches of their firms four locations in Taiwan as part of its investigation. Well seek to determine if there was any possible involvement of these Taiwanese companies as soon as possible, to ensure the safety of the country and its people, the spokesperson said. Iran-aligned Hezbollah has vowed to retaliate against Israel, which has not claimed responsibility for the detonations. The two sides have been engaged in cross-border warfare since conflict in Gaza erupted last October. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "date": "September 20, 2024 08:44 pm",
        "content": "Top Hezbollah commander Ibrahim Aqil was killed on Friday in an Israeli strike on Beiruts southern suburbs, two security sources told Reuters. One of the sources said he was killed alongside members of Hezbollahs elite Radwan unit as they were holding a meeting. An Israeli official confirmed that the Israeli military targeted Ibrahim Akil, a senior Hezbollah military official, in Fridays airstrike on Beirut. It wasnt immediately clear if Akil was killed in the Israeli strike on Beiruts southern suburbs that killed at least three people and wounded 17 others, according to Lebanese health officials. The Israeli official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was discussing a behind the scenes security matter. An official close to the Hezbollah militant group, also speaking on condition of anonymity because he wasnt authorized to brief the media, confirmed to The Associated Press that Akil was supposed to be in the building when it was targeted Friday. The official couldnt confirm if Akil was killed. Akil has served as the head of Hezbollahs elite Radwan Force and Jihad Council, the groups highest military body. The U.S. State Department has sanctioned Akil for his alleged role in carrying out the 1983 bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Beirut and that he had directed the taking of American and German hostages in Lebanon and held them there during the 1980s. Israeli strike on Beirut on Friday killed at least three people and wounded more than a dozen others, Lebanese health officials said, the first Israeli attack on Lebanons capital in months that came shortly after Hezbollah pounded northern Israel with 140 rockets. Israel announced the strike, but didnt immediately specify the target in Beiruts crowded southern suburbs, where Lebanons Hezbollah militant group holds sway. An Israeli officials Lebanons Health Ministry reported that at least three people were killed and 17 others wounded as local networks broadcast footage of wounded people being pulled from the ruins of a flattened building and ambulances rushing to the scene of the strike. The strike in Dahiyeh, just kilometers from downtown Beirut, hit during rush hour, as people were leaving work and students headed home from school. The escalation came as the region awaited the revenge promised by the militant groups leader, Hassan Nasrallah, for this weeks mass bombing attack on pagers and walkie-talkies belonging to Hezbollah members. Israels rare strike on the Beirut suburbs came after Hezbollah pounded Israel with 140 rockets, which the Israeli military said came in three waves targeting sites along the ravaged border with Lebanon. Following the attacks, the Israeli military said that it had struck areas across southern Lebanon targeting Hezbollah infrastructure, but didnt provide details of damage. Hezbollah said that its attacks had targeted several sites along the border with Katyusha rockets, including multiple air defense bases as well as the headquarters of an Israeli armored brigade they said theyd struck for the first time. The Israeli military said that 120 missiles were launched at areas of the Golan Heights, Safed and the Upper Galilee, some of which were intercepted. Fire crews were working to extinguish blazes caused by pieces of debris that fell to the ground in several areas, the military said. The military didnt say whether any missiles had hit targets or caused any casualties. Another 20 missiles were shot at the areas of Meron and Netua, and most fell in open areas, the military said, adding that no injuries were reported. Hezbollah said that the rockets were in retaliation for Israeli strikes on villages and homes in southern Lebanon, not two days of attacks widely blamed on Israel that set off explosives in thousands of Hezbollah pagers and walkie-talkies. On Thursday, Israel said its military had struck hundreds of rocket launcher barrels in southern Lebanon, saying that they were ready to be used in the immediate future to fire toward Israeli territory. The army also ordered residents in parts of the Golan Heights and northern Israel to avoid public gatherings, minimize movements and stay close to shelters in anticipation of the rocket fire that eventually came Friday. Hezbollah and Israel have exchanged near-daily fire since Oct. 8, a day after the Israel-Hamas wars opening salvo, but Fridays rocket barrages were heavier than normal. Nasrallah on Thursday vowed to keep up daily strikes on Israel despite this weeks deadly sabotage of its members communication devices, which he described as a severe blow. At least 20 were killed in the attacks and thousands were wounded when pagers, walkie-talkies and other devices exploded in Lebanon on Tuesday and Wednesday. The sophisticated attacks have heightened fears that the cross-border exchanges of fire will escalate into all-out war. Israel has neither confirmed nor denied involvement in the attacks. In recent days, Israel has moved a powerful fighting force up to the northern border, officials have escalated their rhetoric, and the countrys security Cabinet has designated the return of tens of thousands of displaced residents to their homes in northern Israel an official war goal. Fighting in Gaza has slowed, but casualties continue to rise. Overnight, Palestinian authorities said that 15 people were killed in multiple Israeli attacks in the Gaza Strip. Those included six people, including an unknown number of children, in an airstrike early Friday morning in Gaza City that hit a family home, Gazas Civil Defense said. Another person was killed in Gaza City when a strike hit a group of people on a street. Israel maintains that it only targets militants, and accuses Hamas and other armed groups of endangering civilians by operating in residential areas. The military, which rarely comments on individual strikes, had no immediate comment. Gazas Health Ministry says that more than 41,000 Palestinians have been killed in the territory since Hamas Oct. 7 attack. The ministry doesnt differentiate between fighters and civilians in its count, but says a little over half of those killed were women and children. Israel says it has killed more than 17,000 militants, without providing evidence. More than 95,000 people have also been wounded in Gaza since Oct. 7, the Health Ministry said. The war has caused vast destruction and displaced about 90 of Gazas population of 2.3 million. Source: Reuters AP --Agencies",

The teams have been deployed to; Central, Eastern, North Central, Northern, Northwestern, Sabaragamuwa, Southern, Uva and Western and will be observing pre-poll arrangements in the run up to election day. The teams will be present when voting begins at 7am, and will observe the process until the polls close at 4 pm. As is customary, they will then observe the counting of votes and the tabulation of results. Commonwealth Observer Group Chairperson, former President of Seychelles, HE Danny Faure, who is following the process from Colombo, has also been observing pre-poll arrangements and has scouted a number of polling stations to which he will return on election day. He will be at the St Thomas Prep School station to observe as the first votes are cast. We recognise the significance of this election because Sri Lankans have been given the first opportunity to vote since the Aragalaya movement in 2022. Our presence here demonstrates the Commonwealths commitment to democratic values and principles. We are here because democracy is one of the Commonwealths cornerstones, and the foundation for vibrant, healthy, and prosperous societies, and most importantly we are here for the People of Sri Lanka. This is the Commonwealths 200th election observation, and the sixth in Sri Lanka since 2005, demonstrating the Commonwealths systematic effort to strengthen the process, culture, and institutions of democracy across its member countries, he said. 13,421 polling centres have been set up across the country forover 17 million registered voters and they will choose among 38 presidential candidates, including the incumbent, Mr. Ranil Wickremesinghe. The 38 presidential candidates represent the largest ever such pool in the history of the country. Sri Lanka is preparing for its presidential election on September 21, with over 17 million citizens, including first-time voter Dilushi, set to participate. She believes the Commonwealths presence is crucial. The election also coincides with International Peace Day, emphasising the importance of peaceful voting. Of the registered voters, more than 700 thousand Sri Lankans qualify for advance voting - referred to as postal voting, the purpose of which is to allow eligible voters who cannot vote in person on election day to cast their ballots. The Commonwealth Observer Group support team, already on the ground in Colombo, witnessed the opening and closing of advance voting in the run-up to election day. The President of Sri Lanka is elected using a preferential voting system, whereby voters can rank up to three candidates in order of preference. If no candidate receives more than 50 per cent of the total valid votes in the first count, all candidates except the top two are eliminated, and the candidate with the most overall votes in the second round of counting is then declared the winner. Following its observations, the Commonwealth Observer Group will share its findings through a preliminary statement on 23 September, 2024, the statement added.",

        "title": "Presidential Poll 2024: Sri Lanka to vote today in crucial election",
        "date": "September 21, 2024 06:30 am",
        "content": "Over 17 million Sri Lankans will have the chance to vote for the countrys next president today (September 21) in a crucial presidential election, the first major poll to be held after Sri Lankas worst economic crisis in 2022. A record-breaking 38 candidates are contesting this years election, the highest number of presidential candidates in the countrys history. A total of 17,140,354 Sri Lankans are eligible to vote, with the Gampaha District registering the highest number of voters with 1,881,129. Colombo District is second with 1,765,351 registered voters, and Kurunegala District has 1,417,226 voters. The Northern Province has a combined total of 899,268 registered voters. Voting will take place at 13,421 polling stations across the island from 7:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. today (21). Eligible voters are required to carry one of nine accepted forms of identification to cast their vote: 1. National Identity Card (NIC) 2. Valid Passport 3. Valid Driving License 4. Public Service Retirement ID 5. Elders Identity Card 6. ID Cards provided to clergy 7. Confirmation letter of NIC information 8. Temporary ID card issued by the Election Commission for disabled persons 9. Temporary ID card issued by the Election Commission for others The Commissioner General of Elections, Saman Sri Ratnayake explaining how the vote should be marked said: If someone wants to use their vote, they can use the X mark to cast their votes. Similar to previous elections, the X mark will be accepted by the Election commission. In addition, the Arabic numeral 1 is also valid for marking the vote, he added. Saman Sri Rathnayake further stated that for those wishing to indicate preferences, they can mark their first choice with the Arabic numeral 1 and their second choice with the Arabic numeral 2. To express all three preferences, voters must use Arabic numerals 1, 2, and 3 and any other markings will be considered invalid, he said. He further emphasized that mobile phones are prohibited inside polling stations. The process of transporting ballot boxes from the counting centers to polling stations had commenced last morning under tight security. Similar operations were observed across all 22 electoral districts, with activities proceeding rapidly in preparation for tomorrows election. Domestic and international observers will be present to monitor the voting process. A total of 63,000 police officers have been deployed to ensure security throughout the election. Additionally, the Election Commission has announced guidelines regarding leave for public and private sector employees to allow them to vote. The guidelines are as follows:  Half-day leave if the polling station is within 40 km of the workplace.  One days leave if the distance is between 40 and 100 km.  One and a half days leave for distances between 100 and 150 km.  Two days leave for distances exceeding 150 km. Large numbers of voters were seen gathering at Colombo Central Bus Station, Private Bus Station, Fort Railway Station, and Makumbura Multimodal Transport Center since yesterday, preparing to travel to their respective hometowns to cast their votes. A large number of international election observers including from the European Union (EU) and Commonwealth observers, working across various teams, have also reported to their posts across all nine provinces in Sri Lanka, ahead of the countrys presidential election. 13,421 polling centres have been set up across the country for over 17 million registered voters and they will choose among 38 presidential candidates, the largest ever such pool in the history of the country. Of the registered voters, more than 700 thousand qualify for advance voting - referred to as postal voting, the purpose of which is to allow eligible voters who cannot vote in person on election day to cast their ballots. The President of Sri Lanka is elected using a preferential voting system, whereby voters can rank up to three candidates in order of preference. If no candidate receives more than 50 per cent of the total valid votes in the first count, all candidates except the top two are eliminated, and the candidate with the most overall votes in the second round of counting is then declared the winner. If no candidate gets 50 percent plus one vote in the polls, the Election Commission will invoke the legal provision for a run-off between the two front-runners. The winning candidate is likely to take oath by Sunday evening or Monday and later form the cabinet of ministers. The election also coincides with International Peace Day, emphasising the importance of peaceful voting. The election assumes enormous significance since this is the first time that Sri Lankans will head to polling stations after the Araghalya protest movement in 2022 following the economic crisis that saw inflation soaring and the countrys foreign exchange dwindling to a record low. Then President Gotabaya Rajapaksa and Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa resigned following a popular uprising against them leading to incumbent Ranil Wickremesinghe getting elected as the president. Sri Lankas unprecedented crisis manifested in acute shortages of essentials and long lines for fuel and gas. Inflation soared to 70, the rupee depreciated 45 and the economy shrank by 7.3, forcing the government to seek a International Monetary Fund bailout. Aided by a bailout package from the IMF and Indian assistance have brought down the inflation and prices of essential commodities, but economic issues continue to dominate the minds of the voters. Although inflation cooled to 0.5 last month and GDP is forecast to grow 3 in 2024, for the first time in three years, the change is slow and yet to trickle down. However, Sri Lankas voters will get to opportunity to choose among a record 38 candidates in fray though the contest is likely to narrow down between incumbent President and independent candidate Ranil Wickremasinghe, Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa of the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB), and National People Powers (NPP) Anura Kumara Dissanayake. This three-way contest is unprecedented in Sri Lankan presidential elections, marking a historic moment with all candidates previously experiencing setbacks in the parliamentary polls. A good voter turnout is expected, in line with Sri Lankas record of high voter participation in every national election. The last presidential poll in 2019 saw a voter turnout of 83.72 per cent. Widely considered a watershed election for the citizens of the island, it will not only elect the ninth Executive President but also a leader who they think will continue to steer the country out of its unprecedented economic crisis. --With Agencies Inputs",

        "title": "Top Hezbollah commander among 14 killed in Israeli strike on Beirut",
        "date": "September 21, 2024 09:48 am",
        "content": "Israel killed a top Hezbollah commander and other senior figures in the Lebanese movement in an airstrike on Beirut on Friday, vowing to press on with a new military campaign until it is able to secure the area around the Lebanese border. The Israeli military and a security source in Lebanon said Ibrahim Aqil had been killed with other senior members of an elite Hezbollah unit in the airstrike, sharply escalating the year-long conflict between Israel and the Iran-backed group. Hezbollah confirmed Aqils death in a statement just after midnight that called him one of its top leaders, without providing details of how he died. In a later statement summarising Aqils biography, Hezbollah said he was killed in Beiruts southern suburbs of Dahiyeh in what it called a treacherous Israeli assassination. Lebanons health ministry said at least 14 people died in the strike and the toll was expected to climb as rescue teams worked through the night. It was not immediately known whether the toll included Aqil and other Hezbollah commanders. Earlier, the ministry said at least 66 people were injured, nine of whom were in critical condition. A second security source said at least six other Hezbollah commanders died when multiple missiles slammed into the opening of a buildings garage. The explosion tore into the buildings lower levels as Aqil met other commanders inside. Witnesses reported hearing a loud whistling and several consecutive blasts at the time of the strike. In a brief statement carried by Israeli media, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israels goals were clear and its actions spoke for themselves. Defence Minister Yoav Gallant, who said this week that Israel is launching a new phase of war on the northern border, posted on X: The sequence of actions in the new phase will continue until our goal is achieved: the safe return of the residents of the north to their homes. Tens of thousands of people have been evacuated from homes on both sides of the Israel-Lebanon border since Hezbollah began rocketing Israel in October in sympathy with Palestinians in the nearly year-old Israeli war against Hamas in Gaza. Israel, which last fought an all-out war against Hezbollah 18 years ago, has said it will use force if necessary to ensure its citizens can return to northern Israel. The Israeli military described Aqil as the acting commander of the Radwan special forces unit, and said it had killed him along with around 10 other senior commanders as they met. Aqil sat on Hezbollahs top military council, sources in Lebanon told Reuters. The strike inflicted another blow on Hezbollah after two days of attacks in which pagers and walkie-talkies used by its members exploded, killing 37 people and wounding thousands. Those attacks were widely believed to have been carried out by Israel, which has neither confirmed nor denied its involvement. Local broadcasters showed groups of people gathered near the site, and reported they were searching for missing people, most of them children. Drones were still flying over Beiruts southern suburbs hours after the strike. We are not afraid, but we want a solution. We cannot continue with the country like this, said Alain Feghali, a resident of Beirut who spoke to Reuters. War? I dont know if it started or not, but nothing is reassuring. It is clear that the two sides will not stop. The U.N. Special Coordinator for Lebanon, Jeanine-Hennis Plasschaert, said Fridays strike in a densely populated area of Beiruts southern suburbs was part of an extremely dangerous cycle of violence with devastating consequences. This must stop now. The strike marked the second time in less than two months that Israel has targeted a leading Hezbollah military commander in Beirut. In July, an Israeli airstrike killed Fuad Shukr, the groups top military commander. Aqil had a 7-million bounty on his head from the United States over his link to the deadly bombing of Marines in Lebanon in 1983, according to the U.S. State Department website. The Israeli military said Aqil had been head of Hezbollah operations since 2004 and was responsible for a plan to launch a raid on northern Israel, similar to the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7 that triggered the war in Gaza. The Hezbollah commanders we eliminated today had been planning their October 7th on the northern border for years, Israeli army chief General Herzi Halevi said. We reached them, and we will reach anyone who threatens the security of Israels citizens. Rubble and Burnt-Out Cars The Israeli military reported warning sirens in northern Israel following the Beirut strike, and Israeli media reported heavy rocket fire there. Hezbollah said it twice fired Katyusha rockets at what it described as the main intelligence headquarters in northern Israel which is responsible for assassinations. White House national security spokesperson John Kirby said he was not aware of any Israeli notification to the United States before the Beirut strike, adding Americans were strongly urged not to travel to Lebanon, or to leave if they were there. However he added that, war is not inevitable ... and were going to continue to do everything we can to try to prevent it. The current conflict between Israel and Hezbollah, ignited by the Gaza war, has intensified significantly this week. On Thursday night, the Israeli military carried out its most intensive airstrikes in southern Lebanon since the conflict erupted almost a year ago. The conflict between Israel and Hezbollah is the worst since they fought a war in 2006. Tens of thousands of people have had to leave homes on both sides of the border. While the conflict has largely been contained to areas at or near the frontier, this weeks escalation has heightened concerns that it could widen and further intensify. Source: Reuters --Agencies",
