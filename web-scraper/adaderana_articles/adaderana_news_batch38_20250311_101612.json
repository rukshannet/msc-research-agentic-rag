This decision is part of our ongoing efforts to restore normalcy in the economy and meet the needs of our people, the minister had said in a post on X (formerly Twitter). The government of Sri Lanka had decided to suspend vehicle imports in 2021 due to the economic crisis triggered by the Covid-19 pandemic.

Meanwhile, in June, the Ministry of Finance had announced a plan to gradually lift the restrictions by 2025.",

        "title": "Pope slams both Harris and Trump as against life and urges Catholics to vote for lesser evil",
        "date": "September 14, 2024 08:43 am",
        "content": "Pope Francis on Friday slammed both U.S. presidential candidates for what he called antilife policies on abortion and migration, and he advised American Catholics to choose who they think is the lesser evil in the upcoming U.S. elections. Both are against life, be it the one who kicks out migrants, or be it the one who kills babies, Francis said. The Argentine Jesuit was asked to provide counsel to American Catholic voters during an airborne news conference while he flew back to Rome from his four nation tour through Asia. Francis stressed that he is not an American and would not be voting. Neither Republican candidate Donald Trump nor the Democratic candidate, Kamala Harris, was mentioned by name. But Francis nevertheless expressed himself in stark terms when asked to weigh in on their positions on two hot button issues in the U.S. election abortion and migration that are also of major concern to the Catholic Church. Francis has made the plight of migrants a priority of his pontificates and speaks out emphatically and frequently about it. While strongly upholding church teaching forbidding abortion, Francis has not emphasized church doctrine as much as his predecessors. Francis said migration is a right described in Scripture and that anyone who does not follow the Biblical call to welcome the stranger is committing a grave sin. He was also blunt in speaking about abortion. To have an abortion is to kill a human being. You may like the word or not, but its killing, he said. We have to see this clearly. Asked what voters should do at the polls, Francis recalled the civic duty to vote. One should vote, and choose the lesser evil, he said. Who is the lesser evil, the woman or man? I dont know. Everyone in their conscience should think and do it, he said. The Harris and Trump campaigns did not immediately respond to requests for comment from The Associated Press. U.S. President Joe Biden, an observant Catholic, shares Harris strong support for abortion rights, a stance that prompted some Catholic bishops and other conservatives to call for him to be denied access to Communion. After meeting Francis in person at the Vatican in October 2021, Biden came away saying the pope told him he was a good Catholic and should continue receiving Communion. Francis, asked on previous occasions about some U.S. bishops who want to deny Communion to Biden over his support for abortion rights, has said bishops should be pastors, not politicians. Fridays news conference was not the first time Francis has weighed in on a U.S. election. In the run up to the 2016 election, Francis was asked about Trumps plan to build a wall at the U.S.Mexico border. Francis declared then that anyone who builds a wall to keep out migrants is not Christian. In responding Friday, Francis recalled that he celebrated Mass at the U.S.Mexico border and there were so many shoes of the migrants who ended up badly there. Trump pledges massive deportations, just as he did in his first White House bid, when there was a vast gulf between his ambitions and the legal, financial and political realities of such an undertaking. The U.S. bishops conference, for its part, has called abortion the preeminent priority for American Catholics in its published voter advice. Harris has strongly defended abortion rights and has emphasized support for reinstating a federal right to abortion. In his comments, the pope added: On abortion, science says that a month from conception, all the organs of a human being are already there, all of them. Performing an abortion is killing a human being. Whether you like the word or not, this is killing. You cant say the church is closed because it does not allow abortion. The church does not allow abortion because its killing. It is murder. However, cells are only beginning the process of developing into organs in the earliest weeks of pregnancy. For example, cardiac tissue starts to form in the first two months initially a tube that only later evolves into the four chambers that define a heart. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists says that by 13 weeks, all major organs have formed. In other comments, Francis: Denied a French media report that he would travel to Paris for the December inauguration of the restored Notre Dame Cathedral, saying flat-out he would not be there. But he confirmed he would like to go to the Canary Islands to highlight the plight of migrants. Tamped down renewed speculation that he might finally return to Argentina later this year, saying he wants to go but that nothing had been decided. He added: There are various things to resolve first. Francis has not been home since before the 2013 conclave that elected him pope. Declared that China was a promise and a hope for the Catholic Church and hoped to one day visit. Called sexual abuse demonic and weighed on the latest revelations of assault against a legendary French priest, Abbe Pierre. Source: AP --Agencies",

        "date": "September 14, 2024 09:42 am",
        "content": "The World Health Organization said Friday it has granted its first authorization for use of a vaccine against mpox in adults, calling it an important step toward fighting the disease in Africa. The approval of the vaccine made by Bavarian Nordic AS means that donors like vaccines alliance Gavi and UNICEF can buy it. But supplies are limited because theres only a single manufacturer. This first (authorization) of a vaccine against mpox is an important step in our fight against the disease, both in the context of the current outbreaks in Africa, and in future, said WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. WHO also said it was creating an access and allocation mechanism to try to fairly distribute mpox tests, treatments and vaccines to the countries who need them most. The U.N. health agency approved the two-dose mpox vaccine for people aged 18 and above. WHO said that while it was not recommending the vaccine for those under 18, the shot may be used in infants, children and adolescents in outbreak settings where the benefits of vaccination outweigh the potential risks. WHO recommended that a single dose of the shot could be used to stretch supplies, but emphasized the need to collect more data on how effective the vaccine might be as a single shot. The mpox vaccine made by Bavarian Nordic was previously authorized by numerous rich countries across Europe and North America during the global mpox outbreak in 2022. Millions of doses given to adults showed the vaccine helped slow the virus spread, but there is limited evidence of how it works in children. Officials at the Africa Center for Disease Control and Prevention said last month that nearly 70 of cases in Congo the country hardest hit by mpox are in children younger than 15, who also accounted for 85 of deaths. Overall, WHO said over 120 countries have confirmed more than 103,000 cases of mpox since the outbreak began two years ago. Its latest tally, as of Sunday, showed that 723 people in more than a dozen countries in Africa have died of the disease. African experts have estimated they might need about 10 million vaccines to stop the ongoing outbreaks on the continent while donor countries have promised to provide about 3.6 million vaccines. As of last week, Congo had received only about 250,000 doses. On Thursday, the Africa CDC said 107 new deaths and 3,160 new cases had been recorded in the past week, just a week after it and WHO launched a continent-wide response plan. Mpox belongs to the same family of viruses as smallpox but causes milder symptoms like fever, chills and body aches. People with more serious cases can develop lesions on the face, hands, chest and genitals. Source: AP --Agencies",

Addressing a public rally held in Kaduruwela, Jayaweera emphasized the urgent need to address the ongoing struggles faced by farmers. He criticized the current system, which he claims benefits only a small segment of the population while leaving farmers to grapple with persistent hardships. Nearly 30 percent of our population is directly involved in agriculture, yet they continue to face severe challenges, Jayaweera stated. It is unjust that while only a few benefit, the majority of our farmers suffer. Our goal is to transition these farmers to a more lucrative model, enhancing their income while keeping them within the agricultural sector. Jayaweera outlined his strategic plan, stating We have identified that the existing guaranteed price for crops is inadequate and needs to be revised. The government must regulate the market in a way that supports agriculture. Currently, the guaranteed price fails to address the economic realities of farmers, leaving them in debt and struggling to prepare for the next season. He questioned the viability of the current system, asking whether it is feasible for farmers to sell a kilo of paddy at the set price and still manage their expenses and preparations for future crops without falling further into financial difficulty. To remedy this, we must move away from the flawed concept of the guaranteed price and develop a fair agricultural system, Jayaweera said, adding that farmers deserve income that reflects their hard work, innovation, and dedication.",

        "date": "September 14, 2024 11:37 am",
        "content": "The departing head of the ICC Anti Corruption Unit (ACU), Alex Marshall, believes that elite cricket is largely free from corruption, but he cautions that those seeking to manipulate the sport are targeting entry through local T20 leagues that are not under the jurisdiction of the global governing body and are instead managed by the respective boards of member nations. Marshall, a former British police officer, did not specify which local leagues or member nations he was alluding to. I am confident that the cricket you watch is safe and clean, Marshall told ESPN Cricinfo as per PTI. But I am also absolutely sure that corruptors are constantly looking for a route into the game, particularly in badly-run lower-level franchise leagues. The threat to the game is corruptors wont go away while there is always money to be made and they will look for weakness in the system to get in. he added. Marshall expressed satisfaction with the increasing number of players reporting corrupt approaches to the ICC ACU, which helps maintain the integrity of the sport. However, he emphasized that the threat posed by corruptors will persist as long as there is money to be made, and they will seek out vulnerabilities in the system to gain access. Alex Marshall, during his seven-year tenure at the ICC, oversaw several significant achievements within the ICC ACU. Under his leadership, the organization ensured that former Bangladesh captain Shakib Al Hasan faced consequences for failing to report a corrupt approach by Indian bookie Deepak Aggarwal. Additionally, the late former Zimbabwe skipper Heath Streak was also punished for his involvement in corrupt activities. One of Marshalls most satisfying accomplishments was the successful eradication of corruption from Sri Lankan cricket. In collaboration with local authorities, multiple cases involving former international and domestic players engaged in alleged shady dealings were investigated and addressed. Sri Lanka turned out to be a good news story because there were serious issues which were addressed locally and with ICC, he said. Now with the legislation and stronger measures Sri Lanka is in a much better place to keep the corruptors away. Marshall said that he is happy to find that more and more players are reporting corrupt approaches with the ICC ACU, ensuring them to keep the game clean. I am proud of the significant increase in trust from players who now report approaches to us frequently whereas there was a time when they lacked confidence in confidentiality and the action that will be taken, Marshall said. They have now seen corruptors being disrupted, named, banned when they get involved in cricket. And the education we now do with players shows them who the corruptors are, what their methods are, so everyone is much better equipped and protected to keep corruption away from the game. The efforts made by Marshall and his team at the ICC ACU have contributed significantly to maintaining the integrity of the sport and protecting it from the influence of corrupt elements. His dedication to this cause has helped create a more transparent and fair environment for cricket players and enthusiasts worldwide. Source: Times of India --Agencies",

        "content": "Independent presidential candidate and incumbent President Ranil Wickremesinghe outlined a transformative vision for Sri Lankas future, focusing on modernizing the economy, empowering women, and implementing social justice reforms. Addressing the Womens Forum A programme for Progress at the Galle Face Hotel yesterday (13), he emphasized the need to move beyond the out-dated political systems and embrace a more export-driven, digital, and green economy, while also addressing critical social issues like gender equality and overcoming class and caste bias. Speaking to entrepreneurs and small business owners, he laid out a framework for significant changes, promising a focus on womens empowerment, social justice, and opportunities in a revamped economy. He urged the public to support his initiatives in the upcoming vote, symbolized by the gas cylinder on September 21. Addressing the forum President Wickremesinghe also stated; Its an interesting time, certainly listening to your concerns, which also showed me that many of you are involved in self-employment, as well as in small and mediumsized enterprises. Thats good. Now we have to see how we can encourage you to move forward after resolving the issues that have arisen from the recent economic crisis. The economic and political crises that followed, due to the inability of any leaders to assume responsibility for governing the country, showed a complete breakdown. We now need to put the social structures back in place. We have to think differently; dont assume we can rely on the old system. Thats the difference between me and the other candidatesthey want to restore the old system, but you cant. Economically, we will move towards an export-oriented economy, a digital economy, a green economy, with an emphasis on modernizing agriculture and increasing self-employment. These changes will also create opportunities for women to participate, he added. On the social side, we will focus on two major areas. First is womens empowerment, starting with the Womens Empowerment Act. We will also introduce the Gender Equality Bill, which aims to ensure equality between men and women, and nothing more. It will ensure that people of all genders are treated equally by the government. I am still committed to ensuring justice for women in how both male and female genders are addressed. Regarding womens empowerment and equality, the key question is: How do we expand these, and what roles are we going to play? We must not only talk about women in politics, but also about women in business and management. What is the ratio? In Sri Lanka, we still havent established the necessary gender ratios. The second focus will be the establishment of a Social Justice Commission. This will be another law to promote social justice. We need to overcome the existing biases based on class, caste, and other issues, Wickremesinghe highlighted.",

        "date": "September 14, 2024 12:54 pm",
        "content": "The Maldives hopes of staving off a debt crisis were given a lift on Friday after China agreed to strengthen trade and investment in its latest demonstration of support and influence in the Indian Ocean nation. Concerns have grown in recent months that the cash-strapped Maldives could become the first country to default on Islamic sovereign debt but this week has seen a sudden improvement in sentiment. A sharp rebound in its only international market bond - a sharia-compliant sukuk issue - was capped on Friday as Chinas central bank, the Peoples Bank of China (PBOC) and the Maldivian Ministry of Economic Development and Trade announced a memorandum of understanding. Though the details were limited, the two sides said it was a framework for cooperation aimed at promoting the settlement of current account transactions and direct investments in local currencies, as well as facilitating smoother trade. The signing of the MoU is the latest example of the Maldives reorientation towards China and away from India, traditionally the archipelago nations closest regional economic and security partner. In April, Maldives voters handed President Mohamed Muizzus party a landslide win in a parliamentary election. Muizzu, who took over as president in November, then held talks with Chinas President Xi Jinping in Beijing in January. Chinas foreign ministry earlier in the day had said the worlds second-largest economy and biggest bilateral lender had been in touch with the Maldives about its debt to Beijing and stepping up financial cooperation between the two countries. China will, as always, provide support and assistance to the economic and social development of the Maldives within its capability, Mao Ning, a Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson, told a regular press conference in Beijing prior to the announcement. It saw the Maldives sovereign sukuk bond extend its swift rebound. It added a hefty 4.2 cents on the day to reach almost 79 cents on the dollar, having started the month at a record low of 68 cents. WARNINGS Analysts warn it is not out of the woods yet though. Moodys this week became the latest rating agency to warn a default was looking increasingly likely, highlighting that the countrys reserves remain significantly below the 600 million to 700 million worth of debt payments the Maldives has coming due next year and the more than a billion dollars it has to make in 2026. The countrys central bank responded by vowing it would not default and that the country would make a 25 million payment on its Islamic sovereign debt next month on time and in full. Much of the money the Maldives owes is to regional rivals China and India though, which have extended 1.37 billion and 124 million in loans, respectively, World Bank Data shows. Tina Vandersteel, head of GMOs Emerging Country Debt team, an investment fund with a specialism in distressed debt, said exactly how much the Maldives owes remained murky while its U.S. dollar-pegged rufiyaa currency was a potential problem too. If the peg goes and then you have the typical 30 depreciation, debt-to-GDP - which is already 120 - would go even higher, she said. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "title": "Teachers bring Chinese language to remote Sri Lankan homes",
        "date": "September 14, 2024 02:23 pm",
        "content": "Voices reading Chinese are often heard on the serene hilly campus of Sabaragamuwa University nestled in the southern foothills of Sri Lankas central mountains. Stationed here are three teachers from China, teaching at a Confucius Classroom established in 2019 by Chinas Huanggang Normal University and Sabaragamuwa University of Sri Lanka. Life here comes with many inconveniences. Mosquitoes swarm the teachers dormitories which often have scary visitors like snakes and rats. Water, electricity, and internet cuts lasting seven or eight days during the rainy season are common. Fresh vegetables and daily essentials can only be bought at the farmers market that is held once a week, and the nearest supermarket requires nearly an hours drive on mountain roads. Despite all these, Zhu Song, the director of this classroom, who has persevered here for over three years, remains optimistic. I have survived the most difficult challenges. I feel quite content with life now, she says. The other two women, Zhang Huan and Xia Zihan, share a positive and optimistic understanding of their profession as overseas Chinese teachers. Rather than defining ourselves through sacrifice and dedication, we prefer to inspire children with positivity, friendliness, and vitality, igniting their enthusiasm for learning Chinese and their love for China. They have tailored Chinese textbooks to suit the students levels. To foster students interest in Chinese culture, they have introduced various traditional Chinese art forms. Additionally, this classroom helped set up a Chinese teaching branch at Bandarawela Central College in the nearby Uva province, and they regularly train local Chinese teachers there. The enthusiasm for learning Chinese is gradually spreading here. Xia mentions that there are two weekly Chinese courses for faculty members at the Confucius Classroom, currently attracting nearly 20 persons. This year, we had a Chinese food festival, featuring homemade dumplings and tanghulu (candied fruits). Over 400 villagers from the nearby areas took part in the festival. When teaching them how to say hello thank you and dumpling, I felt like I was a Chinese teacher too, says Dulani Weerakoon, a student majoring in Chinese here. Rohan Abeywickrama, dean of the faculty of Social Sciences and Languages at the University of Sabaragamuwa, says that in recent years, the enthusiasm of university students to major in Chinese has registered a conspicuous upward trend. This year, there are 21 students who have chosen Chinese as their primary major and an additional 50 students selected Chinese as their second or third major, accounting for more than one-fifth of the students in the same grade. All thanks to the enthusiastic efforts of the three Chinese teachers, Abeywickrama adds. The Confucius Classroom offers students more opportunities to connect with China, experience Chinese culture, and even participate in study tours to China, while fostering friendship between Sri Lanka and China. With the Confucius Classroom established here, the Chinese language dreams of the students in the mountain areas are no longer distant, Abeywickrama says. Source: Xinhua --Agencies",

        "title": "Hundreds of thousands in Cuba without water",
        "date": "September 14, 2024 03:06 pm",
        "content": "Water shortages in Cuba are increasingly flaring tempers, including in capital Havana, as problems mount for hundreds of thousands of residents already ragged from shortfalls in food, fuel and electricity. Upwards of 600,000 people - more than 1 in 20 on the Caribbean island of 10 million citizens - are suffering from water supply issues, officials said earlier this month. Havana is the worst affected by water shortages, though most of the countrys largest cities report over 30,000 customers without water, the government has said. Officials blame the growing problems on crumbling infrastructure and a persistent lack of fuel, symptoms of a festering economic crisis that has blighted growth and left the Communist-run country nearly bankrupt. Rachel Trimiño, 32, said the root causes are no mystery, even in her Havana neighborhood of Vedado, a comparatively upscale district of the capital. All of the streets are full of leaking pipes, clean running water ... but nothing in our homes, she said. The problem defies quick fixes. Spare parts for outdated water infrastructure, like pipes and pumps, are in short supply, officials said. And without fuel and adequate transportation, even emergency water supply by cistern truck has been limited, according to residents. Frequent blackouts only make matters worse. When they cut off power, we cant give water, said San Miguel de Padron resident Pedro Martino, who works with a church group that offers residents small quantities to stem the shortfall. One thing depends on the other, and thats the game we play. Isolated protests have erupted in some areas, as residents overwhelmed by the growing list of problems and shortages lose patience in the still blistering heat of the tropical summer. Cubas economy has been decimated by a combination of factors, including the COVID-19 pandemic, stiffened U.S. sanctions and a state-dominated business model plagued by bureaucracy, mismanagement and corruption. The social and economic crisis is widely seen as among the worst since Fidel Castros 1959 revolution, leading to a record-breaking exodus of Cuban migrants in the past two years.

Now, in a rush for the upcoming election, the president is making announcements about reducing taxes, increasing salaries, and offering concessions. These concessions should have been implemented at the start of the year, not at this late stage, he declared.

I heard Mr. Anura Kumara accuse us of plotting violent acts. We have never engaged in violence. The people of this country will not fall for the traps hes setting, Premadasa asserted.

        "title": "Iran says it successfully launched a satellite into space",
        "date": "September 14, 2024 03:32 pm",
        "content": "Iran launched a satellite into space Saturday with a rocket built by the countrys paramilitary Revolutionary Guard, state-run media reported, the latest for a program the West fears helps Tehran advance its ballistic missile program. Iran described the launch as a success, which would be the second such launch to put a satellite into orbit with the rocket. There was no immediate independent confirmation of the launchs success, nor did Iranian authorities immediately provide footage or other details. The launch comes amid heightened tensions gripping the wider Middle East over the ongoing Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip, during which Tehran launched an unprecedented direct missile-and-drone attack on Israel. Meanwhile, Iran continues to enrich uranium to nearly weapons-grade levels, raising concerns among nonproliferation experts about Tehrans program. Iran identified the satellite-carrying rocket as the Qaem-100, which the Guard used in January for another successful launch. Qaem means upright in Irans Farsi language. The solid-fuel rocket put the Chamran-1 satellite, weighing 60 kilograms (132 pounds), into a 550-kilometer (340-mile) orbit, state media reported. The U.S. State Department and the American military did not immediately respond to requests for comment over the Iranian launch. The United States had previously said Irans satellite launches defy a U.N. Security Council resolution and called on Tehran to undertake no activity involving ballistic missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons. U.N. sanctions related to Irans ballistic missile program expired last October. Under Irans relatively moderate former President Hassan Rouhani, the Islamic Republic slowed its space program for fear of raising tensions with the West. Hard-line President Ebrahim Raisi, a protege of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei who came to power in 2021, has pushed the program forward. Raisi died in a helicopter crash in May. Its unclear what Irans new president, the reformist Masoud Pezeshkian, wants for the program as he was silent on the issue while campaigning. The U.S. intelligence communitys worldwide threat assessment this year said Irans development of satellite launch vehicles would shorten the timeline for Iran to develop an intercontinental ballistic missile because it uses similar technology. Intercontinental ballistic missiles can be used to deliver nuclear weapons. Iran is now producing uranium close to weapons-grade levels after the collapse of its nuclear deal with world powers. Tehran has enough enriched uranium for several nuclear weapons, if it chooses to produce them, the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency repeatedly has warned. Iran has always denied seeking nuclear weapons and says its space program, like its nuclear activities, is for purely civilian purposes. However, U.S. intelligence agencies and the IAEA say Iran had an organized military nuclear program up until 2003. The launch also came ahead of the second anniversary of the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini, which sparked nationwide protests against Irans mandatory headscarf, or hijab, law and the countrys Shiite theocracy.

        "date": "September 14, 2024 04:19 pm",
        "content": "The Maldives says its financial troubles are temporary and the luxury tourist destination has no plans to seek an International Monetary Fund bailout after warnings of a possible sovereign default. Foreign minister Moosa Zameer said the Indian Ocean archipelago, best known for its upscale resorts and celebrity visitors, was pressing ahead with tax hikes to meet its debt servicing obligations. We have bilateral partners who are very sensitive to our needs and our situation, Zameer told reporters in Colombo on Friday night. I seriously dont think it is a time where we will be right now engaging with the IMF... The issue that we have is very temporary because currently we are having a dip in reserves. He said tax reforms, along with the rationalisation of state-owned enterprises, would improve liquidity. Zameer was visiting Sri Lanka along with Finance Minister Mohamed Shafeeq to meet with local central bankers and other officials. China and India are the two largest bilateral lenders to the Maldives, a tiny nation of 1,192 tiny coral islands in the Indian Ocean scattered across the equator. President Mohamed Muizzu came to power a year ago on the back of a campaign to evict a small contingent of Indian troops deployed in the Maldives and pursue closer ties with China. - Rough patches - After the removal of the troops, the two nations have mended fences and had cleared misunderstandings, Zameer said. At the start of our government, we did have some rough patches, you know, he added. We have fantastic bilateral relations with both China and India... Both countries continue to support us. China has pledged more funding since last years victory by Muizzu, who thanked the country for its selfless assistance for development funds on a state visit to Beijing shortly after taking power. Official data showed the Maldives foreign debt at 3.37 billion in the first quarter of this year, equating to around 45 percent of gross domestic product. China accounted for about 20 percent of the external debt while India owned just under 18 percent. Zameers visit came days after Moodys Ratings downgraded the Maldives credit rating by one notch to Caa2, considered a high credit risk. Fellow ratings agency Fitch downgraded the Maldives in June, saying that dwindling foreign currency reserves posed a financial risk. It said the governments debt servicing obligations, amounting to 409 million this year, would add to severe stress. Source: AFP --Agencies",

        "content": "A Jaya Pirith chanting ceremony was held this morning (14) in Hikkaduwa to invoke blessings on the Sarvajana Balaya presidential candidate, entrepreneur Dilith Jayaweera. Speaking during the event, the chief incumbent of the Kurunduwatta Bodhimalu Viharaya, Ven. Medamulane Vijayabodhi Thero called on Mr. Jayaweera for the protection of Sri Lankas sacred heritage and the Buddha Sasana. During his address, Ven. Vijayabodhi Thero emphasized the importance of preserving the Kurunduwatta Bodhimalu Vihara and its Buddha statue, urging continued vigilance in safeguarding the nations religious and cultural treasures. Historically, presidents have sought the wisdom of village monks before visiting the prominent temples. This practice should not be forgotten, said the Thero. Knowledge is a persons greatest wealth, and seeing your virtue and wisdom, everyone in the nation will treat you well. Always safeguard this blessed land as well as the Ruwanwelisaya, Sri Maha Bodhi, and the Sri Dalada Maligawa (Temple of Tooth Relic). Never forget the sanctity of the village temple, he added. Meanwhile, a public meeting as part of the Dilith Gamata series of constituency meetings was held in Kaduruwela yesterday (13). Addressing the gathering, presidential candidate Dilith Jayaweera urged the public to move beyond traditional politics and join together with the Sarvajana Balaya alliance for a new direction in the countrys leadership. Developed countries of the world use this concept of cooperative, Mr. Jayaweera said. Using that how can we, in Sri Lanka, cultivate our paddy fields more efficiently without physically working the fields? By leveraging modern machinery and technology with minimal costs, we can achieve this. We have proposed the necessary program for that. My program has proposed how to reduce social inequality and distribute wealth more equitably. I am committed to bringing about the change youve long desired, enhancing the income status of all Sri Lankans, he added. Furthering, he reiterated his commitment to transformative policies aimed at creating a more prosperous and equitable society, with a focus on sustainable growth and modernized agricultural practices.",

The President reiterated that his policy statement includes strengthening provincial councils and delegating more powers to them. He also mentioned that, under the framework of nine provincial administrations, development plans will be accelerated to assist the central government.

Following the recommendations of the Navas Commission, he pledged to fully resolve the issue of the disappeared within the next five years. President Ranil Wickremesinghe made these remarks this morning (14) while addressing the Ranil ta Puluwan rally at the Muttuweli Grounds in Jaffna. Recalling how former Agriculture Minister Anura Kumara led a major movement in the South against the Provincial Councils and various promises were made to the people of Jaffna today, he said there must be a commitment to ensure these promises are fulfilled. He also reflected on the recent economic crisis when Sinhala, Tamil, and Muslim communities had lost hope and had no clear vision for the future. Wickremesinghe said that he provided a vision for the future through the Puluwan Sri Lanka plan, which has since opened doors for the countrys economic recovery. The President referred to a statement issued by the IMF yesterday, warning that if the government does not continue the program it started with the IMF, the economy could collapse again. He stressed that it is everyones responsibility to safeguard and advance the recovery plan. President Wickremesinghe further stated that if this plan continues for another three years, no one will be able to destroy the countrys economy.

The statement came on Friday as fishermen community and the villagers in Tharuvaikulam of Tamil Nadus Thoothukudi district staged a one-day hunger strike on Monday demanding the release of 22 fishermen arrested by the Sri Lankan Navy. In a post on X, Indian Embassy in Sri Lanka stated, Returning home to India! 19 Indian fishermen have been safely repatriated from Sri Lanka and are on their way back to Chennai. Speaking to ANI, Murugan, one of the protestors, urged the central and state governments to cancel the fine imposed by the court on the fishermen and facilitate the recovery of two powerboats seized by the Sri Lankan Navy along with the release of 22 fishermen. The Sri Lankan Navy arrested 22 fishermen who had gone fishing in two boats last month from Tharuvaikulam, Tuticorin district, claiming that they had entered Sri Lankan territory. The 22 fishermen were then handed over to the Kalpiti Fisheries Department. They were produced before the Puttalam District Kalpitiya Tourism Court later and have been lodged in the Wariyapola Jail. The trial is underway in the court there, Murugan said. According to the protestors, the Sri Lankan court has asked 12 fishermen aboard one of the boats to pay a fine of Rs 42 lakh (Rs 1.5 crore in Sri Lankan currency) and given them a six-month sentence in default of payment. The protestors have demanded relief from this fine. Earlier, as per a letter written by Tamil Nadu Chief Minister MK Stalin on September 7, 14 fishermen from Pudukkottai District along with their three mechanised fishing boats were taken into custody by the Sri Lankan Navy.

Speaking at a health conference held in Colombo, Premadasa outlined: After the 21st, we will have the opportunity to address the critical issues that have long plagued our health system. He further emphasized that transforming Sri Lankas healthcare infrastructure cannot rely solely on traditional public investment and funding. Instead, he advocated for a fresh approach that includes a robust foster care system for every Medical Officer of Health (MOH) division and hospital across the country. Premadasa proposed the introduction of a charity system to supplement government funding. While various stakeholders often highlight allocations as a percentage of GDP, we need to recognize that government investment alone is insufficient to revitalize our health system, he noted. The SJB candidate also highlighted the importance of preventive healthcare programs. He acknowledged the existing preventive initiatives under the MOH divisions and pledged to enhance these efforts to ensure healthier lives for all Sri Lankans.",

Addressing a public rally in Mirigama, Dissanayake expressed his intent to pursue legal action against individuals who disseminate misleading claims. Dissanayake criticized his political opponents, accusing them of resorting to conspiracy theories as their primary defense. Their politics have deteriorated to the point where they can only respond with baseless conspiracy theories, Dissanayake stated. He contrasted his campaigns focus on national unity with what he described as the divisive rhetoric of his opponents. Drawing comparisons, Dissanayake noted that while Ranil Wickremesinghe and Sajith Premadasa align with regional leaders Athaullah (A. L. M. Athaullah, MP) and Hakeem (Rauff Hakeem, MP) respectively, his own campaign is grounded in a message of unity that has been a longstanding principle of his party. He rebuked Premadasa for relying on outdated racial narratives, suggesting that such tactics are unworthy of contemporary politics. In response to criticisms from figures like SJBs Tissa Attanayake, who alleged that a government led by the National Peoples Power would disrupt traditional cultural events like the Perehara, Dissanayake promised to hold these critics accountable in court. We will bring all those who have spread such falsehoods about our intentions in a Perehara (procession) to the court, he declared.",

Furthermore, Rajapaksa outlined his focus on the agricultural sector, underscoring the importance of maximizing the use of cultivable land and supporting farmers with fertilizer subsidies.

        "date": "September 15, 2024 02:17 pm",
        "content": "SpaceXs Polaris Dawn crew is home, capping off a five-day mission to orbit  which included the worlds first commercial spacewalk  by splashing down in the Gulf of Mexico. The Crew Dragon capsule carrying four astronauts landed off the coast of Dry Tortugas, Florida, at 3:37 a.m. ET Sunday. The Polaris Dawn mission made history as it reached a higher altitude than any human has traveled in five decades. A spacewalk conducted early Thursday morning also marked the first time such an endeavor has been completed by a privately funded and operated mission. But returning to Earth is among the most dangerous stretches of any space mission. To safely reach home, the Crew Dragon capsule carried out whats called a de-orbit burn, orienting itself as it prepared to slice through the thickest part of Earths atmosphere. The spacecraft then reached extremely hot temperatures  up to 3,500 degrees Fahrenheit (1,900 degrees Celsius)  because of the pressure and friction caused by hitting the air while still traveling around 17,000 miles per hour (27,000 kilometers per hour). The crew, however, should have remained at comfortable temperatures, protected by the Crew Dragons heat shield, which is located on the bottom of the 13-foot-wide (4-meter-wide) capsule. Dragging against the air began to slow the vehicle down before the Crew Dragon deployed parachutes that further decelerated its descent. Having hit the ocean, the spacecraft briefly bobbed around in the water until rescue crews waiting nearby hauled it out of the ocean and onto a special boat, referred to as the Dragons nest. Final safety checks take place there before the crew can disembark from the capsule and begin the journey back to dry land. A historic flight The Polaris Dawn crew includes mission commander Jared Isaacman, the billionaire CEO of the finance company Shift4 Payments; his close friend and former US Air Force pilot Scott Kidd Poteet; and SpaceX operations engineers Anna Menon and Sarah Gillis. The quartet kicked off this mission by breaking an altitude record, reaching an orbit around Earth that extended as high as 870 miles (1,400 kilometers). Thats the highest Earth orbit ever traveled by humans, beating a 1966 record set by NASAs Gemini 11 mission, which reached 853 miles (1,373 kilometers). The crews apogee  or farthest point from Earth  made Gillis and Menon the first women ever to fly so far from our planet. The apogee also marked the farthest any human has journeyed since NASAs Apollo Program ended in 1972. The Crew Dragon capsule then lowered its altitude to carry out the spacewalk. The high-risk event, also called an extravehicular activity or EVA, saw the Crew Dragon capsule become entirely depressurized before Isaacman opened the hatch, exposing the group to the vacuum of space. Isaacman and Gillis exited the vehicle for roughly 10 minutes each, carrying out a series of tests to understand the functionality of the EVA suits, before retreating inside the Crew Dragon spacecraft and latching the hatch. The spacewalk appeared to go off without any major issues. Isaacman reported after taking his first glimpse outside the spacecraft, Back at home we all have a lot of work to do, but from here  looks like a perfect world. The remainder of the crews time in orbit was spent carrying out nearly 40 science experiments and research, including some that sought to better understand space adaptation syndrome  a type of microgravity-specific motion sickness. Gillis, a trained violinist, also brought her instrument along for the mission and delivered a rendition of Reys Theme from Star Wars: The Force Awakens. Gillis music was sent back to Earth using SpaceXs Starlink as a test of the satellite networks potential to provide in-space connectivity. Menon also took time to read a book she coauthored  called Kisses From Space  to her family as well as a group of patients from St. Jude Childrens Hospital as part of a fundraiser. Sundays anticipated return marks the conclusion of the third trip to space for the specific Crew Dragon capsule powering the Polaris Dawn mission. The spacecraft  named Resilience by the NASA astronauts onboard its first trip to space in November 2020, called Crew-1  flew the 2021 Inspiration 4 mission. That trip, also funded by Isaacman, saw him and three crewmates circle Earth for three days as part of a fundraiser for childhood cancer research. Source: CNN --Agencies",

Addressing a rally held in Kalalgoda, Jayaweera highlighted the pivotal role women play in both family and national prosperity, stating: One of the primary reasons for my political foray is the women of Sri Lanka. For years, I have been advocating for greater recognition of their role in our society. We need to harness and support the entrepreneurship of Sri Lankan women. Despite the challenges of a reduced household income and soaring living costs, Sri Lankan women have maintained the integrity and happiness of their families. This is a testament to their entrepreneurial spirit, he remarked. He noted that women constitute 53 of the population, yet many remain underrepresented in the economic sector. To enhance Sri Lankas GDP, we must ensure that women are more actively involved in the economic process. The management skills demonstrated by women in maintaining family happiness are akin to entrepreneurship. By recognizing and expanding these skills into broader economic roles, we can drive national growth, Jayaweera argued. He further said: Sri Lankan women have the capacity to become stars in our economic sphere, given their proven ability to manage and nurture their families. Their potential to influence and drive economic success is immense.",

        "content": "Russia and Ukraine have exchanged 206 prisoners of war in a deal brokered by the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Russias ministry of defence said its 103 released servicemen came from among those captured during the Kursk incursion. Posting pictures of some of those released on Saturday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said: Our people are home. Last month, Ukrainian forces launched a surprise attack across the Russian border, advancing up to 30km (18 miles) into the Kursk region. Zelensky said those Ukrainians released included 82 privates and sergeants and 21 officers from the armed forces, national guard, border guards, and police. He said they had been captured defending the regions of Kyiv, Donetsk, Mariupol, Azovstal, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kharkiv. Russia said its released soldiers were in Belarus and would be given the necessary psychological and medical assistance and would be allowed to contact their relatives before being returned to Russia. The UAE, which has remained broadly neutral in the conflict, has acted as a mediator for previous prisoner swaps. In August, following the Kursk incursion, an initial exchange was completed involving 230 prisoners in total. Ukraines incursion into Kursk was in part intended to draw troops away from Russias operations in eastern Ukraine. The latest swap comes as Russia said it had recaptured a village in eastern Ukraine, where it has made a number of advances over recent weeks. On Saturday, the ministry of defence said its forces had taken the village of Zhelanne Pershe in the Pokrovsk district. It is less than 30km (19 miles) from the town of Pokrovsk, which is home to a key railway station and sits at the intersections of several important roads. The town plays a crucial role as a logistics hub for Ukrainian forces in the eastern region of Donbas, and has for months been a key target for Russian forces. Source: BBC --Agencies",

        "content": "Shogun could be in for an epic night, The Bear could clean up for the second time in less than a year, and Baby Reindeer has gone from dark horse to contender as the 76th Primetime Emmy Awards arrive on Sunday. Back in their traditional mid-September spot after a single strike-delayed edition in January, the Emmys will air live on ABC from the Peacock Theater in downtown Los Angeles. The father and son duo of Eugene and Dan Levy, the winning stars of the 2020 Emmys with their show Schitts Creek, will host. Heres a look at the how the evening could play out across the major categories. How to watch and stream the Emmys The show begins at 8 p.m. Eastern and is being shown live on ABC, which is available with an antenna or through cable and satellite providers. The Emmys can be also streamed live through live TV streaming services that include ABC in their lineup, like Hulu Live TV, YouTube TV and FuboTV. For those without a live TV streaming service, the show will be streaming Monday on Hulu. Whos nominated for drama series at the Emmys It may be impossible to slow the roll of Shogun. With its 14 wins at the precursor Creative Arts Emmy Awards last weekend, the FX series about lordly politicking in feudal Japan has already set a record for most Emmys for a single season of a series. On Sunday night it can extend its record by six, and industry prognosticators are predicting it will get them all. The show seized all the Emmy power in the top categories by shifting from the limited series to the drama category in May when it began developing more seasons. And it was in some ways Emmy royalty from the start. During the golden age of the miniseries, the original 1980 Shogun, based on James Clavells historical novel, won three including best limited series. If it faces any competition at all for the best drama prize, it could come for the sixth and final season of The Crown, the only show among the nominees that has won before in a category recently dominated by the retired Succession. Veteran screen star Hiroyuki Sanada, up for best actor, and Anna Sawai, up for best actress, are in position to become the first Japanese actors to win Emmys. Sanada could face a challenge from Gary Oldman, who has been quietly creating one of his career defining roles on Apple TV as schlubby spy chief Jackson Lamb on Slow Horses. Sawais competition comes from Emmy luminary Jennifer Aniston of The Morning Show, who has only won once before in 10 nominations. Imelda Staunton could win her first for playing Queen Elizabeth II on The Crown. The comedy landscape at the Emmys This looks to be the year of FX, which is also in for a likely victory lap for The Bear. The Bear took most of the big comedy Emmys home in January for its first season, and is expected to do the same Sunday for its second, which includes nominations for best comedy series, best actor for Jeremy Allen White and best supporting actor for Ebon Moss-Bachrach. Ayo Edebiri, reigning best supporting actress, moves to the lead actress category for a character who is essentially a co-lead on the culinary dramedy. That means shell be up against Jean Smart, a two-time winner in the category for Hacks who is back in the competition after a year off. Meryl Streep, among several Academy Award winners among the nights nominees, could win her fourth Emmy to go with her three Oscars. Shes up for best supporting actress in a comedy for Only Murders in the Building. Limited series categories at the Emmys Another multiple Oscar winner, Jodie Foster, could get her first Emmy for best actress in a limited series for True Detective: Night Country. The HBO show that features Foster as a police chief investigating mysterious deaths in the darkness of a north Alaskan winter was the top nominee among limited or anthology series. Kali Reis could become the first Indigenous woman to win an Emmy in the supporting actress category. A few months ago it looked as though the show would vie with Fargo for the top prizes, but Netflixs darkly quirky Baby Reindeer surged on the eve of nominations and is now the popular pick for best limited series, best actor for creator and star Richard Gadd and best supporting actress for the woman who plays his tormentor, Jessica Gunning. Gadds category also includes Andrew Scott for Netflixs Ripley, and Jon Hamm, who has two shots at winning his second Emmy between his nomination here for Fargo and for supporting actor in a drama for The Morning Show.

        "date": "September 15, 2024 04:45 pm",
        "content": "In a rare celestial event, an asteroid, named 2024 PT5, heading towards Earth is set to have an unusual fate. Instead of smashing through the planets atmosphere, as usually others do, 2024 PT5 is likely to be trapped in Earths orbit and become a mini-moon. However, 2024 PT5 is likely to remain in Earths gravitational pull for only two months. The asteroid 2024 PT5, discovered on August 7 by two astronomers from the Complutense University of Madrid, Carlos de la Fuente Marcos and Raúl de la Fuente Marcos using NASAs asteroid impact early warning system Asteroid Terrestrial-Impact Last Alert System (ATLAS). According to a report published in the Research Notes of the American Astronomical Society, both astronomers stressed that 2024 PT5 is approximately 10 meters (33 feet) in diameter and will be captured in Earths orbit for a brief window between September 29 and November 25. During this two-month period, the 2024 PT5 will loop around the Earth but will not complete a full orbit, it will break free from earths gravitational pull and fall back into the Suns orbit and continue its journey through the Solar System. In simple words, for a total of 56.6 days, Earth will have two moons. It is pretty cool, said Federica Spoto, an asteroid dynamics researcher at the Center for Astrophysics, Harvard  Smithsonian. 2024 PT5 will help scientists better understand asteroids that come close to Earthsome of which occasionally collide with it, Spoto added. Mini-moon The study further notes that 2024 PT5 is unlikely to be artificial. It is not just a piece of space junk. The researchers suggest it could be defined as a near-Earth object with a similar orbit to our planet. The researchers said, unfortunately, it would be too dim to see with the naked eye. According to the NASA JPL, 2024 PT5 has an absolute magnitude of 27.6, which is very dim and wont be visible through most amateur telescopes. According to Paul Chodas, the director of the Center for Near Earth Object Studies at NASAs Jet Propulsion Laboratory, 2024 PT5 might be a fragment of the moon itself, possibly ejected by a past lunar impact. The researchers further said 2024 PT5 is expected to make multiple mini-moon visits. The asteroid will return to Earths orbit in January 2025 before quickly leaving and returning again in 2055.

        "title": "Trump safe after apparent assassination attempt, person in custody",
        "date": "September 16, 2024 06:54 am",
        "content": "Donald Trump was the target of an apparent assassination attempt Sunday in Florida, the FBI said, with the Republican presidential candidates campaign and law enforcement reporting he was safe and unharmed. The US Secret Service confirmed one or more of its agents opened fire on a gunman located near the boundary of Trumps golf course, and that an AK-47 style rifle with a scope was recovered along with a GoPro video camera. Amid the confrontation with the Secret Service, the suspect bolted out of the shrubbery he had been hiding in and escaped in a black car. A witness helped police identify the vehicle and authorities tracked it down. We have somebody in custody right now that is a potential suspect, Palm Beach County Sheriff Ric Bradshaw told a news conference. Trump had been golfing at his course in West Palm Beach, Florida, not far from his Mar-a-Lago residence, when the would-be shooter was spotted in bushes one hole ahead of the former president, Bradshaw said. President Trump is safe following gunshots in his vicinity, his campaign spokesman Steven Cheung said in a statement, while Democratic presidential hopeful Kamala Harris expressed relief her political rival was out of danger. Trump himself said in a website fundraising message: Fear not! I am safe and well, and no one was hurt. Thank God! The unnerving incident appears to mark the second time in as many months that Trump has been the target of an assassination attempt. The former president was wounded in the ear on July 13 as he addressed an outdoor rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. Unsure if shot taken Authorities who addressed Sundays news conference did not confirm whether a gunman actually fired a weapon in the direction of the former president, but said that shots were fired by the Secret Service. We are not sure right now if the individual was able to take a shot at our agents, said Rafael Barros, of the Secret Service. The Federal Bureau of Investigation said it is investigating what appears to be an attempted assassination of former President Trump. Officials praised the quick action of the Secret Service, an agency that has been under intense scrutiny since its apparent failure to detect and stop a gunman from shooting at Trump in Pennsylvania. Sheriff Bradshaw said Secret Service personnel in Trumps protective detail spotted this rifle barrel sticking out of the fence and immediately engaged that individual, at which time the individual took off. He estimated the suspect was set up 300 to 500 yards (275 to 455 meters) away, but with a rifle and a scope like that, thats not a long distance. Sheriff William Snyder of neighboring Martin County said on CNN that the potential suspect who was stopped and detained by law enforcement had a relatively calm, flat affect. He was not displaying a lot of emotions. Relieved Law enforcement was launching a sweeping investigation but as of Sunday afternoon there was no indication of the shooters motive. The incident came amid heightened tensions in the knife-edge presidential race, and concern for the safety of both candidates. There is no place for political violence or for any violence ever in our country, President Joe Biden said in a statement. I have directed my team to continue to ensure that Secret Service has every resource, capability and protective measure necessary to ensure the former presidents continued safety. Vice President Harris took to social media to say I am glad he is safe. Several Trump supporters and members of his inner circle, including his running mate J.D. Vance, offered their support and gratitude that tragedy was avoided. Im glad President Trump is safe, Vance said on X. I spoke to him before the news was public and he was, amazingly, in good spirits. The Secret Service, tasked with protecting presidents, former presidents and other dignitaries, has faced criticism since the Pennsylvania shooting. Kimberly Cheatle, the head of the agency, resigned amid the ensuing scrutiny, and at least five agents were placed on administrative leave. Representative Elise Stefanik, the fourth-ranking US House Republican, thanked law enforcement for their actions Sunday but raised questions about the latest incident. We must ask ourselves how an assassin was allowed to get this close to President Trump again, she said in a statement. There continues to be a lack of answers for the horrific assassination attempt in Pennsylvania and we expect there to be a clear explanation of what happened today in Florida.

He expressed these views during the Derana 360 programme, aired on TV Derana last night (16). Jayaweera stated that the country is burdened with immense debt due to the decisions made by individual ministers. To prevent this, he suggested that before any ministry takes important decisions, they should be discussed, making a case for the formation of a National Strategic Planning Authority comprising scholars and experts. We are proposing a National Strategic Planning Authority through which decisions will be made. There hasnt been much dialogue about this. We propose that the countrys scholars and experts be included in this authority, he said. Jayaweera further suggested that any decisions made by ministries should be thoroughly discussed with representatives from all ministries, considering financial, environmental, and societal impacts, including those affecting children. This National Strategic Planning Authority is essential if we are to move this third-world country even an inch forward, no matter who is in power. We remain stuck in this massive debt because we allow ministers to make decisions on their own, he added.",

Flights, ferries and train services were suspended in the megacity and in neighboring provinces, disrupting travel during Chinas three-day Mid-Autumn Festival. Shanghais airports canceled hundreds of flights starting Sunday and through Monday, while in Hangzhou, about 170 kilometers (106 miles) southwest of Shanghai, authorities were also planning to cancel more than 180 flights. More than 60,000 emergency responders and firefighters were at hand to lend aid in Shanghai, according to state media. More than 414,000 people had been evacuated by Monday. Bebinca made landfall around 7:30 a.m. in the sprawling Pudong business district with maximum winds of 151 kph (94 mph) near its center. Authorities expected the typhoon would also affect the nearby provinces of Zhejiang, Jiangsu and Anhui. Shanghai, which has 25 million people, is rarely hit by strong typhoons, which usually make landfall further south in China. Typhoon Yagi hit Chinas southern Hainan island earlier this month and has caused devastation in Southeast Asia. In Myanmar, Yagi caused at least 74 deaths with dozens missing. Four deaths were reported in Hainan, at least 10 have died in Thailand and 20 in the Philippines.

        "date": "September 16, 2024 10:28 am",
        "content": "Shogun had historic wins in an epic 18-Emmy first season, Hacks scored an upset for best comedy on what was still a four-trophy night for The Bear, and Baby Reindeer had a holiday at an Emmy Awards that had some surprising swerves. Shogun, the FX series about power struggles in feudal Japan, won best drama series for its first, while Hiroyuki Sanada became the first Japanese performer to win an Emmy when he won best actor in a drama and co-star Anna Sawai became the second moments later when she won best actress. Shogun taught me when we work together, we can make miracles, Sanada said in his acceptance speech. Along with 14 Emmys it claimed at the precursor Creative Arts Emmys and a directing win Sunday night, it had an unmatched performance with 18 overall for one season. Hacks was the surprise winner of the best comedy series award for the first time, topping The Bear, which most had expected after four big wins earlier in the evening. Jean Smart won her third best actress in a comedy award for the third season of Hacks, in which her stand-up comic character Deborah Vance tries to make it in late-night TV. Smart has six Emmys overall. Despite losing out on the nights biggest prize after winning it for its first season at Januarys strike-delayed ceremony, FXs The Bear came back for seconds with major acting wins. Star Jeremy Allen White won best actor in a comedy for the second straight year, and Ebon Moss-Bachrach repeated as best supporting actor. A surprise came when Liza Colón-Zayas won best supporting actor over major competition. How could I have thought it would be possible to be in the presence of Meryl Streep and Carol Burnett, Colón-Zayas said as tears welled in her eyes as she accepted the award on the stage of the Peacock Theater in Los Angeles. She is the first Latina to win in the category. To all the Latinas who are looking at me, she said, keep believing and vote. Netflixs darkly quirky Baby Reindeer won best limited series. Creator and star Richard Gadd won for his lead acting and his writing and Jessica Gunning, who plays his tormentor, won best supporting actress. Accepting the best limited series award, Gadd urged the makers of television to take chances. The only constant across any success in television is good storytelling, he said. Good storytelling that speaks to our times. So take risks, push boundaries. Explore the uncomfortable. Dare to fail in order to achieve. Baby Reindeer is based on a one man-stage show in which Gadd describes being sexually abused along with other emotional struggles. Accepting that award, he said, no matter how bad it gets, it always gets better. The Associated Press does not typically name people who say they have been sexually abused unless they come forward publicly as Gadd has. Jodie Foster won her first Emmy to go with her two Oscars when she took best actress in a limited series for True Detective: Night Country. The creator of The Bear was also a repeat winner. Christopher Storer took his second straight Emmy for directing, an award handed out by reunited Happy Days co-stars Ron Howard and Henry Winkler. White said backstage that he was watching in the wings as Colón-Zayas won and that was just the greatest. He also shouted out two acting wins the show had already scored at last weekends Creative Arts Emmy Awards, when Jamie Lee Curtis won best guest actress in a comedy for playing his mother, and Jon Bernthal won best guest actor for playing his big brother. The Bear won seven times at that ceremony, totaling 11 overall for its second season. The father-son hosting duo of Eugene and Dan Levy in their monologue at the top of the show mocked the very dramatic The Bear being in the comedy category. In honor of The Bear we will be making no jokes, Eugene Levy said, to laughs. The evening managed to meet many expectations but included several swerves like the win for Hacks and a quiet start to the night for Shogun, which didnt win its first trophy until past the halfway point. Elizabeth Debicki took best supporting actress in a drama for playing Princess Diana at the end of her life in the sixth and final season of The Crown. Playing this part, based on this unparalleled, incredible human being, has been my great privilege, Debicki said. Its been a gift. Billy Crudup won best actor in a drama for The Morning Show. Streep wasnt the only Oscar winner trumped by a lesser-known name. Robert Downey Jr., the reigning best supporting actor winner for Oppenheimer, was considered the favorite to win best supporting actor in a limited series for The Sympathizer, but that award went to Lamorne Morris for Fargo. Robert Downey Jr. I have a poster of you in my house! Morris said from the stage as he accepted his first Emmy. Several awards were presented by themed teams from TV history, including sitcom dads George Lopez, Damon Wayans and Jesse Tyler Ferguson and TV moms Meredith Baxter, Connie Britton, and Susan Kelechi Watson.

There are about 107 rehabilitation camps for Sri Lankan Tamils in the Tamil Nadu state. Most of them came into existence about 37 years ago. The rehabilitation camps at Kottapattu in Tiruchi district and Mandapam in Ramanathapuram district are among the biggest refugee camps in the State. The camp at Kottapattu has 470 houses and about 1,200 Sri Lankan refugees have been sheltered. Several houses in the Kottapattu camp are said to be in a bad shape due to poor maintenance. Though the State government made attempts to repair the badly damaged houses, it is said that the condition of them has deteriorated due to age and other factors. Based on the field reports of the condition of the camps and the demands of the inmates, the Commissionerate of Rehabilitation and the Welfare of Non-Resident Tamils has decided to build new houses at Kottapattu. A senior official told The Hindu the State government had sanctioned INR 300 million for building new houses to the Sri Lankan refugees living at Kottapattu camp. Most of the houses were in a poor condition. It had been proposed to build more than 500 houses. The District Rural Development Agency (DRDA) would be entrusted with the task of building the houses. The houses would be constructed close to the existing camp at Kottapattu. The process of identifying a site was on. Once it was identified, the construction work would begin. The official added the inmates of the camp would not be disturbed until the completion of new houses, and they would continue to live in the existing houses. They would move to the new campus after the allocation of new houses. Source: The Hindu --Agencies",

This year, we are all facing a presidential election set against a backdrop that reflects the psychological demand for change from Sri Lankan society, he stated, adding that However, none of the candidates in this presidential race truly represent change, regardless of how they present themselves. Speaking further, Jayaweera said: Those seeking power are motivated by the desire for power itself. The destructive forces inherent in that power are merely a matter of degree; the percentage may vary, but the underlying approach remains the same. They have not addressed how the lives of the people of this country will improve. Instead, they have generated more division and resentment. People want to understand how their lives will change. In Sri Lankas tourism industry; they want to know how a Sri Lankan three-wheeler entrepreneurs life will be enhanced, how their income will increase, their standard of living will improve, and their social status will rise. None of the candidates are providing these answers. This is why Dilith Jayaweera stands apart from the rest. He is not a politician driven by personal ambition. Instead, he is driven by the belief that he is here to serve the people based on concepts and compassion that have been lost in politics. His approach is grounded in this belief. A program has been presented, and there is still time to discuss and consider it. Reflect on this for a moment.

Honorary consuls, typically citizens of the host country, voluntarily provide essential consular services. The honorary consul in Haifa continues to offer such services, operating from an office they maintain in a voluntary capacity, Sabry highlighted. Additionally, the Foreign Minister expressed that since the date, Sri Lanka has not established any new consulates nor made additional honorary consul appointments in Israel. Any claims suggesting otherwise are inaccurate and do not reflect the official position or actions of the Sri Lankan government, he said. He also noted that it is customary for honorary consuls to relocate their offices within their jurisdiction based on personal or business considerations, mentioning that these relocations are purely administrative and should not be misinterpreted as the establishment of new consular offices.

The 21-year-old overcame competition from South Africas Keshav Maharaj and West Indies Jayden Seales to secure the award. Wellalage, the former Sri Lanka U19 skipper, made big strides in his nascent international career in August 2024. With his help, Sri Lanka overcame India for the first time in a bilateral ODI series since 1997. The Island nation had a significant challenge in the form of India, the ICC Mens Cricket World Cup runner-up. The Men in Blue had already secured a 3-0 T20I series win against Sri Lanka and with the return of top stars like Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma, India were easily the favourites to win the ODI series. Wellalage with 108 runs and seven wickets helped Sri Lanka overcome the India challenge in the series, contributing at crucial stages of each game. He scored a career-best 67 and followed it up with wickets of Rohit and Shubman Gill in the first ODI that ended in a thrilling tie. He made another crucial contribution with a fighting 39 in the second ODI that helped Sri Lanka to a winning total. He didnt click with the bat in the third game, but went on to achieve the career-best figures of 527, derailing the India innings before it could take off, getting the important wickets of Kohli, Rohit, and Shreyas Iyer on the way to his five-for. Wellalage expressed his immense satisfaction upon receiving the award. This recognition gives me further strength to continue doing the good work I do as a player and contribute to my team to reach excellence in the field. I wish to thank my teammates, parents, friends, and relatives, as I am sure my achievement will provide them great satisfaction, as they have been supporting me all throughout. Recognition such as this, coming from the International Cricket Council, is great news for young players like us and will certainly encourage young players in the game. Its double delight for Sri Lanka this month, with compatriot Harshita Samarawickrama winning the ICC Womens Player of the Month award for August. Wellalage joins teammate Kamindu Mendis as Sri Lankan mens award winners in 2024, with Mendis claiming ICC Mens Player of the Month for March. --ICC--",

        "content": "The Ilankai Tamil Arasu Kachchi (ITAK) has officially reached a final decision to endorse Sajith Premadasa, the presidential candidate of the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB), at the upcoming presidential election. The announcement came after a party meeting held this morning (16) in Vavuniya, where the partys central committee made the final decision. Meanwhile, leader of the ITAK Mavai Senathirajah, who earlier extended his support for incumbent President Ranil Wickremesinghe, confirmed the partys support for Premadasa, as per the decision reached by the partys central committee following a thorough discussion and deliberation. However, not all within the party are in agreement, as Jaffna District Member of Parliament, S. Shritharan, has expressed his strong dissent against the partys decision. Speaking to the media, Shritharan urged the partys supporters to back the Tamil common candidate P. Ariyanethiran, who he believes represents the true aspirations of the Tamil people. He criticized the lack of commitment from Sinhalese presidential candidates to address Tamil peoples concerns and emphasized the need for a leader who genuinely advocates for Tamil interests. The ITAK is considered as the main political party of the Tamil National Alliance (TNA).",

        "date": "September 16, 2024 03:13 pm",
        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe has stated that his primary objective is to ease the burden on the lives of the people. Speaking during a public rally held in Horana, he emphasized the importance of upholding the agreements made with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and moving forward with them. The President noted that it is not feasible to alter these agreements, contrary to the claims made by Sajith and Anura. Additionally, President Wickremesinghe pointed out that Sajith and Anuras proposals lack the approval of the IMF, noting that the IMFs support is firmly behind the governments current program. Furthermore, Wickremesinghe elaborated: My primary goal is to ease the burden on peoples lives. We must continue to uphold our agreements with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), as we have no other source of support. The IMF has facilitated aid from 18 countries and provided us with a 10 billion advantage in managing our debt interest payments, he said. He further said that they need to transition to an export-driven economy and cannot sustain borrowing indefinitely, especially when their import expenses exceed their export income. To keep our economy strong, we must focus on building an export economy and modernizing our economic practices. Providing subsidies alone will not advance our country; we need to develop a robust economy together, he added. The President criticized Sajith and Anuras promises of offering everything for free, stating that Sajith and Anura are promising everything for free, but this is not feasible. They are misleading people to secure votes. Despite their claims of negotiating with the IMF, no such discussions have taken place. He further stated that the IMF has emphasized the importance of achieving the objectives of their current program to help Sri Lanka emerge from its severe economic crisis. They have stressed the need to continue implementing economic reforms, which means I must carry on with the program I initiated. I am the only one capable of advancing this program, he added.",

He made this statement during a rally held yesterday (15) in the Kaththankudy area. Drawing a parallel with Malaysias thriving tourism industry, Premadasa highlighted the potential for Sri Lanka to strengthen its own tourism sector. By taking cues from Malaysia, we can elevate our tourism industry to new heights, he remarked. He also pledged to address the housing issues in Kaththankudy by creating housing schemes for families without lands or houses. Additionally, he also promised to transform all 361 schools in the Batticaloa District into smart schools and to upgrade all local hospitals into smart hospitals. Commenting further, Premadasa criticized his rivals: Both Ranil Wickremesinghe and Anura Kumara Dissanayake were silent when the previous government committed that injustice to the Muslim community with Covid-19 cremation policy. They did not stand up for the Muslim community. He reminded of the SJBs strong stance on the issue, noting that his party had organized large protests both in parliament and on the streets against this unjust policy. Premadasa urged the people of Kaththaankudy, and the wider Muslim community, to reflect on these events when deciding on the countrys future leadership. Regardless of your religion or culture, its crucial that we safeguard Sri Lankas identity by choosing the right leader, he concluded.",

        "date": "September 16, 2024 04:52 pm",
        "content": "Sri Lankas Ministry of Finance, Economic Stabilisation and National Policies has issued a clarification on the countrys external debt service payments in the recent past. Issuing a statement, the Finance Ministry said it is observed that there is a perception in society that the prevailing economic stabilization in Sri Lanka is entirely due to external debt not being serviced, and that once debt service resumes, economic instability will return. Furthermore, the ministry mentioned that it is also unfortunate to note that this same narrative is being used to trivialize and undermine the necessity for the critical macroeconomic reforms that are in fact the actual drivers of economic stabilization. Accordingly, the Finance Ministry clarified that it is incorrect to say that all foreign debt is not being repaid and that the temporary moratorium on selected external debt service that was announced in April 2022 applied to external commercial debt and official bilateral debt. The statement further highlighted that the government continued to service multilateral debt as is the practice under the prevailing sovereign debt restructuring architecture. Accordingly, the government continually serviced multilateral debt even after the April 2022 moratorium on selected external debt service. Considering the impact of debt service of the overall economy (including Central Bank, State Banks, and private sector) on the balance of payments, in 2022 (including January to April) and 2023, Sri Lanka has made debt service payments of USD 2,483 million and USD 2,589 million, respectively as indicated in the Table below. This amounts to approximately half of the usual debt service payments that Sri Lanka has made in a typical year prior to the announcement of Debt Standstill in April 2022, the statement added. The full statement issued by the Ministry of Finance is as follows: Press Release-Clarification on Sri Lankas External Debt Service Payments in the Recent Past by Kaveesha Jayasundara on Scribd",

The NPPs presidential candidate Anura Kumara Dissanayake, who spoke during an Indian political chat show revealed that they would annul the project, the Indian news agency highlighted. Asked if the project posed a threat to the island nations energy sector sovereignty, Dissanayake said: Yes. We will definitely cancel it as it threatens our energy sovereignty. The Adani Group has faced fundamental rights litigation in Sri Lankas supreme court after it got approval for the proposed construction of a wind power project in the island nations north-eastern regions of Mannar and Pooneryn. The conglomerate was set to invest over 440 million in the 20-year agreement for the development of 484 megawatts of wind power in the region. Petitioners have raised environmental concerns and lack of transparency in the bidding process to grant Adani Green Energy the go-ahead. Petitioners have also argued that the agreed tariff of 0.0826 per kilo Watt hour (kWh) would be a loss to Sri Lanka and should be lowered to 0.005 per kWh. --With agencies inputs",

        "content": "At least 274 inmates have escaped from a prison in Nigerias Borno state following heavy flooding, the Nigerian Correctional Service said, as aid agencies reported more than 1,000 people had died across western and central Africa. Initially, 281 inmates escaped while they were being transferred to a safe and secure facility but seven were recaptured later, Nigerian Correctional Service spokesman Abubakar Umar said in a statement on Sunday. The flood brought down the walls of the correctional facilities, including the medium security custodial center Maiduguri (MSCC) as well as the staff quarters in the city, he said. Umar added that the service was aware of escapees identities, including their biometrics, and had made this information available to the public. The search for the inmates was ongoing, he said. Weeks of flooding across Nigeria have led to 269 deaths and displaced more than 640,000 people, according to the latest data from the countrys disaster management agency NEMA. Northern Nigeria has been the most affected by the floods, the data showed. Borno state is in the northeast of the country. Last month, the Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency (NIHSA) also warned of the rising water levels of the Niger River, one of the countrys largest rivers, urging states to be on alert. Extreme rainfall events are expected to increase in frequency and intensity across almost all of Africa, including Nigeria, as human-caused climate change heats the planet, projections from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change show. Around 4 million people have been affected by floods across Nigeria and its west and central African neighbors with surging waters leaving a trail of devastating effects, including multiple human casualties. In Chad, at least 487 people have lost their lives from flooding, according to Chadian media, with 265 others killed in similar flood incidents in Niger.

        "content": "A man suspected of plotting to assassinate former US president Donald Trump was charged with federal gun crimes yesterday. Ryan Wesley Routh, 58, was charged with possession of a firearm as a convicted felon and possession of a firearm with an obliterated serial number at his initial court appearance.

We are disappointed with the decision to pursue what we believe is an unjust prosecution of Mr Combs by the U.S. Attorneys Office, said Marc Agnifilo, an attorney for Combs to Reuters. Agnifilo said that Combs voluntarily relocated to New York in anticipation of the charges. A spokesperson for the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York declined to comment on Agnifilos remarks. Combs, 54, has faced several allegations of sexual assault. Last week, singer Dawn Richard filed a lawsuit accusing Combs of sexual assault, battery, sex trafficking, gender discrimination and fraud in the Southern District of New York. Combs denies the allegations. In the same month, Combs was ordered to pay 100 million in a different sexual assault lawsuit to Derrick Lee Smith, who accused Combs of drugging and sexually assaulting him at a party almost 30 years ago. An attorney for Combs said the rapper would move to have the judgment dismissed. RB vocalist Casandra Ventura sued Combs in 2023 accusing him of serial physical abuse, sexual slavery and rape during a 10-year professional and romantic relationship.

        "date": "September 17, 2024 12:52 pm",
        "content": "Floods in Myanmar have killed at least 226 people in just over a week, state media reported on Tuesday, after heavy rains brought on by Typhoon Yagi battered the central provinces of the war-torn Southeast Asian country. Around a third of Myanmars 55 million people are already in need humanitarian aid, following incessant conflict triggered by a Feb. 2021 coup when the powerful military unseated the civilian government of Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi. The areas hardest hit by the flooding include the second largest city of Mandalay, the capital Naypyitaw and parts of Shan state, a sprawling province that has seen heavy fighting in recent months. Some 77 people are still missing, state media said. A total of 388 relief camps were opened in nine regions and states, and the well-wishers donated drinking water, food and clothes, reported the Global New Light of Myanmar, the newspaper of the military government. In the Mandalay region alone, some 40,000 acres of agricultural land were submerged and some 26,700 houses damaged by the heavy rains and flooding, according to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA). The United Nations Childrens Fund (UNICEF) also said many flood-hit regions were difficult to reach as several roads were damaged and telecoms and electricity networks disrupted. Affected areas include camps for displaced people, including children, who were already struggling with limited services due to ongoing conflict, UNICEF said in a statement. REGIONAL IMPACT Typhoon Yagi, the strongest storm to hit Asia this year, has left a trail of devastation through parts of Southeast Asia, killing at least 292 people in Vietnam where it made landfall. In Thailand, the storm caused heavy rains and flooding that inundated northern cities, including on the border with Myanmar. At least 45 people have died across Thailand from flooding and flood-related events such as mudslides since last month, according to the Department of Disaster Prevention and Mitigation. At least three people were killed and over 440 families evacuated in Laos, where flooding across eight provinces have also swamped some 7,825 acres of paddy fields, according to UNICEF.

Definitely our aim in this election campaign was to gain power. We are able to win. He stated that they have nothing new planned for the next two days and that their expectation is to present their facts again and again, as well as to present facts to society regarding the criticisms and possible conspiracies against us from the side of the government and Sajiths camp.

An SJB parliamentarian spoke on two occasions about the danger of a disturbance. At the same time, we saw an incident reported at Jayawardenepura University, he said. Therefore, they may have an expectation of creating a conflict situation in the society in a conspiratorial manner. He stated that it is up to them to expose that and to request their supporters not to get involved in any such conflict in any way, as well as to urge the police and the armed forces to prevent the spread of such things through the powers vested in them if any conflict occurs.",

        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe cautioned the public against making the mistake of transferring a recovering patient, who was in critical condition, to the care of an unqualified doctor after receiving emergency treatment, on September 21. He emphasized that, just as a doctors license can be revoked by the Sri Lanka Medical Council for refusing to treat a patient, the public should reject politicians who abandoned their duty to revive the countrys economy in 2022. The President made these remarks while addressing the Public Service United Nurses Associations 2024 Nursing Conference held today (17) at the Waters Edge Hotel in Battaramulla. During the event, Ven. Dr. Venerable Dr. Muruththettuwe Ananda Nayaka Thero, Chancellor of the University of Colombo, presented a memorandum of proposals from the United Nurses Association to the President. In his speech, President Wickremesinghe reflected on the countrys economic recovery, noting that no one expected the economy, which was in a critical state, to show signs of improvement within two years. He compared Sri Lankas economy to a patient undergoing surgery and admitted to the emergency unit. He projected that by 2025, the patient will be stable enough to move to a general ward, relieving some of the burden on the people, and by 2026, the economy will be fully discharged from the hospital as the country begins to progress rapidly. President Ranil Wickremesinghe announced plans to enhance the role of the nursing service in Sri Lankas nation-building efforts. He emphasized his commitment to providing the necessary resources to develop a skilled nursing workforce equipped with modern technological knowledge. Additionally, a program will be established to facilitate the deployment of Sri Lankan nurses to meet both domestic and international demands, he said. The President also stated that a program is being developed to deploy Sri Lankan nurses to meet the increasing demand for healthcare professionals in Japan, Korea, China, Singapore, and European countries due to the growing global population.",

        "date": "September 17, 2024 09:13 pm",
        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe today (17) inaugurated the Western Automobile Assembly Private Limited (WAA) vehicle assembly plant in Kuliyapitiya, marking a significant milestone in the countrys automotive industry. This 27 million facility is now the largest vehicle assembly plant in South Asia, according to the Presidents Media Division. The first vehicle to be assembled at the factory, a 15-seater passenger van, is expected to enter the market by the end of the month. The factory, equipped with cutting-edge machinery designed by global automotive experts, will generate both direct and indirect employment opportunities for local youth, the PMD said. In line with international industry standards, the facility also houses a vocational training institute, offering young people the chance to gain skills that will qualify them for overseas job opportunities. During the ceremony, President Wickremesinghe unveiled a commemorative plaque and toured the factory, engaging in friendly conversation with staff. In his speech, the President emphasized that no one will be allowed to obstruct projects vital to strengthening the national economy, despite protests. He also noted that although the Western Automobile Factory was initiated in 2015, it lacked the necessary support for timely completion. President Ranil Wickremesinghe emphasized that his administration is committed to advancing development projects that will benefit the country, noting that significant job opportunities for youth were lost due to the 10-year delay in completing this project, which was initially expected to be finished in two years. He highlighted that the new factory will not only boost the local economy of Kuliyapitiya but also strengthen the national economy. In his speech at the ceremony, the President stated: We approved the establishment of this factory in 2015, but it faced significant opposition and protests. Investigations were even conducted in Parliament. The project, which was scheduled to launch in 2019, was delayed due to the impacts of COVID-19 and the economic crisis. After assuming the presidency, I made the decision to restart all these stalled projects. Today, we have finally commenced operations at the Western Automobile Company. This factory has the capacity to produce 50,000 vehicles annually, which will strengthen our export sector. Although the project was intended to be completed within two years, it took a decade. Many opposed it, focusing on political agendas rather than the countrys progress. This delay has cost us the opportunity to create numerous jobs. I am determined not to allow such setbacks in the future. I am committed to taking this country forward by properly implementing these development programs. This factory marks just one step in the broader development of Kuliyapitiya. With its opening, we begin the journey of growth for this region. We are creating a 1,000-acre investment zone in Bingiriya, and 500 acres have been allocated in Iranavila for a tourism zone. These areas will become hubs for both tourism and production. As we create new job opportunities, the demand for skilled workers will grow. To meet this, we plan to increase the number of engineers and skilled professionals. Were establishing the Faculty of Engineering at Kurunegala University to ensure that we keep pace with the demands of the 21st century. We cannot afford to fall behind. European companies are now joining Chinese companies in investing in these projects. They will remain engaged as we work through the process of officially exiting bankruptcy. We have had extensive discussions with the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank, and the 18 countries that have lent to Sri Lanka. Were now in the final stages of negotiations with private contractors, and we are progressing according to these agreements. I am determined to make the North West a hub of development, similar to the growth weve seen in Gampaha. This factory is just the beginning of that effort. I want to thank everyone involved, and I believe this company will play a vital role in strengthening our economy. --PMD--",

        "date": "September 17, 2024 10:03 pm",
        "content": "Hundreds of handheld pagers exploded near simultaneously across Lebanon and in parts of Syria on Tuesday, wounding members of the militant group Hezbollah, the Iranian ambassador and dozens of other people. Officials pointed the finger at Israel in what appeared to be a sophisticated, remote attack at a time of rising tensions across the Lebanon border. A Hezbollah official who spoke on condition of anonymity told The Associated Press that several hundred people, including members of the group, were wounded in different parts of Lebanon when their handheld pagers exploded. He said a few Hezbollah fighters were also wounded in Syria when the pagers they were carrying exploded, and said it was believed to be an Israeli attack. It wasnt immediately clear if people were killed. The Associated Press reached out to the Israeli military, which declined to comment. Irans semi-official Fars news agency, close to the countrys powerful Revolutionary Guard, said on its Telegram channel that Mojtaba Amani, Irans ambassador in Lebanon, has a superficial injury and is under observation at a hospital. Another semi-official Mehr news agency, also on its Telegram channel, reported that Amani was wounded by a pager explosion. Photos and videos from Beiruts southern suburbs circulating on social media and in local media showed people lying on the pavement with wounds on their hands or near their pants pockets. Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah previously warned the groups members not to carry cellphones, saying that they could be used by Israel to track their movements and to carry out targeted strikes. Lebanons Health Ministry called on all hospitals to be on alert to take in emergency patients and for people who own pagers to get away from them. It also asked health workers to avoid using wireless devices. AP photographers at area hospitals said the emergency rooms were overloaded with patients, many of them with injuries to their limbs, some in serious condition. The state-run National News Agency said hospitals in southern Lebanon, the eastern Bekaa Valley and Beiruts southern suburbs all areas where Hezbollah has a strong presence had called on people to donate blood of all types. The news agency reported that in Beiruts southern suburbs and other areas the handheld pagers system was detonated using advanced technology, and dozens of injuries were reported. The Hezbollah official who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the media said the explosions were the result of a security operation that targeted the devices. The enemy (Israel) stands behind this security incident, the official said, without elaborating. He added that the new pagers that Hezbollah members were carrying had lithium batteries that apparently exploded. Lithium batteries, when overheated, can smoke, melt and even catch on fire. Rechargeable lithium batteries are used in consumer products ranging from cellphones and laptops to electric cars. Lithium battery fires can burn up to 590 C (1,100 F). The incident comes at a time of heightened tensions between Lebanon and Israel. The Lebanese militant group Hezbollah and Israeli forces have been clashing near-daily for more than 11 months against the backdrop of war between Israel and Hezbollah ally Hamas in Gaza. The clashes have killed hundreds in Lebanon and dozens in Israel and displaced tens of thousands on both sides of the border. On Tuesday, Israel said that halting Hezbollahs attacks in the north to allow residents to return to their homes is now an official war goal. Israel has killed Hamas militants in the past with booby trapped cellphones and its widely believed to have been behind the Stuxnet computer virus attack on Irans nuclear program in 2010.

        "title": "Hezbollah vows retaliation against Israel after pager blasts kill several, wound 2,750 in Lebanon",
        "date": "September 18, 2024 07:27 am",
        "content": "Militant group Hezbollah promised to retaliate against Israel after accusing it of detonating pagers across Lebanon on Tuesday, killing nine people and wounding nearly 3,000 others, including fighters and Irans envoy to Beirut. Lebanese Information Minister Ziad Makary condemned the late-afternoon detonation of the pagers  handheld devices that Hezbollah and others in Lebanon use to send messages  as an Israeli aggression. Hezbollah said Israel would receive its fair punishment for the blasts. The Israeli military declined to comment on Reuters inquiries about the detonations. A senior Lebanese security source and another source told Reuters that Israels Mossad spy agency planted a small amount of explosives inside 5000 Taiwan-made pagers ordered by Hezbollah months before Tuesdays detonations. The senior Lebanese security source said the group had ordered 5,000 beepers made by Taiwan-based Gold Apollo, which several sources say were brought into the country in the spring. The senior Lebanese source also told Reuters that the devices had been modified by Israels spy service at the production level. Separately, a U.S. official told The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity that Israel briefed the U.S. on the operation  in which small amounts of explosive secreted in the pagers were detonated  on Tuesday after it had concluded. Israel and the Iran-backed Hezbollah have been engaged in cross-border warfare since the Gaza war erupted last October, in the worst such escalation in years. The pagers exploded in southern Lebanon, in Dahiyeh and the eastern Bekaa Valley, southern suburbs of Beirut that are known as Hezbollah strongholds. In one instance, closed-circuit surveillance video carried by regional broadcasters showed a person paying at a grocery store as what appeared to be a small, hand-held device placed next to the cashier exploded. Escalation in hostilities A Hezbollah official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the incident was the biggest security breach for the group in nearly a year of conflict with Israel. The Palestinian militant group Hamas, which is waging war with Israel in Gaza, said the pager blasts were an escalation that will only lead Israel to failure and defeat. United Nations special co-ordinator for Lebanon, Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert, deplored the attack in a statement and said it marked an extremely concerning escalation in the conflict. Washington said it was not involved in the explosions and did not know who was responsible. The United States renewed calls for a diplomatic solution to tensions between Israel and Lebanon and also urged Iran not to take advantage of any incident to raise instability. Iran, with its allies Hezbollah, Yemens Houthis and armed groups in Iraq, has formed an Axis of Resistance against Israeli and U.S. influence. Without commenting directly on the explosions in Lebanon, an Israeli military spokesperson said the chief of staff, Maj.-Gen. Herzi Halevi, met with senior officers on Tuesday evening to assess the situation. No policy change was announced, but he said that vigilance must continue to be maintained. Hezbollah fighters have been using pagers as a low-tech means of communication in an attempt to evade Israeli location-tracking, two sources familiar with the groups operations told Reuters this year. A pager is a wireless telecommunications device that receives and displays messages. Hezbollah has paid steep price in past year Irans ambassador to Lebanon, Mojtaba Amani, suffered a superficial injury in Tuesdays pager blasts and was under observation in hospital, Irans semi-official Fars news agency said. Reuters could not immediately confirm the report. The casualties included Hezbollah fighters who are the sons of top officials from the armed group, two security sources told Reuters. One of those killed was the son of a Hezbollah member of the Lebanese parliament, Ali Ammar, they said. This is not a security targeting of one, two or three people. This is a targeting of an entire nation, senior Hezbollah official Hussein Khalil said while paying his condolences for Ammars son. Tuesdays blasts added to a hefty price paid over the past year by Hezbollah. The group has lost more than 400 fighters in Israeli strikes, including its top commander, Fuad Shukr, in July. Security sources in Lebanon said two more Hezbollah fighters were killed in an Israeli strike in southern Lebanon on Tuesday. Earlier on Tuesday, Israels domestic security agency said it had foiled a plot by Hezbollah to assassinate a former senior defence official in the coming days. Hezbollah has said it wants to avoid all-out conflict with Israel, but that only an end to the Gaza war will stop the cross-border clashes. Gaza ceasefire efforts remain deadlocked after months of talks mediated by Qatar, Egypt and the U.S. While they saw a threat of escalation, experts were more skeptical, for now, about the potential for an imminent all-out Israel-Hezbollah war, which the U.S. has sought to prevent and which it believes neither side wants. Matthew Levitt, former deputy director of the U.S. Treasurys intelligence office and author of a book on Hezbollah, said the pager explosions could disrupt its operations for some time. Panic following explosions After Tuesdays blasts, ambulances rushed through the southern suburbs of Beirut amid widespread panic. At Mount Lebanon Hospital outside Beirut, a Reuters reporter saw motorcycles rushing to the emergency room and people with bloodied hands screaming in pain. The head of the Nabatieh public hospital in the south of the country, Hassan Wazni, told Reuters that about 40 wounded people were being treated at his facility. The wounds included injuries to the face, eyes and limbs. Hezbollah fired missiles at Israel immediately after the Oct. 7, 2023, attacks by Hamas gunmen on Israel that triggered the Gaza war. Hezbollah and Israel have been exchanging fire ever since, while avoiding a major escalation. Tens of thousands of people have been displaced from towns and villages on both sides of the border by the hostilities. On Tuesday, Israel added to its formal war goals the return of citizens to their homes near the border with Lebanon. Source: Reuters  The Associated Press --Agencies",
