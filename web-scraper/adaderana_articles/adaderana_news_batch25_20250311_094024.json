        "date": "July 20, 2024 06:25 pm",
        "content": "Minister of Sports Harin Fernando emphasized the need for modesty and discipline among national cricket players, suggesting that such behavior could mitigate the criticism they face after match losses. Speaking on the current state of the team, Minister Fernando highlighted certain deficiencies in the attitudes of modern players. Furthermore, he said: If the team had been more humble and their attitudes had shifted, the people of Sri Lanka would not have been so critical of match losses. People have a deep love for cricket. Meanwhile, Fernando pointed out that a new temporary coach has been appointed for the Sri Lankan team, claiming that the new coach has already implemented changes, including enforcing grooming standards such as haircuts. According to what I heard, the first thing he did was to cut everyones hair...and remove their earringsThe coach has taken significant steps to instill discipline right from the start, Fernando added. He also drew comparison with past cricket legends, stating players like Sanath Jayasuriya exhibited excellent discipline. There seems to be a slight lack of this quality in modern players. Former Sri Lankan cricketer Sanath Jayasuriya was recently appointed the interim head coach of Sri Lankan team after Chris Silverwood parted ways with the island nation in the aftermath of an unimpressive campaign at the ICC T20 World Cup 2024.",

        "title": "UN top court says Israeli occupation of Palestinian territories is illegal",
        "date": "July 20, 2024 07:22 pm",
        "content": "The UNs top court has said Israels occupation of Palestinian territories is against international law, in a landmark opinion. The International Court of Justice (ICJ) said Israel should stop settlement activity in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem and end its illegal occupation of those areas and the Gaza Strip as soon as possible. In response, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the court had made a decision of lies. The courts advisory opinion is not legally binding but still carries significant political weight. It marks the first time the ICJ has delivered a position on the legality of the 57-year occupation. The ICJ, based at The Hague in the Netherlands, has been examining the issue since the beginning of last year, at the request of the UN General Assembly. The court was specifically asked to give its view on Israels policies and practices towards the Palestinians, and on the legal status of the occupation. Delivering the courts findings, ICJ President Nawaf Salam said it had found that Israels... continued presence in the Occupied Palestinian Territory is illegal. The State of Israel is under the obligation to bring an end to its unlawful presence in the Occupied Palestinian Territory as rapidly as possible, he said. He said Israels withdrawal from the Gaza Strip in 2005 did not bring Israels occupation of that area to an end because it still exercises effective control over it. The court also said Israel should evacuate all of its settlers from the West Bank and East Jerusalem and pay reparations to Palestinians for damages caused by the occupation. Israel has built about 160 settlements housing some 700,000 Jews in the West Bank and East Jerusalem since 1967. The court said the settlements were illegal. Israel has consistently disputed that they are against international law. The ICJ said Israels policies and practices amount to annexation of large parts of the Occupied Palestinian Territory, which it said was against international law, adding that Israel was not entitled to sovereignty over any part of the occupied territories. Israel claims sovereignty over the whole of Jerusalem, the eastern half of which it captured in the 1967 Middle East war. It considers the city its indivisible capital - something which is not accepted by the vast majority of the international community. Among its other far-reaching conclusions, the court said Israeli restrictions on Palestinians in the occupied territories constituted systemic discrimination based on, inter alia, race, religion or ethnic origin. It also said Israel had illegally exploited the Palestinians natural resources and violated their right to self-determination. The court also advised states to avoid any actions, including providing aid or assistance, that would maintain the current situation. Israels prime minister swiftly issued a blunt statement rejecting what the court had determined. The Jewish people are not occupiers in their own land - not in our eternal capital Jerusalem, nor in our ancestral heritage of Judea and Samaria (the West Bank), Mr Netanyahu said in a statement. No decision of lies in The Hague will distort this historical truth, and similarly, the legality of Israeli settlements in all parts of our homeland cannot be disputed. But the courts findings were welcomed by the Palestinians. Hussein Al Sheikh, the secretary general of the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO), the Palestinians main umbrella group, called it a historic victory for the rights of the Palestinian people and their right to self-determination. And the collapse and defeat of the Judaization project through confiscation, settlement, displacement, and racist practices against a people under occupation. The international community must respect the opinion of international justice and force Israel to end its occupation of the Palestinian territories, he said. The courts findings will now go to the UN General Assembly, which will decide how to respond, including the option of adopting a resolution. That would be significant and could constitute a catalyst for negotiations and set the legal parameters for a future negotiated settlement. This case is separate from another active case brought to the ICJ by South Africa accusing Israel of committing genocide against the Palestinians in the war in Gaza. Source: BBC --Agencies",

        "title": "19A controversy: Jayampathy Wickramaratne responds to Presidents accusation",
        "date": "July 20, 2024 09:41 pm",
        "content": "Presidents Counsel Dr. Jayampathy Wickramaratne has revealed that during the drafting of the 19th Constitutional Amendment, the terms of the President and the Parliament were proposed to be reduced from six to five years, however, the decision was made to retain the possibility of extending these terms to six years, as any further changes would necessitate a referendum. Dr. Wickramaratne stated this in a statement released today (20) in response to the public apology made by President Ranil Wickremesinghe on Friday (19) for the alleged oversight involving the senior attorney. In his statement, Presidents Counsel Dr. Wickramaratne points out that the former government took the decision that the entire drafting process of the 19th Amendment should be carried out on the basis that the Bill should not be placed for approval at a referendum, in keeping with then President Maithripala Sirisenas electoral pledge. He added that while the terms of the President and Parliament were proposed to be reduced from six to five years, the upper limit of six years was not touched as that would require a referendum. In addition, he stated that Article 83 of the Constitution mandates that a Bill that seeks to amend or is inconsistent with particular Articles listed or the said upper limits would be required to be passed by a two-thirds majority in Parliament and approved by people at a referendum. He noted that it is essential to note that Article 83 itself is included in the list of provisions requiring a referendum. He further stated that several drafts prepared were all shared and discussed with the Cabinet sub-committee and the draft which was approved by the sub-committee was sent to the Legal Draftsman who took over as required by law and made some changes. The Presidents Counsel stated that then Prime Minister Wickremesinghe had several meetings with the Attorney General and several changes had to be made to the Bill because of the Attorney Generals stance. Accordingly, then Prime Minister Wickremesinghe presented the Bill to Parliament and when it was challenged in the Supreme Court, the Attorney General argued on behalf of the Government that no provision required a referendum. He stated that the clauses that the Supreme Court held to require a referendum were either amended or withdrawn in Parliament. Furthermore, in the statement, Dr. Wickremeratne stated that he regret that President Wickremesinghe had thought it fit to place the entire blame on him for not reducing the upper limits of the Presidents and Parliaments terms. He reiterated that the entire amendment process was based on avoiding a referendum following President Sirisenas pledge at the Presidential election. However, yesterday, during an inauguration event of a new court complex in Beligaha, Galle, President Wickremesinghe stated that not amending Article 83 of the 19th Amendment was a lapse on Dr. Jayampathy Wickramaratnes part, due to his inexperience in drafting constitutional amendments. In the meantime, Minister of Justice Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe said the President ordered the publication of the gazette with regard to the 22nd Amendment since it already received the parliament approval, and that it will not affect the upcoming presidential election. During a press conference held today, the Justice Minister stated that however, releasing a gazette publication in this background can lead to confusion and doubt among the citizens. That is the only issue we had, he added. My opinion is that the current situation is not suitable for this publication. However, President Ranil Wickremesinghes opinion was that publication could be done since we already had the approval of the Parliament, said Wijeyadasa. However, this new amendment wont affect the presidential elections and it will be held at the right time. This is not a critical situation that should cause any outrage, he said",

On July 09, police arrested seven suspects including the owner of the tattoo studio in Athurugiriya where the shooting incident took place, resulting in the deaths of Club Wasantha and another person and wounded four others. The other arrested individuals were suspected to have aided and abetted in the shooting incident. During the investigations carried out thus far, it has been revealed that the owner of the tattoo studio has received an amount of Rs. 1 million over a period of time. Meanwhile, measures have been taken to provide special protection to the owner of the tattoo studio in question, as per a court order, since there are accomplices of the criminal figure infamously known as Loku Patee, who is suspected to be involved in the incident, detained in the prison. Accordingly, it was reported that the suspect is currently being held under special security in another prison outside of Colombo. He has also requested permission to make a confidential statement to the Kaduwela Magistrate. Meanwhile, seven suspects including the tattoo studio owner arrested in connection with the shooting incident currently remain under remand custody. The shocking shooting incident had occurred during the opening ceremony of a tattoo and piercing studio near the Clock Tower in Athurugiriya on July 08 morning. Six people were rushed to the hospital following the incident. Police later confirmed that 55-year-old businessman Surendra Wasantha Perera, popularly known as Club Wasantha, and a 38-year-old male had succumbed to their injuries. Popular singer K.

Therefore, its important to highlight the net borrowing rather than the gross borrowing, he added.

        "content": "The Lunar Occultation of Saturn which is a rare astronomical event will be visible to Sri Lanka just after midnight on July 24, 2024. The Arthur C Clarke Institute for Modern Technologies said that the event will start at approximately 00:50 a.m. on 25 July, 2024 and will be visible to the naked eye by looking at the Moon starting around 00:40 a.m. on July 25, from Sri Lanka. Furthermore, Arthur C Clarke Institute added that a telescope or a pair of binoculars will enable the observation of the occultation-the disappearance and reappearance of Saturn, more clearly. In an occultation, one celestial body passes in front of another, blocking its view. When the Moon moves in front of Saturn, obscuring it from view on Earth, this event is known as the lunar occultation of Saturn. The Moon will obscure Saturn for approximately one hour and twenty minutes, and this phenomenon will only be visible from certain regions on Earth. In Sri Lanka, the time and duration of visibility for this event will slightly differ by location, it said. The next similar lunar occultation of Saturn visible from Sri Lanka will be on April 24, 2037.",

        "date": "July 21, 2024 11:34 am",
        "content": "Bangladesh extended a curfew on Sunday to control violent student-led protests that have killed at least 114 people, as authorities braced for a Supreme Court hearing later in the day on government job quotas that sparked the anger. Soldiers have been on patrol on the streets of capital Dhaka, the centre of the demonstrations that spiralled into clashes between protesters and security forces. Internet and text message services in Bangladesh have been suspended since Thursday, cutting the nation off as police cracked down on protesters who defied a ban on public gatherings. A curfew ordered late on Friday has been extended to 3 p.m. (0900 GMT) on Sunday, until after the Supreme Court hearing, and will continue for an uncertain time following a two-hour break for people to gather supplies, local media reported. Universities and colleges have also been closed since Wednesday. Nationwide unrest broke out following student anger against quotas for government jobs that included reserving 30 for the families of those who fought for independence from Pakistan. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasinas government had scrapped the quota system in 2018, but a court reinstated it last month. The Supreme Court suspended the decision after a government appeal and will hear the case on Sunday after agreeing to bring forward a hearing scheduled for Aug. 7. The demonstrations - the biggest since Hasina was re-elected for a fourth successive term this year - have also been fuelled by high unemployment among young people, who make up nearly a fifth of the population. The U.S. State Department on Saturday raised its travel advisory for Bangladesh to level four, urging American citizens to not travel to the South Asian country. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "title": "Sri Lankas fate would remain tragic even with LG polls amid economic recovery  President",
        "date": "July 21, 2024 12:04 pm",
        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe stated that if funds had been allocated to the local government elections, the country would have faced a tragic situation instead of focusing on economic recovery. The President emphasized that several critical areas needed funding priority over the elections. Despite these challenges, President Wickremesinghe highlighted that the countrys economy has been strengthened and moved forward on a solid foundation. President Wickremesinghe made these remarks while attending a meeting with former heads of local government institutions held today (20) at the Monarch Imperial Hotel, Sri Jayawardenepura Kotte. This meeting was organized in response to a request from local government representatives from across the island. President Ranil Wickremesinghe further stated: When I took over the country two years ago, it was facing multiple crises. There was not only an economic collapse but also a breakdown in law and politics. Even political parties were in disarray. When I was invited to take on the role of Prime Minister, I accepted it without hesitation. Before me, the opposition leader and other party leaders were invited, but none of them stepped up to accept the challenge. Once I accepted the challenge, I called upon all parties to unite in rebuilding the country. I first sought to discuss the situation with the President of the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP). However, the chairman of that party did not agree. I then engaged in discussions with former President Mahinda Rajapaksa. He stated that he would consult with his party and inform me of their decision. Subsequently, former President Rajapaksa and the SLPP announced their support for me. On the occasion, I also sought the support of the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB). However, its leader, Sajith Premadasa, stated that he would contest the parliamentary vote to elect the President. In the end, he did not run himself and instead nominated Dullas Alahapperuma. Despite this, a group of SJB members voted for me. I also engaged in discussions with the Tamil parties and other factions, securing their support as well. Upon becoming President, I faced numerous challenges. The economy had completely collapsed. The grassroots governance and political mechanisms were in disarray. At the rural level, there was an atmosphere where the houses of peoples representatives and activists could be set on fire, and they could be intimidated into taking to the streets. This situation was not limited to members of the SLPP but extended to members of other parties as well. If this continued, the rioters would seize power at the grassroots level, attempting to take control of villages. Gradually, I was able to steer the country forward by overcoming these challenges. Throughout this journey, we had to face protests and agitations, but we persevered. The local government election occurred against this backdrop. However, there were insufficient funds to allocate for it. Many issues needed prioritization over that election, such as allocating money for importing medicines and fuel. At that time, the Election Commission sought advice from Mr. Saliya Peiris P.C. without consulting the Attorney General regarding the local government election, which was a misguided action. Eventually, its members resigned, and a new team was appointed. I made it clear the truth then that there was no money in the country to hold local government elections. If I had not acted this way and held the election, neglecting economic development, the country would be in a much worse state today. If they had done that, would it have been possible to recover from the state of the country? Would it have been possible to allocate three times as much money to Aswesuma as to Samurdhi? Would it have been possible to implement the Urumaya free deeds program? If that had happened, we wouldnt have been able to do any of this. Somehow, we have been able to overcome these challenges and bring the countrys economy forward on a strong foundation. That is why people have money in their hands today. I wanted to provide some relief to the people who are suffering in the country. Accordingly, arrangements were made to give them Aswesuma. Ten kilos of rice were given to each household. Free land rights were obtained under the Urumaya programme. Ownership of the Housing are given to those who live in flats. Also, the agricultural modernization program has been started. The decentralized budget enabled us to allocate money for the implementation of development programs at the ground level. Due to these measures, the people have received relief today. On that day, a large number of people in the country announced that they would give their votes to the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP). But today that situation has changed. They are not even found today. Another part declared that they would vote for Sajith Premadasa. Today they are also silent. Due to the strong program we have launched, they have not been able to go among the people. They have not been able to face the program that we have created. They have no answers. But our program is still in the beginning. We accept that injustice has been done to all of you gathered here today. We have planned to discuss this issue with the Attorney General. Anyway, we will take steps to remove the current ban after the upcoming elections. Election cannot be held after a year has passed since the submission of nominations. Newcomers should also be given the opportunity to compete. I remember accepting nominations for the local government elections in 1988. But during that time, due to the revolt of the JVP, all those nominations were cancelled and nominations were called again. In this way, we will act in the future to do justice to all of you. A good situation has been created for you today to reach the people at the grassroots. Take the advantage of it and go among the people and speak the truth with them. Take steps to increase peoples understanding of the bitter journey we have come through. You can do it. The JVP or the SJB do not have a clear plan or vision to solve the problems in the country and build a better future for the people. People have now realized the deception they are leading. You cannot move a country forward with lies. We should see how to develop Sri Lanka in the way that countries like Singapore and Japan have progressed. The political system should be built in a way that is suitable for the country. There may be several parties, but the goal should be one. There may be times when political parties work together as well as when they work separately. But it should also be possible to work together within one framework. Another major problem in this country today is creating job opportunities for the youth who are suffering from unemployment. Among those activities, the poor people of the country, who make up about 25, cannot be forgotten. We have to act to save the people from that situation. There are various economic programs for that. We should implement them and work in a planned manner to reduce the number of poor people at the rural level. We have already passed the Womens Empowerment Act and took steps to increase the representation of women. Additionally, the proposal to hold the provincial council election using the old system was submitted by MP Sumanthiran. I have no objection on that proposal, but we have informed that womens representation should be included as well. JVP and SJB have been organizing their activities for the presidential election for about six months now. They have been running for about a year. They need more life. Let us start our work on time. I have no doubt we will win. Minister of Urban Development and Housing Prasanna Ranatunga, All the political parties leading the government, including the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna, hold a discussion every Monday. During one such meeting, President Ranil Wickremesinghe requested Mr. Basil Rajapaksa to arrange a meeting with local government representatives. The President believes in maintaining the partys identity and moving forward with it. Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa also valued the support of local government members. When former President Mahinda Rajapaksa was defeated in 2015, it was the local government councillors who worked tirelessly to restore him to power. Recognizing their crucial role, President Wickremesinghe has also sought to meet with local government representatives to hear their views. Their support is essential for the President to secure victory in the upcoming elections, as local government representatives have always contributed significantly to the country. State Minister Janaka Wakkambura, Two years ago, on a day like today, we placed our trust in President Ranil Wickremesinghe by casting 134 votes in Parliament to elect him. We appointed you with the support of the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna because we believed in your ability to lead the country democratically. Today, you have created an environment where political activity can flourish, and you have also steered the country away from economic bankruptcy. The President has never made false promises. When he commits to something, he delivers, demonstrating the qualities of a seasoned political leader. You have lived up to our expectations and preserved the trust we placed in you. We extend our gratitude and respect for your leadership. You have taught us valuable political lessons on decision-making. When I was appointed as the State Minister of Local Government, local government elections were imminent, and the country was in a difficult situation. Around 90,000 nominations were submitted, but many of the political parties involved no longer exist, and some of the nominees have left the country. Despite numerous challenges, you ensured that the jobs of approximately 8,400 local government employees were secured. Your intervention helped them achieve permanent employment with pensions. You also addressed deficiencies in the Ministry of Local Government with promptness and decisiveness. Thanks to your bold leadership, we now have a conducive environment for holding political elections. As local government representatives, you should work diligently to support President Ranil Wickremesinghe and ensure that he has the opportunity to continue his work in the next 05 years. Member of Parliament Mr. Vajira Abeywardena, As President Ranil Wickremesinghe has mentioned, the country is forging a new path. You have supported the national leader, Ranil Wickremesinghe, not based on political party affiliations, but out of a significant personal sacrifice. You have lost your homes, properties, and even future political opportunities in the process. For this, we offer our deepest respect and gratitude. Two years ago today, leaders and MPs from various parties, including the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna, elected Mr. Ranil Wickremesinghe as the eighth executive president with 134 parliamentary votes. Although the United National Party had long strived for this, it was achieved through your efforts. We must acknowledge this accomplishment. President Wickremesinghe is known for his gratitude, so we must proceed carefully. The presidential election is due before October 17. As we prepare, some concerns and questions need addressing. Some claim that the election may be postponed due to a lack of campaign slogans or suggest that the 22nd Amendment aims to delay the election. However, Article 83 of the Constitution is clear: it does not impact the presidential election. The proposed constitutional amendment is meant to correct past errors. United, we can ensure that this presidential election will be a historic victory for Sri Lanka. The event was attended by Minister Harin Fernando, State Minister Arundika Fernando, Members of Parliament, Attorney-at-Law Premanath C. Dolawatta, Attorney-at-Law Madhura Withanage, Secretary General of the United National Party Palitha Range Bandara, former mayor Nandana Gunathilaka, and representatives from Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna, United National Party, Sri Lanka Freedom Party, as well as other former Mayors, Deputy Mayors, Chairmen, Vice Presidents, and other officials. --PMD",

Speaking to the Media, the State Minister emphasized that following the completion of second review to release the third tranche of the IMF bailout package, the country must prepare for the third review. However, he said that the discussions to be held with the IMF delegation next week is not related to the third review, but to focus on the countrys economic progress and future actions to be taken to strengthen the economy. Semasinghe further stated: Our expectation is to maintain the current stability and economic growth rate of 5.1 in the first quarter of this year throughout the year. Most forecasts expect 2 growth in the economy this year. But we expect it to be maintained between 3 and 3.5 this year.

        "title": "Bangladeshs top court scales back discriminatory job quota system after deadly protests",
        "date": "July 21, 2024 02:57 pm",
        "content": "Bangladeshs top court on Sunday scaled back a controversial quota system for government job applicants after it led to nationwide unrest and deadly clashes between police and protesters that have killed scores of people. The Supreme Court in its verdict ordered 93 of the government jobs to be allocated on a merit-based system, leaving the remaining 7 for relatives of veterans who fought in Bangladeshs war of independence in 1971 and other categories. Earlier, the system reserved 30 of such jobs to the relatives of war veterans. Sundays verdict comes after weeks of demonstrations  mostly led by students  that turned deadly on Tuesday after protesters began clashing with police. During the week, police fired tear gas and rubber bullets and hurled smoke grenades to scatter stone-throwing protesters who filled the streets and university campuses. Sporadic clashes in some parts of Dhaka, the capital, were reported on Saturday but it was not immediately clear whether there were any fatalities. Bangladeshi authorities havent shared any official numbers of those killed and injured, but the Daily Prothom Alo newspaper reported Saturday that at least 103 people have died so far. Ahead of the courts hearing, soldiers patrolled cities across the South Asian country, while a nationwide curfew and an internet blackout continued to remain in force. Home Minister Asaduzzaman Khan said the curfew will be relaxed from 3 p.m. to 5 p.m. on Sunday for people to run essential errands. Meanwhile, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasinas government has declared Sunday and Monday as public holidays, with only emergency services allowed to operate. The chaos highlights cracks in Bangladeshs governance and economy and the frustration of young people who lack good jobs upon graduation. It also represents the biggest challenge to Hasina since she won a fourth consecutive term in office after Januarys elections, which were boycotted by the main opposition groups. Protesters argue the quota system is discriminatory and benefits supporters of Hasina, whose Awami League party led the independence movement, saying it should be replaced with a merit-based system. Hasina has defended the quota system, saying that veterans deserve the highest respect for their contributions in the war against Pakistan, regardless of their political affiliation. Representatives from both sides met late Friday in an attempt to reach a resolution and Law Minister Anisul Huq said the government was open to discussing their demands. The demands included the reform of the current quota system, the reopening of student dormitories shut by the police following the clashes and for some university officials to step down after failing to protect campuses from the violence. The main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party has backed the protests, vowing to organize its own demonstrations as many of its supporters have joined the student-led protests. However, BNP said in a statement its followers were not responsible for the violence and denied the ruling partys accusations of using the protests for political gains. The Awami League and the BNP have often accused each other of fueling political chaos and violence, most recently ahead of the countrys national election, which was marred by a crackdown on several opposition figures. Hasinas government had accused the opposition party of attempting to disrupt the vote. In 2018, the government halted the job quotas following mass student protests. But in June, Bangladeshs High Court nullified that decision and reinstated the quotas after relatives of 1971 veterans filed petitions. The Supreme Court suspended the ruling, pending an appeal hearing. Hasina has called on protesters to wait for the courts verdict. Source: AP --Agencies",

        "title": "President affirms support for expatriate workers to live with dignity upon return",
        "date": "July 21, 2024 03:57 pm",
        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe announced plans to ensure returning migrant workers can live with dignity after completing their service abroad. He thanked these workers for their vital contributions of foreign exchange during the recent economic crisis, acknowledging their crucial role in advancing the countrys economy. The President made these remarks while addressing the inauguration ceremony of the Wigamanika Harasara initiative, held today (21) at the Sathyawadi Ground in Kurunegala. This initiative aims to recognize the impact of migrant workers on the Sri Lankan economy. To assess the contribution of migrant workers to Sri Lankas economy, the Wigamanika Harasara program was launched across the country, beginning in the North West Province. Approximately 5,000 migrants from the Kurunegala, Puttalam, Anuradhapura, Matale, and Kegalle districts participated in this initiative. During the event, the President also awarded Rs.50, 000 each to migrant workers as seed capital to support their self-employment ventures under a welfare benefits program managed by the Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment (SLBFE). This initiative aims to empower the migrant community economically and socially, confirm their rights, and gather ideas and proposals for policy development. The President took the opportunity to personally engage with migrant workers, inquiring about their well-being and participating in friendly conversations. Addressing the gathering, President Ranil Wickremesinghe further elaborated; The government has provided support to migrant workers returning after earning foreign exchange to help them start a new chapter in their lives. This support is not a reward or grant, but a right earned through their dedicated service. Many returning individuals may find their old jobs no longer suitable for their aspirations, and this program is designed to assist those with the drive and determination to forge a new path. I encourage you to make the most of this opportunity. During the countrys economic crisis, your contributions of foreign exchange were crucial for our recovery. Without such support, our economy would not have been able to stabilize. When I took over, the country was in severe decline, with shortages of fuel, fertilizer, and a bleak future ahead. In those early months, we faced numerous challenges. Without the money you sent, we would not have been able to navigate these difficulties. Thanks to timely provision of fertilizers, we achieved a successful harvest in recent seasons, which has significantly advanced the economy of our country. Every dollar you sent was invaluable, and I extend my gratitude to all of you. Your contributions enabled us to celebrate the Sinhala New Year, Vesak, and Poson festivals with great success. We must continue to advance and develop our country, as relying on loans alone cannot sustain our economy. While we have received concessions to help repay foreign loans, merely servicing the debt is insufficient. We need to boost our foreign exchange reserves, which require borrowing until we reach our target amount. However, this increases our debt, so efforts must focus on enhancing our foreign exchange inflow. Formal training for those seeking foreign employment is essential. I have advised the minister to develop a program that equips returning workers with advanced professional skills. Additionally, we should shift towards an export-driven economy, attract foreign investments, and increase tourism. This new approach will guide our country toward further development. We also need to focus on advancing agriculture in the country, particularly by increasing paddy production. To support this, we have initiated an agricultural modernization program. As a country, we must move forward with confidence. While large-scale companies are attracting more investors, which are promising, my goal is to also uplift the common people. We have launched programs to address this. The Aswesuma and Urumaya programs have been introduced to ensure that everyone in the country receives their rights. Additionally, Rs.50 billion has been allocated to provide essential loans for small and medium-sized businesses. This initiative is part of our broader effort to foster ground-level progress as the country develops. In building an export-driven economy, it is crucial for individuals to focus on their villages economic development as well. While we are committed to national economic growth, we are also providing support for local development. The future of our country is at stake, and there is no room for complacency. Politics should not be about false promises or superficial interactions; its about making informed decisions for the future. I remind you of the important responsibility you hold in this process. Manusha Nanayakkara, Minister of Labour and Foreign Employment; Sri Lanka has been able to stand strong as a country because of its foreign employees. In 2019, foreign workers sent USD 6.1 billion to Sri Lanka. By 2022, this amount had decreased to USD 3 billion. However, this year, these dedicated individuals have already sent USD 12 billion, bolstering the program led by President Ranil Wickremesinghe. Despite attempts by some political leaders to deter them from sending money for political reasons, these national heroes have remained committed. President Ranil Wickremesinghes economic programs have successfully encouraged foreign workers to resume sending money to Sri Lanka, providing the necessary foreign exchange for the countrys basic needs. The government has introduced several special initiatives to support these workers, such as offering vehicle licenses, gifts, and certificates to those who have travelled abroad more than six times. These programs aim to recognize and honour migrant workers. Additionally, the government is working to provide the facilities needed to help migrant workers become entrepreneurs. We extend our heartfelt gratitude for your invaluable service. Jagath Pushpakumara, State Minister for Labour and Foreign Employment; There was a time when this country faced war, and the soldiers made great sacrifices to save it. In 2022, Sri Lanka faced another kind of waran economic one. Farmers took to the streets due to a lack of fertilizer, there were fourteen-hour power cuts, and people protested in the streets without fuel and gas. The struggle that began from there was exploited by opportunists, leading to the destruction of state property. Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa resigned, and groups from the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) invited Sajith Premadasa to become Prime Minister. Sajith Premadasa declined, citing his inability to accept those challenges after serving as president for five years. A parliamentary group then approached Anura Kumara Dissanayake, who said the President must also be requested to step down for him to take over. However, President Ranil Wickremesinghe took over the country without any conditions, pledging to free the people from oppression. Your support as patriots in economically rebuilding the country today is highly commendable. Look at Bangladesh today. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina won 224 out of 300 parliamentary seats in the last election. The defeated political groups and the student movement have begun a struggle together. A similar incident happened in Sri Lanka two years ago. Some people are trying to set the country on fire and seize power. People are urged to make informed decisions regarding this matter. Governor of North Western Province, Naseer Ahamed Zainulabdeen; Due to the severe economic crisis faced by the country two years ago, the future had become uncertain. President Ranil Wickremesinghe took charge, placing faith in the migrant workers and implementing an economic program. Today, this program has made significant progress. Foreign reserves have increased to 20 billion, and efforts have been made to reduce inflation. Negotiations with creditor countries have successfully reduced Sri Lankas debt by USD 8 billion. President Ranil Wickremesinghe is the only political leader capable of achieving such a feat. State Minister of Livestock, D B Herath; The Ministry of Labour and Foreign Employment has worked diligently to align the foreign workforce in a way that benefits the country. The contributions of these migrant workers in helping the country navigate a severe two-year economic crisis are invaluable. When President Ranil Wickremesinghe assumed the presidency with 134 votes in the Parliament, the country was in a state of disarray. These migrant workers, who believed in the Presidents program, have been sending remittances back to Sri Lanka, significantly aiding the countrys economic recovery. We anticipate their continued support will strengthen our progress. Former Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam; Today, your family is living abroad for Sri Lanka. While your family is abroad, the government is implementing programs to support and strengthen you. A new initiative has been introduced to help you navigate the economic crisis. Efforts have been made to provide relief through the Aswesuma and Urumaya programs. I urge you to use this relief to improve your situation. State Minister Shantha Bandara, Secretary to the Ministry of Labour and Foreign Employment R P A Wimalaweera, and other officials attended the event. --PMD",

        "title": "Ernest Hemingway fans celebrate the authors 125th birthday in his beloved Key West",
        "date": "July 21, 2024 05:36 pm",
        "content": "Ernest Hemingway spent the 1930s in Key West, Florida, and more than six decades after his death, fans, scholars and relatives continue to congregate on the island city to celebrate the authors award-winning novels and adventure-filled life. Hemingway Days started in 1981 with a short-story competition and a look-alike contest. This years celebration concludes Sunday on the 125th anniversary of Hemingways birth on July 21, 1899. As a novelist, short-story writer and journalist, Hemingways spot in the pantheon of American literature is undeniable and his legacy permeates the culture and character of Key West. Hemmingways great-grandson, Stephen Hemingway Adams, was born nearly three decades after Hemingway died. Adams said working with his grandfather, Patrick Hemingway, who was Ernest Hemingways second son, helped him gain a deeper understanding of his famous ancestor. I got to work with my granddad, and we put out a book called Dear Papa, which was all of the letters between Ernest and my grandfather, Adams said. The difference between the public perception and the documented reality of Hemingway can be fuzzy. He loved big-game fishing in the Caribbean and hunting in Africa. He loved bullfighting, baseball, boxing and barhopping. But he also was a serious artist who won Pulitzer and Nobel prizes. He put so much of his life experiences into his writing that it can be tricky to separate the man from the myth. Adams said hes fine with some people loving the adventurer more than the writer. I think its a split, and I think thats whats fun, Adams said of the throngs of look-alikes who visit Key West every year. The Key West that Hemingway first visited in 1928 was a rustic fishing village, not a bustling tourist destination. Hemingway and his second wife, Pauline, had only planned a brief stop to pick up a car during their move from Paris to Arkansas, where Paulines family lived. But the car wasnt ready and they had to wait several weeks. Hemingway quickly made friends with local business owners and fishermen. The couple made frequent visits to the island and eventually bought a French Colonial home on a 1.5-acre (0.61-hectare) lot in 1931. After spending most of his 20s in Paris, Hemingway embraced the vastly different island lifestyle, according to Cori Convertito, a curator at Key West Museum of Art  History at the Custom House. He doesnt come here to act like a recluse and just write, Convertito said. Hes out at the bars all the time. Hes out fishing with people. Hes interacting in boxing matches. Convertito pointed out that Hemingway was in his 30s for most of the time he lived in Key West, not the white-bearded Papa Hemingway most look-alike contestants emulate. A Farewell to Arms was finished shortly after he began visiting Key West and that books reception, along with his coverage of the Spanish Civil War in the late 1930s, increased his fame. Much of Hemingways time in Key West was devoted to big-game fishing with friends. Convertito said Hemingway began to pioneer new techniques after getting his own boat, the Pilar, in 1934. He was desperate to land a fully intact marlin, Convertito said. The slow process of reeling in a trophy fish left them vulnerable to sharks, similar to the giant marlin caught in Hemingways 1952 novel, The Old Man and the Sea. Hemingway focused on catching fish and removing them from the water quickly. He was an early member of the International Game Fish Association and named a vice president in 1940. He also became an advocate for the Florida Keys and the people who lived there. To Have and Have Not, which was published in 1937, is set in a Key West ravaged by the Great Depression. Hemingway was a vocal critic of how the federal government responded to the 1935 Labor Day hurricane. The official death toll was 423, but more than 250 of the fatalities were World War I veterans hired through a federal jobs program to build the Overseas Highway, which connects the Florida Keys to mainland Florida. Hemingway drove an ambulance during World War I and felt a particular kinship with the veterans. Corey Malcom, a historian with the Florida Keys History Center, said Hemingway joined the recovery efforts and used his own boat to pull bodies out of the ocean. Michael Morawski, CEO of the Hemingway Home  Museum, credits his great-aunt, Bernice Dixon, as one of the first people to help preserve Hemingways legacy in Key West. The local jewelry store owner bought the house for 80,000 in 1961, shortly after Hemingways death. The home became a museum in 1964 and eventually was designated a National Historic Landmark. The only reason that she did it was to create a living memorial to Ernest Hemingway, Morawski said. Besides the historical and literary significance of the home, the museum also is famous for housing the Hemingway cats. About 60 polydactyl cats with a genetic mutation for extra toes continue to live at the estate. Some of these cats are descendants of the original white, six-toed cat that Hemingway was gifted from a ships captain. The Hemingway Days festival started as a promotional stunt for Sloppy Joes Bar, one of Hemingways favorite hangouts. Michael Whalton was working as a manager at the bar in 1980 when he read about a Bad Hemingway Contest, where writers parodied Hemingways sparse, blunt style. Whalton decided a look-alike contest and other activities around Hemingways July birthday might be a great way to attract costumers during the islands slow season, when hot and humid weather scares many tourists away. I really didnt know what to expect, Whalton said. I was getting nervous because we didnt have anybody signed up for the look-alike contest, so I called everybody I knew in Key West who had a beard. The turnout was better than expected. The authors younger brother, Leicester Hemingway, contacted Whalton and agreed to judge the look-alike contest with his wife and daughters. Whalton convinced another granddaughter of Ernest Hemingway, Lorian Hemingway, to judge a short story contest. David Douglas, president of the Hemingway Look-Alike Society, began attending the competition in 2000 and won in 2009. The 70-year-old Houston resident continues to return every year as a judge. I love the contest, I love the camaraderie all the contestants, Douglas said. David Bat Masterson, of Daytona Beach, became the newest Papa on Saturday. The retired pilot beat out 121 others in this years look-alike contest. The look-alike group has evolved over the years into a service organization with hundreds of members around the world that has funded more than 350,000 in scholarships for Florida Keys students. The organization also sponsors a youth baseball team in Cuba, where Hemingway moved after leaving Florida. Source: AP --Agencies",

        "content": "A global tech outage that was related to a software update by cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike affected nearly 8.5 million Microsoft devices, Microsoft said in a blog post on Saturday. We currently estimate that CrowdStrikes update affected 8.5 million Windows devices, or less than one percent of all Windows machines, it said in the blog. A software update by global cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike, one of the largest operators in the industry, triggered systems problems that grounded flights, forced broadcasters off air and left customers without access to services such as healthcare or banking. While the percentage was small, the broad economic and societal impacts reflect the use of CrowdStrike by enterprises that run many critical services, Microsoft said in its blog post. CrowdStrike has helped develop a solution that will help Microsofts Azure infrastructure accelerate a fix, Microsoft said, adding that it was working with Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud Platform, sharing information about the effects Microsoft was seeing across the industry. The air travel industry was recovering on Saturday from the outage that caused thousands of flights to be cancelled, leaving passengers stranded or grappling with hours of delays as airports and airlines were caught up in the IT outage. Delta Air Lines , one of the hardest-hit airlines, said that as of 10 a.m EDT (1400 GMT) on Saturday, more than 600 flights had been canceled, adding that additional cancellations were expected.

        "date": "July 21, 2024 10:02 pm",
        "content": "Israel said it shot down a missile launched from Yemen on Sunday and the Yemeni Houthi movement said it had fired several missiles at the Israeli city of Eilat after Israels first public strike against the Iran-aligned group a day earlier. The Houthis have launched missiles and drones at Israel and disrupted global trade through the Red Sea in response to Israels assault on Gaza, further destabilising the Middle East as war in the Palestinian enclave rages on after nine months. Israel says the Houthis have launched 200 attacks against it since the Gaza war began, many of them intercepted and most of them not deadly. But a rare Houthi drone strike on Friday hit Tel Aviv and killed one person, prompting Israel to announce its first strikes against the group on Saturday. The strikes by warplanes hit near the Yemeni port of Hodeidah and killed six people, local medics said. The Houthi movement, known formally as Ansar Allah, said on Sunday it would continue to attack Israel in response. Houthi spokesperson Mohammed Abdulsalam told Qatars Al Jazeera TV there would be no red lines ... all sensitive institutions ... will be a target for us. The Israeli military said its Arrow 3 missile defence system had shot down a surface-to-surface missile projectile launched from Yemen on Sunday before it crossed into Israeli territory. Before the interception, air raid sirens sounded in the Red Sea port city of Eilat, sending residents running for shelter. Sundays attack prolonged an escalation of violence between Israel and the Houthis that began with the Houthi drone strike that hit the centre of Tel Aviv on Friday. One man was killed and four other people were wounded, officials said. The Israeli warplanes air raid on Hodeidah on Saturday killed six people and wounded more than 80, medical sources in Yemen told Reuters, describing all as civilians. Images from the scene showed a fiery blaze and dense smoke rising from the site of the strike. A Houthi-run TV channel said the strikes had hit an oil facility and power station. Israeli officials say Hodeidah port has been used by the Houthis to receive weapons shipments from Iran. PROXY BATTLE The exchanges are part of a spillover from the Gaza war that has drawn in regional and world powers. Iran-aligned groups including the Houthis have fired rockets and missiles at Israel saying they are doing so in support of Palestinians and the Islamist militant group Hamas that governs Gaza. The United States and its allies back Israel and provide weapons to it. The war began on Oct. 7 after a Hamas-led attack on southern Israel in which about 1,200 people were killed and over 250 taken hostage back to Gaza, according to Israeli authorities. Israel has since bombed and invaded Gaza as part of what it says is a campaign to eliminate Hamas, killing nearly 39,000 people, according to health officials in the enclave. The Houthis, who control much of the north of Yemen and other large population centres, have previously claimed targeting Eilat and other attacks directed at Israel, saying they are acting in retaliation for Israels war on Gaza. The group has also attacked Red Sea shipping routes for months. Hamas allies include Iran-backed groups such as the Houthis, Hezbollah in Lebanon and Iraqi paramilitaries. The Houthi movement consists primarily of members a minority Shiite Muslim group in Yemen and has controlled the countrys capital, Sanaa, for years. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "title": "US President Joe Biden drops out of 2024 presidential race, endorses Kamala Harris",
        "date": "July 22, 2024 12:12 am",
        "content": "President Joe Biden dropped out of the 2024 race for the White House on Sunday, ending his bid for reelection following a disastrous debate with Donald Trump that raised doubts about his fitness for office just four months before the election. The decision comes after escalating pressure from Bidens Democratic allies to step aside following the June 27 debate, in which the 81-year-old president trailed off, often gave nonsensical answers and failed to call out the former presidents many falsehoods. Biden endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris to take on Trump, and encouraged his party to united behind her. Biden plans to serve out the remainder of his term in office, which ends at noon ET on Jan. 20, 2025. It has been the greatest honor of my life to serve as your President. And while it has been my intention to seek reelection, I believe it is in the best interest of my party and the country for me to stand down and to focus solely on fulfilling my duties as President for the remainder of my term, Biden wrote in a letter posted to his X account. Nearly 30 minutes later, Biden threw his support behind Harris, the partys instant favorite for the nomination at its August convention in Chicago. Today I want to offer my full support and endorsement for Kamala to be the nominee of our party this year, he said in another post on X. Democrats  its time to come together and beat Trump. Bidens decision came as he has been isolating at his Delaware beach house after being diagnosed with COVID-19 last week, huddling with a shrinking circle of close confidants and family members about his political future. Biden said he would address the nation later this week to provide detail about his decision. The White House confirmed the authenticity of the letter. The announcement is the latest jolt to a campaign for the White House that both political parties see as the most consequential election in generations, coming just days after the attempted assassination of Trump at a Pennsylvania rally. A partys presumptive presidential nominee has never stepped out of the race so close to the election. The closest parallel would be President Lyndon Johnson who, besieged by the Vietnam War, announced in March 1968 that he would not seek another term. Now, Democrats have to urgently try to bring coherence to the nominating process in a matter of weeks and persuade voters in a stunningly short amount of time that their nominee can handle the job and beat Trump. And for his part, Trump must shift his focus to a new opponent after years of training his attention on Biden. The decision marks a swift and stunning end to Bidens 52 years in electoral politics, as donors, lawmakers and even aides expressed to him their doubts that he could convince voters that he could plausibly handle the job for another four years. Biden won the vast majority of delegates and every nominating contest but one, which would have made his nomination a formality. Now that he has dropped out, those delegates will be free to support another candidate. Harris, 59, appeared to be the natural successor, in large part because she is the only candidate who can directly tap into the Biden campaigns war chest, according to federal campaign finance rules. Bidens backing helps clear the way for Harris, but a smooth transition is by no means assured. The Democratic National Convention is scheduled to be held Aug. 19-22 in Chicago, but the party had announced that it would hold a virtual roll call to formally nominate Biden before in-person proceedings begin. It remained to be seen whether other candidates woul challenge Harris for the nomination or how party may need to adjust its rules again to smooth Harris nomination on the floor. Trumps campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Bidens decision to leave the race, but he and his team had made their preference for facing Biden clear. Nonetheless, his team has ramped up its attacks on Harris as pressure on Biden to step down intensified. Democratic officials, including many who were behind the effort to push Biden from the race, quickly released statements praising Bidens decision. His decision of course was not easy, but he once again put his country, his party, and our future first, said Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. Joe, today shows you are a true patriot and great American. In 2020, Biden pitched himself as a transitional figure who wanted to be a bridge to a new generation of leaders. But once he secured the job he spent decades struggling to attain, he was reluctant to part with it. Biden was once asked whether any other Democrats could beat Trump. Probably 50 of them, Biden replied. No, Im not the only one who can defeat him, but I will defeat him. Biden is already the countrys oldest president and had insisted repeatedly that he was up for the challenge of another campaign and another term, telling voters all they had to was watch me. And watch him they did. His poor debate performance prompted a cascade of anxiety from Democrats and donors who said publicly what some had said privately for months, that they did not think he was up to the job for four more years. Concerns over Bidens age have dogged him since he announced he was running for reelection, though Trump is just three years younger at 78. Most Americans view the president as too old for a second term, according to an August 2023 poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. A majority also doubt his mental capability to be president, though that is also a weakness for Trump. Biden often remarked that he was not as young as he used to be, doesnt walk as easily or speak as smoothly, but that he had wisdom and decades of experience, which were worth a whole lot. I give you my word as a Biden. I would not be running again if I didnt believe with all my heart and soul I can do this job, he told supporters at a rally in North Carolina a day after the debate. Because, quite frankly, the stakes are too high. But voters had other problems with him, too  he has been deeply unpopular as a leader even as his administration steered the nation through recovery from a global pandemic, presided over a booming economy and passed major pieces of bipartisan legislation that will impact the nation for years to come. A majority of Americans disapprove of the way hes handling his job, and hes faced persistently low approval ratings on key issues including the economy and immigration. Bidens age surfaced as a major factor during an investigation of his handling of classified documents. Special counsel Robert Hur said in February that the president came across in interviews with investigators as a sympathetic, well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory. The presidents allies seized on the statement as gratuitous and criticized Hur for including it in his report, and Biden himself angrily pushed back on descriptions of how he spoke about his late son. Bidens motivation for running was deeply intertwined with Trump. He had retired from public service following eight years serving as vice president under Barack Obama and the death of his son Beau but decided to run after Trumps comments following a Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2017, when white supremacists descended on the city to protest the removal of its Confederate memorials. Trump said: You had some very bad people in the group, but you also had people that were very fine people on both sides. On both sides. That a sitting president didnt unequivocally condemn racism and white supremacy deeply offended Biden. Then, Biden won the 2020 election and Trump refused to concede and stood by for hours while his supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, beating and bloodying law enforcement in a failed attempt to overturn the certification of Bidens win. If Trump wasnt running, Im not sure Id be running, Biden once said during at a campaign event. Bidens wife, first lady Jill Biden, responded to the presidents announcement by reposting Bidens letter announcing his decision and adding red heart emojis. Granddaughter Naomi Biden Neal said on social media that Im nothing but proud of my Pop. She said he has served the country with every bit of his soul and with unmatched distinction and that our world is better today in so many ways thanks to him. Source: AP --Agencies",

        "content": "Health authorities in Indias Kerala state have issued an alert after a 14-year-old boy died of the Nipah virus. According to the states health minister, an additional 60 people have been identified as being in the high-risk category of having the disease. Kerala Health Minister Veena George said the boy was from the town of Pandikkad and that those who came into contact with him have been isolated and tested. People in the area have been asked to take precautions such as wearing masks in public areas and refraining from visiting people in hospital. The Nipah virus infection is a zoonotic illness transmitted from animals like pigs and fruit bats to humans, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). It can also be transmitted through contaminated food and through contact with an infected person. The WHO has described the virus as a priority pathogen by the WHO because of its potential to trigger an epidemic. The virus has been linked to dozens of deaths in Kerala state since it was first reported there in 2018. The 14-year-old died on Sunday, just a day after he was confirmed to have the virus, according to Indian media reports. It can also be transmitted through contaminated food and through contact with an infected person. Parts of Kerala are said to be the most at-risk globally for the virus. An investigation published by Reuters last year found that Kerala, which is a tropical state and is witnessing rapid urbanisation and rapid tree loss, created ideal conditions for a virus like Nipah to emerge. Experts say that due to habitat loss, animals are living in closer proximity to humans and this helps the virus jump from animals to humans. The state government recently announced that it was creating an action plan to prevent a Nipah outbreak. Last year, authorities in Kerala state closed schools and offices after confirming five cases.

        "content": "The Colombo High Court has ordered Bodu Bala Sena (BBS) General Secretary Ven. Galagodaaththe Gnanasara Thero to be released on bail, as per a recent order issued by the Court of Appeal. This order was issued by Colombo High Court judge Adithya Patabendige this morning (22), Ada Derana reporter said. On July 18, 2024, the Court of Appeal granted bail for Ven. Galagodaaththe Gnanasara Thero, who had been sentenced to four years of rigorous imprisonment for making defamatory comments on Islam at Kuragala, until the hearing of the revision petition filed by him. Accordingly, the Thero was ordered to be released on a monetary bail of Rs 50,000 and two surety bail of Rs 500,000 each. Additionally, the Appeals Court imposed an overseas travel ban on Ven. Galagodaaththe Gnanasara Thero and ordered the Colombo High Court to communicate that to the Immigration and Emigration Controller. On March 28, 2024, the Colombo High Court sentenced Gnanasara Thero to four years of rigorous imprisonment while imposing a fine of Rs. 100,000, over the defamatory comments made against Islam during a 2016 media briefing convened on the Kuragala Buddhist monastery, causing damage to national and religious harmony. The judge found the monk guilty of the two indictments filed by the Attorney General under the Penal Code. Accordingly, the accused was sentenced to two years of rigorous imprisonment for each indictment and was imposed two fines of Rs. 50,000 each. He also ordered that the two sentences be served separately. Gnanasara Theros prison sentence was also ordered to be extended by two more years in the event of his failure to pay the fine. However, the judge, delivering the verdict, ruled that the allegations levelled against Gnanasara Thero by the prosecution have been proved beyond reasonable doubt, adding it became evident during the trial that the statement in question was not accidental but deliberate. Pointing out that such statements disrupts the religious harmony and unity in the country, the judge emphasized that the accused failed to fulfil his responsibility as a religious leader who is entrusted with maintaining the inter-faith harmony. Further, the judge informed Gnanasara Thero while delivering the verdict that he is allowed to appeal the verdict.",

        "date": "July 22, 2024 12:25 pm",
        "content": "While Sri Lanka has scrapped plans to sell a stake in its national carrier, SriLankan Airlines, after foreign offers it sought didnt meet up to expectations, government officials say they are pursuing an alternate route which still includes attracting investors to the debt-ridden airline. We are looking at an alternate proposal which would still be under the previous plan to invite investors. Its sensitive at the moment but we hope to announce the new plan in two to three weeks, said a source close to the negotiating team. On Thursday, the government said it had dropped plans to sell a minority stake of 49 per cent of SriLankan Airlines, after none of the bidding entities that expressed interest in it was deemed worthy. Instead, the airline will undergo restructuring under an alternate plan, stated Sri Lankan minister of ports, shipping and aviation Nimal Siripala de Silva. However, he did not share what the alternate proposal was. We are not going to sell SriLankan Airlines but restructure it. According to Sri Lankan law, only 49 per cent of the airlines shares can be given to a non-Sri Lankan entity  but there is minimal interest in the world for that. The airline reported an operating profit of 43.4 billion rupees (US143 million) from April 1, 2022 to March 31, 2023 but has suffered a net, carry forward loss of 71 billion rupees. The airline flies to 114 destinations in 62 countries, has a staff of 6,000 and has relied on government financial support to sustain the carrier. In October last year, the government called for offers to bail out the struggling airline and there were six bids, none of which included an international carrier. In 1998, Dubais Emirates bought a 43.6 per cent stake in SriLankan Airlines together with a 10-year management concession but opted out of renewing the contract in 2008 due to disagreement with local authorities. Aviation analysts said the lack of a clean balance sheet is one of the reasons why the airline is not attracting any positive offers. One analyst said: Investors want their money ploughed into the airline instead of settling a government loan. Another expert, who was involved in the 1998 part-sale to Emirates, said the problem in finding a suitable partner is the timing and uncertainty of the call for offers. He noted: Sri Lanka is heading for a series of elections starting with the Presidential election in SeptemberOctober 2024 and investors are unsure what the situation would be if a new president is elected. Furthermore, Sri Lankas economic woes have also created uncertainty. An acute economic crisis in 2022 which saw a shortage of foreign exchange led to long queues for fuel, cooking gas and essential items, forcing the authorities to seek an IMF bailout package. The government also needs to provide a proper risk assessment to potential investors so that they know in advance what they are getting into in making a positive bid. The amount of debt and the profitable routes and non-profitable routes have to be clearly expressed and whether these unprofitable routes would be shed; these are all questions that have to be answered, the aviation expert, who declined to be named, said.

        "title": "Bangladesh calm a day after top court scrapped some job quotas",
        "date": "July 22, 2024 01:42 pm",
        "content": "Bangladesh appeared calm on Monday amid a curfew, but widespread disruption of telecoms prevailed a day after the Supreme Court scrapped some quotas for government jobs that sparked protests this month that killed scores. Clashes between protesters and security forces killed at least 139 people across the South Asian nation after the high court last month reinstated job reservations removed by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasinas government in 2018. On Sunday, however, the Supreme Court ordered that 93 of government jobs should be allocated on the basis of merit, against earlier quotas of 56 for groups such as families of freedom fighters, women, and people from underdeveloped areas. There were no reports of violence or protests on Monday morning and media said curfew would be relaxed for three hours in the afternoon, extended from two hours the previous day, so that people could buy essentials. Student protesters have said they plan to continue demonstrations, however, until the release of detained protest leaders, and have demanded the government lift the curfew and re-open universities shut since Wednesday. They have set a 48-hour deadline for the government to act on the demands. Last weeks protests saw thousands injured as security forces fired tear gas, rubber bullets, and sound grenades to scatter the demonstrators. Experts have blamed the unrest on stagnant job growth in the private sector and high rates of youth unemployment that have made government jobs, with their regular wage hikes and other privileges, more attractive. Hasina, who was sworn in for a fourth consecutive term this year, has been accused of authoritarianism, human rights violations, and crackdowns on free speech and dissent in the past - charges her government denies.

        "date": "July 22, 2024 04:37 pm",
        "content": "A Brazilian conceptual artist swapped a historic British coin for a fake in the British Museum to highlight the large number of foreign objects it holds. Ile Sartuzi said the idea came to him when he saw a museum volunteer handing visitors coins to handle. He asked for an English Civil War-era silver coin because It is one of the few British things in the British Museum and then created a diversion while he swapped it for the fake. Sartuzi told Reuters he deposited the original coin in the museums collection box on the way out. The Art Newspaper first reported his act, which he recounted in a video made for his masters degree at Goldsmiths, University of London. The British Museum said it would inform police about the incident, which took place in June. This is a disappointing and derivative act that abuses a volunteer led service aimed at giving visitors the opportunity to handle real items and engage with history, a museum spokesperson said when asked for comment. Sartuzi said institutions such as the British museum and Frances Louvre view themselves as the holders of the treasures of humanity. The problem is that these institutions are the basis of imperialist cultures that looted a lot of these objects from the global south and world. The British Museum has been under scrutiny over the way it acquired some of the artefacts it holds, with some countries asking for pieces to be returned. Examples include the Parthenon Sculptures and Nigerias bronzes looted by British troops in 1897. It did not respond to Sartuzis allegations. Sartuzi, who has exhibited in Brazil, Portugal and London, said he had sought advice from an art lawyer before swapping the coin. The Museum dismissed an employee a year ago and ordered a review of security after it discovered hundreds of items had been stolen from its collection or were missing. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "content": "The Supreme Court today (22) granted leave to proceed with the Fundamental Rights petition filed seeking to invalidate the Gazette notification issued by Wildlife Minister Pavithra Wanniarachchi, which de-gazetted a section of the Wedithalathivu (Vidataltivu) Nature Reserve in Wilpattu to allocate it for a prawn farm project. A Supreme Court judge bench, consisting of Justices Preethi Padman Surasena and Shiran Gooneratne, has issued this order after considering the petition submitted by several environmental groups including the Center for Environmental Justice (CEJ). Accordingly, the FR petition has been fixed for hearing on November 12, 2024. On June 27, the Supreme Court issued an interim order preventing the implementation of the said Gazette notification issued by the Wildlife Minister. The Supreme Court had issued this order while allowing the hearing of a petition filed by several environmental organizations. The order stated that the interim order will remain in effect until the hearing of the petition is concluded. In May, an extraordinary gazette had been issued de-gazetting a section of the Vidataltivu Nature Reserve to set up an aquaculture industrial park. The aquaculture industrial park will reportedly be used for the farming of various species including marine finfish, crabs and exotic species of shrimp in a Public Private Partnership. The gazette issued by Minister of Wildlife and Forest Resources Conservation Pavithradevi Wanniarachchi, had noted that the area specified in the appendix of the gazette will no longer be designated as part of the Vidataltivu Nature Reserve. However, several environmental groups including the Center for Environmental Justice (CEJ) had filed a petition with the Supreme Court challenging the governments decision. The countrys third largest Marine Protected Area, Vidataltivu Nature Reserve, close to the Vankalai Sanctuary, was declared a Nature Reserve by Gazette 195613 on March 1, 2016 and covers 29,000 hectares. This followed the area being identified as needing protection by the Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) of the Northern Province conducted in 2012.",

The company will have the robots in high production for other companies use hopefully in 2026, Musk said in a post on social media platform X. Musk had said in April that the Tesla robot, called Optimus, would be able to perform tasks in the factory by the end of this year and could be ready for sale as soon as the end of 2025. Humanoid robots have been in development for several years by Japans Honda and Hyundai Motors Boston Dynamics. Several companies are betting on them to meet potential labor shortages and perform repetitive tasks that could be dangerous or tedious in industries such as logistics, warehousing and manufacturing. Musk has a history of failing to fulfill bold promises to Wall Street. In 2019, he told investors that Tesla would be operating a network of robotaxi autonomous cars by 2020. Tesla put out the first generation of its Optimus robot, dubbed Bumblebee, in September 2022. This year, the company posted a video of a second generation of the bipedal robot folding a T-shirt at the firms facility. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

However, the Kaduwela Magistrate had advised the suspect in question to rethink the decision and make the request again during an upcoming court date.

        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe stated that if foreign employment agencies focus on attracting tourists to Sri Lanka from the countries where they supply labour, including the Middle Eastern countries, the Ministry of Tourism will provide the necessary facilities. The President made this announcement during the Abhiman- 2024 event held yesterday (21) at the Epitome Hotel, Kurunegala. During the event, President Wickremesinghe also presented certificates and commemorative gifts to foreign employment agencies that significantly contribute to the countrys economy. Addressing the gathering, President Ranil Wickremesinghe further elaborated, I take this opportunity to thank you as we mark two years since I assumed the presidency. Your efforts in earning money for the country have been crucial in bringing us to our current state. Two years ago, we faced a difficult situation, and many doubted our ability to recover from the economic crisis. However, I believed that together with the people, we could restore our country. Unlike other countries, we have completed this work in less than two years. You are aware of the challenging journey we have undertaken. Many believed our country had no future. Factories lacked fuel, and no tourists visited our country. We began advancing our economy with the funds sent by our foreign employees. Now, we have confidence in our ability to face the future. Many countries around the world are asking us how we achieved this. We have repaid our debt to Bangladesh, a country currently facing a tense situation. We pray for peace and stability in Bangladesh, which supported us during our difficult times. We must now focus on the future. Our country should transform into an export economy. A formal program must be implemented to develop the skills of workers going abroad and provide them with the necessary training. This will enable them to secure better job opportunities and earn higher incomes, benefiting both the individuals and the country. We endured hardships for two years. With your support, I have brought the country forward during this time. You deserve the benefits of this progress. Together, we must build a new economy. Let us work collectively towards this goal. I believe you can bring business opportunities to Sri Lanka from the countries where our citizens are employed, especially from the Middle East. If we can send Sri Lankan employees to those countries, we should also attract tourists from those regions to Sri Lanka. By collaborating with the Ministry of Tourism, you can expand your business further. We will provide you with government support for these initiatives. Additionally, we would like to inform you that if we can export food to those countries, we will provide government support for that endeavour. We must think innovatively and embark on a new journey, avoiding stagnation. Remembering that it is not politicians who shape the future agenda of the country, I extend my best wishes for your future endeavours. Minister of Labour and Foreign Employment, Manusha Nanayakkara, At a time when some people pursued power at the expense of the public, President Ranil Wickremesinghe stepped forward unconditionally to alleviate their suffering. His effective diplomacy was evident during the severe economic crisis two years ago. Within this period, he managed to build an economy that allowed the oppressed to thrive. Supporting his economic vision, migrant employees channelled their earnings to Sri Lanka through banks, resulting in USD 12 billion in foreign exchange this year alone. In 2022, a country that lacked the foreign exchange to meet its basic needs is now functioning normally, thanks to the Presidents economic vision. You, as foreign employment agencies, played a crucial role in this achievement. The recognition of your contribution is presented through the Abhiman 2024 awards. Without your support, it is unimaginable where the country would be today. Therefore, we urge you to continue contributing to the nations development with your efforts.

The resolution was adopted at the third plenary session of the 20th CPC Central Committee on Thursday. The 20th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) adopted a resolution on further deepening reform comprehensively to advance Chinese modernization at its third plenary session held here from Monday to Thursday. The Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee presided over the meeting. General Secretary of the CPC Central Committee Xi Jinping delivered important addresses, according to a communique released Thursday. At the session, the Central Committee heard and discussed a report on the work of the Political Bureau, presented by Xi on behalf of the Political Bureau, and considered and adopted the Resolution of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on Further Deepening Reform Comprehensively to Advance Chinese Modernization. Xi delivered explanatory remarks on the draft version of the resolution. The overall objectives of further deepening reform comprehensively are to continue improving and developing the system of socialism with Chinese characteristics and modernize Chinas system and capacity for governance, according to the communique. By 2035, we will have finished building a high-standard socialist market economy in all respects, further improved the system of socialism with Chinese characteristics, generally modernized our system and capacity for governance, and basically realized socialist modernization, it said. All of this will lay a solid foundation for building China into a great modern socialist country in all respects by the middle of this century, it noted. The reform tasks laid out in the resolution shall be completed by the time the Peoples Republic of China celebrates its 80th founding anniversary in 2029, said the communique. The Central Committee made systematic plans for further deepening reform comprehensively, it added. In building a high-standard socialist market economy, the role of the market must be better leveraged, with a fairer and more dynamic market environment to be fostered and resource allocation to be made as efficient and productive as possible. Restrictions on the market will be lifted while effective regulation will be ensured to better maintain order in the market and remedy market failures, said the communique. In promoting high-quality development, the communique urged deepening supply-side structural reform, improving incentive and constraint mechanisms for promoting high-quality development, and creating new drivers and strengths for realizing growth. We will improve the institutions and mechanisms for fostering new quality productive forces in line with local conditions, for promoting full integration between the real economy and the digital economy, for developing the service sector, for modernizing infrastructure, and for enhancing the resilience and security of industrial and supply chains, it stated. In supporting all-around innovation, the Party will deepen comprehensive reform in education, structural scientific and technological reform, and institutional reforms for talent development. In improving macroeconomic governance, the communique urged pursuing coordinated reforms in the fiscal, tax, financial, and other major sectors and enhancing the consistency of macro policy orientation, with the national strategic planning system and policy coordination mechanisms to be improved. On integrated urban and rural development, the Party must promote equal exchanges and two-way flows of production factors between the cities and the countryside, so as to narrow the disparities between the two and promote their common prosperity and development, according to the communique. Reform of the land system will be deepened, it added. Describing opening up as a defining feature of Chinese modernization, the communique said that the Party will steadily expand institutional opening up, deepen the foreign trade structural reform, further reform the management systems for inward and outward investment, improve planning for regional opening up, and refine the mechanisms for high-quality cooperation under the Belt and Road Initiative. On developing whole-process peoples democracy, it said: We must firmly stay on the path of socialist political advancement with Chinese characteristics and uphold and improve our countrys foundational, basic, and important political systems.

        "content": "Leader of the Opposition Sajith Premadasa states that as severe economic challenges hit the nation, 25 of the child population is suffering from child poverty, highlighting the need for the initiation of a national programme to eradicate child poverty. In a situation where the country is grappling with a scarcity of rupees and dollars, 25 of the child population is suffering from poverty, we cannot stay idle, he said. Premadasa underscored the urgent need for a national programme to eradicate child poverty, emphasizing the multifaceted impact of economic hardship on children. Children are unable to attend school due to their economic difficulties. As a result, they do not receive a proper education, fail their examinations, and subsequently struggle to secure jobs. This failure to earn an income perpetuates the vicious cycle of child poverty, he explained. Furthermore, he mentioned: We will implement a special national programme aimed at eradicating child poverty before the end of this year. A Presidential Task Force tasked with eradicating child poverty must be established. Premadasa made these remarks while attending the 357th iteration of the Sakwala programme held at the Mahagamasekara Maha Vidyalaya, Gampaha today (22).",

        "date": "July 23, 2024 09:55 am",
        "content": "The signing of the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) for the provision of interest-free loans to agribusiness entrepreneurs and farmers under the first phase of the Agriculture Modernization Program took place on Monday (22) at the Presidential Secretariat. The MoUs were signed between the Bank of Ceylon, the Regional Development Bank who are the key contributors to the initial phase and Secretary to the Ministry of Agriculture and Plantation Industry Janaka Dharmakeerthi. Accordingly, MoU with the Peoples Bank are expected to be signed in the near future. In this first phase, Rs. 650 million have been allocated to implement projects through agricultural modernization centres in 26 Divisional Secretariat Divisions selected for pilot projects, with a total of 75 DS divisions identified. In the implementation of agricultural modernization projects within the DS divisions, more than 30 of the project costs are covered by agribusiness entrepreneurs and farmers, with the remaining 70 funded by the government. To facilitate a revolving credit scheme, the governments contribution, provided as an interest-free loan under the Agricultural Modernization Credit Scheme, can be recovered by a bank selected by the beneficiary from among the Bank of Ceylon (BoC), Peoples Bank, and Regional Development Bank (RDB). A cabinet memorandum presented by President Ranil Wickremesinghe to establish and implement this system has been approved. As a result, for selected and approved projects, interest-free loans will be paid to agribusiness entrepreneurs from funds deposited in an account in the name of the Secretary of the Ministry of Agriculture and Plantation at the Head Office of the Bank of Ceylon. Beneficiaries can choose between the Bank of Ceylon, Peoples Bank, and the Regional Development Bank for their loan processing. The loan concession period is up to 6 months, with a maximum repayment period of 5 years, including the concession period. The agriculture modernization centres determine the specific concession and repayment periods based on the loan amount and the nature of the project undertaken by the farmers or agribusiness entrepreneurs. Commenting on the scheme, Agriculture and Plantation Industry Ministry Secretary Janaka Dharmakeerthi emphasized the need to shift towards production-oriented programs. We need to transform to production-oriented programs even now. Through this agreement, we aim to identify and support categories with production potential, providing them with the necessary facilities and transforming them into initiatives that will boost production in the future. So far, we have tried to help people and increase production, but we have not yet reached our goal. Success is possible only if production is increased. We believe that the agricultural modernization program will lead to significant achievements. This program is crucial for reaching our long-term goals. Therefore, as a ministry, we are fully committed to supporting this initiative, the Secretary explained. Presidential Senior Adviser on Economic Affairs, Dr. R.H.S. Samaratunga, The agricultural modernization program has been highlighted in two budgets presented by President Ranil Wickremesinghe. The agreement signed today marks a crucial step for its advancement. One of the programs objectives is to allocate previously unused land to local entrepreneurs, fostering the development of export-oriented agriculture and establishing a commercial agriculture sector driven by local entrepreneurs. Presidential Adviser on the Agriculture Modernization Project, Senior Prof. Gamini Senanayake, Senior Additional Secretary to the President (Agricultural Productivity and Land), Chandra Herath, Director (Agricultural Productivity and Land) A.A.C. Nilantha Perera, BoC Deputy General Manager R.M.N. Jeevantha, RDB Chief Executive Officer General Manager (Acting) E.A.D.

        "date": "July 23, 2024 10:20 am",
        "content": "A gunman entered a nursing home in a quiet Croatian town on Monday and opened fire, killing six people including his mother, officials said. The dead were mostly in their 80s and 90s, the prime minister said. The national police chief, Nikola Milina, said five people died immediately and another died in a hospital. Five were residents and one was an employee. At least six other people were wounded, four seriously. The suspect fled but police caught him in a cafe near the facility in the town of Daruvar, Milina said. Authorities were investigating the motive behind the attack. N1 regional television reported that the suspect was born in 1973 and was a former policeman who took part in the 1991-95 war in Croatia and was decorated as a war veteran. Officials said he was known to police after causing several incidents in the past. Officials said the suspects mother had lived in the nursing home for 10 years. Daruvar resident Zlatko Sutuga told Nova TV he knew the suspect from the war era. People say that he was really aggressive, alcohol and all that, Sutuga said. The attack left the town stunned and grieving. Daruvar is a spa town in the municipality of Slavonia, with a population of 8,500. Relatives of residents gathered outside the modest one-story building to inquire about loved ones. We have my mom here, she is 90, Nina Samot told Nova TV. This is horrific what has happened, this is such a small town. Especially when you have someone inside. ... We are waiting, we are all in shock. The whole town is in shock. The mayor, Damir Lnenicek, told N1 TV the facility was an excellent one that housed about 20 people. What is the cause, the trigger, it is difficult to say, he said. That will be determined by the investigation. Croatian President Zoran Milanovic said he was shocked by the savage, unprecedented crime. He added it was a last call to all competent institutions to do more to prevent violence in society, including even more rigorous control of gun ownership. Police officials said the suspect used an unregistered gun. Many weapons are still kept in private homes in Croatia after the bloody breakup of Yugoslavia in the 1990s. Private gun ownership is legal with a mental health check. Source: AP --Agencies",

        "date": "July 23, 2024 11:32 am",
        "content": "The Sectoral Oversight Committee (SOC) on Environment, Natural Resources and Sustainable Development has drawn its attention to the process of collecting PET plastic bottles for the purpose for recycling, based on QR code. This was considered when the Sectoral Oversight Committee on Environment, Natural Resources and Sustainable Development met in Parliament recently under the Chairmanship of MP Ajith Mannapperuma, the Parliamentary Communications Department said. The Committee Chair stated that although 450,000 tons of plastic are imported into the country each year, only 50,000 tons are collected for recycling and a large amount of plastic is burnt in the open environment in the country. Furthermore, it was emphasized that attention should be mainly directed to PET plastic. Although approximately 1200 tons of PET plastic is used in this country per month, only 400 tons of it is recycled, and the remaining 900 tons are released into the environment in an improper manner. It was also highlighted that the said plastic is left in the rivers and canals and are burned in the open environment and is buried in the soil. It was disclosed that the main reason for not collecting PET plastic bottles is because the public is not interested in collecting them due to the lack of price for the bottles. Given the existing context pertaining to PET plastic bottles, newspaper advertisements had been published to receive technical and financial oriented proposals from industrialists in the field and parties who have an understanding of this issue, regarding a method of returning deposits for PET plastic bottles based on a QR code, before July 18. However, the industrialists in the field and parties present pointed out that the period given for that is insufficient. Accordingly, the parties present requested the Committee to extend the time given to submit proposals and make the Extended Producer Responsibility system mandatory. The Committee, which discussed the matter at length with all present, recommended to have the period for receiving proposals extend from July 18th to August 27th and to make the Extended Producer Responsibility system mandatory. Moreover, officials of the Ministry of Environment were instructed to do a study and report to the Committee regarding the methods followed in other countries of the world regarding the collection of PET plastic bottles for recycling based on the QR code. Members of Parliament Jayantha Samaraweera and Dr. Thilak Rajapakshe were also present at this Committee meeting held.",

        "content": "The Deputy Speaker of the Parliament Ajith Rajapaksa announced the House that in terms of the provisions of Article 79 of the Constitution of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka, Speaker Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena has endorsed the certificates on the Bills titled Sri Lanka Telecommunications (Amendment) and Shaili Educational Foundation (Incorporation). The announcement was made during the ongoing Parliamentary proceeding today (23). On July 09, the Sri Lanka Telecommunications (Amendment) Bill was passed in Parliament with amendments. Under the new telecommunications bill, Sri Lanka will introduce a new license category that will allow Starlink service to enter the countrys telecommunications space as a licensed service provider, as earlier stated by State Minister of Technology Kanaka Herath. The initiative of integrating the global Starlink network with Sri Lanka is said to be aimed at addressing the Wi-Fi connectivity issues, particularly in areas outside Colombo. Sri Lanka granted Starlink preliminary approval in June after fast-tracking the process. Starlink will have to pay a tariff for the license, which will be issued by the countrys telecommunications regulator, according to State Minister Kanaka Herath. President Ranil Wickremesinghe met with billionaire investor Elon Musk on the sidelines of the 10th World Water Forum High-Level Meeting being held in Indonesia on May 19, during which they have discussed the implementation of Starlink in Sri Lanka. Musk was in Indonesias resort island of Bali to launch Starlink satellite internet service in the worlds largest archipelago nation. The billionaire head of Tesla and SpaceX and owner of social platform X had launched the service alongside Indonesian President Joko Widodo in a ceremony at a public health clinic in Denpasar, the provincial capital of Bali. Unlike traditional telecommunications providers, which prioritise the most populated urban areas, Starlink aims to provide global coverage, extending internet connectivity to even the most remote corners of the planet. Starlink can provide internet access to virtually any location on Earth with a constellation of LEO satellites that can be re-positioned at any point, and according to experts, reliable internet access is possible, whether the user operates in the Congo, the Arctic, or on an oil rig located hundreds of miles offshore. So far, Starlink has more than 02 million active customers and is available on all seven continents and in over 60 countries.",

        "content": "The Cabinet of Ministers has approved the proposal that the government should apologize to the sections of society affected by the compulsory cremation policy enforced in Sri Lanka during the COVID-19 pandemic. Speaking during the Cabinet Press Conference held this afternoon (23), Cabinet Spokesman Minister Bandula Gunawardena stated that according to the guidelines published by the Ministry of Health on the clinical management of COVID-19, cremation was recommended as the method of disposal of the bodies of those who died of the virus. Accordingly, 276 Muslim victims of COVID-19 have been cremated, and later in February 2021, burials have been allowed for such persons with strict restrictions, he added. In July 2021, with the support of the University of Sri Jayawardenepura, then Ministry of Water Supply initiated a study to identify the SARS-CoV-2 virus in the aquatic environments of Colombo, Kandy, including river water, wastewater discharged from hospitals, quarantine centers and other potential areas. The study had revealed that there is no virus in the surface water. In March 2024, a second study was completed by the China-Sri Lanka Joint Research and Demonstration Center for Water Technology under the Ministry of Water Supply and Estate Infrastructure Development, which identified the primary sources of transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus to water sources, including groundwater. The source has been confirmed to be faeces and urine, not safe burials, the Minister added. Accordingly, the Cabinet of Ministers has granted approval to the proposal submitted by the Minister of Justice, Prisons and Constitutional Reforms, the Minister of Foreign Affairs and the Minister of Water Supply and Estates Infrastructure Development to apologize to the sections of society affected by the compulsory cremation policy enforced in Sri Lanka during the pandemic period. Meanwhile, since it has been confirmed that the primary source of transmission of the COVID-19 virus to water sources including groundwater is through faeces and urine and not through safe burials, attention has been focused on introducing a law that allows a person or a relative to choose the burial or cremation of the deceased as per their choice, in order to avoid such situations in the future. Also, if necessary, it has been found advisable to introduce relevant laws for donation of bodies to medical faculties. Accordingly, the Cabinet of Ministers has also approved the joint proposal presented by the Minister of Justice, Prisons and Constitutional Reforms and the Minister of Foreign Affairs to advise a draftsman to prepare a bill to introduce a new law allowing a person or a relative to choose the burial or cremation of the deceased as per their choice.",

In view of that situation, the need to provide relief to low-income individuals who have obtained mortgage advances from licensed banks has been identified, it added. Accordingly, it has been proposed to implement a suitable programme to provide an interest subsidy by the Treasury subject to a maximum of 10 per annum for mortgage advances not exceeding Rs.100,000- taken by customers on or before 30 June 2024 from licensed banks on an individual basis.

        "title": "Thousands of migrant kids reach Canary Islands alone; officials seek Spains help",
        "date": "July 23, 2024 05:10 pm",
        "content": "The children sometimes wont stop crying. Health workers dealing with migrants arriving on Spains Canary Islands try to understand if the tears are from illness, injury or, as is often the case, from pure shock. One young Senegalese boy who disembarked recently kept fainting every few minutes, troubling doctors who couldnt determine the cause. Other migrants finally explained: the boy had witnessed both parents die during the arduous boat voyage from West Africa. Their bodies were thrown overboard into the Atlantic Ocean. Theres no medicine for that, said Inmaculada Mora Peces, a 54-year-old emergency doctor who treats migrants arriving on the island of El Hierro. Mora Peces is among a growing number of people sounding the alarm as the archipelago struggles to deal with thousands of teenagers and children traveling alone to the European Union territory from Senegal, Mali, and other African nations, fleeing poverty, conflict and instability. On Tuesday, Spains parliament will vote to consider a legislative proposal that would force other regions to take responsibility for some of the minors currently stuck on the Canaries in dire conditions. The bill has sparked a national political crisis and there is no guarantee it will pass. The conservative Popular Party, the leading opposition to Spains left-wing national government, is torn. On the one hand, it is the junior member of the Canary Islands government and is being urged by its senior partner, the Canary Coalition party, to support the deal. On the other hand, the far-right Vox party, which rails against irregular migration and particularly unaccompanied minors, is threatening to withdraw from its coalition governments in other regions if the Popular Party accepts any deal to relocate underage migrants, even voluntarily. Under Spanish law, the regional authorities where the children arrive are responsible for their guardianship. But the Canary Islands government says it is overwhelmed, with more than 5,500 minors  far above its capacity for 2,000. Its a humanitarian catastrophe, said Francisco Candil, a regional government official in charge of social welfare. Not only do the Canary Islands lack physical space, but the regional government is struggling to hire professionals trained to work with the young migrants on the islands located some 1,300 kilometers (800 miles) from mainland Spain. As a result, the children and teenagers languishing on the islands are not receiving the protections they are entitled to under Spanish and European law, including education and healthcare. Spanish media have reported overcrowded centers as well as cases of abuse and mistreatment. On the island of Lanzarote, authorities have set up temporary tents to accommodate the new arrivals. Candil warned that the situation is only expected to deteriorate as boats keep sailing from the coasts of Senegal, Mauritania and the Western Sahara to the Spanish islands just 100 kilometres (60 miles) from Africas western coast. Nearly 20,000 men, women and children have reached the Canaries so far this year, a 160 increase from 2023. And thats even before the high season for migrant crossings begins in the fall, Candil added. Earlier this year, the EU signed a 210 million euro deal with Mauritania to stop smugglers from launching boats for Spain. But the deal has had little effect on migrant arrivals for now. If the bill doesnt pass for consideration in the Spanish parliament on Tuesday, it would be a failure for Spain and Europe, Candil said. With a population of 48 million people, it shouldnt be difficult for regions in mainland Spain to cope with a few hundred children, he argued. The Canary Islands would still care for the majority of unaccompanied minors. Spains Ombudsman Ángel Gabilondo called Friday for urgent structural and legal reforms after visiting two shelters for underage migrants in Tenerife. Its enough to go to a center to see the youth and feel their pain, Gabilondo said. They have been in the centers for months and see no future. We are talking about human beings, not goods. Meanwhile, professionals like Mora Peces say they feel helpless in the face of so many children and teenagers who arrive in terrible conditions after the dangerous ocean voyage. Today I arrived at my shift and my colleagues were crying. Well, I started working and in the end I ended up crying too, Mora Peces wrote on X last week, a tweet that has already gotten over 864,000 views. Last week doctors tried to save a 2-year-old girl who arrived on a boat from Senegal with her 8-year-old brother and mother. The girl got separated from her family and died despite attempts to save her. Mora Peces had to deliver the tragic news to her mother. The mother asked for a photo of her daughters body which Mora Peces asked the funeral home to send. While the vast majority of unaccompanied minors arriving are teenage boys, Candil and others say they are concerned by the increasing number of young children, particularly young girls, traveling alone  nearly 200 in the last eight months. Its highly unusual, Candil said. The girls flee forced marriages, abusive relationships, persecution or simply seek a better life, explained Siham Khalifa El Abdi, of the SAMU foundation which runs shelters specifically for unaccompanied girls. Among those under SAMUs care is a teenager who fled Mali due to her sexual orientation. During her five-month migration journey to Spain, she was assaulted and forced to have sex with older men in exchange for food. These girls are very damaged, said Khalifa El Abdi. Mora Peces, the doctor working in El Hierro, says shes horrified by the rhetoric used by some politicians in Madrid to discuss the issue, including the Popular Party and Vox who have called for the Spanish army and navy to be deployed to stop the migrant boats. She hears politicians and even regular people calling migrants rapists and criminals, a view that she describes as being completely at odds with the reality of the tiny people in dramatic situations that she treats. What they are discussing at the parliamentary level, it seems like they are not children, she said. As if they werent people. Source: The Associated Press --Agencies",

        "date": "July 23, 2024 08:13 pm",
        "content": "Under the Presidential Scholarship Program initiated as a concept of President Ranil Wickremesinghe, approximately 3,000 out of 5,000 scholarships will be awarded to lay students, student monks, and Sheela Matha in Piriven and Sheela Mata educational institutions. The ceremony is taking place tomorrow (24) at 3:00 pm at the Temple Tress under the patronage of President Wickremesinghe, the Presidents Media Division (PMD) said. This marks the first scholarship program of its kind for lay clergy students in Piriven. The initiative extends financial support to student monks studying up to the Piriven (Ordinary Level) and lay students up to the G.C.E. (Ordinary Level), providing them with Rs. 9,000 initially and Rs. 3,000 monthly for 12 months. Further support is available for student monks, Sheela Matha, and lay students who pass the Piriven or G.C.E. (Ordinary Level) exams and progress to the Pracheena or G.C.E. (AL) examinations. They will receive Rs. 6,000 monthly, with this support continuing for up to 24 months or until their exams. Each recipient will receive a lump sum of Rs. 18,000 at the award ceremony to cover outstanding instalments. In the coming days, instalment payments will be deposited directly into the bank accounts of other lay clergy scholarship recipients not present at the ceremony. The selection of scholarship winners involved the full cooperation of each Piriven Parivenadhipathi Thero or Institute Director, with oversight from the Piriven Education Sections under the Ministry of Education. The Presidents Fund has committed nearly Rs. 300 million annually to this program, which aims to reach all 10,126 schools on the island, benefiting 106,000 students. It offers Rs. 6,000 monthly to advanced-level students for 24 months and Rs. 3,000 to students from grade 1 to grade 11. The first phase of this 12-year program is now nearing completion. These initiatives highlight President Wickremesinghes commitment to ensuring that no one in need of support is left behind during these challenging times, the PMD reported.",

        "date": "July 23, 2024 10:05 pm",
        "content": "India-funded projects in the neighbourhood received the bulk of the allocation for the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) under the Union Budget presented by Indian Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Tuesday. Sri Lanka, which has a number of India-funded projects, has received 2450 million Indian rupees (INR), an improvement of INR 950 million over last years funding of INR 1500 million, according to The Hindu. India had bailed out Sri Lanka when its economy crashed and has provided grants and a line of credit worth 4 billion. Nepal secured an allocation of INR 7000 million, which is a jump of INR 1500 million from previous years allocation of INR 5500 million. Seychelles, which had an allocation of INR 100 million, has also received a boost in funding with the infusion of INR 300 million. Meanwhile, Bhutan, the largest recipient of the annual allocation under the MEA, has seen a dip in funding by INR 3320.2 million. Total funding for Bhutan this year stands at INR 20,685.6 million. Bhutan and India are close economic partners and Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri visited Thimphu last week, when the two sides cleared 61 projects amounting to INR 49,580 million. The slight reduction in the annual allocation therefore does not indicate a reduction in funding for projects in Bhutan. Dips in funding were seen for Myanmar, Mauritius, Bangladesh, and Mongolia. Conflict-torn Myanmar, which had an allocation of INR 4000 million last year, received INR 2500 million this year. Mauritius, with an allocation of INR 3700 million, has received INR 907.9 million less than the previous year. The allocation for Mongolia, which earlier received 70 million, has been scaled down to 50 million Indian rupees. Allocation for Bangladesh has dropped by INR 800 million to INR 1200 million. Both Afghanistan and the Maldives, with INR 2000 million and INR 4000 million, respectively, have secured the same allocation as last year. The Budget also allocated an additional INR 50 million for MEAs Aid for Cultural and Heritage Projects, bringing the total allocation to 150 million Indian rupees. Source: The Hindu --Agencies",

        "title": "US Secret Service director resigns over Trump assassination attempt",
        "date": "July 23, 2024 10:46 pm",
        "content": "(AP)  The director of the Secret Service said Tuesday shes resigning following the assassination attempt against ex-President Donald Trump that unleashed intensifying outcry about how the agency tasked with protecting current and former presidents could fail in its core mission. Kimberly Cheatle, who had served as Secret Service director since August 2022, had been facing growing calls to resign and several investigations into how the shooter was able to get so close to the Republican presidential nominee at an outdoor campaign rally in Pennsylvania. I take full responsibility for the security lapse, she said in an email to staff, obtained by The Associated Press. In light of recent events, it is with a heavy heart that I have made the difficult decision to step down as your director. Cheatles departure was unlikely to end the scrutiny of the long-troubled agency after the failures of July 13, and it comes at a critical juncture ahead of the Democratic National Convention and a busy presidential campaign season. Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have promised continued investigation, along with an inspector general probe and an independent and bipartisan effort launched at President Joe Bidens behest that will keep the agency in the spotlight. Cheatles resignation came a day after she appeared before a congressional committee and was berated for hours by both Democrats and Republicans for the security failures. She called the attempt on Trumps life the Secret Services most significant operational failure in decades and said she took full responsibility for the security lapses, but she angered lawmakers by failing to answer specific questions about the investigation. Biden said in a statement that we all know what happened that day can never happen again, and he said hed appoint a new director soon, but he did not discuss a timeline. The president said he was grateful to Cheatle for her decades of public service. We especially thank her for answering the call to lead the Secret Service during our administration and we are grateful for her service to our family, Biden said. Congressional questioning At the hearing Monday, Cheatle remained defiant that she was the right person to lead the Secret Service, even as she said she took responsibility for the security failures. When Republican Rep. Nancy Mace suggested Cheatle begin drafting her resignation letter from the hearing room, Cheatle responded, No, thank you. The 20-year-old shooter, Thomas Matthew Crooks, was able to get within 135 meters (157 yards) of the stage where the former president was speaking when he opened fire. Thats despite a threat on Trumps life from Iran leading to additional security for the former president in the days before the July 13 rally. Cheatle acknowledged Monday that the Secret Service was told about a suspicious person two to five times before the rally shooting. She also revealed that the roof from which Crooks opened fire had been identified as a potential vulnerability days earlier. But she failed to answer many questions about what happened, including why there were no agents on the roof. A bloodied Trump was quickly escorted off the stage by Secret Service agents, and agency snipers killed the shooter. Trump said part of his right ear was pierced in the shooting. One rallygoer was killed, and two others were critically wounded. Details continue to unfold about signs of trouble that day and what role the Secret Service and local authorities played in security. The agency routinely relies on local law enforcement to secure the perimeter of events where people its protecting appear. Former top Secret Service agents said the gunman should never have been allowed to gain access to the roof. After news of Cheatles resignation broke, Trump posted on his social media network saying: The BidenHarris Administration did not properly protect me, and I was forced to take a bullet for Democracy. IT WAS MY GREAT HONOR TO DO SO! The House Homeland Security Committee had asked Cheatle to testify Tuesday for another hearing on the assassination attempt but lawmakers said she refused. Cheatles name was on a card on a table in front of an empty chair during the hearing, which began shortly before her decision to step down became public. Investigating an ever growing number of threats Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Majorkas said he was proud to have worked with Cheatle and we are all grateful for her service. The Secret Service is a part of the Department of Homeland Security, which includes immigration, transportation security and the U.S. Coast Guard, formed after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attack. Just a few years ago, there was a movement to shift the agency back over to Treasury, where it was housed before Sept. 11, particularly because Homeland Securitys intense focus on immigration added to the growing divide between what the Secret Service sees as its dual missions  protecting the president and investigating financial crime  and the mission of its parent department. Roughly half of the Secret Services 3 billion budget is spent on protective services. It also has a robust cybercrime division, state-of-the-art forensic labs and a threat assessment center that studies how to mitigate and train against threats. With a workforce of 7,800 special agents, uniformed officers and other staff, the Secret Service has investigated an ever-increasing number of threats against the president and protectees and has managed a growing number of high-profile government figures asking for support. Staffing has not kept pace with the workload increase. Around Sept. 11 there were about 15 full-time protectees, now theres more than double. Trump is the first modern ex-president to seek another term, and because of his high visibility, his protective detail has always been larger than some of his peers. That protective bubble had only grown tighter in recent months as he became the presumptive Republican presidential nominee. All major party nominees are granted enhanced details with counterassault and counter-sniper teams similar to the president. Calls for accountability There were calls for accountability across the political spectrum, with congressional committees immediately moving to investigate, issuing a subpoena to testify and the top Republican leaders from both the House and the Senate saying she should step down. Biden, a Democrat, ordered an independent review into security at the rally, and the Secret Services inspector general opened an investigation. The agency is also reviewing its counter-sniper teams preparedness and operations. On Tuesday, House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Republican, said Cheatles resignation was overdue. Im happy to see that she has heeded the call of both Republicans and Democrats, he said. Now we have to pick up the pieces. We have to rebuild the American peoples faith and trust in the Secret Service as an agency. Cheatle served in the Secret Service for 27 years. She left in 2021 for a job as a security executive at PepsiCo before Biden asked her to return in 2022 to head the agency with a workforce of 7,800 special agents, uniformed officers and other staff. She took over amid a controversy over missing text messages from around the time thousands of Trump supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, following his 2020 election loss to Biden. During her time in the agency, Cheatle was the first woman to be named assistant director of protective operations, the division that provides protection to the president and other dignitaries, where she oversaw a 133.5 million budget. She is the second woman to lead the agency. When Biden announced Cheatles appointment, he said she had served on his detail when he was vice president and he and his wife came to trust her judgment and counsel. ___ Source: Associated Press --Agencies",

The Board arrived at this decision, at its meeting held on 23 July 2024, following a careful assessment of the current and expected macroeconomic developments and possible risks and uncertainties on the domestic and global fronts with a view to maintaining inflation at the targeted level of 5 per cent over the medium term, while enabling the economy to reach its full capacity. In arriving at this decision, the Board considered the need to signal the continuation of the eased monetary policy stance, thereby inducing a further reduction in market lending rates to support economic activity, amidst a benign inflation outlook, the central bank said. The Board noted that, based on the available information, inflation is likely to remain below the inflation target of 5 per cent by a sizeable margin for the next several months before aligning with the targeted level over the medium term, the statement said.",

The Supreme Court issued this order after granting leave to proceed with the nine petitions, filed by several parties including Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith, challenging the decision to appoint Tennakoon as the IGP. The Supreme Court also ordered the President to name a suitable person for the post of IGP, for the duration of the interim order being enforced against Deshabandu Tennakoon, Ada Derana reporter said. The fundamental rights (FR) petitions filed challenging the appointment of Deshabandu Tennakoon as IGP were taken up once again today (24). The petitioners had sought an interim order restraining Deshabandu Tennakoon from discharging the duties and functioning in the office of IGP. The Supreme Court on July 18 concluded considering the FR petitions filed challenging the appointment of Tennakoon as the IGP. Accordingly, the court had then announced that the decision as to whether or not the petitions will be taken up for hearing will be delivered today (24). The court was also expected to announce as to whether an interim order will be issued preventing Deshabandu Tennakoon from functioning as the IGP. A three-member bench had on several previous occasions considered the nine petitions put forward by several parties including the Archbishop of Colombo Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith, Prof. Savitri Gunasekara, former MP Hirunika Premachandra and several others. The Speaker of Parliament, the members of the Constitutional Council, IGP Tennakoon, the Attorney General and several others have been named as the respondents of the petitions. The petitioners allege that Tennakoon had neglected his duties during his tenure as the Senior Deputy Inspector General of Police (SDIG) of the Western Province when the 2019 Easter attacks happened, and when a pre-mediated attack was launched on the GotaGoGama protest site at the Galle Face Green where several protesters were brutally assaulted. They emphasized that the post of the police chief, who is responsible for the implementation of the law in the country, should be given to an individual who has humane qualities, as opposed to someone who acted contrary to his assigned duties and in violation of basic human rights. Further, the petitioners claimed that the appointment of the police chief had not been properly approved by the Constitutional Council. On that account, the petitioners have sought a Supreme Court ruling invalidating the appointment of the police chief. Speaker Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena had previously been accused unconstitutionally and unlawfully using his decisive vote to affirm the appointment of IGP Tennakoon when the other members of the Constitutional Council were divided and were tied with their votes on the matter. It was reported that four Constitutional Council members had voted in favour of the appointment while 2 voted against and 2 others abstained. However, considering the 2 abstentions as votes cast against, the Speaker had used his vote as the deciding vote to go ahead with the appointment. Against this backdrop, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volter Turk had also raised concerns about the recent appointment of IGP Tennakoon, despite the Supreme Courts finding that he was implicated in the torture of an individual in 2010.",

He expressed concerns stating that if an egg cannot be sold for at least Rs. 40, they would have to import eggs from India. He pointed out that during the festival season in December, cake manufacturers will also be purchasing a large quantity of eggs.

        "date": "July 24, 2024 12:07 pm",
        "content": "Bangladesh partially restored telecommunication services on Wednesday although Internet connection was slow and social media remained suspended, days after deadly protests against reservations for government jobs killed almost 150 people. The country has mostly been calm since Sunday when the Supreme Court scaled down reservations for various categories to 7 percent, overruling a high court verdict reinstating a 56 percent quota in government jobs that had been scrapped in 2018. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasinas government said on Tuesday that it would heed the Supreme Court ruling. As demonstrations against the quotas which included a 30 percent reservation for family members of freedom fighters from the 1971 war of independence from Pakistan tapered off, the government started easing the curfew imposed last week. Restrictions will be relaxed for seven hours on Wednesday and offices will also be open from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m., officials said. Residents of the capital Dhaka could be seen out on the streets on Wednesday morning as they made their way to their offices, with public buses also plying in some places in sharp contrast to the violent clashes in the city last week. Protesting students have given the government a fresh 48-hour ultimatum to fulfill four other conditions of an eight-point list of demands, and said they will announce next steps once that ends on Thursday. We want the government to meet our four-point demand, including restoration of Internet, withdrawal of police from campuses, and opening universities (which have been closed for a week), protest coordinator Nahid Islam said. The South Asian nation of 170 million was rocked by protests since the high court verdict last month, which left less than half of state jobs open on merit in a country where about 32 million young people are out of work or education. Demonstrations intensified after Hasina refused to meet the protesters demands and instead labelled them razakar a term used for those who collaborated with the Pakistani army during the war. Hasina this week blamed her political opponents for the violence and said the curfew would be lifted whenever the situation gets better. The main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party has denied any role in the violence. Several countries in the region have evacuated citizens from the violence-hit nation over the last few days, including India and Malaysia. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "title": "Harris bashes Trump over fear and hate in debut rally",
        "date": "July 24, 2024 03:27 pm",
        "content": "(Reuters) - U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris assailed Donald Trump on Tuesday at her first campaign rally since replacing President Joe Biden as the Democratic presidential candidate, while a ReutersIpsos opinion poll showed her taking a marginal lead over her Republican rival. In a 17-minute speech, Harris aggressively went after Trumps vulnerabilities, comparing her background as a former prosecutor to his record as a convicted felon. Harris ticked through a list of liberal priorities, saying that if elected she would act to expand abortion access, make it easier for workers to join unions and address gun violence, drawing a sharp contrast with Trump, the Republican nominee for president in the Nov. 5 election. Donald Trump wants to take our country backward, she told a cheering crowd of several thousand at West Allis Central High School in a Milwaukee suburb in Wisconsin, a battleground state with a pivotal role in deciding the election outcome. Do we want to live in a country of freedom, compassion and rule of law, or a country of chaos, fear and hate? The raucous rally was a notable contrast to the smaller, more subdued events Biden held, underscoring Democrats hope that Harris, 59, can revive what had been a flagging campaign under Biden, 81. The audience danced and waved Harris signs, while chants of Ka-ma-la! broke out when she took the stage. She emphasized her commitment to reproductive rights, an issue that has plagued Republicans since the U.S. Supreme Court - powered by three Trump-appointed justices - eliminated a nationwide right to abortion in 2022. Harris led Trump 44 to 42 among registered voters in the national ReutersIpsos poll, conducted on Monday and Tuesday after Biden dropped out of the contest on Sunday and endorsed Harris as his successor. A ReutersIpsos poll last week showed Biden, before he ended his campaign, trailing Trump by two percentage points. Both were within the polls three-point margin of error. But the results could signal limited movement in Democrats direction - and may suggest that Harris elevation to the top of the ticket blunted whatever momentum Trump hoped to gain from last weeks Republican National Convention, also in Milwaukee. Trump and his allies have tried to tether Harris to some of Bidens more unpopular policies, including his administrations handling of the surge of migrants at the southern border with Mexico. In a conference call with reporters on Tuesday, Trump expressed confidence in his ability to defeat Harris, noting that her previous presidential run in 2020 did not even survive until the first statewide nominating contest. Trump offered to debate Harris multiple times. Trump and Biden had one more debate scheduled on Sept. 10 after their encounter on June 27. Bidens poor performance that night led to Democratic calls for him to step aside. I want to debate her, and shell be no different because they have the same policies, Trump said. A SWIFT RISE Harris swiftly consolidated her partys support after Biden, 81, abandoned his reelection campaign under pressure from members of his party who worried about his ability to beat Trump, 78, or to serve for another four-year term. She wrapped up the nomination on Monday night by winning pledges from a majority of the delegates who at next months party convention will determine the nominee, the campaign said. Her campaign said it had raised 100 million since Sunday. Most Democratic lawmakers have lined up behind her candidacy, including the partys leaders in the Senate and House, Chuck Schumer and Hakeem Jeffries, who endorsed Harris on Tuesday at a joint press conference. Harris rise dramatically reshapes an election in which many voters were unhappy with their options. As the first Black woman and Asian American to serve as vice president, she would make further history as the first woman elected U.S. president. Wisconsin is among a trio of Rust Belt states, along with Michigan and Pennsylvania, that are critical to Democrats chances of defeating Trump. Alyssa Wahlberg, 19, chair of the Whitewater College Democrats, said Harris had reenergized young voters, particularly women who want Harris to break the ultimate U.S. glass ceiling. I talked to my grandmom. We are both excited that she may live to see the first woman president, said Wahlberg, who was attending Tuesdays rally. Its taken too long. Saddled with concerns that included his health and persistent high prices crimping Americans household finances, Biden had been losing ground against Trump in opinion polls, particularly in the competitive states that are likely to decide the election, including the Sun Belt states of Arizona and Nevada. BIDEN TO ADDRESS NATION Biden said on X that he would deliver a Wednesday night Oval Office speech explaining his decision to end his campaign. He returned to Washington on Tuesday after spending several days isolating at home with COVID-19. The president has tested negative and no longer has symptoms, the White House doctor said in a letter on Tuesday. Bidens dramatic exit followed Trumps narrow survival of a July 13 assassination attempt that raised questions about security failures in the U.S. Secret Service. The agency director, Kimberly Cheatle, resigned on Tuesday. The Washington Post reported that Secret Service officials have encouraged the Trump campaign to stop holding outdoor rallies like the one in Butler, Pennsylvania, where Trump was wounded in the right ear. The Post cited unnamed people familiar with the matter. The Secret Service and the Trump campaign did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Democratic National Committee chair Jaime Harrison, in an interview on NBCs Today program, said the party had to move quickly to get the ticket on ballots in all 50 states, and that Harris vice presidential pick needed to be made by Aug. 7. Potential running mates include Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear, U.S. Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg, North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper, Arizona Senator Mark Kelly, Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker, Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro and Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "content": "The Japanese government today officially announced the release of funds for the resumption of development projects undertaken in Sri Lanka. A special press conference to officially announce the release of funds for restarting the projects was held today (24) at the Auditorium of the Ministry of Finance. The official announcement of Dr. TANAKA Akihiko, President of Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) on the resumption of the disbursement was handed over to Mr. K.M. Mahinda Siriwardana, Secretary to the Treasury and the Ministry of Finance, Economic Stabilization and National Policies, by Ms. IDE Yuri, Senior Representative of the JICA Sri Lanka Office. Treasury Secretary Mahinda Siriwardana expressed his sincere gratitude on behalf of the Government of Sri Lanka to the Government of Japan for their pivotal role throughout the debt treatment process and being the foremost decision taker to refinance the ongoing infrastructure development projects, the Ministry of Finance, Economic Stabilization and National Policies said. The statement further said: Marking a significant milestone in the official debt treatment process, the Government of Sri Lanka reached the final agreement on its debt treatment with members of the Official Creditor Committee (OCC) of Sri Lankas bilateral creditors on June 26, 2024. As a longstanding development partner of Sri Lanka, the Government of Japan supported the initiation of the coordination platform with Sri Lankas bilateral creditors, and played a vital role throughout the process of reaching the agreement with the OCC. The conclusion of the agreement with the OCC, and significant progress in restructuring debt with other creditors, along with the commitment of the Government of Sri Lanka to implement comprehensive macroeconomic reforms supported by the International Monetary Fund and other multilateral partners, has enhanced confidence in the economic stability and debt sustainability of Sri Lanka. The Government of Japan announced its crucial decision of resuming disbursement for the Japan-funded project portfolio of the country, signaling confidence in Sri Lankas economic reform programme and renewed optimism regarding the future prospects of the country. With this landmark decision, the suspended projects, including the Bandaranaike International Airport Development Project, utility projects, health sector improvement projects, rural development projects, etc., will be resurrected, paving the way for the economic and social improvement of the country. The Bandaranaike International Airport Development Project, in particular, is critical for developing Sri Lankas connectivity-related infrastructure which would be a major boost for key sectors such as tourism, trade, and investment.",

The Gulf Arab states foreign minister, Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan, thanked the billionaire entrepreneur for supporting the UAE field hospital in Gaza, where many medical facilities have been destroyed in over nine months of war. Starlink is now active in a Gaza hospital with the support of UAEmediaoffice and Israel, Musk posted on X, more than five months after the Israeli government approved Starlinks use in the hospital in the southern Gaza city of Rafah. The high-speed internet will enable potentially life-saving medical consultations via real-time video calling, the UAE foreign ministry said in February. Internet connectivity in Gaza is poor because of the lack of power and fuel to operate provider centres. This makes it harder for medical staff and rescue teams to work, and restricts hospital services and the health ministrys centralised system. The UAE, an oil producer and regional finance and tourism hub, signed a deal normalising ties with Israel in 2020 along with Bahrain and Morocco. Sudan later also sealed a normalisation agreement with Israel. The Gaza war began when Hamas-led fighters attacked Israel, killing 1,200 people and taking over 250 hostages back to the Palestinian enclave, according to Israeli tallies. Israel responded with an offensive that has killed more than 39,000 Palestinians, according to Gazas Hamas-run health ministry, and devastated much of the coastal territory.

She said that she and MrBeast - real name Jimmy Donaldson - have mutually decided its best I permanently step away from all things MrBeast and social media to focus on my family and mental health. Ava rose to fame after appearing alongside MrBeast on his channel, which has more than 300m subscribers, since 2012. In 2022 he became the most subscribed YouTuber on the platform and is known for huge stunts and his philanthropic videos. Ava revealed last year that she was a transgender woman and that she was undergoing gender-affirming therapy while changing her pronouns to sheher. Allegations first surfaced against her last month in videos which accuse her of messaging a minor when she was 20. Ava responded by saying: To create a narrative that my behaviour extended beyond bad edgy jokes is disgusting and did not happen. In past years, I have learned that my old humour is not acceptable. I cannot change who I was, but I can continue to work on myself. I humbly apologise to anyone I have hurt with my unacceptable social media posts, past actions, and to those who may feel betrayed by how I used to act online.
