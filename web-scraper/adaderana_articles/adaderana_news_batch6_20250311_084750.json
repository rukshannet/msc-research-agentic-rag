Later, the SLFPs politburo appointed Minister of Ports, Aviation and Shipping Nimal Siripala de Silva as the partys Acting Chairman on April 08. Earlier in March, former President Maithripala Sirisena had stirred controversy when he claimed he was aware of the true mastermind of the 2019 Easter Sunday terror attacks and that he was prepared to disclose the information to the judiciary if inquired from him or if an order is issued regarding the matter. Speaking to the media in Kandy, Sirisena said that he is ready to disclose the relevant information and that at the same time, it is the responsibility of the judges to keep the information strictly confidential. Against this backdrop, Justice Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe said on Tuesday (16) that he has received several requests urging him to run for president in the upcoming election. Speaking to the media, the lawmaker revealed that the majority of these requests came from the members of the Central Committee of SLFP. Additionally, religious leaders including the Maha Sangha have sought the same, he said further. Rajapakshe said that he would take into account these requests and arrive at a final decision in the coming weeks.",

        "title": "Almost half of all major Chinese cities are sinking, study says",
        "date": "April 21, 2024 06:24 pm",
        "content": "Almost half of Chinas major cities are sinking, putting millions of locals at risk of flooding, according to a new study published in the journal Science this week. The study found that 45 of Chinas urban land was sinking faster than 3 mm a year, while 16 was sinking at a rate of more than 10 mm a year. The study authors looked at 82 Chinese cities with populations of more than 2 million and used radar pulses from satellites to identify any changes in the distance between the satellite and the ground. They then measured how the cities elevations had changed between 2015 and 2022. They found that Chinas largest city, Shanghai, was continuing to subside despite already sinking around 3 m over the past 100 years. Cities such as Beijing and Tianjin were also particularly affected. Causes There are a number of factors leading to the subsidence, but Robert Nicholls, a professor of climate adaptation at the University of East Anglia, who was not involved in the research, told the BBC that he believed that water extraction was probably the dominant reason. In China there are lots of people living in areas that have been fairly recently sedimented, geologically speaking. So when you take out groundwater or you drain the soils, they tend to subside, he said. The paper also suggested that the resolution to the issue could lie in the long-term, sustained control of groundwater extraction. In a comment article also published in Science, Nicholls warned that subsidence jeopardises the structural integrity of buildings and critical infrastructure and exacerbates the impacts of climate change in terms of flooding, particularly in coastal cities where it reinforces sea-level rise. Subsidence already costs China over 7.5 billion yuan, which is around 1.05 billion, a year, Reuters reported. The problem is not confined to China, however. Another paper published in February said that around 6.3 million square km, or around 2.4 million square miles, of land around the world was at risk of subsidence, with Indonesia one of the worst affected countries. Parts of the US have also suffered from the problem, with more than 17,000 square miles of land across 45 states directly affected, according to the United States Geological Survey (USGS). According to the USGS, more than 80 of the identified cases of subsidence in the US occurred due to the exploitation of underground water. The increasing development of land and water resources threatens to exacerbate existing land-subsidence problems and initiate new ones, it adds. Source: The Business Insider --Agencies",

        "title": "Sri Lanka to miss budget revenue target for 33rd year running in 2024: Verité Research",
        "date": "April 21, 2024 07:26 pm",
        "content": "Sri Lankas fiscal landscape remains challenging as it continues to struggle with meeting its revenue to GDP target for the 33rd consecutive year. The recently released State of the Budget Report 2024 by Verité Research underscores this persistent issue, offering a comprehensive analysis of Sri Lankas fiscal health. This annual report serves as a crucial tool for informed engagement with the budget, providing objective insights into the countrys fiscal, financial, and economic estimates. Verité Researchs analysis reveals a stark reality: Sri Lankas tax revenue has consistently fallen short of expectations. The governments projections for 2023 saw a significant 13 deficit in tax revenue. Despite the governments optimism with a projected revenue of LKR 4,164 billion for 2024  marking a 42 increase from the previous years revised projections  Verité Research paints a more conservative picture. Their projection anticipates a 14 shortfall, estimating revenue at only LKR 3,570 billion. The report points out that the overestimation of revenue from Value Added Tax (VAT) accounts for 61 of the projected shortfall, with the remainder attributed to overestimations in corporate income tax, personal income tax, Social Security Contribution Levy (SSCL), and Customs import duty. This persistent pattern of overestimation underscores the need for more accurate fiscal planning and forecasting methodologies. Beyond revenue projections, Sri Lanka faces another pressing issue, its soaring interest-cost-to-revenue ratio, the highest globally. The governments 2024 budget aims to reduce this ratio to 64. However, Verité Researchs analysis, coupled with government calculations of interest costs, paints a bleaker picture. Projections suggest that this ratio will likely exceed 70, a hindrance to economic recovery and debt sustainability. Such a scenario not only falls short of expectations but also jeopardizes Sri Lankas adherence to its economic recovery plan agreed upon with the International Monetary Fund (IMF). In conclusion, the State of the Budget Report 2024 serves as a critical resource for policymakers, economists, and stakeholders alike, offering a sobering assessment of Sri Lankas fiscal challenges. Addressing these issues requires concerted efforts to improve revenue collection mechanisms, accurately forecast fiscal targets, and pursue prudent fiscal policies to ensure sustainable economic growth and stability. --Public Finance--",

        "date": "April 21, 2024 08:31 pm",
        "content": "The United Nations on Sunday urged Sri Lanka to bridge its accountability deficit and ensure justice as the country commemorated the 279 victims of its worst-ever attack against civilians five years ago. The UNs top envoy to the country, Marc-Andre Franche, told a remembrance service in Colombo that there should be a thorough and transparent investigation to uncover those behind the Easter carnage in 2019. Islamist bombers hit three churches and three hotels in the islands deadliest suicide attack aimed at civilians, but grieving families say they are still waiting for justice. Among the dead were 45 foreigners, including tourists visiting the island a decade after the end of a brutal ethnic conflict that had claimed more than 100,000 lives since 1972. Sri Lanka suffers from a continuing accountability deficit, be it for alleged war crimes, more recent human rights violations, corruption or abuse of power, which must be addressed if the country is to move forward, Franche said. He noted that victims were still seeking justice despite the countrys Supreme Court holding the then president Maithripala Sirisena and his top officials responsible for failing to prevent the attack. Delivering justice for victims of these attacks should be part of addressing the systemic challenge, Franche said. He said the UN Human Rights office has also called on Colombo to publish the complete findings of previous inquiries into the Easter Sunday bombings and to establish an independent investigation. - Other forces - The leader of Sri Lankas Catholic church, Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith, accused President Ranil Wickremesinghes government of suppressing new evidence and protecting those behind the jihadists. It is clear that Islamist extremists carried out the attack, but there were other forces behind them, Ranjith said. We have to conclude that the current government too is trying to protect them. He has previously alleged that military intelligence officers engineered the April 21, 2019 attack to help the political ambitions of Gotabaya Rajapaksa, a retired army officer who campaigned on security. Seven months later he won the presidency. Since coming to power, Rajapaksa had systematically protected those behind the bombings, the Cardinal said. Rajapaksa was forced out of office in July 2022 following months of protests over an unprecedented economic crisis that caused shortages of food, fuel and medicines. Thousands of Sri Lankas Catholic minority staged a silent protest outside the capital after multi-faith services to bless the victims, who included more than 80 children. Relatives carried photos of the dead and protested in the town of Negombo -- known as Sri Lankas Little Rome because of its heavy concentration of Catholics. Military personnel armed with automatic assault rifles watched as the protesters marched to the nearby St Sebastians church, where 114 people were killed in the coordinated suicide bombings. Evidence tendered during a civil case brought by relatives of the victims showed that Indian intelligence officials warned Colombo of the bombings some 17 days earlier, but the authorities failed to act. Then-president Sirisena and his officials have been ordered to pay 310 million rupees (1 million) in compensation to victims and relatives. But the ruling has yet to be fully implemented as Sirisena has appealed and a fresh hearing is scheduled for July. Source: AFP --Agencies",

        "content": "The United States Navy, U.S. Marine Corps, and Sri Lanka Navy will partner for the Cooperation Afloat Readiness and Training (CARAT) Sri Lanka 2024 exercise from April 22-26 in Trincomalee. CARAT Sri Lanka will feature the expertise of the U.S. Fleet Anti-Terrorism Security Team (FAST), a U.S. Marine Corps unit specialized in security and anti-terrorism for naval assets, engaging alongside their Sri Lanka Navy Marine counterparts on a full spectrum of naval capabilities, the US Embassy in Colombo said. The CARAT Sri Lanka exercise includes a Women, Peace, and Security Symposium on April 24 to promote the vital roles women play in peace negotiations, conflict management, and resolution. With approximately 70 U.S. personnel working with their Sri Lanka military partners, this fifth iteration of the CARAT Sri Lanka bilateral maritime exercise underscores the strong partnership and shared commitment of the United States and Sri Lanka to maintain a free and open Indo-Pacific. U.S. Ambassador to Sri Lanka Julie Chung emphasized the significance of the exercise: Since Sri Lanka began participating in CARAT in 2017, it has grown to become the most significant bilateral military engagement between the United States and Sri Lanka, reflecting our shared commitment to the peace and stability of the Indian Ocean Region. This exercise demonstrates the importance the United States places on nurturing partnerships, encouraging cooperation, and advancing maritime capabilities, enabling the U.S. and Sri Lankan navies to better operate together to address maritime security challenges in the Indo-Pacific. The Commander of the Sri Lanka Navy, Vice Admiral Priyantha Perera stated that: Taking part in exercises of this nature enables the Sri Lanka Navy to gain confidence, experience and operational training by working alongside an experienced and well-equipped navy like the U.S. Navy. This can be particularly valuable in situations where the Sri Lanka Navy is required to engage with multiple array of navies for combined operations in the establishment of freedom of navigation and rules-based order in the ocean region, as well as responding to traditional and nontraditional threats in the maritime domain. Senior Defense Official at the U.S. Embassy Anthony Nelson praised the collaborative people-to-people spirit that the upcoming CARAT exercise exemplifies: The aim of CARAT is to enhance the ability of our navies to defend our own nations and uphold the international standards that serve our mutual interests. But its not just about honing our naval capabilities; CARAT Sri Lanka 2024 stands as a powerful symbol of our partnership, building lasting friendships and mutual understanding by working shoulder to shoulder with our Sri Lankan counterparts. Initiated in 1995, CARAT is a series of bilateral and multilateral exercises between the United States and Bangladesh, Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Sri Lanka, Thailand, and Timor-Leste. Celebrating its 30th anniversary, this exercise series is designed to enhance the operational collaboration between the U.S. and partner navies abilities to operate together in response to traditional and non-traditional maritime security challenges in the Indo-Pacific region and build relationships through sports, cultural, and information exchanges.",

President of the association, Upul Rohana stated that the relevant rice stocks have become unfit for consumption due to insect damage. It was reported that the rice stocks in question were set to be used in the school meals program implemented in collaboration with the World Food Programme (WFP), to provide free nutritious lunches for schoolchildren. In view of the current situation, arrangements have been made to temporarily suspend the release of rice stocks from the relevant food warehouse. There have been numerous complaints regarding the quality of these rice stocks. Consequently, the Public Health Inspectors from the Veyangoda MOH Office of Medical Officer of Health have collected over 1,000 samples of rice from this store, as instructed by the Government Analyst, Mr. Rohana said. The reports of these samples were received by the Veyangoda MOH yesterday. According to the Government Analysts report, more than 50 of the samples sent were found to be damaged by insects. This has raised concerns regarding the suitability of this rice for human consumption. As a result, the distribution of rice to schools from this warehouse has been temporarily suspended, he added.",

Muizzus Peoples National Congress (PNC) won 65 of the 93 seats up for grabs on Sunday, preliminary results from the Maldives Elections Commission and media projections show. The main opposition Maldives Democratic Party (MDP) dwindled to just 12 seats from 65 earlier. Both Beijing and New Delhi have wooed the Maldives as they vie for influence in the Indo-Pacific region. Elected last year, Muizzu has pledged to end the countrys India First policy, straining ties with New Delhi. His government has asked dozens of Indian military personnel to leave the Maldives, a move critics say could hasten its shift towards China.

        "date": "April 22, 2024 07:10 pm",
        "content": "The Israeli militarys intelligence chief has resigned, saying he took responsibility for the failures before Hamass attack on Israel on 7 October. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said Major General Aharon Haliva would retire once his successor was selected. He acknowledged in a letter that his intelligence directorate did not live up to the task we were entrusted with. He is the first senior figure to step down over the attack, which were the deadliest in Israels history. Israeli military and intelligence officials missed or ignored multiple warnings before hundreds of Hamas gunmen breached the Gaza border fence that day and attacked nearby Israeli communities, military bases and a music festival. About 1,200 Israelis and foreigners - mostly civilians - were killed and 253 others were taken back to Gaza as hostages, according to Israeli tallies. Israel responded by launching its most intense ever war in Gaza with the aims of destroying Hamas and freeing the hostages. More than 34,000 Palestinians in Gaza - most of them children and women - have been killed in the conflict, the territorys Hamas-run health ministry says. A statement put out by the IDF on Monday said Maj Gen Haliva had requested to end his position, following his leadership responsibility as the head of the intelligence directorate for the events of 7 October. In his resignation letter, the general wrote: I carry that black day with me ever since, day after day, night after night. I will carry the horrible pain of the war with me forever. He also called for the establishment of a state commission of inquiry that can investigate and find out in a thorough, in-depth, comprehensive and precise manner all the factors and circumstances that led to the difficult events. Everything I did during my service in the IDF was for the sake of the people of Israel and the State of Israel, he added. Maj Gen Halivas resignation had been anticipated, given that he had stated 10 days after the attack that he bore full responsibility for the intelligence failures of his directorate. However, the announcement sets the stage for what is expected to be more fallout from Israels top security officials. The IDFs chief of staff, Lt Gen Herzi Halevi, and the director of the Shin Bet security service, Ronen Bar, have both taken responsibility for failing to protect Israelis but decided to stay on for the war in Gaza. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said that everyone will need to provide answers, myself included. However, he so far refused to accept any direct responsibility. Opposition leader Yair Lapid said on X (formerly Twitter) that Maj Gen Halivas decision to resign was justified and honourable, but added that Mr Netanyahu should have done the same.

However, the Presidential Secretariats Partnership Secretariat for WFP Co-operation has issued a special press release clarifying the relevant facts and responding to the allegations. It said that in order to ensure compliance, all Provincial Chief Secretaries are instructed in writing to mobilize a team that represents the health sector to conduct a thorough re-inspection and retrieval of the rice stock confirmed safe for consumption by multiple institutions from the Veyangoda warehouse complex. Additionally, they are tasked with strategizing to utilize this rice stock before May 01.

Compliant with international food packaging quality standards, this batch of rice is advised to be utilized before May 31. As the rice has been received as a grant, the packaging is labelled Not for Sale. This label does not indicate that the rice is unsuitable for consumption, it added. Following a comprehensive inspection representing diverse health sector considerations, the World Food Program has confirmed its suitability, the Presidential Secretariat further said.",

        "content": "Two Malaysian navy helicopters collided in mid-air as they flew in formation during a rehearsal for a military parade, killing all 10 crew on board. One of the aircraft clipped the rotor of the other before the two crashed into the ground, footage published on local media showed. The incident took place at 09:30 local time (02:30 BST) in the Malaysian town of Lumut, which is home to a Royal Malaysian Navy base. There are no known survivors. All victims were confirmed dead on site and the remains were sent to the Lumut Military Hospital for identification, said the Royal Malaysian Navy. It added that it would form a committee to investigate the cause of the incident. One of the helicopters, a HOM M503-3 with seven people on board, is believed to have crashed onto a running track. The other, a Fennec M502-6 carrying the other three victims, crashed into a swimming pool nearby. The states fire and rescue department said it was alerted to the incident at 09:50 local time (01:50 GMT). Malaysias Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim said in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter, that the nation mourns the heart-wrenching and soul-wrenching tragedy. Condolences to all the families of the victims and prayers for strength to face this calamity, he said.

        "content": "A seven-member panel led by a Major General has been appointed to investigate the deadly accident that happened during the Fox Hill Super Cross 2024 racing event in Diyatalawa, Sri Lanka Army says. As many as seven people including an 8-year-old girl lost their lives and more than 20 were injured on Sunday (21) after a car ran off the track during a race and ploughed into spectators. Among the deceased were four event officials who had been stationed as flag marshals. The others were identified as spectators. Reportedly, the crash happened soon after another car had overturned on the track. As the vehicles were speeding past, one red car veered off course and crashed into spectators on the side of the unguarded track. Two drivers of the racing cars involved in the accident were subsequently arrested and remanded until 30 April on the orders of Bandarawela Magistrates Court. Foxhill Supercross, organized by Sri Lanka Military Academy in Diyatalawa with the support of the Sri Lanka Automobile Sports (SLAS), is participated by both local and international top ranking racing drivers and riders.

        "title": "UK parliament approves Rwanda deportation bill, ending weeks of legislative stalemate",
        "date": "April 23, 2024 12:26 pm",
        "content": "British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak s latest effort to send some migrants to Rwanda finally won approval from Parliament early Tuesday, hours after he pledged deportation flights would begin in July. The parliamentary logjam that had stalled the legislation for two months was finally broken just after midnight when the unelected House of Lords recognized the primacy of the elected House of Commons and dropped the last of its proposed amendments, clearing the way for the bill to become law. Earlier in the day, Sunak held a rare morning press conference to demand that the Lords stop blocking his key proposal for ending the tide of migrants crossing the English Channel in small boats, promising that both houses of Parliament would remain in session until it was approved. The legislative stalemate was just the latest hurdle to delay implementation of a plan that has been repeatedly blocked by a series of court rulings and opposition from human rights activists who say it is illegal and inhumane. Migrant advocates have vowed to continue the fight against it. For almost two years, our opponents have used every trick in the book to block fights and keep the boats coming, Sunak told reporters Monday morning in London. But enough is enough. No more prevarication, no more delay. The government plans to deport to Rwanda some of those who enter the United Kingdom illegally as a deterrent to migrants who risk their lives in leaky, inflatable boats in hopes that they will be able to claim asylum once they reach Britain. Despite Parliaments approval of the legislation, further court challenges may still delay the deportation flights, said Tim Bale, a politics professor at Queen Mary University of London. I dont think it is necessarily home and dry, he said. We will see some attempts to block deportations legally. Sunak has staked his political future to the deportation flights, making a pledge to stop the boats a key part of his pitch to voters as opinion polls show that his Conservative Party trails far behind the Labour Party ahead of a general election later this year. Next weeks local elections are seen as a barometer for how the parties will fare in the general election. The debate in Britain comes as countries throughout Western Europe and North America look for ways to slow the rising number of migrants as war, climate change and political oppression force people from their homes. Small boat crossings are a potent political issue in Britain, where they are seen as evidence of the governments failure to control immigration. The number of migrants arriving in Britain on small boats soared to 45,774 in 2022 from just 299 four years earlier as people seeking refuge pay criminal gangs thousands of pounds (dollars) to ferry them across the channel. Last year, small boat arrivals dropped to 29,437 as the government cracked down on people smugglers and reached an agreement to return Albanians to their home country. I think the most important takeaway is quite how desperate the government clearly is to get this piece of legislation through on the grounds that it will enable it to at least make a down payment on its promise to stop the boats, Bale said. While Sunak acknowledged that he wouldnt meet his original deadline of getting the first deportation flights in the air this spring, he blamed the delays on continued resistance from the opposition Labour Party. On Monday, Sunak said the first flights would take off in 10-12 weeks but refused to provide details about how many people would be deported or exactly when the flights would occur because he said that information could help opponents continue to try to frustrate the policy. In preparation for the bills approval, the government has already chartered planes for the deportation flights, increased detention space, hired more immigration caseworkers and freed up court space to handle appeals, Sunak said. He also suggested the government was prepared to ignore the European Court of Human Rights if it sought to block the deportations. We are ready, plans are in place, and these flights will go come what may, Sunak said. No foreign court will stop us from getting flights off. The current legislation, known as the Safety of Rwanda Bill, is a response to a U.K. Supreme Court decision that blocked the deportation flights because the government couldnt guarantee the safety of migrants sent to Rwanda. After signing a new treaty with Rwanda to beef up protections for migrants, the government proposed the new legislation declaring Rwanda to be a safe country. The bill has been stalled in the idiosyncrasies of the British legislative system. The House of Lords is charged with scrutinizing and offering amendments to measures approved by the House of Commons, but it doesnt have the power to block legislation outright. As a result, the Rwanda bill bounced back and forth between the two houses of Parliament, with the Lords repeatedly offering amendments only for them to be rejected by the Commons, which then sent the legislation back to the upper house. Critics of the governments policy refused to be drawn on their next move. James Wilson, the director of Detention Action, which campaigns against human rights abuses in the immigration system, urged the public to look past the political stalemate and remember what is at stake. Ultimately, the most important points here are not the ins and outs of Parliament, and the things that are happening there, he told The Associated Press. In the end, this is about people. This is about peoples lives. Source: Associated Press -Agencies",

Powering Sri Lanka to the highest successful run-chase in womens ODIs has seen Chamari Athapaththu go to the top of the ICC Womens ODI Batting Rankings in the latest update. Athapaththus stellar knock in the third and final ODI helped Sri Lanka level the three-match series in South Africa. Chasing a record target of 302 to win, Athapaththu led Sri Lankas fightback with a brilliant 195, the third-highest score in womens ODIs. Its also the second-highest score by anyone in a successful run chase in ODI cricket - mens and womens - right behind Glenn Maxwells 201 against Afghanistan in the ICC Mens Cricket World Cup 2023. The knock saw Athapaththu achieve her highest-ever rating (773) in the womens batting rankings. The Sri Lankan also jumped two spots in the all-rounder rankings to enter the top 10 at ninth position. Meanwhile, Laura Wolvaardt, who also shone with back-to-back ODI tons in the series against Sri Lanka, including a career-high of 184 that eventually went in vain, rose to third position in the batting rankings. Hayley Matthews benefitted from knocks of 140 and 44 in Pakistan to go up by seven places and finish joint-eleventh in the batting rankings. She also jumped three places in the womens ODI all-rounder rankings to go to second position behind Marizanne Kapp. Shemaine Campbelle (up by 17 places to 54th) and Chinelle Henry (up by 11 places to 65th) were the other beneficiaries in the batting rankings. Pakistan spinner Sadia Iqbal rose up by six places and entered the top 20 of the ODI bowling rankings after her impressive showing in the first two games of the series. West Indies duo of Afy Fletcher (up by nine places to 26th) and Henry (up by six places to joint 36th) also made good ground in the bowling rankings. Sri Lanka spinner Kavisha Dilhari (up seven places to 48th) and Pakistans Umm-e-Hani (up nine places to joint 60th) were the other movers in the ODI bowling rankings. There was no major movement in the top 10 in the Womens T20I player rankings. Ireland seam bowling duo Ava Canning (up by 15 places to joint 53rd) and Alana Dalzell (up by 12 places to joint 79th) benefitted from their showing in the bilateral series against Thailand women. Laura Delany also pipped Sophie Ecclestone in the womens T20I all-rounder rankings to finish on 12th with career-high rating points of 213. --ICC",

        "date": "April 23, 2024 05:40 pm",
        "content": "Minister of Power and Energy Kanchana Wijesekera says the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) incurred a loss to the tune of Rs. 9.8 billion per annum as a result of the delays in the construction and commissioning of the Uma Oya hydropower plant. The delays in the construction and commissioning of the hydropower plant due to various politically motivated protests is estimated to be a loss of Rs 9.8 Billion per annum to the CEB. The hydropower plant project was scheduled to be commissioned in December 2015, the lawmaker said in a post on X (formerly Twitter). Wijesekeras remarks came after a meeting with the Managing Director, Chairman of the Board and the officials of the FARAB Group, an Iran-based contractor, as well as the Iranian Energy Ministry officials on Monday (22). FARAB is the construction and engineering partner of the Uma Oya Multipurpose Development Project (UOMDP). With the commissioning of the Uma Oya hydropower plant tomorrow (24), a generation capacity of 120MW will be added to the national grid while reducing the cost of energy. Wijesekera added that the project would also provide water requirements for drinking, agricultural and irrigational requirements for beneficiaries in three districts. President Ranil Wickremesinghe and his Iranian counterpart Dr. Ebrahim Raisi are scheduled to jointly declare open the UOMDP tomorrow (24). The Iranian President is currently on a three-day trip to neighbouring Pakistan as part of efforts by both countries to mend relations that were strained earlier this year. He will arrive on the island nation after wrapping up his Pakistani visit. The government says that in addition to generating 120MW of hydroelectric power, the UOMDP is also able to supply water to paddy fields during both the Yala and Maha seasons and to provide a sustainable solution to the drinking water needs of the Badulla, Monaragala and Bandarawela areas. UOMDP includes the components of the construction of two dams across Uma Oya and a tributary at Welimada, a trans-basin diversion tunnel, an underground hydropower plant of 120MW installed capacity, diversion of 145MCM of water to irrigate agricultural land in Hambantota and Monaragala districts and other downstream requirements. The expected annual energy production is 290 GWh. The power plant will be connected via a 22.7km length 132kV Transmission line to Badulla Grid Substation.",

        "content": "U.N. rights chief Volker Turk said on Tuesday that he was horrified by the destruction of the Nasser and Al Shifa medical facilities in Gaza and reports of mass graves containing hundreds of bodies there, according to a spokesperson. Palestinian authorities reported finding scores of bodies in mass graves at Nasser hospital in Khan Younis this week after it was abandoned by Israeli troops. Bodies were also reported at the Al Shifa site following an Israeli special forces operation. We feel the need to raise the alarm because clearly there have been multiple bodies discovered, said Ravina Shamdasani, the spokesperson for the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, adding Turk said he had been horrified by the reported mass grave discoveries and the hospitals destruction. Some of them had their hands tied, which of course indicates serious violations of international human rights law and international humanitarian law, and these need to be subjected to further investigations. She added that the U.N. human rights office was working on corroborating Palestinian officials reports that 283 bodies were found at Nasser and 30 at Al Shifa. According to those reports, some of the bodies were buried beneath piles of waste and included women and older people. Gazas Hamas-run Civil Emergency Service said on Tuesday that a total of 310 bodies had been found at one mass grave at Nasser so far and that two other graves had been identified, but not yet excavated. Israels military and its diplomatic mission in Geneva were not immediately available for comment on the Jewish Passover holiday. Israel says Hamas militants use hospitals as bases and that its forces killed around 200 militants at Al Shifa and avoided harming any civilians. Turk, who was represented by Shamdasani at a U.N. press briefing, also decried Israeli strikes on Gaza in recent days, which he said had killed mostly women and children. He also repeated a warning against a full-scale incursion on Rafah where some 1.2 million civilians are crowded together, saying this could lead to further atrocity crimes. Violence has also surged in the occupied West Bank since Israels war on Hamas began on Oct. 7, sparked by the latters cross-border attacks on Israel which killed 1,200 people according to Israeli tallies. Palestinian health authorities said 14 Palestinians had been killed on Saturday in the Nur Shams area in one of the heaviest tolls in the West Bank in months. Shamdasani said the U.N. human rights office had received reports that some the victims in Nur Shams had been killed in apparent extrajudicial executions. Israels military has previously said a number of militants were killed or arrested in the West Bank raid and at least four soldiers wounded. Source: Reuters -Agencies",

        "date": "April 23, 2024 09:59 pm",
        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe emphasized the peril of politicizing education, warning that such a move would inevitably lead to the nations downfall. He urged all stakeholders to set aside personal biases and engage in collaborative discussions to devise the most effective education system for the country within the next two to three years. These remarks were made during his address at the 10th Biennial Conference of the All Island Professional Lecturers Association (APLA), held at the Nelum Pokuna Theater in Colombo this afternoon (23). The All Island Professional Lecturers Association (APLA), established in 2004 by a consortium of tuition teachers nationwide, convened the event. Dr. K. Ariyasinghe, a founding member of the All Island Professional Lecturers Association, along with other senior teachers, was presented with the Senior Lecturers Award by the President. Mr. Ravindra Bandara, President of the Association, presented a commemorative gift to President Ranil Wickremesinghe, the chief guest of the conference. Following this, the President joined the executive committee members of APLA for a group photograph. President Wickremesinghe further elaborated that the governments forthcoming education reforms would not solely involve education experts but would also welcome input from school teachers, professionals in the economic sector, and organizations like the APLA. Addressing the event, he reiterated the importance of inclusive dialogue in shaping the future of education in the country. Speaking further, President Wickremesinghe said: In 1981, as Minister of Education, I authored the White Paper amidst widespread calls for the prohibition of private classes. At the time, we firmly opposed such a measure. The fundamental mission of the Ministry of Education is to ensure quality education for every child. Over time, the supplementary class system emerged in our country and has since made significant strides. This development was driven by the shortcomings in our education sector and the intrusion of politics, which hindered effective problem-solving. Consequently, students and parents turned to supplementary classes as an alternative. However, today, there is a symbiotic relationship between mainstream schooling and supplementary classes. Particularly notable was the discussion surrounding the provision of education through online technology during the recent pandemic. Back in 2017, we proposed to the Ministry of Education the distribution of tablets to high school students for online learning, with the necessary funding allocated. Unfortunately, the project was shelved due to objections. Had it been implemented then, online education could have commenced earlier. Nevertheless, I commend the initiation of this project by the All Island Professional Lecturers Association. In many nations worldwide, the traditional schooling system and supplementary classes are intertwined. Weve gleaned valuable insights from the recent economic downturn and are steadily recovering. However, we must forge ahead with a new economic paradigm, one centered on exports and marked by fierce competitiveness. Simultaneously, we must strive for economic growth that alleviates poverty. In addition to these considerations, its imperative to craft an education system that aligns with our countrys needs. We must delve into the dynamics between formal schooling and extracurricular activities, while also exploring the integration of technology and artificial intelligence into education. Presently, technology is driving significant changes in education, and its crucial that we embrace and adapt to this transformation. One of the legacies of British colonial rule was the introduction of schools modeled on the British system, spearheaded by Colebrooke. This initiative led to the establishment of government, missionary, and Buddhist schools. Consequently, prior to India, Sri Lanka pioneered Western-style education in Asia. Moreover, Sri Lanka was among the first to implement free education. Therefore, over the next two to three years, we must strategize on incorporating this new technology into our education system. We need to envision a modern education framework tailored for 2050, rather than 2030. These educational reforms must not be confined to the domain of education experts alone. General educators, representatives from the economic sector, and organizations like the All Island Professional Lecturers Association should also actively participate. The discourse on educational reform should be inclusive, with every idea given due consideration. Politics should not overshadow education; turning it into a mere tool for political maneuvering achieves nothing. Ultimately, its the nation that suffers. Hence, its imperative for everyone to transcend political divides and collaborate towards shaping the future of education collectively. We are actively striving to make the requisite arrangements for this endeavour. Consequently, over the next two to three years, it is imperative that we engage in discussions to determine the optimal education system for our country by the year 2050. Furthermore, we must remain adaptable to ongoing technological advancements beyond that time-frame. --PMD",

        "content": "Sri Lanka and Iran will sign five Memorandums of Understanding (MoUs) today, in a bid to bolster the bilateral relations between the two nations. The signing of the agreements will coincide with the one-day visit of Iranian President Dr. Ebrahim Raisi, the Presidents Media Division (PMD) said. At the invitation of President Ranil Wickremesinghe, the Iranian president is set to arrive in Sri Lanka today after wrapping up his three-day visit to neighbouring Pakistan. This is the first visit of an Iranian President to Sri Lanka since former President Dr. Mahmoud Ahmadinejads visit in April 2008. During his brief visit to the island nation, Dr. Raisi, together with President Ranil Wickremesinghe, will participate in a public ceremony to mark the inauguration of the Uma Oya Multipurpose Development Project (UOMDP). Meanwhile, Sri Lanka Police has implemented special traffic plans in Colombo and Mattala ahead of the Iranian presidents arrival. The vehicular movement will be restricted on many roads including the Colombo-Katunayake expressway and the main road from Mattala to Uma Oya. UOMDP, following the Mahaweli Development Project, is one of the largest irrigation projects in Sri Lanka. Its primary objective is to alleviate water scarcity in the southeastern dry region of the country by redirecting an annual average of 145 million cubic meters (MCM) of excess water from the Uma Oya basin to the Kirindi Oya basin, the PMD said. Owing to the project, approximately 4,500 hectares of new land and 1,500 hectares of existing agricultural land in the Monaragala District will receive irrigation water. Moreover, the areas of Badulla, Monaragala, and Hambantota will benefit from 39 million cubic meters (MCM) of water for drinking and industrial purposes, while generating and adding 290 GWh of electrical energy annually to the National Grid. The project encompasses the construction of two reservoirs at Puhulpola and Dyraaba, a conveyance tunnel (Link Tunnel) spanning 3.98 kilometers to connect the two reservoirs, a 15.2-kilometer-long Head Race Tunnel, Surge Shaft, Pressure Shaft, Underground Powerhouse, Switchyard, Transmission line, Tailrace Tunnel, and related infrastructure. Pursuant to a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) executed between the Sri Lanka and Iran on 27 November 2007, the Cabinet of Ministers had approved the execution of the contract agreement between the executing agency, Ministry of Irrigation and Water Management of Sri Lanka and Farab Energy and Water Projects (Farab Company) of Iran dated 28 April 2008 to implement the UOMDP by Farab Company, as an Engineering, Procurement and Construction (EPC) contract.",

        "date": "April 24, 2024 10:05 am",
        "content": "The US Senate has approved a controversial landmark bill that could see TikTok banned in America. It gives TikToks Chinese owner, ByteDance, nine months to sell its stake or the app will be blocked in the United States. The bill will now be handed over to US President Joe Biden who has said he will sign it into law as soon as it reaches his desk. ByteDance has told the BBC that it did not have an immediate response to the move. Previously the firm said it would oppose any attempt to force it to sell TikTok. If the US is successful in forcing ByteDance to sell TikTok any deal would still need approval from Chinese officials but Beijing has vowed to oppose any such move. Analysts say the process could take years. The measure was passed as part of a package of four bills which also included military aid for Ukraine, Israel, Taiwan and other US partners in the Indo- Pacific. It got widespread support from lawmakers with 79 Senators voting for it and 18 voting against it. For years weve allowed the Chinese Communist party to control one of the most popular apps in America that was dangerously short-sighted, said Senator Marco Rubio, the top Republican on the Intelligence Committee. A new law is going to require its Chinese owner to sell the app. This is a good move for America, he added. TikTok did not immediately respond to a BBC request for comment. Last week, the social media company said the bill would trample the free speech rights of 170 million Americans, devastate seven million businesses, and shutter a platform that contributes 24 billion to the US economy, annually. TikToks chief executive, Shou Zi Chew, said last month the company will continue to do all it can including exercising its legal rights to protect the platform. University of Richmond law professor, Carl Tobias told the BBC that a prolonged legal battle is likely to follow and that could take about two years. He also said if a buyer for ByteDances stake is not found within the nine-month period, it could delay any action against TikTok in the US further. Fears that data about millions of Americans could land in Chinas hands have driven Congressional efforts to split TikTok from the Beijing-based company. TikTok has said ByteDance is not an agent of China or any other country. And ByteDance insists it is not a Chinese firm, pointing to the global investment firms that own 60 of it.

        "date": "April 24, 2024 11:45 am",
        "content": "Argentina has asked Interpol to arrest Irans interior minister over the 1994 bombing of a Jewish community center in Buenos Aires that killed 85 people, the foreign ministry said Tuesday. The Iranian minister, Ahmad Vahidi, is part of a delegation from Tehran currently visiting Pakistan and Sri Lanka, and Interpol has issued a red alert seeking his arrest at the request of Argentina, the ministry said in a statement. Argentina has also asked those two governments to arrest Vahidi, it added. On April 12, a court in Argentina placed blame on Iran for the 1994 attack against the AMIA Jewish community center in Buenos Aires and for a bombing two years earlier against the Israeli embassy, which killed 29 people. The 1994 assault has never been claimed or solved, but Argentina and Israel have long suspected the Iran-backed group Hezbollah carried it out at Irans request. Prosecutors have charged top Iranian officials with ordering the attack, though Tehran has denied any involvement. The court also implicated Hezbollah and called the attack against the AMIA -- the deadliest in Argentinas history -- a crime against humanity. Tuesdays statement from the foreign ministry said: Argentina seeks the international arrest of those responsible for the AMIA attack of 1994, which killed 85 people, and who remain in their positions with total impunity. One of them is Ahmad Vahidi, sought by Argentine justice as one of those responsible for the attack against AMIA, said the statement, which was co-signed by the security ministry. Argentina has previously stated that Vahidi, a former senior member of Irans Revolutionary Guards Corps, is one of the key masterminds of the AMIA bombing and sought his extradition. Decades-long probe In their ruling this month the Argentine judges examined the geopolitical context at the time of the attacks and found they corresponded with foreign policy positions towards Iran under Argentinas then-president Carlos Menem (1989-1999). The attacks origin lies mainly in the unilateral decision of the government -- motivated by a change in our countrys foreign policy between late 1991 and mid-1992 -- to cancel three contracts for the supply of nuclear equipment and technology concluded with Iran, the court concluded. The judges put blame on Irans then-president Ali Akbar Hashemi Bahramaie Rafsanjani, as well as other Iranian officials and Hezbollah members. In 2006 Argentine courts requested the extradition of eight Iranians including Rafsanjani and Vahidi, who served as defense minister when Mahmud Ahmadinejad was president. In 2013 then president Cristina Kirchner signed a memorandum with Iran under which Argentine prosecutors could question the suspects outside Argentina. The Jewish community in Argentina expressed outrage and accused the president of orchestrating a cover up. A prosecutor named Alberto Nisman opened an investigation in 2015 when Kirchner was in the final year of her second term. Just before he was due to testify before Congress, Nisman was found dead with a gunshot to the head. The cause of death -- suicide or murder -- remains a mystery. The Argentina justice system eventually dropped its probe of Kirchner. Source: AFP -Agencies",

        "content": "Sri Lankan President Ranil Wickremesinghe and Iranian President Dr. Ebrahim Raisi jointly inaugurated the Uma Oya Multipurpose Development Project (UOMDP) on Wednesday (24). Dr. Raisi arrived on the island nation on Wednesday morning via the Mattala International Airport, where he was accorded a warm welcome by Prime Minister Dinesh Gunawardena. His visit comes after a special invitation extended by his Sri Lankan counterpart, marking the first visit of an Iranian President to Sri Lanka since former President Dr. Mahmoud Ahmadinejads visit in April 2008.

Thanks to the UOMDP, approximately 4,500 hectares of new land and 1,500 hectares of existing agricultural land in the Monaragala District will receive irrigation water. Moreover, the areas of Badulla, Monaragala, and Hambantota will benefit from 39 million cubic meters (MCM) of water for drinking and industrial purposes, while generating and adding 290 GWh of electrical energy annually to the National Grid. The project encompasses the construction of two reservoirs at Puhulpola and Dyraaba, a conveyance tunnel (Link Tunnel) spanning 3.98 kilometers to connect the two reservoirs, a 15.2-kilometer-long Head Race Tunnel, Surge Shaft, Pressure Shaft, Underground Powerhouse, Switchyard, Transmission line, Tailrace Tunnel, and related infrastructure. Pursuant to a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) executed between Sri Lanka and Iran on 27 November 2007, the Cabinet of Ministers had approved the execution of the contract agreement between the executing agency, Ministry of Irrigation and Water Management of Sri Lanka and Farab Energy and Water Projects (Farab Company) of Iran dated 28 April 2008 to implement the UOMDP by Farab Company, as an Engineering, Procurement and Construction (EPC) contract. The total contract sums amount to USD 514 million and the contract became effective on 15 March 2010. Initially, the Export Development Bank of Iran (EDBI) funded USD 50 million until 2013. However, due to international sanctions on Iran, they were unable to continue providing funds for the project. Therefore, the Sri Lankan government decided to proceed with the project using government funds while continuing with the same contractor, Farab Company. When UOMDP commenced on 15 March 2010, its scheduled completion date was 15 March 2015. However, due to various factors such as technical issues, particularly unexpected water ingress into the Headrace Tunnel (HRT), social impacts, financial challenges, and disruptions caused by the global Covid-19 pandemic during the construction period, the completion date has been extended to 31 March 2024. Additionally, the overall duration of the project, including the defect and liability period, has been extended to 31 March 2025. The project completed its commissioning phase in February and March 2024, successfully synchronizing Units 01 and 02 with the national grid. It then proceeded to complete its trial operations on 1 April 2024. The UOMDP involves significant engineering challenges, particularly due to the 700-meter difference in height between Bandarawela and Wellawaya. Adjusting the tunnel route at such a height is a complex task. Additionally, the construction of a deep pressure shaft to channel water onto turbines is an unprecedented feat. Following the completion of the UOMDP, the project components will be transferred to the operating authorities, namely the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) and the Mahaweli Authority of Sri Lanka (MASL). This transition will occur after the Ministry of Irrigation takes over the project components from the contractor. Once electricity is generated, the water is directed through a tunnel to the Alikota Ara Reservoir, built across a tributary of the Kirindi Oya. From there, it is further diverted to the Handapanagala Reservoir, which has been expanded threefold as part of the project. Additionally, water is channelled to the new Kuda Oya Reservoir, currently under construction on the right bank. These reservoirs facilitate irrigation in areas such as Wellawaya, Maharagama, Thanamalvila, and Balaharutha in the Monaragala District. An irrigation system spanning over 60 meters in length is currently being constructed. It is anticipated that this system will supply irrigation water to 1,500 hectares of already cultivated land and an additional 4,500 hectares of newly developed land, supporting agricultural activities in both the Yala and Maha seasons. The Uma Oya Downstream Development Project, facilitated directly by the Irrigation Department, is poised to alleviate the longstanding water scarcity issues in the Kirindi Oya Basin. Under the guidance of the government, officials have been directed to execute an integrated agricultural development initiative leveraging modern technology to optimize water utilization. Additionally, the UOMDP has effectively addressed the challenge of supplying water for both domestic and industrial purposes in the Bandarawela and Wellawaya regions.",

        "content": "Skies over southern Greece turned an orange hue on Tuesday as dust clouds blown across the Mediterranean Sea from North Africa engulfed the Acropolis and other Athens landmarks. Strong southerly winds carried the dust from the Sahara Desert, giving the atmosphere of the Greek capital a Martian-like filter in the last hours of daylight. The skies are predicted to clear on Wednesday as winds shift and move the dust, with temperatures dipping. On Tuesday, the daily high in parts of the southern island of Crete topped 30 degrees Celsius (86 Fahrenheit), more than 20 degrees C higher than what was registered in much of northern Greece. The strong southerly winds over the past few days have also fanned unseasonal early wildfires in the countrys south. The fire service said Tuesday evening that a total 25 wildfires broke out across the country in the past 24 hours. Three people were arrested on the Aegean Sea resort island of Paros on suspicion of accidentally starting a scrub blaze on Monday, it added. No significant damage or injuries were reported, and the fire was quickly contained. Another blaze that broke out on Crete near a naval base was brought under control Tuesday. Greece suffers devastating, and often deadly, forest blazes every summer, and last year the country recorded the European Unions largest wildfire in more than two decades. Persistent drought combined with high spring temperatures has raised fears of a particularly challenging period for firefighters in the coming months. Source: Associated Press -Agencies",

        "content": "In a glass cage in a Moscow court stands Russias Deputy Defense Minister Timur Ivanov on Wednesday (April 24), a day after he was arrested at work for accepting large bribes. The court remanded him in custody for two months and said Ivanov entered into a criminal conspiracy with third parties to receive property and services while working for the ministry of defense. Ivanov, deputy minister since 2016, was in charge of property management, housing, construction and mortgages. The defense ministry, whose spending has spiraled since the start of the war, has made no comment. As the right hand man of Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu, Ivanovs detention is the highest profile corruption case since Russia sent troops into Ukraine in February 2022. The Kremlin said President Vladimir Putin had been informed, and Shoigu had also been told. Ivanov was present earlier on Tuesday at a meeting of top defense officials chaired by Shoigu. Its triggered speculation about a battle within the elite to crackdown on corruption that has plagued Russias post-Soviet armed forces. Russias Kommersant newspaper said Ivanov was arrested by the Federal Security Service (FSB), the successor to the KGB which Putin last month told to root out corruption in state defense procurement. Ivanov has been the subject of journalistic investigations which allege he and his family live a lavish, luxury lifestyle. Russian military bloggers have accused top generals of corruption and incompetence, after the armys hurried withdrawal from parts of Ukraine due to seriously over-extending itself during the first days of the invasion. Ivanov faces 15 years in jail if convicted. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "title": "UN calls for investigation into mass graves uncovered at two Gaza hospitals raided by Israel",
        "date": "April 24, 2024 11:54 pm",
        "content": "The United Nations called Tuesday for a clear, transparent and credible investigation of mass graves uncovered at two major hospitals in war-torn Gaza that were raided by Israeli troops. Credible investigators must have access to the sites, U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric told reporters, and added that more journalists need to be able to work safely in Gaza to report on the facts. Earlier Tuesday, U.N. human rights chief Volker Türk said he was horrified by the destruction of the Shifa medical center in Gaza City and Nasser Hospital in the southern city of Khan Younis as well as the reported discovery of mass graves in and around the facilities after the Israelis left. He called for independent and transparent investigations into the deaths, saying that given the prevailing climate of impunity, this should include international investigators. Hospitals are entitled to very special protection under international humanitarian law, Türk said. And the intentional killing of civilians, detainees and others who are hors de combat (incapable of engaging in combat) is a war crime. U.S. State Department spokesman Vedant Patel on Tuesday called the reports of mass graves at the hospitals incredibly troubling and said U.S. officials have asked the Israeli government for information. The Israeli military said its forces exhumed bodies that Palestinians had buried earlier as part of its search for the remains of hostages captured by Hamas during its Oct. 7 attack that triggered the war. The military said bodies were examined in a respectful manner and those not belonging to Israeli hostages were returned to their place. The Israeli military says it killed or detained hundreds of militants who had taken shelter inside the two hospital complexes, claims that could not be independently verified. The Palestinian civil defense in the Gaza Strip said Monday that it had uncovered 283 bodies from a temporary burial ground inside the main hospital in Khan Younis that was built when Israeli forces were besieging the facility last month. At the time, people were not able to bury the dead in a cemetery and dug graves in the hospital yard, the group said. The civil defense said some of the bodies were of people killed during the hospital siege. Others were killed when Israeli forces raided the hospital. Palestinian health officials say the hospital raids have destroyed Gazas health sector as it tries to cope with the mounting toll from over six months of war. The issue of who could or should conduct an investigation remains in question. For the United Nations to conduct an investigation, one of its major bodies would have to authorize it, Dujarric said. I think its not for anyone to prejudge the results or who would do it, he said. I think it needs to be an investigation where there is access and there is credibility. The chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, Karim Khan, said after visiting Israel and the West Bank in December that a probe by the court into possible crimes by Hamas militants and Israeli forces is a priority for my office. The discovery of the graves is another reason why we need a cease-fire, why we need to see an end to this conflict, why we need to see greater access for humanitarians, for humanitarian goods, greater protection for hospitals and for the release of Israeli hostages, Dujarric said Monday. In the Hamas attack that launched the war, militants killed about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducted around 250 hostages. Israel says the militants are still holding around 100 hostages and the remains of more than 30 others. In response, Israels air and ground offensive in Gaza, aimed at eliminating Hamas, has killed more than 34,000 Palestinians, according to local health officials, around two-thirds of them children and women. It has devastated Gazas two largest cities, created a humanitarian crisis and led around 80 of the territorys population to flee to other parts of the besieged coastal enclave.

        "date": "April 25, 2024 09:35 am",
        "content": "Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez has suspended public duties to stop and reflect on whether to remain in the job, after a court opened a preliminary inquiry into his wife. In a statement, the Spanish leader said he urgently needed to decide whether I should continue to lead the government or renounce this honour. The court said it was responding to corruption claims against Begoña Gómez. Mr Sánchez said his wife would defend her honour and work with the judiciary. The complaint against Begoña Gómez was raised by anti-corruption campaigners Manos Limpias (Clean Hands), who have taken part in a number of high-profile court cases in recent years and are led by a man linked to the far right. The Spanish prime minister said he would make a decision on his future before the media on Monday 29 April, after reflecting whether it was worth remaining in office despite the mud that the right and far right were trying to turn politics into. In a lengthy statement on X, Mr Sánchez complained of a strategy of harassment over months aimed at weakening him politically and personally targeting his wife. The court did not give details of the accusations against Begoña Gómez other than to say it had begun investigating allegations of influence peddling and corruption on 16 April. However, El Confidencial website said on Wednesday that the inquiry was looking into her links to private companies that had secured government money or public contracts. In particular, it cited a sponsorship agreement involving tourism group Globalia and a foundation she ran in 2020 called IE Africa Center. In 2020, Globalia secured a 475m (407m) bailout for its airline Air Europa, as part of a series of government rescue packages for companies during the Covid-19 crisis. Spains conservative Popular Party (PP) demanded explanations in parliament earlier on Wednesday, to which the prime minister said simply that he believed in justice despite everything. Spanish media said he had left parliament for his Madrid residence visibly upset. Hours later he accused PP leader Alberto Núñez Feijóo of working with far-right party Vox to bring him down. I am not naive. I realise they are denouncing Begoña, not because she has done anything illegal - they know there is no case - but because she is my wife, he complained in his statement. Political allies expressed support for Mr Sánchez, who has been in power since 2018, but his decision to suspend public duties comes at a tense time for his Socialist party ahead of European Parliament elections in June and elections in the Catalonia region of north-eastern Spain next month. He was due to take part in a Catalan campaign launch in Barcelona on Thursday. Pedro Sánchez leads an awkward coalition that includes two Catalan separatist parties, which were persuaded to join the government in return for an amnesty that covered a banned Catalan referendum on secession in 2017. Without the support of the Catalan Republican Left (ERC) and Together for Catalonia (JxCat) he would not have been able to stay in power, following an inconclusive election last year. Opposition parties were outraged by the amnesty, which also means the former Catalan regional leader Carles Puigdemont will stand in next months regional vote, seven years after he fled imminent arrest and went into exile in Belgium. Mr Puigdemont is still facing a terrorism case but believes the amnesty will enable him to return to Spain. Source: BBC -Agencies",

The MP stressed that around 200,000 students, who had submitted applications for re-scrutiny, have encountered various issues concerning the AL subject stream selection as they are still awaiting the finalized results.

        "date": "April 25, 2024 12:57 pm",
        "content": "President Ebrahim Raisi has stated improved relations between Iran and Sri Lanka in various fields would benefit the two countries and the Indian Ocean region. Raisi made the remarks in a joint press conference with Sri Lankan President Ranil Wickremesinghe in the Island nations capital of Colombo on Wednesday. He said that Iran is ready to supply technical and engineering services to Sri Lanka to help the country boost its economic and industrial infrastructure. The president made the comments hours after he opened a large hydroelectric project in Badulla, located some 230 kilometers to the east of Colombo. The Uma Oya Multipurpose Development Project, which is worth over 500 million, has been largely designed and built by Iranian companies to help Sri Lanka overcome its electricity and irrigation problems. He stated Iran had progressed in various fields of technology over the past years despite being subject to a harsh regime of foreign sanctions. He added that Iran and Sri Lanka will soon form an intergovernmental committee to significantly boost their trade and economic ties. The Sri Lanka president, for his part, said in the joint press conference with Raeisi that his country has relied on Irans support to weather a major economic crisis in recent years. Wickremesinghe stressed that Sri Lanka and Iran had agreed during Raeisis visit to teh country to cooperate more on issues related to the Indian Ocean and on joint initiatives in the United Nations. He added that five memorandums of understanding signed earlier in the day between Sri Lankan and Iranian government ministers would lead to a further expansion in relations between the two countries. Raisi arrived in Colombo early on Wednesday after a three-day visit to Pakistan and as part of his administrations drive to boost ties with Asian countries. The short visit to Sri Lanka is the first by an Iranian president in 16 years. Source: IFP --Agencies",

        "date": "April 25, 2024 01:18 pm",
        "content": "Former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa on Thursday (25) vehemently refuted the allegations recently levelled at him by His Eminence Malcolm Cardinal Ranjith concerning the 2019 Easter Sunday terror attacks. In a statement, Rajapaksa addressed four such allegations made by the Cardinal at an event held to mark the 5th anniversary of the carnage that claimed the lives of more than 250 people and left hundreds of others wounded. Responding to the first allegation, the former president said: I categorically state that I did NOT speak to the Cardinal over the phone after the Presidential Commission report was submitted to me and tell him that the recommendations of the Presidential Commission could not be implemented because that would entail the arrest of people and even the banning of organisations allied with me. With respect to the second allegation, Rajapaksa emphasized that there was no delay in handing over to the Cardinal a copy of the first volume of the Presidential Commission of Inquiry (PCoI) report. The report of the Presidential Commission was handed over to me on 1 February 2021. Having studied it myself and referred it to the Attorney General, it was handed over to the Speaker of Parliament on 23 February 2021 and by 1 March 2021 copies had been given to the Venerable Mahanayaka Theras, the Cardinal and the Catholic Bishops. He also clarified that he did not ask the six-member Cabinet sub-committee to selectively implement only a few of the recommendations made by various committees and commissions appointed to inquire into the Easter attacks. The former president further denied having transferred the CID officers probing the Easter attacks and imprisoning one such senior officer in order to sabotage the investigation. Slamming Cardinal Ranjith for continuing to relentlessly attack and criticize him over the Easter Sunday suicide bombings, Rajapaksa said the failure to prevent the attack was a failure of the CID under its then-director.

        "date": "April 25, 2024 04:26 pm",
        "content": "JioCinema, the streaming platform run by Indias Reliance Industries, on Thursday cut prices of its premium offering to as low as 29 rupees (0.3480) a month, heating up competition for Netflix and Amazon Prime. Reliance runs multiple TV channels and JioCinema streaming app through its media unit Viacom18 and has a sizeable hold over Indias 28-billion media and entertainment market. An advertisement-free version would start at an introductory price of 29 rupees per month for streaming on a single device and go up to 89 rupees for a Family plan to stream on four simultaneous devices, JioCinema said in a statement. The platform previously priced its premium offering at 99 rupees (1.19) a month, or 999 rupees a year, for streaming on up to four devices simultaneously. The plan was not ad-free. Existing JioCinema premium members will get all the additional benefits of the Family plan at no extra cost, it said. JioCinema has become popular for showing the IPL cricket tournament for free. The new pricing, it said, is only for premium content, while the matches and many other shows would continue to stream for free. Mukesh Ambani, who runs Indias top conglomerate Reliance Industries, has a reputation of disrupting rivals in the price-sensitive Indian market with cheap offers. Lower prices would place JioCinema in a stronger footing to compete with Netflix and Amazon after an agreement with Disney to merge India TV and streaming assets, and content deals with the likes of Warner Bros Discovery, opens new tab and NBCUniversal. JioCinema hosts popular titles such as Succession and shows featuring the character Harry Potter, alongside a variety of offerings targeting kids including popular Japanese anime series, Pokemon.

        "date": "April 25, 2024 04:49 pm",
        "content": "U.S. prosecutors want Changpeng Zhao, the founder and former chief executive of Binance, the worlds largest cryptocurrency exchange, to serve three years in prison after he pleaded guilty to violating laws against money laundering. Prosecutors made the request in a Tuesday night filing in Seattle federal court. They said sentencing Zhao to twice the maximum 18 months recommended under federal guidelines would reflect the magnitude of his willful violations, and send a message that the right choice, every time, is to comply with the law. Lawyers for Zhao requested probation. U.S. District Judge Richard Jones is expected to sentence Zhao on April 30. Once the most powerful figure in the crypto industry, Zhao, 47, stepped down as Binances chief last November, when he and the exchange admitted to evading anti-money laundering requirements under the Bank Secrecy Act. Binance agreed to a 4.32 billion criminal penalty. Prosecutors said Binance, employing a Wild West model that welcomed criminals, did not report more than 100,000 suspicious transactions with designated terrorist groups including Hamas, al Qaeda and the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, or ISIS. They also said Zhaos platform also supported the sale of child sexual abuse materials and was a recipient of a large portion of ransomware proceeds. He made a business decision that violating U.S. law was the best way to attract users, build his company, and line his pockets, prosecutors said. In seeking leniency, Zhaos lawyers cited the first-time offenders unflinching acceptance of responsibility, his 50 million criminal fine, and that no defendant in a remotely similar case has been imprisoned. They also said Zhao made Binance an industry leader on compliance, despite the initial failures that led to this prosecution. Zhao founded Binance in 2017. He has been free on a 175 million bond, and agreed not to appeal any sentence within federal guidelines. Binances penalty included a 1.81 billion criminal fine and 2.51 billion of restitution. Zhao also paid 50 million to the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission, his lawyers said. The case is U.S. v. Zhao, U.S. District Court, Western District of Washington, No. 23-cr-00179.

        "date": "April 25, 2024 05:50 pm",
        "content": "Chinese state energy giant Sinopec is pushing for greater access to Sri Lankas market, where rival India is also seeking to expand its presence, as it looks to build its first fully-controlled overseas refinery, reflecting a change in the firms global strategy to compensate for slowing demand growth at home. Sinopec, the worlds largest oil refiner, is expected to complete a feasibility study by June for a plant at the Chinese-run Hambantota port, after winning Colombos approval last November, two senior industry sources with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters. While the China-based sources say the investment, which Colombo pegged at 4.5 billion as the countrys largest-ever foreign investment, is commercially driven, neighbouring India is pushing a rival plan to build a fuel products pipeline to the island nation southeast of the subcontinent. Sinopecs effort to build a refinery with a more domestic orientation rather than the export-focused project sought by Sri Lanka, which has not previously been reported, puts it in direct competition with Indias interests in expanding its role as an energy supplier to the country. New Delhi-run Indian Oil Corp is the No.2 fuel supplier to the country, after Sri Lankan government-owned Ceylon Petroleum Corp. Indias foreign ministry and Indian Oil Corp did not respond to requests for comment. Sinopec, which has not publicly spelled out its strategy, is prioritising the Sri Lanka investment and another in Saudi Arabia under a newly launched investment arm, in an effort to leverage its expertise and deep pockets to expand globally as oil demand nears its peak in China as economic growth slows and electric vehicle adoption widens, the sources said. Sinopecs efforts mark a new trend in Chinese oil and gas investments abroad after mergers and acquisitions dried up to just 344 million in 2023, a fraction of the record 31 billion in 2012, according to LSEG data, following the 201415 oil price collapse and as Beijing tightened scrutiny over the finances of its national oil giants. Sinopec is working to finalise details including the plants size and product configuration, while negotiating with Colombo over terms including greater access to the import-reliant Sri Lankan market, an element key for its final investment call, the sources said. The south Asian nation, grappling with a dearth of foreign exchange, has sought a refinery that would deliver 20 of its fuel domestically and export the rest to generate much-needed hard currency. Sri Lankas power and energy minister, Kanchana Wijesekera, told Reuters on Friday that the government is sticking to that requirement. Sinopec, however, believes domestic sales would be more profitable, the two sources said, declining to be identified as the matter is not public. The company is considering either a 160,000 barrel per day (bpd) plant or two 100,000-bpd plants built in phases, which in either case would be geared towards gasoline and diesel fuel, the sources said. Sinopec declined comment. FULL CONTROL Sinopec sees Hambantota as among its top-priority projects, alongside a multi-billion-dollar plan to expand a refinery into a petrochemical complex at the Red Sea port of Yanbu in a joint venture with state-run Saudi Aramco, the two sources said. Compared to its half-owned, higher-cost Yanbu plant built a decade ago and designed to supply the U.S. market, Sinopec could fully leverage its expertise in refinery design, engineering and operation in the Hambantota venture and thus cap overall costs. Sinopec has in recent months sought more flexible terms for the projects domestic marketing share but Colombo has not budged. Sri Lankas only existing refinery, the 38,000 bpd Sapugaskanda plant commissioned in 1969, supplies less than 30 of its fuel needs. Minister Kanchana told Reuters he expects Sinopec to sign an investment agreement by June. CHINA VS INDIA China and India are increasingly vying for influence in Sri Lanka. In 2022, India funnelled in about 4 billion of assistance during Sri Lankas worst financial crisis in decades. Since last year, New Delhi has proposed various energy connectivity projects including a 1.2 billion subsea power line and a fuel pipeline linking India with Sri Lankas Trincomalee port on the east coast, Sri Lanka Power and Energy Ministry Secretary Sulakshana Jayawardena said in late February. India is also deepening its involvement in Sri Lankas power sector with solar projects and grid connectivity. Their dependency on China is not there in energy supplies, said an Indian official directly aware of the pipeline discussions, declining to be identified because he is not authorised to speak with media on the subject. That is a sector where we have a significant stake. That will increase with the pipeline, the Indian official said, adding that there has been significant progress on discussions for the multi-product pipeline, with the two sides seeking to formalise the arrangement as soon as possible. China is a comparative latecomer to Sri Lanka but has since 2010 ploughed 6.7 billion into building the Hambantota port, highways and the countrys only coal power plant in Norochcholai. At Hambantota, state-owned China Merchants Group owns 85 of port operator Hambantota International Port Group under a 99-year lease and earlier this year agreed a 392 million deal to build a logistics and storage hub in Colombo port under Beijings sprawling Belt  Road Initiative. Last September, Sinopec started a fuel import and distribution business in Sri Lanka with 150 petrol stations, sourcing fuel mostly from Singapore, which Colombo expected to save the government about 500 million in foreign exchange over the next two years.

        "date": "April 25, 2024 09:50 pm",
        "content": "(Reuters) - Former Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad is among individuals being investigated in connection with a graft probe involving his sons, the head of Malaysias Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) said on Thursday. The investigation comes amid a widening crackdown on graft involving prominent political figures, including those seen as close to 98-year-old veteran leader Mahathir, a long-time foe of current Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim. Anwar has denied targeting political rivals, saying the investigations are part of the governments efforts to tackle high-level corruption. The MACC in January served Mahathirs businessmen sons, Mirzan and Mokhzani, with notices to declare their wealth as part of investigations into offshore financial and business records revealed by a group of news organisations. The MACCs chief commissioner, Azam Baki, on Thursday declined to elaborate on the investigations facing Mahathir or his sons. Let the investigations conclude first, until an appropriate time when we can state the findings of the case, he told reporters in televised remarks. Mahathirs office had no immediate comment. The ex-premier has previously described the investigation against his sons as politically motivated. Mahathir, who has served as prime minister twice since 1981, has been locked in a rivalry with his one-time protege Anwar that has dominated Malaysian politics for decades. Anwar became prime minister in 2022 after more than 20 years as an opposition leader, vowing to combat graft and focus on the economy. But he has faced questions over his commitment to reforms, following a string of dropped corruption cases involving figures allied to his coalition. Anwar has repeatedly maintained he does not interfere in court cases. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "title": "Japan provides 3M through FAO to strengthen inland fisheries in Sri Lanka",
        "date": "April 25, 2024 10:39 pm",
        "content": "The Japanese Government has provided a grant of US3 million through the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), to strengthen inland fisheries and improve rural livelihoods in partnership with the Ministry of Fisheries of Sri Lanka. The US 3 million initiative will bolster food and nutritional security and fortify resilience by establishing four community operated mini hatcheries in Batticaloa, Mullaitivu, Anuradhapura and Monaragala districts, upgrade four NAQDA Aquaculture Development Centres and one community operated mini fish breeding centre to increase breeding and rearing capacity, enhance fingerling stocks in selected reservoirs, develop broodstock for breeding units and promote cage culture for seed rearing among fisher communities. The one-year project will also provide 3 live fish transportation trucks to NAQDA to transport fingerlings, integrate digital technology to inland fisheries, and enhance the technical capacities of officers and fishers in the production, management, processing and value addition of inland fisheries. In his speech, Ambassador Mizukoshi stressed Japan and Sri Lanka, both island nations, share a deep-rooted appreciation for the importance of fisheries in our economies and cultures. Recognizing this shared significance, Japan has been steadfast in its commitment to supporting Sri Lankas fisheries development, particularly in the maritime domain, since 2023. With the initiation of this new project alongside our continued efforts, Japan is committed to strengthening Sri Lankas fisheries sector, thereby improving food security and livelihoods. Sri Lankas inland fisheries sector has historically been supported by the government, contributing significantly to the nations economy, remarked Hon. Douglas Devananda, Minister of Fisheries. However, recent financial challenges have left the sector deprived of necessary resources, exacerbating hardships among inland fishing communities and rural populations. This project is a pivotal step towards revitalizing the sector and ensuring sustainable benefits for all stakeholders involved. The project aims to directly support approximately 3,000 inland fishers, 40 farmers engaged in mini hatchery operations, and 20 farmers specializing in fish feed preparation. Moreover, it is expected to have a positive ripple effect on indirect beneficiaries, including family members, consumers, producers of dry fish, and stakeholders in research and academia. Partnerships like these demonstrate the impact of collective action in driving sustainable development. At the United Nations, we are committed to fostering collaborations that empower communities and reinforce crucial sectors like inland fisheries. Through this project, were not just promoting food security and rural livelihoods; were also laying the groundwork for a resilient future for Sri Lankas rural communities, said Mr. Marc-André Franche, UN Resident Coordinator for Sri Lanka. The significance of increasing inland fish production and ensuring the sustainability of the inland fisheries industry cannot be overstated, stated Mr Vimlendra Sharan, FAO Representative for Sri Lanka. This project is not merely about enhancing food security; its about uplifting livelihoods and fortifying the resilience of rural communities, particularly inland fisherfolk. The development of self-sustained culture-based fisheries in selected reservoirs is not just necessary; its imperative for the betterment of these communities. FAO said it remains steadfast in its commitment to the successful implementation of this project, aiming to create lasting positive impacts on food security, livelihoods, and resilience in Sri Lankas rural communities.",
