        "date": "July 6, 2023 08:49 am",
        "content": "Sri Lankas gross official reserves is estimated at around US dollars 3.5 billion as at end of June 2023, including the swap facility from the Peoples Bank of China, according to the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL). In its latest monetary policy review issues today, the central bank noted that the trade deficit decreased notably during the five months ending May 2023 with a significant decrease in merchandise imports, despite some setback in merchandise exports, reflecting the moderation of global demand. The liquidity conditions in the domestic foreign exchange market continued to improve in recent months supported by increased forex inflows, it said. Earnings from tourism as well as workers remittances are expected to have increased substantially during the first half of 2023, compared to the corresponding period of 2022 and this momentum is expected to continue going forward, the CBSL forecasted. A notable increase in net foreign investment inflows was recorded in the government securities market. The Government received funds from multilateral agencies for budget support and further inflows are expected during the remainder of the year. With improved forex flows and market sentiments, the Sri Lanka rupee appreciated by around 19 per cent against the US dollar thus far during the year. Moreover, the Central Bank said it was able to accumulate a sizeable amount of foreign exchange from the domestic foreign exchange market. Accordingly, the level of gross official reserves is estimated at around US dollars 3.5 billion as at end June 2023, including the swap facility from the Peoples Bank of China, the CBSL said.",

        "date": "July 6, 2023 10:11 am",
        "content": "Fitch Ratings has downgraded Sri Lankas Long-Term Local-Currency (LTLC) Issuer Default Rating (IDR) to C from CC. The issue ratings on local-currency bonds have also been downgraded to C from CC. The Long-Term Foreign-Currency (LTFC) IDR has been affirmed at RD (Restricted Default) and the Country Ceiling at B-. The downgrade of Sri Lankas LTLC IDR reflects Fitchs view that a sovereign local-currency debt restructuring process has begun, as parliament approved the governments domestic debt restructuring plan on 1 July. On 4 July, the authorities launched a formal exchange offer to bondholders for those bonds that are eligible for the restructuring. The debt restructuring announcement outlines a domestic debt optimisation (DDO) strategy, which includes treatment of Sri Lankas domestic debt as well as domestically issued foreign-currency debt. The key elements of the DDO includ: conversion of CBSLs T-bills and provisional advances to the government into treasury bonds (T-bonds); exchange of superannuation funds T-bonds into longer maturity T-bonds; exchange of outstanding Sri Lanka development bonds (SLDBs), which are US-dollar denominated but governed by local law, into new US dollar or Sri Lankan rupee instruments; and, restructuring of local-law foreign-currency denominated bank loans of the government. The debt restructuring excludes banks holdings of Sri Lankan rupee-denominated treasury securities, but bank holdings of SLDBs will be affected. In Fitchs view, the proposed DDO will qualify as a distressed debt exchange (DDE) under its criteria, as it entails a material reduction in terms and is needed to avoid a traditional payment default. We will downgrade the LTLC IDR to RD upon closing of the exchange offer and following confirmation that the exchange will be executed, the rating agency said. The government plans to complete the exchange within July.",

        "title": "Colombo gears up for the largest Indian tourism conference",
        "date": "July 6, 2023 10:57 am",
        "content": "The convention of the Travel Agents Association of India, after an 18-year hiatus, is scheduled to be held in Sri Lankas capital Colombo from July 6 to 9 with over 700 participants primarily from India, RRM Lilani wrote the report. The historical connection between India and Sri Lanka, spanning thousands of years, adds to the significance of the 67th Convention of the TAAI. TAAIs 2022 Convention, originally planned for April 19 to 22 in Colombo, was postponed due to political unrest and economic crisis but today, as Sri Lanka is on its revival path, the Convention has been brought to Sri Lanka to promote a regional tourism network. Sri Lanka Tourism said that India continues to lead among the top ten markets, with the number of Indian tourist arrivals expected to double by 2023. To promote Sri Lankas attractions, cultural value, and travel opportunities, Sri Lanka hosts roadshows in India to create a positive perception among Indian tourists. In Colombo, TAAI, the largest and oldest tourism agency in India, is set to showcase the theme of Futuristic Focus on Transcending Borders and emphasize Sri Lankas position as a safe, convenient, and welcoming destination for Indian tourists, at the Bandaranaike Memorial International Conference Hall. The convention, in collaboration with the Sri Lanka Tourism Promotion Bureau and the Sri Lanka Association of Inbound Tour Operators, has received strong support from Sri Lankan Airlines. The event would be inaugurated by Sri Lankan President Ranil Wickremesinghe and Prime Minister Dinesh Gunawardena, along with other key dignitaries and delegate members from both countries. The Indian High Commissioner to Sri Lanka, Gopal Bagley, will deliver a welcome address, highlighting the significance of this prestigious event and providing a platform for networking and knowledge sharing among participants from various countries. Prime Minister Gunawardena is scheduled to participate in the event on July 7th. The celebrations and dinner will be hosted at Lemon Trees, the Prime Ministers Residence, providing a unique experience for delegates attending the Indian Travel Congress, according to RRM Lilani. Under the theme Transcending Borders, the convention aims to explore the evolving landscape of the tourism industry, emphasizing the embrace of new adventures and destinations. Sri Lanka has the popular Ramayana Trail, which attracts North Indian tourists, and last year, Sri Lanka Tourism introduced the Murugan Trail for South Indians. The Murugan Trail includes approximately ten places of worship, from the north to the south of Sri Lanka, including the Jaffna Nallur Kandaswamy Kovil and the Kataragama or Kadirgamam Murugan Temple. Lord Shiva is also worshipped as one of the main deities among the South Indian community. India and Sri Lanka share a legacy of historical, cultural, religious, spiritual, and linguistic ties that date back more than 2,500 years. The Cultural Cooperation Agreement signed by the Governments of India and Sri Lanka in 1977 forms the foundation for periodic Cultural Exchange Programs between the two countries, India High Commission noted. Tourism plays a vital role in the bilateral relationship between India and Sri Lanka. The Government of India introduced the e-Tourist Visa (eTV) scheme for Sri Lankan tourists on April 14, 2015, and reduced the visa fee as a goodwill gesture. In 2019, out of a total of 1.91 million tourists, 355,000 tourists arrived from India. Sri Lankan tourists are also among the top ten sources for the Indian tourism market. The tourism sector in Sri Lanka, which was severely affected by the Easter Sunday attacks, received a boost from Indian tourists. India included Sri Lanka in its free visa-on-arrival scheme to further strengthen ties on July 24, 2019. During the Virtual Bilateral Summit held on September 26, 2020, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced a USD 15 million grant assistance for the protection and promotion of Buddhist ties between India and Sri Lanka. This grant is the first of its kind by India and can be utilised for the constructionrenovation of Buddhist monasteries, education of young monks, engagement of Buddhist scholars and clergy, development of Buddhist heritage museums, cultural exchanges, archaeological cooperation, and reciprocal exposition of The Buddhas relics. At the 67th TAAI Convention, Jyoti Mayal, President of TAAI, highlighted the significance of transcending borders in both travel and personal growth. She emphasized the transformative power of tourism in bringing prosperity, peace, and economic development to countries. Mayal stated, As the industry evolves, our minds must evolve too. We need to focus on growth and embrace the future to transform lives. Over the course of the two-day event, various topics related to transcending borders will be discussed. Renowned industry experts such as Arvind Singh, Former Secretary of Tourism, Government of India; Madhavan Menon, Managing Director, Thomas Cook India Limited; Nipun Agarwal, Chief Commercial and Transformation Officer, Air India; and K.B. Kachru, Chairman Emeritus  Principal Advisor - South Asia, Radisson Hotels Group, among others, will deliver speeches on subjects including The Boundless Potential of the Skies, Experiential Travel - A Paradigm Shift in Tourism, NEXTAAI - The TAAI Members Technology Initiative, Differentiating Travel - Perspectives from Industry Experts, Transcending Borders - Strengthening International Relations for a Transformed World, and TAAI - The Road Ahead, as per RRM Lilani. Notable industry experts attending the convention include Ashish Gupta, Consulting CEO, FAITH; Pieter Elbers, CEO Indigo; Amitabh Khosla, Country Director - India, IATA; Praveen Iyer, Co-Founder  Chief Commercial Officer, Akasa Air; Rajeev Bhatia, Chief Commercial Officer, Amadeus India; Vinay Malhotra, Head of Global Sales, Indigo; Richard Nuttall, CEO, Sri Lankan Airlines; Kapil Kaul, CEO and Director, CAPA India; Ajeet Bajaj, Dev Karvat, Founder and CEO, Asego Insurance; G.B. Srithar, Regional Director, India, Middle East  South Asia, Singapore Tourism Board; Commander Nevil Malao, Senior Vice President, JM Baxi  Co.; Noel Swain, COO - Passport, eVisa, Identity  Citizen Services, VFS Global; Sandeep Dwivedi, CEO - InterGlobe Technology Quotient, and many more. Jay Bhatia, Vice President of TAAI, emphasized the significance of the Convention in fostering stronger bilateral relationships between India and Sri Lanka. With the participation of approximately 200 Sri Lankan tourism stakeholders in the B2B sessions, the event serves as an ideal platform for networking and establishing fruitful business relations. These interactions promote inbound and outbound travel between India and Sri Lanka, encouraging tourists to explore new and exciting destinations. Jyoti Mayal, President of TAAI, highlighted the immense potential of the Indian market to become one of the most sought-after destinations globally for outbound travel. The TAAI Convention in Colombo presents an opportunity to explore emerging trends, share insights, and collaborate to shape a future where travel transcends borders and truly transforms lives, she said. As delegates gather in Colombo, let us seize this occasion to embrace these trends and work together toward a more interconnected and transformative travel industry, Mayal added. The main theme of the TAAI 2023 conference is to strengthen the regional tourism industry, aligning with Sri Lankan Airlines regional strategy. Sri Lankas strategic location in the Indian Ocean makes it an ideal hub for connecting countries to the north, east, and west of India. Sri Lanka has become a popular stopover destination for Indian tourists travelling to Asia, Europe, Australia, and the Maldives. Sri Lankan Airlines currently operates 85 weekly flights between various Indian cities and Sri Lanka. Dimuthu Thennakone, Head of International Sales and Distribution at Sri Lankan Airlines, expressed the airlines goal to strengthen relations with India, particularly focusing on leisure and MICE (Meetings, Incentives, Conferences, and Exhibitions) tourists. Sri Lankan Airlines aims to expand its flight operations to several other cities in India in the future and is pleased to collaborate with the TAAI Association to further develop tourism activities between the two countries, he stressed.

        "title": "Zuckerberg-Musk fights first round: Meta launches Twitter Killer Threads app",
        "date": "July 6, 2023 11:09 am",
        "content": "With Twitter already on the ropes, Metas Mark Zuckerberg delivered another blow to Elon Musk on Wednesday, ramping up the tech billionaires rivalry with the launch of Instagrams much-anticipated companion service Threads, a challenger to Twitter. Lets do this. Welcome to Threads, Zuckerberg wrote in his first post on the app, along with a fire emoji. He said the app logged 5 million sign-ups in its first four hours. Much like Twitter, the app features short text posts that users can like, re-post and reply to, although it does not include any direct message capabilities. Posts can be up to 500 characters long and include links, photos and videos up to five minutes long, according to a Meta blog post. It is available in more than 100 countries on both Apples App Store and Googles Play Store, the blog post said. Analysts said investors were salivating over the possibility that Threads ties to Instagram might give it a built-in user base and advertising apparatus. That could siphon ad dollars from Twitter at a time when the microblogging companys new CEO is trying to revive its struggling business. While Threads launched as a standalone app, users can log in using their Instagram credentials and follow the same accounts, potentially making it an easy addition to existing habits for Instagrams more than 2 billion monthly active users. Investors cant help but be a little excited about the prospect that Meta really has a Twitter-Killer, said Danni Hewson, head of financial analysis at investment firm AJ Bell. Meta stock closed up 3 on Wednesday ahead of the launch, outpacing gains by competitor tech companies as the broader market edged down. Threads arrival comes after Zuckerberg and Musk have traded barbs for months and even threatened to fight each other in a real-life mixed martial arts cage match in Las Vegas. The timing is opportune for Meta to land a blow, as months of Musks chaotic decision-making has roiled Twitter. Musk bought Twitter for 44 billion last October, but its value has since plummeted as it faced an exodus of advertisers amid deep staffing cuts and content moderation controversies. Its latest move involved limiting the number of tweets users can read per day. Zuckerberg, in subsequent Threads posts, addressed those challenges. I think there should be a public conversations app with 1 billion people on it. Twitter has had the opportunity to do this but hasnt nailed it. Hopefully we will, he wrote. The integration with Instagram included several nods to privacy considerations. Instagram users who sign up for Threads automatically have a badge affixed to their Instagram profile, but can opt to hide it. They also are given options to choose different privacy settings for each app. Brands like Billboard, HBO, NPR and Netflix had accounts set up within minutes of launch, as did celebrities like Shakira and other well-known personalities such as former Meta Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg. The app did not appear to show any ads, according to a Reuters review. To build up Threads, Meta has been making overtures to social media influencers to attract them to the new app and encouraging them to post at least twice a day, said Ryan Detert, CEO of influencer marketing company Influential. Some thanked the company for early access in their initial posts. The app also benefits from the failure of other would-be Twitter competitors to take advantage of the services stumbles. While a number of burgeoning competitors such as Mastodon, Post, Truth Social and T2 have tried to lure Twitter users away, all remain relatively small so far. Bluesky, a new service backed by Twitter cofounder Jack Dorsey, launched its invite-only beta in February and initially had users clamoring to get access codes. Its website said it had 50,000 users as of April. Dorsey also backed another platform called Nostr. But history is working against Meta. It has suffered multiple failures launching standalone copycat apps in the past, most notably its Lasso app aimed at competing with short video rival TikTok. The company later incorporated a short video tool, Reels, directly into Instagram and more recently wound down its unit tasked with designing experimental apps as part of a cost-cutting drive. Another potential strike against Threads is that the news-oriented culture on Twitter differs from that on Instagram, a more visual platform, said Jasmine Enberg, principal analyst at Insider Intelligence. That cuts against Metas goal in recent years of moving away from news and political content and instead recommending lighter fare in Reels videos. The company has downplayed the importance of news content on its platforms in regulatory battles over proposals to compel payment to journalistic publishers. Still, said Enberg, Meta only needs to convince a quarter of Instagrams users to join Threads in order to rival Twitters size. The reality is that Meta doesnt need to convert Twitter power users into Threads users to succeed, she said. Zuckerberg, responding to a user who predicted Twitters demise about an hour after the Threads launch, cautioned patience. Were only in the opening moments of the first round here, he said.

        "date": "July 6, 2023 11:34 am",
        "content": "Coco Lee, a Hong Kong-born singer and songwriter who had a highly successful career in Asia, has died by suicide, her siblings said Wednesday. She was 48. The star had been suffering from depression for several years, Lees elder sisters Carol and Nancy Lee said in a statement posted on Facebook and Instagram, with her condition deteriorating drastically over the last few months. Although, CoCo sought professional help and did her best to fight depression, sadly that demon inside of her took the better of her, the statement read. Lee attempted suicide at home over the weekend and she was rushed to a hospital, her sister said. They said that she was in a coma and died on Wednesday. Born Ferren Lee in Hong Kong, Lee later moved to the U.S. where she attended middle and high school in San Francisco. She became a singer after winning first runner up in an annual singing competition held by broadcaster TVB in Hong Kong, and released her first album in 1994 at the age of 19. Though Lee initially started off as a Mandopop singer, she later branched out to release albums in Cantonese and English over her nearly 30-year career. She was best known for her powerful voice and live performances. CoCo is also known to have worked tirelessly to open up a new world for Chinese singers in the international music scene, and she went all out to shine for the Chinese, her sisters said in their post. We are proud of her! She also was the first Chinese singer to break into the American market, and her English song Do You Want My Love charted at 4 on Billboards Hot Dance Breakouts chart in December 1999. Lee was the voice of heroine Fa Mulan in the Mandarin version of Disneys Mulan, and also sang the Mandarin version of the movies theme song Reflection. In 2011, Lee married Bruce Rockowitz, a Canadian businessman who is the former CEO of Hong Kong supply chain company Li  Fung. While she had two stepdaughters from her marriage with Rockowitz, Lee didnt have children of her own. In Lees most recent Instagram post, dated Dec. 31, 2022, she shared several pictures of herself, including tattoos of the words love and faith as well as a picture of what appears to be a drainage bag taped to her body. Love  Faith  my two favorite words that I carry strongly in my heart which I desperately needed to get through this incredibly difficult year, she wrote in the caption. Life seemed unbearable at times but I adapted the attitude of a female warrior to face them head on fearlessly, the caption read. In March, she posted about having to relearn how to walk after undergoing surgery for an old leg injury that was triggered after going overboard during a dance practice in October 2022. Successful surgery. Even though Im in a lot of pain and I have to re-learn how to walk again, I know I can do it, she wrote in a Facebook post. Yes I can and I will! Mandopop singer-songwriter Wang Leehom paid tribute to Lee in an Instagram post, describing her as the biggest star whom everyone wanted to work with. In the music industry, Coco Lee broke down international barriers, before any other Chinese singer did, he wrote. Lets always remember her, as a brave pioneer, and an important musical legend. Taiwanese singer Jolin Tsai posted a message on Facebook that read R.I.P., your bright smile will always be remembered. Source - The Associated Press -Agencies",

        "date": "July 6, 2023 12:54 pm",
        "content": "Earths average temperature remained at a record high Wednesday, after two days in which the planet reached unofficial records. Its the latest marker in a series of climate-change-driven extremes. The average global temperature was 17.18 Celsius (62.9 degrees Fahrenheit), according to the University of Maines Climate Reanalyzer, a tool that uses satellite data and computer simulations to measure the worlds condition. That matched a record set Tuesday of 17.18 Celsius (62.9 Fahrenheit), and came after a previous record of 17.01 Celsius (62.6 degrees Fahrenheit) was set Monday. Scientists have warned for months that 2023 could see record heat as human-caused climate change, driven largely by the burning of fossil fuels like coal, natural gas and oil, warmed the atmosphere. They also noted that La Nina, the natural cooling of the ocean that had acted as a counter to that warming, was giving way to El Nino, the reverse phenomenon marked by warming oceans. The North Atlantic has seen record warmth this year. A record like this is another piece of evidence for the now massively supported proposition that global warming is pushing us into a hotter future, said Stanford University climate scientist Chris Field, who was not part of the calculations. University of Maine climate scientist Sean Birkle, creator of the Climate Reanalyzer, said the daily figures are unofficial but a useful snapshot of whats happening in a warming world. While the figures are not an official government record, this is showing us an indication of where we are right now, said National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration chief scientist Sarah Kapnick. And NOAA indicated it will take the figures into consideration for its official record calculations. Even though the dataset used for the unofficial record goes back only to 1979, Kapnick said that given other data, the world is likely seeing the hottest day in several hundred years that weve experienced. Scientists generally use much longer measurements  months, years, decades  to track the Earths warming. But the daily highs are an indication that climate change is reaching uncharted territory. On Wednesday, 38 million Americans were under some kind of heat alert, Kapnick said. That included communities that arent used to feeling such heat. In North Grenville, Ontario, the city turned ice hockey rinks into cooling centers as temperatures Wednesday hit 90 degrees Fahrenheit (32 degrees Celsius), with humidity making it making it feel like 100.4 degrees (38 degrees Celsius). I feel like we live in a tropical country right now, city spokeswoman Jill Sturdy said. It just kind of hits you. The air is so thick. With many places seeing temperatures near 100 degrees Fahrenheit (37.8 degrees Celsius), the average temperature records might not seem very hot. But Tuesdays global high was nearly 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit (a full degree Celsius) higher than the 1979-2000 average, which already tops the 20th- and 19th-century averages. High-temperature records were surpassed this week in Quebec and Peru. Beijing reported nine straight days last week when the temperature exceeded 35 degrees Celsius (95 degrees Fahrenheit). Cities across the U.S. from Medford, Oregon to Tampa, Florida have been hovering at all-time highs, said Zack Taylor, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service. Alan Harris, director of emergency management for Seminole County, Florida, said the county has already exceeded surpassed last year for the amount number of days that theyve activated had their extreme weather plan activated  something that happens when the heat index hits 108 Fahrenheit or greater. Its just been kind of brutally hot for the last week, and now it looks like potentially for two weeks, Harris said. In the U.S., heat advisories include portions of western Oregon, inland far northern California, central New Mexico, Texas, Florida and the coastal Carolinas, according to the National Weather Service Weather Prediction Center. Excessive heat warnings are continuing across southern Arizona and California. Source - The Associated Press -Agencies",

        "content": "An error in the wiring of the automatic signaling system for the railway tracks led to Indias worst train accident of the 21st century  in which at least 288 people were killed and around a thousand injured last month  a preliminary probe has suggested. Negligence on part of the personnel of the signaling and telecommunication department, initially committed in 2015, was not rectified in later years and resulted in confusion during maintenance work on the track hours before the accident, according to a report submitted by the Commissioner Railway Safety and widely cited in Indian media. As a result of the lapse, incorrect signals were sent to the Coromandel Express, the first of the three trains involved in the accident, that sent it on the path of a stationary goods train, triggering a collision and derailment. Minutes later, a third train  also carrying passengers  collided with wagons of the derailed trains on a nearby track. The accident took place on Jun. 2 in the eastern state of Odisha, triggering shockwaves due to the massive number of casualties. The wiring error resulted in personnel at the nearby Bahanaga Bazar station being shown that the first passenger train would continue moving on a free track, even though in reality it was directed towards a side track occupied by the goods train. The report highlighted a series of errors that led to this outcome, from the first lapse in 2015 and the subsequent inspections that failed to correct it, with a special emphasis on 2018, when technicians replaced the system without finding out about the problem. The report discovered that the same error had occurred two weeks before the accident on another railroad in India, but it was rectified in time in that case. The Indian railway network has been undergoing large-scale modernization in recent years, with the inauguration of new stations, semi high-speed trains and new technology to reduce the high accident-risk. In 2021 alone, India registered 17,993 railway-related accidents in which 16,431 people were killed and 1,852 wounded, according to the latest report of the National Crime Records Bureau. Spread over 68,000 kilometers, Indian railways is the fourth largest railway network worldwide by length behind the United States, Russia and China, with around 21,650 trains and 7,349 stations across the country, used by around 23 million daily passengers. Meanwhile, more than 50 bodies remain unclaimed a month after the deadly train crash, BBC reported. While the accident site has since been restored, many families say that theyre unable to find closure as theyre still searching for the bodies of their loved ones. There are 52 bodies in total, and they have been stored in a deep-freeze container. Some of the bodies are in a bad shape, making the identification process even more challenging for families.

        "title": "Sri Lankas central bank expect inflation to drop to 7 in July",
        "date": "July 6, 2023 02:48 pm",
        "content": "The Central Bank of Sri Lanka says inflation is expected to come down to a 7 percent level in July 2023, an official said on Thursday (06 July). The headline inflation is expected to decline further and stabilize around mid-single-digit level or the medium term, and in July, this month, we expect inflation to return to single-digit level, about 7 level, Director of Economic Research at CBSL Dr. P. K. G. Harishchandra told reporters in Colombo. Speaking with regards to the countrys inflation as a whole, Dr. Harishchandra stated that while disinflation continues, the core inflation for the month of June was reported at 9.8, which, for the first time in a few years, was a figure below 10. He further pointed out that this disinflation has been supported by all major categories, including food and energy inflation. Sri Lankas headline, core, food and non-food inflation was reported at 69.8, 50.2, 94.9 and 57.6, respectively, in September 2022, while in June 2023, they were 12.0, 9.8, 4.1 and 16.2, in that order. Comparing this outcome with the quarterly projection forecasted in April 2023, Dr. Harischandra highlighted that disinflation has occurred faster than initially expected over the last three months, mainly due to the falling food and energy inflation. Thus, he noted that as per the revised quarterly projection, inflation is expected to return to mid-single-digit levels in the medium term. He further assured that ongoing disinflation will be supported by several other factors, including the lagged impact of tight monetary and fiscal policies, the expected softening of energy and food prices and their spillover effects, the possible re-pricing of goods and services in light of the exchange rate appreciation and a favourable statistical base effect. Meanwhile, commenting on the recent decision made by CBSLs Monetary Board to further reduce policy interest rates, CBSL Governor Dr. Nandalal Weerasinghe emphasised that all necessary regulatory action will be taken in the event banks fail to pass on the benefits of the interest rate reductions to the public. Earlier today, the Standing Deposit Facility Rate (SDFR) and the Standing Lending Facility Rate (SLFR) of the Central Bank was reduced by 200 basis points (bps) to 11.00 percent and 12.00 percent, respectively.",

        "date": "July 6, 2023 04:04 pm",
        "content": "Emphasising the importance of the recently-approved Domestic Debt Optimising (DDO) strategy, the Sri Lanka Banks Association has highlighted the risk of funds, including the Employees Provident Fund, being compromised if such optimization measures were not taken. Speaking during the 101 Katha programme hosted by the Presidents Media Division (PMD), Mr. Russel Fonseka, the Chief Executive Officer of the Bank of Ceylon and SLBA member, expressed the importance of the DDO strategy, highlighting that the need for such a programme is not a recent development. I want to emphasize that there will be no reduction in treasury bonds. Instead, alternative solutions such as interest rate reductions and debt deferment are being employed. These measures ensure the security of employees funds in EPFETF and other similar funds, he said. Moreover, the Bank of Ceylon CEO said that the government has guaranteed an interest rate of 12 for these funds until 2025, followed by a guaranteed interest rate of 9 until the maturity date. It is true that some may argue that the expected interest income might not be attained. However, the current trend indicates a significant decrease in market interest rates. We hope that the market interest rates align with the government-guaranteed rates for employee funds, he said. He stressed that considering the decrease in inflation, the interest income provided by the government for employee funds is quite substantial. Mr. Fonseka said it is important to note that this interest income issue pertains only to contributory funds, and the reduced amount for other funds will be addressed by the relevant institutions. Therefore, employees will not suffer any loss, he said, adding that it is indeed a positive outcome to receive substantial interest on the right amount of money through domestic credit optimization, rather than losing all the funds. Expressing his views further, Mr. Russel Fonseka said; The need for domestic debt restructuring in Sri Lanka is not a recent development. As a nation, we have been grappling with a substantial gap between our import and export sectors for quite some time. With the exception of a few years after gaining independence, there has been a significant disparity between the money we spend on imports and the revenue generated from exports. To provide some context, in recent years, our annual imports have amounted to approximately twenty billion dollars, while our exports have only yielded twelve billion dollars. As a result, our successive governments resorted to borrowing to cover the deficit. However, due to the continuous cycle of borrowing and the burden of interest payments surpassing our trade balance each year, the country found itself plunged into a severe crisis. Furthermore, loans were also obtained for development activities. As a nation, we borrowed more than our capacity could sustain. The consequences began to manifest by April 2022 when the Governor of the Central Bank had to declare that Sri Lanka was unable to meet its debt obligations. We simply did not possess the required amount of US dollars, and foreign countries were unwilling to provide us with further loans. Consequently, the credit crunch had a profound impact on our economy. In the aftermath, the countrys business owners and industrialists faced a challenging situation, with some even losing their jobs. This predicament eventually evolved into a social problem, leading to widespread protests and civil unrest. Ultimately, the government sought assistance from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to alleviate the crisis. To be clear, we lack the necessary income to repay our debts. Therefore, before we can begin the process of repaying the loans, we must establish a suitable arrangement. This is where the restructuring of domestic debt comes into play. As part of this process, a debt burden of 84 billion US dollars, encompassing both domestic and foreign loans, has been addressed. However, Sri Lankas economic capacity was insufficient to repay this colossal sum of 84 billion dollars. The interest on these loans continued to accumulate each year, further exacerbating the economic crisis we faced. Consequently, we had to devise a viable solution to tackle this 84 billion dollar debt burden. In restructuring our foreign loans, it is imperative to reach agreements with the countries that provided those loans, potentially leading to a partial write-off of the debt. During this debt write-off process, the significance of restructuring our domestic debt became evident. Foreign creditors express the need for restructuring not only their loans but also our domestic debt, emphasizing that they are willing to bear their own losses but expect us to bear comparable losses as well. It brings me great satisfaction to see the government, the Ministry of Finance, and the International Monetary Fund supporting the restructuring of domestic debt in a manner that safeguards the interests of bank depositors in Sri Lanka. I want to assure everyone that the restructuring of domestic debt will not result in any loss or impact to the depositors. Additionally, the interest rates offered by banks will remain unaffected. Banks are committed to paying the applicable interest on fixed deposits for the entire duration. If fixed deposits were to be affected, we would undoubtedly witness widespread protests on the streets. However, such a situation is not permissible. A significant number of bonds were issued to cover pension and provident funds, and the government has received the necessary funds while providing subsidized interest rates. I want to emphasize that there will be no reduction in treasury bonds. Instead, alternative solutions such as interest rate reductions and debt deferment are being employed. These measures ensure the security of employees funds in EPFETF and other similar funds. Moreover, the government has guaranteed an interest rate of 12 for these funds until 2025, followed by a guaranteed interest rate of 9 until the maturity date. It is true that some may argue that the expected interest income might not be attained. However, the current trend indicates a significant decrease in market interest rates. We hope that the market interest rates align with the government-guaranteed rates for employee funds. Considering the decrease in inflation, the interest income provided by the government for employee funds is quite substantial. It is important to note that this interest income issue pertains only to contributory funds, and the reduced amount for other funds will be addressed by the relevant institutions. Therefore, employees will not suffer any loss. It is indeed a positive outcome to receive substantial interest on the right amount of money through domestic credit optimization, rather than losing all the funds. Once this economic crisis is resolved, the country will witness the creation of new job opportunities and a decrease in inflation. This program will bring numerous economic benefits to our nation. We will have easy access to essential goods and medicines, new businesses will emerge, and the gross domestic product will increase. Achieving this situation requires some sacrifices. Without them, we cannot prevent the country from falling into an economic crisis once again. The banking association and local banks have agreed to support the Presidents program, which includes a planned reduction in bank interest rates. We can expect to see this rate cut within the next two months. Lower interest rates will enable small and medium-sized businesses, export-oriented enterprises, and major business ventures to flourish. Banks are fully prepared to provide the necessary support for this endeavour. I firmly believe that with the support of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka and the unity of banks, we will be able to overcome this financial crisis. As bankers, we possess the ability to contribute to President Ranil Wickremesinghes vision of nation-building. We hold significant power to make a difference. Moving forward, we will be able to offer loans to our customers at lower interest rates, supporting their various financial needs.",

        "date": "July 7, 2023 10:16 am",
        "content": "Sri Lankan cricketer Danushka Gunathilaka, who allegedly raped a woman inside her home in Sydneys eastern suburbs has revealed plans to avoid having his case decided by a jury. He pleaded not guilty to a single charge of sexual intercourse without consent last month after three further rape charges were withdrawn by NSW Police in court. The cricketer was in Sydney for the T20 World Cup when he allegedly matched with a woman on a dating app, with the pair chatting a number of times before meeting on November 2. Police allege that after agreeing to meet the pair had drinks in the Sydney CBD before they went back to the womans house in Sydneys eastern suburbs about 11pm that evening. Mr Gunathilaka is alleged by police to have ignored the womans request to take it slow once at the property, and instead sexually assaulted the 29-year-old woman in her own home. The cricketer is alleged to have choked the woman at least three times  with the womans breathing allegedly restricted for six seconds  and engaged in forceful intercourse. The woman told police she was too afraid to do anything and had only consented to sexual intercourse if he agreed to wear a condom, which police claim she later found on the floor. The court was told in June the remaining sexual assault charge related to stealthing, the non-consensual removal of a condom during sex which was criminalised in June 2022. Appearing before Downing Centre District Court on Friday, lawyer Sara Black applied for the cricketers arraignment to be adjourned as they prepared a further application for a judge-alone trial. The situation is there is an application for a judge-alone trial which will be filed in court, Ms Black said. The Crown is not in a position to consent to the application at this time. The court was told the Crown prosecutor would likely fight the application and that Mr Gunathilaka intended to make written submissions to the court prior to the hearing. Most trials in the NSW District Court and the Supreme Court are heard before a judge and jury. However, in certain circumstances, an order may be made for a judge-alone trial. If the accused applies for a judge alone trial but the prosecutor does not agree, it will be for a judge to determine whether it is in the interests of justice to make the order. The judge will have to consider a range of factors in determining whether a judge-alone trial is appropriate, including the role of a jury, potential prejudices, and complexity of the evidence. Mr Gunathilaka has been in Australia since he was arrested over the charges late-last year, and will be required to remain in the country as he prepares to fight the charges in court. The Sri Lankan national previously surrendered his passport to police following the charges, and is required to report to police once a day as part of his bail conditions. The court was previously told Mr Gunathilaka does not have a criminal record, and had paid an 200,000 surety to the court to ensure his attendance at proceedings. He will reappear before the same court on July 19, when the judge-alone trial application will be heard. --Agencies",

In a Twitter thread, State Minister of Finance Shehan Semasinghe noted that the execution of Aswesuma would not, however, undergo any changes. According to the lawmaker, the Welfare Benefits Board has received a total of 760,000 appeals and 10,000 objections. These appeals and objections will be evaluated at the earliest possible to provide assistance to those who are most in need and ensure equitable distribution of resources, he added. The Aswesuma welfare benefits program, initiated as part of the social safety net to alleviate the ongoing economic crisis, is carried out under the purview of State Minister Semasinghe, with the involvement of various government agencies, including the Ministry of Finance. Through this program, financial assistance will be provided to the lower-income group, comprising 40 of society, across four categories  transitional, vulnerable, poor and extremely poor.

Addressing a press conference themed Collective Path to a Stable Country on Thursday (July 06), the lawmaker said the security of the Indian Ocean is a concern for both India and Sri Lanka. The Navy contributes significantly to the security of the Indian Ocean region and does so with great responsibility. Tennakoon said the Sri Lankan government obtains an annual report on national security for the following five years. This assessment covers crimes related to geopolitics, terrorism, extremism, and illicit activity. In accordance with this evaluation, steps are taken regarding the security of the country as a state. When making decisions, these evaluations are taken into consideration. Speaking further, the lawmaker mentioned that relief measures have been implemented for more than 2,200 people who have been affected by the adverse weather and necessary amendments will be brought to prevent misuse of existing circulars in providing disaster relief. As the government has observed that necessary amendments should be made to prevent misuse of existing circulars in providing disaster relief, the state minister said these amendments need to be changed as soon as feasible. According to him, the government has invested Rs. 60 billion between 2016 and 2021 to help those impacted by calamities.",

        "date": "July 7, 2023 12:35 pm",
        "content": "Sri Lankas proposed government debt restructuring plan should reduce funding and liquidity risk for non-bank financial institutions (NBFIs), says Fitch Ratings. The plan avoids direct impact on the local-currency government debt holdings of NBFIs and commercial banks, easing uncertainty over the entities capital, funding and liquidity profiles. Nonetheless, the proposal is only one aspect of the sovereigns debt sustainability plan, and the weak economic environment continues to pose downside risk to the sector. The government debt holdings of Sri Lankan NBFIs mainly comprise local-currency treasury securities to meet regulatory liquid-asset requirements and for investment returns. Finance and leasing companies (FLCs) have boosted government debt securities holdings amid a weak economic outlook, lacklustre lending opportunities and a preference for stronger liquidity buffers at a time of extreme market uncertainty. Such holdings are not excessive, at around 8 of sector assets at end-March 2023 (end-March 2020: 5), but any direct impact from a government restructuring plan would have added to asset quality and earnings pressure arising from Sri Lankas difficult economic backdrop. These securities also comprise a larger proportion of banking-sector assets, and any losses arising from a restructuring could have further constrained banks capacity and willingness to provide funding to the NBFI sector. Foreign-currency denominated Sri Lanka Development Bonds will be subject to restructuring, but Fitch-rated NBFIs have no exposure to these instruments. We also do not expect the latest proposal to prompt a loss of depositor confidence in the banking system that would raise contagion risk for NBFIs deposits and bank funding lines. For more analysis on the implications for the banking sector, see Sri Lankas Domestic Debt Plan a Significant Step for Resolving Bank Uncertainty. Fitch views the funding and liquidity profiles of Sri Lankan NBFIs as closely linked to that of banks, given the NBFIs dependence on banks as a funding source. FLCs sourced approximately 73 of total non-deposit funding from other financial institutions as at end-March 2023, of which the bulk would be from banks. Similarly, banks are major funding providers for other NBFI sub-sectors, such as securities firms. FLCs credit drivers are also linked to those of banks due to their bank-like business models, common prudential regulator and predominant domestic exposure. Sri Lankan NBFIs continue to face significant downside risks beyond those addressed in the recent proposal. The economy contracted by 11.5 in 1Q23, pressuring the FLC sectors already-high non-performing loan ratio of 16 as at end-March 2023, while higher funding costs have crimped net interest margins and profitability. Fitch Ratings says it expects economic conditions to remain difficult, particularly for FLCs largely sub-prime customer base, despite a modest improvement in inflation, interest rate and exchange rate trends in recent weeks. Capital markets are likely to stay volatile despite recent positive moves, keeping the financial prospects of securities firms less predictable in the near term. Any resistance from other government debt holders could also hold back the proposal and raise fresh doubts for the domestic financial system. The debt announcement and subsequent sovereign rating action do not directly impact Fitchs national ratings on Sri Lankan NBFIs. The ratings remain on Rating Watch Negative (RWN) due to ongoing operating environment risks, which could weaken NBFIs credit profiles relative to other entities on the national ratings scale. Fitch Ratings says it would look to resolve the RWNs upon greater stability in the domestic economy and financial markets, and better visibility on how the economic downturn will affect NBFIs franchises and financial profiles. This could require more clarity on the final outcome of the debt restructuring, including on foreign-currency debt, and the impact on the banking and corporate sectors.",

        "title": "Agreements with fuel suppliers further amended",
        "date": "July 7, 2023 01:23 pm",
        "content": "Two amendments have been made to the agreements signed between Sri Lanka and its new fuel suppliers. Accordingly, it has been decided that the conversion of Sri Lankan Rupees (LKR) to US Dollars (USD) must take place immediately with regard to money earned from fuel sales, while the recent tax of Rs. 50 imposed per litre of fuel will replace the 1 royalty fee imposed on suppliers, Minister of Power and Energy Kanchana Wijesekera said in Parliament. Speaking with regards to the first amendment, the Minister explained that albeit the initial condition mandating that funds being brought into Sri Lanka be maintained as LKR in an account for a period of nine months, after which it may be converted to USD, the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) recently suggested that the money being recovered from fuel sales, in LKR, be immediately converted to USD and be kept in an account for a period of one year. It is only the conversion of Rupees into Dollars that will be allowed immediately, but the repatriation of funds will still remain for 12 months. So, the repatriation of profits are allowed, repatriation of funds will remain in Sri Lanka, as per the original condition, for 12 months. Because there will be significant amount of pressure on the foreign reserves if we try to convert bulk amounts after a nine-month period, and that might lead into variations in the exchange right, Wijesekera explained. Meanwhile, explaining the second amendment made to the agreements, the Minister stated that while it was initially suggested to impose a royalty of 1 on the three existing fuel suppliers and other future suppliers, this was later withdrawn following the imposition of a Rs. 50 tax by the Ministry of Finance, prior to the implementation of the former. Explaining the matter further, Wijesekera stated that the decision to remove the royalty fee was taken in a bid to prevent double-taxing the consumers. Since a Rs. 50 tax has already been introduced after this scheme had come into play, thatll be a double tax on the suppliers, and that will be passed on to the consumer again. So, since an already implemented tax is in place, the 1 royalty has been taken out, he said in this regard. The Minister assured, however, that the Rs. 50 collected from suppliers will be used to recover the payments made for the Indian Line of Credit (LoC), and the funds obtained from Iran in 2000.",

        "date": "July 7, 2023 01:28 pm",
        "content": "India plans to allow Sri Lanka up to 12 years to repay its debt to help ease the financial burden on the island nation, Indias Export Credit Guarantee Corporation (ECGC) Ltds chairman-cum-managing director M. Senthilnathan said. Sri Lanka, facing its worst economic and political crisis in over seven decades, owes 7.1 billion to bilateral creditors 3 billion owed to China, 2.4 billion to the Paris Club and 1.6 billion to India. Sri Lankas negotiations with the IMF are going on. After that restructuring package will come, we will recover our money over a period of time. What we are supposed to get in 3-4 years, may get extended to 10-12 years, Senthilnathan said. But the interest rate will come down. This is a situation induced by inflation and because of the fallout of (Ukraine) war. You accommodate them for the next 5-6 years and later the markets will open up, Senthilnathan added. Earlier this year, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) approved a 3 billion loan programme for Sri Lanka to help stabilize its economy and begin restructuring its debt. The island nation received an immediate disbursement of about 333 million under the 48-month programme approved by the IMF. Senthilnathan added that the National Export Insurance Account, managed by the ECGC, has received close to 4,500 crore worth of claims from exporters facing default in countries such as Sri Lanka, Zambia, Suriname and Ghana which faced extreme economic hardships after covid-19 and the Ukraine war. Notably, Sri Lankas financial situation is improving as it has lifted import restrictions on 286 items. Originally, its government had limited imports of more than 3,200 items, including seafood, electronics and even musical instruments. Besides, its reserves have grown 26 to a 17-month high of 3.5 billion in May, helped by stronger remittances and tourism earnings. India had earlier extended a 1 billion credit line for Sri Lanka by a year. The credit line, part of a 4 billion emergency assistance extended by India during the peak of Sri Lankas financial crisis early last year, was scheduled to end in March. Source: Live Mint",

        "date": "July 7, 2023 04:15 pm",
        "content": "Twitter has threatened legal action against Meta over its new text-based app called Threads, which has drawn tens of millions of users since launching this week as a rival to Elon Musks social media platform. In a letter Wednesday to Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Alex Spiro, an attorney representing Twitter, accused Meta of unlawfully using Twitters trade secrets and other intellectual property by hiring former Twitter employees to create a copycat app. The move ramps up the tensions between the social media giants after Threads debuted Wednesday, targeting those who are seeking out alternatives to Twitter amid unpopular changes Musk has made to the platform since buying it last year for 44 billion. Meta spokesperson Andy Stone wrote Thursday on Threads: No one on the Threads engineering team is a former Twitter employee  thats just not a thing. In the letter, which news website Semafor first reported Thursday, Spiro said Twitter intends to strictly enforce its intellectual property rights and noted the companys right to seek civil remedies or a court injunction. He said the letter marked a formal notice for Meta to preserve documents relevant for a potential dispute between the companies. In a reply to a tweet about the possibility of legal action against Meta, Musk wrote: Competition is fine, cheating is not. The Associated Press reached out to Spiro on Thursday for further information. Twitter responded to an email seeking comment with a crude automated reply, its standard response to journalists. New Twitter CEO Linda Yaccarino has not publicly commented on the letter but appeared to address Threads launch. Were often imitated  but the Twitter community can never be duplicated, Yaccarino tweeted. Some analysts say Metas new offering, billed as a text-based version of the photo-sharing app Instagram, could be a significant headache for Twitter  pointing to the excitement surrounding Threads launch and impressive download numbers so far. But success isnt guaranteed. Industry watchers point to Metas track record of starting standalone apps that were later shut down and note that Threads is still in its early days. Besides some glitches and gripes about missing features, Metas new app also has raised data privacy concerns. While Threads launched in more than 100 countries, it is notably unavailable in the European Union, which has strict data privacy rules. Source: Associated Press -Agencies",

        "date": "July 7, 2023 10:30 pm",
        "content": "A recent report by the Economic Times has revealed that Bharat Jain, who can be seen roaming around and begging in Indias financial capital Mumbai, is probably the wealthiest beggar globally, after he turned the profession of begging into lucrative business. In Indias large begging fraternity, Jain has emerged as the real family man, by earning enormous wealth while raising his family which includes his father, brother, wife and two sons,. How much wealth has Bharat Jain amassed? According to the report, Bharat Jain has accumulated a net worth of 900k (Rs 7.5 crore) despite his sluggish beginnings. His monthly income varies from Rs 60,000 to 75,000. The man has been relentlessly begging at prime locations in Mumbai, including Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus railway station (CSMT) and Azad Maidan. Notably, Jain also owns an INR 1.2 crore flat in Mumbai and owns two shops in Thane which earn him more than Rs 30,000 in monthly rent. Children studied in convent school Jain and his family reside in a 1BHK duplex apartment situated in Parel area of Mumbai. Although his children received their education from a convent school, Jain himself faced financial instability that prevented him from pursuing formal education. Despite being the worlds richest beggar, he has not let himself detach from his roots as he continues to beg to date. While regular workers struggle to earn a few hundred rupees working tirelessly throughout the day, Bharat Jain earns more than Rs 2000 in his 10 to 12-hour long shift. While other members of his family run a stationery store, they consistently advise Jain to refrain from begging. Despite their advice, Jain continues with his occupation of begging.",

        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe has expressed his belief that Sri Lanka tourism industry would significantly contribute to the countrys foreign exchange earnings in the coming decade. Speaking at the Transcending Borders  Transforming Lives program organized by the Indian Tourism Federation at the Bandaranaike International Memorial Conference Hall (BMICH) in Colombo on Thursday (06 July), the President highlighted that comprehensive plans have already been formulated to enhance Sri Lankas appeal as a tourist destination and stressed that promoting tourism could lead to an increase in per capita income. President Wickremesinghe also emphasized the importance of collaborative efforts among all the BIMSTEC countries to develop the BIMSTEC region into a thriving tourism hub, transcending national borders. Addressing the event, Indian High Commissioner to Sri Lanka Gopal Baglay announced the expansion of flights between Chennai and Jaffna, which now operates only four times a week, to begin daily operations basis starting from 16 July. He further mentioned ongoing efforts to resume the long-discontinued ferry service between the two nations, which had remained inactive for several decades. Following is the speech delivered by President Ranil Wickremesinghe; Well assure you that Sri Lankas tourism, the new plans that our Minister Harin is going to implement, will certainly make it a good stay, a wonderful stay, an incredible stay. Now many of you, some of you, will, after this conference, be visiting different parts of Sri Lanka. I would like to tell you there are things that you should not miss. Go to Trincomalee and see the Dakshinakailash. Come to Kataragama and see the shrine of Lord Vellamurugan. Its over 2000 years old, one of the oldest standing Hindu shrines in the region. I was there for the festival a few days ago, and there were over 200,000 people there. Or visit Nallur in Jaffna to see the festival thats starting there. This is a part of our culture, and its worth a trip to see some of these, just as much as youve gone and seen the hill country and others. High Commissioner Gopal, yes, youve seen Ella, but Ive got to show you something else. The impact of the Ukraine war in Sri Lanka, where a Russian Chef is running a Japanese restaurant in Weligama. Theres something more we are going to add, as I talk with the Minister, there will be a military tattoo in August together with the Nallur festival and the Kandy Perahera, not the normal arms but something like the Edinburgh tattoo which will be full of dance and music. And in January, we have the Galle Literary Festival. This time its going to be a gala one. Every town in Galle, in the southern province, will have its own festival. Hirikatiya will have a beach discotheque, and there will be modern jazz and modern art. In Matara, there will be a number of classical music events, and in addition to that, in January, you can also listen to Andrea Bocelli singing in Colombo. So thats what we are adding on. We are trying to make tourism new and make more use of the potential. When we faced bankruptcy in Sri Lanka, now that we are getting out of it and debt restructuring is taking place, we still have to remember that the balance of trade is not in our favour. So we have to ensure a positive balance of trade in time to come. And one of the means of raising funds which is not debt-creating, is tourism. So exploit it to the full. Use it, and we are looking at new tourism from the 2.5 million we have to go to 5 million to start with. Look at the upper end of the markets. Why not have 500 a night to 1,000 a night? We have got to learn from Maldives, the smallest of the South Asian countries. We are trying to put 7 more golf courses in, make Nuwara Eliya the centre of golf. We want to have large resorts. We have identified one next to Dedduwa, over 1000 acres with water, good for very environmentally friendly tourism. Another one is next to Horton Plains, another 900 acres which will be another forest reserve where you can have 5-star luxury accommodation. There are many other places where yachts and yachting will start, with Mannar as one of the headquarters, throughout the Jaffna Lagoon, down into Trincomalee and further down. We will exploit the railway in different ways, just like you have gone up to Ella. Moreover, we want to hand over a large number of plantation bungalows for boutique hotels. So there are going to be more and more items that we will add on to it. Food items, dance items, to make Sri Lanka truly known as a worthwhile tourist destination. We expect to attract many visitors from Asia, including India, East Asia, South Asia, and West Asia, because it is easier for them to travel. We will open up the Eastern Province, and there will be apartments available for purchase where you can directly stay near the beaches of the Eastern Province. Why not? If you want to have a villa, we will make arrangements for that too, for buying and holding. Why not? Come here, this is the place. The laws will be changed to accommodate our plans. So I thought this is the way we should proceed. And I was thinking to myself, why didnt we do it earlier? And I looked at what we are doing in the region. Of the three regions in Asia, of our size, East Asia, Southeast Asia has far more tourists than us. South Asia together may not have as many tourists as one or two of the East Asian or Southeast Asian countries or Western Europe. Why is it? India is good with domestic tourism. Are you going to rely solely on domestic tourism? When you can earn so much money and foreign exchange, more than what you target for, if you attract international travellers. In the next 10 years, per capita income will increase, people will travel around, and look for eco-friendly tourism. Why dont we have it? So why dont we make our whole BIMSTEC area one borderless tourist area? Is that what you want? Transcending borders? Not just Sri Lankans traveling to India or Indians traveling to Bangladesh. No. Its one tourist area for anyone who wants to come from outside. We have so much to offer. I have seen some of your assets. I have driven from Srinagar to Ladakh, to Leh. Staying in Kargil was not the best of accommodations, but the potential you have for development. I have been to many other areas of India as well. What is Biryani? You might think of it as just one dish, but I think of it in terms of 60-70 dishes. Each area has its own Biryani. And if you go to Batticaloa, you can have a 24-egg Biryani. Now, why dont we market it? All of us here. The Biryani is a dish. When you come here, there are so many dishes to try. Look at how Thais have marketed their food. A country of 70 million. Why cant we do the same? All you have done is market Chicken Tikka Masala, which is not even from India. Lets make Biryani the signature dish for our region. People who want to come and taste it will have enough Biryani restaurants around the world. Why dont we have Michelin-star chefs specializing in Biryani? Look at the potential we have. We are looking at a cruise, a ship that has come from India to Sri Lanka. Why dont we open up to BIMSTEC? Why dont we use the Bay of Bengal for cruises? We are bigger than the Caribbean. Look at the potential. If people from East Asia, India, Southeast Asia, West Asia, and Africa come together, why travel all that way? Look at how we can develop and showcase the places in Sri Lanka. Look at Mahabalipuram. See Odisha. These are the places Europeans and others must see. Look at Coxs Bazar. Explore the Andaman Islands. They are already popular among Indians. When this happens, prices in the Andaman Islands will go up. Look at Myanmar. They can travel down to the Andaman seas, all the way down to Singapore. If we start now and plan ahead, in 10 years time, we will have a completely new industry. Why dont we have travel arrangements? We can arrange it. You can go to Lumbini, and the next flight can bring you to Buddhagaya. See those places, and the next flight can bring you to Colombo, so you can visit the Temple of the Tooth and the Bo-tree. We need to arrange our connectivity in such a way. Why not climb up to the base camp and then come down to an island in the Maldives? These are the unique holidays that no one else can offer. We can think of so many other holiday options. Look at all the different dance forms we have. The various dancers in different regions. This is the potential we have to attract millions of tourists every year to our region. Why not utilize it? And this is my idea, that BIMSTEC should be one big tourist area. We can also showcase Biryani and other cuisines. Look at cricket. When we were small, everything was decided at the MCC. Today, cricket is identified with India. If we have achieved such a big success in cricket, why cant we come together and make tourism equally successful? Lets go upmarket and charge more. It means our rural people will have a better income. Lets all work towards it. Lets think about it. Maybe all of you here from the Sri Lankan industry and from India can learn something. Theres something we can learn from the Maldives, and we can talk to Nepal. Lets look at it and develop a thriving tourist industry. A place where millions of people visit our region, making it prosperous for the people in our countries. Addressing the gathering Indian High Commissioner to Sri Lanka Gopal Baglay said; I am inspired by the presence of the Honourable President, and if I may mention, it was on his visit last weekend that the diplomatic envoys embarked on an unforgettable train journey through some of the most beautiful parts of Sri Lanka, aboard a vintage train called the Viceroy Special. I mentioned this not just to reminisce about the beautiful journey through the misty forests, plantation areas, and picturesque landscapes of Sri Lanka, but because it reminded me of two things. One is the resemblance of the area to Vasuri and Nilgiris, which some of you might be familiar with, especially those who have come from India. The altitude is roughly the same as Visuri, but due to the tea plantations on both sides of the railway tracks, it gives the impression of passing through Nilgiri. However, this is not the reason I am mentioning it. When we reached our destination, a place called Ella, which is famous for, among other things, the world-renowned nine arches bridge, I couldnt believe my eyes. Just six months ago, when I visited, there were hundreds of tourists on either side of the railway track and all over the place. There were tourists from India, Sri Lanka, and other countries. For some of us on the train, it was a stark reminder of how different that moment was from about a year ago. Mr. President, your presence here is, to me, a vote of confidence in the present and the potential, as well as a reiteration of the partnership between the people of India and Sri Lanka for progress. It signifies a step towards even closer cooperation for the prosperity of both nations. The theme Transcending Borders, Transforming Lives, is precisely the spirit of the India-Sri Lanka relationship that has brought these two countries together as civilizational twins. We are all aware of the geographical proximity of India and Sri Lanka, but over the course of millennia, this proximity has been layered with history, culture, civilization, religions, languages, music, films, cricket, democracy, diversity, plurality, respect, peace, and harmony. When you visit Sri Lanka, it also reflects the values that we cherish and share, as demonstrated by Buddha and Mahatma Gandhi. I express my gratitude to the Minister of Tourism and the invaluable guidance and leadership of President Ranil Wickremesinghe. Over the past few months, we have not only resumed the Chennai-Jaffna flights, which used to operate four times a week, but these flights will now operate every day starting from July 16th. We are also working on resuming the ferry services, which have been inactive for decades, and the idea of an international cruise from India to Sri Lanka is no longer just a concept. The use of Indian currency in Sri Lanka is a boost to tourism, as Indian tourists can now conveniently use their currency for payments. Additionally, efforts are underway to enable digital payments between the two countries. This will not only facilitate transcending borders and transforming lives but also build upon the legacies that form our common heritage. The Sri Lanka Tourism Promotion Bureau extended an invitation to host the Conference of Travel Agents of India 2023 in Colombo, from the 6th to the 9th of July. This prestigious event is particularly noteworthy as it marks the 67th time that the Indian Tourism Federation, in collaboration with the Sri Lanka Domestic Tour Operators Association, organizing the conference and exhibition. The Travel Agents Association of India (TAAI) has appointed its members as tourism ambassadors, and their involvement in previous summits has consistently led to a significant four-fold increase in tourist arrivals to the host destinations. In light of this success, the conference features a two-day business session and buyer-seller meetings, at the Cinnamon Grand and Shangri-La hotels. With a strong turnout, 500 members of the Indian Tourism Federation participating in this highly anticipated event. The promotion of Sri Lankas tourism industry has been a focal point of discussions throughout the conference. Additionally, 50 Indian journalists have joined the gathering to cover the proceedings, highlighting the significance of this occasion. In conjunction with the conference, the Sri Lanka Inland Tourism Operators Association (SLAITO) and its member associations have meticulously organized a post-summit tour encompassing popular tourist destinations such as Bentota, Galle, and Kandy. This initiative aims to showcase the beauty and diversity of Sri Lankas attractions to the attendees. The Travel Agents Association of India (TAAI) Colombo Summit has garnered support from four major airlines, namely SriLankan Airlines, Air India, IndiGo, and Vistara. These partnerships will facilitate seamless travel arrangements for the participants and further enhance the success of the summit. Dignitaries and key figures attending the event included Nimal Siripala de Silva, Minister of Ports and Maritime Affairs, Harin Fernando, Minister of Tourism and Lands, and Ms Jyoti Mayal, President of the Indian Travel Agents Association, among others.",

        "date": "July 8, 2023 09:17 am",
        "content": "The Dutch government is returning 478 objects looted during colonial times to Indonesia and Sri Lanka. Following multiple claims from Indonesia, Sri Lanka and Nigeria, the Dutch Secretary of State for Culture and Media Gunay Uslu announced the decision Thursday to repatriate objects including the Lombok treasure, consisting of 335 objects from Lombok, Indonesia, the Pita Maha collection, a key collection of modern art from Bali and the 18th-century Cannon of Kandy, a ceremonial weapon from Sri Lanka made of bronze, silver and gold and inlaid with rubies. This is a historic moment, Uslu said in a press statement. Its the first time were following recommendations to give back objects that should never have been brought to the Netherlands. But more than anything, its a moment to look to the future. Were not only returning objects; were also embarking on a period of closer cooperation with Indonesia and Sri Lanka in areas like collection research, presentation and exchanges between museums. In 2020, a Dutch Council for Culture report produced by a committee chaired by human rights lawyer Lilian Gonçalves-Ho Kang You recommended that the country should unconditionally return objects it was reasonably sure were lost involuntarily by countries under its colonial authority. Many of the objects to be returned are in the National Museum of World Cultures. Six other colonial artifacts claimed by Sri Lanka are currently in the collection of the Rijksmuseum, the Netherlands national museum of arts and history; this is the first repatriation of such artifacts from the museum following provenance research that began in 2017. The Cannon of Kandy, for instance, was looted by troops from the Dutch East India Company during the 1765 siege and plunder of Kandy, and it was later gifted to William V, Prince of Orange. Valika Smeulders, head of the Rijksmuseums department of history, told The Art Newspaper there has been a clear shift in perspective. I think the way that the museum world used to look at this debate in the 20th century was very much about the concern to preserve objects for generations to come, and obviously museums in Europe have the facilities to do that, she said. But what changed is our viewpoint: these objects are to tell the stories of our countries, of our shared history of peoples. So what we see now as our mission is to have the objects in the places where they are best able to tell the stories that are important. She dismissed concerns that the new policy would mean European museums losing collection highlights  which until recently played a role in considering restitution claims on Nazi-looted art in the Netherlands. I dont really think that is going to happen, because I expect countries of provenance and museums here in Europe will have a discussion about which objects will go back, and not all of them will be, Smeulders said. But what we will gain, all of us, is more knowledge about these objects, how they came into our possession, their background, what stories are we able to tell. So in the end well have an enrichment of what we do instead of empty galleries. The collection of objects repatriated to Indonesia will not include human remains of the Java man, which are displayed at the Naturalis Biodiversity Center in Leiden as some of the earliest specimens of the extinct early human, Homo erectus. A spokesperson for the Dutch government told The Guardian Thursday that no decision regarding the Java man remains had been reached. Nothing has been declined, but some things take longer than others, the spokesperson said. Gert-Jan van den Bergh, a specialist in art law at the law firm Bergh Stoop  Sanders, told The Art Newspaper that the repatriation effort was an important first step, but just a first step. Dont forget, we have 300,000 colonial objects that are the property of the central state in the Netherlands alone, Van den Bergh said, adding that there should be more scrutiny of privately-owned colonial objects as well, including at major auction houses. A ceremonial handover of objects to the National Museum of Indonesia in Jakarta will take place at the Museum Volkenkunde Leiden on July 10. Source: CNN -Agencies",

        "date": "July 8, 2023 10:31 am",
        "content": "Debt-ridden Sri Lanka may need to cut interest rates again to further boost growth in its economy, according to the head of its central bank. Dr. Nandalal Weerasinghe, governor of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka, told CNBC Friday that there will be more rate cuts to come, even after the central bank lowered its policy rate for a second consecutive month from 12 to 11 on Thursday. Asked if additional rate cuts will be needed, the governor answered: Of course. He pointed to falling inflation rates in the Sri Lankan economy. We should need further reduction in interest rates on the basis of forward-looking inflation, forward-looking output gap. This shows we made the right decision, Weerasinghe told CNBCs Squawk Box Asia. Sri Lanka negotiated a nearly 3 billion bailout from the International Monetary Fund last year, after thousands of protesters drove out the president from power, raiding his official residence and office on outrage over the governments economic mismanagement. Stocks listed in its capital Colombo jumped earlier in the week after parliament approved a domestic debt restructuring plan last weekend. Colombos CSE All Share Index jumped by about 8 this week after parliament passed the plan required for the IMFs bailout package. Sri Lankas total debt has exceeded 83 billion, the Associated Press reported, including foreign debt of 41.5 billion and 42.1 billion of domestic debt. Prices in Sri Lanka rose 12 in June, the latest government data showed  a steep decline from the recent peak inflation rate of nearly 70 seen in September last year. The central bank governor was optimistic about the economys path forward. He predicted inflation could fall to single-digit figures and the economy could turn from contraction to growth by next year. If you look at the future, forward-looking inflation, we see very clearly, end-of-July inflation will be 7 by single digit and by end of the year, inflation will be low single-digit, he said. Weerasinghe said further policy support from the central bank could help economic revival in the nation. We hope that rate cuts can be some sort of support for the recovery for the second half of the year. And obviously for the next full year, we expect the country to bounce back to positive territory, he said. The Sri Lankan economy contracted by 11.5 year-on-year in the first quarter of 2023, gross domestic product figures released last month showed. The economys GDP has stayed in negative territory since the first quarter of 2022. Source: CNBC -Agencies",

        "content": "Despite certain media reports claiming that the service of former Inspector General of Police (IGP) C. D. Wickramaratne has been extended by a further three months, no official announcement has been made in this regard, police sources confirmed. Accordingly, the former IGP is yet to receive an official notice in this regard, in writing, police surces said. Former IGP C. D. Wickramaratnes tenure ended on 26 March, after which he received a three-month extension by way of a special gazette notification issued by Presidents Secretary Saman Ekanayake. Thus, the position of IGP has been left vacant since the end of Wickramaratnes tenure on 26 June. Meanwhile, speaking in Parliament yesterday (07 July), Prime Minister Dinesh Gunawardena assured that a decision pertaining to the appointment of a new IGP will be made very soon, possibly within the following 48 hours.

        "date": "July 8, 2023 03:57 pm",
        "content": "The Committee on Public Accounts (COPA) has slammed the officials of Department of National Zoological Gardens for spending outrageously high amounts of money to purchase certain species of birds. During its meeting on Wednesday, the COPA revealed that the Zoological Gardens Department, between 2018 and 2020, had purchased some species of birds for approximately Rs. 1.5 million despite the estimated amount being Rs. 50,000. The difference between the estimated amount and the purchased amount was thus disclosed as 3,000, which the COPA deemed problematic. In this procurement, due to the condition that the supplier should provide 32 types of birds, the COPA said it drew its attention to the loss of nearly Rs. 17 million as the birds had to be purchased at exorbitant rates. During the meeting, presided over by COPA chairman MP Lasantha Alagiyawanna, the Auditor Generals report and current performance of the Zoological Gardens Department was examined comprehensively. The committee has questioned at length as to why there was such a drastic difference between the estimated cost and the actual cost of the purchase. Thereby, the COPA, emphasizing the need for an accurate assessment, went on to call for a report on the matter and an internal circular in a bid to prevent such future occurrences.",

        "date": "July 8, 2023 07:20 pm",
        "content": "Their Majesties the King and Queen of Thailand have bestowed an honour upon Don Upul Jayarathna Denelpitiyage, a Sri Lankan mahout, in recognition of his unyielding care for the recuperating Thai elephant, Sak Surin (also known as Muthu Raja), foreign media reported. The elephant is currently in 30-day quarantine in Lampang province of Thailand, following his flight from Sri Lanka on 02 July. Thai Air Marshal Pakdee Saengchuto, serving as the Kings deputy private secretary, represented the royals on Thursday as he presented a gift to Denelpitiyage, who originally hails from Dehiwala Zoo in Sri Lanka. The Thai Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment announced this via its Facebook page yesterday. The ceremonial presentation was carried out at the premises of the ministry, with its Permanent Secretary Jatuporn Buruspat and Denelpitiyage in attendance. Denelpitiyage was part of the official Thai delegation that journeyed from Sri Lanka to Thailand, where the task of caring for Sak Surin was taken up by the Thai Elephant Conservation Centre. Denelpitiyage made his return to Sri Lanka yesterday. The Thai Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment had invested approximately 19 million baht in taking care of the 30-year-old Sak Surin and in ensuring his medical repatriation to Thailand. Sak Surin is one of the three elephants that Thailand dispatched to Sri Lanka in a bid to bolster diplomatic ties, following an official request from Sri Lanka for the Thai government to send elephants to participate in special religious ceremonies featuring the Lord Buddhas relics. A noted update on Friday from the Thai ambassador to Sri Lanka clarified the circumstances of Pratu Pha, another elephant, presently residing on the island nation. The 49-year-old male elephant is said to be living under normal conditions with no plans in place for his repatriation back to Thailand. Poj Harnpol, the ambassador, endorsed this news with his recent visit to Pratu Pha at the Temple of the Tooth Relic in Kandy City, where the elephant is being nurtured under the watchful care of Pradeep Nilanga Dela Nilame, the temple custodian. Pratu Pha dwells in an open courtyard with a surface of concrete and soil. His range of movement is limited by ropes that demarcate boundaries. His front legs are tethered to large trees while one of his hind legs is lightly chained, allowing him to move and stand naturally. The animal enjoys a diet of the leaves from kithul trees, grass and sugar cane. Upon observation for 30 minutes, the ambassador took note of Pratu Phas calm demeanour and the mahouts ability to feed him from a distance. Harnpol expressed the necessity of an environment upgrade for the elephant, more access to water sources coupled with the addition of more water tanks. Albeit the elephants living conditions were satisfactory, Harnpol noted room for improvement. We understand the strides undertaken by the temple and are cognisant of the fact that change cannot occur overnight. We plan to work in the direction of better care. In an interview with Sri Lankan media, Harnpol confirmed that there were no forthcoming plans to repatriate Pratu Pha, widely known as Thai Raja, to Thailand. Thai Raja was gifted to Sri Lanka 37 years prior while Sak Surin and Sri Narong, another male elephant, were presented as goodwill gifts 22 years ago, reported Bangkok Post. -Agencies",

        "content": "The time period given to former President Maithripala Sirisena and other accused to pay compensation to the victims of the 2019 Easter Sunday terror attacks expires on July 12. On January 12 this year, the Supreme Court found that former President Sirisena, former Defence Secretary Hemasiri Fernando, former IGP Pujith Jayasundara, former National Intelligence Chief Sisira Mendis and former Chief of State Intelligence Service (SIS) Nilantha Jayawardena have violated the fundamental rights of the people by failing to take action to prevent the Easter Sunday bombings despite receiving sufficient intelligence information. The order was delivered by a seven-member Supreme Court Judge bench, with regard to 12 petitions filed by various parties stating that their fundamental rights were violated by negligence and failure to prevent the coordinated terrorist attacks on April 21, 2019. The 12 petitions were filed by a group of individuals including Nandana Sirimanna, whose two children were killed in the Easter Sunday attacks, tourism entrepreneur Janath Vidanage, three Catholic Fathers including Rev. Fr. Sarath Iddamalgoda, Attorney-at-Law Moditha Ekanayake, who was injured in the bombings at the Shangri-La Hotel. In its verdict, the Supreme Court bench had ordered Sirisena to pay Rs. 100 million in compensation to the petitioners, while Pujith Jayasundara and Nilantha Jayawardena were each ordered to pay Rs. 75 million, Hemasiri Fernando was ordered to pay Rs. 50 million and Sisira Mendis was ordered to pay Rs. 10 million from their personal money. However, according to reports, none of the accused has credited the amount to the bank account specifically set up for this purpose. In the event they fail to comply with the Supreme Courts order and to deposit the money before the deadline, it would be deemed a contempt of court.",

        "title": "Spotlight on potential BRICS currency as pushback against US dollar grows",
        "date": "July 8, 2023 10:21 pm",
        "content": "The de-dollarisation, the movement to reduce other countries reliance on the greenback, among the emerging economies of the BRICS economic group is yet to reach a common currency breakthrough. The de-dollarisation movement, however, is currently morphing into a growing number of countries ditching the dollar and choosing to trade in their own currencies instead. But despite an official clarification, the Russian embassy in Kenya said in a tweet, The BRICS countries are planning to introduce a new trading currency, which will be backed by gold. Earlier this week, however, the New Development Bank, a financial institution created by the BRICS bloc, said in an official statement that it doesnt have any immediate plans for a common currency. Instead, the members of BRICS  Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa  are pushing to conduct more bilateral trade in local currencies. They arent ready to challenge the global dominance of the dollar. The development of anything alternative is more a medium to long-term ambition, Leslie Maasdorp, Vice-President and Chief Financial Officer of the New Development Bank, told Bloomberg. There is no suggestion right now to create a BRICS currency. Prior to the BRICS virtual summit, Indias foreign minister Dr S Jaishankar said that there is no idea of a BRICS currency. Currencies will remain a national issue for a long time to come, Jaishankar added. The bloc, which was formed in 2009, has been striving to gain more clout globally as a way of counterbalancing the dominance the US and its traditional allies have in multilateral financial institutions such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. Still, even the Chinese Renminbi is a very long way from becoming a reserve currency, Maasdorp said. BRICS Banks focus on expanding its financial clout According to reports, a key part of the Shanghai-based New Development Bank is to expand its financial clout with a focus on 50 billion in subscribed capital. The intention has always been to create a global bank anchored in emerging markets, Maasdorp said. He further said that the bank aims to direct 40 per cent of lending to climate-related projects. New BRICS members A total of 19 countries, with 13 formal requests and approximately 5 or 6 informal queries, have approached BRICS leaders for becoming full members of the BRICS forum. In an interview with WION, South Africas foreign minister Naledi Pandor, disclosed that a number of countries, including Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, Algeria, Argentina, Mexico, and Nigeria, have expressed keen interest in joining BRICS. The recent BRICS Foreign Ministers meeting in Cape Town saw several African countries, Iran, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE attend the Friends of BRICS gathering. The upcoming BRICS summit in South Africa is expected to see multiple inclusions, possibly of Saudi Arabia and Iran, into a crucial multilateral grouping, significantly elevating its economic heft and simultaneous geopolitical clout. Brazils Lula chief supporter of common BRICS currency Brazils President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has vocally challenged the supremacy of the US dollar in recent months. Recently, in a show of support from a fellow BRICS partner, Brazils President Lula, while standing alongside his South African counterpart Cyril Ramaphosa, challenged the US dollars role as the worlds primary reserve currency for global trade. Ramaphosa, while seconding Lulas comment, said that the issue of currency would be discussed at the upcoming meeting of BRICS countries later this year, which South Africa is scheduled to host in August. Russias interest in a common BRICS currency Since the beginning of the war in Ukraine, Moscow has ramped up its efforts to promote de-dollarisation. Immediately after President Vladimir Putin announced special military operations against Ukraine, Washington froze half of Russias foreign currency reserves and banned its biggest banks from the SWIFT international payments system. Since February 2022, Russia has been pushing for de-dollarisation in consonance with China and nations deemed neutral in the wake of the ongoing Ukraine war. Alexander Babakov, the deputy chairman of Russian parliament, the State Duma, while speaking at the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum event in New Delhi, India, in April 203 had said that the plan is to initially transition to using domestic currencies in transactions. Following this, the introduction and circulation of a digital or an alternative form of currency could be explored. Brazil, Russia, India and China established BRIC in 2009 and the bloc became BRICS a year later when South Africa was admitted. If it expands to include other emerging nations with persistent surpluses, a globally fairer, multi-currency global system could emerge, ONeill said. The bloc represents about 26.7 per cent of the worlds land surface and 41.5 per cent of the global population. The BRICS countries hold a substantial 16 per cent share in world trade and over the years, they have played a vital role as engines of global economic growth. Source: WION -Agencies",

        "date": "July 9, 2023 10:05 am",
        "content": "Expressing his gratitude to trustworthy friend India for saving Sri Lanka and preventing a bloodbath during its unprecedented economic crisis last year, Parliament Speaker Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena has said that not a single nation has extended that kind of assistance to Colombo as done by New Delhi. Sri Lanka was hit by a catastrophic financial crisis in 2022, the worst since its independence from Britain in 1948, due to a severe paucity of foreign exchange reserves. As the country struggled, locked in the throes of the crisis, India extended multi-pronged assistance of about USD 4 billion to it last year, through multiple credit lines and currency support, in line with Indias Neighbourhood First policy. In his address at the gala dinner reception hosted for delegates of the Indian Travel Congress here on Friday, Abeywardena said India saved us during the financial crisis, otherwise, there would have been another bloodbath for all of us. At the evening reception, he thanked India for the help extended to the cash-strapped nation and recalled the civilisational ties and similarities between the two countries and their cultures. Sri Lanka and India are very, very closely interconnected countries, culturally, nationally, and policy-wise, and above all, India has been a very close associate and trustworthy friend of Sri Lanka, Abeywardena said, adding that when we were in trouble, India always helped out. And, even this time, today, I heard that India is willing to extend our restructuring of loans for 12 years. Never expected, and never in history, not a single country has extended that kind of assistance, he said. He recalled the helping hand lent by India during the period of trouble last year that devastated the Sri Lankan economy, pushing it into a debt crisis. I must tell you, during the trouble that we had last year, you (India) saved us, India saved us otherwise, there would have been another bloodbath for all of us. So, that is how India came to help us, Abeywardena said. He made the remarks in the presence of the Indian High Commissioner to Sri Lanka, Gopal Baglay, Sri Lankas Tourism and Lands Minister Harin Fernando, and other senior officials of the Sri Lankan government. Your ambassador here, (is a) very close friend of ours. We love and respect him, the Speaker said, referring to Baglay. Later, in an interaction with PTI on the sidelines of the reception, Abeywardena said, India has always come to aid of Sri Lanka in times of crises, and laid emphasis on the financial assistance given by New Delhi last year when the island nation was mired in the economic turmoil. That helped us survive for six months in the midst of the crisis, he said We thank India for the kind gesture, and I also say, thank you, honourable Prime Minister of India (Narendra Modi), he told PTI. Noting the similarity between the Indian surname Singh and the Sri Lankan surname Singhe, Abeywardena said, It shows we are genetically connected to India. That way, India is not a new country to us. Its part of the ethos of our country, part of our life, part of our heart, he said, adding, We are here to receive you, respect you, join with you. Together, we (Sri Lanka) can join with you (India), without any difficulty or hesitation, with great trust, the Speaker said. In his address, Tourism and Lands Minister Fernando pitched Sri Lanka -- Pearl of the Indian Ocean -- as a unique destination for India and the rest of the world, saying, One island nation offers so many different tourist experiences, without travelling far from one location to another. Meanwhile, several sessions were held on Saturday as part of the three-day 67th Convention of the TAAI (Travel Agents Association of India) which began here on July 6. The four-day convention of the TAAI which was established in 1951, is being held with the support of the Sri Lanka Tourism Promotion Bureau (SLTPB) and the Sri Lankan Association of Inbound Tour Operators (SLAITO).

        "date": "July 9, 2023 10:45 am",
        "content": "Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte visited the king Saturday to hand in the resignation of his four-party coalition, setting the deeply divided Netherlands on track for a general election later this year. King Willem-Alexander flew back from a family vacation in Greece to meet with Rutte, who drove to the palace in his Saab station wagon for the meeting to explain the political crisis that toppled his administration. Rutte declined to answer reporters questions as he drove away from the meeting that lasted over an hour, saying the talks with the monarch were private. The vexed issue of reining in migration that has troubled countries across Europe for years was the final stumbling block that brought down Ruttes government Friday night, exposing the deep ideological differences between the four parties that made up the uneasy coalition. Now it is likely to dominate campaigning for an election that is still months away. We are the party that can ensure a majority to significantly restrict the flow of asylum seekers, said Geert Wilders, leader of the anti-immigration Party for Freedom, who supported Ruttes first minority coalition 13 years ago, but also ultimately brought it down. Opposition parties on the left also want to make the election about tackling problems they accuse Rutte of failing to adequately address  from climate change to a chronic housing shortage and the future of the nations multibillion-euro (-dollar) agricultural sector. Socialist Party leader Lilian Marijnissen told Dutch broadcaster NOS the collapse of Ruttes government was good news for the Netherlands. I think that everybody felt that this Cabinet was done. They have created more problems than they solved. Despite the divisions between the four parties in Ruttes government, it will remain in power as a caretaker administration until a new coalition is formed, but will not pass major new laws. Given the challenges of the times, a war on this continent, nobody profits from a political crisis, tweeted Sigrid Kaag, leader of the centrist, pro-Europe D66 party. Rutte, the Netherlands longest-serving premier and a veteran consensus builder, appeared to be the one who was prepared to torpedo his fourth coalition government with tough demands in negotiations over how to reduce the number of migrants seeking asylum in his country. Rutte negotiated for months over a package of measures to reduce the flow of new migrants arriving in the country of nearly 18 million people. Proposals reportedly included creating two classes of asylum  a temporary one for people fleeing conflicts and a permanent one for people trying to escape persecution  and reducing the number of family members who are allowed to join asylum-seekers in the Netherlands. The idea of blocking family members was strongly opposed by minority coalition party ChristenUnie. I think unnecessary tension was introduced to the talks, said Kaag. Pieter Heerma, the leader of the Christian Democrats, a coalition partner, called Ruttes approach in the talks almost reckless. The fall of the government comes just months after a new, populist pro-farmer party, the Farmers Citizens Movement, known by its Dutch acronym BBB, shocked the political establishment by winning provincial elections. The party is already the largest bloc in the Dutch Senate and will be a serious threat to Ruttes Peoples Party for Freedom and Democracy. The BBBs leader, Caroline van der Plas, said her party would dust off their campaign posters from the provincial vote and go again. The campaign has begun! Van der Plas said in a tweet that showed her partys supporters hanging flags and banners from lamp posts. Source - The Associated Press -Agencies",

        "content": "The Secretary to the President Saman Ekanayake has requested to return the Coats of Arms with archaeological value that belonged to Sri Lankas former Governors and past Presidents, which were lost during the protests in the period between July 9 and July 14, 2022. He has requested that they be returned by July 31st 2023, the Presidents Media Division (PMD) reported. During the occupation of the Colombo Fort Presidential Palace by protesters from July 9th to July 14th, 2022, various valuable artifacts and archaeological items went missing, including coats of arms associated with former governors and presidents of Sri Lanka, the PMD mentioned. Ekanayake has emphasized that retaining possession of these official insignia beyond the specified period will result in legal consequences, as the unlawful possession of state property is a punishable offence. If anyone has information pertaining to these missing items, the Presidents Secretary kindly requests that the Presidential Secretariat be contacted via the telephone number 0112354354, adding that the publics assistance is crucial in locating these coats of arms of significant national importance and their assistance is deeply appreciated, according to the PMD.

        "date": "July 9, 2023 04:47 pm",
        "content": "Former Director General of the Bribery or Corruption Investigation Commission Sarath Jayamanna PC, announced during his appearance on the 101 Katha program produced by the Presidents Media Division (PMD), that the new anti-corruption act would establish a truly independent commission. He emphasized that any attempts to suppress this commission would be met with strong resistance from the people. Sarath Jayamanna further urged the public to encourage government leaders and officials to embrace this change and move away from empty slogans such as thieves were not caught, if we came to power we would catch thieves. He highlighted that bribery and corruption are not just issues faced by Sri Lanka but affect economies worldwide. He said leaders who genuinely care about their countrys development and its people are actively working to combat corruption, the PMD mentioned. In 2004, the global community united to develop a charter against bribery and corruption, acknowledging the detrimental impact of corruption on a nations economy. While Sri Lanka signed this charter, it has not been effectively implemented. Consequently, the perception persists that our government and private sectors are rife with bribery and corruption. To address this, we must study the experiences of countries that successfully tackled corruption. Asian nations like Singapore, Hong Kong, Bhutan, Indonesia, Malaysia, as well as Scandinavian countries, have made significant progress in eradicating bribery and corruption. These societies inherently reject such practices. As we lack this ingrained mind-set, we must adopt and nurture these values, beginning with a complete overhaul of the education sector. These are pivotal times in our countrys history, and the introduction of a new bill brings us pride. However, it is crucial to acknowledge that eliminating bribery and corruption overnight is unrealistic. Nevertheless, the existence of an anti-corruption act is a crucial step forward. The Bribery Act of 1954 was amended in 1994, leading to the establishment of the Bribery Corruption Commission. Unfortunately, for nearly 30 years, no substantial progress has been made. Despite our affiliation with the United Nations for two decades, an anti-corruption act has only now been proposed to combat bribery and corruption effectively. The commission has historically comprised police officers who have passed the General Certificate of Education. However, investigating complex crimes like bribery and corruption requires expertise beyond policing. Individuals knowledgeable in mathematics, engineering science, forensic auditing, and forensic accounting should be recruited to work in this field. Countries like Hong Kong and Bhutan do not rely on police officers for these investigations. Instead, they employ officials recruited in a manner similar to civil administrators. The new act grants the commission the authority to hire expert investigators. Their contracts may not be extended if their performance is unsatisfactory. Consequently, this act enables the hiring of skilled investigators without the need to navigate the Ministry of Finance or the Treasury for funding. Funding for the commission will be provided directly from the treasury through the Parliament, empowering it to address conflicts of interest, prevent bribery and corruption, and fulfil its obligations to the private sector. For the first time in history, the assets and liabilities of government executive officers will be electronically submitted to the Bribery Commission. Moreover, provisions have been established to investigate and penalize past offenses, ensuring a smooth transition from the old laws. It is generally challenging to apply laws retroactively. Therefore, the commissioners are selected by the Constituent Assembly. The Presidents discretionary appointment of the Director General is also subject to consultation with the Commission. In summary, the new anti-corruption act will establish an independent commission in the truest sense of the word. Any attempts to undermine its authority will face strong resistance from the people. It is the duty of the citizens to motivate government leaders and officials to embrace this change and move away from the previous empty slogans.",

Accordingly, IGP Wickramaratne has been granted a 03-month service extension from today as the police chief, subject to the approval of the Constitutional Council, according to the Presidents Media Division (PMD). A special meeting took place between the President and the Public Security Minister this evening (July 09) to decide on appointing a new Inspector-General of Police (IGP) due to impending retirement of Wickramaratne. Meanwhile, President Wickremesinghe had reportedly tasked Minister Alles with deciding whether former IGP C.D. Wickramaratne should be given another tenure extension or an Acting IGP should be appointed. Wickramaratne was initially supposed to retire from the police service on March 26, 2023, however, President Wickremesinghe extended his tenure by three months until June 26 by way of a special gazette notification dated April 06. Thus, the position of IGP was set to be vacant since the end of Wickramaratnes tenure on 26 June.

He stated that the project is expected to conclude by the end of September next year. Addressing a media briefing today (09), the Minister further added that an expenditure of USD 60.2 million will have to be incurred by the government to conclude the entire project. A special inspection tour of the Port Access Elevated Highway Project was led by the Minister today, along with a group of Chinese stakeholders involved in the project. The relevant project was commenced in 2019 to alleviate traffic congestion in the densely populated areas of Colombo, improve last-mile connectivity from the countrys expressway network to the international port in Colombo, provide better logistics services for freight operations, and to facilitate regional trade. The project includes the construction of an elevated toll highway spanning approximately 5.3 kilometres between the New Kelani Bridge and Galle Face in Colombo, which aims to provide a direct link to the City center and the Port from the Colombo- Katunayake Expressway via the New Kelani Bridge. The Port Access Highway Project was originally scheduled to be concluded in 2023, however, delays occurred due to the fallout of the economic crisis in the country last year. Commenting further regarding the matter, Gunawardena emphasized that the Asian Development Bank (ADB) acts as the main lender of the project, adding that out of the total cost of USD 360.2 million, the ADB provides USD 300 million as such the local government should incur USD 60.2 million.",

Two boats, one carrying about 65 people and the other with between 50 and 60 on board, have been missing for 15 days since they left Senegal to try to reach Spain, Helena Maleno of Walking Borders told Reuters. A third boat left Senegal on June 27 with about 200 people aboard. The families of those on board have not heard from them since they left, Maleno said. All three boats left Kafountine in the south of Senegal, which is about 1,700 kilometres (1,057 miles) from Tenerife, one of the Canary Islands. The families are very worried. There about 300 people from the same area of Senegal. They have left because of the instability in Senegal, Maleno said. The Canary Islands off the coast of West Africa have become the main destination for migrants trying to reach Spain, with a much smaller number also seeking to cross the Mediterranean Sea to the Spanish mainland. Summer is the busiest period for all attempted crossings. The Atlantic migration route, one of the deadliest in the world, is typically used by migrants from sub-Saharan Africa.

        "title": "Pope Francis names 21 new cardinals",
        "date": "July 10, 2023 12:18 pm",
        "content": "Pope Francis on Sunday announced he has chosen 21 new cardinals, including prelates from Jerusalem and Hong Kong  places where Catholics are a small minority  as he continues to leave his mark on the body of churchmen who will select his successor. The pope announced his picks during his customary weekly appearance to the public in St. Peters Square, saying the ceremony to formally install the churchmen as cardinals will be held on Sept. 30. Among those tapped are several prelates holding or about to assume major Vatican posts, including the archbishop from La Plata, Argentina, Archbishop Victor Manuel Fernández, 59, whom the pope just named to lead the Holy Sees powerful office for ensuring doctrinal orthodoxy a nd overseeing processing of allegations of sexual abuse against clergy worldwide. The new cardinals also include Hong Kong Bishop Stephen Sau-yan Chow, 64, and the Vaticans top official in the Middle East, Monsignor Pierbattista Pizzaballa, 58, the Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem. Those two churchmen guide flocks in geopolitical areas of keen concern to the Vatican. On Sunday, in remarks preceding his reading out of the list of new cardinals, Pope Francis expressed hope that Israeli and Palestinian authorities would take up direct dialogue to end the spiral of violence  a reference to recent deadly clashes. Francis repeatedly has cited the hardships of the Christian minority in the Middle East in recent decades. In an interview in April with The Associated Press, Pizzaballa, an Italian prelate who is the top Catholic churchman in the Holy Land, said that the regions 2,000-year-old Christian community has come under increasing attack, with the most right-wing government in Israels history emboldening extremists who have harassed clergy and vandalized religious property at a quickening pace. For decades, the Vatican and China have experienced tensions alternating with improvement of relations over the Communist-led nations insistence that it has the right to appoint bishops and the jailing of priests who professed loyalty to the pope. Earlier this year, the Hong Kong bishop, who, like Francis, is a Jesuit, made the first visit to mainland China in nearly 30 years by a prelate in that post. Chow told reporters Monday that it was somewhat unbelievable to learn about the news. It is a new mission  a mission that God assigned (to me) through the pope, he said. In announcing their names, Francis said the appointment of cardinals from across the globe expresses the universality of the Church that continues to announce the merciful love of God to all men of the Earth. Cardinals serve as advisers to the pontiff on matters of teaching and administration, including the Vaticans scandal-plagued finances. But their most crucial duty is gathering in a secret conclave to elect the next pontiff. Francis has now named nine batches of new cardinals in his 10-year papacy. Even before this latest group, he had already appointed the large majority of those eligible to elect the next pontiff  those aged under 80. With the latest appointments, the number of cardinals who meet that condition stands at 137. That means, increasingly, the men who will vote for whoever succeeds Francis, in the event of his resignation or death, are churchmen supportive of his values, priorities and perspectives and who share his vision for the future of the Catholic Church. Three of the churchmen chosen to receive the cardinal red work in Africa, a continent where the Church has experience growth in recent decades. They are Monsignor Stephen Brislin, 66, archbishop of Cape Town, South Africa; Monsignor Protase Rugambwa, 63, co-adjutor archbishop of Tabora, Tanzania; and Monsignor Stephen Ameyu Martin Mulla, 59, archbishop of Juba, South Sudan, which the pope visited earlier this year. The office that Francis appointed Fernández to is traditionally headed by a cardinal. But the speed with which the La Plata archbishop was tapped publicly as a cardinal  eight days after the appointment  was notable and highlights the attention the pontiff gives to that office. A U.S.-based group that tracks how the Catholic hierarchy deals with allegations of sexual abuse by clergy says Francis made a troubling choice in picking the Argentine archbishop, who, in 2019, refused to believe victims who accused a priest in that archdiocese of sexually abusing boys. Two others holding important offices at the Vatican were also among the popes picks on Sunday. They are the Chicago-born Monsignor Robert Francis Prevost, 67, who heads the Dicastery for Bishops; and Monsignor Claudio Gugerotti, 67, an Italian in charge of the Dicastery for Eastern Churches. Also on the list are: Monsignor Americo Manuel Alves Aguiar, an auxiliary bishop from Lisbon, Portugal, which the pope will visit next month for a Catholic youth jamboree, was also on the list. At 49, he is exceptionally young for a cardinal. Monsignor Sebastian Francis, 71, bishop of Penang, Malaysia, who heads the bishops conference of Malaysia, Singapore and Brunei; Monsignor Francois-Xavier Bustillo, 54, a Franciscan and native Spaniard who is bishop of Ajaccio, on the French island of Corsica; Monsignor Luis Jose Rueda Aparicio, 71, archbishop of Bogota, Colombia; and Monsignor Grzegorz Rys, 59, archbishop of Lodz, Poland. Monsignor Emil Paul Tscherrig, 76, a Swiss prelate who is the first non-Italian to serve as papal ambassador to Italy and San Marino; and Monsignor Christopher Louis Yves Pierre, 77, a Frenchman whose diplomatic postings included Washington, D.C. Monsignor Angel Sixto Rossi, 64, a Jesuit who is archbishop of his native Cordoba, Argentina; Monsignor Jose Cobo Cano, 57, who was just appointed last month by Francis to be archbishop of Madrid; and the Rev. Angel Fernández Artime, 62, a Spaniard who is rector major of the Salesians, a congregation of priests present in 133 countries. Three of the 21 new cardinals are 80 or older and thus not eligible to vote in a conclave. They are Italian prelate, Agostino Marchetto, 82, who served as the top Vatican diplomat in Belarus, Madagascar, Mauritius and Tanzania; Monsignor Diego Rafael Padron Sanchez, 84, archbishop emeritus of Cumana, Venezuela; and a Franciscan priest, Luis Pascual Dri, 96, famed for hearing confessions in the popes native Buenos Aires and who has been praised by Francis for his stress on mercy.

        "content": "Two Sri Lankan nationals, identified as father and son, have reportedly drowned in Trebbia, Italy. According to Italian media reports, the tragedy took place on the afternoon of Saturday 8 July, under the Donceto bridge, near Rondanera beach, in the presence of numerous bathers who crowded the banks of the river. The victims, aged 59 and 28, originally from Sri Lanka and who were residing in Piacenza, have been identified as father and son; Lesly Kilaster Tisera Warnakulasuriya and Dulaj Nilanjan Tisera Warnakulasuriya. The alarm was triggered around 4.30 pm when the disappearance of the two swimmers was reported. The firefighters from Bobbio and also the team of divers from Bologna arrived on the spot with the Drago firefighters helicopter: it was the latter who pulled the two victims out of the waters of the Trebbia. The Carabinieri of Rivergaro and the 118 health workers of Bobbio were also in place. The drowning occurred at the height of the waterfall, at the road viaduct, a point where a hole at least three meters deep forms and whirlpools and currents are created, which can be very dangerous for those who choose to take a bath. According to an initial reconstruction, the son would have been the first to find himself in difficulty, while the father would have thrown himself to try to save him: unfortunately, when help arrived on the spot, they had already drowned.

        "title": "Countrys education system to undergo transformation  Minister",
        "date": "July 10, 2023 06:14 pm",
        "content": "Minister of Education Susil Premajayantha has revealed that the countrys education system will undergo an educational transformation and essential measures will be taken to produce students who are prepared for the twenty-first century. Speaking at a press conference held at the Presidential Media Center (PMC) themed Collective Path to a Stable Country, the Minister stated that human resources will be managed for that purpose and education will be reformatted in accordance with global standards in order to produce a sustainable and high-quality education. The Minister added that the Suraksha Sisu Rakshanaya insurance scheme introduced for school children which was suspended due to the financial crisis will resume in 2024. Speaking at the occasion, Premajayantha further commented; In developed countries, the Ministry of Education acts as a separate entity from the Central Government and a Provincial Minister is in charge of the Ministry of Education. The educational rights of children in countries like India, Canada and Japan have been safeguarded as a result of this educational pattern. The Ministry of Education in Sri Lanka is under the control of the Central Government. All schools in our country, with the exception of 399, are governed by the Provincial Ministries of education. The initiative to establish 1,000 national schools was launched in 2001. When the 13th Constitutional Amendment was initiated, there were 17 national schools in this country. However, as a result of political initiatives or the requests of individual Education Ministers, there was a dramatic rise in the number of national schools. However, one cannot say that it led to high-quality education. There was a period in time when 28 national schools were created overnight. But right now, the education industry needs to undergo a transformative change. Instead of the exam-centred education system, students should be aligned in a student-centred education pattern. There was a significant setback in education as a result of Covid-19 and the recent economic downturn. Additionally, socio economic issues made it impossible to run the schools effectively due to fuel and gas concerns. Federation of University Teachers Associations (FUTA) and Teacher trade unions did not attend to evaluate the answer sheet of the Advanced Level examination. The evaluation of the A-Level exam questions has been completed, and that matter is now resolved. I think the exam results could be released in the middle of the next month. The A-Level exams for this year are scheduled to take place in December, according to the Ministry of Education. The Ministry of Education has taken steps to hold all the examinations in the prescribed year. Also, the program needed to reform the new education is currently being implemented. Plans have been made to start teaching activities through English medium in association with the British Council. For this purpose, 13,800 teachers have been trained so far. The updating of textbooks for English was also started promptly. The addition of Artificial Intelligence and Information Technology to the curriculum is proposed for two grade levels, Grade 6-9 and Grade 10-13. We are attempting to secure Information Technology assistance for this from companies like Microsoft. About fifty principal positions are open. While conducting a competitive examination for the recruitment, a trade union went to court and got an injunction. For the recruitment of teacher administration services, there are roughly 22000 openings. Government employees who applied for the position have also gone to court to explain why they are unable to take the competitive exam. The recruitment process has thus far been delayed as a result. Due to 100 peoples human rights being brought up in court, 4.2 million students human rights have already been violated. As a result, we think the court will rule on this issue quickly. We are working to continue the 13 plus education program presented by the President when he was the Prime Minister. A selection committee has been established to expand the education sector and the necessary proposals are currently being prepared. Accordingly, the necessary program to expand education will be prepared jointly with Non-Governmental Organizations in the future. Arrangements are being made to provide loan facilities to Non-Government Universities as well as to create an environment where they can contribute to the economy of this country. It is intended to establish a training University in Kotagala to train students who choose to go to a plantation in order to safeguard the educational rights of the children of estate workers. By substantially bolstering the regulating program of private and international schools, we are committed to ensuring childrens right to education. With regard to all of these issues, we are working to bring about a change in education from next year.",

The Secretary to the Ministry of Plantation Industries was recommended to inform within two weeks the action to be taken by involving all the three institutions. Meanwhile, instructions were also given to restore the already-existing online system facilitating virtual bidding in coconut auctions within the next three months, in a bid to end the monopoly and create transparency in the said auction. During the meeting, it was revealed that 187,623 metric tons of coconut oil and 225,510 metric tons of palm oil have been imported for consumption in the country during 2020-2022. Thus, serious concerns were raised about the fact that only 22 of the coconut oil consumption in the country is met from domestic production, while the remaining 78 is met imported oil. Hence, COPE called for a comprehensive investigation in this regard, highlighting the need to increase domestic coconut oil production and curb substandard imported coconut oil. Other irregularities, including the payment of and advance of Rs. 1 million for the construction of a digital billboard without a contract, the recruitment of six people who did not properly appear for interviews of the CCB, the loss of Rs. 21 million incurred due to an infrastructure addition to the CCB building without prior approval, were also discussed at length. The CDA, CCB and the CRI were summoned before COPE on 06 July, under the chairmanship of Prof. Ranjith Bandara, with MPs Jagath Pushpakumara, Shantha Bandara, Anura Priyadarshan Yapa, Mahindananda Aluthgamage, Dayasiri Jayasekara, Eran Wickramaratne, Nimal Lanza, SMM Muszhaaraff, Sanjeeva Edirimanna, Upul Mahendra Rajapaksha, Rajika Wickramasinghe, Madhura Withanage, and Prof. Charitha Herath also present.",

The president gave his assessment of the events of June 24, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said, referring to the failed insurrection, adding that Putin also listened to accounts given by (Wagner) commanders. Just over two weeks after the aborted mutiny, there is still significant uncertainty surrounding the fate of the Wagner group and the deal that ended the rebellion against Russias top military brass. Under the plan, the mercenary chief and some of his fighters were expected to be exiled to Belarus. Wagner troops that wanted to keep fighting for Russia meanwhile would sign contracts with the conventional army. During the three-and-a-half-hour meeting in the Kremlin with Wagner commanders, Putin offered them alternative options for employment, including in combat roles. Observers see the rebellion as the biggest challenge to Putins authority since he came to power Wagner commanders stressed that they are staunch supporters... of the head of state, Peskov said. They also said that they were ready to continue fighting for the motherland. On Thursday, Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko  who acted as a mediator in the deal with Wagner  said that neither Prigozhin nor his men were in his country.
