        "title": "India gifts Furosemide injections to Sri Lanka following urgent request",
        "date": "March 14, 2025 06:34 am",
        "content": "India has donated urgently-needed medicines to Sri Lanka responding to an urgent request from Colombo, the Indian High Commission said here on Thursday. India gifted 50,000 ampoules of Furosemide injection 20mg2ml to cater to its shortage in Sri Lankan hospitals in the immediate term. These were handed over by Santosh Jha, the High Commissioner of India to Sri Lanka, to the Minister of Health and Mass Media Nalinda Jayatissa. India has been a reliable friend and first responder for Sri Lanka during times of difficulties and shortages, including in the health sector, a release from the Indian High Commission said. During the Covid-19 pandemic, India supplied over 25 tonnes of medicines on a special aircraft to Sri Lanka in May 2020; gifted 5,00,000 doses of Covishield vaccine in January 2021; and 1 lakh Rapid Antigen Test kits in February 2022, it said. In the wake of the economic crisis in Sri Lanka, in February 2022, a USD 1 billion credit facility for supply of essential items, including medicines, was extended in March 2022 for a period of one year. It was subsequently extended until March 2024 on the request of the Sri Lankan government. Over 26 tonnes of drugs and other medical supplies were provided to Peradeniya University Hospital, Jaffna Teaching Hospital, Hambantota General Hospital, among others, in April-May 2022 to meet the acute shortage of medicines, the release said. The health sector has also been an important focus area for Indias development cooperation initiatives in Sri Lanka. Notable initiatives include the island-wide 1990 Suwa Seriya ambulance service; construction of 150-bed multi-specialty hospital at Dickoya; construction of a new surgical unit at Teaching Hospital, Batticaloa; infrastructure creation and up-gradation, as well as equipment supply, at Jaffna Teaching Hospital, District Hospitals at Kilinochchi and Mullaitivu; among others, the release added.

        "title": "Russia seeks to exclude key Trump envoy from Ukraine talks, sources say",
        "date": "March 14, 2025 06:57 am",
        "content": "Russian officials have communicated to their counterparts in the United States that they do not want Russia-Ukraine envoy Keith Kellogg involved in top-level discussions aimed at ending the Ukraine war, according to a U.S. official and another source with knowledge of the matter. Kellogg has been personally absent from some high-level discussions in recent weeks, including a meeting involving U.S. National Security Adviser Mike Waltz and Secretary of State Marco Rubio with a Ukrainian delegation in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday. He was also absent at a high-level meeting with Russians in Saudi Arabia in February. It was not immediately clear if Kelloggs absence was linked to the Russian officials request, and it was not clear when the request was made. The U.S. official said the request had not been heeded, citing the fact that Kellogg sent a high-ranking member of his staff, Eli Rosner, to attend the latest Saudi meeting. The Russian embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment. National Security Council spokesperson James Hewitt said Kellogg was playing a crucial role in bringing the Ukraine war to an end. President Trump has utilized the talents of multiple senior administration officials to assist in the bringing the war in Ukraine to a peaceful resolution, Hewitt said on Thursday evening. Russias expanded invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 has left hundreds of thousands of dead and injured, displaced millions of people, reduced towns to rubble and triggered the sharpest confrontation for decades between Moscow and the West. The U.S. and Ukraine agreed to a 30-day ceasefire in principle during their meeting in Saudi Arabia earlier in the week. But Russian President Vladimir Putin suggested on Thursday that the ceasefire bid needs serious reworking. The Kremlins request to exclude Kellogg, first reported by NBC News, comes as some high-ranking former Russian officials have complained that Trumps envoy is, in their view, too sympathetic to Kyiv. A retired lieutenant general, Kellogg has at times been more critical of Russian aggression in Ukraine than other administration officials. For instance, he sharply criticized Russia for a large-scale Christmastime attack on Ukrainian population centers. Christmas should be a time of peace, yet Ukraine was brutally attacked on Christmas Day, Kellogg wrote on Dec. 25 on X. Launching large-scale missile and drone attacks on the day of the Lords birth is wrong. Still, Kellogg has consistently defended Trumps positions on the Ukraine war, including a recent decision to pause some intelligence sharing with Kyiv. Kellogg served as the chief of staff to the National Security Council during Trumps 2017-2021 term and as the national security adviser to then-Vice President Mike Pence. He met with President Volodymyr Zelenskiy in Kyiv in February, and has met with a number of NATO leaders throughout Europe. While some Trump supporters have privately argued Kellogg is too hawkish for their liking, others have said it benefits Trump to have advisers and envoys with different profiles and ideological backgrounds.

        "title": "Trump threatens retaliatory 200 tariff on European wine after EU proposes American whiskey tax",
        "date": "March 14, 2025 09:44 am",
        "content": "President Donald Trump on Thursday threatened a 200 tariff on European wine, Champagne and spirits if the European Union goes forward with a planned tariff on American whiskey. The European import tax, which was unveiled in response to steel and aluminum tariffs by the U.S. administration, is expected to go into effect April 1, just ahead of separate reciprocal tariffs that Trump plans to place on the EU. But Trump, in a morning social media post, vowed a new escalation in his trade war if the EU goes forward with the planned 50 tax on American whiskey. If this Tariff is not removed immediately, the U.S. will shortly place a 200 Tariff on all WINES, CHAMPAGNES,  ALCOHOLIC PRODUCTS COMING OUT OF FRANCE AND OTHER E.U. REPRESENTED COUNTRIES, Trump wrote. This will be great for the Wine and Champagne businesses in the U.S. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said Thursday that the EU trade commissioner would be having a phone call Friday with his U.S. counterpart. We dont like tariffs because we think tariffs are taxes and they are bad for business and they are bad for consumers, she said. We have always said at the same time that we will defend our interests. Weve said it, and weve shown it, but at the same time I also want to emphasize that we are open for negotiations. The U.S. president has defined his opening weeks in the White House with near daily drama regarding tariffs, saying that taxing imports might cause some economic pain but would eventually lead to more domestic manufacturing and greater respect for America. The SP 500 stock index fell 1.4 on Thursday, while European alcohol stocks also tumbled. But with the EU and Trump now tussling over alcohol tariffs, the impact of a trade war could surface directly in ways consumers could quickly see. Its unclear how the import taxes would be absorbed among vintners, distillers, brewers, distributors, retailers and consumers. Because of Trumps threat, a previously untariffed 15 bottle of Italian Prosecco could possibly increase in price to 45. Similarly, Europes response to Trumps steel and aluminum tariffs means that the cost of a 30-euro bottle of bourbon in Paris could increase to 45 euros. Holly Seidewand, owner of First Fill Spirits, a shop in Saratoga Springs, New York, said before Trump threatened the tariffs on European alcohol, the spirits industry was already reeling from layoff announcements in the Kentucky Bourbon sector and the tariffs planned by the EU on American spirits. This ongoing tariff war doesnt just harm importers  it weakens domestic brands, disrupts distributors, and squeezes retailers who rely on global selections, she said. In the end, consumers will bear the brunt of it all. Gabriel Picard, who heads the French Federation of Exporters of Wines and Spirits, said 200 tariffs would be a hammer blow for the sector. He said the U.S. market is worth 4 billion euros (4.3 billion) annually for French exporters of wines and spirits. Not a single bottle will continue to be expedited if 200 tariffs are applied to our products. All exports to the United States will come to a total, total, halt, Picard said in an interview with The Associated Press. With 200 duties, there is no more market. As of now, Europe seems unwilling to back down. Trump is escalating the trade war he has chosen, Laurent Saint-Martin, the French delegate minister for foreign trade, said on X. France, together with the European Commission and our partners, is determined to fight back. We will not give in to threats and will always protect our industries. Trumps latest tariff threats suggested that even companies that have publicly stood by him could be collateral damage, raising questions about whether the wider business community would be willing to openly challenge a series of trade wars that have hurt the stock market and scared consumers who worry about inflation worsening. Bernard Arnault, the CEO of French luxury goods company LVMH, attended Trumps inauguration in January. His companys wine and spirits brands, which include Moët  Chandon, Krug, Veuve Clicquot and Hennessy, could be subject to the retaliatory tariffs the U.S. president is seeking. The Italy-based Campari Group could also be hurt, after the White House highlighted it at Tuesdays press briefing for possibly opening a U.S. factory. Still, Trump feels aggrieved by the EU, complaining to reporters on Thursday about the lack of U.S. auto sales there as well as the lawsuits and fines filed against Google and Facebook parent Meta. They are suing all of these companies, and theyre taking billions of dollars out of American companies, Trump said. And I guess theyre using it to run Europe or something. Trump, in announcing the new steel and aluminum tariffs on Wednesday, openly challenged U.S. allies and vowed to take back wealth stolen by other countries, and he drew quick retaliation. He has separate tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China, with plans to also tax imports from the European Union, Brazil and South Korea by charging reciprocal rates starting on April 2. The EU announced its own countermeasures. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said that as the United States was applying tariffs worth 28 billion dollars, we are responding with countermeasures worth 26 billion euros, or about 28 billion. Those measures cover not just steel and aluminum products but also textiles, home appliances and agricultural goods. European Commission spokesman Olof Gill said Thursday shortly before Trumps announcement that the EU was prepared for whatever might come, and we have been preparing for over a year. We call on the U.S. to immediately revoke the tariffs imposed yesterday, and we want to negotiate to avoid tariffs in the future, Gill added. They bring nothing but lose-lose outcomes, and we want to focus on win-win outcomes. U.S. whiskey makers, meanwhile, encouraged Trump to broker a deal. We urge President Trump to secure a spirits agreement with the EU to get us back to zero-for-zero tariffs, which will create U.S. jobs and increase manufacturing and exports for the American hospitality sector, Chris Swonger, president and CEO of the Distilled Spirits Council, said in a statement. When Europe responded to Trumps 2018 tariffs with a 25 tax on U.S. whiskey, exports to the EU fell by 20 through 2021, according to the Distilled Spirits Council. Trumps separate 25 tariffs on Canada and Mexico could put 31,000 jobs at risk in the sector. Source: AP --Agencies",

        "title": "Batalanda Commission report tabled in Parliament: calls for justice, accountability",
        "date": "March 14, 2025 10:46 am",
        "content": "The Batalanda Commission report was presented to the Parliament this morning (14) by Leader of the House, Minister Bimal Ratnayake. The Concluding Observation Notes of the 159 page report submitted by the commission states that the period from 1988 to 1990 was one of the darkest and most violent chapters in Sri Lankas history, marked by a cycle of terror that engulfed the nation and that the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) engaged in widespread insurgency, while state and non-state forces responded with brutal countermeasures, often outside the boundaries of the law. The Batalanda Commission Report confirms that forces operating beyond the formal government structure, including shadowy search teams, carried out extrajudicial actions with the tacit approval of law enforcement agencies and elements within the government. In certain instances, these groups worked in coordination with official security forces, engaging in kidnappings, assassinations, and other illicit methods to suppress the insurgency, the report added, noting that while the government was determined to eliminate the insurrection, it showed little concern for the legality of the methods used to achieve this objective. Evidence presented to the commission underscores the governments failure to prevent extrajudicial killings and its active role in shielding those responsible. A striking example was revealed in the testimony of the then Inspector General of Police (IGP), who stated that a senior police officerimplicated in the murder of journalist Richard de Zoysawas shielded from arrest due to interference by the then Deputy Minister of State Security. In another case, government funds were allegedly used to cover the legal expenses of three police officers indicted for the murder of lawyer Wijedasa Liyanarachchi, the reports Observation Notes highlighted. While the JVPs violent actions led to the deaths of hundreds of politicians, police officers, and civilians, and severely disrupted essential services, the governments response should have adhered to the rule of law. Instead, the state resorted to counterterrorism through terror, with ruling party politicians at times directing police operations and actively participating in crackdowns. The infamous Batalanda torture camp stands as a grim symbol of these excesses, it added. The commission strongly condemned the governments approach, stating: No matter the extent of provocation by the JVP, the government should never have sanctioned or directed extrajudicial actions in response. The attempt to suppress terrorism with state terrorism resulted not only in the elimination of actual insurgents but also in the deaths of many innocent young people who had no involvement in illegal activities. Key Recommendations of the Commission The Batalanda Commission made several recommendations to prevent such atrocities in the future and ensure that law enforcement operates within legal frameworks. Among them are; Legislative Reforms: The commission proposed the formulation of a Code of Conduct for politicians regarding their role in law enforcement during emergencies. It also recommended amendments to the Constitution and other laws to reinforce accountability. Judicial Oversight: Magistrates should be given investigative powers to examine reports of illegal detention centers and human rights abuses, ensuring cases are referred to the Attorney General for prosecution. Accountability for Law Enforcement: The Inspector General of Police (IGP) was urged to conduct full investigations into police officers implicated in crimes such as abduction, murder, and unlawful detention and take necessary disciplinary action. Enhanced Judicial Powers: The Supreme Court should be empowered with additional jurisdiction to impose appropriate penalties in the form of deprivation of civil rights on individuals who are found to have repeatedly violated the fundamental rights of citizens, ensuring that impunity does not continue.

        "content": "The closed-circuit television (CCTV) surveillance system installed for the security of Anuradhapura city is currently inactive, raising concerns among residents, officials, and legal professionals. Although 47 cameras were installed under this system, none are currently operational, significantly affecting crime detection and law enforcement efforts, officials said. The North Central Provincial Council had initially installed CCTV systems in Anuradhapura, Habarana, and Polonnaruwa in 2017 at a cost of Rs. 7 million. The primary objective of the project was to support police investigations into crimes and other irregularities in the city. However, the surveillance system became defunct in April 2024 when the service agreement with the private company responsible for its maintenance expired. Given Anuradhapuras status as a major tourist destination, locals emphasize the urgent need for a functioning surveillance system to ensure public safety. The non-operational cameras have raised concerns about the potential increase in criminal activity, including drug trafficking. When contacted for comment, the Governor of the North Central Province Wasantha Jinadasa acknowledged the issue and assured that steps would be taken to restore surveillance. We contacted the relevant institution, and they informed us that the existing CCTV system cannot be restored due to its expiration. They have promised to submit proposals for a new system, but we have not received any yet. However, we are committed to activating a new system as soon as possible, Governor Jinadasa said.",

        "title": "No economy can sustain construction sector entirely dependent on govt investments: CBSL Governor",
        "date": "March 14, 2025 03:09 pm",
        "content": "The Governor of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) Dr. Nandalal Weerasinghe emphasized the importance of promoting a sustainable and cost-effective construction industry in the country, highlighting key challenges and opportunities in the sector. Speaking at Construction Expo 2025 on Friday (14), Dr. Weerasinghe underscored the need for Sri Lanka to align with global trends in sustainable construction, integrating cost-effective energy solutions and eco-friendly building practices. I must say my views here are not necessarily as a Governor of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka, but as a person looking at this construction industry and how this can be developed and what the issues are. Sustainability in construction is essential, not just for new projects but also for existing buildings, he noted. Dr. Weerasinghe acknowledged that the construction sector has been one of the hardest-hit industries due to multiple economic pressures in recent years including the decline in public investments, high material costs and the industry being dependent on government projects. The CBSL Governor, who acknowledged that the government faced fiscal constraints, limiting infrastructure spending and delaying payments to contractors, said that however, the outstanding arrears had now been settled. Government did not have space to spend money for public investment, specially construction that had an impact on the construction does a significant in last couple of years, plus the government inability to pay the arrears for long period. That was other issue we all recognize that has been one of the adverse impact the industry had in the past, he expressed. Also the cost of materials went up significantly, partly because of the shortages in foreign exchange. As a result, the shortage had shot up the prices of construction materials, as well as depreciation of the currency, high interest rates, finance costs, those other factors. We all recognize that had an adverse impact on the industry. Its one of the worst affected the industry because of all these factors. Furthermore, Dr. Weerasinghe added: When you look at this now, I think from the overall macro factors, Im gladI know from the Ministry of Finance, Treasury Secretary, all the arrears were settled. Almost all the areas were settled. Theres no running arrears, I think, for last couple of months, working progress. Secondly, in terms of the government allocation for the public investment, I saw in one of your publications say that is not sufficient, but what I can say, this year budget has allocated 1.3 trillion public investment, most of basically are mainly have something to do with the construction sector, I think, large component. When you look at the amount, that is a significant amount, and that probably include some of the projects thats going to be to be resumed after suspension, especially after the crew structuring. The foreign funded projects are also going to be started. I think President made this comment in one of the forums that I was also there earlier. So, these are good positive signs. One is, I think, one thing I have been always saying, industry not to rely too much on the governments public investment. In any country, construction is not only the government business. It will have a much broader contribution throughout the economy to the private sector, to low-income people, to middle-income people, to everyone. That is why its important, construction industry should be much more diversified, should rely on much larger private and public part, not relying on one part. Thats what we learned. Last time, large part of construction industry developed in several decades out of the public investment. And whenever it comes to crisis of the sovereign debt, then obviously you all had the impact, he added. Sri Lankas cost of construction is relatively higher than even comparable markets. We dont compete with advanced countries cost of construction, but even in the region, countries like ours, still we all know its relatively high. While acknowledging the governments role in facilitating infrastructure growth, he cautioned against relying solely on state funding, stating, no economy can sustain a construction sector dependent entirely on public investment. The industry must broaden its business model, including export opportunities and private sector projects. The 2025 budget has allocated Rs. 1.3 trillion for public investment, a substantial portion of which is expected to support construction, he noted, highlighting that efficient use of these funds would be critical, urging the industry to maximize output per rupee spent. The second one, we all know the labor cost. Lack of skilled labor is one thing that you cant solve within short period. That is where the role of the government is to support the enhanced skill up the available labor, and encourage bringing even industry can bring in more technology, less labor, more output. This is something I always talk about when you look at construction site in Sri Lanka and somewhere else, number of people working in a site is relatively high in Sri Lanka. Number of technologies being used in other markets are relatively higher, less labor, high technology. Thats something I think we need to move in, cant do it. But for that, you need skilled labor, well-trained, and that also help them to have high income. Thats one of the reasons why the low-skilled labor are not willing to, even educated youth are not willing to work in construction sector. They are relatively low-income. If you have a technologically equipped, more skilled labor, that is part of government. Im glad that you have program to enhance their skills. Thats one way to address that part. This will take some time, the CBSL Governor expressed. Dr. Weerasinghe concluded by emphasizing the need for long-term policy reforms to make Sri Lankas construction sector more competitive, sustainable, and cost-efficient, expressing, A more efficient construction industry benefits everyonefrom low-income families building homes to large-scale industrial projects.",

The former central banker, who has never held public office in Canada, is stepping in to confront the challenges facing the country, including US presidents sweeping tariffs, and to lead the Liberal Party into an election to be held later this year. Carney was sworn in after Trudeau stepped down earlier Friday after nearly a decade in power.

In a farewell message posted on X on Friday, Trudeau said: Thank you, Canada  for trusting in me, for challenging me, and for granting me the privilege to serve the best country, and the best people, on earth.

        "content": "Officials from the Ministry of Finance presented the steps taken to increase excise duty on cigarettes before the Committee on Public Finance (CoPF) under the Order under Section 3 of the Excise (Special Provisions) Act, No. 13 of 1989. The presentation was made during the Committee on Public Finance meeting held on March 11, 2025, in Parliament, chaired by MP (Dr.) Harsha de Silva, according to the Parliamentary Communications Department. The Committee stated that the increase in excise duty on cigarettes could not be approved without concrete data and emphasized the need for justification regarding the steps taken to increase the excise duty, as discussed in the previous Committee meeting. It was also pointed out that studies on excise revenue from cigarettes indicate that the current calculation method has led to a decline in government revenue while increasing the profits of certain manufacturing companies. Therefore, the Committee stressed the importance of ensuring that this tax revision would indeed benefit government revenue. Consequently, it was decided to reconsider the matter following further clarifications from Ministry of Finance officials regarding the excise duty increase. After an extensive discussion, the Committee approved the Order under Section 3 of the Excise (Special Provisions) Act, No. 13 of 1989. Additionally, two Orders under the Special Commodity Levy Act, No. 48 of 2007, were considered and subsequently approved. The Order under Section 5 of the Special Commodity Levy Act, No. 48 of 2007, published in Gazette Extraordinary No. 241720, sought to extend the validity period of the Special Levy imposed on 63 commodities, including essential food items, at the same rates after obtaining recommendations from the relevant line ministries. The Order under Section 5 of the Special Commodity Levy Act, No. 48 of 2007, published in Gazette Extraordinary No. 242103, sought to grant tax concessions for dates imported for free distribution during the Ramadan fasting period, the statement highlighted. The Committee on Public Finance also considered and approved the protocol amending Section 28(6) of the Agreement between the governments of Sri Lanka and India for the avoidance of double taxation and the prevention of fiscal evasion with respect to income taxes. This agreement was signed at the government level in India on 16th December 2024. The meeting was attended by Deputy Minister Dr. Harshana Suriyapperuma, along with Members of Parliament Ravi Karunanayake, Dr. Kaushalya Ariyaratne, Wijesiri Basnayake, Arkam Ilyas, Nimal Palihena, and Lakmali Hemachandra, Attorney-at-Law.",

        "content": "Sri Lankan-born Gary Anandasangaree has been sworn in as the Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, as well as the Minister of Crown-Indigenous Relations and Northern Affairs, during a swearing-in ceremony at Rideau Hall in Ottawa on Friday. The ceremony marked the appointment of new prime minister Mark Carney and a streamlined cabinet, with the Indigenous affairs ministers remaining unchanged. Indigenous groups from across Canada extended their congratulations to Prime Minister Mark Carney while emphasizing the importance of collaboration to address funding gaps, service needs, and challenges posed by the Trump administration. Following his appointment, Anandasangaree expressed his gratitude in a post on X (formerly Twitter), stating, Honoured to serve as Minister of Justice and Attorney General, while continuing the work at Crown-Indigenous Relations and Northern Affairs. We will protect the Charter, uphold the rule of law, and stay true to Canadian values. Ready to get to work with Prime Minister of Canada and Leader of the Liberal Party Mark Carney. Born in Jaffna, Sri Lanka, in 1973, Anandasangaree is the son of V. Anandasangaree, a prominent Sri Lankan Tamil politician and leader of the Tamil United Liberation Front (TULF). His political career began when he joined the Liberal Party of Canada. In 2013, he announced his candidacy for the Liberal nomination in ScarboroughRouge Park for the 2015 federal election. He won the nomination in August 2014 and subsequently secured victory in the October 19, 2015, election with 60.1 of the vote. Anandasangaree has been a strong advocate for human rights in Parliament, notably speaking on International Human Rights Day about welcoming Syrian refugees and supporting an Iranian scholar, Dr. Hossein Raessi, who was granted protection through a joint initiative between Carleton University and the University of Ottawa. He has played a key role in Indigenous affairs, serving on the Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Committee in the 42nd Canadian Parliament. In May 2021, he was appointed Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Crown-Indigenous Relations, and later that year, he became Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada. On July 26, 2023, he was appointed Minister of Crown-Indigenous Relations. During the 2025 Liberal Party of Canada leadership election, Anandasangaree endorsed Mark Carney, who now serves as Canadas Prime Minister. --With Agencies Input Honoured to serve as Minister of Justice and Attorney General, while continuing the work at Crown-Indigenous Relations and Northern Affairs.

        "title": "ISIS chief in Syria Abu Khadija killed by Iraq forces",
        "date": "March 15, 2025 02:43 pm",
        "content": "The head of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria has been killed in Iraq in an operation by members of the Iraqi national intelligence service along with U.S.-led coalition forces, the Iraqi prime minister announced Friday. The Iraqis continue their impressive victories over the forces of darkness and terrorism, Prime Minister Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani said in a statement posted on X, formerly known as Twitter. Abdallah Maki Mosleh al-Rifai, or Abu Khadija, was deputy caliph of the militant group and as one of the most dangerous terrorists in Iraq and the world, the statement said. On his Truth Social platform Friday night, U.S. President Donald Trump said: Today the fugitive leader of ISIS in Iraq was killed. He was relentlessly hunted down by our intrepid warfighters in coordination with the Iraqi government and the Kurdish regional government. PEACE THROUGH STRENGTH! Trump posted. A security official said the operation was carried out by an airstrike in Anbar province, in western Iraq. A second official said the operation took place Thursday night but that al-Rifais death was confirmed Friday. They spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to comment publicly. The announcement came on the same day as the first visit by Syrias top diplomat to Iraq, during which the two countries pledged to work together to combat IS. Iraqi Foreign Minister Fouad Hussein said at a news conference that there are common challenges facing Syrian and Iraqi society, and especially the terrorists of IS. He said the officials had spoken in detail about the movements of ISIS, whether on the Syrian-Iraqi border, inside Syria or inside Iraq during the visit. Hussein referred to an operations room formed by Syria, Iraq, Turkey, Jordan and Lebanon at a recent meeting in Amman to confront IS, and said it would soon begin work. The relationship between Iraq and Syria is somewhat fraught after the fall of former Syrian President Bashar Assad. Al-Sudani came to power with the support of a coalition of Iran-backed factions, and Tehran was a major backer of Assad. The current interim president of Syria, Ahmad al-Sharaa, was previously known as Abu Mohammed al-Golani and fought as an al-Qaida militant in Iraq after the U.S. invasion of 2003, and later fought against Assads government in Syria. But Syrian interim Foreign Minister Asaad Hassan al-Shibani focused on the historic ties between the two countries. Throughout history, Baghdad and Damascus have been the capitals of the Arab and Islamic world, sharing knowledge, culture and economy, he said. Strengthening the partnership between the two countries will not only benefit our peoples, but will also contribute to the stability of the region, making us less dependent on external powers and better able to determine our own destiny, he said. The operation and the visit come at a time when Iraqi officials are anxious about an IS resurgence in the wake of the fall of Assad in Syria. While Syrias new rulers - led by the Islamist former insurgent group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham - have pursued IS cells since taking power, some fear a breakdown in overall security that could allow the group to stage a resurgence. The U.S. and Iraq announced an agreement last year to wind down the military mission in Iraq of an American-led coalition fighting the Islamic State group by September 2025, with U.S. forces departing some bases where they have stationed troops during a two-decade-long military presence in the country. When the agreement was reached to end the coalitions mission in Iraq, Iraqi political leaders said the threat of IS was under control and they no longer needed Washingtons help to beat back the remaining cells. But the fall of Assad in December led some to reassess that stance, including members of the Coordination Framework, a coalition of mainly Shiite, Iran-allied political parties that brought current Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammad Shia al-Sudani to power in late 2022.

        "date": "March 15, 2025 03:22 pm",
        "content": "The Trump administration is considering issuing sweeping travel restrictions for the citizens of dozens of countries as part of a new ban, according to sources familiar with the matter and an internal memo seen by Reuters. The memo lists a total of 41 countries divided into three separate groups. The first group of 10 countries, including Afghanistan, Iran, Syria, Cuba and North Korea among others, would be set for a full visa suspension. In the second group, five countries -- Eritrea, Haiti, Laos, Myanmar and South Sudan -- would face partial suspensions that would impact tourist and student visas as well as other immigrant visas, with some exceptions. In the third group, a total of 26 countries that includes Belarus, Pakistan and Turkmenistan among others would be considered for a partial suspension of U.S. visa issuance if their governments do not make efforts to address deficiencies within 60 days, the memo said. A U.S. official speaking on the condition of anonymity cautioned there could be changes on the list and that it was yet to be approved by the administration, including U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio. The New York Times first reported on the list of countries. The move harkens back to President Donald Trumps first term ban on travelers from seven majority-Muslim nations, a policy that went through several iterations before it was upheld by the Supreme Court in 2018. Trump issued an executive order on January 20 requiring intensified security vetting of any foreigners seeking admission to the U.S. to detect national security threats. That order directed several cabinet members to submit by March 21 a list of countries from which travel should be partly or fully suspended because their vetting and screening information is so deficient. Trumps directive is part of an immigration crackdown that he launched at the start of his second term. He previewed his plan in an October 2023 speech, pledging to restrict people from the Gaza Strip, Libya, Somalia, Syria, Yemen and anywhere else that threatens our security.

The shooting had occurred at around 6:45 p.m. near a Buddha Shrine (Budu Madura) at Idamthota in Ambalangoda, when two unidentified individuals who arrived on a motorcycle opened fire. The victim, Krishantha Mendis, also known as Podi Sudda, was killed in the shooting. According to police, the 45-year-old victim was a father of four and worked as a hired laborer in the area. Authorities confirmed that he had no criminal record and was known to have lived in the area peacefully. However, investigators suspect that the murder was orchestrated by the gang of Saman Priyantha, alias Saman Kolla, on the belief that the victim was providing information to the police regarding illegal activities in the area, police said. Reports indicate that the victim had previously been assaulted by two members of Saman Kollas gang in January. Police also recalled a similar incident on December 5, 2016, when a father, mother, and their four-year-old child were shot dead in the same Idamthota areaalso allegedly by Saman Kollas gang membersunder suspicion of being police informants.",

Referring to former President Ranil Wickremesinghes recent Al Jazeera interview, the Batticaloa District MP said he does not understand why the ex-president is defending the previous government. He charged that former President Ranil Wickremesinghe, who sat in the opposition at the time, who seemed to be a champion of human rights, has gone on Al Jazeera and defended the government he himself was opposed to. This is precisely the problem in this country. The state will always protect itself. And now this government is no different. This government is also trying to protect itself, the state, he said. President Ranil Wickremesinghe, who wasnt even responsible for the attack, is going on Al Jazeera and defending the person who is accused of it. This is the problem in this country. The state will always defend itself. He added that incumbent foreign minister Vijitha Herath and his government are no different. The entire Northern Province voted for you. This is how you repay their faith they put in the government. Shame on this government. Rasamanickam charged that the foreign minister spoke only about domestic mechanisms on accountability that were already in place, during his speech at the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva. The Tamil people have rejected any domestic mechanism because 16 years later there has not been a single case that you have solved. Referring to the Batalanda Commission report which was recently tabled in Parliament, the MP said: The problem is, all these reports that are generally tabled, we never see any action. The Paranagama commission report was tabled. The Udalagama commission report was tabled. What action has the previous government taken? This government has also had enough of time. The President has been the President for 6 months. If his position was to take action on these things, if it was to investigate, he would have started it by now. Nothing. So, again what we are going to see is that Tamil people will be denied justice in this country. If the former President is defending his nemesis on foreign media, what faith can we have in this particular government? he questioned.",

        "content": "The U.S. is expelling South Africas ambassador, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said, calling the envoy a race-baiting politician who hates President Donald Trump. Ties have slumped since Trump cut U.S. financial aid to South Africa, citing disapproval of its land policy and its genocide case against Washingtons ally Israel at the International Court of Justice. South Africas Ambassador to the United States is no longer welcome in our great country, Rubio said on Friday in a post on X about the rare barring of a nations top diplomat. Ebrahim Rasool is a race-baiting politician who hates America and hates Donald Trump. In statements from its presidency and international relations department, South Africa called the move regrettable but said it remained committed to building mutually beneficial relations and would address the matter via diplomatic channels. Rubio reposted an article from right-wing website Breitbart that quoted the envoy as saying that Trump was leading a white supremacist movement. He must depart by March 21, a State Department spokesperson said on Saturday. Reuters was unable to contact Rasool or confirm his whereabouts. News website Semafor reported this week that Rasool has failed to secure routine meetings with State Department officials and key Republican party figures since Trump, a Republican, took office in January, The U.S. is reviewing its South Africa policy, the State Department spokesperson added, citing the land policy, South Africas growing ties with countries like Russia and Iran and aggressive positions toward the U.S. and allies. Ties at Lowest Point The US  South Africa relationship has now reached its lowest point, said Patrick Gaspard, a former U.S. ambassador to South Africa. Theres too much at stake to not work towards the repair of this partnership. Rasool presented his credentials to then-President Joe Biden on January 13, a week before Trump took office, according to the embassys website, for a second stint in Washington. Trump has said, without citing evidence, that South Africa is confiscating land and that certain classes of people are being treated very badly. South African-born billionaire Elon Musk, who is close to Trump, has said white South Africans have been the victims of racist ownership laws. South African President Cyril Ramaphosa signed into law a bill in January aimed at making it easier for the state to expropriate land in the public interest, in some cases without compensating the owner. Ramaphosa has defended the policy as evening out racial disparities in ownership in the Black-majority nation and said the government had not confiscated any land. Trump has offered to resettle white South African farmers and their families as refugees. The State Department is coordinating with the Department of Homeland Security and has begun implementing the plan, the State Department spokesperson said, adding that initial interviews were underway.

        "title": "Trump orders strikes on Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen and issues new warning",
        "date": "March 16, 2025 07:39 am",
        "content": "President Donald Trump said he ordered a series of airstrikes on the Houthi-held areas in Yemen on Saturday, promising to use overwhelming lethal force until Iranian-backed Houthi rebels cease their attacks on shipping along a vital maritime corridor. The Houthis said at least 18 civilians were killed. Our brave Warfighters are right now carrying out aerial attacks on the terrorists bases, leaders, and missile defenses to protect American shipping, air, and naval assets, and to restore Navigational Freedom, Trump said in a social media post. No terrorist force will stop American commercial and naval vessels from freely sailing the Waterways of the World. He also warned Iran to stop supporting the rebel group, promising to hold the country fully accountable for the actions of its proxy. It comes two weeks after the U.S. leader sent a letter to Iranian leaders offering a path to restarting bilateral talks between the countries on Irans advancing nuclear weapons program. Trump has said he will not allow it to become operational. The Houthis reported explosions in their territory Saturday evening, in the capital of Sanaa and the northern province of Saada, the rebels stronghold on the border with Saudi Arabia, with more airstrikes reported in those areas early Sunday. Images online showed plumes of black smoke over the area of the Sanaa airport complex, which includes a sprawling military facility. The Houthis also reported airstrikes early Sunday on the provinces of Hodeida, Bayda, and Marib. At least 18 people were killed, including 13 in Sanaa and five in Saada, according to the Houthi-run health ministry. At least 24 others were wounded, including nine in Sanaa and 15 in Saada, it said. A U.S. official said this was the beginning of air strikes on Houthi targets that are expected to continue. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk to the press. Nasruddin Amer, deputy head of the Houthi media office, said the airstrikes wont deter them and they would retaliate against the U.S. Sanaa will remain Gazas shield and support and will not abandon it no matter the challenges, he added on social media. Another spokesman, Mohamed Abdulsalam, on X, called Trumps claims that the Houthis threaten international shipping routes false and misleading. The airstrikes come a few days after the Houthis said they would resume attacks on Israeli vessels sailing off Yemen in response to Israels latest blockade on Gaza. They described the warning as affecting the Red Sea, the Gulf of Aden, the Bab el-Mandeb Strait and the Arabian Sea. There have been no Houthi attacks reported since then. Earlier this month, Israel halted all aid coming into Gaza and warned of additional consequences for Hamas if their fragile ceasefire in the war isnt extended as negotiations continue over starting a second phase. The Houthis had targeted over 100 merchant vessels with missiles and drones, sinking two vessels and killing four sailors, during their campaign targeting military and civilian ships between the start of the war between Israel and Hamas in late 2023 and January of this year, when this ceasefire in Gaza took effect. The attacks raised the Houthis profile as they faced economic and other problems at home amid Yemens decade-long stalemated war thats torn apart the Arab worlds poorest nation. The Houthi media office said the U.S. strikes hit a residential neighborhood in Sanaas northern district of Shouab. Residents said at least four airstrikes rocked the Eastern Geraf neighborhood there, terrifying women and children. The explosions were very strong, said Abdallah al-Alffi. It was like an earthquake. The Eastern Geraf is home to Houthi-held military facilities and a headquarters for the rebels political bureau, located in a densely populated area. The Houthis reported fresh strikes on the southwestern Dhamar province late Saturday. They said the strikes hit the outskirts of the provincial capital, also named Dhamar, and the district of Abs. The United States, Israel and Britain have previously hit Houthi-held areas in Yemen. Israels military declined to comment. However, Saturdays operation was conducted solely by the U.S., according to a U.S. official. It was the first strike on the Yemen-based Houthis under the second Trump administration. Such broad-based missile strikes against the Houthis were carried out multiple times by the Biden administration in response to frequent attacks by the Houthis against commercial and military vessels in the region. The USS Harry S. Truman carrier strike group, which includes the carrier, three Navy destroyers and one cruiser, are in the Red Sea and were part of Saturdays mission. The USS Georgia cruise missile submarine has also been operating in the region. Trump announced the strikes as he spent the day at his Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach, Florida. These relentless assaults have cost the U.S. and World Economy many BILLIONS of Dollars while, at the same time, putting innocent lives at risk, Trump said. Source: AP --Agencies",

He announced the arrest of a man earlier and state news agency Mia said the club owner was detained. Toskovski has also said that, according to initial reports, the fire had been started by sparks from pyrotechnic devices that had hit the ceiling, which was made of highly flammable material. Footage shows the band playing on stage when two flares go off, sparks then catch fire on the ceiling before rapidly spreading. Video verified by the BBC shows people trying to extinguish the flames on the ceiling. It shows the club was still full and people appeared to be watching efforts to put out the fire, rather than leaving. Marija Taseva, 20, told Channel 5 TV she was caught in a crush at the club as people rushed for the exits. She said she fell to the ground and was trampled in the chaos before managing to get out. Her family were still searching for her 25-year-old sister, though, who had not been found in any local hospital - and may have been transferred to Skopje for treatment. The interior minister had earlier announced a death toll of 51 - with some 100 injured. In his update, he said 35 of the deceased had already been identified. Kocanis hospital director said earlier that staff had been struggling to identify patients due to a lack of ID cards. However she went on to say that those deceased were aged between of 14 and 24. Eighteen patients are said to be in critical condition. In a statement, the prime minister said the government was fully mobilised and will do everything necessary to deal with the consequences and determine the causes of this tragedy. DNK was formed in 2002 and has topped the charts over the past decade. Source: BBC --Agencies",

        "content": "Sri Lanka has expressed its willingness to invest in joint ventures in Bangladesh, particularly in synthetic fabric manufacturing, which holds significant potential for investors from both nations, Sri Lankan High Commissioner to Bangladesh Dharmapala Weerakkody said today. He made these remarks during a courtesy call on Taskeen Ahmed, president of the Dhaka Chamber of Commerce  Industry (DCCI), at the chambers office in the capital, according to a press release. Weerakkody highlighted several sectors as highly promising for joint venture investments, including healthcare, tourism, large hotels, information technology, education, and pharmaceuticals. He pointed out that both Bangladesh and Sri Lanka are members of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation and have maintained a strong and friendly bilateral diplomatic relationship for many years. He urged Bangladeshi entrepreneurs to leverage Sri Lankas experience and technical expertise to develop the countrys local tourism sector. The high commissioner also said that Sri Lanka has already signed preferential trade agreements (PTAs) with several countries, and negotiations with Bangladesh are set to begin soon to further expand bilateral trade and investment. During the meeting, DCCI President Taskeen Ahmed stated that bilateral trade between Bangladesh and Sri Lanka reached 134.06 million in the fiscal year (FY) 2023-24. This marked a significant increase from the 93.11 million recorded in FY 2019-20, reflecting a notable annual growth rate of 9.5 percent, he said. Taskeen added that a substantial number of Sri Lankan investors, particularly from the banking, textile, power, construction, and pharmaceutical sectors, have already made foreign direct investments of 428.56 million in Bangladesh. He also encouraged Sri Lankan entrepreneurs to consider investing further in agriculture and food processing, the construction industry, healthcare, tourism, IT, and fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG). Taskeen Ahmed emphasised Sri Lankas expertise and technical assistance in areas such as deep-sea fishing, tourism, and the shipping industry. He also proposed that negotiations at the government level be expanded to facilitate the early signing of the proposed PTA, which would significantly enhance bilateral trade and investment. Among others, Razeev H Chowdhury, senior vice-president of the DCCI, Md Salem Sulaiman, vice-president, and Srimali Jayarathne, counsellor (commercial) at the Sri Lankan High Commission in Bangladesh, were also present.

        "date": "March 16, 2025 09:57 pm",
        "content": "The Sri Lankan Energy Ministry had reached out to the local arm of Adani Green Energy Ltd to find out the reason behind their proposed exit. Adanis haved replied to our letter withing two weeks. The project is still alive, a senior official with the Sri Lankan government said when asked now that Gautum Adani led entity has expressed its desire to exit the project, whether the project will be offered to other players. Also, the Ministry of Energy is waiting for the Court decisions and AGs clearance for starting the negotiations. Until we get the court clearence we cannot take any decision, the official told businessline. Though Adanis in their letter have reiterated what they had communicated earlier to Sri Lankas Board of Investment about their intent to exit the project, they however stated that they were open to discussions. The main contention has been the tariff. There was also a buzz that during the likely visit of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to Sri Lanka next month, this issue may be taken up as it was a government to government deal, but multiple sources both in India and Sri Lanka have said that it is not on agenda. Meanwhile, on March 14 Minister of Power and Energy of Sri Lanka, Kumara Jayakodi, was quoted as informing the Sri Lankan Parliament that the contract for the wind power project in Mannar will be given to another company if the Adani group is not interested. We are awaiting a final response from the local agent for Adani. The contract for the project will be awarded to another company if Adani decides to withdraw from it, the Minister was quoted as saying. Sources tracking the development in Sri Lanka said that informally the Sri Lankan Energy Ministry has reached out to other investors. What will be decided is whether this time again it will be a government to goverment deal or bids will be called, an observer said. The Sri Lankan government is now indicating that all future RE projects, including roof top solar, would be contracted following competitive tenders, a source said. The issue with Adani is tariff. Recently the new Cabinet of Sri Lanka has given its nod to constitute a committee that will take up the contentious issue of tariff. The tariff which Sri Lanka was looking at was around 6 cents a unit, while the offer from Adanis were around 8 cents a unit. The first letter from Adani Green addressed to Arjuna Herath Chairman Board of Investment Colombo, Sri Lanka, which created uncertainty on the future of the projects was sent in February. The second letter to the Energy Ministry has been sent recently on queries being raised by the government their. The letter has said that Adani Green has been under protracted discussions with Ceylon Electricity Board and various Government departments since past more than two years, in respect of establishing 484 MW Renewable Energy Wind Farms at Mannar and Pooneryn, Sri Lanka, along with its associated Transmission system, as also additional 220 KV and 400 KV Transmission network expansion to carry electrons to consumptive centers in the southern part of Sri Lanka. In its February letter, Adani Green, had said that With the exception of Mannar Environmental approval and an associated Supreme Court case, we have procured almost all clearances. Similarly, we have worked on lands for the project, as well as associated transmission system. Till date, the company has spent about  5 million on the pre-development activities.

        "date": "March 17, 2025 08:41 am",
        "content": "US President Donald Trump has signed an order to strip back federally funded news organisation Voice of America, accusing it of being anti-Trump and radical. A White House statement said the order would ensure taxpayers are no longer on the hook for radical propaganda, and included quotes from politicians and right-wing media criticising the broadcaster. VOA, still primarily a radio service, was set up during World War Two to counter Nazi propaganda. It says it currently reaches hundreds of millions of people globally each week. Mike Abramowitz, VOAs director, said he and virtually his entire staff of 1,300 people had been put on paid leave. Abramowitz said that the order left VOA unable to carry out its vital mission... especially critical today, when Americas adversaries, like Iran, China, and Russia, are sinking billions of dollars into creating false narratives to discredit the United States. The National Press Club, a leading representative group for US journalists, said the order undermines Americas long-standing commitment to a free and independent press. It added: If an entire newsroom can be sidelined overnight, what does that say about the state of press freedom? An entire institution is being dismantled piece by piece. This isnt just a staffing decision - its a fundamental shift that endangers the future of independent journalism at VOA. The presidents order targets VOAs parent company US Agency for Global Media (USAGM), which also funds non-profit entities such as Radio Free Europe and Radio Free Asia, which were originally set up to counter communism. It tells managers to reduce performance to the minimum presence and function required by law. CBS, the BBCs US news partner, said that VOA employees were notified in an email by Crystal Thomas, the USAGM human resources director. A source told CBS that all freelance workers and international contractors were told there was now no money to pay them. Emails obtained by CBS notified the bosses of Radio Free Asia and Radio Free EuropeRadio Liberty that their federal grants had been terminated. VOA and other stations under USAGM say they serve more than 400 million listeners. They are broadly equivalent to the BBC World Service, which is part-funded by the British government. The Czech Republics Foreign Minister, Jan Lipavský, said he hoped the European Union could help keep Radio Free EuropeRadio Liberty running in Prague. He said he would ask European foreign ministers at a meeting on Monday to find ways to at least partially maintain the broadcasters operations. Elon Musk, the billionaire and top adviser to Trump who has been overseeing sweeping cuts to the US government, has used his social media platform X to call for VOA to be shut down. The US president also cut funding to several other federal agencies - including those responsible for preventing homelessness, and funding museums and libraries. Trump was highly critical of VOA in his first term. He has recently appointed staunch loyalist Kari Lake to be a special adviser for the USAGM. The president regularly states that mainstream media outlets are biased against him. He called CNN and MSNBC corrupt during a speech at the justice department. Voice of America launched in 1942 with a mandate to combat Nazi and Japanese propaganda. Its first broadcast - made on a transmitter loaned to the US by the BBC - stated a modest purpose. Gerald Ford, a former president, signed VOAs public charter in 1976 to safeguard its editorial independence. By 1994, the Broadcast Board of Governors, with oversight over non-military broadcasting, was established. In 2013, a shift in legislation allowed VOA and affiliates to begin broadcasting in the US.

        "date": "March 17, 2025 09:11 am",
        "content": "Prime Minister Dr. Harini Amarasuriya stated that the project to distribute smart boards for 1,000 schools with the goal of enhancing education has completely failed to meet its objectives and the investment of LKR 1.7 billion has been underutilized. The Minister of Education, Higher Education and Vocational Education, Prime Minister Dr. Harini Amarasuriya made these remarks in the Parliament complex while discussing the project to establish networked classrooms by facilitating smart boards to the school system, according to the Prime Ministers Media Division. The Cabinet Memorandum No. AMP240385601027 and the Cabinet decision dated March 4, 2024 has been presented for the approval of the provision of digital smart boards and other related equipment to 1,000 selected schools, with the objective of enhancing education through the establishment of a systematic network of smart classrooms within the school system funded by the Sri Lanka Telecommunications Regulatory Commission (TRCSL). Subsequently, an additional Cabinet Memorandum, No. AMP240978630009, dated May 14, 2024, was presented, proposing the implementation of this project in alignment with the project proposed by Chinese government for digitalizing Schools. Under this Chinese-funded project, plans were made to establish a centralized control center and a studio facility, along with the provision of an additional 500 smart boards. Accordingly, the integration of both projects was proposed to create a network of smart classrooms across 1,500 schools. The cabinet decision has been presented requiring Sri Lankan Government to purchase smart boards with specifications identical to the smart boards which were proposed to be distributed by the Chinese Government, the statement said. In line with the Cabinet decision of May 14, 2024, the procurement for the 1,000 smart boards began in July 2024. However, at the time of purchase, the project proposed by the Chinese Government was still at the discussion stage, and no official agreement had been reached regarding the technical specifications of the smart boards. However, the procurement was carried out through the Sri Lanka State Trading (General) Corporation without a competitive bidding process, relying on price quotations obtained from a single supplier based on unclear sources that were not officially verified by the Chinese government. The Sri Lanka Telecommunications Regulatory Commission incurred the full cost of LKR 1.7 billion, with an additional LKR 430 million allocated for services and installation, it said. The aforementioned procurement appears to have been conducted at an unusually accelerated pace when compared to the standard procedure typically followed for high-value procurements. Specifically, price quotations were requested on July 5, 2024, opened on July 15, 2024, and by July 16, 2024, the Technical Evaluation Committee had completed and submitted the report. Subsequently, the report was reviewed by the Standing Procurement Committee appointed by the Cabinet on July 17 and 18, 2024, with recommendations being provided on the same day. These recommendations were then submitted to the Cabinet on July 23, 2024, and approval was granted on July 30, 2024. Followed by this, the purchase requisition was issued to the supplier on August 5, 2024. Accordingly, the entire procurement process was completed within a span of one month. As part of this procurement, a Letter of Credit was opened to facilitate the payment of USD 3,135,392.50 for 1,000 smart boards to Intelligent Express Limited Hong Kong, which has been identified as a representative of Huawei. While the relevant Cabinet paper indicated Huawei as the designated manufacturer supplying the smart boards under the Chinese funding project, the Chinese government has not yet confirmed the selection of such a supplier for this project, the statement highlighted. According to aforementioned purchase requisition, the purchased smart boards and related equipment were delivered to the Ministry of Education in October 2024 and are currently stored at Pattala Gedara Teachers Training College. Although the procurement of the aforementioned Smart boards by the Sri Lankan Government has been finalized, the relevant project, which was intended to be implemented under the funding of Chinese government, has not yet commenced and a final agreement regarding its implementation has not been reached. Prior to reaching a final agreement on the network integration facilities and centralized system proposed by the Chinese government, the procurement of these smart boards has resulted in the inability to utilize the equipment for the intended purpose. It is expected that the Chinese aid project is at the discussion stage, and the implementation may extend until the end of this year. Further, no official decision has been made regarding the selection of a supplier for the project. Given this situation, if the 1,000 smart boards and other equipment currently stored in warehouses are to be distributed to schools, school principals must be provided with clear instructions on their proper use. However, due to the delay in implementing the project under the funding of the Chinese government, specific guidelines on the installation and utilization of the equipment cannot yet be issued, the statement added. Since network integration cannot be carried out at this stage, these smart boards can only be used as standalone classroom units. As a result, the objectives of the project will not be met, and the investment of LKR 1.7 billion made might be considered to be underutilized. A formal investigation has been initiated to determine whether financial and procedural irregularities have occurred in this procurement. Additionally, discussions are currently continued with the Chinese government, and efforts are being made to secure the proposed facilities from China at the earliest convenience.",

        "content": "The Court of Appeal has dismissed the writ petition filed by former Inspector General of Police (IGP) Deshabandu Tennakoon, seeking an interim injunction to prevent the execution of the arrest order issued by the Matara Magistrates Court against him in connection with the shooting incident that took place in Weligama, Matara, in 2023. Subsequently, the Appeals Court has ordered the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) to take immediate steps to arrest Deshabandu Tennakoon and present him before the court. The Court of Appeal bench, comprising Acting President of the Court of Appeal Mohamed Lafar Tahir and Justice Sarath Dissanayake, announced the verdict this morning (17), stating that the relevant petition will be dismissed without a hearing. The petition filed by Tennakoon before the Court of Appeal, seeking an order to prevent his arrest, was taken up for consideration on March 12. His legal representatives had requested an interim injunction to stay the arrest warrant issued by the Matara Magistrates Court. Meanwhile, this morning, Tennakoons legal representative has submitted a motion to the Court of Appeal in relation to the petition. The motion requests permission to submit additional documents related to the case. The motion was filed ahead of the appeal decision regarding Deshabandus writ petition. Additionally, an agreement has been reached between the Attorney General (AG) and the legal counsel of the suspects implicated in the 2023 shooting incident near a hotel in Weligama. In this regard, the AG issued a special notice yesterday (16) regarding the order to arrest former IGP Deshabandu Tennakoon and six other suspects in connection with the incident. As per the agreement, the AG has directed the CID not to arrest the Officer-in-Charge (OIC) of the Colombo Crimes Division (CCD) and five other accused individuals, excluding former IGP Deshabandu Tennakoon, who is wanted in connection with the incident and is currently absconding. The Matara Magistrates Court had ordered the arrest of eight former officers of the Colombo Crimes Division (CCD), including former IGP Deshabandu Tennakoon, and named them as suspects in the shooting incident that occurred in front of the W15 Hotel in the Pelena area of Weligama, Matara, on December 31, 2023.

        "date": "March 17, 2025 03:21 pm",
        "content": "OpenAI and Elon Musk have agreed to fast-track a trial over OpenAIs for-profit shift, the latest turn in a grudge match between the worlds richest person and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman playing out publicly in court. Billionaire Elon Musk and OpenAI jointly proposed a trial in December, according to a federal court filing on Friday. The parties agreed to delay a decision on whether the expedited case will be decided by a jury or solely by the judge, said the filing in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. The judge this month denied Musks request to pause the artificial intelligence groups transition to a for-profit model but agreed to an expedited trial in the autumn, the latest turn in the high-stakes legal fight. We welcome the courts March 4 decision rejecting, Elon Musks latest attempt to slow down OpenAI for his personal benefit, OpenAI said in a blog post on Friday. Musk cofounded OpenAI with Altman in 2015 but left before the company took off and subsequently founded the competing startup xAI in 2023. Last year, the CEO of Tesla and owner of the X social media platform sued OpenAi and Altman, accusing OpenAI of straying from its founding mission  to develop AI for the good of humanity, not corporate profit. OpenAI and Altman have denied the allegations, while Altman alleges that Musk has been trying to slow down a competitor. At stake in the lawsuit is the ChatGPT makers transition to a for-profit model, which the startup says is crucial to raising more capital and competing well in the expensive AI race. OpenAIs last fundraising round, of 6.6 billion, and a new round of up to 40 billion under discussion with SoftBank Group, are conditioned on OpenAI restructuring to remove the nonprofits control. Fridays filing comes weeks after Altman, who has said OpenAI is not for sale, rejected a 97.4 billion unsolicited takeover bid from a Musk-led consortium with a no thank you.

        "date": "March 17, 2025 03:50 pm",
        "content": "Brands including Prada have cut ties with South Korean actor Kim Soo-hyun amid controversy over his relationship with actress Kim Sae-ron who was found dead in February. The 37-year-old actor who gained popularity in South Korea and China over his role in hit South Korean drama series My Love from the Star and Queen of Tears has been accused of dating Kim Sae-ron when she was underage in a YouTube expose, citing testimonies from the actress relatives. Luxury fashion group Prada said it mutually decided to end its collaboration with Kim when asked in a client service chat on Monday. It did not elaborate further. Dinto, a South Korean cosmetic brand, also announced it was ending its advertising contract with Kim. We have determined that there are substantial grounds rendering the fulfilment of the advertising contract unfeasible, the company said in a statement on Saturday. Kim Soo-hyuns agency Goldmedalist referred to a statement given on Friday, when it denied claims that the two were in a relationship dating back to 2015 when Kim Sae-ron was a minor. She was also managed by the agency, but her contract was not renewed in 2022; the same year that she was involved in a drunk driving incident. Goldmedalist also said Kim Soo-hyun, who has not commented directly, had been unfairly linked to Kim Sae-rons death. Kim, who was 24 years old, was found dead at her home. Her career had suffered since the drunk driving incident, and local media reported that she was in debt and working part-time jobs to pay it off. Goldmedalist said the actress owed the company around 0.7 billion won (483,759.50) in damages and penalties as a result of the drunk driving case. In 2024, Kim Sae-ron posted a photo of her with Kim Soo-hyun which was quickly deleted, prompting speculation that the two were a couple. A lawyer representing the relatives of Kim Sae-ron said in a media briefing on Monday that the late actress had decided to post the photo in hopes of hearing back from Kim Soo-hyun.

        "content": "Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said U.S. President Donald Trump was far more prepared for his second term, furnished with a clear roadmap, speaking in a podcast interview weeks ahead of reciprocal tariffs planned by Washington. India is among the trading partners set to face the tariffs from April, which threaten to cause distress to its exporters in industries from automobiles to agriculture. After Modi and Trump met last month, the two nations agreed to resolve tariff rows and work on the first segment of a deal by the fall of 2025, aiming to reach two-way trade of 500 billion by 2030. This time, he seems far more prepared than before, Modi said in a podcast with American computer scientist and podcaster Lex Fridman released on Sunday, referring to Trumps second term, which began in January. He has a clear roadmap in his mind with well-defined steps, each one designed to lead him toward his goals, he added. During the discussion, which ran more than three hours, Modi spoke on issues from diplomacy and artificial intelligence to his early life, in a conversation Fridman called one of the most powerful of his life. Modi praised Trump for his graciousness and humility, underscoring a strong bond between the leaders. His (Trumps) reflection showed his America First spirit, just as I believe in nation first. I stand for India first, and thats why we connect so well, Modi said. INDIAS NEIGHBOURS Indias relations with neighbour China improved last year after striking a milestone pact to lower military tension on their Himalayan border following talks between Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping in Russia. Slowly but surely, trust, enthusiasm, and energy will return, Modi said during the podcast, as the two countries work to restore relations to their state before a military border skirmish in 2020. But of course, it will take some time, since theres been a five-year gap, he said, adding that the focus of the two nations was to ensure their differences do not turn into disputes. On ties with archfoe Pakistan, Modi expressed hope for peaceful relations. Every noble attempt at fostering peace was met with hostility and betrayal, he said, adding, we sincerely hope that wisdom prevails upon them and they choose the path of peace.

Britain and France have spearheaded efforts to offer a peacekeeping plan for Ukraine after U.S. President Donald Trump began talks to press for a peace deal with Russia.

Starmer hosted a virtual meeting on Saturday with leaders from Europe and other countries to build support for the coalition before military planners are due to meet in Britain on Thursday to discuss how a truce could be guaranteed.
