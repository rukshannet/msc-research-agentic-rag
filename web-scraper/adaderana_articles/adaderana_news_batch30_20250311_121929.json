        "date": "February 27, 2025 07:28 pm",
        "content": "Sri Lanka vowed on Thursday (Feb 27) to urgently tackle costly clashes between villagers and wild elephants after reporting the deaths of nearly 1,200 people and over 3,500 animals in a decade. Environment minister Dammika Patabendi told parliament that they will build more electrified fences and deploy additional staff to help reduce elephant raids on villages near wildlife sanctuaries. We are allocating more money to reduce the human-elephant conflict, and are hopeful that within a short period of time we will be able to mitigate the situation, Patabendi said. Between 2015 and 2024, 1,195 people and 3,484 wild elephants were killed, he said. In January this year, three more people and 43 elephants were killed. Opposition legislator Nalin Bandara said the toll was shocking and urged authorities to protect people, while also ensuring that the wild animals were not harmed. He noted that disposing of the carcasses of wild elephants had cost the state about US11.6 million over a decade, while compensation to victims of elephant attacks was about US4 million over the same period. Killing or harming elephants is a criminal offence in Sri Lanka, which has an estimated 7,000 wild elephants, which are considered a national treasure, partly due to their significance in Buddhist culture. However, the massacre continues as desperate farmers struggle with elephants raiding their crops and destroying livelihoods. Many elephants have been electrocuted, shot and poisoned. Sometimes explosives-packed fruits are used to injure the animals, often ending in painful deaths. Elephants are also killed by trains running through their habitats. Seven elephants, including four calves, were killed when they were run over by an express train in the islands eastern Habarana region a week ago. It was the worst such accident recorded in the country. Asian elephants are recognised as endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. An estimated 26,000 of them live in the wild, mostly in India, surviving for an average of 60 years to 70 years outside captivity. Source: AFP --Agencies",

Speaking on the issue, Wickremesinghe pointed out the contrasting approaches taken by the UN, particularly in light of the ongoing war between Ukraine and Russia. Mr. Wickremesinghe noted that while the United States is pushing to end the war in Ukraine, with Russia making significant sacrifices to achieve its goals, many European nations have remained silent on key issues surrounding Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. This includes a failure to hold a presidential election in Ukraine, which he described as a violation of democratic processes. In comparison, Wickremesinghe highlighted that Sri Lanka has conducted elections on time, emphasizing the contrast in how the UN treats the two nations. He expressed concern that Sri Lanka is being treated differently and pointed out the two-pronged approach of the UN Human Rights Office. The former president urged the current government and all political parties to take this situation seriously, especially with the UN Human Rights Office planning to bring forward a resolution regarding Sri Lanka in September this year. The comments come at a time when global politics are shifting, particularly as the international community seeks to bring an end to the war in Ukraine. Wickremesinghes remarks call for a more consistent and fair approach to human rights and political accountability on the global stage. --Agencies",

        "content": "The government is discussing with several local and foreign parties to conceptualize a government sovereign cloud and intends to engage with qualified players and have a mechanism for all of them to participate in setting it up, top officials said. Sri Lanka is in the midst of establishing a national digital ID, and maintaining the sovereignty and security of the sensitive data involved has been an often-repeated concern. We need a sovereign cloud for the country which can meet all local and international security standards. We are currently in discussions with potential parties, to establish a mechanism for all qualified local and international players to participate in the cloud setup process, Sanjaya Karunasena, director of the Information Communication Technology Agency of Sri Lanka (ICTA) told Biometric Update on Wednesday. The government must ensure data security by rigorously testing and securing citizen data, as well as providing service warranties, to protect personal information, he explained further. He said biometric-backed digital identity would provide a highly reliable, robust identity system in cyberspace for the Sri Lankan people. He mentioned the need for numerous gates and security testing of the system before it can be made available for public use. The plan for a national data exchange, which would work with Sri Lankas cloud, was detailed earlier in February. Addressing the issue of security, Dr. Hans Wijesuriya, chief adviser to the President on Digital Economy and secretary to the Ministry of Digital Economy noted that, fundamental security and control assemblies come first and that this can be subject to a proportionate assessment of risk and granular data in use. Different types of data need different treatments in terms of risk mitigation. So, there are many layers which lend themselves to integration and the extension of horizontal layers. We should look at multiple dimensions for citizen-centric services without compromising national security. Also, we will look at businesses in a cross-border angle and in an inclusion angle, where business-to-business (B2B) interfaces can especially boost trade volumes and transactions in the region, he said at the Innovation Island Summit in Colombo recently.

        "date": "February 28, 2025 07:55 am",
        "content": "Visiting Senior Fellow at ODI Global in the United Kingdom and former Director of Research at the Asian Development Bank Institute in Tokyo, Dr. Ganeshan Wignaraja, says that despite the deflationary trend, Sri Lanka continues to face considerably high poverty levels that must be addressed. Joining Ada Deranas current affairs program Hydepark, he emphasized that to tackle poverty, Sri Lanka must focus on an economic growth plan that can leverage the necessary tools to address pressing issues. Commending the President for being pragmatic and continuing to implement essential reforms, Dr. Wignaraja stressed that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) program should be utilized to establish prudent macroeconomic stability in the country. Speaking further, Dr. Wignaraja said: The outlook for this this year in Sri Lanka is 5 growth according to what the Central Bank say. Inflation is now actually in deflation - meaning price rate growth is falling according to the numbers, but poverty remains very stubbornly high. 50 of Sri Lankans are said to be deprived by the UNDPs multi-dimensional poverty index. The World Bank estimates like quarter of our population is poor at the level of 365 a day. So the problem with this is that the household surveys are expensive and only come out in frequently. So, what what people do is they try to look at samples of population tell you a story and the story appears to be that the poverty numbers have remained stubbornly high at somewhere between 25 of the Sri Lankan population to 50. There may have been a little bit of trending downwards with growth recovering in the Sri Lankan economy but there are pockets of poverty. One big issue is old age poverty, he expressed. For instance you know we are an aging population in Sri Lanka and more than half our population will be over 60 years old very very soon and so this group are very poor particularly women who are vulnerable and they have an issue because we dont have proper pension system, our welfare support services and agencies dont adequately cover people. There are health issues and then there is this sad issue for me - child malnutrition. The sad part is we dont really have the resources to deal with all of this without proper growth. So were going to have to think of a growth plan for Sri Lanka at the next phase of our development, Dr. Wignaraja said. Commenting on 2025 Budget, Dr. Wignaraja stated that he does not think the this budget would really run down on the government coffers impacting growth trajectory for the country as the opposition suggests, and that the president deserves credit for being very pragmatic in what he has done. The president deserves credit for being very pragmatic in what he has done which is a continuity of policy broadly of Gotabaya Rajapaksa once he abandoned the homegrown solutions and went to the IMF of Ranil Wickremesinghe who helped bring around the turnaround during his time, but didnt reap the political dividend from that, Dr. Wignaraja highlighted. In the budget with really these three important pieces of legislation that are very much still in process and one encourages government to keep those pieces of legislation in place because you know the Indian example is the best uh case of this you know they went to the IMF many years ago and they have never gone since and thats a very good example so we must use the IMF program as a way of building prudent macroeconomic stability. The second thing of course is the digitization which I think is terribly important you know we really have to cut the inefficiency across public services and Public Service delivery and also the corruption incentives by digitization and I think thats very important, he added.",

        "title": "Grade 5 Scholarship Exam cut-off marks to be released soon - PM Harini",
        "date": "February 28, 2025 10:01 am",
        "content": "Prime Minister Dr. Harini Amarasuriya stated that immediate steps are being taken to release the cut-off marks for the 2024 Grade 5 Scholarship Examination, which faced disruptions due to the alleged leak of certain questions. Additionally, recommendations have been made to establish a resource pool and a question paper bank for examination boards to ensure the integrity and security of future examinations. The Prime Minister made these remarks in Parliament on yesterday (27), in response to a question raised by the opposition regarding the scholarship examination irregularities, according to the Prime Ministers Media Division. Addressing the matter further, Dr. Amarasuriya stated that an investigation conducted by the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) revealed that three conceptually similar questions from the first question paper of the recent examination were shared by a private tutor in the Kurunegala area through a social media group of the relevant tuition class before the examination. A panel of experts appointed by the Commissioner General of Examinations has ruled that the 13th respondent, found guilty in the case, must pay a fine of LKR 3 million, while the 6th and 9th respondents are required to pay LKR 2 million each as government fees, following one of the measures proposed by the respective committee. Based on the findings of the investigation conducted by the Department of Examinations, several measures have been recommended to prevent such incidents in the future, the statement said. These include conducting question paper preparation strictly within the Confidential Division of the Department of Examinations, ensuring that no confidential documents leave secure premises, implementing strict security checks for all individuals entering and exiting the Confidential Division, recruiting and training new members for examination boards to create a resource pool, and establishing a question paper bank to enhance examination security. Furthermore, disciplinary actions have been initiated against the Director of Planning at the National Institute of Education, who was found guilty in connection with the incident. Measures taken include immediate removal from question paper preparation, referring the case to the disciplinary authority for further inquiry, suspension without pay, conducting a formal inquiry under the coordination of the Department of Examinations, and presenting the individual before the Kaduwela Magistrates Court under CID jurisdiction. Additionally, the disciplinary authority has been notified to take necessary action against the primary school teacher and his spouse involved in the incident, ensuring that they do not work at the same institution while also imposing a permanent ban on them from all examination-related duties. The Giriwulla Zonal Education Office is conducting a preliminary investigation, and the teacher in question has already been suspended from duty. Meanwhile, the CID continues its investigations. Further action has been taken to impose a five-year ban on examination duties for a teacher from Kurunegala Maliyadeva Adarsha Vidyalaya, who was also a private tutor and had shared similar model questions in his WhatsApp group. The disciplinary authority has been informed to take necessary action against this individual. To prevent similar incidents in the future, enhanced security measures have been introduced within the Confidential Division of the Department of Examinations, it added. These measures include upgrading internal security camera systems for improved monitoring, developing a semi-automated system for question paper preparation to minimize human intervention, strengthening examination supervision with increased inspection rounds, restricting mobile phone usage inside examination halls, except for the chief invigilator, and deploying full-time external supervisors to uphold standards in examination centers. To ensure that no candidate is unfairly affected by this incident, it has been decided to grant full marks to all students for the three compromised questions in the scholarship examination. The evaluation of answer scripts had been temporarily halted due to multiple petitions filed in the Supreme Court by parents of affected students. However, following the Supreme Courts ruling on December 31, 2024, the evaluation process has resumed, and the cut-off marks will be released shortly.",

        "content": "Sri Lankas variety of attractions in a compact destination as well as a new casino set to open in Colombo mid-2025 will provide Indian travellers with more reasons to visit, say Indian tourism officials. According to Rajiv Mehra, president of the Indian Association of Tour Operators (IATO), Sri Lanka is a top choice for Indian travellers due to the destinations proximity, cultural ties, and diverse attractions. Mehra added that India has a strong market for gaming tourism, but travellers are limited by domestic options beyond Goa and Sikkim. As such, Sri Lanka, with its proximity and luxury offerings, presents a compelling alternative. India is Sri Lankas biggest source market, accounting for 416,974 visitors out of a total of two million arrivals in 2024, and is more than double of second-placed Russia, which accounted for 201,920 guests. Amitabh Kant, the man behind Indias highly successful nation branding campaigns, Incredible India and Kerala states Gods Own Country, recently told the media that Sri Lanka is a unique tourism product that has yet to be discovered by a vast majority of Indians. During his visit to Colombo last week, Kant urged Indian travellers to come and discover the rich heritage, culture and architecture of Sri Lanka. Kant, a retired Indian bureaucrat and the former chief executive officer of NITI Aayog, a public policy think tank of the government of India, noted that India has an outbound market of 20 million.

        "date": "February 28, 2025 03:49 pm",
        "content": "The Chairman of the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC), D.J. Rajakaruna, says that the 3 discount currently granted to fuel distributors will be abolished, with a new payment formula set to take effect from tomorrow (01). Addressing a press briefing today (28), the CPC Chairman claimed that the 3 discount, which has been in place since the circular issued on March 10, 2022, was unlawful. These people were entitled to a 3 discount. But it is implemented as per the circular issued on March 10, 2022. According to that, the current amount paid is unlawful. It is clearly stated that if the price of diesel increases beyond Rs. 121, then the corresponding 3 amount is paid. For petrol, it is Rs. 162. If so, those people should get 3.63 as a discount on a liter of petrol. Diesel should get 4.86, but if they calculate it at 3 last month, they will get Rs. 8.52, petrol 92 will get Rs. 9.14, and petrol 95 and super diesel will get even more, he explained. He further elaborated that due to system errors within the CPC, distributors had been receiving more than the intended amount. In 2022, the price of oil increased unusually. After that price increase, when calculated at 3, it went to Rs. 14-15. But according to the 2022 circular, those guys should only get 3 if the price of diesel increases by more than Rs. 121. That was a mistake made by the CPC. If our CPCs system had been fixed, they would not have received more than 3.63. Then those people went to court to continue this, and they got an injunction order, and because of that order, the 3 continued to increase. Later, that case was lost. When they tried to implement it again, they went to the Court of Appeal. They got an injunction order, and they got that amount of Rs. 14-15. Later, an audit was conducted in this regard. The audit also revealed that Rs. 35.4 billion had been illegally taken from the people at that time and the distributors had received this, and this needs to be corrected immediately, he said. To rectify the situation, CPC has developed a new formula that considers expenses such as electricity, water bills, and operational costs, offering profit shares accordingly. Now we have decided to remove this 3 and prepare an equation in relation to the expenses of these guys. We informed the Ministry Secretary about it. The secretary appointed a committee, and the decision taken by that committee is going to be implemented from tomorrow. He assured that the new system would be fair and transparent: In it, the electricity bill, water bill, and other expenses have been calculated, and an equation has been formulated to provide a fair profit share. That is what is going to be implemented. Now, if the electricity bill or water bill increases, the amount due will be received according to this equation. This is very fair, and there is no problem from the peoples point of view.",

        "date": "February 28, 2025 04:34 pm",
        "content": "U.S. Agency for International Development workers were allowed to briefly reenter the headquarters in Washington on Thursday to collect their personal belongings and clear out their desks, a day after President Donald Trumps administration said it was cutting more than 90 of the agencys aid contracts. Trump ordered a 90-day pause on all foreign aid in January to conduct a sweeping review to ensure that all the projects funded with U.S. taxpayer money were aligned with his America First policy. The order, and ensuing stop work orders, threw USAID into turmoil, halting the agencys operations around the world, jeopardizing the delivery of life-saving food and medical aid and throwing global humanitarian relief efforts into chaos. Trump tasked billionaire and adviser Elon Musk with dismantling USAID as part of an unprecedented push to shrink the federal government over what both say is wasteful spending and abuse of funds. Thousands of staff were put on leave and contractors terminated, with workers barred from entering the agencys headquarters in downtown Washington. The majority of those put on leave are not expected to be reinstated. USAID workers left the agency headquarters on Thursday carrying cardboard boxes of personal items to applause and cheers from about 80 people, a mix of fellow workers and members of the public who had come to show their support. Thousands of staff were put on leave and contractors terminated, with workers barred from entering the agencys headquarters in downtown Washington. The majority of those put on leave are not expected to be reinstated. USAID workers left the agency headquarters on Thursday carrying cardboard boxes of personal items to applause and cheers from about 80 people, a mix of fellow workers and members of the public who had come to show their support. This is callous, disrespectful, and no way to treat hardworking middle-class Americans, the American Federation of Government Employees said in a post on X. Angela Stephens, 61, who has worked at USAID in its communications department since 2008, said it was an emotional and sad day for the agencys employees. There is always change when a new administration comes in. What we didnt expect was the entire dissolution of our agency. I dont know what Im going to do next, Stephens said. REVIEW FAST-TRACKED A U.S. State Department spokesperson on Wednesday said that USAID evaluated 6,200 multi-year awards and had decided to eliminate nearly 5,800 of them worth 54 billion in value, a 92 reduction. The administration also cut nearly 30 of the State Department foreign aid-related grants totaling 4.4 billion. The spokesperson said the Trump administration moved to rapidly complete the review after a federal judge intervened and ordered the administration to release frozen funds to foreign aid contractors and grant recipients. That order was paused by U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts late on Wednesday. Pete Marocco, who is currently acting as deputy administrator of USAID and director of foreign assistance at the State Department, said in a court filing that making the payments by the original court-imposed deadline would have been extremely difficult. He added that payments for legitimate expenses incurred prior to January 24 would be made. Despite the wide-ranging cuts, the State Department spokesperson said that critical awards including food assistance, life-saving medical treatments for HIV, and other critical support remained. However, several of the largest U.S.-funded HIVAIDS programs in South Africa were told that their funding would not resume, while a global non-profit that works on malaria and maternal and newborn health had the majority of its contracts canceled. UNAIDS, the United Nations agency tackling HIV and AIDS, had its contract with USAID canceled. Going forward, the State Department and USAID will overhaul the way the U.S. allocates foreign assistance in consultation with Congress, the State Department spokesperson said. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Democrats said in a statement that it was clear the review was not a serious effort or attempt at reform, calling on Secretary of State Marco Rubio to appear before the committee. They said the move creates a power vacuum for our adversaries like China and Russia to fill. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "content": "Pop star Katy Perry and journalists Gayle King and Lauren Sanchez, who is also billionaire Jeff Bezos fiancée, are set to blast off into space on a Blue Origin rocket, marking the first all-female flight crew in more than six decades. The New Shepard rocket, a 59-foot tall (18-meter) suborbital spacecraft, will carry the crew to the Kármán line, the internationally recognized boundary of space, Bezos-owned Blue Origin said in a statement. Passengers will experience a few minutes of microgravity before returning to Earth via parachute-assisted landing in the West Texas desert. NASA rocket scientist Aisha Bowe, bioastronautics researcher Amanda Nguyen and movie producer Kerianne Flynn will make up the rest of the crew. The company has not disclosed a date for the mission. Missions like this can be an effective PR tactic to bring in the private money needed to reduce costs in the long run, said Professor Ehud Behar, astrophysicist at the Technion-Israel Institute of Technology. Ultimately, these investments also support the launch of scientific and commercial instruments into space as well - not just people. This is the 11th human flight for the rocket and its 31st overall. The last recorded all-female spaceflight was the 1963 solo mission of Soviet cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova, the first woman in space. New Shepards first crewed flight in July 2021 carried Jeff Bezos and his brother Mark. The rocket has since taken former NFL player Michael Strahan and Star Trek actor William Shatner, who became the oldest person in space at the age to 90. The companys giant New Glenn rocket blasted off from Florida last month on its first mission to space, an inaugural step into Earths orbit for Jeff Bezos space company as it aims to rival SpaceX in the satellite launch business.

        "content": "Delivering a special statement in parliament today, President Anura Kumara Dissanayake stated that the incumbent government will not allow terrorism and racism to raise their heads once again in the country. He also issued a warning to politicians emphasizing that the era of overthrowing governments through conspiracies and racism is now over. The President, who arrived at the Parliament chamber this evening (28) for the debate on the expenditure head of the Defence Ministry, made these comments while delivering a strongly-worded statement in the House. Dissanayake also assured that the countrys economy is now stable and that they expect the IMF to approve the third review of the bailout programme paving the way for the disbursement of the fourth tranche to Sri Lanka. He stated that the report on the Third Review of Sri Lankas Extended Fund Facility (EFF) program, supported by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), will be presented to the IMFs Executive Board today (28). Expressing further views at the meeting, the President said that he believes that it will yield beneficial results and that the countrys economy is moving towards a very strong position. He also stated that the government is prepared to repeal the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA) through a new legal framework and that a committee has been appointed for this purpose. The Head of State further said that the personnel of the Sri Lanka Army will be reduced to 100,000, the Sri Lanka Navy to 40,000 and the Sri Lanka Air Force to 18,000 by 2030. He declared that the countrys armed forces will be elevated to the level of professional services that will answer only to the state and not to any individuals. The President further issued a warning to opposition politicians seeking to overthrow the incumbent government through various means. He stated: If you are thinking of seizing power through the economic crisis, it is over now. When you look at the history of the overthrow of governments in our country, you will recognize various cases. If you dream that the government will be overthrown due to an economic crisis, it is just a dream. That will not happen. Dont waste words and time on that. They will not happen. Next, there is a history of governments in our country falling by creating crises within parties. In 2001, the government of Chandrika Bandaranaike collapsed. The main reason was that a group of people in the government went to the side and sat down and there were times when governments fell due to internal problems in the government. But you should think that this government is a government that does not create any such internal contradictions. Some people are trying to elevate me and demote others in Parliament. We will not fall for them. Thank you very much. He is good and others are bad. They are good tricks. Will we fall for those tricks? Therefore, if you think, it will not happen to overthrow the government through an internal crisis. Then you will think There is a serious threat to national security and this government will collapse. That will not happen. So, you will have to find some new trump cards and do some research. Then there are other times in history when governments have fallen when people took to the streets, protested, and ousted the rulers. Unless you say something through media conferences, unless you say something in the chamber, I dont think you will be able to gather the people and say something. Therefore, if you are thinking of ousting the government through a public protest, all of that will fail. He added: The era of changing governments in power through conspiracies is over. The era of changing governments in power through racism is over.",

Commenting on this, Police Media Spokesperson, SSP Buddhika Manatunga, stated: The shooting carried out by officers of the Weligama Police was based on the right of self defense, and accordingly, no legal action has been taken against them. However, the deployment of Colombo Crimes Division (CCD) officers to this location has been carried out in an unlawful manner. As a result, the court has ordered the arrest of 8 officers including those who arrived at the scene that day as well as the then Acting IGP Deshabandu Tennakoon, and directed that they be named as suspects in the case. On December 31, 2023, a team of officers from the Colombo Crimes Division had traveled to the Weligama area in Matara with the intention of arresting a group of individuals associated with the notorious underworld figure Nadun Chinthaka Wickremeratne, alias Harak Kata. According to police, officers in civilian attire were attacked from within the W15 Hotel in Weligama, prompting them to open fire in response. Subsequently, a mobile patrol vehicle from the Weligama Police Station arrived at the scene and opened fire on the van in which the CCD officers had arrived. This action was taken due to a misunderstanding, as the Weligama Police officers mistakenly believed that the van was transporting criminals. As a result of the incident, the van left the location; however, by that time, two CCD officers inside had sustained gunshot wounds. One of the injured officers, 47-year-old Police Sergeant Upul Chaminda Kumara of the Colombo Crimes Division, later succumbed to his injuries while receiving medical treatment. A preliminary inquest into the incident was conducted at the Matara Chief Magistrates Court, and the verdict was announced yesterday (27). Following this, the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) has been instructed to arrest and produce the eight individuals, including former Acting IGP Deshabandu Tennakoon, before the court.",

        "date": "March 1, 2025 12:42 am",
        "content": "The International Monetary Fund (IMF) on Friday said its executive board completed the third review under the 48-month Extended Fund Facility (EFF) Arrangement for Sri Lanka, allowing the government to draw SDR 254 million (about US334 million) to support its economic policies and reforms. This brings the total IMF financial support disbursed to Sri Lanka so far to SDR 1.02 billion (about US1.34 billion). The IMF said performance under the program has been strong and that all quantitative targets for end-December 2024 were met, except the indicative target on social spending. Most structural benchmarks due by end-January 2025 were either met or implemented with delay, the statement said, adding that the recent successful completion of the bond exchange is a major milestone towards restoring debt sustainability. Reform efforts are bearing fruit with the recovery gaining momentum. As the economy is still vulnerable, sustaining the reform agenda is critical to put the economy on a path towards lasting recovery and debt sustainability, the IMF said The EFF arrangement for Sri Lanka was approved by the Executive Board on March 20, 2023 in an amount of SDR 2.286 billion (395 percent of quota or about US3 billion). The program supports Sri Lankas efforts to restore and maintain macroeconomic stability and debt sustainability while protecting the poor and vulnerable, rebuild external buffers, and enhance growth-oriented structural reforms including by strengthening governance, the IMF said in a statement. Following the Executive Board discussion on Sri Lanka, Mr. Kenji Okamura, IMF Deputy Managing Director, issued the following statement: Reforms in Sri Lanka are bearing fruit and the economic recovery has been remarkable. Inflation remains low, revenue collection is improving, and reserves continue to accumulate. Economic growth averaged 4.3 percent since growth resumed in the third quarter of 2023. By end-2024, Sri Lankas real GDP is estimated to have recovered 40 percent of its loss incurred between 2018 and 2023. The recovery is expected to continue in 2025. As the economy is still vulnerable, it is critical to sustain the reform momentum to ensure macroeconomic stability and debt sustainability, and promote long-term inclusive growth. There is no room for policy errors. Program performance has been strong with all quantitative targets met, except for the indicative target on social spending. Most structural benchmarks due by end-January 2025 were either met or implemented with delay. Sustained revenue mobilization is crucial to restoring fiscal sustainability and ensuring that the government can continue to provide essential services. Boosting tax compliance and refraining from tax exemptions are key to maintaining support for economic reforms. To ease economic hardship and ensure the poor and vulnerable can participate in Sri Lankas recovery it is important to meet social spending targets and continue with reforms of the social safety net. Going forward, social support needs to be well-targeted towards the most disadvantaged so as to promote inclusive growth with limited fiscal space. Restoring cost-recovery electricity pricing without delay is needed to contain fiscal risks from state-owned enterprises. A smoother execution of capital spending within the fiscal envelope would foster medium-term growth. The progress to advance the debt restructuring to restore Sri Lankas debt sustainability is noteworthy. The recent successful completion of the bond exchange is a major milestone towards restoring debt sustainability. Timely finalization of bilateral agreements with creditors in the Official Creditor Committee and with remaining creditors is a priority now. Monetary policy should prioritize maintaining price stability, supported by sustained commitment to prohibit monetary financing and safeguard Central Bank independence. Continued exchange rate flexibility and gradually phasing out the balance of payments measures remain critical to rebuild external buffers and facilitate rebalancing. Resolving non-performing loans, strengthening governance and oversight of state-owned banks, and improving the insolvency and resolution frameworks are important priorities to revive credit growth and support the economic recovery. Prolonged structural challenges need to be addressed to unlock Sri Lankas long-term potential, including steadfast implementation of the governance reforms.",

Following the incident, a 25-year-old suspect was arrested, according to police. Upon his arrest, police discovered a locally-manufactured hand grenade in his possession. The lorry, loaded with vegetables destined for a supermarket in Norochcholai, had been parked near a tea stall in Wattala when the driver stepped away to have tea. During this time, the suspect stole the vehicle, police said. A three-wheeler pursued the lorry but was unable to stop it, prompting authorities to intervene through the vehicles GPS tracking system. Police initially attempted to stop the lorry in the Wellampitiya area, but the suspect disregarded their orders. Multiple police teams then pursued the vehicle, leading to several gunfire in both the Talahena and Kaduwela areas. Despite police efforts, the suspect continued to evade capture, colliding with two cars, a bus, and a three-wheeler during the chase. Additionally, a gate behind the Ministry of Education in Isurupaya sustained damage as a result of the incident. In an effort to halt the escape, authorities used lorries to block the road in Kaduwela town and set up roadblocks. The suspect, however, attempted to turn back at this location. At that moment, police officers fired additional shots at the lorry, ultimately bringing it to a stop near the Kaduwela court complex. The suspect, a 25-year-old resident of Kelaniya, was taken into custody while attempting to flee. He is scheduled to be produced before the Kaduwela Magistrates Court for further legal proceedings.",

        "title": "Trump, Zelenskiy clash in extraordinary White House row",
        "date": "March 1, 2025 08:22 am",
        "content": "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiys meeting with Donald Trump has ended in disaster, after the two leaders clashed in an extraordinary exchange before the worlds media at the White House over the war with Russia. Zelenskiy had seen the meeting in the Oval Office as an opportunity to convince the United States not to side with Russian President Vladimir Putin, who ordered the invasion of Ukraine three years ago. Instead US President Trump and Vice President JD Vance laid into Zelenskiy, saying he showed disrespect, driving relations with Kyivs most important wartime ally to a new low. The Ukrainian leader was told to leave, a US official said on Friday. An agreement between Ukraine and the United States to jointly develop Ukraines rich natural resources, which Kyiv and its European allies had hoped would usher in better relations, was left unsigned and in limbo. European leaders leapt to Zelenskiys defence. German chancellor candidate Friedrich Merz said we must never confuse aggressor and victim in this terrible war. Zelenskiy spoke by phone with French President Emmanuel Macron, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte and EU Council President Antonio Costa, an official in the Ukrainian delegation in Washington told Reuters. Britain is due to host a meeting of Europes leaders and Zelenskiy on Sunday to discuss a security backstop to any peace agreement between Moscow and Kyiv. Trump has lurched toward Russia since taking over as president, shocking traditional allies in Europe and beyond and leaving Ukraine increasingly vulnerable. Fridays outburst was the most public display of that shift. The already-tense meeting blew up when Vance stressed the need for diplomacy to resolve the biggest conflict in Europe since World War Two. Zelenskiy, his arms folded, countered that Putin could not be trusted and noted that Vance had never visited Ukraine. What kind of diplomacy are you talking about, JD? Zelenskiy asked after recounting failed diplomatic efforts with Russia. Im talking about the kind of diplomacy thats going to end the destruction of your country, Vance shot back. Zelenskiy openly challenged Trump over his softer approach toward Putin, urging him to make no compromises with a killer. Trump, whose team said he and Vance were standing up for Americans, quickly took to Truth Social after the meeting to accuse Zelenskiy of disrespecting the United States. I have determined that President Zelenskyy is not ready for Peace if America is involved, he wrote, using an alternative spelling of the leaders name. He can come back when he is ready for Peace. Trump later told reporters as he left the White House for a weekend at his Florida home that Zelenskiy needs to realise he is losing the war. What hes got to say is, I want to make peace. He doesnt have to stand there and say Putin this, Putin that, all negative things. Hes got to say, I want to make peace. I dont want to fight a war anymore, Trump said. Zelenskiy, asked during an interview by Fox News if his relationship with Trump could be salvaged after Fridays eruption, said, Yes of course and appeared to express some regret, adding Im sorry for this. The Ukrainian leader conducted the meeting in his non-native English, and as it progressed he was drowned out by Trump and Vance. Youre not in a good position. You dont have the cards right now. With us, you start having cards, Trump said. Im not playing cards, Im very serious, Mr President, Zelenskiy said. Youre playing cards. Youre gambling with the lives of millions of people, youre gambling with World War Three, the US president continued. The falling-out meant that Ukraine and the United States failed to sign a much-vaunted minerals deal that Kyiv hoped would spur Trump to back Ukraines war effort and potentially win support from Republicans in Congress for a new round of aid. The clash also undermined efforts by European leaders to convince Trump to provide security guarantees for Ukraine even if he has refused to deploy US soldiers on Ukrainian soil to maintain peace. Such guarantees are seen as crucial to deter Russia from future aggression. Trump instead threatened to withdraw US support from Ukraine. Youre either going to make a deal, or were out, and if were out, youll fight it out. I dont think its going to be pretty, Trump told Zelenskiy. Trump stressed that Putin wants to make a deal. Vance also interjected that it was disrespectful of Zelenskiy to come to the Oval Office to litigate his position, a point Trump agreed with. You didnt say thank you, Vance said. Zelenskiy, raising his voice, responded: I said a lot of times thank you to American people. Zelenskiy, who won billions of dollars of US weaponry and moral support from the Biden administration, is facing a sharply different attitude from Trump. Trump wants to quickly wind down the three-year war, improve ties with Russia and recoup money spent to support Ukraine. Ukraine has rapidly expanded its defence industry production but remains heavily reliant on foreign military assistance, while also struggling to replenish manpower as it battles a much larger foe. While Ukraine repelled Russias invasion from the outskirts of Kyiv and recaptured swathes of territory in 2022, Russia still controls around a fifth of Ukraine and has been slowly taking ground since a failed Ukrainian counteroffensive in 2023. Kyivs troops hold a chunk of land in Russias western Kursk region after a 2024 incursion. Trump has engaged in a long-distance feud with Zelenskiy in recent weeks, criticising his handling of the war, calling him a dictator and urging him to agree to the minerals deal. He subsequently distanced himself from the dictator remark. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

The statement from the Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, was published by the Firat News Agency, a media outlet close to the group. Referring to Abdullah Ocalan, who has been imprisoned by Turkey since 1999, the group said: We declare a ceasefire effective today to pave the way for the implementation of Leader Apos Call for Peace and Democratic Society. None of our forces will take armed action unless attacked. The conflict between Turkey and the PKK has led to tens of thousands of deaths since it began in 1984. On Thursday, a delegation of Kurdish politicians announced Ocalans call for the PKK to lay down its arms and disband after visiting him on his island prison earlier the same day. The cease-fire is the first sign of a break in the conflict since peace talks between the PKK and Ankara broke down in the summer of 2015. In its statement, the PKK said Ocalans statement indicated that a new historical process has begun in Kurdistan and the Middle East. Kurdistan refers to the parts of Turkey, Iraq, Syria and Iran inhabited by Kurds. While stating that it would comply with and implement the requirements of the call from our own side, the PKK emphasized that democratic politics and legal grounds must also be suitable for success. The group also called for Ocalan to be released from Imrali prison, located in the Marmara Sea, to personally direct and execute a party congress that would lead to the militants laying down their arms.

        "date": "March 1, 2025 02:42 pm",
        "content": "Microsoft is closing down Skype, the video-calling service it bought for 8.5 billion in 2011, which had helped spark a transformation in how people communicate online. The tech giant said Friday it will retire Skype in May and shift some of its services to Microsoft Teams, its flagship videoconferencing and team applications platform. Skype users will be able to use their existing accounts to log into Teams. Microsoft has for years prioritized Teams over Skype and the decision to fold the brand reflects the tech giants desire to streamline its main communications app as it faces a host of competitors. Founded in 2003 by a group of engineers in Tallinn, Estonia, Skype was a pioneer in making telephone calls using the internet instead of landlines. It relied on VOIP, voice over internet protocol, technology that converts audio into a digital signal transmitted online. Skype added video calls after online retailer eBay bought the service in 2005. You no longer had to be a senior manager in a Fortune 500 company to have a good quality video call with someone else, said Barbara Larson, a management professor at Northeastern University who studies the history of virtual and remote work. It brought a lot of people around the world closer. The ability to bypass expensive international phone calls to connect with far-flung coworkers was a boon for startups, but also people outside of the business world. You could suddenly have long calls, frequent calls, that were either free or very inexpensive, Larson said. As with other new platforms, scammers also made use of it. By 2011, when Microsoft bought it from eBay, Skype had about 170 million users worldwide, then-Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer said in an event announcing the planned merger. The Skype brand has become a verb, nearly synonymous with video and voice communications, Ballmer said at the time. Skype was still considered high-tech in 2017 when recently inaugurated President Donald Trumps administration used it to field questions from journalists far from the White House press briefing room. It was a month later when Microsoft launched Teams, an attempt to catch up to the growing demand for workplace chatting services sparked by upstart rival Slack Technologies. Slack and Teams, along with newer video platforms such as Zoom, saw explosive growth during the COVID-19 pandemic as companies scrambled to shift to remote work, and even families and friends looked for new tools for virtual gatherings. Skype, by then, was already on the wane but had paved the way for strengthening the connections people can build remotely. Higher-quality media can really deepen relationships and make people able to work through complex problems much better, Larson said. Suddenly, this was available to anyone with a decent internet connection. And that was the real sort of revolutionary role that Skype had. Source: AP --Agencies",

The previous government has agreed to charge 30 tax on IT sector particularly on service exports. Through our discussion and negotiations, the present government was able to reduce it by 50 to the accepted global level of 15, which is on par with the global minimum taxation levels. That is to facilitate the growth of the industries, he said, during a press briefing at the Govt. Information Department. The deputy minister further said that Sri Lanka needs to take this economy from where it is now and to grow exports from the current USD 20 billion to over USD 40 billion within the next 5 years by 2030. The base of the economy, the structure of the economy need to be prepared. That is why several measured were implemented, Suriyapperuma added.",

        "content": "The Matara Magistrates Court has imposed an overseas travel ban on former IGP Deshabandu Tennakoon. This directive was issued today following a request made by the Criminal Investigations Department (CID). The request comes following reports that although the investigating officers had searched the residences of Deshabandu Tennakoon located at Hokandara and Giriulla, they had failed to find him at those homes. The Matara Magistrates Court yesterday ordered the arrest of 8 persons including former officers of the Colombo Crimes Division (CCD) and the former IGP Deshabandu Tennakoon, and to name them as suspects in the shooting incident that took place in front of the W15 Hotel in the Pelena area of Weligama, Matara on December 31, 2023. Commenting on this, Police Media Spokesperson SSP Buddhika Manatunga, had stated: The shooting carried out by officers of the Weligama Police was based on the right of self-defense, and accordingly, no legal action has been taken against them. However, the deployment of Colombo Crimes Division (CCD) officers to this location has been carried out in an unlawful manner. As a result, the court has ordered the arrest of 8 officers including those who arrived at the scene that day as well as the then Acting IGP Deshabandu Tennakoon, and directed that they be named as suspects in the case. On December 31, 2023, a team of officers from the Colombo Crimes Division had traveled to the Weligama area in Matara with the intention of arresting a group of individuals associated with the notorious underworld figure Nadun Chinthaka Wickremeratne, alias Harak Kata. According to police, officers in civilian attire were attacked from within the W15 Hotel in Weligama, prompting them to open fire in response. Subsequently, a mobile patrol vehicle from the Weligama Police Station arrived at the scene and opened fire on the van in which the CCD officers had arrived. This action was taken due to a misunderstanding, as the Weligama Police officers mistakenly believed that the van was transporting criminals. As a result of the incident, the van left the location; however, by that time, two CCD officers inside had sustained gunshot wounds. One of the injured officers, 47-year-old Police Sergeant Upul Chaminda Kumara of the Colombo Crimes Division, later succumbed to his injuries while receiving medical treatment. A preliminary inquest into the incident was conducted at the Matara Chief Magistrates Court, and the verdict was announced on Thursday (27). Following this, the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) had been instructed to arrest and produce the eight individuals, including former Acting IGP Deshabandu Tennakoon, before the court.",

        "title": "European leaders back Zelensky after Trump clash",
        "date": "March 1, 2025 09:42 pm",
        "content": "European leaders have rallied behind Volodymyr Zelensky after Donald Trumps furious exchange with the Ukrainian president in the White House. The leaders of Germany, France, Spain, Poland and the Netherlands were among those who posted social media messages backing Ukraine - with Zelensky responding directly to each one to thank them for their support. The Ukrainian president has arrived in London to attend a summit hosted by UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer who retains unwavering support for Ukraine, Downing Street said. It comes after extraordinary scenes in the Oval Office on Friday as US President Trump clashed with Zelensky, telling him to make a deal with Russia or we are out. At one point, Trump told Zelensky he was not thankful enough for US military and political support during Ukraines fight against Russias invasion, and that he was gambling with World War Three. As a flurry of supportive messages for Ukraine were posted by European leaders following the row - along with posts from the prime ministers of Canada, Australia and New Zealand - Zelensky replied to each one: Thank you for your support. French President Emmanuel Macron posted: There is an aggressor: Russia. There is a victim: Ukraine. We were right to help Ukraine and sanction Russia three years ago - and to keep doing so. Dutch Prime Minister Dick Schoof said the Netherlands supports Ukraine now more than ever, adding: We want a lasting peace and an end to the war of aggression started by Russia. For Ukraine and its people, and for Europe. Germanys outgoing Chancellor Olaf Scholz wrote that no one wants peace more than the citizens of Ukraine, with his replacement-in-waiting Friedrich Merz adding that we stand with Ukraine and we must never confuse aggressor and victim in this terrible war. Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said: Ukraine, Spain stands with you, while his Polish counterpart Donald Tusk wrote: Dear Zelensky, dear Ukrainian friends, you are not alone. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen told Zelensky: Your dignity honours the bravery of the Ukrainian people. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Canada will continue to stand with Ukraine and Ukrainians in achieving a just and lasting peace. Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese posted that his country had proudly supported the brave people of Ukraine in their struggle to defend their sovereignty against the brutality of Russian aggression and in support of international law. There were also supportive messages for Ukraine from political leaders in Austria, Belgium, Croatia, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Ireland, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Moldova, Romania, Sweden and Slovenia. However, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban voiced his support for Trump, writing: Strong men make peace, weak men make war. Today President Donald Trump stood bravely for peace. Even if it was difficult for many to digest. Thank you, Mr President! Zelensky left the White House early following his row with Trump - but afterwards thanked the US president on social media for his support, saying: Ukraine needs just and lasting peace, and we are working exactly for that. Writing on messenger app Telegram on Saturday, Zelensky said it was very important for us that Ukraine is heard and that no one forgets about it, neither during the war nor after. It is important for people in Ukraine to know that they are not alone, that their interests are represented in every country, in every corner of the world, he added. In an interview with Fox News following his White House visit, Zelensky said his row with Trump was not good for both sides but he thought the relationship could be salvaged. The pair interrupted each other repeatedly in front of the media during what was supposed to be a prelude to the two leaders signing an agreement that would give the US access to Ukraines deposits of rare earth minerals. Fridays conversation soured after the US Vice-President JD Vance - who was sitting alongside other politicians in the room - told Zelensky that the war had to be ended through diplomacy. Zelensky responded by asking what kind of diplomacy?, referencing a previous 2019 ceasefire deal that was agreed three years before Russias full-scale invasion when Moscow was supporting and arming separatist fighters in Ukraines east. The vice-president then accused Zelensky of being disrespectful and litigating the situation in front of the media. Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni has called for a summit without delay between the US, Europe and allies on Ukraine. Sir Keirs crunch talks at Downing Street on Sunday will see European leaders gear up efforts to police a future Ukraine peace deal. The UK prime minister believes a deal will have to involve US military assets providing surveillance, intelligence and potentially warplanes giving air cover to deter Russian President Vladimir Putin.

        "date": "March 2, 2025 08:03 am",
        "content": "Israel will adopt the proposal by U.S. President Donald Trumps envoy, Steve Witkoff, for a temporary ceasefire in Gaza for the Ramadan and Passover periods, the prime ministers office said early on Sunday, hours after the first phase of the previously agreed ceasefire was set to expire. On the first day of Witkoffs proposal, half of the hostages held in Gaza, both alive and dead, will be released, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahus office said, adding the remaining hostages will also be released after a permanent ceasefire was agreed. Witkoff made the proposal to extend the current ceasefire after realizing more time was needed for talks on a permanent ceasefire, Netanyahus office added. Hamas spokesperson Hazem Qassem earlier on Saturday said the group rejected Israels formulation of extending the first phase of the ceasefire in Gaza, but did not explicitly mention Witkoffs plan. Netanyahus office said Israel would immediately conduct negotiations on Witkoffs plan if Hamas agreed to it. According to the agreement, Israel can return to fighting after the 42nd day if it feels that the negotiations are ineffective, Netanyahus office also said, accusing Hamas of violating the deal. Both sides have been trading accusations of violating the deal. Two Palestinian officials familiar with the negotiation told Reuters that Israel refused to enter the second phase of the agreement or start negotiations about it. Instead, Israel requested an extension of the first phase, conditioned on the handover of a number of alive prisoners and bodies for each week of extension. Hamas, however, rejected and insisted on adhering to the agreement, entering the second phase, and obliging Israel to what was agreed upon. On Saturday, Hamass armed wing posted a video showing Israeli hostages still in its custody in Gaza and stressed that the remaining hostages can only be freed through a swap deal as stated in the phased ceasefire agreement that began on January 19. The ceasefire agreement halted 15 months of fighting, allowing the exchange of 33 Israeli hostages and five Thais for around 2,000 Palestinian prisoners and detainees. It was meant to lead to subsequent talks to build on the ceasefire deal. Talks about the ceasefire have been ongoing, most recently in Cairo, but have not led to an agreement.

This committee has been appointed by the Secretary of the Ministry of Agriculture, Lands, Livestock, and Irrigation, M.P.N.M. Wickramasinghe, under the guidance of the Minister, K.D. Lalkantha. Accordingly, D.S. Rathnasinghe, the Additional Secretary (Agricultural Development) of the Ministry, has been appointed as the Chairman, along with 15 other members. The committee is currently receiving and evaluating ideas and suggestions from scholars, environmental organizations, environmentalists, farmers, innovators, and citizens on how to prevent damage to crops caused by wild animals and manage the animals responsible for agricultural damage according to the Ministry. In addition, the committee has identified the need to conduct a census of selected wild animals due to the lack of an accurate data system regarding the population of wild animals that damage agricultural crops. This census is planned for next March, and a preliminary survey was recently conducted in the Ingiriya Grama Niladhari Division to assess its feasibility. Additionally, on February 27, a consultation with a group of experts on this subject had been held with the participation of the Minister. During the consultation, the Minister noted that there is currently no institution focused on Wildlife management and emphasized the importance of fostering a discourse on wildlife management within society. The Minister further stated that the current government is expected to intervene and resolve this long-standing issue, which has developed over many years without proper management. The government plans to implement both short-term and long-term measures in line with the recommendations of this committee.

        "date": "March 2, 2025 04:31 pm",
        "content": "Israel has blocked the entry of all humanitarian aid into Gaza as it demands Hamas agree to a US plan for a ceasefire extension. The first phase of the ceasefire expired on Saturday. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahus office said Hamas had so far refused to accept a temporary extension under a proposal by Donald Trumps envoy, Steve Witkoff. A Hamas spokesman said blocking supplies to Gaza was cheap blackmail and a coup on the ceasefire agreement and urged mediators to intervene. The Palestinian group wants phase two of the deal to go ahead as originally negotiated, with the release of hostages and Palestinian prisoners and the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza. It previously said it would not agree to any extension of phase one without guarantees from US, Qatari and Egyptian mediators that phase two would eventually take place. A statement from Netanyahus office said: With the end of Phase 1 of the hostage deal, and in light of Hamass refusal to accept the Witkoff outline for continuing talks - to which Israel agreed - Prime Minister Netanyahu has decided that, as of this morning, all entry of goods and supplies into the Gaza Strip will cease. Israel will not allow a ceasefire without the release of our hostages. If Hamas continues its refusal, there will be further consequences. The Hamas spokesman said: Netanyahus decision to stop aid going into Gaza once again shows the ugly face of the Israeli occupation... The international community must apply pressure on the Israeli government to stop starving our people. Late last night, Netanyahus office said Israel had agreed to a US proposal for the ceasefire to continue for about six weeks during the Muslim Ramadan and Jewish Passover periods. If, at the end of this period, negotiations reached a dead end, Israel would reserve the right to go back to war. US envoy Witkoff has not made his proposal public. According to Israel, it would begin with the release of half of all the remaining living and dead hostages. Witkoff proposed the six-week extension after becoming convinced that more time was needed to try to bridge the differences between Israel and Hamas on conditions for ending the war, according to the earlier statement from Netanyahus office. Israel would immediately start negotiations on this if Hamas changed its position on the six-week ceasefire extension, Netanyahus office said. The first phase of the ceasefire that came into force on 19 January expired on Saturday. It halted 15 months of fighting between Hamas and the Israeli military, allowing the release of 33 Israeli and five Thai hostages for about 1,900 Palestinian prisoners and detainees. But negotiations on phase two, including the release of all remaining living hostages and the withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza, have barely begun. There are believed to be 24 hostages alive, with another 39 presumed to be dead. Hamas carried out an unprecedented attack on Israel on 7 October 2023, killing about 1,200 people and taking another 251 hostage. Israel responded with an air and ground campaign in the Gaza Strip, during which at least 48,365 people have been killed, according to the territorys Hamas-run health ministry.

        "content": "A discussion has been recently held between the Consumer Affairs Authority (CAA) and salt manufacturing companies at the CAAs head office. The discussion had taken place on February 25, and its purpose was to make the necessary interventions to release high-quality salt for industry and food use into the market at a reasonable price. Accordingly, based on the pricing surveys conducted by the CAA regarding salt prices in the market, the varying prices of salt over the past period, the seasonal shortage of salt, and the challenges faced by the salt industry had also been discussed. Representatives from eighteen institutions, including government officials and leading salt producers, attended the meeting, with significant focus placed on stabilizing prices, so that consumers are not inconvenienced due to the current market conditions. The producers also expressed confidence that locally produced salt is scheduled to enter the market in the future and will be sold at competitive prices by the end of March. They also agreed to the CAAs request that prices should remain stable without further increases until then.",

        "content": "The Sri Lanka Navy has swiftly responded to bring ashore a critically ill fisherman and transfer him to the General Hospital, Trincomalee for urgent medical attention on Saturday (01). The fisherman was aboard a local multiday fishing trawler which was off the east coast of Trincomalee, the Navy reported. Reportedly, the multiday fishing trawler Sadaru 03 departed from the Trincomalee fisheries harbour on 01 March with 07 fishermen on board. While at sea approximately 09 nautical miles (16 km) off the coast of Trincomalee, one of the crew members fell critically ill and required urgent medical attention on shore. In response to the situation, the Department of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources alerted the Maritime Rescue Coordination Centre (MRCC) Colombo, which operates from the Navy Headquarters, to coordinate assistance, the navy added. Acting promptly, the Navy deployed a craft from the Eastern Naval Command to rescue the ailing fisherman. After successfully retrieving him from the fishing trawler, the Navy provided initial medical care and brought him to the Trincomalee harbour. He was then urgently transferred to the General Hospital, Trincomalee on the night of 01 March, the statement said. In collaboration with MRCC Colombo, the Navy remains on high alert to promptly address emergencies encountered by maritime and fishing communities within the nations Search and Rescue Region.",

        "date": "March 2, 2025 08:47 pm",
        "content": "Tamil Nadu Governor RN Ravi has engaged with Indian fishermen protesting the Sri Lankan Navys arrest of 32 of their colleagues and seizure of five boats on February 23. During the Sunday meeting, Governor Ravi assured the demonstrators he would raise their concerns with both state and central authorities. Following the discussion, however, Ravi criticized the DMK-led Tamil Nadu government, suggesting they should adopt a constructive approach rather than politicizing the situation. The arrests occurred near the North Mannar region, with Sri Lankan authorities claiming the fishermen had crossed the international maritime boundary. This incident has sparked widespread protests across Tamil Nadus coastal communities. I totally understand your problem. The solution can be derived only by the state and the central government together, and Ill try for that, Ravi told the fishermen while listening to their grievances. In a subsequent social media post, the Governor described the fishermen as victims of an iniquitous agreement of 1974, which he characterized as insensitive to the livelihood concerns of Tamil Nadus fishing communities. He stated that previous governments in Delhi and Chennai had committed a grave sin by depriving fishermen of traditional fishing rights around Katchatheevu island. Instead of politicising this issue and faulting the Central Government, a constructive approach by the State Government will go a long way in wiping the tears of our affected people, Ravi added, noting that the party currently ruling Tamil Nadu was an ally of the central government responsible for the 1974 agreement. The protests, now in their third day, were triggered by the continued detention of over a hundred fishermen and confiscation of numerous boats by Sri Lankan authorities. On Saturday alone, 5,000 fishermen in 450 boats were reportedly intercepted, with 32 arrested and taken to Talaimannar Naval Camp. The ongoing strike has left approximately 700 boats anchored at Rameswaram fishing port, causing daily economic losses estimated at Rs 1 crore. Fishermen leaders have threatened to expand their protests to other coastal districts if authorities fail to secure the prompt release of their detained colleagues.

        "date": "March 2, 2025 10:20 pm",
        "content": "The Academy Awards, the highest honors in the film business, take place on Sunday with no clear frontrunner among Anora, The Brutalist, Conclave and other movies contending for the prestigious best picture prize. Timothee Chalamet and Demi Moore are vying for their first Oscars at the red-carpet ceremony in Hollywood. The show will air live on Walt ABC network starting at 4 p.m. Pacific time (0000 GMT on Monday). Comedian and host Conan OBrien said he planned to mix jokes, celebrations of filmmakers and serious moments including tributes to Los Angeles as it recovers from Januarys wildfires. He likely will address U.S. politics but not dwell on it, he said. Good jokes are really important, but theres also more than that, OBrien told reporters last week as he prepared for his first Oscars hosting gig. Were trying to go for different tones, different textures. This years Oscars race has featured twists and turns, and no movie has dominated the precursor film awards. That will keep the drama going until the end of Sundays show. Any of three films could score best picture, according to Oscars pundits. One is Anora, the story of a sex worker with a shot at a Cinderella story. The other two are The Brutalist, about a Jewish immigrant and architect chasing the American dream, and Conclave, which imagines the secret proceedings for choosing a pope. Others in the best picture field include blockbuster musical Wicked, a prequel to The Wizard of Oz, and A Complete Unknown, the Bob Dylan biopic starring Chalamet. Netflix musical Emilia Perez heads into the ceremony with the most nominations. But its chances of victory dwindled when offensive social media posts surfaced from star Karla Sofia Gascon. The actress, the first openly transgender person nominated for an acting Oscar, disappeared from the awards circuit but is expected to attend Sundays ceremony. Her co-star, Zoe Saldana, is the favorite to win the supporting actress trophy for playing a fixer who helps a Mexican drug lord (Gascon) transition to a woman and start a new life. Winners of the gold Oscar statuettes are chosen by the roughly 11,000 actors, producers, directors and film craftspeople who make up the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. Behind the glitz, Hollywood is fighting a battle to keep its place at the center of the global film business. None of the 10 best picture contenders were filmed in Los Angeles, home to most major film companies for more than a century. Music and Surprises Supporting actor nominee Kieran Culkin is the favorite for his role as a man who travels with his cousin to Poland to study family history in A Real Pain. Best actor could go to either Chalamet or The Brutalist star Adrien Brody, according to awards experts. Brody became the youngest best actor winner when he landed the prize at age 29 for The Pianist in 2002. Chalamet is nine months younger than Brody was at the time. Best actress is widely expected to go to Moore for The Substance, though one pundit said the category could produce an upset win for Brazils Fernanda Torres of Im Still Here. The academy has increased its international membership, which could favor Torres, said Ian Sandwell, movies editor at Digital Spy. She could well be a surprise and the only one to take it away from Demi on the night, Sandwell said. Producers scrapped the annual tradition of having musicians perform each of the nominated original songs, saying they wanted to focus instead on the songwriters. They do promise many musical moments, including a performance by Wicked stars Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo and a tribute to music producer Quincy Jones, who died in November. Also, expect some previously unannounced guests. We absolutely love the element of surprise, executive producer Raj Kapoor said. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "title": "US firm Firefly scores its first moon landing with Blue Ghost spacecraft",
        "date": "March 2, 2025 10:41 pm",
        "content": "Firefly Aerospace succeeded in its first attempt to land on the moon with its uncrewed Blue Ghost spacecraft on Sunday, kicking off a two-week research mission as a handful of private firms compete to reach the frontlines of a global moon race. The size of a compact car, the four-legged Blue Ghost carried 10 scientific payloads as it touched down at around 3:35am ET (0835 GMT) near an ancient volcanic vent on Mare Crisium, a large basin in the northeast corner of the moons Earth-facing side. Suspense and silence fell over a mission control room full of company staff inside Fireflys Austin, Texas headquarters as Blue Ghost descended toward the moons surface at a gentle two miles per hour. Will Coogan, Fireflys Blue Ghost Chief Engineer, confirmed on a mission control live feed the spacecraft had entered lunar gravity. Were on the moon, Coogan declared moments later, prompting cheers in mission control. Firefly becomes the second private firm to score a moon landing, though it declared itself the first company to make a fully successful soft landing. Houston-based Intuitive Machines Odysseus lander made a lopsided touchdown last year, landing mostly intact but dooming many of its onboard instruments. Five nations have made successful soft landings in the past - the then-Soviet Union, the U.S., China, India and, last year, Japan. The U.S. and China are both rushing to put their astronauts on the moon later this decade, each courting allies and giving their private sectors a key role in spacecraft development. Blue Ghost flew on a winding path over three times around Earth, totaling roughly 2.8 million miles, to get to the moon some 238,000 miles (383,000 km) from Earth, reaching the surface a month and a half after launching atop a SpaceX rocket from NASAs Kennedy Space Center in Florida. The moonshot by Firefly, an upstart primarily building rockets, is one of three lunar missions actively in progress. Japans ispace launched its second lander on the same rocket as Fireflys in January, before Intuitive Machines embarked on its second lunar mission on Wednesday. Blue Ghosts three solar panels will power the landers research instruments for a 14-day mission on the moon, before the frigid lunar night brings temperatures as low as minus 280 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 173 degrees Celsius). Crowded Moon Race Missions like Fireflys Blue Ghost represent low-budget precursor missions that will enable research into the lunar environment before the U.S. sends its astronauts there in a series of crewed missions beginning in 2027. China, meanwhile, is making swift progress in its own moon efforts, with its robotic Change lunar program and plans to put Chinese astronauts on the moons surface by 2030. Also eyeing the moon are U.S.-aligned Japan and India, which made its first soft lunar landing in 2023. Firefly has a 101 million contract for the Blue Ghost mission from NASAs Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) program, which hopes to stimulate a private lunar market and make such treks lower-cost and routine. Other countries eyeing the moon and deep space exploration have followed NASAs model for commercial spaceflight, with India investing in its private space sector while Europe funds multiple rocket launch startups. Were hoping to get lower-cost missions at a faster pace, and we just have proof it works, said NASAs CLPS chief Chris Culbert said. We landed on the moon, almost perfectly. The successful touchdown comes at a time of unease and uncertainty across the U.S. space industry, after President Donald Trumps looming shift of the U.S. space programs focus to Mars - a destination favored by SpaceX CEO and influential Trump ally Elon Musk. Acting NASA administrator Janet Petro said at Fireflys landing event that the moon remains part of Americas goal to dominate space. On Blue Ghost, two onboard instruments will study the lunar soil and its subsurface temperatures in experiments by Honeybee Robotics, a firm owned by Blue Origin, which is developing its own lunar lander to send humans to the moon for NASAs Artemis program later this decade. NASAs Langley Research Center has a stereo camera on board to analyze the lunar dirt plumes kicked up by Blue Ghosts landing engine, gathering data to help researchers predict the dusty surface materials dispersal during heavier moon missions in the future.

        "title": "UK, European leaders join forces to draft Ukraine peace plan to take to US",
        "date": "March 3, 2025 06:48 am",
        "content": "British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said on Sunday European leaders had agreed to draw up a Ukraine peace plan to present to the United States, a vital step for Washington to be able to offer security guarantees that Kyiv says are essential to deter Russia. At a summit in London just two days after Volodymyr Zelenskiy clashed with U.S. President Donald Trump and cut short a visit to Washington, European leaders offered a strong show of support to the Ukrainian president and promised to do more to help his nation. European leaders agreed they must spend more on defence to show Trump the continent can protect itself, and the European Commission chief suggested the bloc could ease rules that limit debt levels. Starmer, who welcomed a visibly shaken Zelenskiy on Saturday with a warm hug, said Britain, Ukraine, France and some other nations would form a coalition of the willing and draw up a peace plan to take to Trump. This is not a moment for more talk. Its time to act. Time to step up and lead and to unite around a new plan for a just and enduring peace, Starmer said. Leaders did not provide details of their plan. Before the summit, French President Emmanuel Macron told newspaper Le Figaro that the plan would involve a one-month ceasefire that would apply to air and sea attacks but not to ground combat. European troops would be deployed if a more substantial peace agreement was reached, he said. It was not clear whether other nations had agreed to the terms. Zelenskiy told reporters that Ukraine would not cede any territory to Russia as part of a peace agreement and said he was still willing to sign a minerals deal with the United States. Zelenskiy said he believed he could salvage his relationship with Trump after Fridays shouting match, but that talks would have to take place behind closed doors. The format of what happened, I dont think it brought something positive or additional to us as partners, he said. Europe is scrambling to ensure that Kyiv is not squeezed out of any talks after the Oval Office clash raised fears that the U.S. could pull support for Ukraine and impose a peace plan negotiated with Russia. Several European leaders said they must increase defence spending - something that could help bring Trump on side to offer a U.S. security guarantee in the event of peace. After a long time of underinvestment, it is now of utmost importance to step up the defence investment for a prolonged period of time, Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, the EUs executive body, told reporters. Europe needs to turn Ukraine into a steel porcupine that is indigestible for potential invaders, she said. Europe, which lacks the weaponry and depth of ammunition stocks of the U.S., hopes to convince Trump that it can defend itself but that Russia will only adhere to a peace deal if it comes with the backing of the United States. Talks with the U.S. have centred on Washington providing a so-called backstop for a European peacekeeping role, possibly in the form of air cover, intelligence and surveillance and a greater but unspecified threat if Russian President Vladimir Putin again sought to take more territory. Crucial to getting any agreement from Trump is for European nations to increase defence spending and signal they would take part in any peacekeeping role - something Starmer acknowledged was difficult to get unanimity on. Starmer increased the UKs defence spending before his visit to Washington last week, and NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte said some European leaders had privately set out new plans on defence spending at the meeting but he declined to give details. Uncomfortable Viewing Trump has upended U.S. policy on the three-year-old war since he returned to the White House in January, casting doubt on U.S. military and political support for Ukraine - and Europe - and ending the isolation of Moscow. Trump had blindsided Europe by calling Putin without warning and sending a delegation to Saudi Arabia for talks with Russia without including Ukraine or Europe. Trump has falsely suggested that Kyiv was responsible for starting the war, and on Friday, he criticised Zelenskiy for not being grateful for U.S. aid. Zelenskiys clash with Trump ended a week when Europe had appeared to be in a better position in its drive to encourage Trump to continue to offer support to Ukraine after cordial visits to Washington by Macron and Starmer. Starmer described watching the spat between Zelenskiy and Trump in the Oval Office as uncomfortable viewing, but he was keen to push the conversation forward by offering himself as a go-between for Europe and the United States. In a further show of support for the Ukrainian leader, Zelenskiy later on Sunday flew to meet King Charles at his private residence in eastern England. The Trump administration on Sunday continued to criticise Zelenskiy. White House national security adviser Mike Waltz told CNN that the U.S. needs a Ukrainian leader who is willing to secure a lasting peace with Russia, but that it is not clear Zelenskiy is prepared to do so. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov praised Trumps common sense approach and accused European countries of seeking to prolong the conflict by propping up Zelenskiy with their bayonets in the form of peacekeeping units. Starmer said the leaders on Sunday also agreed to work to ensure Kyiv is at the table of any peace talks and boost the countrys own defence capabilities. Europe must do the heavy lifting, but to support peace in our continent and to succeed, this effort must have strong U.S. backing, Starmer told a news conference. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "date": "March 3, 2025 07:44 am",
        "content": "Kieran Culkin won the Oscar for best supporting actor Sunday at the 97th Academy Awards, completing a sweep of the category that followed his dominance in television awards last season. The award, for portraying the chaotic but endearing Benji in Jesse Eisenbergs A Real Pain, marked his first win and nomination. Culkin thanked his manager, his mom, Eisenberg and his wife, Jazz Charton  taking the moment to remind his wife that he wants more kids. About a year ago, I was on the stage like this, and I very stupidly, publicly, said that I want a third kid from her because she said if I won the award, she would give me the kid, he said, recalling his speech at the Emmys last January. After the show, She goes, oh, God, I did say that. I guess I owe you a third kid. And I turned to her and I said, really? I want four. She said, I will give you four when you win an Oscar, Culkin, who has two kids with Charlton, said to a chorus of laughs from the audience. Jazz, love of my life. Ye of little faith. No pressure, I love you. Culkin triumphed over nominees Guy Pearce for The Brutalist, Edward Norton for A Complete Unknown, Yura Borisov for Anora and his fellow Succession alum Jeremy Strong for The Apprentice. The category was one of few with a clear favorite ahead of this years ceremony, after Culkin picked up the Golden Globe, BAFTA, Independent Spirit Award, SAG Award and a slew of critics awards earlier this month. Written and directed by Eisenberg, A Real Pain follows cousins  played by Culkin and Eisenberg  on a trip through Poland for a Holocaust tour to honor their late grandmother. Culkins Benji is introduced as unfiltered but quick to connect. Eisenbergs David is his rule-following, guarded foil. Oscillating between serious reflections on Jewish identity, generational trauma and mourning and the inherent comedy of mismatched relatives, Eisenbergs script deftly navigates heavy themes with humor that lands because of Culkins ability to deliver it earnestly. Jesse Eisenberg, thank you for this movie. Youre a genius, Culkin said on stage. I would never say that to your face. Im never saying it again. So soak it up. It wasnt a sure bet that Culkins Benji would make it to screens. When production on the final season of Succession ran long, Culkin considered dropping out of the film to spend time with his family. Emma Stone, last years best actress Oscar winner whose company Fruit Tree produced the project, convinced him to stay on  by reassuring him that they could make it work without him, knowing that wasnt necessarily true. She let me off the hook completely, Culkin told The Associated Press of his ex-girlfriend. And I think it was the moment I got off the phone that I was like Oh (expletive), Im doing this movie. Culkins film debut came at age 7 in Home Alone, where he played the soda-slurping younger cousin of his older brother Macaulay Culkins Kevin McCallister. His first major award nomination was a Golden Globe nod for the 2002 film Igby Goes Down. But it was his turn as Roman Roy, on Succession nearly two decades later that brought Culkin widespread fandom and acclaim, including a Golden Globe and Emmy Award for the series final season. Sometimes people will say like, oh, youre a lot like that character. I wasnt until I did it, Culkin said in the press room after his win. But Id like to think that Im a little more together than that. Id like to think that Ive figured some stuff out. Source: AP --Agencies",

My fellow nominees, the love and community that you have offered to me is a true gift, and I will pay it forward. Saldaña accepted the award from the reigning winner in the category, DaVine Joy Randolph. The win adds to a collection of successes for the star on the awards circuit: Saldaña won her first Golden Globe in January, and notched wins at the British Academy Film Awards, the Critics Choice Awards and Screen Actors Guild Awards. My grandmother came to this country in 1961. I am a proud child of immigrant parents. With dreams and dignity and hard working hands, Saldaña said. And I am the first American of Dominican origin to accept an Academy Award. And I know I will not be the last. Saldaña, a front-runner in the category, was among a roster of actors also nominated for the first time, including Monica Barbaro in A Complete Unknown, Ariana Grande in Wicked, and Isabella Rossellini in Conclave. Felicity Jones, nominated for her role in The Brutalist, was previously nominated in 2015. In Emilia Pérez, Saldaña played the down-on-her-luck lawyer Rita Castro, hired by a Mexican drug lord to help facilitate gender-affirming surgery. That drug lord becomes Emilia Pérez, played by best actress nominee Karla Sofía Gascón, the first openly transgender actor nominated for an Oscar. The fact that I am getting an award for a role where I got to sing and speak in Spanish, my grandmother, if she were here, she would be so delighted, Saldaña noted. Jacques Audiards Spanish-language narco-musical had a leading 13 nominations heading into the Oscars, but an already contentious film generated even more controversy after old offensive tweets by Gascón surfaced. The film also received backlash for its depiction of Mexican culture. Saldaña, whose role highlights her range through song and dance, was not spared from critique as some claimed she was in the wrong category, with more screen time than Gascón. An emotional Saldaña last week, and in previous acceptance speeches, credited Emilia Pérez with being a film about identity and love. Ive never been questioned about where I come from or judged by how I speak or what my pronouns are. I believe that everybody has the right to be who they are and Emilia Perez is about truth and is about love, she said in accepting the award for best actress in a supporting role at the Screen Actors Guild Awards. I think that us as actors, now more than ever before, we really have to tell stories that are beautiful and thought-provoking and live within the spectrum of artistic freedom. Saldaña, whose career spans nearly 25 years, is known for her roles in major franchises such as Star Trek as Uhura, Avatar as Navi princess Neytiri, and in the Marvel Cinematic Universe as Gamora, the green-complexioned alien assassin-turned-Guardian of the Galaxy.

        "date": "March 3, 2025 08:19 am",
        "content": "Former Sri Lankan President Ranil Wickremesinghe asserted that India has reached its takeoff point toward becoming an economic superpower. Speaking at the NXT 2025 Conclave in New Delhi, he predicted that by 2050, India would emerge as one of the three global superpowers, alongside the United States and China. Reflecting on his six-decade association with India, Wickremesinghe emphasized the countrys economic trajectory, calling it the driving force that could propel South Asia into a new era of prosperity. I have been coming to India since 1963. Its now that you have to see it. India has reached the take-off point to become an economic superpower, he stated. According to Wickremesinghe, Indias GDP, currently at approximately 3.5 trillion, is expected to soar to 30 trillion by 2050. He highlighted that this extraordinary expansion would reshape the regions economy, fostering supply chains, manufacturing clusters, and economic corridors benefiting nations such as Bangladesh, Nepal, and Sri Lanka. Call to Redefine South Asias Identity Wickremesinghe urged South Asia to reassess its identity, starting with rejecting externally imposed terminologies. The terminology is not ours. It comes from the West. You do not come across this term in any of the South Asian languages, nor in any Indian language. It was in 1949 that the U.S. Security and Defense Establishment, through one of its subcommittees, decided to call our area South Asia. We simply adopted it, he remarked. Comparing the regions integration progress with ASEAN, he pointed out that South Asia has lagged behind. Unlike ASEAN, which built its own successful integration and became part of the Asia-Pacific, South Asia has made very slow progress. Our heads of government havent met since 2014. Yet, we are bound by strong commonalitieslanguages, culture, and civilizational ties, he added. Wickremesinghe envisioned an expanded Greater South Asia extending beyond SAARCs current boundaries, incorporating the Indo-Gangetic Plain, the Indian Peninsula, the Himalayas, Afghanistan, and the Indian Ocean islands. He also stressed the need for stronger economic ties linking the region with Southeast Asia, the Arabian Sea, and the Mediterranean. Indias Economic Surge and Regional Trade Dynamics Wickremesinghe predicted that South India alone would develop into a 6 trillion economy by 2050, naturally fostering economic corridors connecting Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Nepal, and Southeast Asia into an India-centric supply chain. He also pointed out that while Chinas trade with ASEAN is expected to triple, Indias trade could grow nine-fold, potentially bringing ASEAN closer to India than China over time. However, he warned against protectionist trade policies in the region, stating that the vestiges of Nehruvian socialism still persist in South Asias economic strategies.

There is an unlimited amount of falsehood being spread in Parliament. That is due to the privilege given. This privilege has been granted to address the concerns of the people, not to propagate lies. This must change. If it is being misused and the government does not take action, I will bring a Private Members Motion to rectify the situation. Let us see how many of the 225 Members of Parliament oppose lying in Parliament. If we speak the truth, we do not need such a privilege. I do not require it.

        "date": "March 3, 2025 09:48 am",
        "content": "Anora, a strip club Cinderella story without the fairy tale ending, was crowned best picture at the 97th Academy Awards on Sunday, handing Sean Bakers gritty, Brooklyn-set screwball farce Hollywoods top prize. In a stubbornly fluctuating Oscar season, Anora, the Palme dOr-winner at the Cannes Film Festival, emerged as the unlikely frontrunner. Bakers tale of an erotic dancer who elopes with the son of a Russian oligarch  unusually explicit for a best-picture winner  was made for just 6 million. But Oscar voters, eschewing blockbuster contenders like Wicked and Dune: Part Two, instead added Anora to a string of recent indie best picture winners, including Everything Everywhere All at Once, CODA and Nomadland. For a film industry thats been transformed by streaming and humbled by economic turmoil, Baker and Anora epitomized a kind of cinematic purity. On the campaign trail, Baker called for the return to the 90-day exclusive theatrical release. Where did we fall in love with the movies? At the movie theater, Baker said Sunday. Filmmakers, keep making films for the big screen. In personally winning four Oscars on Sunday, Baker tied the mark held by Walt Disney, who won for four different films in 1954. That Baker and Disney share the record is ironic; his The Florida Project took place in a low-budget motel in the shadow of Disney World. Long live independent film! shouted Baker from the Dolby Theatre stage. Eight of the 10 movies nominated for best picture came away with at least one award at the Dolby Theatre on Sunday, in a ceremony that saw the acting wins go to Madison, Adrien Brody, Kieran Culkin and Zoe Saldaña. Twenty-two years after winning best actor for The Pianist, Brody won the same Oscar again for his performance as another Holocaust survivor in Brady Corbets The Brutalist. His win came over Timothée Chalamet (A Complete Unknown), who had the chance of becoming the youngest best actor ever, a record owned by Brody. Im here once again to represent the lingering traumas and the repercussions of war and systematic oppression and of antisemitism and racism and othering, said Brody. I pray for a healthier and happier and more inclusive world. If the past can teach us anything its to not let hate go unchecked. Madison won best actress for her breakthrough performance in Anora, a victory that came over the category favorite, Demi Moore (The Substance). Both she and Baker spoke, as they did at the Cannes Film Festival where Anora won the Palme dOr, about honoring the lives of sex workers. Netflixs beleaguered contender Emilia Pérez, the lead nominee going into the show, weathered the scandal caused by offensive tweets by star Karla Sofía Gascón, to pick up awards for best song and best supporting actress, for Saldaña. I am a proud child of immigrant parents with dreams and dignity and hard-working hands, said Saldaña. I am the first American of Dominican origin to accept an Academy Award, and I know I will not be the last. Source: AP --Agencies",

Baker had been favored to win the directing award, having collected top honors from the Directors Guild of America and the Producers Guild of America, and the directing award at the Film Independent Spirit Awards. The filmmakers first breakout project was Tangerine, a comedy about a transgender sex worker in Los Angeles that was shot on an iPhone. His next film, The Florida Project, focused on the plight of families living in poverty near Walt Disney World and told the story of a single mother and the manager of a roadside motel who seek to protect a six-year-old girls innocence. Bakers next film, Red Rocket, follows a washed-up porn star to Texas. His most recent film, Anora, dubbed a bawdy modern fable by one reviewer, received a total of six nominations, including for best picture.

        "date": "March 3, 2025 10:39 am",
        "content": "Every year on March 3, people celebrate World Wildlife Day to honour the beauty of nature and raise awareness about the need to protect animals, plants, and ecosystems. This special day reminds us that wildlife is not just about the fascinating creatures we see in forests, oceans and skies, but also essential for our survival. Wildlife includes all living things that exist naturally without human interference, from majestic creatures like Tigers, Lions and colourful birds to tiny insects and giant trees. These creatures play a key role in keeping nature balanced. Birds help spread seeds, insects pollinate flowers and trees provide the oxygen we breathe. However, many species are under threat due to deforestation, pollution, climate change and illegal hunting. If we do not take action, we could lose these amazing species forever. World Wildlife Day was officially established by the United Nations in 2013, but its roots go back to 1973, when the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) was signed to protect animals and plants from illegal trade. March 3 was chosen as the official date because it was the same day CITES was adopted. The theme for World Wildlife Day 2025 is Wildlife Conservation Finance: Investing in People and Planet. This year, the focus is on the financial challenges of protecting wildlife. Over one million species are at risk of extinction, yet funding for conservation is far too low. Experts say that while governments spend about 13 crore per year, at least 72 crore is needed. To bridge this gap, new financial ideas like Debt-for-Nature swaps (where countries invest in conservation instead of paying debts) and Wildlife Conservation Bonds (where private investors fund wildlife projects) are being explored. The 2025 celebrations will include a major United Nations event in Geneva, Switzerland, which will be live-streamed for global audience. On the other hand, the International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW) is organising a Youth Art Contest to inspire young artists, while Jackson Wild will showcase films about conservation efforts. People from in and around the world will be participating in the events to encourage businesses and governments to invest in protecting nature. Anyone can be part of World Wildlife Day 2025 by learning about wildlife conservation, attending local or online events and supporting organisations that protect endangered species. Wildlife is more than just natures beauty, it is the foundation of life on Earth. Lets celebrate this day together by investing in conservation today and ensuring a better future for generations to come. Source: Telangana Today --Agencies",

        "date": "March 3, 2025 10:50 am",
        "content": "Brazilian movie Im Still Here, set against the backdrop of the military dictatorship and recounting the true story of a mother of five whose husband disappears, made history on Sunday by earning Brazil its first Oscar in a major category. However, the film fell short of winning best picture, which went to Anora, and Brazilian actress Fernanda Torres did not win the Oscar for best actress. Adapted from the poignant 2015 memoir written by Marcelo Rubens Paiva, the son of main character Eunice Paiva, I Am Still Here shares familys heart-wrenching story of loss and resilience in the face of oppression. In his acceptance speech, director Walter Salles dedicated the award to Eunice Paiva and the two actresses that play her in the movie, Fernanda Torres and her mother Fernanda Montenegro. I think its not a film that has been recognized. Its a culture thats being recognized. Its the way we do cinema in Brazil that is being recognized, Salles told reporters backstage. The Paiva family was among the many victims of the military regime in Brazil, which lasted for 21 years and was established following a coup detat by the armed forces in 1964. During this period, thousands of people were detained, tortured, and hundreds forcibly disappeared, with many being exiled and persecuted. Salles sees democracy becoming more fragile around the world. I never thought it would be so fragile in this country, he said, referring to the U.S. And therefore what happened in Brazil in the past feels very close to our present. The last Brazilian film to be nominated by the Academy in the international category was Central Station in 1999, also directed by Salles. In 1960, France, Italy, Brazil co-production Black Orpheus, with a predominantly Brazilian cast and French direction won the international category, but the recipient of the prize was France. The Oscars ceremony coincided with Brazils Carnival, and as the news of the win spread, the streets erupted in joy. Thousands of revelers, many of whom were holding Oscar statuettes or dressed as Academy Awards nominee Fernanda Torres, celebrated with music, dance, and festivities, despite widespread frustration over Torres defeat. Brazils President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva posted on social media that the award recognized a work that showed the importance of fighting authoritarianism. Today is the day to feel even prouder of being Brazilian. Proud of our cinema, our artists and, above all, proud of our democracy, he wrote. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "content": "Tamil Progressive Alliance (TPA) leader and opposition MP Mano Ganesan on Saturday slammed the Sri Lankan government over the exit of Adani Green Energy from the island nation, saying that it has sent the wrong signal to the world. Speaking in Parliament during a debate, Ganesan accused the government of mishandling the project and asserted that it was not the administration that dropped Adani, but rather the Indian conglomerate that abandoned the government. You didnt drop Adani. The truth is Adani dropped you, he said, criticising the government and President Anura Kumara Dissanayake over its handling of the project. Furthermore, the opposition MP also argued that the Adani project was not just about supplying energy to Sri Lankas domestic grid but also aimed at exporting power to India, a move that could have generated revenue for the island nation. Our concerns over pricing, if any, could have been negotiated. Instead, this government failed to recognise the long-term economic benefits of energy exports to India, Ganesan said. The MP also questioned President Anura Dissanayakes recent visit to the United Arab Emirates, questioning its outcome. President went to the UAE and returned. What happened there? Is any investment coming in? International investors, especially from the Middle East and Europe, would only consider Sri Lanka if Indian partnerships were in place, he said. Ganesan also described Adanis withdrawal as a major blunder that could deter future investments in Sri Lanka, particularly in the renewable energy and infrastructure sectors. Taking to social media, Ganesan reiterated his concerns and said, The prospective energy export through grid connectivity with India would have brought revenue to Sri Lanka. You failed to understand this with an eye on the future. The exit of Adani has sent wrong signals to potential foreign investors looking at Sri Lanka. Last month, Adani Green Energy announced its withdrawal from two proposed wind power projects in Sri Lanka, following the new governments decision to renegotiate tariffs. The decision was conveyed in a letter sent by the company to Sri Lankas Board of Investment. Adanis renewable energy arm had planned a USD 442 million investment in Sri Lankas wind power sector, covering both generation and transmission. However, the newly-elected government under President Anura Kumara Dissanayake aimed to cut electricity costs tied to Indian conglomerates energy projects in the country.

        "date": "March 3, 2025 11:58 am",
        "content": "A wild elephant is reported to be in critical condition after being hit by a Batticaloa-Colombo train near the Mahaweli Bridge in Manampitiya at around 8.30 a.m. on Monday (03), according to officials from the Manampitiya Wildlife Office. The elephant, a 25-year-old male, was moving from Somawathiya National Park to Flood Plains National Park when it was struck by the train. The impact dragged the animal nearly 20 meters, causing severe injuries and damaging several railway sleepers, Ada Derana reporter said. A team of wildlife officers and veterinarians from the Giritale Wildlife Office, has been dispatched to the scene to provide emergency treatment for the elephant. Meanwhile, a tragic train collision that killed seven wild elephants in the Gal Oya area on February 20 has reignited concerns over railway safety and conservation efforts, especially along the Batticaloa railway line. Against this backdrop, Sri Lanka Railways today (03) announced new speed limits and revised train schedules for night operations in areas where elephant crossings are common, in order to prevent frequent elephant-train collisions. The revised train schedule is set to take effect from March 7, 2025.",

        "date": "March 3, 2025 12:38 pm",
        "content": "President Donald Trump signed on Saturday an executive order designating English as the official language of the United States. The order allows government agencies and organizations that receive federal funding to choose whether to continue to offer documents and services in language other than English. It rescinds a mandate from former President Bill Clinton that required the government and organizations that received federal funding to provide language assistance to non-English speakers. Establishing English as the official language will not only streamline communication but also reinforce shared national values, and create a more cohesive and efficient society, according to the order. In welcoming new Americans, a policy of encouraging the learning and adoption of our national language will make the United States a shared home and empower new citizens to achieve the American dream, the order also states. Speaking English not only opens doors economically, but it helps newcomers engage in their communities, participate in national traditions, and give back to our society. More than 30 states have already passed laws designating English as their official language, according to U.S. English, a group that advocates for making English the official language in the United States. For decades, lawmakers in Congress have introduced legislation to designate English as the official language of the U.S., but those efforts have not succeeded. Within hours of Trumps inauguration last month, the new administration took down the Spanish language version of the official White House website. Hispanic advocacy groups and others expressed confusion and frustration at the change. The White House said at the time it was committed to bringing the Spanish language version of the website back online. As of Saturday, it was still not restored. The White House did not immediately respond to a message about whether that would happen. Trump shut down the Spanish version of the website during his first term. It was restored when President Joe Biden was inaugurated in 2021. Source: AP --Agencies",
