        "title": "One dead, six missing after luxury yacht sinks off Sicily",
        "date": "August 19, 2024 04:33 pm",
        "content": "One man died and six people were missing after a luxury yacht was struck by an unexpectedly violent storm and sank off the Sicilian capital Palermo, the Italian coast guard said on Monday. The 56-metre-long (184-ft) sailboat, which was British registered, sank with 22 people on board shortly before sunrise, the coast guard said in a statement. The missing people were of British, American and Canadian nationality, the coast guard said. The wind was very strong. Bad weather was expected, but not of this magnitude, a coast guard official in Palermo told Reuters. Storms and heavy rainfall have swept down Italy in recent days - with floods and landslides causing major damage in the north of the country - after weeks of scorching heat. Eight of the 15 people rescued, including a one-year-old child, were transferred to local hospitals. All were in a stable condition, local media reported. The coast guard said the boat had been found at a depth of 49 metres and that divers were inspecting the wreck. Prosecutors in the nearby town of Termini Imerese have opened an investigation to look into what had gone wrong. The coast guard named the yacht as the Bayesian, built by Italian shipbuilder Perini in 2008. The luxury ship has an aluminium hull and can carry 12 guests and a crew of up to 10, according to online specialist yacht sites. The boat left the Sicilian port of Milazzo on Aug. 14 and was last tracked east of Palermo on Sunday evening, with a navigation status of at anchor, according to vessel tracking app Vesselfinder. A U.K. foreign ministry spokesperson said British officials were in contact with local authorities over the incident and were ready to provide consular support for Britons who were affected.

The report indicated that the increase in New Orders and Production was mainly attributable to the manufacture of food and beverage and textile  apparel sectors. Meanwhile, employment has turned positive in July 2024 while the Stock of Purchases also expanded in line with the increased demand for materials, as per the CBSL report. The services Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) indicated a further expansion in service activities in July 2024 as reflected by the Business Activity Index, which recorded an index value of 71.1, the highest value recorded so far this year. The continued expansion in business activities was driven by the improvements observed in the freight and aviation sectors, while new businesses increased in July, particularly with the upsurges observed in financial and transportation services.

        "title": "Sri Lankan national on board luxury yacht that sank off Sicily coast  reports",
        "date": "August 19, 2024 07:06 pm",
        "content": "Several British tourists are feared missing after a boat sank off the coast of Sicily. The UK-flagged sailboats sinking has left seven individuals unaccounted for following a rescue operation. The Italian Coastguard and firefighters managed to rescue 15 people, among them a one-year-old child. It is believed the vessel succumbed to a tornado that hit the region. The majority of those on board were British, along with a New Zealander, a Sri Lankan national, two Anglo-French individuals, and an Irish citizen. According to the Italian news outlet Il Fatto Quotidiano, the boat went down near Porticello around 5am local time (4am GMT) on Monday (August 19). Dive teams have reached the sunken hull, located 49 meters underwater and roughly half a mile from shore, as reported by the same source, reports the Express. Those rescued from the ill-fated vessel have been brought to Porticciolo, detailed Il Fatto Quotidiano. The Agenzia ANSA news service has announced that efforts to find the seven missing from the dawn-sunken sailing boat are ongoing near Porticello. The agencys report indicates that the missing include four Britons, a Canadian, and two Americans. A Facebook post showing the last image taken at 10pm before the disaster stated: Last picture I took at 10pm. The yacht on the left sunk at 4:05, caught in the middle of the hurricane 300 meters from the port of Porticello, next to another sailboat that provided rescue. It looks like there are 22 on board but unfortunately seven missing, theyre still afraid inside the hull. Unbelievable tragedy tonight. Im out of words. Another Italian daily, Corriere della Sera, has identified the boat involved as the Bayesian, a superyacht which, according to an online profile, was launched in 2008. The Superyacht Times has reported that the Bayesians hull and superstructure are constructed out of aluminium and is outfitted with two MTU engines, facilitating a top speed of 15.6 knots. Its been disclosed that the vessel was crafted by Perini Navi, a renowned boatmaker located in Viareggio, Tuscany. The boat capsized at around 5am off Palermo. Local media said a fierce storm, including water spouts, battered the area overnight. The daily Il Giornale de Sicilia reported the sailboat was flying a British flag and had mostly British passengers on board, but also people from New Zealand, Sri Lanka, Ireland and British-French citizens. The ANSA news agency said the boat, which it said was named Bajesian, had been moored in the port at Porticello and had set sail on Sunday evening. A small and localized tornado  known as a waterspout  spun over the area Sunday through Monday and likely caused the boat to sink, according to a report from the European Severe Weather Database. Other strong storms across Sicily brought torrential rainfall late Sunday, dumping more than 4 inches (100 mm) of rainfall, in the Brolo, east of Palermo, in less than four hours. The weather forecast had warned of potential strong winds, with storms across the entire southern region of Italy Sunday, a Coast Guard spokesperson added. The captain is among the survivors, the spokesperson for Italys Coast Guard said. The 56-meter yacht called the Bayesian, which flies under a British flag, had mostly British passengers and crew, in addition to two Anglo-French, one New Zealander, one Irish and one Sri Lankan, the spokesperson told CNN. The Italian fire brigade said its divers had reached the yachts hull 49 meters (160 feet) below sea level, according to a press statement. The brigade also dispatched helicopters to bolster the search operation. The captain of a nearby boat said he turned on his engine to avoid crashing into the Bayesian, Reuters reported, as fierce gales swept the area. This morning we got this strong gust and we had to start the engine to keep the ship in an angled position, he told reporters on Monday. After the storm was over, we noticed that the ship behind us was gone. --With agencies inputs",

        "content": "The new luxury shuttle service which was recently launched to provide passenger transport services from the Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) to the Colombo Fort Railway Station and the Multimodal Transport Centre (MMC) in Makumbura, has been temporally suspended effective from today (August 19). The relevant luxury bus service was initiated on August 15, however, it had faced immediate protests on the very same day. Specifically, the Airport-Fort Bus Employees Union had launched a bus strike on August 16 against the newly-initiated luxury airport shuttle service. In addition to this, the union had also lodged complaints with the Ministry of Transport and Highways as well as the Election Commission. The BIA taxi service associations had also expressed their support to the protest campaigns. Accordingly, after considering the concerns put forward, it has been decided to temporarily suspend the Airport Terminal Shuttle Service after only four days of operation. President of the Airport-Fort Bus Employees Union, Indika Gunasekara said that instead of the suspended luxury shuttle service, it is expected to allocate ten of the unions buses from the Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) to the Colombo Fort Railway Station and the Multimodal Transport Centre (MMC) in Makumbura.",

        "date": "August 20, 2024 08:42 am",
        "content": "Pakistans jailed former prime minister Imran Khan has applied to become the next chancellor of Britains prestigious University of Oxford, his party said. Khan, prime minister from 2018 to 2022, has just marked one year in prison on various charges from corruption to inciting violence that he said are politically motivated and designed to keep him from power. Imran Khan had given instructions that he would like to submit his application and now the application scrutiny will take place, Sayed Zulfikar Bukhari, the London-based spokesman for Khans Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party, told AFP. Its a ceremonial post but one with utmost prestige and importance and Imran Khan, being one of the larger or more popular names coming out of Oxford, it would be brilliant to see him as chancellor, he said. Conservative peer Chris Patten, the last British governor of Hong Kong, announced in February he was stepping down as Oxford chancellor. The list of candidates for the 10-year term will not be made public until October, according to the universitys website, with voting taking place at the end of the month. Khan graduated from Oxford in 1975 after studying philosophy, politics, and economics. He led a playboy lifestyle during his career as one of Pakistans greatest cricket players, regularly gracing the pages of Britains gossip magazines. Married three times, including to British socialite and filmmaker Jemima Goldsmith, he later turned to philanthropy and politics. He faced a backlash from womens rights groups while prime minister for linking Pakistans high rates of sexual violence to the clothes that women wear. Khan was ousted in 2022 and then launched a comeback campaign in which he criticised Pakistans powerful military, whose leading generals had once backed him, and drew massive crowds onto the nations streets. If he does become the chancellor, he would be the first of Asian descent. It wouldnt be something only for Pakistan, but it would be a great achievement for all of Asia and the rest of the world, Bukhari said. Other prominent applicants and Oxford alumni include former foreign secretary William Hague and former EU trade commissioner Peter Mandelson, according to British media reports.

        "title": "President Ranil reveals why he chose Gas Cylinder as symbol instead of Elephant",
        "date": "August 20, 2024 09:16 am",
        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe emphasized that even if he successfully resolves the economic crisis that others have failed to address, the countrys economy will collapse again if the necessary economic transformations are interrupted midway. He urged citizens to carefully consider their future when making decisions in the upcoming presidential election. The President made these remarks during a recent session of the Ask Ranil program, where he responded to questions raised on social media. He also addressed criticisms, arguing that it is inaccurate to claim that previous leaders have done nothing for the countrys development over the past 75 years. He pointed out that rapid economic growth has been hindered by ideologies like those of the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna, which advocate for a domestic economy. The President emphasized that to overcome the economic crisis facing the country, a new approach is neededone that transcends party differences. He mentioned that a significant number of people support him in this effort, which is why he has decided to run as an independent candidate in the upcoming presidential election. When asked why he chose the Gas Cylinder as his symbol instead of the Elephant, he responded, I decided to run as an independent candidate in the upcoming presidential election. There is a strong sentiment today that political parties should be set aside. In line with this, we need to rethink our political approach. As I have worked with various groups, I decided to compete independently. An independent candidate can choose any symbol, and I felt that the Gas Cylinder was the most fitting symbol at this time. Question: There are people who believe you can strengthen the economy, but some are hesitant to vote due to your association with the Rajapaksas and the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP). What message do you have for them? Answer: Which Rajapaksa are you referring to? There are three candidates named Rajapaksa: Lakshman Namal Rajapaksa, Namal Rajapakshe, and Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe. But none of them are with us. The important question is whether the situation today is better than it was in July 2022? I received the support of the SLPP to lead the government. Without their support, there would have been no fuel or fertilizer. That phase of governance is now complete. We are heading into an election, and they will go their way while I go mine. There are hundreds of thousands of Rajapaksas in Sri Lanka, and some of them might vote for me. However, that party has chosen to contest the presidential election separately, and so will we. Question: Mr. President, despite having resources like the Pulmoddai Mineral Sand Deposit, Trincomalee Harbour, and Hambantota Airport, we have become debtors to the world. Various political parties accuse the rulers of the past 75 years of failing to take proper advantage of these resources. Answer: Its incorrect to say that nothing has been done in the past 75 years. We built all the hydropower plants, constructed airports, and established the free education system. How can anyone claim that nothing was done? Many believed that relying solely on the domestic economy was sufficient. But we need to be open to the world. We failed to achieve rapid development because parties like Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna insisted on a purely domestic focus. No country has succeeded that way. If you look at successful countries like Singapore and Hong Kong, the need to be outward-looking is clear. Therefore, we need to learn from those countries. Question: Mr. President, you introduced laws to prevent various corruption schemes. However, there is a perception among the public that this legal system only catches the small offenders while the bigger ones get away. Answer: Can you name any small offenders caught through this method? Its not just small fish but also sharks that are targeted. When we came to power in 2015, several teams were established to address corruption. There was a special division under the President, the Criminal Investigation Department of the police was there, another separate police unit created for this purpose, and the Bribery Commission. There was also an Anti-Corruption Secretariat established by the Attorney Generals Department. Despite these efforts, legal challenges arose in certain areas, which is why we implemented this new system. If individuals have earned income illegally, action will be taken against them. Its also crucial to train the necessary personnel to effectively carry out these tasks. Question: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is becoming increasingly popular in various fields. What impact do you think Artificial Intelligence will have on future politics and the economy? Answer: We need to explore how Artificial Intelligence can be integrated into our society and economy. It has the potential to become a global tool, but also an international weapon. Countries around the world are still deliberating on this, and laws are being developed to address the issue. This will be a major topic of discussion in the next decade. Artificial Intelligence has the power to both create and destroy. Currently, we have not yet established a legal framework that outlines the benefits of Artificial Intelligence and how it can be regulated. It is essential to recognize that this is a highly modern and evolving concept. All of these developments will take time. While I acknowledge the importance of artificial intelligence, it must be accompanied by proper controls. Question: What are your plans to improve the efficiency of the public service? Answer: Over the past 10 years, we have implemented several measures to improve public service. Although there is a surplus of staff, simply asking them to leave could lead to significant social unrest, as many lack alternative sources of income. They might end up protesting, similar to what has happened in Bangladesh. Therefore, we need to manage this situation carefully. Employees spend their wages rather than saving them, which contributes to the economy. We must consider how to address this issue while protecting their future. Our goal is to modernize public service. Many employees at the grassroots level require new programs and training. While the efficiency of public service is often tested during emergencies like floods, it is essential to recognize both its successes and shortcomings.",

        "title": "US intelligence officials say Iran is to blame for hacks targeting Trump, Biden-Harris campaigns",
        "date": "August 20, 2024 09:58 am",
        "content": "U.S. intelligence officials said Monday they were confident that Iran was responsible for the hack of Donald Trumps presidential campaign, casting the cyber intrusion as part of a brazen and broader effort by Tehran to interfere in American politics and potentially shape the outcome of the election. The assessment from the FBI and other federal agencies was the first time the U.S. government has assigned blame for hacks that have raised anew the threat of foreign election interference and underscored how Iran, in addition to more sophisticated adversaries like Russia and China, remains a top concern. Besides breaching the Trump campaign, officials also believe that Iran tried to hack into the presidential campaign of Kamala Harris. The hacking and similar activities, federal officials said, are meant to sow discord, exploit divisions within American society and possibly to influence the outcome of elections that Iran perceives to be particularly consequential in terms of the impact they could have on its national security interests, officials said. We have observed increasingly aggressive Iranian activity during this election cycle, specifically involving influence operations targeting the American public and cyber operations targeting Presidential campaigns, said the statement released by the FBI, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency. Irans mission to the United Nations denied the allegations as unsubstantiated and devoid of any standing, saying that Iran had neither the motive nor intention to interfere with the election. It challenged the U.S. to provide evidence and said if the U.S. does so, we will respond accordingly. The FBI statement was released at a time of significant tensions between Washington and Tehran as the U.S. hopes to halt or limit a threatened retaliatory strike on Israel over the assassination of Hamas official Ismail Haniyeh in Iran. In addition, an Israeli strike last month in southern Beirut killed Hezbollahs top commander, but while Tehran and Iran-backed Hezbollah have vowed to retaliate, they have not yet launched strikes as diplomatic endeavors and Gaza cease-fire talks continue in Qatar. The U.S. did not detail how it reached the conclusion that Iran was responsible, nor did it describe the nature of any information that may have been stolen from the Trump campaign. But it said the intelligence community was confident the Iranians have through social engineering and other efforts sought access to individuals with direct access to the Presidential campaigns of both political parties. At least three staffers in the Biden-Harris campaign were targeted with phishing emails, but investigators have uncovered no evidence the attempt was successful, The Associated Press reported last week. Such activity, including thefts and disclosures, are intended to influence the U.S. election process. It is important to note that this approach is not new. Iran and Russia have employed these tactics not only in the United States during this and prior federal election cycles but also in other countries around the world, the statement said. U.S. officials have been on high alert in recent election cycles for foreign influence campaigns and outright interference as in 2016, when Russian military intelligence operatives hacked the campaign of Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton and orchestrated the release of politically damaging emails through the website WikiLeaks. Iran has more recently emerged as an aggressive threat to American elections. In 2020, U.S. intelligence officials say, Iran carried out an influence campaign aimed at harming Trumps reelection bid that was probably approved by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and was the subject of an unusual evening news conference featuring FBI Director Christopher Wray and other officials. U.S. officials also have expressed alarm about Tehrans efforts to seek retaliation for a 2020 strike on an Iranian general that was ordered by Trump. The Trump campaign disclosed on Aug. 10 that it had been hacked and said Iranian actors had stolen and distributed sensitive internal documents. At least three news outlets  Politico, The New York Times and The Washington Post  were leaked confidential material from inside the Trump campaign. So far, each has refused to reveal any details about what it received. Politico reported that it began receiving emails on July 22 from an anonymous account. The source  an AOL email account identified only as Robert  passed along what appeared to be a research dossier the campaign had apparently done on the Republican vice presidential nominee, Ohio Sen. JD Vance. The document was dated Feb. 23, almost five months before Trump selected Vance as his running mate. The U.S. governments assessment aligns with the findings of private companies. Earlier this month, Microsoft issued a report on Iranian agents attempts to interfere in this years election. It said Iran had impersonated activists and created fake news targeted to voters on opposite sides of the political spectrum. The report also cited an instance of an Iranian military intelligence unit in June sending a spear-phishing email to a high-ranking official of a presidential campaign from a compromised email account of a former senior advisor. In a separate report, Google said an Iranian group linked to the countrys Revolutionary Guard has tried to infiltrate the personal email accounts of roughly a dozen people linked to President Joe Biden and Trump since May.

        "title": "Blinken says Israel accepts Gaza proposal, urges Hamas to do same",
        "date": "August 20, 2024 12:31 pm",
        "content": "U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Monday Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had accepted a bridging proposal presented by Washington to tackle disagreements blocking a ceasefire deal in Gaza, and urged Hamas to do the same. Blinken spoke to journalists after a day of meetings with Israeli officials, including a 2-12-hour meeting with Netanyahu. The top U.S. diplomat had said earlier that this push was probably the best and possibly last opportunity for a deal. Talks in Qatar seeking a ceasefire and hostage return agreement last week paused without a breakthrough, but were expected to resume this week based on the U.S. proposal to bridge the gaps between Israel and Hamas. Blinkens visit comes as U.S. President faces mounting election-year pressure over his stance on the conflict, with his Democratic party starting its national convention on Monday amid pro-Palestinian protests and worries about Muslim and Arab American votes in swing states. However, with the Palestinian Islamist group announcing a resumption of suicide bombing inside Israel after many years, and claiming responsibility for a blast in Tel Aviv on Sunday night, and medics saying Israeli military strikes killed at least 30 Palestinians across the Gaza Strip on Monday, there are few signs of conciliation on the ground and fears of wider war. In a very constructive meeting with Prime Minister Netanyahu today, he confirmed to me that Israel accepts the bridging proposal - that he supports it, Blinken told reporters in Tel Aviv. Its now incumbent on Hamas to do the same, and then the parties, with the help of the mediators - the United States, Egypt and Qatar - have to come together and complete the process of reaching clear understandings about how theyll implement the commitments that theyve made under this agreement. DIFFICULT NEGOTIATIONS Despite U.S. expressions of optimism and Netanyahus office describing the meeting as positive, both Israel and Hamas have signalled that any deal will be difficult. Months of on-off talks have circled the same issues, with Israel saying the war can only end with the destruction of Hamas as a military and political force and Hamas saying it will only accept a permanent, not temporary, ceasefire. There are disagreements over Israels continued military presence inside Gaza, particularly along the border with Egypt, the free movement of Palestinians inside the territory, and the identity and number of prisoners to be freed in a swap. Hamas officials accused Washington of favouring Israel. When Blinken says that the Israelis agreed and then the Israelis say that there is an updated proposal, this means that the Americans are subject to Israeli pressure and not the other way around. We believe that it is a manoeuvre that gives the Israelis more time, senior Hamas official Osama Hamdan told Reuters. The current war in Gaza began on Oct. 7, 2023, when Hamas gunmen stormed into Israeli communities, killing around 1,200 people and abducting about 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies. Israels military has since levelled swathes of the Palestinian enclave, driving nearly all of its 2.3 million people from their homes, giving rise to deadly hunger and disease and killing at least 40,000 people, according to Palestinian health authorities. PHILADELPHIA CORRIDOR Blinken, on his ninth trip to the region since the war began, met Israeli President Isaac Herzog and Netanyahu on Monday. He later met Defence Minister Yoav Gallant and is due also to visit Egypt and Qatar in the coming days. Egyptian security sources said further ceasefire talks in Cairo this week were contingent on agreement over a security mechanism for the so-called Philadelphia Corridor between Egypt and Gaza. The U.S. has proposed an international presence in the area, a suggestion that could be acceptable if it was limited to a maximum of six months, the sources said. In Israel, families of hostages - who have staged protests urging a deal - spoke out again on Monday. Dont sacrifice my daughter and the dozens of helpless hostages, said Ayelet Levy-Shachar on Kan Radio. Her daughter Naama, 20, was captured at an army base. Some at a protest in Tel Aviv held U.S. flags and signs saying Hostage deal now, Hey Joe! Mr Biden, help us save them, and They have no time. Inside Gaza, Palestinians said they had little optimism that Blinkens visit would bring a ceasefire. They are lying just to destroy us more and more. Kill us and kill our children, starve us and make us homeless. Blinken is useless, his visit will harm the Palestinian people, said Hanan Abu Hamid, who was displaced from her home in Rafah. The conflict has put the entire Middle East region on edge, triggering months of border clashes between Israel and Lebanons Iran-backed Hezbollah movement, and threatening a wider escalation drawing in major powers.

        "content": "The reports of diseases such as childhood asthma have increased these days, according to the Consultant Paediatrician of Lady Ridgeway Hospital for Children Dr. Deepal Perera. He further stated that there is an increase in the influenza cases being reported over the past couple of days. He noted that if a child exhibits symptoms such as a cough and difficulty in breathing, it could be a sign of asthma. According to him, both influenza and various viral fevers are currently spreading and, particularly the fever is affecting the upper respiratory tract. He added that the situation could likely worsen. Therefore, if a child has a cough, cold or fever it is advisable to keep the child at home, said the Consultant Paediatrician. He further advised that if children are showing such symptoms they should wear a mask and urged parents to be extra cautious about the potential increase in asthma and respiratory diseases among children. Coughing occurring mainly during the night might be a sign of childhood asthma, warned Dr. Deepal. He also noted that if a cough is accompanied by chest pain and fever, it is important to keep an eye on the fever, as it could potentially develop into pneumonia while emphasizing the importance to check whether the illness might be affecting the lower respiratory tract and upper respiratory tract due to the prevailing cold climatic conditions.",

        "date": "August 20, 2024 02:53 pm",
        "content": "Specialist divers on Tuesday launched a fresh search for six people, including UK tech tycoon Mike Lynch and the chairman of Morgan Stanley International, missing since their yacht capsized off the Italian island of Sicily. The British-flagged Bayesian, which had 22 people aboard including 10 crew, was anchored some 700 metres from port before dawn Monday when it was struck by a waterspout, a sort of mini tornado. Fifteen people aboard, including a mother with a one-year-old baby, were plucked to safety; one man has been found dead; and six people remain missing. On Tuesday, three divers strapped on oxygen bottles and began their descent to the wreck, some 50 metres below the sea surface. Most of those aboard the yacht were British, and the passengers were guests of Lynch, celebrating his recent acquittal in a massive US fraud case, according to Italian media. Lynchs wife Angela Bacares was among 15 people rescued, but the businessman and his 18-year-old daughter Hannah were missing, according to Salvo Cocina, head of the Civil Protection Agency in Sicily. The chair of Morgan Stanley International, Jonathan Bloomer, who testified for Lynch, was also missing alongside his wife, Judy, the UK insurer Hiscox said on Tuesday. Bloomer is also the chair of Hiscox, which issued a statement saying it was deeply shocked and saddened by the incident. Christopher Morvillo of law firm Clifford Chance, who represented Lynch, had also been on the boat along with his wife, media reports said. Lynch, 59, is a celebrated technology sector entrepreneur and investor, sometimes referred to as the UKs answer to Bill Gates. Lynch was acquitted on all charges in a San Francisco court in early June after he was accused of an 11 billion fraud linked to the sale of his software firm Autonomy to Hewlett-Packard. - Access limited  Divers trained to work in tight spaces were flown in from Rome and Sardinia late Monday, but a first, nighttime search of the wreck failed. Access was limited only to the bridge, with difficulty due to the presence of furniture obstructing passage, the fire service said on X. The 56-metre (180-foot) long luxury vessel was moored off Porticello, east of Palermo, when violent winds and rains suddenly swept up the coast. It was terrible. The boat was hit by really strong wind and shortly after it went down, survivor Charlotte Golunski told ANSA news agency. Golunski, board director at Luminance, a company founded by Lynch, lost hold of her one-year-old daughter in the waves for two seconds, before managing to grab her while the sea raged. Lots of people were screaming in the dark, said Golunski, who managed to get on a life raft. A waterspout is a column that descends from a cloud to form a rotating mixture of wind and water over a body of water, often during severe thunderstorms. - Mast snapped  Just a few hours later, the seas were calm as divers recovered a body, reported to be the yachts chef. They also spotted a body inside the sunken vessel, a source close to the recovery operation said. The Bayesian was a superyacht built by the Italian shipbuilding firm Perini Navi in 2008 which boasted a 75-metre mast, the tallest aluminium sailing mast in the world, according to the Charter World website. A photograph posted on social media Monday by the Baia Santa Nicolicchia bar in Porticello showed the yacht all lit up, its towering mast shining in the darkness, just a few hours before the storm hit. Karsten Borner, the captain of another yacht anchored nearby at the time of the storm, said there was a very strong hurricane gust and he had to battle to keep his vessel steady. He saw the Bayesians mast bend and then snap, according to Italys Corriere della Sera daily. Italian authorities have opened a probe into the incident. Source: AFP --Agencies",

        "title": "Sri Lankas LTL Holdings and Indias Petronet ink MoU for LNG supply to Sobadhanavi plant",
        "date": "August 20, 2024 04:21 pm",
        "content": "A significant milestone in Sri Lankas energy sector unfolded today (20) with the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between LTL Holdings Limited of Sri Lanka and Petronet LNG Limited of India, for the development of infrastructure for the storage, regasification and supply of Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) for the Sobadhanavi Combined Cycle Power Plant in Kerawalapitiya. The signing ceremony took place this evening at the Galadari Hotel, Colombo with the Chief Executive Officer of LTL Holdings Limited Mr. Nuhuman Marikkar and Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director of Petronet LNG Company Mr. Akshay Kumar Singh signing the agreement on behalf of their respective organizations. Speaking at the event, Minister of Power and Energy Kanchana Wijesekera highlighted that this initiative is a key part of President Ranil Wickremesinghes broader energy strategy. The initiative aims to ensure a continuous and high-quality electricity supply at a minimal cost, ultimately benefiting consumers across Sri Lanka. The partnership between LTL Holdings and Petronet LNG Limited represents a significant step in Sri Lankas efforts to modernize its energy infrastructure, reduce dependence on traditional fuel sources, and transition toward a more sustainable and cost-effective energy future. Minister Wijesekera noted that, despite the governments difficult policy decisions regarding electricity tariffs over the past two years, the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) has become a debt-free, robust institution. This financial stability has attracted new agreements and encouraged both local and foreign investment in the energy sector. As an interim solution for LNG supply to the Sobadhanavi Power Plant, the partnership has devised a technical arrangement to import LNG from Petronets terminal in Kochi, India, using cryogenic ISO containers. Once the LNG arrives at Colombo Port, it will be transported in ISO containers to the Kerawalapitiya storage and regasification terminal, which will be constructed adjacent to the Sobadhanavi plant. The first phase of the Sobadhanavi plant is set to be commissioned in August 2024, with the second phase scheduled for the first quarter of 2025. Developed and operated by Lakdhanavi Limited, the power development arm of LTL Holdings, the plant will significantly enhance Sri Lankas energy generation capabilities. This project aligns with the governments vision of a sustainable and economically viable energy future, marking considerable progress in the nations clean energy transition. The use of LNG, a cleaner energy source, will play a crucial role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions, helping Sri Lanka meet its environmental targets. Additionally, the cost efficiency of LNG is expected to lower power generation costs, provide economic relief to consumers, and support the countrys broader economic growth. Miniter Kanchana Wijesekara further elaborated: During the last energy crisis, recognizing the urgent need for electricity in the country, various proposals were discussed to address the crisis and reduce costs, particularly through the use of Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG). As a result, in March of last year, when a delegation including the Secretary to the Ministry of Natural Gas and Petroleum of the Indian Government visited Sri Lanka, an initial proposal for this project was presented. Following that proposal, the agreement was signed today, marking the culmination of several months of discussions. Within 18 months from now, we aim to deliver the benefits to the people of this country, with the necessary infrastructure development and the supply of LNG to the existing power plant system of the LTL Group, which has already been completed. Once electricity generation using LNG begins, it will be possible to reduce electricity costs in the country. Power plants running on LNG can reduce costs by at least 40 to 50. We plan to pass on these savings to consumers, thereby lowering energy costs in Sri Lanka. It is important to acknowledge, however, that this is not an easy task. We aim to commence power generation activities at the Yugadhanavi and Sobadhanavi power plants at the beginning of 2026. However, the Sobadhanavi plant is expected to be operational by August 28. The reason for this timeline is the need to run the power plants on diesel and fuel oil during the first year before transitioning to natural liquefied gas for power generation. As a result of signing these agreements today, electricity consumers in Sri Lanka will experience significant benefits in the future. This initiative not only offers financial advantages but also helps reduce environmental damage. We have established a policy to phase out the use of diesel, crude oil, and naphtha. Our plan is to meet 70 of the countrys electricity needs through renewable energy, while the remaining 30 will be supplied using LNG. We are working to create the necessary infrastructure to integrate renewable energy into the electricity grid. Over the past two years, weve faced tough decisions, such as increasing electricity tariff. We had to choose between allowing 16-hour power cuts or ensuring a continuous electricity supply while managing costs. Ultimately, we prioritized consistent power delivery, even if it meant making challenging adjustments to pricing. Even a few hours of a power cut can cause significant damage to the economy and disrupt peoples lives, as we all know from experience. By 2022, the Electricity Board had incurred a loss of Rs. 300 billion, which included loans from two state banks and payments due to suppliers. By introducing a fee system that reflects those costs, we have managed to repay a large portion of the bank loans. Additionally, all payments owed to the suppliers operating the power plants have now been settled. It is also worth noting that we were able to pay off all the debts of the CPC due to the difficult but necessary decisions we made. As a result, we can now reach such agreements and encourage both local and foreign investors to make new investments. Through these efforts, we aim to provide electricity to the people of this country at the lowest possible cost while ensuring a continuous and high-quality electricity supply. My sincere thanks go to everyone who contributed to this achievement. Deputy High Commissioner of India to Sri Lanka HE Dr. Satyanjal Pandey: Ensuring a reliable, cleaner, and sustainable energy supply is crucial for driving growth and enhancing the quality of life for all citizens. Our joint efforts focus on bolstering energy security in Sri Lanka and reducing energy costs, which serve as key drivers of economic development. Connecting Sri Lanka to emerging regional and global grids, with India as a major transit point, can attract investments to unlock Sri Lankas vast green energy potential, generate additional revenue, and position the country as a major energy exporter. Our current initiatives include the power grid connectivity, infrastructure connections, and a multi-product pipeline, for which discussions are advanced and ongoing. We are also investing in renewable energy projects, such as the solar power project in Sampoor. Both governments are working closely to swiftly turn these shared aspirations into reality. The signing of todays MOU underscores our continued commitment to building on the strong foundation of our bilateral relationship by collaborating in areas essential to our energy needs and the future prosperity of our people. The event was attended by Secretary of the Ministry of Power and Energy Dr. Sulaksha Jayawardena, Chairman of LTL Holdings Limited U.D. Jayawardena, Chairman of the Ceylon Electricity Board Nalinda Ilangakoon, Chairman of the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation Saliya Wickramasuriya along with other ministry officials, government representatives, investors, board members of the two respective companies, and other distinguished guests. --PMD",

The families of Yagev Buchshtab, Alexander Dancyg, Avraham Munder, Yoram Metzger, Nadav Popplewell, and Chaim Perry have been informed, the statements added. The Hostages Families Forum, an organisation that represents most hostage families, welcomed the news but renewed its call on the government to conclude a hostage release deal with the Gaza-based Palestinian militant group Hamas. The immediate return of the remaining 109 hostages can only be achieved through a negotiated deal. The Israeli government, with the assistance of mediators, must do everything in its power to finalise the deal currently on the table, it said.

        "date": "August 20, 2024 06:13 pm",
        "content": "A group of authors is suing artificial intelligence startup Anthropic, alleging it committed large-scale theft in training its popular chatbot Claude on pirated copies of copyrighted books. While similar lawsuits have piled up for more than a year against competitor OpenAI, maker of ChatGPT, this is the first from writers to target Anthropic and its Claude chatbot. The smaller San Francisco-based company  founded by ex-OpenAI leaders  has marketed itself as the more responsible and safety-focused developer of generative AI models that can compose emails, summarize documents and interact with people in a natural way. But the lawsuit filed Monday in a federal court in San Francisco alleges that Anthropics actions have made a mockery of its lofty goals by tapping into repositories of pirated writings to build its AI product. It is no exaggeration to say that Anthropics model seeks to profit from strip-mining the human expression and ingenuity behind each one of those works, the lawsuit says. Anthropic didnt immediately respond to a request for comment Monday. The lawsuit was brought by a trio of writers  Andrea Bartz, Charles Graeber and Kirk Wallace Johnson  who are seeking to represent a class of similarly situated authors of fiction and nonfiction. While its the first case against Anthropic from book authors, the company is also fighting a lawsuit by major music publishers alleging that Claude regurgitates the lyrics of copyrighted songs. The authors case joins a growing number of lawsuits filed against developers of AI large language models in San Francisco and New York. OpenAI and its business partner Microsoft are already battling a group of copyright infringement cases led by household names like John Grisham, Jodi Picoult and Game of Thrones novelist George R. R. Martin; and another set of lawsuits from media outlets such as The New York Times, Chicago Tribune and Mother Jones. What links all the cases is the claim that tech companies ingested huge troves of human writings to train AI chatbots to produce human-like passages of text, without getting permission or compensating the people who wrote the original works. The legal challenges are coming not just from writers but visual artists, music labels and other creators who allege that generative AI profits have been built on misappropriation. Anthropic and other tech companies have argued that training of AI models fits into the fair use doctrine of U.S. laws that allows for limited uses of copyrighted materials such as for teaching, research or transforming the copyrighted work into something different. But the lawsuit against Anthropic accuses it of using a dataset called The Pile that included a trove of pirated books. It also disputes the idea that AI systems are learning the way humans do. Humans who learn from books buy lawful copies of them, or borrow them from libraries that buy them, providing at least some measure of compensation to authors and creators, the lawsuit says.

        "date": "August 20, 2024 09:46 pm",
        "content": "Former President Maithripala Sirisena has completed the payments of compensation of Rs. 100 million to the victims of the Easter Sunday terror attacks as ordered by the Supreme Court. Accordingly, it is reported that the former President has paid the remaining amount of Rs. 12 million on August 16, thereby completing the total compensation payment ordered by the court. On January 12, 2023, the Supreme Court found that former President Sirisena, former Defence Secretary Hemasiri Fernando, former IGP Pujith Jayasundara, former National Intelligence Chief Sisira Mendis and former Chief of State Intelligence Nilantha Jayawardena have violated the Fundamental Rights of petitioners, by failing to take action to prevent the Easter Sunday attacks despite receiving sufficient intelligence information. As a result, they were ordered to pay compensation to the victims of the Easter Sunday attacks, Ada Derana reporter said. Accordingly, the Supreme Court ordered former President Sirisena to pay Rs. 100 million in compensation to the petitioners, former IGP Pujith Jayasundara and the former SIS Director Nilantha Jayawardena were each ordered to pay Rs. 75 million, former Defense Secretary Hemasiri Fernando was ordered to pay Rs. 50 million and former National Intelligence Director Sisira Mendis was ordered to pay Rs. 10 million from their personal money. In addition, the judgment also stated that the government should pay Rs. 01 million in compensation to the victims. The order was issued by a seven-member Supreme Court Judge bench, delivering its decision with regard to the 12 petitions filed by various parties stating that their fundamental rights were violated by the defendants negligence and failure to prevent the terrorist attacks on April 21, 2019. The 12 petitions were filed by a group of individuals including Nandana Sirimanna, whose two children were killed in the Easter Sunday attacks, tourism entrepreneur Janath Vidanage, three Catholic Fathers including Rev. Fr. Sarath Iddamalgoda and Attorney-at-Law Moditha Ekanayake, who was injured in the bombings at the Shangri-La Hotel. On July 15, the Supreme Court had ordered former President Sirisena, former Inspector General of Police (IGP) Pujith Jayasundara and former Chief of State Intelligence Service (SIS) Nilantha Jayawardena, to complete their outstanding compensation payments before August 30, 2024. Furthermore, the seven-member Supreme Court judge panel had ordered that if the relevant individuals fail to complete the payments before the said date, contempt of court charges will be filed against them before September 20, 2024. The former Presidents lawyers had informed the Supreme Court on the same day that Rs. 58 million of the total Rs. 100 million in compensation, which Sirisena had been ordered to pay the victims, had already been paid. Meanwhile, the former President had also requested the court through his lawyers to extend the payment period for the remaining sum by six years. However, this request was rejected by the court which extended the deadline to August 30. On July 11, 2023, the former President completed paying Rs. 15 million as part of the compensation he was ordered to pay to the victims and filed a motion requesting that he be allowed to pay the remaining sum in 10 instalments of Rs. 8.5 million from 30 June 2024 to 20 June 2033. The deadline to complete the relevant compensation payments was initially set for July 12, 2023.",

Titled Central Asia Forum: A Gateway to New Horizons, the Colombo event will be opened by Sri Lankan Foreign Secretary Aruni Wijewardane with Foreign Minister Ali Sabry also scheduled to deliver an address, highlighting Sri Lankas priorities in the region. With its strategic location, Central Asia is poised to play an important role in the future of Eurasian connectivity. The event is expected to offer perspectives and insights that will shape the future of Sri Lankas engagement with the region, the Sri Lankan Foreign Ministry said in a statement. The forum will also delve into the opportunities and challenges that lie ahead, with a special focus on building synergies that can drive mutual growth and prosperity. The Sri Lankan Foreign Ministry said that the forum is being held following a recent decision to establish a resident diplomatic mission of Sri Lanka in Kazakhstan and the conclusion of Foreign Office consultations with Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Turkmenistan. The event will bring together policymakers, thought leaders, business persons and experts including Kazakhstans former Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Doulat Kuanyshev, Norwegian diplomat and Geopolitical Cartographer Council member Erik Solheim, Deputy Head of Mission of the Kazakhstan Embassy in New Delhi Darkhan Seitenov, and many other experts. In September 2023, during a high-level meeting between the Sri Lankan President Ranil Wickremesinghe and Kazakhstan President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, it was agreed to reciprocally establish Embassies in Colombo and Astana. The embassy in Astana will be Sri Lankas first resident diplomatic mission in Central Asia. Sri Lanka is also a Member of Conference on Confidence Building Measures in Asia (CICA) based in Astana. Both countries have acknowledged that the resumption of direct charter flights by Air Astana to Sri Lanka has contributed to increasing tourist arrivals from Kazakhstan to Sri Lanka and are exploring a reciprocal visa-free arrangement for normal passport holders.

He took oaths before Speaker Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena following the commencement of the parliamentary proceedings at 9.30 a.m. today. On 09 August 2024, the Supreme Court determined that the Samagi Jana Balawegayas (SJB) decision to expel then Galle District Member of Parliament Manusha Nanayakkara and the National List Member of Parliament Harin Fernando from the party is legally valid. As a result, the two Parliamentary seats became vacant. The Supreme Court declared this ruling while dismissing the petitions filed by Harin Fernando and Manusha Nanayakkkara challenging the SJBs decision to remove them from their party membership. On July 18, 2023, the Working Committee of the SJB decided to expel party members Harin Fernando and Manusha Nanayakkara from the party. In May 2022, the SJB had suspended the party membership of the two parliamentarians after they had accepted ministerial portfolios in the government while the party had vowed to take disciplinary action against them. However, the General Secretary of Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) Ranjith Madduma Bandara had stated that party member Bandula Lal Bandarigoda will be appointed fill the parliamentary seat which fell vacant following the suspension of the party membership of Manusha Nanayakkara through the Supreme Court ruling. Bandarigoda, who secured 34,897 votes and placed third from the Galle District in 2020 General Election, was next in line on the SJBs preferential vote list. Meanwhile, the SJB General Secretary had also said a qualified individual will be named by the party to fill the MP seat which remains vacant as Harin Fernando was also disqualified to hold the MP seat due to the suspension of his party membership, since Fernando was elected to the Parliament through SJBs national list.",

        "date": "August 21, 2024 10:04 am",
        "content": "After a relationship that spanned two decades, two engagements, two weddings and headlines too numerous to count, Jennifer Lopez has filed for divorce from Ben Affleck. The filing Tuesday in Los Angeles brought to an apparent end a celebrity coupling or at least the second installment of it that dazzled from the very heights of the pop culture firmament and emblazoned countless tabloid covers. The pair became known, even before such power-couple portmanteaus were ubiquitous, as Bennifer. Court records showed Lopez filed the petition Tuesday in Los Angeles Superior Court. The news was first reported by the TMZ website. TMZ reported further that Lopez listed the date of separation as April 26, 2024. It added that she did not mention any prenuptial agreement. After meeting, falling in love and getting engaged in the early 2000s and starring together in 2003s infamous Gigli and 2004s Jersey Girl the couple parted ways, blaming in part the pressure of the public eye. Love is beautiful. Love is kind. And it turns out love is patient. Twenty years patient, wrote Lopez, announcing their first, quickie Las Vegas wedding that July, and signing off as Jennifer Lynn Affleck. Stick around long enough and maybe youll find the best moment of your life in a drive through in Las Vegas at 12:30 in the morning in the tunnel of love drive through with your kids and the one youll spend forever with, she wrote in her newsletter. The couple had flown to Las Vegas, lined up with their license with four other couples and were wed just after midnight at A Little White Wedding Chapel, where Lopez said a Bluetooth speaker played their brief march down the aisle. She called it the best night of the couples lives. A month later, they had a much grander wedding at Afflecks house in Georgia, in front of friends and family. Both of them had been previously married. Affleck, 52, married Jennifer Garner, with whom he shares three children, in 2005. They divorced in 2018. Lopez, 55, had been married three times before. She was briefly married to Ojani Noa from 1997-1998 and to Cris Judd from 2001-2003. She and singer Marc Anthony were married for a decade, having wed in 2004, and share 14-year-old twins. She started dating former baseball player Alex Rodriguez in 2017, but the couple called off their engagement in 2021. All along, it had been Lopez who was more vocal in describing her and Afflecks journey. When asked earlier this year whether she was harder on herself because her relationships had been so high-profile, Lopez agreed. Oh yeah. 100. Its made me doubt myself and really feel bad about myself at times. Made me feel like I wanted to quit at times. But at the end of the day, I feel like you kind of have to do this thing where you learn how to navigate it, she told The Associated Press. You take the things that could be constructive about that and use it, and the rest you kind of just throw away as kind of like haterations or, you know, other things like that and just be like, Whatever. I know who I am, I know what I want to do. Affleck himself expressed admiration for her self-possession, telling the AP last year that he agreed with the idea that Hollywood was unsure how to capitalize on her wide-ranging talent. I think shes in her prime, Affleck said then. Shes doing extraordinary work in large measure because shes taking that step to take responsibility for what shes doing rather than say, This is what Im being offered.  Lopez is starring in the upcoming Unstoppable, under Affleck and Matt Damons Artists Equity banner. In May, she starred in the Netflix movie Atlas. At the end of the month, she suddenly canceled her 2024 North American tour, saying she was heartsick and devastated to be letting fans down but the move was necessary. Jennifer is taking time off to be with her children, family and close friends, organizers said in a statement. The tour was to be her first in five years, in support of her first solo album in a decade, This Is Me.... Now and its companion film. a fictionalized look at her long love life, and a documentary. When I was a girl theyd ask me what Id be. A woman in love is what I grew up wantin to be, Lopez sang on the title track. The album, she said, was inspired by her rekindled relationship with Affleck. But the film was more about your journey as a person, its about one persons journey and what it takes to get from heartbreak back to love. Or a hopeless romantics journey in their search for love. In the movie, she played a character called The Artist who, similarly, had decided as a child what she wanted to be when she grew up: in love. But the road was rocky. In an early scene, The Artist is on the back of a motorcycle, riding across a beach, with a hunky man, face shielded. Then the motorcycle crashes. Not all love stories have a happy ending, she says.

The crash happened Tuesday night in the central Iranian province of Yazd, said Mohammad Ali Malekzadeh, a local emergency official, according to the state-run IRNA news agency.

Pilgrims gather in Karbala, Iraq, in whats regarded as the largest annual public gathering in the world. Authorities offered no immediate cause for the crash. However, Iran has one of the worlds worst traffic safety records with some 17,000 deaths annually.

She made the announcement while delivering a statement in Parliament today (21). Thalatha Athukorala, the sister of the late United National Party (UNP) politician Gamini Athukorala, first entered Parliament in 2004. She has been re-elected in subsequent general elections in 2010, 2015, and 2020 from the Ratnapura District.

Delivering her special statement in parliament today, Athukorala said the following: This is a very emotional moment for me. On one side, our mother party - the United National Party has split into two. Both the leader and former deputy leader of that party have become political enemies. Both are vying to become president. At a time when everyone is trying to unite, I cannot wholeheartedly agree with the decision for our camp to divide and contest separately. I believe that the decision for the two leaders to separate and contest is a selfish political decision taken without thinking about the future of the country. History will prove that in the near future. If I continue to remain silent about it, I will also become an indirect contributor to that sin. I will never stop my political journey and I will say that with pride and courage at this moment. I have no regrets of leaving my position as an MP. Today, I am facing that crucial moment and this is the first time I am informing this to the parliament. I do not wish for the party to split even though I won as a candidate of the Samagi Jana Balawegaya, I still continue to think whether the decision we took back then without thinking about the future was the correct decision. The thought of whether I contributed to the division of our great party makes me feel sadder than the happiness of the MP position I gained.",

        "date": "August 21, 2024 02:49 pm",
        "content": "Amid nationwide protests in India over the brutal rape and murder of a Kolkata doctor, two young female students from a school in Maharashtras Badlapur were allegedly sexually assaulted, leading to widespread public outrage. The situation escalated on Tuesday when protesters, angry over the alleged police inaction, blocked train services at the Badlapur railway station, prompting the police to resort to lathicharge to disperse the crowd. The protest was ignited after news of the alleged sexual abuse spread, with hundreds of people gathering to demand swift action against the accused and justice for the victims. In response to the growing unrest, the Maharashtra government announced the formation of a Special Investigation Team (SIT) to probe the incident. State Cabinet Minister Girish Mahajan, who attempted to pacify the protesters, assured them of strict action against those responsible, stating, The accused person will face the most severe punishment. Mahajan, a close ally of Deputy Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis, revealed that immediate orders had been issued for the suspension of three police officials at the Badlapur police station after the family members of the victims were reportedly made to wait for 11 hours to register the FIR. Deputy Chief Minister and Home Minister Devendra Fadnavis, speaking to reporters in Mumbai, said that the SIT will be headed by an IG-rank woman officer and the case will be heard in a fast track court. In the Badlapur unfortunate incident, IG Rank officer IPS Arti Singh is appointed immediately to conduct the enquiry. Chargesheet will be immediately filed and this matter will be heard in the fasttrack court. Our Police Dept will take complete efforts to get such barbaric inhuman punished immediately, he asserted. He expressed the governments commitment to ensuring justice for the victims and accountability for any lapses in police conduct. The delay in police action has also sparked a political outcry. Opposition leader Vijay Wadettiwar criticised the police for allegedly making the victims parents wait for 11 hours to file a complaint. In a video message, he compared the severity of the incident to the rape and murder of a trainee doctor in Kolkata, which had drawn nationwide attention. Atrocities are committed on a three-and-a-half-year-old girl and a four-year-old girl, and at the police station, their parents are made to wait for 11 hours when they seek to file a complaint Is there any sensitivity left? I spoke to the police commissioner and told him that the woman police officer responsible for this delay must be suspended immediately, Wadettiwar added. Source: ANN --Agencies",

        "date": "August 21, 2024 04:53 pm",
        "content": "An ambitious plan to build a massive solar farm in remote northern Australia that would transmit energy by submarine cable to Singapore is a step closer after the Australian government granted environmental approvals for the 30 billion Australian dollar (19 billion) project Wednesday. Australian company Sun Cable plans to build a 12,400-hectare solar farm and transport electricity to the northern Australian city of Darwin via an 800-kilometer (497-mile) overhead transmission line, then on to large-scale industrial customers in Singapore through a 4,300-kilometer (2,672-mile) submarine cable. The Australia-Asia PowerLink project aims to deliver up to six gigawatts of green electricity each year, which according to Australian Environment Minister Tanya Plibersek will help turn Australia into a renewable energy superpower and boost its economy. This massive project is a generation-defining piece of infrastructure, Plibersek said in a written statement on Wednesday. It will be the largest solar precinct in the world  and heralds Australia as the world leader in green energy. The project was initially backed by Australian mining magnate Andrew Forrest and Atlassian co-founder Mike Cannon-Brookes. The plans were highlighted during a state visit by then Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong and Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese as part of a  Green Economy  agreement in 2022. In January 2023, the project collapsed when Sun Cable entered voluntary administration due to a funding dispute between Forrest and Cannon-Brookes. By May of that year, a consortium led by Cannon-Brookes Grok Ventures acquired the company, finalizing the takeover in September 2023. SunCable Australias managing director Cameron Garnsworthy said it was pleased to have cleared a major regulatory hurdle and will now focus its efforts on the next stage of planning to advance the project towards a Final Investment Decision targeted by 2027. The company said electricity supply would commence in the early 2030s. Energy has been a politically charged issue for nearly two decades in Australia, which is reliant on coal and gas as well as royalties from exporting those fuels to help underpin its economy. This reliance on fossil fuels has historically made it one of the worlds worst greenhouse gas emitters on a per capita basis. Australias main opposition party in June announced plans to build the countrys first nuclear power plants as early as 2035, ensuring the major parties will be divided on how Australia curbs its greenhouse gas emissions at elections due within a year. The parties havent gone to an election with the same carbon reduction policies since 2007. Australians have a choice between a renewable energy transition thats already underway creating jobs and driving down prices; or paying for an expensive nuclear fantasy that may never happen, Plibersek said.

        "date": "August 22, 2024 08:28 am",
        "content": "Sri Lankas dollar bonds are drifting lower on investor concern that the completion of a debt restructuring agreement with creditors could be pushed back by next months presidential election. The countrys dollar bonds due in 2030 traded below 55 cents on the dollar on Wednesday, down from 59 cents in mid June. This month, Sri Lanka has the worst performing emerging-market debt following Lebanon, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg. Sri Lanka struck a preliminary deal with private investors in July to restructure 12.6 billion of bonds  an agreement which needs to gain backing of the International Monetary Fund and bilateral creditors such as China and France. A month later, the South Asian nations government requested more details regarding the IMFs assessment of the proposed debt revamp. Sri Lankan bonds have under-performed other defaulted bonds, probably due to uncertainty about the timing of the bond exchange and political uncertainty about the upcoming elections, said Carlos de Sousa, an emerging market debt portfolio manager at Vontobel Asset Management. A gauge of Sri Lankas dollar bonds has dropped 1.6 this month, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. So far this year, however, the sovereigns debt has returned 9.7, outperforming the flagship Bloomberg Emerging Markets Hard Currency Aggregate Index, which is up 6.2. Continued Discussions Sri Lanka is in continued discussions on the debt restructuring process, Junior Finance Minister Shehan Semasinghe said in a message to Bloomberg News. The government has received an initial assessment from its Official Creditor Committee on the comparability of treatment in relation to the deal signed with bondholders in July and is currently awaiting further details. Once these have been received, it will be possible to engage further with bondholders on the basis of the information provided by these assessments and conclude the process, he said, without specifying any time period for the final agreement. The creditor group from the July agreement declined to comment. The Asian island nation of 22 million will vote in a presidential election on Sept. 21 as incumbent Ranil Wickremesinghe seeks a mandate for his fiscal reforms as Sri Lanka seeks to shore up its economy after a default in 2022. The IMF is vetting the restructuring deal to ensure it fits into the debt parameters of its 3 billion loan to the country. There is much unclarity about the debt deal amid concern over whether it treats all creditors fairly, especially as bilateral lenders are often reluctant to make their borrowing details public. The deal with private bondholders envisaged a 28 nominal reduction on the bonds principal, and the issuance of the so-called macro-linked bonds, whose payouts are linked to economic growth. Barclays Plc analyst Avanti Save said theres little time to prepare the debt deal before next months ballot, although she doesnt rule out that an agreement could still be reached ahead of the vote. Bonds are down as clear either the IMF or the official creditors dont agree with the deal, said Thys Louw, a portfolio manager at Ninety One UK Ltd. I think the deal doesnt get done until after the election. Source: Bloomberg --Agencies",

        "date": "August 22, 2024 08:45 am",
        "content": "U.S. President Joe Biden, in a phone call with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday, stressed the urgent need to conclude a Gaza ceasefire-for-hostages deal and pointed to upcoming Cairo talks as crucial, the White House said. Their call followed U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinkens whirlwind trip to the Middle East that ended on Tuesday without an agreement between Israel and Hamas militants on a truce in the Palestinian enclave. Negotiators who have struggled for months to conclude a ceasefire deal plan to meet in the coming days in Cairo. The president stressed the urgency of bringing the ceasefire and hostage release deal to closure and discussed upcoming talks in Cairo to remove any remaining obstacles, a White House statement about the call said. The statement said Biden and Netanyahu also discussed U.S. efforts to support Israel against all threats from Iran, including its proxy terrorist groups Hamas, Hezbollah, and the Houthis, to include ongoing defensive U.S. military deployments. Iran has vowed retaliation over the killing of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran on July 31, which it blamed on Israel. Israel has neither confirmed nor denied that it was behind the killing. The United States has ordered a guided missile submarine be deployed to the Middle East and ordered the Abraham Lincoln strike group to accelerate its deployment to the region to be on hand to bolster Israels defense. Blinken and mediators from Egypt and Qatar have pinned their hopes on a U.S. bridging proposal aimed at narrowing the gaps between the two sides in the 10-month-old Gaza war. President Biden spoke with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel to discuss the ceasefire and hostage release deal and diplomatic efforts to de-escalate regional tensions, a White House statement said earlier. Vice President Kamala Harris, who on Thursday in Chicago will formally accept the nomination as the Democrats presidential candidate for the Nov. 5 election, also joined the call. Biden, who is vacationing at an 8,000-acre ranch in the Santa Ynez Valley of California, had been expected to press Netanyahu to soften a new Israeli demand that it be allowed to keep forces along a land corridor between Egypt and Gaza, a U.S. official said before the call. Netanyahus office on Wednesday denied an Israeli television report that the country had agreed to withdraw its troops from the so-called Philadelphi corridor, a narrow 14.5-km-long (nine-mile-long) stretch of land along the coastal enclaves southern border with Egypt. Getting a Gaza ceasefire deal is a major priority for Biden. A senior U.S. official on Friday described the talks as close to a deal but a final agreement has been agonizingly elusive. In talks to halt fighting in the 10-month-old war, Hamas is seeking a complete Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, including the Philadelphi corridor. Israel wants to retain control of the corridor, which it captured in late May, after destroying dozens of tunnels beneath it that it says had served to smuggle in weapons to Gazas militant groups.

        "date": "August 22, 2024 09:29 am",
        "content": "Divers searching the wreck of a superyacht that sank off Sicily found the bodies of five passengers Wednesday, leaving one still missing as questions intensified about why the vessel sank so quickly when a nearby sailboat remained largely unscathed. Rescue crews brought four body bags ashore at Porticello. Salvatore Cocina, head of the Sicily civil protection agency, said a fifth body had been located. Divers on-scene said they would try to recover it on Thursday while continuing the search for the sixth. The discovery made clear the operation to search the hull on the seabed 50 meters (164 feet) underwater had quickly turned into a recovery one, not a rescue, given the amount of time that had passed and with no signs of life over three days of searching. The Bayesian, a 56-meter (184-foot) British-flagged yacht, went down in a storm early Monday as it was moored about a kilometer (a half-mile) offshore. Civil protection officials said they believed the ship was struck by a tornado over the water, known as a waterspout. Thomas was born in Canada, according to his cousin David Isaac, but visited his parents homeland of Antigua as a child, and moved permanently to the tiny eastern Caribbean island in his early 20s. Italian officials previously listed Antigua and Canada as the nationality of people on board. The fate of six missing passengers had driven the search effort, including British tech magnate Mike Lynch, his 18-year-old daughter and associates who had successfully defended him in a recent U.S. federal fraud trial. Lynchs spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment Wednesday. Meanwhile, Termini Imerese Public Prosecutors Office investigators were acquiring evidence for their criminal investigation, which they opened immediately after the tragedy despite no formal suspects having been publicly identified. Questions have abounded about what caused the superyacht, built in 2008 by Italian shipyard Perini Navi, to rapidly sink, when the nearby Sir Robert Baden Powell sailboat was largely spared and managed to rescue the survivors. Giovanni Costantino, head of The Italian Sea Group, which owns the ship maker, blamed human error for the disaster, which he said took 16 minutes. The ship sank because it took on water. From where, the investigators will say, he told RAI state television after he met with prosecutors. Costantino cited AIS ship tracking data which he said showed the Bayesian had taken on water for four minutes when a sudden gust of wind flipped it and it continued taking on water. The ship straightened up slightly and then went down, he said. But was it merely the case of a freak waterspout that knocked the ship to its side and allowed water to pour in through open hatches? What was the position of the keel, which on a large sailboat like the Bayesian might have been retractable to allow it to enter shallower ports? Theres a lot of uncertainty as to whether it had a lifting keel and whether it might have been up, said Jean-Baptiste Souppez, a fellow of the Royal Institute of Naval Architects and the editor of the Journal of Sailing Technology. But if it had, then that would reduce the amount of stability that the vessel had, and therefore made it easier for it to roll over on its side, he said in an interview. The captain of the sailboat that rescued survivors said his craft sustained minimal damage  the frame of a sun awning broke  even with winds that he estimated reached 12 on the Beaufort wind scale, which is the highest hurricane-strength force on the scale. He said he had remained anchored with his engines running to try to maintain the ships position as the forecast storm rolled in. Another possibility is to heave anchor before the storm and to run downwind at open sea, Karsten Borner said in a text message. But he said that might not have been possible for the Bayesian, given its trademark 75-meter (246-foot) tall mast. If there was a stability problem, caused by the extremely tall mast, it would not have been better at open sea, he said. Yachts like the Bayesian are required to have watertight, sub-compartments that are specifically designed to prevent a rapid, catastrophic sinking even when some parts fill with water. The underwater search continued in dangerous and time-consuming conditions. Because of the wrecks depth, which requires special precautions, divers working in pairs could only spend about 12 minutes at a time searching, though reinforcements outfitted with special equipment to enable longer dives were on the wreck Wednesday. In all, some 27 divers took rotations, including four who helped with recovery after the 2012 Costa Concordia disaster off Tuscany. They called the Porticello wreck a little Concordia, fire crews said in a statement. The limited dive time was aimed in part at avoiding decompression sickness, also known as the bends, which can occur when divers stay underwater for long periods and ascend too quickly, allowing nitrogen gas dissolved in the blood to form bubbles. The longer you stay, the slower your ascent has to be, said Simon Rogerson, the editor of SCUBA magazine. He said the tight turnaround time suggested the operations managers were trying to limit the risks and recovery time after each dive. It sounds like theyre operating essentially on no decompression or very tight decompression, or theyre being extremely conservative, he said. Divers were also working with debris floating around them, limited visibility and air tanks on their backs. We are trying to advance in tight spaces, but any single thing slows us down, said Luca Cari, spokesman for the fire rescue service. An electric panel could set us back for five hours. These arent normal conditions. Were at the limit of possibility. Source: AP --Agencies",

        "date": "August 22, 2024 11:26 am",
        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe cautioned that renegotiating with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), as suggested by some presidential candidates, could lead to the loss of economic gains and trigger another collapse of Sri Lankas economy. The President made these remarks yesterday (21) during a meeting with professionals from the development and construction sectors at the Waters Edge Hotel in Battaramulla. The event, organized under the theme Constructing the Nations Tomorrow, featured a keynote address by Prof. Sirimal Abeyratne. In his speech, President Wickremesinghe stressed the necessity of a stable economy for national progress. He emphasized that the government has already secured all possible concessions by reaching agreements with the IMF, the Asian Development Bank, the World Bank, the Exim Bank of China, and 17 other countries, making further government intervention unnecessary. President Wickremasinghe also highlighted the critical role of the construction and development sector in the countrys economic recovery. Although the sector faced significant challenges due to the suspension of foreign-funded projects during the recent economic crisis, the government has taken steps to ease the burden on construction personnel by providing bank concessions and settling payments owed to contractors. Looking ahead, President Wickremesinghe announced the launch of large-scale hotel development projects in Galle, Kandy, Colombo, and Trincomalee, alongside the establishment of new investment zones in Bingiriya, Jaffna, and Hambantota. He also updated the professionals on ongoing initiatives under the Megapolis Development Plan, which aims to transform Colombo, Galle, and Kandy into major urban centres. President Wickremesinghes remarks reflect his administrations focus on maintaining economic stability and leveraging the construction sector as a driving force for national growth. Addressing the gathering the President elaborated; Friends, you have gathered here today representing a crucial part of our economy: those involved in construction and development, a sector that has been severely impacted by the crisis in Sri Lanka. Its important to remember that we have faced not just one crisis, but two. First, we were hit by COVID-19, and then by the economic breakdown that followed. These events are interconnected, and separating them is difficult. The fiscal measures we took before COVID, such as tax reductions that contradicted our IMF agreements, compounded our challenges by reducing our revenue. Unfortunately, few noticed the warning signs. In our UNP manifesto, we highlighted the looming issue: Sri Lanka needed USD 3 billion to avoid the economic crash. However, this warning was largely ignored, while others made unrealistic promises. The global COVID crisis only worsened our situation, leading to a global economic downturn in 2020 and 2021 that we are still recovering from. As we discuss Sri Lankas situation, consider whats happening globally. In China, real estate development plummeted due to COVID, impacting consumer spending. Even in the USA and Europe, consumer spending fluctuates, and economies are still stabilizing. This global backdrop only adds to our challenges. When I assumed office, I was confident we could turn things around. I was already in touch with the IMF and had discussed the necessary steps with President Gotabaya Rajapaksa. As Professor Sirimal Abeyratne has explained, we have now stabilized the macroeconomy and our debt, ensuring we can service it. Weve also committed to not printing money or borrowing from banks, meaning we must rely on our own revenue hence the higher taxes many of us are paying. The next challenge is to stimulate economic growth. We have a five-year plan, starting from 2022, to return to normalcy. I am hopeful we can achieve this by 2026. Our goal is a 5 annual growth rate by 2027, and this is now enshrined in law under the Economic Transformation Act. Weve also passed other laws, such as the Central Bank Act and the Public Debt Management Act, which provide the foundation for our economic stabilization. Moving forward, the construction and development sector has a vital role to play. Although the sector was hit hard, especially with the collapse of foreign-funded projects, we have taken steps to alleviate the burden, such as preventing banks from closing in on you and clearing backlog payments. As we revive existing projects and attract new foreign and local investments, there will be plenty of opportunities for construction. Were looking at high-rise hotel developments in Galle, Kandy, Colombo, and Trincomalee, and new zones in Bingiriya, Jaffna, and Hambantota. Additionally, the Megapolis Plan will involve significant construction in Colombo, Galle, and Kandy. Theres also a lot of underutilized government land that will be opened up for development. Its up to you to find investors and make the most of these opportunities. Rest assured, there will be ample work for everyone, whether in the state or private sector, and we are addressing concerns like the Payee tax. Together, we must consider how these efforts align with the broader economy and the future of your sector. State Minister for Technology Kanaka Herath; The construction industry is a key driver of economic growth, contributing approximately 7 to our GDP. It also provides livelihood for around 5 million people directly and indirectly, making it one of the largest and the most vital industries in Sri Lanka, where we take the benefits to the grassroots of Sri Lankans. However, the past few years has been exceptionally challenging for the sector. The COVID-19 pandemic followed by the economic crisis struck at the heart of our operations, causing unprecedented destruction. Unlike some other industries, we felt a traumatic impact due to this crisis, leading to a sandstorm of many significant projects. Yet, even in these times, the government has pushed the operations of the industry. Almost 400,000 people have been displaced, Rs. 450 billion worth of payments to contractors were stopped, and I am personally happy to see that the government has managed to clear at least around 400 billion thus far. The economic stability we now experience is a direct result of the bold decisions and steady leadership of the President, Ranil Wickremesinghe. We cannot reset the clock and start all over again. To sustain this momentum, it is crucial that we go through the changes we have witnessed and maintain the political stability that has been so carefully restored. The continued leadership of President Wickremesinghe is the key to our success. Engineer D. Abeysiriwardena, Architect Hirante Welandawe, Veteran City Planner Dr. K. Locana Gunaratne, Senior Advisor to the President on Economic Affairs Dr. R. H. S. Samaratunga, and Chairman of the National Construction Association of Sri Lanka Mr. Darrington Paul, along with President Ranil Wickremesinghe, participated in a panel discussion. During the deliberations, the President provided proactive responses to the questions posed by the professionals in the development and construction industry. The following are the questions raised and the Presidents answers: Question: Mr. President, with your two years of experience in negotiating with the IMF, were now hearing from your esteemed colleague Anura and your buddy Sajith, who claim that if they become president, they intend to renegotiate with the IMF. Could you clarify the potential repercussions our country might face if such a renegotiation were to take place? Answer: Liquidate your companythats all. You need the economy. Weve reached an agreement with the IMF, ADB, World Bank, Export-Import Bank of China, and 17 other countries. This framework, which youve discussed, is what were now negotiating with the sovereign bondholders. Theyve set benchmarks for us. The question is: what exactly are they going to renegotiate? Will they renegotiate the benchmarks, the timeline, or something else? It took us over a year to get this framework approved, so how will they now negotiate with all these countries, especially since China negotiates separately from the Paris Club? We managed to bring India and others into the Paris Club while China coordinated separately, working with the OCC. But now that mechanism isnt necessary anymore because the negotiations are complete. Weve agreed on the relief they can provide. The relief from the Exim Bank differs from what the OCC offers. As for the sovereign bondholders, their relief variessome reduce interest payments, others extend the repayment timeline. If you look at it all together, its like a child with too much food from different places. Will they go through this again? And who will handle itSunil Handunneththi or Harsha De Silva? The event was attended by Minister of Transport, Highways, and Mass Media Bandula Gunawardena, Minister of State Lasantha Alagiyawanna, along with a group of engineers, contractors, and various professionals in the development and construction fields.",

The communications centre of the Armed Forces General Staff, responsible for publishing information on the crash investigation, said the report was completely false, state media reported. A preliminary report by Irans military had said in May that no evidence of foul play or an attack had been found during the investigation. The investigation in the case of Ayatollah Raisis helicopter crash have been completed ... there is complete certainty that what happened was an accident, the security source, who was not named, told Fars. Two reasons for the accident were identified: the weather conditions were unsuitable and the helicopter was unable to handle the weight, leading to it crashing into a mountain, the source added, according to Fars. The investigation indicates that the helicopter was carrying two people more than the capacity that security protocols allow, the source told Fars. Raisi, once a potential successor to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, was killed in the crash in mountainous terrain near the Azerbaijan border. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "date": "August 22, 2024 02:10 pm",
        "content": "A UN Human Rights Office report issued today (22) identified renewed threats to fundamental freedoms in Sri Lanka, evidenced by new or proposed regressive laws, erosion of democratic checks and balances, ongoing threats and intimidation against civil society and journalists, and recurrence of serious human rights violations of the past. As the country approaches presidential and parliamentary elections, it has an opportunity to recommit to the transformational changes demanded by a broad cross-section of Sri Lankans, including accountability and reconciliation, UN Human Rights Chief Volker Türk said. The report points to several laws and bills introduced by the Government since 2023, giving security forces broad powers and significantly expanding pre-existing restrictions on freedoms of expression, opinion and association. This trend is particularly concerning as the country is in an important pre-election period, the High Commissioner said. Authorities have continued to use the Prevention of Terrorism Act to arrest and detain people, despite a promised moratorium, the report says. It also highlights, recent cases of arbitrary arrests and detentions, torture and deaths in custody. The report also details ongoing effects of the 2022 economic crisis and subsequent austerity measures, in particular on the poor, especially women. Decisions on economic policies must be guided by Sri Lankas international human rights obligations, including by ensuring adequate social protection, Türk said. Sri Lankas creditors should provide the Government with the fiscal space needed to realise economic, social and cultural rights. Meanwhile, impunity and lack of accountability persist for crimes committed during and after the civil war that ended in 2009, the report says. The Government elected next month should recommit to address the root causes of conflict and undertake fundamental constitutional and institutional reforms to address the accountability gap and work towards reconciliation, Türk said. Failure of the Sri Lankan State to recognise victims suffering, to acknowledge security forces role in the commission of gross human rights violations, and to address violations committed in the past and present, has entrenched impunity and allows serious violations to recur, Türk said. The report also describes a long-standing pattern of intimidation and harassment of journalists and civil society actors, especially those working on enforced disappearances, land disputes and environmental issues. Families, particularly of those forcibly disappeared also face intimidation, arrest and surveillance by security services in their attempts to seek the truth, or even commemorate the absence of their loved ones. Crimes and violations committed during and after the civil war, including the 2019 Easter Sunday bombings, must not go unpunished. They must be thoroughly investigated, and those responsible held to account, the High Commissioner said. In the absence of willingness or ability of the Sri Lankan State to prosecute and punish perpetrators of crimes, the report urges the international community to pursue complementary strategies to support accountability in Sri Lanka, including appropriate use of extraterritorial and universal jurisdiction, targeted sanctions against credibly alleged perpetrators and other available measures, consistent with international law.",

A group of representatives of the Sri Lanka Telecom Engineers Association met with Mr. Jayaweera to express their concerns about the proposed sale of SLT, urging him intervene against the governments attempt to privatize the state-owned enterprise. The union representatives also handed over a letter outlining their objections regarding the matter. Speaking during the discussion, entrepreneur Dilith Jayaweera questioned the logic behind selling profitable state-owned enterprises, emphasizing the potential for the government to manage and regulate sectors like telecommunication for financial benefit. Why are public entrepreneurial-minded people selling these assets? he questioned. Drawing a comparison with Singapore, he highlighted how the Singaporean government, with its entrepreneurial mindset, owns and operates some of the most profitable businesses in the country. Telecom is a regulated sector. The government has the power to regulate it and generate revenue. The issue today is that the government has no substantial sources of income beyond taxes and fees, and is now looking to sell the remaining assets, Mr. Jayaweera noted. The Sarvajana Balaya alliances presidential candidate also criticized the governments approach to sell Sri Lanka Telecom, noting, The governments argument is to collect some tax from the private sector after selling these assets, but taxes are just the crumbs that fall below. Profits are not made that way.",

The order was issued after the defendants were produced before the Maligakanda Magistrates Court today (22). The Criminal Investigation Department (CID) arrested Rambukwella on 02 February over his alleged complicity in the procurement of substandard IVIG vials. Accordingly, the former Minister of Health is currently in remand custody in connection with his alleged complicity in the procurement of substandard human intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) vials. The arrest came hot on the heels of pressure from civil society activists and health sector trade unionists, who called for the immediate apprehension of the lawmaker. In October 2023, the National Medicines Regulatory Authority (NMRA) revealed that forged documents were found to have been submitted for Customs clearance to procure a batch of vials containing human immunoglobulin, an antibody produced by blood plasma cells, which later failed the quality tests.",

        "date": "August 22, 2024 04:31 pm",
        "content": "The Chairman of the Expert Committee on Public Service Salary Disparities, Udaya R. Seneviratne said that the basic salary of public service employees will be increased by a minimum of 24 for primary-level service categories. For all government officials, salaries will gradually increase from an average of 24 to 50, depending on current fiscal feasibility, he said. He further said in light of prevailing inflation and economic conditions, a cost of living allowance of Rs. 25,000 will remain unchanged for three years and will be provided to all government employees for three consecutive years, starting from January 2025, with 2025 being considered the base year. Mr. Seneviratne emphasized that regardless of which government is in power, there is a pressing need to increase the salaries of public servants. These proposals were made to address and eliminate salary disparities, taking into account past trade union protests within the public service. Accordingly, the proposals have received approval from both the Cabinet and the Treasury. The Chairman of the Expert Committee on Public Service Salary Disparities, Udaya R. Seneviratne shared these views during a press conference titled Collective Path to a Stable Country held today (22) at the Presidential Media Centre. He stated that the basic salary for the primary-level service category employees will be Rs. 30,000.00, with the total salary, including the cost of living allowance, amounting to Rs. 55,000.00. Public service plays a vital role in the development of Sri Lanka and is also the driving force of development. The restructuring efforts are prioritized to address the current challenges in the public sector. The Presidential Expert Committee on Public Service Salary Disparities has presented a comprehensive program aimed at creating a satisfying work environment for public servants, delivering excellent service to the people, and positioning the public service as a key driver of economic development. He also said that action will be taken to provide the cost of living allowance of Rs. 12,500 each for the pensioners from January 2025 and measures will also be taken to award the claimed salary increment for the government officials who retired prior to the year 2020 and revise their pension accordingly. Further, action will be taken to provide benefit through the Budget 2025 in step wise based on the current fiscal viability. To enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of the Public Service and provide exceptional service to the public, a scientific work study will be conducted in 2025. This study will inform a comprehensive program to restructure the Public Service as needed. A thorough assessment of the required number of employees will also be carried out based on this evaluation. Appropriate performance indicators (KPIs) will be introduced for government employees, and a system for granting annual salary increments based on performance progress will be developed. Additionally, methods for providing incentives and other non-financial benefits based on performance will be implemented. To enhance the quality of public service and ensure a distinctive government service for taxpayers under the current tax policy, a competitive recruitment system will be established. This system will be based on the Sri Lanka Qualification Framework (SLQF) and National Vocational Qualification (NVQ). This approach aims to ensure that qualified individuals are placed in appropriate roles, creating a more effective and efficient public service. The governments capital investment program for E-Governance will prioritize the digitization and automation of the Public Service, with a focus on incorporating technology in every possible aspect over the next three years, starting in 2025. Special attention will be given to implementing E-Governance across government ministries and institutions, beginning with Grama Niladhari offices. This initiative aims to enhance the performance of revenue-generating institutions and those providing public services. Over the next three years, efforts will be made to restructure identified public institutions from their traditional departmental modeldependent on the General Treasury for many yearsinto an innovative enterprise model. These institutions will be transformed into Public Quoted Companies with a democratic governance structure, where ownership is divided as 30 government shares, 30 investor shares, 30 public shares through stock market listing, and 10 employee shares. Government officials who are eligible for pensions and are assigned to these new institutions will have their pensions deferred until they reach age 60. They will receive other benefits during their service in these institutions. Measures will be introduced to optimize the delivery of certain government services by outsourcing these services to external providers. This approach aims to reduce government expenditures and encourage private sector involvement. It will help avoid unnecessary recruitment in the Public Service and enable private providers to offer more effective services. As a result, economic services will be expanded. To ease the financial burden on government employees, the Agrahara Medical Insurance Scheme will be restructured to lower their health expenses. The plan is to maximize benefits through the scheme, with each government employee, including pensioners, contributing Rs. 1,000 per month. Additionally, the National Insurance Trust Fund, which administers the Agrahara scheme, will enhance medical services for government employees. This will involve modernizing the national hospital system and gradually upgrading selected government hospitals with special amenities for employees. Due to the high demand for Sri Lankans abroad, many are migrating for employment and higher education, drawn by the countrys reputation for free education and skilled human resources. As a result, Sri Lanka loses valuable talent and significant foreign exchange is spent on overseas education. A large number of eligible students miss out on opportunities to study at state universities due to limitations in free higher education, forcing parents to cover high costs for private institutions and international universities. The trend of university students leaving the country is increasing due to insufficient economic benefits. To address these issues, it is proposed to secure free higher education, grant legal and administrative independence to universities, and offer affordable courses by effectively utilizing physical and human resources. This will develop additional revenue streams and benefit all stakeholders. By improving this system and integrating with foreign universities and training institutions, Sri Lanka could become a Centre for Knowledge, expanding opportunities for international students to complete their education in Sri Lanka and becoming a leading sector for foreign exchange earnings. Sri Lanka has achieved a notable position in health indicators due to its establishment of free health services, leading to increased international recognition for its healthcare services and professionals. However, the migration of health professionals is rising due to international demand. To address this, there is potential to transform Sri Lanka into a centre for internationally recognized health services by elevating the quality of free healthcare provided. Strategies will be developed to deliver healthcare to both local and foreign communities efficiently and economically. This includes managing free healthcare facilities securely and introducing healthcare innovations that leverage existing physical and human resources. Similarly, Ayurvedic medical services can be enhanced to generate economic benefits. It is proposed to capitalize on Sri Lankas potential to become a leading centre in healthcare-based tourism.

        "date": "August 22, 2024 06:20 pm",
        "content": "The body of British tech magnate Mike Lynch was retrieved on Thursday from the wreck of his family yacht that sank earlier this week off the coast of Sicily during a violent storm, a source close to the rescue operation said. Lynchs 18-year-old daughter Hannah is still unaccounted for, the source said. The bodies of the other four people who vanished when the boat went down were recovered from the yacht on Wednesday. The British-flagged Bayesian, a 56-metre-long (184-ft) superyacht carrying 22 passengers and crew, was anchored off the port of Porticello, near Palermo, when it disappeared beneath the waves in a matter of minutes after the bad weather struck. Lynch, 59, was one of the UKs best-known tech entrepreneurs and had invited friends to join him on the yacht to celebrate his recent acquittal in a major U.S. fraud trial. His body was brought ashore in a blue body bag and driven in an ambulance to a nearby hospital morgue. Besides Lynch and his daughter, the other people who failed to escape from the boat were Judy and Jonathan Bloomer, a non-executive chair of Morgan Stanley International; and Clifford Chance lawyer Chris Morvillo and his wife, Neda Morvillo. Fifteen people, including Lynchs wife, managed to get to safety, while the body of the onboard chef, Canadian-Antiguan national Recaldo Thomas, was found near the wreck hours after the disaster. Specialist rescuers have been searching inside the hull of the sunken yacht for the past three days, but operations have been challenging due to the depth and the narrowness of the places that the divers are scouring, the fire brigade said. It compared the efforts to those carried out, on a larger scale, for the Costa Concordia, the luxury cruise liner that capsized off the Italian island of Giglio in January 2012, killing 32 people. UNSINKABLE The disaster has baffled naval marine experts who said such a vessel, built by Italian high-end yacht manufacturer Perini and presumed to have top-class fittings and safety features, should have been able to withstand such weather. Prosecutors in the nearby town of Termini Imerese have opened an investigation and authorities have started questioning passengers and witnesses. The captain, James Cutfield, and his eight surviving crew members have made no public comment on the disaster. Giovanni Costantino, CEO of the Italian Sea Group which includes Perini, said the Bayesian was one of the safest boats in the world and basically unsinkable. He added that he believed the disaster was caused by a chain of human mistakes and that the storm had been expected, in interviews with Italian media. The ship sank because it took on water, from where investigators will have to say, Costantino told television news programme TG1 late on Wednesday. Citing data from the yachts automatic tracking system and based on available footage, Costantino said it took 16 minutes from when the wind began buffeting the yacht, and it began taking on water, for it to sink. Costantino said the Milan-listed group had suffered enormous damage to its reputation, with shares falling 2.5 since the disaster. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

Emphasizing his respect for both the right to vote and the right to live, the President also noted that every hour was crucial in the effort to stabilize the countrys economy. Wickremesinghe stressed that had he devoted that time to conducting the Local Government elections, achieving economic stability would not have been possible. He highlighted that people cannot maintain their day to day lives without essentials such as gas, medicine, food, and fuel. The President affirmed that over the past two years, he has been dedicated to safeguarding the basic rights of the people and stated that he will continue to make necessary decisions to protect these rights in the future. President Wickremesinghe further stated that the decision has been made to hold the General Election after the Presidential Election. The necessary funds for this have already been secured.

President Ranil Wickremesinghe also added: Instead of pursuing legal action, why didnt the opposition take their case to the Supreme Court in 2022 to address the economic issues and work towards a return to normalcy? I have no regrets about postponing the election. In this country, presidential and general elections are fundamental rights of the people, and I respect that right to vote. Equally important is the right to basic necessities such as gas, medicine, and fuel. I prioritized these essential needs and will continue to do so if required. The Supreme Court has advised that the Election Commission should determine the timing of the elections. We have collectively decided to hold the general election after the presidential election, and the necessary funds for this have been secured. The Provincial Council elections are planned to follow. We acknowledge the importance of these elections and are currently securing the funds needed. Local Government and Municipal Council elections will be scheduled subsequently, with new laws to be introduced, including measures for youth representation.

        "date": "August 23, 2024 09:16 am",
        "content": "A gold rush is here. The precious metal hit an all time high this week. The spot price for gold closed Tuesday above 2,514, according to data from FactSet. Thats the highest closing price recorded for the commodity to date. Heres what you need to know. What is the price of gold today? The spot price of gold closed Tuesday at just over 2,514 per Troy ounce  the standard for measuring precious metals, which is equivalent to 31 grams. That would make a gold bar or brick weighing 400 Troy ounces worth more than 1 million today. This weeks record high means that the price of gold has climbed hundreds of dollars per Troy ounce over the last year. Tuesdays price is up nearly 620 from this time in 2023. Why is the price of gold going up? There are a few factors behind the recent gains. Interest in buying gold often comes at times of uncertainty  with potential concerns around inflation and the strength of the U.S. dollar, for example, causing some to look for alternative places to park their money. Gold also saw a surge in the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic. Giovanni Staunovo, a commodity analyst at UBS Global Wealth Management, said the main drivers of recent gold gains have been the weaker U.S. dollar and expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut its benchmark interest rate next month. With particular concern focused on the health of the job market, all eyes will be on a Friday speech from Fed Chair Jerome Powell in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. Another factor is strong demand from central banks  which is currently well-above the five year average, notes Joe Cavatoni, senior market strategist at the World Gold Council. Cavatoni says this reflects heightened concern with inflation and economic stability. He also pointed to ongoing geopolitical tensions, among other factors, that have caused some to buy more gold recently. The wars in Ukraine and Gaza have notably fueled uncertainty around the world. And numerous countries, including the United States, are also in the midst of a tumultuous election year  which could prove crucial to future economic policy. Is gold worth the investment? Advocates of investing in gold call it a safe haven, arguing the commodity can serve to diversify and balance your investment portfolio, as well as mitigate possible risks down the road. Some also take comfort in buying something tangible that has the potential to increase in value over time. Staunovos team at UBS forecasts the price of gold will reach 2,600 by this years end  and 2,700 by mid-2025. UBS sees lower U.S. interest rates and the weaker dollar supporting inflows into gold ETFs, or exchange traded funds, consequently boosting investment demand. Still, future gains are never promised and not everyone agrees gold is a good investment. Critics say gold isnt always the inflation hedge many say it is  and that there are more efficient ways to protect against potential loss of capital, such as through derivative-based investments. The Commodity Futures Trade Commission has also previously warned people to be wary of investing in gold. Precious metals can be highly volatile, the commission said, and prices rise as demand goes up  meaning when economic anxiety or instability is high, the people who typically profit from precious metals are the sellers. If you do choose to invest in gold, the commission adds, its important to educate yourself on safe trading practices and be cautious of potential scams and counterfeits on the market.

        "date": "August 23, 2024 09:51 am",
        "content": "Hundreds of California sea lions have taken over San Carlos Beach in Monterey, California, prompting local officials to close the area to people. Caution tape has been put up but crowds are still drawn to the animal spectacle, taking photos of the sea lions as they rest and play on the sand and in the water. While sea lions, or eared seals, are often seen at certain beaches up and down the California coast, local residents say they have never seen so many of the marine mammals gathered in Monterey. Lisa Uttal, a marine biologist with the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary, said it was unclear exactly why the sea lions chose San Carlos Beach, but they may be attracted to the rich diversity in the ecosystems food supply. Virtually all those gathered on the beach were male, she said. They migrate up here down from Ventura and the Channel Islands ... They are incredibly mobile. Theyre usually chasing the food and because Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary is so productive out here, the productivity is really rich, Uttal said. They were expected to remain on San Carlos Beach for three to four weeks, Uttal said. Marge Brigadier, a volunteer with Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuarys Bay Net program, said the sea lions were protected by the U.S. Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972, which prohibits people from changing the behavior of the sea lions, meaning that approaching too close or forcing them to flee is a violation. People just need to think about how they would feel if they were resting on their bed taking a nap and something big kept coming and chasing them out of the house, Brigadier said.

        "title": "Kiribatis pro-China govt bars foreign officials from visiting until 2025, citing elections",
        "date": "August 23, 2024 11:19 am",
        "content": "The government of Kiribati is suspending all diplomatic visits to the tiny Pacific Island nation until next year and has cancelled some already planned, because it is in the midst of an election process that could run for several more months, an official said Thursday. The official in Kiribatis foreign ministry told The Associated Press that a message announcing the pause in diplomatic trips was sent earlier this week to countries that have diplomatic relations with Kiribati  a low-lying atoll of 120,000 people. It follows escalating friction between Kiribati and Western nations  particularly Australia, a major aid donor  over the countrys deepening ties with China. Kiribati is threatened by rising sea levels and does not command the resource wealth or tourism branding of some other Pacific islands. But its proximity to Hawaii and location in a huge ocean expanse have bolstered its strategic importance and provoked an influence skirmish between Western powers and China. A national election was held for 44 of the 45 seats in Kiribatis parliament this month  although the winners have yet to declare their party affiliations and it is not known which bloc will form the government. Negotiations have begun to decide the governing group, and a president will be chosen when nominees are put to a public vote, expected in October. Officials cannot accommodate diplomatic visits until a government is formed and a president elected, ministry spokesperson Turia Tekirua said in a telephone interview. Small delegations could apply for exemptions, she added. Some analysts said that while Kiribatis bureaucracy is small, the suspension could reflect a desire to avoid foreign checks on its government formation process. It does reflect a pattern of seeking to avoid international scrutiny, which we have seen under this government, said Mihai Sora, director of the Pacific islands program at the Lowy Institute, an Australia-based think tank. The suspension could also provide a degree of political cover for the intense lobbying and deal-making that will now be taking place ahead of the presidential vote, Sora added. Kiribati switched its allegiance from pro-Taiwan to pro-Beijing in 2019, citing its national interest in joining several other Pacific nations that have severed diplomatic ties with Taipei in recent years. Self-governing Taiwan is claimed by China, and since the shift, Beijing has increased aid to Kiribati. Ahead of the elections, Australians expressed concerns that the lack of information filtering out of Kiribati as well as delayed or refused visas for foreign officials and judges in recent years suggest Beijings sway is growing. The suspension of visits will not eject diplomats from Kiribati and many countries in the region already have a presence there, including Australian and China. The U.S. announced plans for an embassy in Kiribati in 2022, although it is still awaiting government approval. George Carter, an expert on Kiribati at the Australian National University in Canberra, said the ban appears to be an attempt to safeguard politicians from foreign interference as they negotiate to form a government. This is a way for the current government to say we want to be just among Kiribati, no foreign interference, he said. A senior New Zealand government official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said it was not yet clear how widely diplomatic visits would be defined. New Zealands foreign ministry said in a written statement only that it was aware that the Republic of Kiribati has asked to suspend incoming visits. Australias department of foreign affairs said it did not share official correspondence from other governments. Officials in South Korea and Japan  two other countries with which Kiribati has close ties  did not immediately comment. Winston Peters, New Zealands foreign minister, told the AP it was not unusual for countries to request that visiting delegations avoid scheduling trips close to an election. He said he would wait to see what develops straight after the presidential vote. Kiribatis president since 2016, Taneti Maamau, won his parliament seat easily and will seek a third presidential term. The opposition leader, Tessie Lambourne, also handily won her post. Those elected are now working to form voting blocs. Lawmakers for the outgoing governing bloc hold 22 seats in the new parliament, which is one short of a majority, but it is not unusual for lawmakers in Kiribati to switch parties, and first-time members have yet to declare their party affiliation. Kiribati is one of the most aid-dependent nations in the world and is rated at high risk of external debt distress by the International Monetary Fund. It is also threatened by coastal erosion and rising seas that have contaminated drinking water and driven much of the population onto South Tarawa, the most populous island. Ruth Cross Kwansing, one of the new lawmakers who is one of the record five women to win parliament seats, has yet to choose her party affiliation. Our country needs more women in decision-making positions and entrepreneurial areas, she told the AP on Friday. Health, peace, reconciliation and economic progress will flood every aspect of life as long as women and men are working alongside each other. Source: The Associated Press --Agencies",

        "date": "August 23, 2024 11:46 am",
        "content": "Apple is ready to push out the new iPhone 16 line-up in just a few weeks. The global launch is expected to take place on September 10. While Apple is still keeping details under wraps, the leaks and rumours are doing rounds online. In a recent leak, the iPhone 16 smartphones will feature a camera much better than it has ever seen. The rumour has it that Apple is planning to bring big changes, including a higher-resolution ultra-wide camera and the rumoured capture button, according to an AppleInsider report. The report suggests that the new iPhone 16 series will use a new format for images. That new format is said to be called JPEG-XL. It will sit alongside HEIF, JPEG, HEIF Max, ProRaw, and ProRAW Max that are offered now. iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus: Leaked camera specs According to the report, both the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus will sport a dual-camera setup on the back panel. The camera setup is expected to feature a primary wide-angle lens offering 1x and 2x zoom capabilities, alongside a secondary ultra-wide lens for capturing more expansive scenes at 0.5x zoom. Earlier, the rumours of the design revealed that these cameras will be placed vertically, similar to iPhone 11. It also suggests that the primary camera specs will remain the same as previous models. It will still be 48MP with an f1.6 aperture and optical quality 2X telephoto capabilities. The ultra wide, though, will get a faster f2.2 aperture from the f2.4 it had before. This allows more light to hit the sensor, improving low-light shots. iPhone 16 Pro and 16 Pro Max While the iPhone 16 and 16 Plus models will feature a change, the Pro models are speculated to welcome a bigger shift. First things first, the Pro model design looks the same as the earlier models. They still have three cameras on the back: a wide camera, an ultra-wide camera, and a telephoto camera. The primary sensor is again, staying the same. Its still 48MP with an f1.78 aperture that can also take 2X optical-quality 12MP telephoto shots, and has 1.22 micrometer pixels. The telephoto lens is also the same with 12MP and an f2.8 aperture. The ultra-wide lens will boast a significant upgrade to 48MP, featuring pixel-binning technology, which allows for flexible pixel sizes: 0.7 micrometers when capturing full-resolution images and 1.4 micrometers when utilising quad-pixel mode for enhanced low-light performance, according to the AppleInsider report. The speculations are that there will also be a 48MP ProRaw camera lens, which allows for more options in post-processing. Capture button for all The rumoured Capture button is expected to feature in all devices in the iPhone 16 series. The latest renders surrounding the changes suggest the possible introduction of a dedicated Capture button and a significant Action button, hinting at Apples focus on making the iPhone 16 Pro more capable in mobile photography. According to reports, the quick button will allow users to adjust focus and zoom levels, offering greater control over their camera while capturing that perfect moment. The new button will be positioned in the lower-right corner of the device, so when held in landscape mode, it will be located at the top, naturally aligning with your index finger on the camera bump. With the Capture button, the users may be able to get rid of the camera from the lock screen and replace it with this physical control. Source: India Today --Agencies",

        "content": "The Presidents Fund has stepped up to provide necessary financial assistance to twelve Sri Lankan athletes, who were on the verge of missing the 2024 World Junior Athletics Championship in Lima, Peru due to a lack of financial support. This intervention came after Ada Derana revealed the athletes predicament. The 2024 World Junior Athletics Championship, scheduled to take place from August 27 to 31, is an important platform for young athletes to demonstrate their abilities on the global stage. However, despite their qualification, the Sri Lankan athletes faced the possibility of being left behind as the authorities of the Sports Ministry had refused to provide necessary provisions, including air tickets. Against this backdrop, the Sri Lanka Athletics Association had taken steps to obtain the necessary visas for the athletes after travelling to India since the athletes have successfully met the required performance standards. Nevertheless, the absence of financial backing from the ministry jeopardized their participation since the associations request for financial assistance from the Sports Ministry had been rejected, with a written response notifying that the budget allocated for foreign competition trips had already been exhausted, leaving no funds available for air tickets or any other essential provisions for the World Junior Athletics Championship. Following the widespread attention brought to this situation by Ada Derana, which highlighted the athletes plight, the Presidents Fund has allocated the required funds to cover the athletes air travel expenses, ensuring their participation in the championship. The athletes are now set to compete in the international event, restoring hope for their athletic futures.",

        "date": "August 23, 2024 02:21 pm",
        "content": "Sri Lanka will host New Zealand for a two-match Test series during next months presidential election, Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) announced today. The first Test will begin on September 18 at Galle, but there will be a rest day on September 21 when the voting is set to take place, the board said. The Test matches are a part of the ICC World Test Championship Cycle of 2023  2025, according to the SLC. The Test series, which is scheduled to be played at the Galle International Cricket Stadium, will kick off on 18 September. The first match of the two-match series will take place from September 18 to 23, while the second match is set to be played from September 26 to 30. Meanwhile, September 21 has been named as a rest day for the 1st Test match owing to the Presidential Election in Sri Lanka, the SLC pointed out. New Zealands last tour of Sri Lanka was in August 2019, when they drew a two-match Test series with the hosts. Next months presidential election is the countrys first poll since it declared a sovereign default in 2022 during an unprecedented economic crisis. This is the first time a Test match is being played with a rest day in between in more than a decade, and the first time in Sri Lanka since 2001. The rest days were a common feature of Test matches in the bygone 19th century, especially in England on Sundays, before the concept was eradicated altogether. Still, due to a few unavoidable circumstances like elections, religious or spiritual days or a lockdown, there have been rest days. This will be only the third in the 20th century. The last six-day Test match with a rest day was in Dhaka in 2008 where December 29 was off due to parliamentary elections. --With agencies inputs",

        "date": "August 23, 2024 02:24 pm",
        "content": "Thailand has announced its first confirmed case of a new, potentially deadlier strain of Mpox - the first in Asia, and second outside of Africa. According to Thailands Department of Disease Control, the infected 66-year-old European man arrived in Bangkok from an unnamed African country on 14 August. He began displaying symptoms the next day, and immediately went to hospital. It has since been confirmed he had contracted Mpox, and in particular the strain known as Clade 1b. At least 450 people have died from Mpox in an outbreak centred in the Democratic Repulic of Congo which started last year. It has since spread to a number of nearby countries - including Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda and Uganda, all of which were previously unaffected by Mpox. Now a more worrying strain of Mpox called Clade 1b has been identified in the east of the DRC, which is being spread along the border and into neighbouring countries. Sweden was the first place outside of the African continent to confirm a case of Clade 1b a week ago. The infected man had also recently travelled to an unnamed African country, Swedens public health ministry said at the time. The infection in Thailand is the first confirmed case of Clade 1b in Asia. Mpox is transmitted through close contact, such as sex, skin-to-skin contact and talking or breathing close to another person  but it is nowhere near as infectious as other viruses like Covid and measles. But the spread of the new variant and its high fatality rate in parts of Africa has sparked concern among scientists, and led the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare it a public health emergency of international concern. Outbreaks can be controlled by spreading awareness of the disease, tracking close contacts and preventing infections with vaccines, though these are usually only available for people at risk or those who have been in close contact with an infected person. Vaccines in Africa are in short supply, but there are plans for millions of doses to arrive in the DRC in the next week or so. In Thailand, the Department of Disease Control has tracked down some 43 patients who were sitting in the rows near the unidentified man, and those who met him after he landed. They will all be monitored for 21 days. Thailand is also requiring people travelling from 42 risk countries to test on arrival. Mpox causes flu-like symptoms and skin lesions. For most people, its a mild illness but it can be fatal. The new strain spreading in central Africa is thought to be more deadly than previous ones - with four in 100 cases leading to death. Mpox is most common in the tropical rainforests of West and Central Africa and there are thousands of infections every year. Another strain - Clade 2 - which is far milder, caused a global public health emergency in 2022. There are still cases of that Mpox strain in many countries. Source: BBC --Agencies",

        "date": "August 23, 2024 04:25 pm",
        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe expressed his intention to implement recommendations from the commission report led by former Chief Justice Priyasad Depp on digitizing Sri Lankas election system. Speaking at an IT professionals meeting yesterday (22) at Waters Edge Hotel in Battaramulla, the President indicated that the new digital election system might be piloted in the upcoming local government elections. Responding to a question raised on the possibility to digitize the electoral system, he said, It should be done. We have received the report with recommendations from the committee chaired by former Chief Justice Priyasad Depp, and we intend to follow those recommendations. We can introduce the digital election system at the national level by first conducting an experiment during the local government elections, he said. The meeting, themed Coding the Nations Future, featured a notable welcome by a robot named Pepper, developed using Artificial Intelligence (AI). Mr. Siddhartha Raja, Senior Digital Development Specialist from the World Bank delivered the keynote address. President Wickremesinghes comments highlight a forward-looking approach to enhancing Sri Lankas electoral process through digital technology, reflecting the governments commitment to modernizing key systems and improving efficiency in governance. President of the Sri Lanka Association of Software and Service Companies (SLASSCOM) Mr. Nishan Mendis, Executive Member of the BCS Institute of Information Technology Mr. Imran Vilcassim, President of the Sri Lanka Information Technology Industry Federation (FITIS) Mr. Indika De Soyza and Vice President of the Sri Lanka Computer Association Mr. Heshan Samaratunga, along with President Ranil Wickremesinghe, participated in a panel discussion. Addressing the gathering the President elaborated: The goal is to transform Sri Lanka into an export-oriented economy. However, achieving this in the early or mid-21st century requires technology. In todays world, technology is essential for progress, whether for a business or a nation. We recognized this and decided to embrace technology as a fundamental pillar of our economy, aiming to become a leader in Asia. Alongside this, we identified areas requiring modernization, such as agriculture. We have millions of acres of subsistence farming, and another 300,000 acres that could be cultivated. By modernizing agriculture and leveraging technology, we can become a food-exporting nation. Technology also plays a crucial role in tourism, renewable energy, and our broader digital economy. Our economy now has two key characteristics: digitalization and a green economy. Both go hand in hand. The question we must answer is how to initiate this transformation and where to go from here. Previous government policies on science and technology focused heavily on state-driven initiatives with limited results. We are moving away from this approach to one that is market-driven and led by the private sector. The government will support research in pure sciences through the National Science Foundation and manage research funding more effectively. For commercially driven research, the newly established council will fund and support projects with a market focus, ensuring success through collaboration. Additionally, the Digital Transformation Agency and the Centre for AI will play key roles in driving technological advancement. However, the governments primary responsibility is to provide infrastructure, enact laws, and cultivate human resources. We must focus on producing skilled talent, knowing that some will go abroad, but as salaries improve, more will stay. We also need to modernize schools to prepare them for the 2030s and 2040s, a process that will take time. Vocational education is being radically reorganized, with vocational training centers and institutes being consolidated under the Vocational Skills Agency of Sri Lanka. We will also establish University Colleges of Technology and Management to offer associate degrees, expand existing state universities, and promote nongovernment universities in technology. The government is committed to establishing four new universities, including a campus of the Chennai IIT in Galaha, a gift from Prime Minister Modi, as well as new technology universities in Kurunegala, Seethawaka, and Siyane. We hope to see more private universities in Sri Lanka as well. With this infrastructure and talent in place, we can fund innovation and expand the sector. Rather than reinventing the wheel, we plan to build on Indias successes, accelerating our progress by adopting proven methods. Our goal is to develop a USD 15 billion digital economy as part of our broader vision for an USD 85 billion economy. By mid-century, we aim to become USD 350 billion economy or more.

The Al Nassr and Portugal forward has created a social media storm after his YouTube channel garnered 10 million subscribers within an astonishing 10 hours of the account being made public for the fans. Ronaldo has already reached more than 28 million subscribers on YouTube, and the numbers are expected to keep increasing as time goes by. While the football star received a YouTube Gold Play Button after reaching a million followers in less than 90 minutes of the channel being created, he will also get his hands on a Diamond Play Button, which is awarded to YouTubers for reaching 10 million subscribers. A feat that takes people several years to achieve has been accomplished by the 39-year-old within 10 hours. Real Ronaldo behind the scene Ronaldo has started to post content on his channel, where he promises his fans to upload some behind-the-scenes footage so that fans can see the real Cristiano Ronaldo as well. The channel will also feature Cristianos wife, Georgina Rodriguez, along with his eldest son, Cristiano Ronaldo Jr. Before Cristianos channel was created, the person who reached 10 million subscribers in the least time was MrBeast, who achieved the feat in 132 days.
