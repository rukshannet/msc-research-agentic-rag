        "title": "River for Jaffna project to fully address water problem in north  President",
        "date": "August 2, 2024 09:01 pm",
        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe declared the immediate initiation of the River for Jaffna project, which is designed to provide a comprehensive solution to the water scarcity issues in the northern region of Sri Lanka. The President made these remarks while attending the opening of the Thalaiyady Seawater Desalination Plant, part of the Jaffna-Kilinochchi Water Supply Project, this morning (02). President Ranil Wickremesinghe further stated that it has been 15 years since the end of the civil war in the north. He emphasized the need for everyone to continue working together on development and expressed his goal to transform the north into a developed province within the next 5-10 years. The Thalaiyady Sea Water Desalination Plant, part of the Jaffna-Kilinochchi Water Supply Project, is managed by the National Water Supply and Drainage Board under the Ministry of Water Supply and Estate Infrastructure Development, with financial support from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the Government of Sri Lanka. To address the drinking water needs of Jaffna and Kilinochchi, the Government of Sri Lanka launched the Jaffna-Kilinochchi District Water Supply and Sanitation Project (JKWSSP) in 2011 with support from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the French Development Bank (AFD). Currently, there are 2.5 million water connections nationwide, and the Water Supply and Sanitation Project aims to add 60,000 new connections. The main objective of the project is to provide safe drinking water to 300,000 people and improve sanitation facilities for 80,000 people in the Jaffna and Kilinochchi districts of Sri Lankas Northern Province. In 2017, the Asian Development Bank signed a contract for the construction of the desalination plant. To date, the project has completed the construction of 20 elevated water tanks, 186 km of water transmission pipelines, and 382 km of water distribution pipelines. The contract for the desalination plant was awarded in January 2021. The total cost of the project is USD 266 million, and the Jaffna-Kilinochchi District Water Supply and Sanitation Project is expected to be completed by mid-2025, said the Presidents Media Division. President Ranil Wickremesinghe further commented, This water purification plant will serve as the primary facility of its kind in Sri Lanka. I want to express my gratitude to the local residents who provided the land for its construction. A request has been made to establish a separate Grama Niladhari Division for this village, and I will recommend this to the governor to address this request. The establishment of this water purification plant will significantly resolve the drinking water issues in Jaffna. We also intend to commence work on the Paliaru Reservoir to provide water to the Pooneryn area, in the future. I have also decided to launch a River for Jaffna program. Once both this purification plant and this program are fully implemented, the water problem in Jaffna will be completely resolved. This will help restore the Vadamarachchi area to its former lush state. To manage the costs of this drinking water, we plan to reduce expenses through solar energy projects. Additionally, we are introducing Drip Irrigation Systems to promote modern agriculture in the area. As we invest in water, it is essential to maximize the benefits we derive from it. These initiatives aim to further strengthen the local economy. We are also planning to renovate the port of Kankesanthurai in collaboration with India. An investment zone will be established at the site of the former cement factory. Additionally, the development of Palali will enhance tourism opportunities. This area has significant potential for producing wind and solar energy, which can generate substantial income. As a result, Jaffna is expected to become a developed area within the next 5-10 years. The government is not focusing on establishing universities in Jaffna because the provincial council has the capability to set up two or three universities there. It has been around 20 years since the end of the war, and it is now time for us to unite in our efforts for development. I extend my heartfelt thanks to the Asian Development Bank for their support in providing this water purification plant. Even during our financial crisis, they continued their assistance. We have now signed agreements with our Official Creditors Committee and the China Exim Bank, and we have also reached an agreement with the bondholders. With these agreements in place, we are receiving support from these nations. Japan has committed to resuming projects that were previously halted in our country, and development efforts in other countries are also progressing. Furthermore, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and I have taken the necessary steps to implement the agreements we reached, and the signing of these agreements is currently underway. We are collaborating with Amul to enhance liquid milk production. We should focus on increasing the countrys income and continue this program. This will help improve the economy and transform Jaffna into a major economic hub. I would like to express my gratitude to Jeevan Thondaman for his special interest and efforts in this initiative. We are collaborating with the Ministry of Water Supply and Estate Infrastructure Development to establish new villages in the hill country. These plantation communities are being relocated and developed into villages. --PMD--",

Indian Navy ship, INS Bitra, which was on deployment off Rameshwaram, coordinated with the Sri Lankan Navy ship and had received the fishermen and the dead body at sea at about 1.00 a.m. The Indian Navy ship then proceeded to Rameshwaram, where the Navy Officer from the Naval Detachment coordinated with marine police and Tamil Nadu Fisheries department in transferring the mortal remains and the fishermen, at around 3 am, a media release from the Indian authorities said. Meanwhile, the Indian Consulate General office in Jaffna confirmed that in cooperation with the government of Sri Lanka, the safe repatriation of the 02 Indian fishermen along with the mortal remains of the deceased fisherman from Jaffna was secured last night (02). Posting on X (formerly Twitter), it added that they reached Rameswaram in the early hours today (03). On August 1, a fisherman from Tamil Nadus Rameswaram reportedly died and another went missing when the boat in which they were fishing in the mid-sea capsized after allegedly colliding with the Sri Lankan Navy ship. However, issuing a media release, Sri Lanka Navy stated that the incident took place after the Indian fishing boat which was illegally poaching in Sri Lankan waters capsized during an interception attempt. The mechanised fishing boat capsized when the Sri Lankan Navy attempted to arrest them on charges of illegal fishing, a senior fisheries official had said. Four fishermen from Rameswaram who were on board fell into the sea after the boat capsized. While one fisherman reportedly died and another went missing, two men were rescued and detained by the Sri Lankan authorities then. --With agencies inputs",

        "date": "August 3, 2024 12:53 pm",
        "content": "US Vice-President Kamala Harris has passed the threshold to clinch the Democratic presidential nomination in a vote of party delegates. Speaking by telephone, Ms Harris said she was honoured to be the presumptive nominee as the virtual roll call continues ahead of the Democratic National Convention (DNC) in Chicago later this month. Ms Harris is the first black woman and first South Asian woman to become the White House standard-bearer for a major US political party. If she defeats Donald Trump, the Republican nominee, in November she would be Americas first female president. She ran unopposed in the virtual roll call after President Joe Biden stepped aside last month and quickly endorsed her. Several potential rivals followed his lead. On Friday afternoon, Ms Harris formally became the nominee after securing the support of 2,350 delegates, the threshold required to earn the nomination. We believe in the promise of America and thats what this campaign is about, she said in brief remarks by phone as she crossed the benchmark. We are in this, we are on the road and its not going to be easy, but were going to get this done. In total, Democrats have said 3,923 delegates - or 99 of the participants - plan to vote for her. The rollcall began on Thursday and ends on Monday. Presidential and vice-presidential nominees are typically anointed at their party conventions, but the relatively late date of the 2024 DNC risks falling afoul of state ballot access laws. Ms Harris, 59, was born in Oakland, California, and is the first Democratic nominee in the partys nearly 200-year history to hail from a western state. She rose through the ranks of state politics from San Francisco district attorney to California attorney general and then US senator. Before dropping out of the race, Mr Biden had easily won the Democratic primary. He did not face stiff opposition despite voter concerns about his age and had won backing from 99 of pledged DNC delegates. But the 81-year-old faced escalating pressure from within the party to withdraw after a poor June debate performance against Trump. The decision to hold a virtual nominating process ahead of the 19-22 August convention was made while Mr Biden was still the presumptive candidate. It came in response to rules for ballot access in the state of Ohio, which requires that candidates for the November ballot be formally selected 90 days before the election - or by 7 August. Republican leaders in the state had warned they would enforce the law and, though lawmakers eventually created an exemption as they have done in the past, Democrats said an early rollcall would pre-empt further risks of their candidates being excluded from the ballot. Delegates do not need to vote on the vice-presidential pick. Ms Harris is expected to name her running mate by Monday. Source: BBC --Agencies",

        "date": "August 4, 2024 07:34 am",
        "content": "Sri Lankas star spinner Wanindu Hasaranga has been ruled out of the remaining two ODIs against India after sustaining an injury to his left hamstring. Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) released an official statement to confirm Hasaranga being ruled out of the remainder of the series and named spinner Jeffrey Vandersay as his replacement. Wanindu Hasaranga will miss the remainder of the ODI series, as the player has suffered an injury to his left hamstring. He experienced pain in his left hamstring while delivering the last ball of his 10th over during the first ODI. An MRI performed on the player, following this, confirmed the injury. Jeffrey Vandersay comes into the squad in place of Hasaranga, SLC said in a statement. Hasaranga was one of the standout performers for the hosts in the first ODI. He picked three scalps, including stalwart batter Virat Kohl and KL Rahuls wicket, and gave away 58 runs in his 10-over spell. He went on to weave magic with his spin by removing Kuldeep Yadav to set up a thrilling finale to the game, which ended in a draw. The 27-year-old spinner has suffered from a fair share of injuries in 2024. Three months ago, Hasaranga, who was set to feature for Sunrisers Hyderabad, was ruled out of the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2024 due to chronic heel pain in his left foot. He travelled to Dubai to consult with a specialist for his injury. Hasaranga recovered from his injury and went on to lead Sri Lanka in the T20 World Cup. Under his captaincy, the Asian side failed to go past the group stage. They lost to South Africa and Bangladesh in the group stage and could only register one win against the Netherlands. Their game against Nepal was washed out due to rain. With just three points, Sri Lanka finished in the third spot in Group D. After the conclusion of the tournament, he stepped down from the captaincy. The Sri Lankan spinner, who was appointed as the T20I captain last year, led the team in 10 matches. Sri Lanka will miss the presence of Hasaranga in the second ODI against India on Sunday. Source: ANI --Agencies",

The shooting incidents have reportedly taken place in the Moneragala, Namal Oya and Inginiyagala areas. The deceased police officers were attached to the Karandugala Police Station in Moneragala, the Police Media Division said. Initially it was reported that a 33-year-old policeman has been shot dead at his residence in the Namal Oya area of Ampara early this morning (Aug 04).

        "date": "August 4, 2024 10:48 am",
        "content": "Violent disorder swept across several British cities on Saturday, injuring police and damaging property in the most widespread rioting in the country for 13 years, following the murder of three young girls in northwest England. Riots involving hundreds of anti-immigration protesters have erupted in towns and cities after false information spread rapidly on social media that the suspect in Mondays knife attack at a childrens dance class in Southport was a radical Muslim migrant. Police have said the suspect, Axel Rudakubana, 17, was born in Britain but protests by anti-immigration and anti-Muslim demonstrators have continued, descending into violence, arson and looting. Violent disorder erupted in Liverpool, Bristol, Hull and Belfast - four cities located in different corners of the UK - with scuffles breaking out and bricks and bottles thrown as anti-immigration protesters faced groups opposed to racism. Many police officers suffered injuries as they tried to keep several hundred rival protesters - largely young men who were chanting slogans - from clashing. In Liverpool, two officers were in hospital with suspected facial fractures while another was pushed from his motorbike and assaulted in the disorder involving some 750 protesters and a similar number of rival protesters, Merseyside Police, the force overseeing the northwestern city, said. At least two shops in Liverpool were vandalised and looted, police added. Similar scenes were witnessed in the southwestern city of Bristol although anti-racist protesters outnumbered anti-immigration groups, with TV footage showing them facing off with police in riot gear. In Belfast, some businesses reported damage to property while at least one was set on fire, according to police. I have no reason why they attacked us, said Rahmi Akyol, standing outside the shattered glass doors of his cafe in Belfast, which he said was attacked by dozens of people with bottles and chairs. Ive lived here 35 years. My kids, my wife is from here. I dont know what to say, its terrible, he said. Across Britain, police have arrested dozens of individuals for offences ranging from violent disorder to burglary and criminal damage. Extra police have been deployed across cities while mosques across the country have been advised to strengthen security following an attack on a mosque in Southport on Tuesday. UNFORGIVABLE VIOLENCE Prime Minister Keir Starmer, facing his first big test since his election a month ago, has condemned the far-right for the wave of violence and backed police to take strong action. He discussed the disorder with senior ministers on Saturday, his office said. The last time riots erupted in Britain was in 2011 when a much larger outbreak of violence took hold, with thousands of people taking to the streets for five nights after police shot dead a Black man in London. On Friday night, hundreds of anti-immigration demonstrators in Sunderland threw stones at police in riot gear near a mosque, before overturning vehicles, setting a car alight and starting a fire near a police station. This was not a protest. This was unforgivable violence and disorder, Mark Hall, chief police superintendent of the Sunderland area, told reporters on Saturday. Some further protests were planned for Sunday. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "date": "August 4, 2024 03:46 pm",
        "content": "India is seeking customs duty concession on a number of goods including cars, commercial vehicles and machinery from Sri Lanka under a comprehensive free trade agreement (FTA), talks for which are underway, an official said. India has also sought easier visa norms to further facilitate entry of professionals from here, the official said. The 14th round of talks between senior officials of India and Sri Lanka was concluded recently in Colombo. Issues which came up for the talks included rules of origin, goods, services, and technical barriers for trade. On the other hand, Sri Lanka has sought removal of a quota on apparel exports to India. The island nation is also asking for duty concessions on tea and certain agricultural commodities. The official said that as elections are announced in Sri Lanka, the next round of negotiations between the two countries will be held after that. The two nations have already implemented a free trade agreement in goods and now they are negotiating to expand the pact by including more goods and services. The India-Sri Lanka Free Trade Agreement (ISFTA) came into force in March 2000. It enhanced economic relations between the two countries by reducing tariffs on a wide range of goods. Since the original ISFTA focused solely on goods, both countries have been negotiating for several years to expand it into a Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA), which would include services, investment, and other areas of economic cooperation. Under the current FTA, India allowed limited imports of garments from Sri Lanka at a 50 per cent tariff (or customs duty) concession for up to 8 million pieces annually, with a requirement that 6 million of these pieces use Indian fabric. Additionally, India offered a 50 per cent tariff concession on up to 15 million kg of tea from Sri Lanka each year. Think tank Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI) said that Sri Lanka may be seeking removal of the quota on garments, especially considering that India has allowed duty-free imports of garments from Bangladesh under the South Asia Free Trade Agreement (SAFTA) for Least Developed Countries (LDCs). However agreeing to this request may not be easy for India as allowing duty free imports has led to a significant increase in garment imports from Bangladesh, growing from USD 144.25 million in FY2014 to USD 739.06 million in FY2024, a cumulative growth of 412.34 per cent, GTRI Founder Ajay Srivastava said. Sri Lanka has placed items like automobiles and electrical goods on its negative list, restricting their import. Since the implementation of the ISFTA, trade between the two countries has experienced fair growth. Indias exports to Sri Lanka increased from USD 499.3 million in FY2000 to USD 4.17 billion in 2023-24, a cumulative growth of 735.2 per cent. Meanwhile, imports grew from USD 44.3 million to USD 1.4 billion over the same period. In the last fiscal, Indias key exports to Sri Lanka included petroleum products (USD 704 million), cotton (USD 260 million), pharmaceuticals (USD 255 million), refined sugar (USD 206 million), fabric (USD 223 million), machinery (USD 171 million), pepper (USD 90.9 million), car and motorcycle parts (USD 79.3 million), onions (USD 63.4 million), and pulses (USD 32 million). Notably, Indias exports to Sri Lanka fell from USD 5.1 billion in FY2023 to USD 4.17 billion in FY2024, primarily due to a significant reduction in petroleum product exports, which declined from USD 1.78 billion to USD 704 million, GTRI said. Indias major imports from Sri Lanka in FY 2024 were coffee (USD 103.7 million), garments (USD 55.65 million), animal feed (USD 72.2 million), areca nut (USD 65.5 million), light pepper (USD 44.4 million), rough diamonds (USD 26.9 million), and rubber (USD 26.7 million). A Sakthivel, Apparel Export Promotion Council Southern Region in-charge, said that India should not extend concessions for garments to Sri Lanka, as the domestic industry could be impacted because of that. We too make those garments and I think India should not give more concessions, Sakthivel said. Source: PTI --Agencies",

The latest round of tension comes as the student leaders have declared a campaign of civil disobedience against the government. Police have used tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse demonstrators in several parts of Bangladesh. Around 200 people have been injured. In the capital, Dhaka, access to internet on mobile devices has been suspended, with some providers telling local media they received orders from the government. An official from the Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission (BTRC) official told BBC Bengali that 4G internet service in the Dhaka city area had stopped for now, but broadband services would continue. Without 4G and 3G people cannot communicate using the internet on their mobile devices. The source did not say when internet services would return to normal.

A curfew has been announced from 18:00 local time (12:00 GMT) on Sunday. According to local media reports, the curfew will be in place indefinitely. Thousands of people gathered in a main square in the capital and there have been violent incidents in other parts of the city. In some places, supporters of the governing Awami League are said to be clashing with anti-government protesters. The whole city has turned into a battleground, a policeman, who asked not to be named, told the AFP news agency. He said a crowd of several thousand protesters had set fire to cars and motorcycles outside a hospital. Students Against Discrimination, a group behind the anti-government demonstrations, has called on the prime minister to step down. The group announced a nationwide disobedience movement starting from Sunday, urging citizens not to pay taxes or any utility bills. The students have also called for a shutdown of all factories and public transport. The protest that started with a demand to abolish quotas in civil service jobs last month has now turned into a wider anti-government movement. More than 200 people were killed in the violence in July, many of them shot by police. Around 10,000 people have been reportedly detained in a major crackdown by security forces in the past two weeks. Those arrested included opposition supporters and students. The Awami League is also holding marches across the country on Sunday. The next few days are seen as crucial for both camps. Sheikh Hasina should not only resign, there should be a trial for the killings, looting and corruption, Nahid Islam, one of the student movements leaders, told thousands of people at a gathering on Saturday in Dhaka. The protests pose a momentous challenge to Ms Hasina, who was elected for a fourth consecutive term in January elections, boycotted by the main opposition. Students took to the streets last month over the reservation of many civil service jobs for relatives of the veterans of Bangladeshs independence war with Pakistan in 1971. Most of the quota has now been scaled back by the government following a government ruling, but students have continued to protest, demanding justice for those killed and injured. Now they want Ms Hasina to step down. Supporters of Ms Hasina have ruled out her resignation. Earlier, Ms Hasina offered unconditional dialogue with the student leaders, saying she wanted the violence to end. I want to sit with the agitating students of the movement and listen to them. I want no conflict, she said. But the student protesters have rejected her offer. Ms Hasina called in the military last month to restore order after several police stations and state buildings were set on fire during the protests. The Bangladeshi army chief, General Waker-Uz-Zaman, held a meeting with junior officers in Dhaka to assess the security situation. Bangladesh Army has always stood by the people and will continue to do so for the interest of people and in any need of the state, Gen Zaman said, according to a release by the Inter Services Public Relation Directorate. The protests have restarted in several cities and the government is struggling to control the rising tide of anger over how it initially responded to the demonstrations. Bangladeshi media says most of those killed in last months protests were shot dead by police. Thousands were injured. The government argues that police opened fire only in self-defence and to protect state properties. Source: BBC --Agencies",

        "title": "Music labels AI lawsuits create copyright puzzle for courts",
        "date": "August 4, 2024 06:16 pm",
        "content": "Country musician Tift Merritts most popular song on Spotify, Traveling Alone,, is a ballad with lyrics evoking solitude and the open road. Prompted by Reuters to make an Americana song in the style of Tift Merritt, the artificial intelligence music website Udio instantly generated Holy Grounds,, a ballad with lyrics about driving old backroads while watching the fields and skies shift and sway. Merritt, a Grammy-nominated singer and songwriter, told Reuters that the imitation Udio created doesnt make the cut for any album of mine. This is a great demonstration of the extent to which this technology is not transformative at all, Merritt said. Its stealing. Merritt, who is a longtime artists rights advocate, isnt the only musician sounding alarms. In April, she joined Billie Eilish, Nicki Minaj, Stevie Wonder and dozens of other artists in an open letter warning that AI-generated music trained on their recordings could sabotage creativity and sideline human artists. The big record labels are worried too. Sony Music , Universal Music Group and Warner Music in June, marking the music industrys entrance into high-stakes copyright battles over AI-generated content that are just starting to make their way through the courts. Ingesting massive amounts of creative labor to imitate it is not creative, said Merritt, an independent musician whose first record label is now owned by UMG, but who said she is not financially involved with the company. Thats stealing in order to be competition and replace us. Suno and Udio pointed to past public statements defending their technology when asked for comment for this story. They filed their initial responses in court on Thursday, denying any copyright violations and arguing that the lawsuits were attempts to stifle smaller competitors. They compared the labels protests to past industry concerns about synthesizers, drum machines and other innovations replacing human musicians. UNCHARTED GROUND The companies, which have both attracted venture capital funding, have said they bar users from creating songs explicitly mimicking top artists. But the new lawsuits say Suno and Udio can be prompted to reproduce elements of songs by Mariah Carey, James Brown and others and to mimic voices of artists like ABBA and Bruce Springsteen, showing that they misused the labels catalog of copyrighted recordings to train their systems. Mitch Glazier, CEO of the music industry trade group the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), said that the lawsuits document shameless copying of troves of recordings in order to flood the market with cheap imitations and drain away listens and income from real human artists and songwriters. AI has great promise  but only if its built on a sound, responsible, licensed footing, Glazier said. Asked for comment on the cases, Warner Music referred Reuters to the RIAA. Sony and UMG did not respond. The labels claims echo allegations by novelists, news outlets, music publishers and others in high-profile copyright lawsuits over chatbots like OpenAIs ChatGPT and Anthropics Claude that use generative AI to create text. Those lawsuits are still pending and in their early stages. Both sets of cases pose novel questions for the courts, including whether the law should make exceptions for AIs use of copyrighted material to create something new. The record labels cases, which could take years to play out, also raise questions unique to their subject matter - music. The interplay of melody, harmony, rhythm and other elements can make it harder to determine when parts of a copyrighted song have been infringed compared to works like written text, said Brian McBrearty, a musicologist who specializes in copyright analysis. Music has more factors than just the stream of words, McBrearty said. It has pitch, and it has rhythm, and it has harmonic context. Its a richer mix of different elements that make it a little bit less straightforward. Some claims in the AI copyright cases could hinge on comparisons between an AI systems output and the material allegedly misused to train it, requiring the kind of analysis that has challenged judges and juries in cases about music. In a 2018 decision that a dissenting judge called a dangerous precedent, Robin Thicke and Pharrell Williams lost a case brought by Marvin Gayes estate over the resemblance of their hit Blurred Lines to Gayes Got to Give It Up. But artists including Katy Perry and Ed Sheeran have since fended off similar complaints over their own songs. Suno and Udio argued in very similar court filings that their outputs do not infringe copyrights and said U.S. copyright law protects sound recordings that imitate or simulate other recorded music. Music copyright has always been a messy universe, said Julie Albert, an intellectual property partner at law firm Baker Botts in New York who is tracking the new cases. And even without that complication, Albert said fast-evolving AI technology is creating new uncertainty at every level of copyright law. WHOSE FAIR USE? The intricacies of music may matter less in the end if, as many expect, the AI cases boil down to a fair use defense against infringement claims - another area of U.S. copyright law filled with open questions. Fair use promotes freedom of expression by allowing the unauthorized use of copyright-protected works under certain circumstances, with courts often focusing on whether the new use transforms the original works. Defendants in AI copyright cases have argued that their products make fair use of human creations, and that any court ruling to the contrary would be disastrous for the potentially multi-trillion-dollar AI industry. Suno and Udio said in their answers to the labels lawsuits on Thursday that their use of existing recordings to help people create new songs is a quintessential fair use. Fair use could make or break the cases, legal experts said, but no court has yet ruled on the issue in the AI context. Albert said that music-generating AI companies could have a harder time proving fair use compared to chatbot makers, which can summarize and synthesize text in ways that courts may be more likely to consider transformative. Imagine a student using AI to generate a report about the U.S. Civil War that incorporates text from a novel on the subject, she said, compared to someone asking AI to create new music based on existing music. The student example certainly feels like a different purpose than logging onto a music-generating tool and saying hey, Id like to make a song that sounds like a top 10 artist, Albert said. The purpose is pretty similar to what the artist would have had in the first place. A Supreme Court ruling on fair use last year could have an outsized impact on music cases because it focused largely on whether a new use has the same commercial purpose as the original work. This argument is a key part of the Suno and Udio complaints, which said that the companies use the labels music for the ultimate purpose of poaching the listeners, fans, and potential licensees of the sound recordings they copied. Merritt said she worries technology companies could try to use AI to replace artists like her. If musicians songs can be extracted for free and used to imitate them, she said, the economics are straightforward. Robots and AI do not get royalties, she said. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "title": "Bangladesh declares three-day general holiday, indefinite curfew amid ongoing unrest",
        "date": "August 4, 2024 08:46 pm",
        "content": "(Reuters) - At least 73 people were killed and hundreds injured in clashes in Bangladesh on Sunday, as police fired tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse tens of thousands of protesters calling for Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina to resign. The government declared an indefinite nationwide curfew starting at 6 p.m. (1200 GMT) on Sunday, the first time it has taken such a step during the current protests that began last month. It also announced a three-day general holiday starting from Monday. The unrest, which has prompted the government to shut down internet services, is Hasinas biggest test in her 20-year regime after she won a fourth straight term in elections that were boycotted by the main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party. Critics of Hasina, along with human rights groups, have accused her government of using excessive force against protesters, a charge she and her ministers deny. Demonstrators blocked major highways on Sunday as student protesters launched a non-cooperation program to press for the governments resignation, and violence spread nationwide. Those who are protesting on the streets right now are not students, but terrorists who are out to destabilise the nation, Hasina said after a national security panel meeting, attended by the chiefs of the army, navy, air force, police and other agencies. I appeal to our countrymen to suppress these terrorists with a strong hand. Police stations and ruling party offices were targeted as violence rocked the country of 170 million people. Twelve policemen were beaten to death in the north-western district of Sirajganj, police official Bijoy Bosak said. At least eight people, including two students and a ruling party leader, were killed and dozens injured amid fierce clashes in several places in the capital, Dhaka, police and witnesses said. BULLET WOUNDS Two construction workers were killed on their way to work and 30 injured in the central district of Munsiganj, during a three-way clash of protesters, police and ruling party activists, witnesses said. They were brought dead to the hospital with bullet wounds, said Abu Hena Mohammad Jamal, the superintendent of the district hospital. Police said they had not fired any live bullets. In the northeastern district of Pabna, at least three people were killed and 50 injured during a clash between protesters and activists of Hasinas ruling Awami League party, witnesses said. Three people were killed in violence in the northern district of Bogura, and 53 were killed in 12 other districts, hospital officials said. An attack on a hospital is unacceptable, said Health Minister Samanta Lal Sen after a group vandalised a medical college hospital and set fire to vehicles, including an ambulance, in Dhaka. For the second time during the recent protests, the government shut down high-speed internet services, mobile operators said. Social media platforms Facebook and WhatsApp were not available, even via broadband connections. Bangladesh authorities instructed the countrys telecoms providers on Sunday to shut down 4G, effectively disabling internet services, according to a confidential government memo seen by Reuters. GOVERNMENT ORDERS You are requested to shut down all your 4G services until further notice, only 2G will be effective, said the document issued by the National Telecommunication Monitoring Center, a government intelligence agency. Telecoms companies were previously told their licences would be cancelled if they did not comply with government orders, a person with direct knowledge told Reuters. The telecom regulatory body did not respond to Reuters calls. Last month, at least 150 people were killed and thousands injured in violence touched off by student groups protesting against quotas for government jobs. The protests paused after the Supreme Court scrapped most quotas, but students returned to the streets in sporadic protests last week, demanding justice for the families of those killed. I think the genie is out of the bottle and Hasina may not put it back in the bottle again, said Shakil Ahmed, associate professor for government and politics at Jahangirnagar University. The prime minister should immediately form a national government to facilitate greater unity. Chief of Army Staff General Waker-Uz-Zaman on Saturday directed his officers to ensure the security of peoples lives, properties, and important state installations under any circumstances, a statement said. (The) Bangladesh Army is a symbol of the peoples trust. The army is always there and will always be there for the peoples interests and for any needs of the state, the statement quoted him as saying. He also urged officers to remain vigilant about various rumours circulating on social media and to execute their duties with honesty, integrity, and justice. Zaman will brief the media on Monday.

The hosts also claimed their first ODI win against the world no.1 India after 1,108 days with a 1-0 lead in three three-match series. Kamindu Mendis and Avishka Fernando helped Sri Lanka post a challenging total of 240 while batting first and then the experienced spinner Jeffrey Vandersy picked six wickets to bowl out India to 28 in 42.2 overs. Rohit Sharma scored another quick fifty to give India a stunning start while chasing a manageable target at R Premadasa Stadium. But the Men in Blues witnessed an embarrassing collapse from 970 to 1476 with Vandersay claiming all first six wickets in one of the best ODI spells in Sri Lanka cricket history. Sri Lanka last defeated India in an ODI game in July 2021 at the same venue and last won a bilateral series in August 1997. The Indian cricket team is waiting on their historic 100th ODI win against Sri Lanka to become the first team to achieve such a milestone and will look to claim it in the third ODI on Wednesday.

        "date": "August 5, 2024 11:40 am",
        "content": "Oil prices fell on Monday as fears of a recession in the United States, the worlds top oil consumer, offset concerns that escalating tensions in the Middle East may affect supplies from the largest producing region. Brent crude futures inched down 4 cents, or 0.1, to 76.77 a barrel by 0035 GMT, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures were at 73.39 a barrel, down 13 cents, or 0.2. Prices were supported by persistent fighting in Gaza with an Israeli airstrike hitting two schools and killing at least 30 people on Sunday, Palestinian officials said, the day after a round of talks in Cairo ended without result. Israel and the United States are bracing for a serious escalation in the region after Iran and its allies Hamas and Hezbollah pledged to retaliate against Israel for the killings of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh and Fuad Shukr, a top military commander from Lebanese armed group Hezbollah last week. If this conflict intensifies, crude exports could be impacted, ANZ analysts said in a note. Despite worries about escalating tensions in the Middle East, Brent tumbled more than 3 on Friday to settle at its lowest since January. WTI, meanwhile, fell more than 3 to settle at its lowest since June. Both contracts marked their fourth straight week of losses, their biggest losing streaks since November. Oil prices were dragged down by U.S. recession fears and after OPEC, an alliance between the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other producers such as Russia, stuck to its plan to phase out voluntary production cuts from October. The market had been expecting OPEC to delay the phase out of voluntary production cuts beyond the third quarter, ANZ analysts said. A Reuters survey showed on Friday that OPEC oil output rose in July despite production cuts by the group. In the U.S., the number of operating oil rigs were steady at 482 last week, Baker Hughes said in a weekly report. Weak economic data across the globe weighed on oil prices, on concerns that a sluggish global economic recovery would dampen fuel consumption. Data released last week showed that the U.S. economy added fewer jobs than expected last month while factories across the U.S., China and Europe grappled with tepid demand. Slumping diesel consumption in China, the worlds biggest contributor to oil demand growth, is weighing on global oil prices. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

Police have arrested ten suspects including the owner of the tattoo studio in Athurugiriya where the shooting incident took place on July 08 and a 21-year-old female on suspicion of having aided and abetted in the shooting incident. During the investigations carried out thus far, it has been revealed that the owner of the tattoo studio has received an amount of Rs. 1 million over a period of time. The shocking shooting incident had occurred during the opening ceremony of a tattoo and piercing studio near the Clock Tower in Athurugiriya on July 08. Six people were rushed to the hospital following the incident. Police later confirmed that 55-year-old businessman Surendra Wasantha Perera, popularly known as Club Wasantha, and a 38-year-old male had succumbed to their injuries. Popular singer K.

        "date": "August 5, 2024 12:36 pm",
        "content": "The Election Commission emphasizes that false information is circulating alleging that the voters registered in the voters list will be facilitated to cast their vote at any polling station in the island. Issuing a statement, the election regulatory body refuted these reports and said that the voters must vote at the polling station assigned to their registered constituency only, as per election regulations. Additionally, postal voters retain the option to cast their vote in the presence of their Certifying Officer, providing a measure of convenience for those unable to visit their designated polling station, the statement added. In preparation for the upcoming election, the Commission will send official ballot notices to registered voters. These notices will include the voters name, the address of the polling station where they are eligible to vote, and detailed voting instructions, the commission said. The Election Commission emphasizes that no one is allowed to vote in a polling station other than the polling station mentioned in the ballot notice. However, on July 26, the election commission had published an extraordinary gazette notification stating that a person who is reasonably fearful that he will not be able to go to and cast the vote at the given polling station, may request to be facilitated to vote at another polling station. The gazette notification highlighted that the provisions of Section 119B of the Presidential Elections Act, No. 15 of 1981, as amended by the Presidential Elections (Amendment) Act, No. 16 of 1988, have provided in this regard.",

        "date": "August 5, 2024 01:17 pm",
        "content": "An Israeli airstrike hit two schools in Gaza City on Sunday, killing at least 30 people, Palestinian officials said, while the Israeli military said it struck a Hamas military compound embedded in the schools. An Israeli airstrike hit a tent camp inside a hospital in central Gaza earlier in the day. Gaza health officials said a total of at least 44 Palestinians were killed on Sunday, the day after a round of talks in Cairo ended without result. Footage circulated on Palestinian media showed bodies scattered inside the yard of one of two blast-wrecked schools as residents rushed to carry casualties, including children, and loaded them into ambulance vehicles that took them to at least two nearby hospitals. Gazas Civil Emergency Service said dozens were wounded in addition to the fatalities in the schools of Hassan Salama and Al-Nasser, which housed Palestinian displaced families. The Israeli military said it struck militants inside a Hamas command embedded within the schools and that it took steps to reduce the risk to civilians there. Israel says the Islamist militant group Hamas regularly embeds in civilian institutions, using Gazas population as human shields. Hamas denies this. Earlier in the day, an Israeli strike inside the Al-Aqsa Hospital compound started a fire, and wounded at least 18 people as well as killing five, medical authorities said. The Israeli military said it struck a militant operating there and that secondary explosions were identified, indicating weapons were present in the area. The hospital compound is in Deir Al-Balah, an area crowded with thousands of people displaced by fighting in other parts of the enclave. Elsewhere in Deir Al-Balah, three Palestinians were killed when an Israeli missile struck a house. Separate Israeli strikes killed eight others inside their home in Jabalia camp in northern Gaza City and three inside a car. Residents in areas southeast of the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis and to the north of Rafah, where there was heavy fighting last month, reported receiving evacuation orders from the Israeli military. The Israeli army spokesman posted orders on X, asking residents of those districts to head towards the humanitarian zone, saying forces would soon act forcefully against militants waging attacks from those areas. In Israel, sirens went off in the area of Ashdod and the Israeli military said five rockets were launched from southern Gaza. No injuries were reported. Hamas said the rocket firing was in response to Israeli massacres against the civilians. ISRAEL BRACES FOR ESCALATION Israel is bracing for a serious escalation following the assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran on Wednesday, a day after an Israeli strike in Beirut killed Fuad Shukr, a top military commander from Lebanese armed group Hezbollah. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was due to convene special security discussions late on Sunday, a defence official said, following threats of retaliation from Iran and Hezbollah. Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said he was reviewing plans that would exact a price in the case of attempts by Iran and its proxies to attack Israel. Our readiness in terms of defense is high - be it on the ground or in the air, and we are prepared for both a swift response or attack. If they dare to attack us, they will pay a heavy price, Gallant said in a statement. Hamas and Iran have both accused Israel of carrying out the assassination of Haniyeh and have pledged to retaliate. Israel has neither claimed nor denied responsibility for the death. Hezbollah, like Hamas, is backed by Iran and has also vowed revenge after the killing of Shukr. The war was triggered by Hamas Oct. 7 attack on southern Israel, in which 1,200 people were killed and 250 taken hostage to Gaza, according to Israeli tallies. At least 39,550 Palestinians have been killed in the Israeli military campaign in Gaza, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between fighters and civilians. Palestinian health officials say most the fatalities have been civilians. Israel, which has lost around 330 soldiers in Gaza, says around a third of the Palestinian dead are fighters.

The demonstrations began with students seeking to end a quota system for government jobs, but clashes with police and pro-government activists escalated into violence that left more than 200 dead last month. That triggered more protests demanding accountability from the government, which have grown into calls for Ms Hasina, who has been leading the country since 2009, to step down.

        "content": "Sri Lankan all-rounder and Womens Team captain Chamari Athapaththu has been nominated for ICC Womens Player of the Month for July 2024 after leading her country to a historic maiden win in the Womens Asia Cup 2024 over seven-time champions India. Athapaththu has been nominated alongside the Indian duo of Smriti Mandhana and Shafali Verma. Chamari Athapaththu (Sri Lanka) Sri Lanka stalwart Chamari Athapaththu added another feather to her crown with a historic maiden win in the Womens Asia Cup 2024 over seven-time champions India in July. This triumph was yet another feat under her leadership in the last 12 months, a period in which Sri Lanka have set several milestones, including first-ever T20I series wins against England and South Africa and securing their qualification for the ICC Womens T20 World Cup 2024.. The backbone of Sri Lankas batting for several years now, Athapaththu was also the star in their undefeated Asia Cup run. After making just 12 in Sri Lankas first game against Bangladesh, Athapaththu responded in style, hitting a career-best 119 against Malaysia. An unbeaten 49 against Thailand in the final group game was followed by back-to-back and match-winning fifties against Pakistan (63) and India (61) in the tournament semi-final and final. Her 304 runs at a healthy strike rate of 146.85 wouldve been enough to secure a Player of the Tournament award, but the skipper also struck three times with the ball, including in the final against India. Already a two-time winner of the ICC Womens Player of the Month, Athapaththu now has a third award in her sights. Smriti Mandhana (India) Smriti Mandhana is nominated for the ICC Womens Player of the Month award for back-to-back months after winning the honour for June 2024. The opener continued her prolific run into July, beginning with a career-best 149 in the one-off Test against South Africa. Along with Shafali Verma, she added 292 runs for the first wicket, which was the highest-ever partnership for the first wicket in Womens Tests. India posted a mammoth total in the first innings courtesy of their stand and went on to win the game by 10 wickets. Mandhana followed this up with 100 runs from two innings in the T20I series against South Africa, including 54 in the final T20I which helped India win the contest by 10 wickets and square the series. Runs continued flowing in the Asia Cup, where Mandhana scored 173 runs and was the top-scorer for India in the final, getting 60 from 47 balls with 10 fours to her name. In all, Mandhana scored 273 runs at an average of 68.25 in T20Is with a strike rate of 139.28 in July. Shafali Verma (India) Indias other regular opener, Shafali Verma is the third nominee for July. The right-handed batter scored 229 Test runs and 245 T20I runs in the period. During her standout opening stand with Mandhana, Shafali became just the second Indian woman to hit a double century after Mithali Raj. She managed the feat in 194 balls, the fastest-ever double hundred in Womens Tests. Her 205 was the highest score as India posted a record total of 6036. This is the highest-ever total in Womens Tests. Shafali contributed further in the game with a wicket in the second innings, and a brisk 24 in the chase to give India an emphatic win. Shafali added 45 runs in the T20I leg against South Africa, before continuing her run-scoring habit in the Asia Cup. She was the second-highest run-getter in the tournament, with her 200 runs coming at an impressive strike rate of 140.84. Some of her memorable performances in the tournament included a quickfire 40 from 29 which helped set the chase against arch-rivals Pakistan, and a career-best 81 from 48, with 12 fours and a six against Nepal.

        "date": "August 5, 2024 06:24 pm",
        "content": "After 10 days in theaters, Deadpool  Wolverine is already the highest-grossing R-rated movie ever, not accounting for inflation. In its second weekend, the Marvel Studios blockbuster starring Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman continued to steamroll through movie theaters, collecting 97 million according to studio estimates Sunday. That raised its two-week total to 395.6 million, pushing it past the long-reigning top R-rated feature, The Passion of the Christ, which held that mark for 20 years with 370 million domestic. Worldwide, the Shawn Levy-directed Deadpool  Wolverine has quickly amassed 824.1 million in ticket sales, a total that already surpasses the global hauls of the first two Deadpool films. The 2016 original grossed 782.6 million worldwide; the 2018 sequel collected 734.5 million. The weekends primary challengers both struggled. M. Night Shyamalans latest thriller, Trap, managed a modest opening of 15.6 million at 3,181 theaters for Warner Bros. The film, starring Josh Hartnett as a serial killer hunted by police at a pop concert, didnt screen for critics before opening day and scored lower in reviews (48 fresh on Rotten Tomatoes) than Shyamalans films typically do. Audiences gave it a C CinemaScore. With a budget of about 35 million that Shyamalan largely finances himself, Trap didnt need a huge opening. But it may struggle to break even. This is a soft opening for an M. Night Shyamalan suspense crime thriller, wrote David A. Gross, a film consultant who publishes a newsletter for Franchise Entertainment. The writerdirectors movies out-earn other original thrillers by a wide margin, and thats true here, but this start is not on the level of recent Shyamalan films. The live-action Harold and the Purple Crayon, adapted from the classic kids book, also didnt make much of a mark in theaters. Th,e Sony Pictures release debuted with 6 million. It, too, got dinged by critics (28 fresh on Rotten Tomatoes), though audiences (an A- CinemaScore) liked it more. Harold and the Purple Crayon, which stars Zachary Levi, cost about 40 million to make. Twisters, the Universal Pictures disaster film, continues to kick up a storm at the box office. It held in second place with 22.7 million in its third weekend. Lee Isaac Chungs sequel to the 1996 original, starring Glen Powell, Daisy Edgar-Jones and Anthony Ramos, has racked up 195.6 million domestically. While it has made less of an impression overseas, Twisters is holding particularly well in North American theaters, down just 35 from the week prior. Hollywood closed July with its best month in a year and its first 1 billion month since July 2023. While comparisons to last year arent favorable  July was when Barbie and Oppenheimer launched  a pair of Walt Disney Co. releases in Inside Out 2 and Deadpool  Wolverine (the two top films of the year) powered a banner month for the movie industry. There will still reminders, though, of harder times in cinemas earlier in the spring and early summer, when a sparse release calendar and a few notable flops put the box office at a deficit. On Friday, AMC Theatres, the largest North American chain, posted a 32.8 million loss for the second quarter of 2024. Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore. Final domestic figures will be released Monday. 1. Deadpool  Wolverine, 97 million. 2. Twisters, 22.7 million. 3. Trap, 15.6 million. 4. Despicable Me 2, 11.3 million. 5. Inside Out 2, 6.7 million. 6. Harold and the Purple Crayon, 6 million. 7. Longlegs, 4.1 million. 8. A Quiet Place: Day One, 1.4 million. 9. Daaru Na Peenda Hove, 615,782. 10. Bad Boys: Ride or Die, 600,000. Source: AP --Agencies",

        "content": "Elon Musk has revived a lawsuit against ChatGPT maker OpenAI and its CEO Sam Altman on Monday, saying that the firm put profits and commercial interests ahead of the public good. The new lawsuit is the latest attempt by Musk to oppose the company he co-founded in 2015. He alleges that once OpenAIs technology started to transform generative artificial intelligence, Altman flipped the narrative and proceeded to cash in. The suit seeks a judicial determination that OpenAIs license to Microsoft to use its AI models is null and void. Musk also contends that the OpenAIs language models are outside the scope of the companys partnership with Microsoft. OpenAI has a licensing partnership with Microsoft, under which the big tech giant invests billions of dollars into the startup in exchange for using its large language models for its computing services. In June, Musk withdrew an earlier lawsuit against OpenAI and Altman that had accused them of abandoning the startups original mission to develop artificial intelligence for the benefit of humanity rather than for profit.

Disappointed by the strong public sentiment against her government despite her efforts to transform the country, she has decided to quit, Sajeeb Wajed Joy said at BBCs World Services Newshour program. She has turned Bangladesh around. When she took over power it was considered a failing state. It was a poor country. Until today it was considered one of the rising tigers of Asia, Mr Joy said. Over the last month, more than 300 people died in Bangladesh amid violent protests, which though started over quota, shortly transformed into a call for the Prime Minister to step down. Sheikh Hasinas critics accused her not just of corruption and nepotism but also high-handedness and curtailing of civil liberties. These, many alleged, overshadowed the economic progress and development she had brought about. Her son rejected allegations that the government had been heavy-handed in dealing with the protestors as well. You have had policemen beaten to death - 13 just yesterday. So what do you expect the police to do when mobs are beating people to death? he said. Sheikh Hasina had been considering resigning since Sunday and had left the country for her own safety after her family insisted, he added. Source: NDTV --Agencies",

        "content": "Families of political prisoners secretly jailed in Bangladesh under the autocratic rule of ousted premier Sheikh Hasina waited desperately Tuesday for news of their relatives, as some of those missing were released. We need answers, said Sanjida Islam Tulee, a coordinator of Mayer Daak, meaning The Call of the Mothers, a group campaigning for the release of people detained by Hasinas security forces. Rights groups accused Hasinas security forces of abducting and disappearing some 600 people -- including many from the main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party and the banned Jamaat-e-Islami, the countrys largest Islamist party. Tulee told AFP that at least 20 families gathered outside a military intelligence force building in a northern Dhaka neighbourhood, waiting for news of their relatives. Army chief General Waker-Uz-Zaman announced Monday that Hasina had resigned after weeks of deadly protests, and the military would form a caretaker government. Hours later President Mohammed Shahabuddin -- after a meeting with the army chief -- said it had been decided to free all those arrested during the student protests, as well as key opposition leader Khaleda Zia. Ex-prime minister Zia, 78, chairperson of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) is in poor health and was largely under house arrest after being sentenced to 17 years in prison for graft in 2018. Among the most high profile of those released on Tuesday was opposition activist and lawyer Ahmad Bin Quasem, son of Mir Quasem Ali, the executed leader of Jamaat-e-Islami. He was released from secret detention this morning, family friend and relative Masum Khalili told AFP. He had a medical check-up, his condition is stable. Quasem, a British-educated barrister, was abducted -- allegedly by security forces in plainclothes -- in August 2016. Security forces during Hasinas rule were accused of detaining tens of thousands of opposition activists, killing hundreds in extrajudicial encounters, and disappearing their leaders and supporters. Human Rights Watch last year said security forces had committed over 600 enforced disappearances since Hasina came to power in 2009, and nearly 100 remain unaccounted for. Hasinas government denied the allegations of disappearances and extrajudicial killings, saying some of those reported missing drowned in the Mediterranean while trying to reach Europe. We heard Ahmad Bin Quasem has been released, Tulee said, but what happened to others? Source: AFP --Agencies",

        "content": "Police have questioned a Grade 8 student concerning a recent incident in which the music room at his school in Anamaduwa was almost completely destroyed in a fire. In addition to this student, another student from the same school is also suspected of being involved in the suspected arson incident. The music room of the school was gutted in a fire which broke out on August 04 while the principal and several other teachers from the school had managed to control the fire and prevent it from spreading further to other buildings. Police have initiated an investigation to determine whether the fire was caused by electrical short or if it was the result of an act of arson. It has then been revealed that a student had entered the school premises through the fence at the back of the school in the afternoon on that day. Further interrogation of the student in question have revealed that a window of the music room was accidently broken by a stone thrown at a wood apple tree. When inquired by Ada Dearana, a high ranking officer of Anamaduwa Police stated that the student is currently being interrogated in connection with the incident. Anamaduwa Police is scheduled to present facts before the court today (06) to seek legal advice from the court before proceeding with the arrest of the suspected student and the other student who is also believed to be involved.",

        "title": "Flintoff reveals nightmares of Top Gear crash",
        "date": "August 6, 2024 05:04 pm",
        "content": "The former England all-rounder sustained serious facial injuries in a crash while filming Top Gear in December 2022. Now the 46-year-old has spoken publicly for the first time about the incident and its aftermath as part of the second series of Freddie Flintoffs Field of Dreams, which begins on BBC One on 13 August (21:00 BST). I dont know what completely better is, said Flintoff in scenes filmed at the beginning of this year. I am what I am now. Im different to what I was. Its something I will have to deal with for the rest of my life. Better? No, different. One of the most famous cricketers England has produced, Flintoff played 79 Tests between 1998 and 2009. He played a pivotal role in the epic Ashes triumph of 2005, after which he was named BBC Sports Personality of the Year. I should not be here Known as Freddie, Flintoff moved into TV presenting at the end of his cricket career and fronted Top Gear from 2019 until the crash three years later. In the first series of Field of Dreams, aired in 2022, Flintoff returned to his hometown of Preston to assemble a cricket team of teenagers that had never played the game before. The second series centres on taking the team on a tour of India and began filming before Flintoffs accident. The crash occurred 12 weeks before the tour was scheduled to take place. In the documentary, Flintoff is shown a week and a half after the accident in footage he shot himself on his phone. It reveals the initial extent of his facial injuries. I genuinely should not be here with what happened, he said. Its going to be a long road back and Ive only just started. Im going to need help. I really am. Im not the best at asking for it. Im looking forward to seeing the lads. I really am. This India trip is going to be for me as much as them now. Im determined. I really want to go. In the end, the tour would have to be delayed until 2024. Seven months after the accident, in the summer of 2023, Flintoff was visited by close friend and fellow coach Kyle Hogg. The exchange between the two, captured in the documentary, is Flintoffs first explanation of the impact the accident had on him. By that stage, Flintoff had undergone a number of operations on his face and rarely left his home. When he did it was with a full face mask and glasses. Its been so hard to cope with I thought I could just shake it off, said Flintoff. I wanted to shake it off and say everythings all right, but its not been the case. Its been a lot harder than I thought. As much as I wanted to go out and do things, Ive just not been able to. I struggle with anxiety. I have nightmares, I have flashbacks. Its been so hard to cope with. Flintoff eventually met the cricket team six months later - 13 months after the accident - to resume planning for the tour of India, which finally took place earlier this year. Filming of Top Gear was halted following Flintoffs accident. In March 2023 the BBC apologised to Flintoff, who agreed in October of the same year a package of compensation, reported by The Sun to be 9m. In November 2023 the BBC confirmed Top Gear would not return for the foreseeable future. In September 2023, Flintoff returned to cricket in the coaching staff of the England white-ball team. He remained part of the set-up through to the T20 World Cup in June, where England were beaten in the semi-finals. He is currently in his first full-time head coach position, with Northern Superchargers in The Hundred. Youre coaching people - not players Speaking at the launch of the new series of the documentary, Flintoff said the show aided his coaching education. I learned a bit about coaching, he said. Ultimately youre coaching people, youre not coaching players. Thats something Ill take away in my career, whatever that leads to next. I suppose I found a confidence in India that had been lacking in recent times. Id love to do more coaching. I dont know in what entity. Im quite open-minded about it all, then a little bit of TV as well. This has been the perfect introduction back into coaching. Flintoffs sons, 18-year-old Corey and Rocky, 16, made their debuts for Lancashires second XI earlier this year. Rocky has since signed professional terms with the county, made his debut for England Under-19s and became Lancashires youngest ever first-team player when he lined up against Kent in the One-Day Cup in July.

        "title": "If Sheikh Hasina had done it long ago, she would still be PM  President Ranil on Bangladesh crisis",
        "date": "August 6, 2024 05:05 pm",
        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe says that if ousted Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina had released former PM Khalida Zia from jail long ago, she would still be the countrys Prime Minister. Addressing the Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) Summit 2024 held in Colombo today (06), Wickremesinghe stated that he welcomes the fact that Khalida Zia had been released from jail. However, the Sri Lankan leader did offer some words of praise to Hasina, who has now fled the country, as she had offered assistance to Sri Lanka during the financial crisis. Speaking further he said: Just think of the countries that are worse off than us. Think of a country like Bangladesh, which is in turmoil. I dont want to speak about the politics of Bangladesh, a friendly country, but it had to erupt at some time. While Sheikh Hasina has left, I still remember her because she gave us 200 million when we were really in need of money. So I think its only fair to say some good word about a person whos really down at the moment. I also welcome the fact that Khalida Zia had been released from jail. If Sheikh Hasina had done it long ago, she would have still been Prime Minister. Lets hope theres tranquility in Bangladesh. I have no doubt there will be tranquility, he added. Meanwhile, President Wickremesinghe outlined Sri Lankas commitment to achieving sustainable development goals and reaching net zero carbon emissions by 2040. The president highlighted several rapid methods to achieve these objectives, including harnessing renewable energy, modernizing agriculture, and addressing water shortages. The president emphasized that attracting global financial facilities through commercial investments is a key part of Sri Lankas strategy. He detailed plans to transform the plantation sector into agribusinesses, promote sustainable tourism, and enhance product improvement and digitization. The conference, held under the theme Sustainable Pathways for a Brighter Future, features presentations from approximately 15 experts in environment, society, and governance, who are sharing crucial knowledge and innovative solutions for achieving sustainability. During the event, President Wickremesinghe presented the ESG Excellence Awards to micro, small, and medium-scale entrepreneurs, recognizing their contributions to environmental, social, and governance initiatives. Addressing the gathering the President further elaborated: I must thank you for taking up the ESG on which you have been holding your conferences for the last three years. Its good because you have to learn how the world is changing, especially the private sector and commitment to economic, social, and governance. We have to push it further. And I think we are the best of all the countries in South Asia to do so. The Maldives is like us but a bit too small. The rest, I dont think they are ready. So we must be the first. But while I commend the private sector globally and here for moving in this direction, you must also remember the geopolitical situation in the world today seems to be coming in the other direction. All the hurrah of the SDGs and of the Paris Climate Summit and even Glasgow have got stuck. We have not made very much progress since then. And the situation also is not good. The world is still recovering from COVID-19, a year or two. The Chinese economy is not performing at its best. It will take a few more years. Even the US economy, they talked of a boom, but they have talked now that the job market is disappearing. So we should look at the two major economies in the world. You cant say this very much of Europe either. I mean, they are going ahead, but there are problems. So its going to take a few more years. So its in this background that we are looking at the Sustainable Development Goals. How do we achieve them? For us, where are the funds? How many countries can spend money on this? And you see a turnaround, well, how ESG will be treated, and the approach if Trump becomes president, is an open question. But more disturbing was what happened in the UK. Under Boris Johnson, the Glasgow Conference and the Principals were welcomed by everyone. Within two years, his own successor, Rishi Sunak, had gone back on everything just to get the right-wing vote from reform which he failed also. Today we have a new government in the UK who want to turn it back but remember UK no longer has the money. We have been talking of all the funds that we are to get. We talk at COP 27, 28, 29. This time I am going to wear a hat and go there because each time they mention this, I will raise my hat because its like an old friend passing me by. I dont think theres anything more you could do but therell be a good fight there. How much money are we giving? We went to Paris for the debt meeting, but results are still not out yet. And to make it worse, I dont know how the Paris assembly would react to it. But where is the money? They are short of money. In the meantime, the US alone has spent more money on Ukraine and Israel. I think that money could have helped us out. Then take what Europe is now giving on this. And we dont know how much Russia has spent. So all that money could have been used. Its not being done. Secondly, the Middle East situation is such, Iran seems to be wanting to retaliate. To retaliate is going to be bad for everyone, including Sri Lanka. I have just got a paper on the repercussions. I dont think anyone would like to read it. Just think of the countries that are worse off than us. Think of a country like Bangladesh, which is in turmoil. I dont want to speak about the politics of Bangladesh, a friendly country, but it had to erupt at some time. While Sheikh Hasina has left, I still remember her because she gave us 200 million when we were really in need of money. So I think its only fair to say some good word about a person whos really down at the moment. I also welcome the fact that Khalida Zia had been released from jail. If Sheikh Hasina had done it long ago, she would have still been Prime Minister. Lets hope theres tranquility in Bangladesh. I have no doubt there will be tranquility. We should not panic. We are the largest investors; we are providing jobs in that country. So having said that, the world situation per se is not good. But that doesnt mean that Sri Lanka is moving out of it. In this global context, steps have been taken to establish the International Climate Change University on 600 acres in Sri Lanka, with legislative work planned by early next year. The Tropical Regions Initiative aims to use tropical regions and the Indian Ocean for carbon absorption, focusing on commercial investments. Sri Lanka is striving to meet sustainable development goals and achieve zero emissions by 2040 through renewable energy, modernizing agriculture, and addressing water scarcity issues. To this end, attracting global financial facilities through commercial investments is key. The transformation from plantation businesses to agribusiness, promotion of sustainable tourism, and product improvement and digitization are main objectives. Additionally, four new technical universities are being established to support technical education and innovation.",

        "title": "Berkshire Hathaways Apple stake cut sparks major tech sell-off",
        "date": "August 6, 2024 05:23 pm",
        "content": "Apple and Nvidia spearheaded a significant sell-off in technology stocks on Monday as US recession concerns and Berkshire Hathaways decision to cut its stake in Apple ended a months-long rally in the sector. High-performing shares of Alphabet Amazon, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, and Tesla, along with Apple and Nvidia, fell by as much as 6.5. This drop in the Magnificent Seven stocks threatened to wipe out nearly 900 billion from their combined market value. Chip stocks, which had been Wall Streets favourites in the AI trade, also tumbled. Advanced Micro Devices, Intel, Super Micro Computer , and Broadcom fell as much as 7.8. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index was down nearly 3. The share slide followed a weak US payrolls report on Friday, pushing investors globally towards safer assets and spurring bets that the Federal Reserve might soon cut interest rates to aid growth. Over the weekend, Warren Buffetts Berkshire Hathaway announced it had halved its stake in Apple, raising concerns about the tech industrys outlook. After leading gains on Wall Street for over a year, big technology stocks have come under pressure recently. Signs that the payoff from hefty AI investments would take longer than expected have contributed to the decline. Earnings reports from Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet have also sowed doubts that their margins could be hit by the billions spent on AI. Expectations have arguably become too high for the so-called Magnificent Seven group of companies. Their success has made them untouchable in the eyes of investors and when they fall short of greatness, out come the knives, said Dan Coatsworth, an investment analyst at AJ Bell. Despite the sell-off, Nvidia shares have nearly doubled in value this year after rising more than 200 in 2023. Other Magnificent Seven stocks, except Tesla, are also in positive territory for 2024. Some analysts suggested that Mondays slide could offer investors an opportunity to buy shares of the big technology firms at better valuations, highlighting the expected long-term returns from generative AI investments and their strong market positions. Our playbook for 24 years covering tech stocks on the Street is to handhold investors through the panic and irrational global sell-offs to own the best tech names and winners driving the growth themes, said Dan Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities. Warren Buffetts Berkshire Hathaway, meanwhile, is now sitting on nearly 277 billion in cash, up from a record 189 billion three months earlier. This increase in cash came as Berkshire posted a record quarterly profit from its dozens of operating businesses. Second-quarter operating profit rose 15 to 11.6 billion, or about 8,073 per Class A share, from 10.04 billion a year earlier, with nearly half coming from underwriting and investments in Berkshires insurance businesses. Net income fell 15 to 30.34 billion from 35.91 billion a year earlier.

        "title": "Kamala Harris picks Minnesota governor Tim Walz for vice president",
        "date": "August 6, 2024 06:52 pm",
        "content": "Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris selected Minnesota Governor Tim Walz to be her running mate on Tuesday, choosing a progressive policy champion and a plain speaker from Americas heartland to help win over rural, white voters, said people familiar with the matter. Walz, a 60-year-old U.S. Army National Guard veteran and former teacher, was elected to a Republican-leaning district in the U.S. House of Representatives in 2006 and served 12 years before being elected governor of Minnesota in 2018. As governor, Walz has pushed a progressive agenda that includes free school meals, goals for tackling climate change, tax cuts for the middle class and expanded paid leave for Minnesota workers. Walz has long advocated for womens reproductive rights but also displayed a conservative bent while representing a rural district in the U.S. House, defending agricultural interests and backing gun rights. Harris, the daughter of immigrants from Jamaica and India, is adding a popular Midwestern politician whose home state votes reliably for Democrats in presidential elections but is close to Wisconsin and Michigan, two crucial battlegrounds. Such states are seen as crucial in deciding this years election, and Walz is widely seen as skilled at connecting with white, rural voters who in recent years have voted broadly for the Republican Donald Trump, Harris rival for the White House. The Harris campaign hopes Walzs extensive National Guard career, coupled with a successful run as a high school football coach, and his Dad joke videos, opens new tab will attract such voters who are not yet dedicated to a second Trump term in the White House. Harris, 59, has revived the Democratic Partys hopes of an election victory since becoming its candidate after President Joe Biden, 81, ended his failing reelection bid under party pressure on July 21. Walz was a relative unknown nationally until the Harris veepstakes heated up, but his profile has since surged. A popular member of Congress, he reportedly had the backing of powerful former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who was instrumental in persuading Biden to leave the race. Harris and Walz will face Trump and his running mate JD Vance, also a military veteran from the Midwest, in a Nov. 5 election. Stumping for Harris, sometimes in a camouflage baseball hat and T-shirt, Walz has attacked Trump and Vance as weird, a catchy insult that has been picked up by the Harris campaign, social media and Democratic activists. A UNICORN Walz gave the nascent Harris campaign the new attack line in a late July interview: These are weird people on the other side: They want to take books away. They want to be in your exam room, referring to book bans and womens reproductive consultations with doctors. Walz has also attacked the claims by Trump and Vance of having middle class credentials. They keep talking about the middle class. A robber baron real estate guy and a venture capitalist trying to tell us they understand who we are? They dont know who we are, Walz said in an MSNBC interview. That approach has struck a chord with the young voters Harris needs to reengage. David Hogg, the co-founder of the gun safety group March for Our Lives, described him as a great communicator. Walz is somewhat of a unicorn, said Ryan Dawkins, a political science professor at Minnesotas Carleton College - a man born in a small town in rural Nebraska capable of conveying Harris message to core Democratic voters, and those that the party has failed to reach in recent years. Dawkins praised his ability to connect with rural voters. It is a group the Biden administration has tried to reach with infrastructure spending and other pragmatic policies, but with little show of messaging success so far. In the 2016 election, Trump won 59 of rural voters; in 2020 that number rose to 65 even though Trump lost the election, according to Pew Research. In the 2022 governors race, Walz won with 52.27 to his Republican opponents 44.61, although swaths of rural Minnesota voted for the opponent. While Walz has supported Democratic Party orthodoxy on issues ranging from legalized abortion and same-sex marriage to the Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare, he also racked up a centrist voting record during his congressional career. He was a staunch defender of government support for farmers and military veterans, as well as gun-owner rights that won praise from the National Rifle Association, according to The Almanac of American Politics. He subsequently registered a failing grade with the NRA after supporting gun-control measures during his first campaign for governor. Walzs shift from a centrist representing a single rural district in Congress to a more progressive politician as governor may have been in response to the demands of voters in major cities like Minneapolis-St. Paul. But it leaves him open to Republican attacks, Dawkins said in a telephone interview. He runs the risk of reinforcing some of the worst fears people have of Kamala Harris being a San Francisco liberal, Dawkins said. Walz has a ready counter-attack. What a monster. Kids are eating and having full bellies, so they can go learn and women are making their own healthcare decisions, Walz said in a July CNN interview. So if thats where they want to label me, Im more than happy to take the label. As the states top executive, Walz mandated the use of face coverings during the COVID-19 pandemic and signed a law making marital rape illegal. He presided over several years of budget surpluses in Minnesota on the road to his 2022 reelection. During that campaign, Walz touted the backing of several influential labor unions, including the state AFL-CIO, firefighters, Service Employees International Union (SEIU), teachers and others. His tenure was marked by the May 2020 killing of George Floyd, a Black man, by a white Minneapolis police officer who was convicted of murder. Walz assigned the states attorney general to lead the prosecution in the case, saying people dont believe justice can be served. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "content": "The agreement for obtaining USD 300 million loan from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for the implementation of power sector reforms and financial sustainability program has been signed by the Government of Sri Lanka and the ADB. The Government of Sri Lanka had discussions with the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to mobilize three policy-based loans (PBL) amounting to USD 300 million to implement the Power Sector Reforms and Financial Sustainability Program. The relevant Power Sector Reforms and Financial Sustainability Program, consists of three subprograms and a loan of USD 100 million will be mobilized once the policy actions relevant for each of the subprograms are completed, according to the ADB. The Program will support the establishment of independent and financially sustainable electricity utilities. Also, it will support streamlined and accelerated development of renewable energy sources for electricity generation under the reform areas. The Ministry of Finance, Economic Stabilization and National Policies will be the Executing Agency of the above Program and the Ministry of Power and Energy will implement the Program, in collaboration with the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB), Sri Lanka Sustainable Energy Authority (SLSEA) and Lanka Electricity Company Pvt Ltd (LECO). Since the relevant agencies have successfully achieved all pre-policy actions related to Subprogram 01, the relevant loan proceeds of USD 100 million will be disbursed to the Treasury once the loan agreement declared effective. The loan will be provided under concessionary terms at a fixed interest rate of 2.0 per year with a repayment period of 25-years, including a 5-year grace period. The loan agreement for the policy-based lending for Subprogram 01 was signed between the Government of Sri Lanka and the Asian Development Bank on 05 August 2024 at the Treasury in Colombo.

        "content": "The Committee on Public Accounts (COPA) has expressed its displeasure over the performance of the Buildings Department and Ayurveda Department, when the committee met in Parliament recently under the Chairmanship of the State Minister Lasantha Alagiyawanna. The Committee Chair has pointed out during the meeting that COPA maintains a data system regarding the performance of government institutions under its purview and according to that data, the Building Department and the Ayurveda Department have been identified as the two institutions with the lowest performance. As a result, it was decided to summon both these institutions before the Committee on one day, the Committee Chair further mentioned, the Parliamentary Communications Department said. The Auditor Generals reports and current performance of the Building Department for the financial years 2020 and 2021 and the Ayurvedic Department for the financial years 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021 and 2022 were examined at the Committee meeting held, it added. The Committee pointed out to the officials that the building department has a major role to play in preparing the building rate schedule (BSR) for construction and there is a concern as to whether it is being done properly. Thus, the officials pointed out that the website of the building department states that any government agency can get this service through the building department and accordingly the service will be provided to the parties who request the service. But they pointed out that their organization has not received any guidance that this service must be provided. Accordingly, the Committee recommended officials to take some action within a month after discussing this with the Ministry of Finance. Furthermore, attention was paid to the matters mentioned in the Auditor Generals reports regarding the Department of Ayurveda and the Committee expressed its displeasure regarding the performance of both these institutions. Members of Parliament for this Committee, Sivagnanam Shritharan, J. C.
