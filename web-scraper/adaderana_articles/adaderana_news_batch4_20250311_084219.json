        "date": "April 10, 2024 02:34 pm",
        "content": "The Hambantota International Port (HIP), in a landmark move, inaugurated its container transshipment service operated by the Mediterranean Shipping Company (MSC). MV MSC Ingrid made her maiden call at HIP on Tuesday (09), discharging a total of 500 plus TEUs of transshipment containers to be connected to a second carrier, MSC Sky 11, expected to make a port call on 16 April. The first shipment of containers consigned to the regional multipurpose port on the east-west shipping route, originated from the Rotterdam Port and will reach its final destination, Dubai via the second carrier. Commenting in this regard, Johnson Liu, Chief Representative of China Merchants Group in Sri Lanka and CEO of Hambantota International Port Group (HIPG) expressed confidence that HIPG container transshipment service would enhance Sri Lankas position in the marine connectivity index for the South Asian region. With MSCs collaborative partnership, HIPG will now look at expanding our investment in equipment and other infra-structure facilities, enabling us to service larger vessels on the east west shipping route. We plan to make optimal use of HIPs strategic location, capacity and expertise, to deliver the full potential the port is capable of, doing our part to enhance Sri Lankas regional hub status. He thanked Minister of Ports, Shipping and Aviation Nimal Siripala de Silva for the support and cooperation extended to HIP in granting the required approval and giving necessary direction to his officials to facilitate the shipping connectivity between HIP and the Port of Colombo (POC). Through this approval, local importers and exporters would be able to make direct shipments andor transshipment of cargo to and from HIP to POC and vice-versa. Given the climate change environmental concerns in the logistics and supply chain industry, the shipping connectivity between the two ports is expected to make a significant impact in reducing greenhouse gas emissions as opposed to road transport. The Hambantota International Port has placed itself in an ideal position to provide sought-after solutions needed by the industry. The port is currently developing on five silos, to ensure enhanced service value and necessary synergies, while placing emphasis on stringent rules for health and safety, the HIP said in a press release.",

        "date": "April 10, 2024 03:45 pm",
        "content": "British physicist Peter Higgs, whose theory of a mass-giving particle  the so-called Higgs boson  jointly earned him the Nobel Prize for Physics, has died aged 94, the University of Edinburgh announced on Tuesday. He passed away peacefully at home on Monday 8 April following a short illness, the Scottish university, where he had been a professor for nearly five decades, said in a statement. It called him a great teacher and mentor, inspiring generations of young scientists. His family has asked that the media and public respect their privacy at this time, the university added. Higgs used ground-breaking theoretical work to help explain how the Universe has mass, thus resolving one of the greatest puzzles in physics and earning him a place alongside Albert Einstein and Max Planck in textbooks. His 1964 theory of a mass-giving particle, which became known as the Higgs boson or the God particle, won him and Belgian physicist Francois Englert the 2013 physics Nobel Prize. That followed experiments at the Large Hadron Collider at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) finally confirming the theory the previous year, nearly half a century on. Peter Higgs was a remarkable individual - a truly gifted scientist whose vision and imagination have enriched our knowledge of the world that surrounds us, Peter Mathieson, Vice Chancellor of the University of Edinburgh, said. His pioneering work has motivated thousands of scientists, and his legacy will continue to inspire many more for generations to come. Source: AFP -Agencies",

        "date": "April 10, 2024 04:18 pm",
        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe has affirmed his commitment to empowering the people and fortifying the economy by ensuring access to education, land, housing, and business opportunities. Stressing the importance of broadening economic participation, the Head of State highlighted its role in fostering a resilient national economy. These remarks were made on Tuesday afternoon (09) during his presence at the national event in Modara. As many as 294 units at Randiya Uyana housing complex were thus allocated to those displaced by the massive fire in Kajimawatte in 2010. Addressing the gathering, President Wickremesinghe said: As I addressed you today, my heart goes out to the resilient residents of Kajimawatte, who have endured over a decade of unimaginable hardships. It was a poignant moment as we swiftly provided these flats, with Mr. Ravi Karunanayakes unwavering support. Its my earnest request that you handle these houses with care and responsibility. Please refrain from mortgaging or selling them, especially after enduring a decade of hardship. I urge you to safeguard these homes as if they were your own life. Within two years, weve managed to cultivate a social atmosphere that feels considerably lighter than it did back in 2022. Those who endured the hardships of waiting in lines for food, gas, and fuel now lead lives of relative normalcy. Its evident that the people of Colombo bore the brunt of these queues, alongside residents of flats and estates who faced their own challenges. I acknowledge that our tax policies have added to the cost of living, but thanks to your resilience, weve been able to bolster government revenues without resorting to borrowing or printing money. This achievement enabled us to raise government employee salaries by Rs. 10,000 starting this year, while also witnessing a strengthening of the rupee. I perceive the offering of free land deeds and homes to those who have endured hardship as a gesture of gratitude. Looking ahead, we have plans to provide over 50,000 houses to our people in the coming years. Additionally, the 1,996 houses provided by the Chinese government during my tenure as Prime Minister will also be distributed within the next two years. Historically, land rights and housing rights were not granted without cost. However, we aim to change this narrative by empowering our citizens with the rights to education, land, housing, and business. This strategic approach will enable individuals to directly contribute to our nations economy, fostering growth and prosperity for all. --PMD",

        "title": "Counting underway in South Koreas parliamentary elections",
        "date": "April 10, 2024 05:05 pm",
        "content": "Vote counting is underway in South Korea as the country awaits the results of its parliamentary elections. The election is widely seen as a midterm referendum on President Yoon Suk Yeols administration, who still has three years left in office. His People Power Party (PPP) has struggled to achieve its agenda in a legislature dominated by the opposition Democratic Party (DPK). Mr Yoon is under pressure to address a number of issues including rising food prices, a rapidly aging population and an ongoing doctors strike. Exit polls are projecting that the opposition will secure a majority of the 300-seat parliament, though such polls have proved inaccurate in the past. In recent weeks, Mr Yoon been criticised for appearing to be out of touch with voters inflation woes. But the opposition has also faced similar criticism. If the exit polls prove accurate and the PPP fails to secure a strong representation, Mr Yoon could leave office with little to show for his time, other than his foreign policy achievements. His major success has been building up relations with Japan and the US to counter China and North Korea. But that will have little bearing on this election. South Koreans will be voting in line with their wallets more than anything. The president, whose approval rating has been falling for months, has also battled a series of political scandals since he was elected in March 2022. A hot mic caught him swearing in September that year after a meeting with US President Joe Biden in New York. His wife Kim Keon Hee has been embroiled in a controversy for allegedly accepting a luxury bag gift, while separate corruption and abuse of power allegations have been levelled at senior members of his party. Most pressingly for voters however may be cost-of-living concerns. Just last month, Mr Yoon drew flak for a visit to a Seoul grocery store where he commented that a bundle of green onions priced at 875 won (0.65) was reasonable - when the item had been priced by the store at a discount due to subsidies. The item would have otherwise been typically priced between 3,000 won and 4,000 won. Mr Yoons comments sparked a backlash, with farmers organising sit-in protests with bundles of green onions. The vegetable also started to appear at the DPKs election rallies. However the main opposition party has also been beleaguered by its own political controversies and internal struggles, and has also faced corruption allegations. Voter discontent with both major parties could create a window of opportunity for new smaller parties and potentially a more multi-party legislature, analysts say. We do have many smaller parties contesting this election which is pretty extraordinary. There are 38 smaller parties registered for the proportional seats, said Eunjung Lim, an associate professor at Kongju National University. But she added that, even with voter disillusionment, the main competition remains between the PPP and the DPK, neither of whom have offered strong policy solutions to the cost-of-living crisis. The major concern for Korean voters is inflation... especially groceries. Those prices are deeply related to ordinary peoples lives. At a polling station in Seoul on Wednesday, voters were most concerned about the cost of living. I need to buy an apartment, so I need the prices to come down, but I cant see things improving, said Kim Hyeon-seo, a recently married finance worker. An 81-year-old pensioner, Kim Geun-su, said he was struggling with the price of food. People like me are having a tough time, the prices are too high. I buy a few things with my welfare payments and then theres nothing left, he said. Others voiced frustration about how combative politics in South Korea has become. During the campaign, politicians have focused more on tearing down their opponents than on addressing Koreas problems. I hope the leaders will not fight, and will instead work together to lead this country, said 85-year-old Hong Ok-sun. Voters cast one ballot for their representatives in the National Assembly - which makes up 254 seats in the 300-seat parliament. They also vote for a political party, which then allocates the share of the remaining 46 proportional representation seats to party members. The results, likely to be announced later tonight, will decide the makeup of the countrys parliament for the next four years. Source: BBC -Agencies",

        "content": "Nineteen Indian fishermen detained by the Sri Lanka Navy were on Tuesday repatriated to India, the Indian High Commission said, almost a week after a similar number of fishermen were sent back to their home country. 19 Indian fishermen have been repatriated from Sri Lanka and are currently on their way to Chennai, the Indian High Commission here said in a post on X. The Navy has so far held 23 Indian trawlers and 178 Indian fishermen for allegedly fishing in the island nations waters thus far in 2024, and handed them over to authorities for legal action, the Sri Lankan Navy late last month confirmed in a statement. The fishermen issue is a contentious one in the ties between India and Sri Lanka, with Lankan Navy personnel even firing at Indian fishermen in the Palk Strait and seizing their boats in several alleged incidents of illegally entering Sri Lankan territorial waters. On April 3, 19 Indian fishermen detained by the Sri Lanka Navy were repatriated to India after being released by authorities here. The release of the 38 Indian fishermen comes amidst a row over the Katchatheevu island issue after the ruling BJP blamed the Congress Party for ceding the tiny island to Sri Lanka in 1974. The Palk Strait, a narrow strip of water separating Tamil Nadu from Sri Lanka, is a rich fishing ground for fishermen from both countries. Fishermen from both countries are arrested frequently for inadvertently trespassing into each others waters. In 2023, the island nations Navy arrested 240 Indian fishermen along with 35 trawlers for allegedly poaching in Sri Lankan waters. Source: NDTV",

        "date": "April 11, 2024 08:01 am",
        "content": "Israeli aircraft killed three sons of Hamas top political leader in the Gaza Strip on Wednesday, striking high-stakes targets at a time when Israel is holding delicate ceasefire negotiations with the terrorist group. Hamas said four of the leaders grandchildren were also killed. Ismail Haniyehs sons are among the highest-profile figures to be killed in the war so far. Israel said they were Hamas operatives, and Haniyeh accused Israel of acting in the spirit of revenge and murder. The deaths threaten to strain the internationally mediated ceasefire talks, which appeared to gain steam in recent days even as the sides remain far apart on key issues. Haniyeh said Hamas would not cave to the pressure leveled by the strike on his family. Hamas Al-Aqsa TV station said Hazem, Ameer and Mohammed Haniyeh were killed in the strike near the Shati refugee camp in Gaza City, where Ismail Haniyeh is originally from. Hamas said three of Haniyehs granddaughters and a grandson were also killed. Hamas did not disclose their ages. The brothers were traveling with family members in a single vehicle targeted by an Israeli drone, Al-Aqsa TV said. The Israeli military said Mohammed and Hazem were Hamas military operatives and that Ameer was a cell commander. It said they had conducted terrorist activity in the central Gaza Strip, without elaborating. It did not comment about the grandchildren killed. For Palestinians, the strike on Haniyehs family darkened an already grim Eid al-Fitr holiday, which ends the holy fasting month of Ramadan. Palestinians marked the holiday by visiting the graves of loved ones killed in the war. In the Jabaliya refugee camp near Gaza City, people sat quietly by graves surrounded by buildings destroyed by Israels offensive, which was launched in response to the deadly Hamas attack on Oct. 7. As misery in Gaza lingers, Israel has faced increasing pressure, including from its top ally, the U.S., to change tack in the war, especially in regards to the delivery of humanitarian aid. On Tuesday, President Biden called Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahus handling of the war in Gaza a mistake and urged his government to flood the beleaguered territory with aid. He repeated that call again Wednesday, saying the efforts to boost aid were not enough and demanding another entry point for trucks in northern Gaza. After months of supporting the war against Hamas, the White House has ramped up pressure on Israel to reach a ceasefire and taken a sterner line that has rattled the countries decades-old alliance and deepened Israels international isolation over the war. The most serious disagreement has been over Israels plans for an offensive in Rafah. The rift was worsened by an Israeli airstrike last week on an aid convoy that killed seven workers with the World Central Kitchen charity, most of them foreigners. Israel said the deaths were unintentional, but Biden was outraged. Bidens latest comments highlight the differences between Israel and the U.S. over humanitarian aid to people in Gaza, where the war has led to warnings of imminent famine for more than a million people. Israel halted aid deliveries to Gaza in the early days of the war, but under U.S. pressure has slowly increased the number of trucks allowed to enter the territory. Still, aid groups say supplies are not reaching desperate people quickly enough, blaming Israeli restrictions and noting that thousands of trucks are waiting to enter Gaza. The war has ignited a humanitarian catastrophe. Most of the territorys population has been displaced, and with vast swaths of Gazas urban landscape leveled in the fighting, many areas are uninhabitable. Source: AP --Agencies",

        "title": "South Korea opposition secures landslide victory in parliamentary vote",
        "date": "April 11, 2024 09:51 am",
        "content": "South Koreas liberal opposition parties scored a landslide victory in a parliamentary election held on Wednesday, dealing a resounding blow to President Yoon Suk Yeol and his conservative party but likely falling just short of a super majority. The Democratic Party (DP) was projected to take 175 of the 300 seats in the new assembly, data from the National Election Commission and network broadcasters showed with all votes counted as of 10:32 a.m. (0132 GMT). A splinter liberal party considered allied with the DP was expected to take 12 seats, projections showed, leaving the bloc short of the 200 seats needed for a super-majority. Yoons People Power Party (PPP) was set to win 108 seats. An official announcement of the results is due later on Thursday. DP leader Lee Jae-myung, who led a combative campaign against Yoon, said the top priority now was to work for an economic recovery that is palpable for the average consumer. The ruling and opposition parties must join forces to overcome the crisis in consumers economic livelihood, he said. The bitterly fought race was seen by some analysts as a referendum on Yoon, whose popularity has suffered amid a cost-of-living crisis and a spate of political scandals. Yoon, who took office in May 2022, was not up for election this time but his ability to pass legislation is likely to be further inhibited by the PPPs poor showing. He has suffered low ratings for months, hamstrung in implementing his pledges to cut taxes, ease business regulations and expand family support in the worlds fastest ageing society. Opposition control of parliament will continue a government stalemate in areas where Yoon has clashed with the liberals on policies that require legislation, such as tax incentives for businesses and whether to tax capital gains on stocks, analysts said. Yoon had humbly accepted the result of the election and pledged to renew his administration, his chief of staff said. Prime Minister Han Duck-soo and other senior aides had also offered to resign after the election defeat, Yonhap news reported. Political science professor Lee Jun-han of Incheon National University said the poll had all the characteristics of a midterm election, with voters delivering a message that the governments economic policies were failing. With the opposition with nearly 190 seats or more, I think the difficulties with legislation, budget, and state administration will continue in the future, he said. Analyst Kim Young-hwan of NH Investment  Securities said expectations were inevitably weaker for implementing Yoons push to enhance the value of corporate stocks considered to be trading at a discount compared to global peers. In early trading on Thursday, some stocks that had rallied on optimism around the governments so-called Corporate Value-up Programme, such as financials and automakers, fell on expectations the DP will likely block any tax cuts for corporations and wealthy investors. JUDGEMENT, RETURN OF FOES AND LAME DUCK Judgement was the common theme running through comments by opposition victors, many of whom had campaigned heavily focused on what they said was Yoons mismanagement of the economy and his refusal to acknowledge his wife acted improperly when she accepted a Dior bag as gift. First lady Kim Keon Hee has not been seen in public since Dec. 15 and was absent when Yoon voted, reflecting the view by some analysts and opposition party members that she had become a political liability for the president and his PPP. The election also brought the return of some of Yoons foes, including former Justice Minister Cho Kuk leading a splinter third party, former PPP leader Lee Jun-seok who had split with Yoon in a feud, and Choo Mi-ae, who as former justice minister clashed with Yoon when he was the top prosecutor. Yoon is, however, likely to avoid the super-majority of a two-third opposition control that could break presidential vetoes and pass constitutional amendments. But nearing the end of the first two years of his five-year single term allowed by the constitution, Yoon was likely to slip into a lame duck status, some analysts said. Mason Richey, a professor at Hankuk University of Foreign Studies, said Yoon might focus more on his overseas agenda now, though those plans could also be at risk if the opposition seeks to cut budgets. Given his likely lame duck status, the temptation for Yoon will be to focus on foreign policy where he will still have statutory power, Richey said. Source: Reuters -Agencies",

        "title": "Amnesty urges accountability for unlawful use of weapons in policing of protests in SL",
        "date": "April 11, 2024 10:59 am",
        "content": "Sri Lankas law enforcement officials who engaged in the violent repression of protests must be held accountable for committing widespread human rights violations, Amnesty International said in a new investigative report released on Wednesday (10). According to the rights group, the report, Ready to suppress any protest in Sri Lanka: Unlawful use of weapons during protests, has analysed the use of force during policing of 30 protests that took place in Sri Lanka between March 2022 and June 2023. Amnesty International said its research showed a pattern in the unlawful use of tear gas and water cannon and the misuse of batons by Sri Lankan law enforcement officials with video evidence revealing that in at least 17 protests  more than half of those analysed  the conduct of law enforcement officials fell well short of international law and standards on the use of force. From the outset, the Sri Lankas police approached the 2022-23 protests assuming that they would be unlawful and violent and that they would need to use force to repress them. The police failed to recognize that people have the right to peacefully protest, and that the authorities have a duty to facilitate and protect protests. Instead, they targeted, chased, and beat largely peaceful protesters, said Smriti Singh, Amnesty Internationals Regional Director for South Asia. During 2022 and 2023, Sri Lankans called for accountability for the prolonged economic crisis, corruption and human rights violations, in large-scale protests and an occupy movement known as the Aragalaya in Colombo and other cities across Sri Lanka. Amnesty International said it has documented unlawful use of force against largely peaceful protests that continue to date, including in 2024. Further, Amnesty International went on to allege that in the Northern and Eastern provinces of Sri Lanka, the security forces and intelligence agencies regularly carry out surveillance, intimidation, harassment, and obstruction of largely peaceful protests that have continued to take place since 2017 by the relatives of people forcibly disappeared during the internal armed conflict in Sri Lanka. During its investigation, the rights group has conducted 39 qualitative interviews and an open-source investigation into 95 verified videos gathered on social media of 30 protests, predominantly from Colombo, Battaramulla, Kelaniya, Jaffna and Galle. In March 2024, Amnesty International wrote to the Sri Lanka Police outlining the allegations in this report and requesting an official response but had not received a reply at the time of publication. The organization accuses the Sri Lankan police of following a pattern of using large quantities of tear gas against peaceful or largely peaceful protesters repeatedly in the same area without giving them an adequate opportunity to disperse, and without making any reasonable effort to limit risk of injury. Amnesty International emphasized that the videos it has verified also showed the combined use of water cannon and tear gas by police against largely peaceful protestors in 2023 in Sri Lanka without giving them sufficient time and opportunity to disperse, in breach of international law and standards as well as best practices. This was reportedly documented in various protests and most prominently on the peaceful protest of 3 February 2023 in Colombo. The statement published by Amnesty International also deplored the Sri Lankan police of firing tear gas grenades from behind the protesters while the protesters were trying to disperse, which it said was a breach of international human rights standards. They also repeatedly failed to take adequate precautionary measures when using tear gas, and fired into areas that had no clear exit such as near schools and on the street. This unnecessarily exposed children and bystanders to the effects of chemical irritants. Amnesty International analysed at least three videos which showed children rubbing their eyes, coughing, and experiencing discomfort. It also raised concerns about the failure to prosecute or convict any police officer or member of the army for the unlawful use of force during protests in Sri Lanka in 2022 and 2023 despite widespread human rights violations by law enforcement agencies and security forces. This lack of accountability exists within the context of a wider culture of impunity, where police and military personnel have rarely been held accountable for human rights violations; it also emboldens law enforcement officials to continue violently suppressing protests. Amnesty International further highlighted that the Sri Lankan state is responsible under international law to investigate effectively, impartially, and in a timely manner, any allegation or reasonable suspicion of human rights violations by law enforcement officials. If the investigations into the protests in Sri Lanka find sufficient credible evidence, those suspected of criminal responsibility must be brought to justice in fair trials before ordinary civilian courts. This applies to those with responsibility at all levels, including senior officers. Commenting further, Smriti Singh said: The brute force approach to policing of protests in Sri Lanka does not comply with international law and standards and restricts the right to freedom of peaceful assembly in the country which is guaranteed under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), to which Sri Lanka is a state party. The authorities must therefore urgently investigate all credible allegations of unlawful use of force by police during the 2022-23 protests in Sri Lanka, as a failure to do so would in itself be a violation of human rights.",

        "date": "April 11, 2024 12:16 pm",
        "content": "The Asian Development Bank (ADB) says its annual flagship economic publication  the Asian Development Outlook (ADO) April 2024  has projected Sri Lankas economy to record moderate growth of 1.9 in 2024 and 2.5 in 2025 following two consecutive years of contractions. According to the publication, Sri Lanka is showing signs of recovery, with green shoots emerging in the second half of 2023. Inflation has decelerated to single digits, foreign exchange reserves continue to be built up, and the exchange rate has appreciated. Meanwhile, tourist arrivals and remittance inflows continue to show a commendable recovery while supply conditions have improved. ADBs growth forecast hinges on the continuation of reforms and better consumer and business sentiment. Timely completion of external debt restructuring will also support Sri Lankas debt sustainability efforts, the regional development bank underscored. Sri Lanka has made commendable progress in implementing difficult policy reforms and stabilizing the economy in 2023, said ADB Deputy Country Director for Sri Lanka Utsav Kumar. We are pleased to see the results of these reforms, with signs of recovery emerging. It is critical that Sri Lanka addresses the impact on the poor and vulnerable and also continues to implement reforms to address the underlying causes of the crisis and lay the foundation for fostering sustainable recovery, building resilience, and reviving growth. The ADB went on to note that addressing poverty vulnerabilities amid economic recovery is a major challenge faced by the country, adding that poverty gains eroded as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent economic crisis. It pointed out that as the economy stabilizes, the island nation must ensure that the most affected and vulnerable groups of people are supported, and high poverty incidence and income inequality are addressed. This calls for appropriate institutional and structural frameworks for an inclusive social protection system with improved targeting. Creating jobs and fostering sustainable livelihoods would go a long way toward alleviating poverty. Further, the ADB asserted that it remains committed to achieving a prosperous, inclusive, resilient, and sustainable Asia and the Pacific, while sustaining its efforts to eradicate extreme poverty. Established in 1966, it is owned by 68 members49 from the region.",

        "title": "Vietnamese tycoon accused in multi-billion dollar bank fraud faces possible death sentence",
        "date": "April 11, 2024 01:48 pm",
        "content": "(BBC)  It is the most spectacular trial ever held in Vietnam, befitting one of the greatest bank frauds the world has ever seen. Behind the stately yellow portico of the colonial-era courthouse in Ho Chi Minh City, a 67-year-old property developer stands accused of looting one of Vietnams largest banks over a period of 11 years. The numbers involved are dizzying. Truong My Lan is charged with taking out 44bn (35bn) in loans from the Saigon Commercial Bank. Prosecutors say 27bn may never be recovered. The habitually secretive communist authorities have been uncharacteristically forthright about this case, going into minute detail for the media. They say they have summoned 2,700 people to testify. There are 10 state prosecutors and around 200 lawyers involved. The evidence is in 104 boxes weighing a total of six tonnes. Eighty-five defendants are on trial with Truong My Lan, who denies the charges. She and 13 others face a possible death sentence. There has never been a show trial like this, I think, in the communist era, says David Brown, a retired US state department official with long experience in Vietnam. There has certainly been nothing on this scale. The trial is the most dramatic chapter so far in the Blazing Furnaces anti-corruption campaign led by the Communist Party Secretary-General, Nguyen Phu Trong. A conservative ideologue steeped in Marxist theory, Nguyen Phu Trong believes that popular anger over untamed corruption poses an existential threat to the Communist Partys monopoly on power. He began the campaign in earnest in 2016 after out-manoeuvring the then pro-business prime minister to retain the top job in the party. The campaign has seen two presidents and two deputy prime ministers forced to resign, and hundreds of officials disciplined or jailed. Now one of the countrys richest women could join their ranks. Truong My Lan comes from a Sino-Vietnamese family in Ho Chi Minh City, formerly Saigon. It has long been the commercial engine of the Vietnamese economy, dating well back to its days as the anti-communist capital of South Vietnam, with a large, ethnic Chinese community. She started as a market stall vendor, selling cosmetics with her mother, but began buying land and property after the Communist Party ushered in a period of economic reform, known as Doi Moi, in 1986. By the 1990s, she owned a large portfolio of hotels and restaurants. Although Vietnam is best known outside the country for its fast-growing manufacturing sector, as an alternative supply chain to China, most wealthy Vietnamese made their money developing and speculating in property. All land is officially state-owned. Getting access to it often relies on personal relationships with state officials. Corruption escalated as the economy grew, and became endemic. By 2011, Truong My Lan was a well-known business figure in Ho Chi Minh City, and she was allowed to arrange the merger of three smaller, cash-strapped banks into a larger entity: Saigon Commercial Bank. Vietnamese law prohibits any individual from holding more than 5 of the shares in any bank. But prosecutors say that through hundreds of shell companies and people acting as her proxies, Truong My Lan actually owned more than 90 of Saigon Commercial. They accuse her of using that power to appoint her own people as managers, and then ordering them to approve hundreds of loans to the network of shell companies she controlled. The amounts taken out are staggering. Her loans made up 93 of all the banks lending. According to prosecutors, over a period of three years from February 2019, she ordered her driver to withdraw 108 trillion Vietnamese dong, more than 4bn (2.3bn) in cash from the bank, and store it in her basement. That much cash, even if all of it was in Vietnams largest denomination banknotes, would weigh two tonnes. She is also accused of bribing generously to ensure her loans were never scrutinised. One of those charged alongside her is a former chief inspector at the central bank, who faces a life sentence for accepting a 5m bribe. The mass of officially sanctioned publicity about the case has channelled public anger over corruption against Truong My Lan, whose haggard, unmade-up appearance in court has been in stark contrast to the glamorous publicity photos people have seen of her in the past. But questions are also being asked about why she was able to keep on with the alleged fraud for so long. I am puzzled, says Le Hong Hiep who runs the Vietnam Studies Programme at the ISEAS - Yusof Ishak Institute in Singapore. Because it wasnt a secret. It was well known in the market that Truong My Lan and her Van Thinh Phat group were using SCB as their own piggy bank to fund the mass acquisition of real estate in the most prime locations. It was obvious that she had to get the money from somewhere. But then it is such a common practice. SCB is not the only bank that is used like this. So perhaps the government lost sight because there are so many similar cases in the market. David Brown believes she was protected by powerful figures who have dominated business and politics in Ho Chi Minh City for decades. And he sees a bigger factor in play in the way this trial is being run: a bid to reassert the authority of the Communist Party over the free-wheeling business culture of the south. What Nguyen Phu Trong and his allies in the party are trying to do is to regain control of Saigon, or at least stop it from slipping away. Up until 2016 the party in Hanoi pretty much let this Sino-Vietnamese mafia run the place. They would make all the right noises that local communist leaders are supposed to make, but at the same time they were milking the city for a substantial cut of the money that was being made down there. At 79 years old, party chief Nguyen Phu Trong is in shaky health, and will almost certainly have to retire at the next Communist Party Congress in 2026, when new leaders will be chosen. He has been one of the longest-serving and most consequential secretary-generals, restoring the authority of the partys conservative wing to a level not seen since the reforms of the 1980s. He clearly does not want to risk permitting enough openness to undermine the partys hold on political power. But he is trapped in a contradiction. Under his leadership the party has set an ambitious goal of reaching rich country status by 2045, with a technology and knowledge-based economy. This is what is driving the ever-closer partnership with the United States. Yet faster growth in Vietnam almost inevitably means more corruption. Fight corruption too much, and you risk extinguishing a lot of economic activity. Already there are complaints that bureaucracy has slowed down, as officials shy away from decisions which might implicate them in a corruption case. Thats the paradox, says Le Hong Hiep. Their growth model has been reliant on corrupt practices for so long. Corruption has been the grease that that kept the machinery working. If they stop the grease, things may not work any more.

        "date": "April 11, 2024 02:24 pm",
        "content": "The Government of Japan has provided a grant of USD 8.4 million through the International Organization for Migration (IOM) to strengthen PoE facilities in Sri Lanka and the Maldives. The grant component for Sri Lanka aims to strengthen capacities at the Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) and the Colombo Port which are vital gateways to the island nation, to be future-ready for responding to any public health emergencies such as pandemics and infectious diseases. The event for handing over the first part of the donation took place on Wednesday (10) at the BIA. Under this initiative, BIA and Colombo Port are set to receive cutting-edge equipment and facilities, including advanced baggage scanners, full body scanners, Automated Border Control (ABC) gates equipped with a Face Recognition System (AFRS), full-page e-passport scanners, and biometric-based access control systems. Additionally, the project renovates approximately 150 washrooms at BIA with sensor-operated, touchless equipment providing hygienic benefits for passengers, crew, and staff. At the event, the Ambassador of Japan to Sri Lanka, Mizukoshi Hideaki stated: I am proud to reaffirm Japans unwavering commitment to the recovery, growth, and development of Sri Lanka. Our support extends particularly to the enhancement of PoE, with a special focus on BIA and Colombo Port. Through this initiative, Japan aims to fortify PoE capabilities, ensuring seamless management of future emergencies, especially during pandemics. In addition, the project will provide much-needed medical equipment, and renovate and equip the isolation room at BIA in line with International Health Regulations (IHR), alongside enhancements to both BIA and Colombo Port waste disposal capabilities. A four-story office building will be constructed for the Port Health Service at Colombo Port and 25 Sri Lankan Diplomatic Missions will receive biometric enrollment workstations enabling linking up with the Department of Immigration and Emigration to speed up passport issuance for Sri Lankans living overseas. For a greater outcome, the project will provide comprehensive training and staff capacity building to strengthen border health compliance in line with international standards enabling swift response to public health emergencies. Commenting on the timely initiative, Minister of Ports, Shipping and Aviation, Nimal Siripala De Silva, at the ceremony stated: I am immensely grateful for the generous financial support given by the Government of Japan and IOM Sri Lanka for this important initiative which will significantly bolster health preparedness at Sri Lankas main Airport and the Colombo Port, in consonance with International Health Regulations, and in turn garner public confidence for uninterrupted, safe, and secure cross-border operations benefitting passengers, crew, and staff. This project is implemented by IOM under the guidance of the Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Aviation in close coordination with the Airport  Aviation Services Sri Lanka Limited (AASL), Sri Lanka Ports Authority, the Department of Immigration and Emigration, and the Ministries of Health and Foreign Affairs. Commenting on the occasion, the Chief of Mission of the International Organization for Migration for Sri Lanka  the Maldives, Mr. Sarat Dash stated that IOM strongly believes that strengthening the PoE is an investment for the future. The focus of the project extends beyond physical infrastructure and encompasses efforts for the economy, security, and digital landscape. IOM feels privileged to be a part of this project of national significance and is grateful for the support extended by all stakeholders for its successful implementation. The project intervention will reduce physical contact points, waiting time and congestion at points of entry for efficient, secure, and safe operations at BIA and Colombo Port. It will further improve traveller confidence, driving the potential for a boost in tourism and business travel offering an opportunity for mobility to return to pre-pandemic levels and adapt to the post-pandemic reality.",

Two police officers attached to Medawachchiya Police Station have been arrested by the Kebithigollewa Crimes Unit over the alleged assault on a youth on April 07 in Medawachchiya. Accordingly, a Police Sergeant and a Constable attached to Medawachchiya Police have been arrested for allegedly inhumanely assaulting the youth after taking the latter into custody. They are to be produced before the Kebithigollewa Magistrates Court later today (11), police said. According to the Police Media Division, in the evening of April 07, a group of police officers on traffic duty near the Medawachchiya primary school on the Mannar-Medawachchiya road had signalled a small lorry heading towards Mannar to stop. However, the lorry driver had ignored the police directive to stop the vehicle and continued forward prompting the police officers to give chase. While the lorry was evading the police and proceeding through byroads another team of police officers from the same station who were travelling in a three-wheeler for an operation in the area had noticed this lorry fleeing. These officers had also chased after the lorry and managed to intercept the vehicle on a byroad. But as the officers were preparing to search the vehicle they had started it sped away once again. The police officer had finally succeeded in stopping the small lorry in the Thulaveliya area after continuing to give chase. Prior to their arrest, the lorry drivers assistant had attempted to throw away a plastic bottle containing 05 litres of illicit liquor. The drivers assistant, 20, was arrested with the said illicit liquor while the lorry driver, 23, was arrested on charges of driving under the influence, driving without a valid license, ignoring police orders and dangerous driving. Both are residents of Thulaveliya in Medawachchiya. While the arrested suspects were in police custody, the lorry driver had complained of severe abdominal pain and was subsequently admitted to the Medawachchiya Hospital and later transferred to Anuradhapura Hospital. The suspect has informed Anuradhapura Hospital Police that the officers of the Medawachchiya Police Station had repeatedly assaulted him during the arrest. The Kebithigollewa Division Crimes Unit had launched an investigation into the complaint and arrested the two police officers in question over the said incident, police said.",

Commenting in this regard, the Ambassador of Sri Lanka to Thailand, Mr. Janaka Bandara said the rescued people will be repatriated to the island in the coming days. Out of the 56 Sri Lankans who were trapped in cybercrime camps in Myawaddy, eight were rescued by the Myanmar government authorities in early March and sent to the Myawaddy central police station. This morning (11), Burmese immigration officials handed the group over to the Thai officials across the ThaiMyanmar Friendship Bridge. According to Ambassador Bandara, the rescued Sri Lankans are in good health and are currently accommodated at the Sri Lankan embassy in Thailand. In December 2023, media reports shed light on the plight of a group of nearly 60 Sri Lankans, who were lured with tourist visas behind the false front of lucrative IT sector job offers and are being held captive in Myanmar by a notorious ethnic armed group. It was understood that they had been duped into applying to job vacancies in Dubai by a certain agent in UAE, only to be trafficked into Myanmar for cyber slavery in Myawaddy where they were forced to commit internet scams. According to harrowing statements given by the captives, they had been forced to appear as romantic partners to foreigners in order to steal their money. In the event they refuse to do as told, the captives had been subjected to acts of torture, which they said included electrocution, waterboarding in cages, hanging them by their hands and starving.",

        "date": "April 11, 2024 07:57 pm",
        "content": "At least 17 Pakistani pilgrims have died in a bus crash while travelling to a shrine in Balochistan for Eid-al-Fitr celebrations. The accident occurred late on Wednesday officials say, when the vehicle lost control before falling into a ravine. More than 40 are also being treated for injuries in Karachi and police have warned casualties could rise. High-fatality crashes are common in Pakistan, often caused by driver error and poorly maintained roads. Balochistan Chief Minister Sindh Murad Ali Shah told reporters that two children were among the injured, and that at least five people had sustained serious head injuries. They were all very poor people, he said of the victims, describing them as labourers who had been travelling by truck from the Thatta region in the countrys south, to visit a Sufi Muslim temple in the remote city of Khuzdar some 500km (310 miles) away. He added that the details of the accident were still under investigation. Balochistans deputy commissioner, Munir Ahmad Kakar, told the BBC that there were some 60 people, including men, women and children riding in the truck when the accident occurred and that it may have been due to a brake fail. Eid al-Fitr - which means festival of the breaking of the fast - is celebrated by millions of Muslims around the world, including those in Pakistan. It marks the end of Ramadan, a month of fasting, spiritual reflection and prayer. Source: BBC -Agencies",

        "date": "April 11, 2024 11:21 pm",
        "content": "Real estate tycoon Truong My Lan was sentenced Thursday to death by a court in Ho Chi Minh City in southern Vietnam in the countrys largest financial fraud case ever, state media Vietnam Net said. The 67-year-old chair of the real estate company Van Thinh Phat was formally charged with fraud amounting to 12.5 billion  nearly 3 of the countrys 2022 GDP. Lan illegally controlled Saigon Joint Stock Commercial Bank between 2012 and 2022 and allowed 2,500 loans that resulted in losses of 27 billion to the bank, reported state media VnExpress. The court asked her to compensate the bank 26.9 million. Despite mitigating circumstances  this was a first-time offense and Lan participated in charity activities  the court attributed its harsh sentence to the seriousness of the case, saying Lan was at the helm of an orchestrated and sophisticated criminal enterprise that had serious consequences with no possibility of the money being recovered, VnExpress said. Her actions not only violate the property management rights of individuals and organizations but also push SCB (Saigon Joint Stock Commercial Bank) into a state of special control; eroding peoples trust in the leadership of the Party and State, VnExpress quoted the judgement as saying. Her niece, Truong Hue Van, the chief executive of Van Thinh Phat, was sentenced to 17 years in prison for aiding her aunt. Lan and her family established the Van Thing Phat company in 1992 after Vietnam shed its state-run economy in favor of a more market-oriented approach that was open to foreigners. She had started out helping her mother, a Chinese businesswoman, to sell cosmetics in Ho Chi Minh Citys oldest market, according to state media Tien Phong. Van Thinh Phat would grow to become one of Vietnams richest real estate firms, with projects including luxury residential buildings, offices, hotels and shopping centers. This made her a key player in the countrys financial industry. She orchestrated the 2011 merger of the beleaguered SCB bank with two other lenders in coordination with Vietnams central bank. The court found that she used this approach to tap SCB for cash. She indirectly owned more than 90 of the bank  a charge she denied  and approved thousands of loans to ghost companies, according to government documents. These loans then found their way back to her, state media VNExpress reported, citing the courts findings. She then bribed officials to cover her tracks, it added. Former central bank official Do Thi Nhan was also sentenced Thursday to life in prison for accepting 5.2 million in bribes. Lans arrest in October 2022 was among the most high-profile in an ongoing anti-corruption drive in Vietnam that has intensified since 2022. The so-called Blazing Furnace campaign has touched the highest echelons of Vietnamese politics. Former President Vo Van Thuong resigned in March after being implicated in the campaign. But Lans trial shocked the nation. Analysts said the scale of the scam raised questions about whether other banks or businesses had similarly erred, dampening Vietnams economic outlook and making foreign investors jittery at a time when Vietnam has been trying to position itself as the ideal home for businesses trying to pivot their supply chains away from China. The real estate sector in Vietnam has been hit particularly hard. An estimated 1,300 property firms withdrew from the market in 2023, developers have been offering discounts and gold as gifts to attract buyers, and despite rents for mixed-use properties known in Southeast Asia as shophouses falling by a third in Ho Chi Minh City, many in the city center are still empty, according to state media. In November, Communist Party General Secretary Nguyen Phu Trong, Vietnams top politician, said that the anti-corruption fight would continue for the long term. Source: Associated Press -Agencies",

        "date": "April 12, 2024 12:50 pm",
        "content": "Indias former Union Minister Yashwant Sinha said the BJP (Bharatiya Janata Party) has made the Katchatheevu island an election issue ahead of Lok Sabha polls without thinking of its implications on the India-Sri Lanka relations. The decades-old territorial and fishing rights dispute around the Katchatheevu island is in the limelight again with the BJP and the opposition parties engaged in a war of words. Sinha, who had served as Indias finance minister, and external affairs minister, said the island falls on the Sri Lankan side of the maritime boundary. I am extremely dismayed that no other than the prime minister of the country has raised this issue. I am aware of the fact that Katchatheevu was an island which when the maritime, international maritime line was drawn fell on the side of Sri Lanka and therefore went to Sri Lanka. And that is why repeatedly the Ministry of External Affairs has held the position that there was no question of conceding any territory to Sri Lanka because the island fell on the Sri Lankan side, Sinha said. Therefore to raise this issue now, I can only say that it will spoil the relationship with Sri Lanka. And what will you do? Are you going to use force to take the island back? So this is nothing but an election issue, he said. The island is located between Rameswaram in India and Sri Lanka. In 1974, the then central government accepted Katchatheevu as Sri Lankan territory under the Indo-Sri Lankan Maritime Agreement. Now, in an election, you raise many issues. But you have to be conscious of the implications of the issues that you raise. Here, the prime minister has raised the issue without at all looking at the implications it is going to have on our bilateral relationship with Sri Lanka, he said. Modi had targeted the Congress as well as the DMK over the ceding of the islet in 1974 by the then-party-led government. He had cited a media report to assert that new facts revealed that the Congress callously gave away Katchatheevu to Sri Lanka. Commenting on the situation at Indias northern borders, Sinha accused the government of misleading people and quoted a written reply given in Parliament saying China has occupied 38,000 square km of Indian territory in the Union Territory of Ladakh. I am not concerned with what China claims, I am concerned with the fact that according to a reply given by the Defence Minister, 38,000 square km of our land has been taken over by China. Thats a Parliament question and you cant, you know, not say the right thing in reply to a Parliament question. Now, the Home Minister of India says not an inch of our territory has been taken by China. He is absolutely wrong. And he is misleading the people of India because his own colleague, the defence minister, has said that China has occupied 38,000 square km of our land, he said. In a written reply to a question in Lok Sabha in February 2022, Minister of State for External Affairs V Muraleedharan said China continues to be in illegal occupation of approximately 38,000 sq km of Indian territory in the Union Territory of Ladakh for the last six decades. Asked about Jammu and Kashmir, he said Article 370 is dead and gone. If you are referring to the abolition of Article 370, I would say that Article 370 was already dead and gone. It was just a hollow shell. There was nothing left in Article 370. What the government of the day did was, it declared it dead and buried it, he said. The former finance minister also raised red flags over statistics being put out by the Union government, and said, I dont trust the statistics put out by this government. Sinha said during his tenure as the finance minister, there was a strong system of compiling and disseminating statistics. In my time, I strengthened that system. I made the National Statistical Commission (NSC) an independent body, but it is not so anymore. I am sorry to say that the Statistical Commission has also been brought within the ambit of the government, and it has lost its independence. So, it is dishing out figures or concealing figures as the government wants, he said. People in the government and prime ministers are talking about all the progress that has been made. Did you know that in the 10 years of the UPA government and the 10 years of the Modi government, the amount of loan that the government of India has taken has just doubled? The amount of money which is being borrowed by this government is huge, and therefore, they have to take huge amounts of loan, and their fiscal deficit is not what it should have been, Sinha added. Sinha, a former IAS officer who resigned in 1984 to join politics, was with the BJP till 2018, when he quit alleging that the NDA government at the Centre was undermining democratic institutions. The former Hazaribagh MP joined the Trinamool Congress in 2021. Source: PTI -Agencies",

        "date": "April 12, 2024 01:47 pm",
        "content": "U.S. President Joe Biden said Thursday that U.S. defense commitment to Pacific allies was ironclad as he gathered Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida at the White House in the midst of growing concern about provocative Chinese military action in the Indo-Pacific. The U.S. and the Philippines have had a mutual treaty in place for more than 70 years. Bidens forceful reinforcement of the American commitment comes in the midst of persistent skirmishes between the Philippine and Chinese coast guards in the disputed South China Sea. The United States defense commitments to Japan and to the Philippines are ironclad. Theyre ironclad, Biden said as he began three-way talks at the White House with Kishida and Marcos. As I said before, any attack on Philippine aircraft, vessels or armed forces in the South China Sea would invoke our mutual defense treaty. Relations between China and the Philippines have been repeatedly tested by confrontations involving the two nations coast guard vessels in the disputed South China Sea. Chinese coast guard ships also regularly approach disputed Japanese-controlled East China Sea islands near Taiwan. The so-called gray-zone harassment by China has included shining military-grade lasers at the Philippine Coast Guard, firing water cannons at vessels and ramming into Philippine ships near the Second Thomas Shoal, which both Manila and Beijing claim. In 1999, Manila intentionally ran a World War IIera ship aground on the shoal, establishing a permanent military presence there. Biden, in a wide-ranging phone call with Chinese President Xi Jinping last week, raised concerns about Chinas operations in the South China Sea, including efforts to impede the Philippines from resupplying its forces on the Second Thomas Shoal. Chinese officials have bristled at criticism over their action in the South China Sea and blamed the U.S. for exacerbating tensions. No one should violate Chinas territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests, and China remains steadfast in safeguarding our lawful rights, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said Thursday. The White House billed the first-ever trilateral summit with Japan and the Philippines as a potent response to Chinas attempts at intimidation and said it would send a message that China is the outlier in the neighborhood, according to an administration official. The White House said in a statement that Biden and Marcos during the talks underscored their commitment to international law in the South China Sea and reaffirmed their countries treaty obligations to defend each other. The leaders also announced joint patrols in the Indo-Pacific this year, a follow-up on law enforcement drills carried out last year by the allies in waters near the South China Sea. The U.S. Coast Guard will welcome Philippine and Japanese coast guard members onto a U.S. Coast Guard vessel during the patrol for training, according to White House. The summit followed Bidens one-on-one talks and glitzy state dinner Wednesday at the White House for the Japanese premier, a diplomatic honor meant to recognize Tokyos growing clout on the global stage. White House officials said they were aiming to send a clear signal that the Democratic administration remains determined to build what it calls a latticework of alliances in the Indo-Pacific even as it grapples with the Israel-Hamas war and Russias ongoing invasion of Ukraine. Biden also hosted Marcos for a private meeting at the White House ahead of the three-way talks. Todays summit is an opportunity to define the future that we want, and how we intend to achieve it together, Marcos said. Biden also announced that the three nations were launching a a new economic corridor in the Philippines as part of the G7 Partnership for Global Infrastructure Investment that would help develop clean energy, port, agriculture and other projects in the country. Biden said the leaders were forging a new era and predicted a great deal of history in our world will be written in the Indo-Pacific in the coming years. The United States, the United Kingdom and Japan on Wednesday announced joint military exercises in the Indo-Pacific in 2025. That followed the Pentagon revealing earlier this week that the U.S., the U.K. and Australia were considering including Japan in the AUKUS partnership, a grouping launched in 2021 that aims to equip Australia with nuclear-powered and conventionally armed submarines. Kishida visited Capitol Hill on Thursday for an address to U.S. lawmakers that focused on the need to strengthen the partnership between the U.S. and Japan at a time of tension in the Asia-Pacific and skepticism in Congress about U.S. involvement abroad. He offered concern about the undercurrent of self-doubt among some Americans about what your role in the world should be. Biden has made improving relations with the Philippines a priority since Marcos became the countrys president in June 2022. The relationship has had ups and downs over the years and was in a difficult place when Marcos took office. Human rights groups said Marcos predecessor Rodrigo Dutertes war on drugs resulted in thousands of extrajudicial killings. Marcos, the son and namesake of the countrys former dictator, said as a candidate he would look to pursue closer ties with China. But he has increasingly drifted toward Washington amid concerns about Chinas coercive action. Biden hosted him for talks at the White House last year, the first Washington visit by a Philippine president in more than a decade. Biden also met him on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly soon after Marcos took office, and dispatched Vice President Kamala Harris to Manila in 2022 to meet him. Last year, the Philippines agreed to give the U.S. access to four more bases on the islands. Source: Associated Press -Agencies",

        "date": "April 12, 2024 05:01 pm",
        "content": "O.J. Simpson, the American football star and actor who was sensationally acquitted in 1995 of murdering his former wife in what U.S. media dubbed the trial of the century, has died at the age of 76. His family said in a social media post on Thursday that he had died on Wednesday after a battle with cancer. Simpson was found not guilty in the 1994 stabbing deaths of former wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ronald Goldman in Los Angeles, although he was found responsible for her death in a civil lawsuit. Simpson later served nine years in a Nevada prison after being convicted in 2008 on 12 counts of armed robbery and kidnapping two sports memorabilia dealers at gunpoint in a Las Vegas hotel. Nicknamed The Juice, Simpson was one of the best and most popular athletes of the late 1960s and 1970s. He overcame childhood infirmity to become an electrifying running back at the University of Southern California and won the Heisman Trophy as college footballs top player. After a record-setting career in the NFL with the Buffalo Bills and San Francisco 49ers, he was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame. Simpson parlayed his football stardom into a career as a sportscaster, advertising pitchman and Hollywood actor in films including the Naked Gun series. All that changed after Nicole Brown Simpson and Goldman were found fatally slashed in a bloody scene outside her Los Angeles home on June 12, 1994. Simpson quickly emerged as a suspect. He was ordered to surrender to police but five days after the killings, he fled in his white Ford Bronco with a former teammate - carrying his passport and a disguise. A slow-speed chase through the Los Angeles area ended at Simpsons mansion and he was later charged in the murders. What ensued was one of the most notorious trials in 20th century America and a media circus. It had everything: a rich celebrity defendant; a Black man accused of killing his white former wife out of jealousy; a woman slain after divorcing a man who had beaten her; a dream team of pricy and charismatic defense lawyers; and a huge gaffe by prosecutors. Simpson, who at the outset of the case declared himself absolutely 100 percent not guilty, waved at the jurors and mouthed the words thank you after the predominately Black panel of 10 women and two men acquitted him on Oct. 3, 1995. Prosecutors argued that Simpson killed Nicole in a jealous fury, and they presented extensive blood, hair and fiber tests linking Simpson to the murders. The defense countered that the celebrity defendant was framed by racist white police. The trial transfixed America. In the White House, President Bill Clinton left the Oval Office and watched the verdict on his secretarys TV. Many Black Americans celebrated his acquittal, seeing Simpson as the victim of bigoted police. Many white Americans were appalled by his exoneration. Simpsons legal team included prominent criminal defense lawyers Johnnie Cochran, Alan Dershowitz and F. Lee Bailey, who often out-maneuvered the prosecution. Prosecutors committed a memorable blunder when they directed Simpson to try on a pair of blood-stained gloves found at the murder scene, confident they would fit perfectly and show he was the killer. In a highly theatrical demonstration, Simpson struggled to put on the gloves and indicated to the jury they did not fit. Delivering the trials most famous words, Cochran referred to the gloves in closing arguments to jurors with a rhyme: If it doesnt fit, you must acquit. Dershowitz later called the prosecution decision to ask Simpson to try on the gloves the greatest legal blunder of the 20th century. What this verdict tells you is how fame and money can buy the best defense, can take a case of overwhelming incriminating physical evidence and transform it into a case riddled with reasonable doubt, Peter Arenella, a UCLA law professor, told the New York Times after the verdict. A predominantly African-American jury was more susceptible to claims of police incompetence and corruption and more willing to impose a higher burden of proof than normally required for proof beyond a reasonable doubt, Arenella said. After his acquittal, Simpson said that I will pursue as my primary goal in life the killer or killers who slayed Nicole and Mr. Goldman... They are out there somewhere... I would not, could not and did not kill anyone. The Goldman and Brown families subsequently pursued a wrongful death lawsuit against Simpson in civil court. In 1997, a predominately white jury in Santa Monica, California, found Simpson liable for the two deaths and ordered him to pay 33.5 million in damages. We finally have justice for Ron and Nicole, Fred Goldman, Ron Goldmans father, said after the verdict. Simpsons dream team did not represent him in the civil trial in which the burden of proof was lower than in a criminal trial - a preponderance of the evidence rather than beyond a reasonable doubt. New evidence also hurt Simpson, including photographs of him wearing the type of shoes that had left bloody footprints at the murder scene. After the civil case, some of Simpsons belongings, including memorabilia from his football days, were taken and auctioned off to help pay the damages he owed. On Oct. 3, 2008, exactly 13 years after his acquittal in the murder trial, he was convicted by a Las Vegas jury on charges including kidnapping and armed robbery. These stemmed from a 2007 incident at a casino hotel in which Simpson and five men, at least two carrying guns, stole sports memorabilia worth thousands of dollars from two dealers. Simpson said he was just trying to recover his own property but was sentenced to up to 33 years in prison. I didnt want to hurt anybody, Simpson, donning a blue prison jumpsuit with shackles on his legs and wrists, said at his sentencing. I didnt know I was doing anything wrong. Simpson was released on parole in 2017 and moved into a gated community in Las Vegas. He was granted early release from parole in 2021 due to good behavior at age 74. His life saga was recounted in the Oscar-winning 2016 documentary O.J.: Made in America as well as various TV dramatizations. Orenthal James Simpson was born in San Francisco on July 9, 1947. He contracted rickets at age 2 and was forced to wear leg braces until he was 5 but recovered so thoroughly that he became one of the most celebrated football players of all time. During nine seasons for the Buffalo Bills and two for the San Francisco 49ers, Simpson became one of the greatest ball carriers in NFL history. In 1973, he became the first NFL player to rush for more than 2,000 yards in a season. He retired in 1979. Simpson also became an advertising pitchman, best known for years of TV commercials for Hertz rental cars. As an actor, he appeared in movies including The Towering Inferno (1974), Capricorn One (1977) and the The Naked Gun cop spoof films in 1988, 1991 and 1994, playing a witless police detective. Simpson married his first wife, Marguerite, in 1967 and they had three children, including one who drowned in the familys swimming pool at age 2 in 1979, the year the couple divorced. Simpson met future wife Nicole Brown when she was a 17-year-old waitress and he was still married to Marguerite. Simpson and Brown married in 1985 and had two children. She later called police after incidents in which he struck her. Simpson pleaded no contest to spousal abuse charges in 1989. Source: Reuters -Agencies",

        "date": "April 12, 2024 06:59 pm",
        "content": "India on Wednesday said it is and will remain Colombos most reliable friend and dependable partner as it underlined that New Delhi was willing to offer modern defence equipment to friendly partner countries like Sri Lanka. Addressing the Second India-Sri Lanka Defence Seminar here, Indias High Commissioner to Sri Lanka, Santosh Jha, said that like in other areas, India and Sri Lanka were cooperating closely on security and defence matters. Because of our geography, our security is interlinked and intertwined. And when we speak of security, we must remember that it has acquired a wider meaning than we have traditionally associated with it, Jha said and added, after the Covid19 pandemic and impact of Russia-Ukraine conflict, it has come to include energy, health, food and even economic security. The various advanced platforms and equipment developed indigenously in India can also become viable, affordable and modern solutions for the Sri Lankan military, he said. Our support in recent years to Sri Lanka, during the Covid pandemic and the economic crisis, was driven by our sense of responsibility and obligation for our closest friend and neighbour. We stood shoulder to shoulder with our civilisational twin when it was needed most and without any hesitation, he said, referring to the more than USD four billion in economic assistance extended to the country during its unprecedented economic turmoil. Many of you will agree that India is and will remain Sri Lankasmost reliable friend and a trusted and dependable partner, Jha said, adding, Our bilateral cooperation is expanding and diversifying. It is buttressed by Indias growing national capabilities. Sri Lankas State Minister of Defence Premitha Bandara Tennakoon, Chief of Defence Staff Gen Shavendra Silva and the Commanders of the Air Force and Navy apart from senior officials from the Sri Lankan Armed Forces were present on the occasion. He said that under the Atmanirbhar Bharat (self-reliant India) vision, India has developed significant capability development within the Indian defence industry. We have invested in research and development and promoted the use of innovation and new-age technologies to build capabilities that are future-ready, Jha said. The Indian defence industry today rolls out state-of-the-art systems, advanced technologies and world-class equipment, he said and named fighter aircraft, helicopters, naval vessels, electronic warfare systems, cyber security solutions, small arms and large calibre precision long-range artillery systems among others. Not only are we producing for our own national requirements, but we have been willing to make these capabilities available to our friendly partner countries like Sri Lanka, the High Commissioner said. Indias defence exports today stand at nearly USD 2.6 billion, a 10-fold increase over the past five years, he said, adding, We export defence hardware and software to more than 85 countries with more than 100 indigenous firms active in this field. Today, India can offer high quality, low cost, and reliable technology in defence with an assured supply chain for long-term maintenance support, Jha added. As in other sectors, our endeavour has been that our growing capabilities must also benefit our neighbours, including Sri Lanka. We are committed to supporting the needs and requirements of the Sri Lankan Armed Forces, he added. He also expressed confidence that the seminar, being held in Sri Lanka for the second time in the last two years, will focus on security and defence cooperation and help identify the shared priorities for the two nations. Jha said that the event, which would showcase the various advanced platforms and equipment, would enable the Sri Lankan armed forces to familiarise themselves with various capabilities that have been developed indigenously in India. We are confident that these can also become viable, affordable and modern solutions for the Sri Lankan military, he asserted. Earlier, he reminded the gathering of their shared civilisational past, common heritage and strong cultural connect that has created a natural warmth and comfort in dealing with each other. Jha also said, as close and proximate neighbours, cooperation is the only option but added that it is not driven by choice and opportunity alone. Our approach to Sri Lanka is guided by our neighbourhood-first policy and our SAGAR vision. This entails that we share with our closest neighbours all that we can based on their needs and aspirations. It also entails that our approach remains generous and non-reciprocal, he said. SAGAR or Security and Growth for All in the Region is a flagship government initiative to help Indian Ocean Region neighbours. Led by Anurag Bajpai, Additional Secretary, Department of Defence Production, Indias Ministry of Defence, a large and very diverse delegation from the Indian defence industry, including some leading Indian Defence Public Sector entities and a wide range of industry players from the private sector, too attended the seminar. Representatives from the Sri Lankan business too were in attendance. Source: PTI -Agencies",

        "date": "April 12, 2024 10:01 pm",
        "content": "The uncertainty over the impending elections in Sri Lanka will cause a possible downward trend in the countrys economic outlook, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) has said. The island nation is set to face a presidential election in the last quarter of this year, while the parliamentary election is due mid-next year. However, political uncertainty prevails in the country as opposition parties have pledged to reverse the current IMF-linked reforms, which have proved to be unpopular with the masses. President Ranil Wickremesinghe, who has steered the recovery programme by going into a bailout deal with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for a USD 2.9 billion facility, maintains that the island could once again face economic collapse if the IMF programme reforms are not adhered to. Outlining the economic risks Sri Lanka is facing, the ADB in its South Asian chapters economic trends report released yesterday said, Among them the most important is uncertainty associated with the upcoming elections, including any possible impact on fiscal policy and reform implementation. The ADB noted that there are signs of economic recovery in Lanka and emerging growth had revived in the second half of 2023 and is expected to continue in 2024 and 2025. Inflation decelerated in single digits last year following a peak in 2022 and will remain below 10 per cent in 2024 and 2025. Challenges remain and the upcoming electoral cycle must not delay the reforms required to address the recent economic crisis. Sri Lanka needs to address vulnerability to poverty to ensure inclusive growth, the report said. Its been two years since Sri Lanka declared its first-ever default of sovereign debt. The negotiations for debt restructuring continue. Delays in the completion of a debt restructuring agreement and any barriers to passing key legislation could dampen sentiment and derail growth, the report warned. The IMF in March said it had reached a staff-level agreement with Sri Lanka for the next phase that would enable it access to USD 337 million from the nearly USD 3 billion bailout approved in 2023 for the island nation. Two tranches of USD 330 million each were released in March and December 2023 even as the global lender praised Colombo for its macroeconomic policy reforms, which it said, are starting to bear fruit.

        "date": "April 12, 2024 10:44 pm",
        "content": "(AP)  Norways health minister resigned Friday, the second Norwegian government member to step down this year amid allegations they plagiarized academic works. Ingvild Kjerkol resigned a day after a probe by Nord University in Bodoe in northern Norway, where Kjerkol, handed in her master thesis in 2021, concluded that there is a not insignificant amount of plagiarism in her masters thesis. We have come to the conclusion that Ingvild should resign as minister, Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre told a press conference. He said the probe had concluded the plagiarism was intentional. Kjerkoll said she and a co-author did not intend to plagiarize other peoples assignments. Although it hurts not to be believed, we have to deal with the fact that (the university) is of a different opinion, she said at a joint press conference with Gahr Støre. The 48-year-old Kjerkol has been in office since October 2021 when Gahr Støre presented a coalition government of his own Labor party and the junior Center Party. Kjerkol is the second government member to be entangled in academic plagiarism allegations this year. In January, Sandra Borch stepped down as minister for research and higher education after a student discovered that parts of Borchs masters thesis, including spelling mistakes, were copied without attribution from a different author. Gahr Støres coalition has seen the departure of several ministers in recent months over other wrongdoings. In September, it was revealed that the husband of then Foreign Minister Anniken Huitfeldt had been trading in stocks for years behind her back and that could potentially enrich her. In September, the ruling social democratic Labor party was defeated in local elections by the conservative Hoeyre, the main opposition party, for the first time since 1924. The party, which for decades was Norways largest party in local elections, came in second in the Sept. 11 elections for local councils in Norways 356 municipalities and 11 counties.

        "date": "April 13, 2024 09:39 am",
        "content": "The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has selected Kristalina Georgieva to serve as its Managing Director for a second five-year term starting on October 1, 2024. IMFs Executive Board took the decision on Friday (12) by consensus. In a press release, the global lender said that in line with the selection process it had established on March 13, 2024, the Board has held several rounds of discussions, including with Georgieva, the sole candidate nominated for the position, before making its decision. Georgieva has served as IMFs Managing Director since October 1, 2019. The Managing Director is the chief of the IMFs operating staff and Chair of the Executive Board. The Managing Director is assisted by four Deputy Managing Directors in overseeing the Funds operations, which serve its membership through about 3,100 staff. The 70-year-old Bulgarian national has been the IMFs Managing Director since 2019. Previously she served as Chief Executive Officer of the World Bank from January 2017. From February 1, 2019, to April 8, 2019, she was the Interim President for the World Bank Group. She also served at the European Commission as Commissioner for International Cooperation, Humanitarian Aid and Crisis Response, and as Vice President for Budget and Human Resources. Georgieva has a Ph.D. in Economic Science and a M.A. in Political Economy and Sociology from the University of National and World Economy in Bulgaria, where she also taught from 1977 to 1991. Following the Executive Board meeting, its coordinators Afonso S. Bevilaqua and Abdullah F. BinZarah made the following statement: In taking this decision, the Board commended Ms. Georgievas strong and agile leadership during her term, navigating a series of major global shocks. Ms. Georgieva led the IMFs unprecedented response to these shocks, including the approval of more than 360 billion in new financing since the start of the pandemic for 97 countries, debt service relief to the Funds poorest, most vulnerable members, and a historic Special Drawing Rights (SDR) allocation equivalent to 650 billion. Under her leadership, the Fund introduced innovative new financing facilities, including the Resilience and Sustainability Facility and the Food Shock Window. It replenished the Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust, with the capacity to mobilize concessional loans to its poorest members, and co-created the Global Sovereign Debt Roundtable. It also secured a 50 percent quota increase to bolster the Funds permanent resources and agreed to add a third Sub-Saharan African chair to the IMF Board. Looking ahead, the Board welcomes Ms. Georgievas ongoing emphasis on issues of macroeconomic and financial stability, while also ensuring that the Fund continues to adapt and evolve to meet the needs of its entire membership. It recognizes her focus on strengthening the Funds support to its members through effective policy advice, capacity development and financing. The Board looks forward to continuing to work closely with the Managing Director.",

        "date": "April 13, 2024 11:46 am",
        "content": "US President Joe Biden says he expects Iran to attack Israel sooner than later, as fears grow of Iranian retaliation over an air strike that killed top commanders early this month. Israel has not admitted attacking an Iranian consulate in Syria but is widely believed to have been behind it. US officials have told CBS News, the BBCs US partner, that a major attack on Israel could happen imminently. Israel says it is ready to defend itself. Mr Biden told Iran: Dont. We are devoted to the defence of Israel. We will support Israel, Mr Biden said. We will help defend Israel and Iran will not succeed. Iran backs Hamas, the Palestinian group fighting Israel in Gaza, as well as various proxy groups throughout the region, including some - such as Hezbollah in Lebanon - that frequently carry out strikes against the Israelis. On Friday, Hezbollah said it had launched dozens of rockets from Lebanon towards Israel. An Israel Defense Forces (IDF) spokesman said around 40 missiles and two explosive drones had been launched. No casualties were reported and there were no indications of involvement from other actors. A US official told CBS the barrage was separate from any expected Iranian attack on Israel. BBC Security Correspondent Frank Gardner says Iran is deliberately keeping the Middle East and Washington guessing. Ever since the lethal 1 April strike on the consulate building in Damascus, from which Israel believes Iran was directing its covert arms supplies to Iranian proxies in Lebanon and Syria, Irans security establishment has been debating its response. This is all about calibration. Hit too hard and Israel will respond with devastating force. Go too lightly and Iran will risk being seen as weak and ineffective. From a tactical perspective, it makes no sense for Iran to respond right now, when the region is on full alert and when the US has been telling the world what to expect. Pragmatists in Tehran and Qom will be urging restraint, while hawks, including the ageing Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Khamenei, will be demanding a firm response. But Iran does not want a full-scale war, nor do its neighbours on the Arab side of the Gulf. Governments there have already asked Iran for restraint. The question now, our correspondent says, is whether it is the hawks or the doves who prevail. The mounting tensions have led countries including the US, UK, India and Australia to warn against travel to Israel. Germany called on its citizens to leave Iran. The US state department also barred diplomatic staff and their families in Israel from travelling outside the cities of Tel Aviv, Jerusalem and Beersheba. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has met members of his war cabinet amid the warnings. Some Israelis said they were not worried about a potential Iranian attack. We know that we are surrounded by enemies, in the south, in the north, the east and the west, Daniel Kosman told AFP news agency at a market in Jerusalem. We are not afraid, I can promise you. Look around: people are going out. The Israeli government has not issued any new advice to its people on top of existing guidance to stock up on water, food for three days and essential medicine. Israeli radio, however, reported local authorities had been told to prepare for the possibility of an attack, including by assessing the readiness of public shelters. Last week, the Israeli military cancelled home leave for combat troops, bolstered air defences and called up reservists. Thirteen people were killed in the 1 April missile strike on the Iranian consulate in Damascus. They included senior Iranian military leaders, among them Brig Gen Mohammad Reza Zahedi, a senior commander of Irans elite Quds Force in Syria and Lebanon. Israel has not commented but is widely considered to have carried out the attack. Officials in several countries have been trying to dissuade Iran from launching an attack, fearing it could spark a wider regional war. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has spoken to the foreign ministers of China, Saudi Arabia and Turkey in an attempt to convince them to use their influence with Iran. After meeting the commander of US Central Command on Friday, Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said the bond between the two countries had been strengthened by the threat, adding we will know how to respond. The war in Gaza was sparked when Hamas attacked Israeli communities near the Gaza Strip, killing about 1,200 people, most of them civilians, and taking more than 250 hostage. Israel says that of 130 hostages still in Gaza, at least 34 are dead. More than 33,600 Gazans, the majority of them civilians, have been killed during Israels campaign in Gaza, the Hamas-run health ministry says. The conflict has also seen Israel trade almost daily fire across its northern border with Hezbollah, while Iran-backed groups in Iraq and Yemen have attempted to hit Israeli territory as well as US bases in Iraq and Syria. Yemens Houthi movement has also attacked shipping in the Red Sea, sinking at least one ship and prompting the US and UK to conduct air strikes on Houthi targets in Yemen. Source: BBC -Agencies",

        "content": "The inauspicious time (Punya Kaalaya or Nonagathaya) of 2024 Sinhala and Tamil New Year commenced a short while ago at 2.41 p.m. and is slated to end at 3.29 a.m. tomorrow (14). Sri Lankans are set to celebrate the dawn of the traditional New Year this year at 9.05 p.m. today (13). The New Year, known as Aluth Avurudda in Sinhala, and Puththandu in Tamil, is celebrated by both communities by observing various rituals and customs. According to traditional astrological belief, the Sun completes its movement across the twelve segments of the Zodiac in the course of a year taking one month to travel each constellation. The transition of the Sun from the House of Pisces to the House of Aries marks the beginning of the New Year (Aluth Avurudu). A number of customs and traditional beliefs are associated with Avurudu celebrations in Sri Lanka. The Sinhalese are influenced by astrological faiths and perform several religious practices during this time. This year, deciding on the best date for the New Year celebrations was marred by a disputation among the 42-member group of astrologers employed by the Cultural Affairs Ministry, with one of them accusing the others of misinterpreting the position of stars. Despite the majority setting the dawn of the traditional Sinhala and Tamil New Year on the night of April 13, one astrologer claimed that this auspicious time was wrong and would lead the country into disaster. Against this backdrop, the Ministry of Buddha Sasana, Religious and Cultural Affairs issued a special statement regarding the matter, urging the public to follow the official list of auspicious times issued by the State Astrologers Committee. Auspicious times of 2024 Sinhala and Tamil New Year are as below: Dawn of the New Year New Year will dawn at 9.05 p.m. on 13 April (Saturday) Inauspicious Time (Punya Kaalaya or Nonagathaya) Punya Kalaya or inauspicious time begins at 2.41 p.m. on 13 April (Saturday) and ends at 3.29 a.m. on 14 April (Sunday) Preparation of Meals Preparing meals for the New Year should begin at 11.06 p.m. on 13 April (Saturday).

        "content": "An attacker who fatally knifed five people in a Sydney mall was shot dead by police in Sydneys beachside suburb of Bondi on Saturday, police said, as hundreds fled the scene. The assailant was shot by a police officer after he engaged with nine people in the busy Westfield Bondi Junction shopping centre, police said. She discharged a firearm and that person is now deceased. I am advised that there are five victims who are now deceased as a result of the actions of this offender, New South Wales Police Assistant Commissioner Anthony Cooke told a press conference. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said there was no indication yet of the mans motive. This was a horrific act of violence, indiscriminately targeting innocent people going about an ordinary Saturday doing their shopping, he told a press conference. Tonight the first thoughts of all Australians are with the victims of these terrible acts. Australia has some of the worlds toughest gun and knife laws, and attacks such as the one on Saturday are rare. ON THE RAMPAGE Emergency services were called to the mall just before 4 p.m. (0600 GMT) after the stabbing reports, police said. Eight people, including a child, had been taken to hospital, said a New South Wales Ambulance spokesperson. Reese Colmenares, an eyewitness who hid in a hardware store with 20 others when people started running out of the mall, said she saw a baby with stab wounds being taken to an ambulance. The mother was terrified, the mother was sad, just holding (and) comforting the baby, she told Reuters. Two other witnesses told Reuters they heard shots fired. Even 20 minutes after people were rushed out of the mall, I saw SWAT teams of people sweeping the surrounding streets, one witness said. The other said they saw a woman lying on the ground and took shelter in a jewellery store. An eyewitness described the police officer shooting the attacker to state broadcaster ABC. If she did not shoot him, he would have kept going, he was on the rampage, said the man, who did not give his name. She went over and was giving him CPR. He had a nice big blade on him. He looked like he was on a killing spree. Several posts on social media showed crowds fleeing the mall and police cars and emergency services rushing to the area. Source: Reuters -Agencies",

        "date": "April 13, 2024 06:59 pm",
        "content": "The Bar Association of Sri Lanka (BASL) has expressed its utmost outrage and horror at the recent assault of a young man allegedly perpetrated by officers of the Medawachchiya Police Traffic Division on April 07. It is understood that the assault also necessitated the surgical removal of one testicle of the victim two days later while being treated at the Anuradhapura Teaching Hospital. In a statement published on Saturday (13), the BASL vehemently condemned any use of brutality by police officers while carrying out their official duties. Such reprehensible acts not only contravene the fundamental principles of justice and human rights but also violate international instruments such as the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. Furthermore, we underscore the obligations enshrined in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), which unequivocally prohibits torture or any form of cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment. Such actions also stand in stark violation of Article 11 of our Constitution, which guarantees freedom from torture or cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment. Further, the BASL said that it is deeply concerned by custodial deaths and the attribution of the cause for such deaths to dubious circumstances including the purported attempts of detainees to escape, necessitating officers having to discharge their firearms. The bar association went on to highlight that it has consistently condemned these and similar acts by law enforcement officials, recognizing them as egregious breaches of the rule of law. This recent incident is particularly alarming, raising the chilling spectre of a descent into a police state. The people of Sri Lanka have a fundamental right to live free from fear of violence from those entrusted with their protection. The Constitution guarantees them this right, and the BASL will not tolerate its erosion. Stressing that it will be closely monitoring this case, the BASL urged the authorities to take all necessary legal measures to ensure such heinous acts are not repeated. The BASL also called for swift and transparent action in this case, adding that the perpetrators must be held accountable to the fullest extent of the law.",

No one has claimed the responsibility for the Friday night attack in Balochistan province in Pakistans southwest. Separatist ethnic Baloch militant groups in the mineral-rich region have been fighting for decades against the state, saying it denies them their share of regional resources. Several gunmen intercepted the Iran-bound bus in Noshki district, taking the nine men with them after determining they were from the eastern province of Punjab, said police officer Abdullah Mengal. All of them were travelling to Taftan, he said. The victims were shot at close range, he said. Their bullet-ridden bodies were found from beneath a bridge after one and a half hour, said the district deputy commissioner, Habibullah Musakhail. Ethnic Baloch insurgents have previously claimed responsibility for similar killings in the region, which is home to deep-water Gwadar sea port being developed by neighbouring China. The insurgents have also targeted Chinese nationals and their interests.

        "content": "Japans population fell 595,000 from a year earlier to total 124,352,000 as of Oct. 1 for the 13th consecutive year of decline, according to government data released Friday, as the Asian nation continues to grapple with a declining birthrate and a rapidly graying society. The population of Japanese nationals fell 837,000 to 121,193,000, marking the largest drop since comparable data became available in 1950, according to a demographic survey by the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications. Those 75 or above rose 713,000 to about 20.08 million, eclipsing the 20 million mark for the first time. The number of people from zero to 14 years old fell 329,000 to about 14.17 million, accounting for 11.4 of the total population, the lowest ever. Those between 15 and 64 dropped 256,000 to about 73.95 million, 59.5 of the total population. Meanwhile, the foreign national population rose 243,000 to about 3.16 million. Foreign workers and students who had been in Japan more than 90 days were counted in the overall population figure, according to the ministry. Among the countrys 47 prefectures, only Tokyo saw a rise in population, the second straight year of increase for the Japanese capital. In an estimate released by a national population institute the same day, single-person households were forecast to account for 44.3 of the 52.61 million households in Japan in 2050, with nearly half of them made up of people 65 or older. In 2020, the number of single households accounted for 38 of the total. Among the elderly living alone in 2050, 59.7 of men and 30.2 of women are projected to have never married, up from 33.7 and 11.9, respectively, in 2020, according to the data by National Institute of Population and Social Security Research. The projected trend suggests that the central and local governments need to enhance support for elderly people in areas such as nursing care. Source: Nikkei Asia -Agencies",

        "date": "April 14, 2024 02:38 am",
        "content": "Iran has fired multiple drones and cruise missiles toward Israel, escalating fears of wider conflict in the region. The Israeli military revealed the drones had been launched in a statement late on Saturday night, stressing that they would take several hours to arrive. Shortly after, Irans Revolutionary Guards confirmed the strike, adding that it had also launched missiles against specific targets in Israel. Neighbouring Jordan declared a state of emergency following the launch. It comes after months of ratcheting tensions in the region over Israels war in Gaza reached new levels last week, as Iran vowed retaliation for a strike that killed senior Iranian military officers in its embassy compound in Damascus, for which Israel has neither confirmed nor denied responsibility. The White House said on Saturday that Joe Biden had cut short his weekend plans to confer with national security advisers, a day after the US president warned Iran against attacking Israel  but said such a scenario could be imminent. Hours later, Irans Revolutionary Guards seized a cargo ship in the Strait of Hormuz on Saturday, saying the vessel was linked to Israel, as Jordan declared its airspace closed, in a possible precautionary move given the likelihood of its territory being overflown by any missiles exchanged by Iran and Israel. On Saturday night Israeli broadcaster Channel 12 TV reported that Iran had launched dozens of pilotless aircraft, with retired general Amos Yadlin claiming to the broadcaster that the drones were equipped with 20 kg of explosives each. An IDF spokesperson confirmed prime minister Benjamin Netanyahus plane was airborne for operational reasons. In a broadcast statement, IDF spokesperson Daniel Hagari said: We are going to try and prevent them from reaching Israeli territory. That is our task. If they do enter Israeli airspace, you will hear sirens and alarms wherever these threats enter and we will intercept them. If there is a different type of threat on a different timetable we will inform you immediately on all platforms. He added: The IDF is well-prepared. All of its elements, both on the defensive and on the offensive, are prepared. We have prepared for diverse scenarios in advance. We operate in close collaboration with the US and our other partners in the region. In order to intersect these launches, we have the circles of protection from both the Navy and the Air Force on several layers, and we have additional circles of protection from the US military. We have an excellent air defence system and it is now in full operation, but you must remember it is never 100 per cent. Dozens of drones were seen flying from the direction of Iran over Iraq, two Iraqi security sources told Reuters, while a US official briefed on the attack also told the Associated Press that Iran had launched dozens of drones.

In Washington, President Joe Biden said U.S. forces helped Israel down nearly all the drones and missiles and pledged to convene allies to develop a unified response. The attack, less than two weeks after a suspected Israeli strike in Syria that killed two Iranian generals in an Iranian consular building, marked the first time Iran has launched a direct military assault on Israel, despite decades of enmity dating back to the countrys 1979 Islamic Revolution. Condemnation from the United Nations chief and others was swift, with France saying Iran is risking a potential military escalation, Britain calling the attack reckless and Germany saying Iran and its proxies must stop it immediately. The Israeli militarys spokesman, Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, said Iran fired scores of drones, cruise missiles and ballistic missiles  with the vast majority intercepted outside Israels borders. He said warplanes intercepted over 10 cruise missiles alone, also outside Israeli airspace. Hagari said a handful of missiles landed in Israel. Rescuers said a 7-year-old girl in a Bedouin Arab town was seriously wounded in southern Israel, apparently in a missile strike, though they said police were still investigating the circumstances of her injuries. Hagari said a missile struck an army base, causing light damage but no injuries. A wide-scale attack by Iran is a major escalation, he said. Asked whether Israel would respond, Hagari said only that the army does and will do whatever is required to protect the security of the state of Israel. He said the incident was not over, and dozens of Israeli warplanes remained in the skies. Israels military said its Arrow system, which shoots down ballistic missiles outside the atmosphere, handled most interceptions and noted that strategic partners were involved. At my direction, to support the defense of Israel, the U.S. military moved aircraft and ballistic missile defense destroyers to the region over the course of the past week, Biden said in a statement. Thanks to these deployments and the extraordinary skill of our service members, we helped Israel take down nearly all of the incoming drones and missiles. Biden and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke early Sunday, Israeli time, their governments said. Biden said in his statement that he reaffirmed Americas ironclad commitment to Israels security  a departure from his growing criticism of Israels conduct in its war on Hamas in Gaza. Iran had vowed revenge since the April 1 airstrike in Syria, which Tehran accused Israel of being responsible for. Israel hasnt commented on it. Israel and Iran have been on a collision course throughout Israels six-month war against Hamas militants in Gaza. The war erupted after Hamas and Islamic Jihad, two militant groups backed by Iran, carried out a devastating cross-border attack on Oct. 7 that killed 1,200 people in Israel and kidnapped 250 others. An Israeli offensive in Gaza has caused widespread devastation and killed over 33,000 people, according to local health officials. Almost immediately after the war erupted, Hezbollah, an Iranian-backed militant group in Lebanon, began attacking Israels northern border. The two sides have been involved in daily exchanges of fire, while Iranian-backed groups in Iraq, Syria and Yemen have launched rockets and missiles toward Israel. In a statement carried late Saturday by Irans state-run IRNA news agency, the countrys paramilitary Revolutionary Guard acknowledged launching dozens of drones and missiles towards the occupied territories and positions of the Zionist regime. In a later statement, the Revolutionary Guard issued a direct warning to the U.S.: The terrorist U.S. government is warned any support or participation in harming Irans interests will be followed by decisive and regretting response by Irans armed forces. IRNA also quoted an anonymous official saying ballistic missiles were part of the attack. A ballistic missile moves on an arch trajectory, heading up into space before gravity brings the weapon down at a speed several times faster than the speed of sound. Israel has a multilayered air-defense network that includes systems capable of intercepting a variety of threats including long-range missiles, cruise missiles, drones and short-range rockets. However, in a massive attack involving multiple drones and missiles, the likelihood of a strike making it through is higher. Iran has a vast arsenal of drones and missiles. Online videos shared by Iranian state television purported to show delta-wing-style drones resembling the Iranian Shahed-136s long used by Russia in its war on Ukraine. The slow-flying drones carry bombs. Ukraine has successfully used both surface-to-air missiles and ground fire to target them. Some Israelis watched the interceptions light up the night sky. Air raid sirens were reported in numerous places including northern Israel, southern Israel, the northern West Bank and the Dead Sea near the Jordanian border. Israels army ordered residents in the Golan Heights  near the Syrian and Lebanese borders  as well as the southern towns of Nevatim and Dimona and the Red Sea resort of Eilat into protective spaces. Dimona is home to Israels main nuclear facility, and Nevatim has a major air base. Loud booms were heard in Jerusalem and northern and southern Israel. The armys Home Front Command canceled school Sunday and limited public gatherings to no more than 1,000 people. Israel and some other countries in the region closed their airspace. Earlier, Netanyahu warned: Whoever harms us, we will harm them. In Washington, Biden convened a principals meeting of the National Security Council to discuss the attack. Gen. Erik Kurilla, the head of the U.S. militarys Central Command, was in Israel over the weekend consulting with Israeli defense officials. The Central Command oversees U.S. forces in the Middle East. Irans mission to the United Nations issued a warning to both Israel and the U.S. Should the Israeli regime make another mistake, Irans response will be considerably more severe, it wrote online. It is a conflict between Iran and the rogue Israeli regime, from which the U.S. MUST STAY AWAY! For days, Iranian officials including Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei had threatened to slap Israel for the Syria strike. In Irans capital, Tehran, witnesses saw long lines at gas stations early Sunday as people appeared worried about what may come next. Dozens of hard-liners demonstrated in support of the attack at Palestine Square. Lebanons state-run National News Agency reported heavy Israeli airstrikes and shelling on multiple locations in south Lebanon following Irans launch of drones. The Lebanese militant group Hezbollah said it launched dozens of Katyusha rockets at an Israeli military site in the Golan Heights early Sunday. It was not immediately clear if there was any damage. Iranian missiles or drones were intercepted in the sky above the Jordanian capital, Amman. In Lebanons capital, Beirut, and elsewhere in the country, residents reported seeing missiles in the sky and hearing explosions, likely from interceptions. In Syria, explosions were heard in the capital, Damascus, and elsewhere. Britain-based war monitor the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported that Syrian air defenses tried to shoot down Israeli attempts to intercept Iranian missiles. Source: AP --Agencies",

        "date": "April 14, 2024 02:11 pm",
        "content": "The local multi-day fishing trawler seized by Sri Lanka Navy while carrying a large haul of narcotics off Dondra, in southern Sri Lanka has been brought to the Galle Harbour, along with the arrested suspects. The Commander of the Navy, Vice Admiral Priyantha Perera arrived at the Galle Harbour to inspect the massive consignment of narcotics taken into custody in this operation. Sri Lanka Navy intercepted a local multi-day fishing trawler carrying a large haul of narcotics, with 06 suspects aboard about 133 nautical miles (about 246 km) off Dondra, in southern Sri Lanka. During the operation, the navy seized another local one-day fishing trawler with 04 suspects, believed to have been there to fetch the consignment of narcotics mid-sea. The operation was mounted by deploying Sri Lanka Coast Guard Ship (SLCG) Samudraraksha which made the apprehension on April 12, 2024. The haul of narcotics included about 179kg and 906g of crystal methamphetamine (Ice) and about 83kg and 582g of heroin, the navy said. Meanwhile, the gross street value of the consignment of drugs seized during this operation is believed to be more than Rs. 3,798 million. The suspicious multi-day fishing trawler was intercepted and searched by SLCG Samudraraksha based on naval intelligence whereas the smuggled haul of crystal methamphetamine and heroin in 17 sacks were found.

        "title": "Israel hails success after blocking unprecedented attack from Iran",
        "date": "April 14, 2024 02:48 pm",
        "content": "Israel on Sunday hailed its successful air defenses in the face of an unprecedented attack by Iran, saying it and its allies thwarted 99 of the more than 300 drones and missiles launched toward its territory. But regional tensions remain high, amid fears of further escalation in the event of a possible Israeli counter-strike. U.S. President Joe Biden said he would convene a meeting of the Group of Seven advanced democracies on Sunday to coordinate a united diplomatic response to Irans brazen attack. The language indicated that the Biden administration does not want Irans assault to spiral into a broader military conflict. Iran launched the attack in response to a strike widely blamed on Israel on an Iranian consular building in Syria earlier this month which killed two Iranian generals. Israel said Iran launched 170 drones, more than 30 cruise missiles and more than 120 ballistic missiles early Sunday. By Sunday morning, Iran said the attack was over and Israel reopened its air space. The two foes have for years been engaged in a shadow war marked by incidents like the Damascus strike. But Sundays assault, which set off air raid sirens across Israel, was the first time Iran has launched a direct military assault on Israel, despite decades of enmity dating back to the countrys 1979 Islamic Revolution. Israel has over the years established  often with the help of the United States  a multilayered air-defense network that includes systems capable of intercepting a variety of threats including long-range missiles, cruise missiles, drones and short-range rockets. That system, along with collaboration with the U.S. and other forces, helped thwart what could have been a far more devastating assault at a time when Israel is already bogged down in its war against Hamas in Gaza and engaged in low-level fighting on its northern border with Lebanons Hezbollah militia. Both Hamas and Hezbollah are backed by Iran. Israeli and U.S. officials lauded the response to the aerial assault. Iran launched more than 300 threats and 99 were intercepted, said Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, the Israeli military spokesman. That is a success. Asked if Israel would respond, Hagari said the country would do what was needed to protect its citizens. Hagari said that none of the drones and cruise missiles reached Israel and that only a few of the ballistic missiles got through. He said that of the cruise missiles, 25 were shot down by the Israeli air force. Hagari said minor damage was caused to an Israeli airbase, but he said it was still functioning. Rescuers said a 7-year-old girl was seriously wounded in southern Israel, apparently in a missile strike, though they said police were still investigating the circumstances of her injuries. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu posted a short message on X, formerly Twitter: We intercepted. We blocked. Together, we will win. Defense Minister Yoav Gallant also celebrated the results, thanking the U.S. and other countries for their assistance. He said Israel needs to remain vigilant and prepare for any scenario, but called the interceptions a great success. Israel announced it reopened its airspace, loosening one restriction it had imposed ahead of the strike, although schools remained closed around the country. Neighboring Jordan also reopened its airspace. Gen. Mohammad Hossein Bagheri, the chief of staff of the Iranian armed forces, said the operation was over, the state-run IRNA news agency reported. We have no intention of continuing the operation against Israel, he was quoted as saying. Israel may be particularly proud of the success of its defense because it stands in sharp contrast to the failures it endured during Hamas attack on Oct. 7. Facing a far less powerful enemy in Hamas, Israels border defenses collapsed and the military took days to repel the marauding militants  an embarrassing defeat for the Middle Easts strongest and best-equipped army. While thwarting the Iranian onslaught could help restore Israels image, what it does next will be closely watched both in the region and in Western capitals. In Washington, Biden said U.S. forces helped Israel down nearly all the drones and missiles and pledged to convene allies to develop a unified response. Biden, who had cut short a weekend stay at his Delaware beach house to meet with his national security team at the White House on Saturday afternoon, spoke with Netanyahu later in the day. I told him that Israel demonstrated a remarkable capacity to defend against and defeat even unprecedented attacks  sending a clear message to its foes that they cannot effectively threaten the security of Israel, Biden said. In a statement Sunday, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the U.S. does not seek escalation, and would hold talks with its allies in the coming days. The U.S., along with its allies, has sent direct messages to Tehran to warn against further escalating the conflict. Leaders from the G7 will hold a video conference on Sunday early afternoon to discuss the Iranian strikes against Israel, according to Italy, which holds the presidency of the group of developed countries, which includes the United States, Japan, Germany, France, Britain, and Canada. Irans paramilitary Revolutionary Guard issued a new threat against the U.S. The terrorist U.S. government is warned any support or participation in harming Irans interests will be followed by decisive and regretting response by Irans armed forces, said a statement carried by IRNA. Iran had vowed revenge since the April 1 airstrike in Syria, for which Tehran held Israel responsible. Israel hasnt publicly commented on it. Israel and Iran have been on a collision course throughout Israels six-month war against Hamas militants in Gaza, triggered by the Oct. 7 attack on Israel. On that day, militants from Hamas and Islamic Jihad, also backed by Iran, killed 1,200 people in Israel and kidnapped 250 others. An Israeli offensive in Gaza has caused widespread devastation and killed over 33,000 people, according to local health officials. Negotiations underway, meant to bring about a cease-fire in exchange for the release of the hostages, appeared to hit a setback Sunday. Netanyahus office said that Hamas rejected the latest proposal for a deal, which had been presented to Hamas a week ago by mediators Qatar, Egypt and the United States. A Hamas official said the group wants a clear written commitment that Israel will withdraw from the Gaza Strip during the second of a three-phase cease-fire deal. The deal presented to the sides calls for a six-week cease-fire in Gaza, during which Hamas would release 40 of the more than 100 hostages the group is holding in the enclave in exchange for 900 Palestinian prisoners from Israels jails, including 100 serving long sentences for serious crimes. Hamas welcomed Irans attack, saying it was a natural right and a deserved response to the strike in Syria and urged the Iran-backed groups in the region to continue to support Hamas in the war against Israel. Almost immediately after the war erupted, Hezbollah began attacking Israels northern border. The two sides have been involved in daily exchanges of fire, while Iranian-backed groups in Iraq, Syria and Yemen have launched rockets and missiles toward Israel.

        "content": "The Sri Lankan Ambassador to Israel, Nimal Bandara has assured that all Sri Lankans living in Israel are safe amidst attacks carried out by Iran. Issuing a statement, Mr. Bandara said that although Iran targeted Israel with more than 500 shells and missiles last night (April 13), Israels Iron Dome system has managed to neutralize all of them. Apart from an injury to a little girl Israeli, no one in Israel has been reported to have been injured so far, the Sri Lankan envoy in Tel Aviv assured. Meanwhile, he stated that flight FZ 1625 belonging to the Fly Dubai airline operated from Dubai to Tel Aviv last night at 08.10 p.m. while traveling from Dubai to Tel Aviv, was diverted to Dubai as soon as the information about the air attacks came to light. Mr. Bandara expressed that there were Sri Lankans on the flight, who were on the way to Israel and that information about them is being disclosed. The Sri Lankan Ambassador in Israel also said: In view of the current situation, flights travelling through Jordan, Lebanon, Iraq, Israel, etc., bypass the region and return to many countries in Europe via other routes. Therefore, I would like to inform the people who have obtained air tickets to travel to the Middle East region and European countries to check their air tickets again. There are delays on flights to and from Israel, he added. Meanwhile, there was an event held at Ganshakar Stadium in Jerusalem with the participation of about two thousand Sri Lankans till 9.00 p.m., Mr. Bandara mentioned, adding that all the Sri Lankans who participated in the event had left for their residences safely. The Embassy of Sri Lanka in Israel is always concerned about the safety of the Sri Lankans here and I would like to inform them not to create any unnecessary fear about their safety, he added.",

        "date": "April 14, 2024 04:11 pm",
        "content": "South Korea will host the second global AI (artificial intelligence) safety summit on May 21-22, six months after Britain held the inaugural event at Bletchley Park. In a statement published on Friday, government officials said the event would build on the Bletchley Declaration, an agreement between countries - including the U.S. and China - to cooperate on AI safety. CONTEXT When Microsoft-backed (MSFT.O), OpenAI released ChatGPT in late 2022, many were impressed, while some were alarmed. Former Google researcher and godfather of AI Geoffrey Hinton said the technology posed a more urgent threat to the world than climate change. Elon Musk called for an immediate pause in the development of such systems. In November last year, Britain hosted the first AI Safety Summit, bringing together world leaders, tech moguls and academics to discuss how best to regulate the rapidly developing technology. After the two-day event, more than 25 government representatives signed a joint declaration agreeing that countries would work together and establish a common approach on oversight. In order to keep pace with the technology, it was agreed that future summits would take place every six months. South Korea will hold a largely virtual event in May, with France hosting the next in-person summit later in 2024. KEY QUOTES The AI Safety Summit held in Bletchley last year marked a milestone in which the government, industry and academia came together to address the potential risks of AI, and I am pleased that the Republic of Korea takes the baton from the UK, said Lee Jong-Ho of South Koreas ministry of science and information and communication technology. AI is advancing at an unprecedented pace that exceeds our expectations, and it is crucial to establish global norms and governance to harness such technological innovations to enhance the welfare of humanity.

        "content": "A total of 607 search and rescue personnel and 10 helicopters were involved, including teams from Turkeys emergency response agency, AFAD, the Coast Guard, firefighting teams and mountain rescue teams from different parts of Turkey, officials said. Helicopters with night-vision capabilities had continued rescuing people throughout the night. The stranded people had been stuck on the Tunektepe cable car, just outside the Mediterranean city of Antalya, since 5:30 p.m. on Friday, when the accident occurred. Istanbul resident Hatice Polat and her family were rescued seven hours into the ordeal. Speaking to the Anadolu agency, she said the power went out and the pod flipped four or five times. The night was awful, we were very scared. There were children with us, they passed out, she said. It was torture being up there for seven hours. It is swaying every second, youre constantly in fear. ... It was very traumatic, I dont know how well get over this trauma. State-run Anadolu Agency identified the deceased as a 54-year-old Turkish man. Those injured included two children and were six Turkish citizens and one Kyrgyz national. They were all rescued by Coast Guard helicopters soon after the crash and sent for treatment. Images in Turkish media showed the battered car swaying from dislodged cables on the side of the rocky mountain as medics tended the wounded. Yerlikaya also announced that 13 people rescued from other cars were also taken to hospitals for checkups. Friday was the final day of a three-day public holiday in Turkey marking the end of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, which sees families flock to coastal resorts. The cable car carries tourists from Konyaalti beach to a restaurant and viewing platform at the summit of the 618-meter (2,010-foot) Tunektepe peak. It is run by Antalya Metropolitan Municipality. The cable car line was completed in 2017 and receives a major inspection around the beginning of the year, as well as routine inspections throughout the year. Antalya Chief Public Prosecutors Office has launched an investigation. An expert commission including mechanical and electrical engineers and health and safety experts was assigned to determine the cause of the incident. Source: The Associated Press --Agencies",

        "title": "Sri Lanka among countries that could benefit from debt-for-nature swaps, says report",
        "date": "April 15, 2024 07:48 am",
        "content": "(Reuters) - Debt-for-nature swaps, where poorer countries have debt written off in return for protecting ecosystems such as barrier reefs or rainforests, could provide 100 billion for the fight against climate change, a new report has calculated. The UK-based, non-profit International Institute for Environment and Development (IIED) based the estimate on the possibility of debt swaps in many of the 49 less developed countries seen as most at risk of debt crises. Belize, Ecuador, Barbados, Gabon and Cabo Verde have all done such swaps in recent years and Laura Kelly, the director of IIEDs sustainable markets research group, said many of those in debt distress and also often most threatened by global warming, were looking at them. The IMF and World Bank, whose figures the analysis is based on, estimate the countries focused on collectively owe 431 billion, mostly to wealthier governments, the IMF itself and pension and hedge funds. At the same time, these countries received less than 14 billion in climate finance according to OECD figures from 2021, which is significantly less than they need to limit climate change or at least adapt to it. The aim of IIEDs report is to encourage a drive for more debt swaps at the upcoming IMF and World Bank Spring meetings which start later this week. Kelly said countries that could benefit included Pakistan, Sri Lanka and The Gambia in West Africa, which is at huge risk of sea level rise she stressed and needs to invest heavily in flood prevention and wetland preservation. Ghana too, which like Sri Lanka is now restructuring its debt, is another obvious candidate. One of its key exports, cocoa beans used for chocolate, could thrive if more is done to protect its vital rainforests. For governments (that do debt swaps) it creates some fiscal space, but also it helps to achieve outcomes in terms of climate and nature that have global impact, Kelly said, adding that many countries were interested in potentially doing them.

        "title": "US will not take part in any Israeli retaliatory action against Iran",
        "date": "April 15, 2024 09:11 am",
        "content": "(Reuters) - President Joe Biden warned Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu the U.S. will not take part in a counter-offensive against Iran, an option Netanyahus war cabinet favors after a mass drone and missile attack on Israeli territory, according to officials. The threat of open warfare erupting between the arch Middle East foes and dragging in the United States put the region on edge, triggering calls for restraint from global powers and Arab nations. The Middle East is on the brink. The people of the region are confronting a real danger of a devastating full-scale conflict. Now is the time to defuse and de-escalate, United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres told a Security Council meeting called on Sunday in response to the strikes. Deputy U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Robert Wood called on the council to unequivocally condemn Irans attack. Let me be clear: if Iran or its proxies take actions against the United States or further action against Israel, Iran will be held responsible, he said. Still, Biden told Netanyahu the U.S. would not participate in any Israeli counter-offensive against Iran over the attack, a White House official said. U.S. State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin also spoke to counterparts including in Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Egypt and Jordan, stressing the need to avoid escalation, the importance of a coordinated diplomatic response, and emphasizing the U.S. will continue to support Israels defense. LITTLE SERIOUS DAMAGE Iran launched the attack over a suspected Israeli strike on its embassy compound in Syria on April 1 that killed top Revolutionary Guards commanders and followed months of clashes between Israel and Irans regional allies, triggered by the war in Gaza. However, the attack by more than 300 missiles and drones caused only modest damage in Israel. Most were shot down by Israels Iron Dome defense system and with help from the U.S., Britain, France and Jordan. The only serious injury reported within Israel was a 7-year-old who was hurt by shrapnel. There also was little serious property damage reported. Authorities said an Israeli Air Force base was hit but continued to operate as normal. Asian shares fell and gold prices rose on Monday as risk sentiment took a hit, though oil prices dipped. An attack was largely priced in the days leading up to it. Also the limited damage and the fact that there was no loss of life means that maybe Israels response will be more measured, said Warren Patterson, head of commodities strategy at ING. But clearly, there is still plenty of uncertainty and it all depends on how Israel now responds. Israeli officials said Netanyahus five-member war cabinet favored retaliation in a meeting on Sunday, although the panel was divided over the timing and scale of any such response. Two senior Israeli ministers signalled retaliation was not imminent and that Israel would not act alone. We will build a regional coalition and exact the price from Iran in the fashion and timing that is right for us, centrist minister Benny Gantz said ahead of a war cabinet meeting. Defence Minister Yoav Gallant also said Israel had an opportunity to form a strategic alliance against this grave threat by Iran. Israel remained on high alert, but authorities lifted some emergency measures that had included a ban on some school activities and caps on large gatherings. Iranian army chief of staff Major General Mohammad Bagheri said on television, Our response will be much larger than tonights military action if Israel retaliates against Iran, and told Washington that its bases could also be attacked if it helped Israel retaliate. Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian said Tehran had informed the United States its attack on Israel would be limited and for self-defence and that regional neighbours had been informed of its planned strikes 72 hours in advance. Turkish, Jordanian and Iraqi officials said on Sunday that Iran gave wide notice days before the attack, but U.S. officials said Tehran did not warn Washington and was aiming to cause significant damage. The leaders of the Group of 7 nations condemned Irans attack and said they would work to stabilize the situation, warning in a statement that Tehran risked an uncontrollable regional escalation. MOTIVATIONS FOR ATTACK DEBATED Analysts debated whether Irans attack was calibrated to cause genuine devastation in Israel, or to save face at home after vows of revenge while avoiding a major new war. I think the Iranians took into consideration the fact that Israel has a very, very strong multi-layer anti-missile system and they probably took into consideration that there will not be too many casualties, said Sima Shine, a former senior Mossad official at the Institute for National Security Studies in Tel Aviv. In Gaza, Irans attack drew applause as rare payback for an Israeli offensive that has killed at least 33,000 people. We have been slaughtered for over six months and no one dared to do anything. Now Iran, after its consulate was hit, is hitting back at Israel and this brings joy into our hearts, said Majed Abu Hamza of Gaza City. The war in Gaza, which Israel invaded after an attack by Iran-backed Hamas on Oct. 7, has spread to fronts with Iran-aligned groups in Lebanon, Syria, Yemen and Iraq. In Israel, although there was alarm at the first direct attack from another country in more than three decades, the mood contrasted with the trauma after the Hamas-led attack on Oct.7. I think weve been given license to respond now. I mean it was a major attack from Iran... I imagine Israel will respond and may be over quickly and get back to normal life, said Jeremy Smith, 60. In Iran, state television showed small gatherings in several cities celebrating the attack, but in private some Iranians were worried about Israels response. Iran gave Netanyahu a golden opportunity to attack our country. But we, the people of Iran, will bear the brunt of this conflict, said Shima, a nurse, from Tehran. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "date": "April 15, 2024 01:32 pm",
        "content": "Dogs will soon be able to experience their own furst class flight with the launch of the worlds first jet charter company specifically designed for mans best friend. BARK, the dog toy company that coordinates the popular treat subscription BarkBox, is partnering with a jet charter service to take away the challenges of long-distance traveling with dogs, according to a press release. BARK Air, as the company calls it, offers the white glove experience typical of a humans first-class experience and redirected all that pampering to pooches. Taking dogs on airplanes is, typically, a stressful endeavor with different airlines having different policies for pet travel. For example, American Airlines allows small dogs in a carrier to be placed under the seat in front, but larger dogs are put in the cargo space, which has been found to be stressful for the pet. For United Airlines, pets can fly in the cabin if theres enough space, but they must fit in a carrier under the seat in front. We are excited to take the insights weve learned over years to create an experience that is truly dog-first, which is drastically different from just accepting dogs  from the ground to the skies, said Matt Meeker, Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer at BARK, in a statement. However, youll need to pay a hefty fee for the dog-friendly flight. For now, a ticket for just one dog and one human will run you at least 6,000 one way. The first BARK Air flights will take off on May 23, and so far, there are only two flight routes available, both from New Yorks Westchester County Airport. From New York to Londons Stansted Airport, itll cost 8,000 one-way and to Los Angeless Van Nuys Airport will cost 6,000 one-way. Tickets are available for purchase on April 11. Not only does BARK Air allow dogs, it also focuses on the furry friends by treating them like VIPs, the press release said. BARK Air passengers can skip TSA checkpoints and screenings and instead experience a simple check-in process where they can meet the other dogs on the flight and the humans are served a meal cooked by on-site chefs. When boarding, a BARK Air concierge is on-hand to ensure the dogs are socializing and adjusting to the environment well. Each flight will undergo Dogs Fly First flight prep that includes calming pheromones, music, and colors that pups prefer. To make the flying experience easier and more enjoyable, dogs have access to various aids such as calming treats, noise-canceling ear muffs, and calming jackets. During takeoff and descent, dogs are given a beverage of their choice to help their ears adjust to cabin pressurization. Of course, there will be plenty of treats on the flight.

        "date": "April 15, 2024 02:53 pm",
        "content": "Nineteen Indian fishermen detained by the Sri Lanka Navy were on Tuesday repatriated to India, the Indian High Commission said, almost a week after a similar number of fishermen were sent back to their home country. 19 Indian fishermen have been repatriated from Sri Lanka and are currently on their way to Chennai, the Indian High Commission here said in a post on X. The Navy has so far held 23 Indian trawlers and 178 Indian fishermen for allegedly fishing in the island nations waters thus far in 2024, and handed them over to authorities for legal action, the Sri Lankan Navy late last month confirmed in a statement. The fishermen issue is a contentious one in the ties between India and Sri Lanka, with Lankan Navy personnel even firing at Indian fishermen in the Palk Strait and seizing their boats in several alleged incidents of illegally entering Sri Lankan territorial waters. On April 3, Nineteen Indian fishermen detained by the Sri Lanka Navy were repatriated to India after being released by authorities here. The release of the 38 Indian fishermen comes amidst a row over the Katchatheevu island issue after the ruling BJP blamed the Congress Party for ceding the tiny island to Sri Lanka in 1974. The Palk Strait, a narrow strip of water separating Tamil Nadu from Sri Lanka, is a rich fishing ground for fishermen from both countries. Fishermen from both countries are arrested frequently for inadvertently trespassing into each others waters. In 2023, the island nations Navy arrested 240 Indian fishermen along with 35 trawlers for allegedly poaching in Sri Lankan waters. Source: News18 --Agencies",

        "title": "In a historic first, Trumps criminal hush money trial kicks off in New York",
        "date": "April 15, 2024 06:50 pm",
        "content": "Donald Trump arrived at a Manhattan court for a historic criminal trial stemming from a hush-money payment to a porn star that could keep him in court for weeks and complicate his bid to win back the White House. Trump, 77, is the first former U.S. president to face a criminal trial. He is required to attend the trial in Manhattan, which could last through May. Jury selection is expected to take about a week, followed by witness testimony. Police stood guard in front of the courthouse amid a maze of barricades ahead of the trials 9:30 a.m. (1330 GMT) start, and helicopters shadowed the motorcade of black SUVs that ferried Trump from his Trump Tower apartment. A handful of protesters, gathered in the plaza across the street, carried hand-painted signs reading LOSER and convict Trump already. Though the case is regarded by some legal experts as the least consequential of the four criminal prosecutions he faces, it is the only one guaranteed to go to trial before the Nov. 5 election. Trump has pleaded not guilty. If convicted, he could still hold office but ReutersIpsos polling shows a guilty verdict could hobble his prospects. The businessman-turned-politician, who served as president from 2017 to 2021, has used past court appearances to rally his supporters and claim he is being persecuted by his political enemies. New York state prosecutors accuse him of falsifying records to cover up a 130,000 payment in the waning days of the 2016 presidential campaign to buy the silence of porn star Stormy Daniels about a 2006 sexual encounter she has said they had. Trump has denied any such relationship. He pleaded not guilty last year to 34 counts of falsification of business records in the case brought by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, a Democrat, in New York state court. In his three other criminal cases, opens new tab, he stands accused of mishandling classified information and trying to overturn his 2020 election loss to Democrat Joe Biden. He has painted all the criminal cases against him as a plot by Bidens Democrats to undermine his presidential campaign. Theres going to be an argument from the defense that this is a politically motivated prosecution, and if they had a real crime theyd have brought a real crime, and instead they have little notations on a checkbook, said Adam Kaufmann, a former prosecutor in the Manhattan district attorneys office. On Monday morning, Trump repeated those claims on social media and said Justice Juan Merchan, who is overseeing the trial, is highly conflicted. Bragg has argued that the case concerns an unlawful scheme to corrupt the 2016 election by burying a scandalous story that would have harmed Trumps campaign. Trumps lawyers have said the payment to Daniels did not amount to an illegal campaign contribution. A ReutersIpsos poll published last week found that nearly two in three voters found the charges in the case at least somewhat serious. One in four of his fellow Republicans and half of independents said they would not vote for Trump if he were convicted of a felony. Choosing a jury from a pool of people from heavily Democratic Manhattan could take several days, to be followed by opening statements and witness testimony. Daniels and Trumps former lawyer Michael Cohen, who has testified that he made the payments to Daniels, are among the witnesses expected to testify. Trump has said he plans to testify in his own defense, a risky proposition that would open him up to probing cross-examination by prosecutors. CATCH AND KILL Prosecutors have said the payment to Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, was part of a broader catch and kill scheme to suppress unflattering information about Trump before the election, in which he defeated Democrat Hillary Clinton. Trump is accused of falsely recording reimbursements to Cohen as monthly legal retainer fees in his New York-based real estate companys books. Falsifying business records in New York is a felony punishable by up to four years in prison, though many defendants convicted of that charge have been sentenced to fines or probation. Trumps defense has argued that his payments to Cohen in 2017, while he was president, were for legal services. Trump has called Cohen a serial liar and his lawyers are expected to attack his credibility at trial. Cohen pleaded guilty in 2018 to violating campaign finance law, though the federal prosecutors who brought that case did not charge Trump. Trumps lawyers lodged three last-minute bids to delay the trial last week. All were rejected by judges. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "title": "India lifts ban on onion exports to Sri Lanka",
        "date": "April 15, 2024 09:02 pm",
        "content": "The Government of India has lifted the export ban on onions for Sri Lanka, according to the Indian High Commission in Colombo. It said the export of onions has been permitted to Sri Lanka, with export of up to 10,000 MT of onions permitted vide the notification of Indias Directorate General of Foreign Trade. The exemption for Sri Lanka reiterated Indias Neighbourhood First policy, adding to the Sinhala and Tamil New Year festivities here, the High Commission said in a statement on Monday. Last month, India extended its ban on onion exports indefinitely in a surprise move that had exacerbated high prices in some overseas markets. Imposed by India - the worlds biggest exporter of the vegetable - in December, the ban was due to expire on March 31. Countries such as Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Malaysia, Nepal and the United Arab Emirates rely on imports from India to fill domestic gaps in onion supply and many of those nations have struggled with high prices since the ban. However, it was reported last week that India was planning to supply thousands of metric tons of onion to Sri Lanka and UAE after supplying vast quantities of essential commodities to Maldives. India on April 3 allowed a supply of additional 10,000 tons of onions over and above its quota to close ally United Arab Emirates (UAE) as the Gulf country is always a priority with New Delhi. Traders estimate that India accounts for more than half of all onion imports by Asian countries. India exported a record 2.5 million metric tons of onions in the financial year that ended on March 31, 2023. --With Agencies Inputs",

        "date": "April 15, 2024 09:28 pm",
        "content": "Several major water and energy projects are going to be inaugurated by the presidents of Iran and Sri Lanka in the near future, Iranian media reported. The Uma Oya Multipurpose project which includes two dams namely Dyraaba and Puhulpola and also 25 kilometers of water transmission tunnel, is expected to be inaugurated in May in the presence of Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi. The project also includes two major hydroelectric power plants each with a capacity of 60 megawatts. Uma Oya multipurpose project is regarded as one of the greatest technical and engineering service projects of Iranian companies in Sri Lanka. This project is located in the south-east of Sri Lanka 200km away from Colombo city. The purpose of the project is to improve irrigation of 5000 acres of agricultural land, transferring 145 million cubic meters of water and generating 290 GWh of power in a year. One of the important features of the Uma Oya project is the scattered and diverse components of the project. It should also be said that this project is one of the largest projects implemented by Iranian contractors abroad. Back in August 2023, Sri Lankan Foreign Minister Ali Sabry visited Iran and met with his Iranian counterpart Hossein Amir Abdollahian in Tehran. During a joint press conference, the top Iranian diplomat called the visit a turning point in Iran-Sri Lanka ties. Amir Abdollahian said the two foreign ministers had discussed cooperation at regional and international levels and will be expanding ties in the fields of trade, tourism, science, and culture. During our meeting, we discussed new possible agreements and also emphasized the implementation of the ones that have already been signed, said the top diplomat. According to Amir Abdollahian, the two sides also discussed the exchange of prisoners. The foreign minister concluded his talks by reiterating the Iranian governments priorities, saying that Tehran attaches great significance to cooperation with fellow Asian countries. He hoped that different nations in the continent could collaborate in a friendly and constructive manner. Sabry, for his part, hailed Sri Lankas good and friendly relations with Iran. Before his visit, Sri Lankan media reported that the foreign minister would be trying to rejuvenate his countrys presence in the Iranian tea market. Source: Tehran Times --Agencies",
