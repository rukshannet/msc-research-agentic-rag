        "title": "Substantial allowance increment for Army personnel after absence of 04 years",
        "date": "June 22, 2023 06:19 pm",
        "content": "The substantial increment of around Rs. 10,000 for all Army personnel, war-affected disabled Army personnel and family members of deceased Army members to their salaries beginning from April, this year has taken place, following a prolonged absence of about 4 years, under the recommendation of President Ranil Wickremesinghe, in response to the request of the Commander of the Army, Lieutenant General Vikum Liyanage. This was reportedly the first time such an increased allowance was paid to them after 2019, the Sri Lanka Army said today. The added increment of this allowance, which is particularly considering the financial difficulties of Army members both living inside and outside for service requirements, serves as a considerable relief to them due to the prevailing economic recession that has occurred in the mid of 2022 and the spiralling cost of living. The Army ration allowance is issued under two categories, namely; Living-In (allowance included in the issued ration) and the Living-Out (allowance paid along with the monthly salary). However, the said Living-In category has received the added increment from the beginning of January this year, but the same had not been added to the Living-Out category till April, this year, according to the Army. Similarly, all the allowances paid to the Army personnel who are on active service, are also paid to all war-affected disabled Army personnel and the next of kin of deceased Army members until the age of the said Army member reaches the age of 55. President Wickremesinghe, together with State Minister of Defence Premitha Bandara Tennakoon, Senior Advisor to the President on National Security and Chief of Staff of the President Sagala Ratnayake, Presidents Secretary Saman Ekanayake, Secretary to Ministry of Defence General Kamal Gunaratne (Retd) and Chief of Defence Staff General Shavendra Silva have positively considered the request of the Commander of the Army and facilitated the increment to the Army and members of the Armed Forces beginning from April 2023.",

        "title": "Trade Minister vows legal measures against non-compliant food manufacturers",
        "date": "June 22, 2023 09:18 pm",
        "content": "Minister of Trade, Commerce, and Food Security Nalin Fernando has stated that legal action would be taken against companies manufacturing non-essential food items that fail to offer relief to the public despite benefiting from government tax concessions. Fernando made these remarks during a press conference organized by the Presidential Media Centre today (22 June), focusing on the theme Collective Path to a Stable Country. The Minister also emphasized the importance of displaying the maximum price of every product sold within the country, adding that legal measures would be taken against companies and manufacturers that fail to comply with this requirement. Moreover, he highlighted that as a result of President Ranil Wickremesinghes prudent decisions, the country successfully saved approximately USD 350 million that would have been otherwise spent on rice imports by the government. Minister Fernando also noted that significant efforts have been made to revise the outdated Consumer Affairs Authority Act, which has been in effect for two decades, in order to safeguard the rights of consumers, the Presidents Media Division (PMD) reported. Expressing his views at the media briefing, Minister Nalin Fernando further said: When President Ranil Wickremesinghe assumed office, our country was grappling with numerous major crises. It was during this challenging period that he entrusted me with a highly sensitive ministry dedicated to the well-being of our people. We were facing severe shortages of certain food items, with supplies lasting only two to three days. The agricultural sector had suffered a significant decline, leading us to resort to unprecedented levels of rice imports. This situation had never been witnessed before in our history. The previous governments fertilizer policy directly contributed to the food crisis we faced. However, the President took the necessary steps to reinstate a program providing fertilizer to our farmers. Thanks to these appropriate decisions, there will be no need for future rice imports. This achievement has resulted in savings of approximately 350 million dollars that were previously spent on rice imports. We are now utilizing these savings to import essential goods for the benefit of our people. Presently, our import system is functioning efficiently. We have strengthened the issuance of Letters of Credit required by importers. People often inquire why the market situation has returned to normal while the prices of goods have not decreased accordingly. Our aim is to reduce food inflation to single-digit figures by December. Compared to 2022, the prices of goods have already decreased. For instance, the price of onions, which was once Rs. 314 per kilo, has now dropped to Rs. 120. Similarly, the prices of various essential items, including potatoes, white sugar, red lentils, chickpeas, and white beans, have decreased. The direct importation of these goods has provided such relief to our people. However, a few local industrialists have yet to take steps to pass on the benefit of lower prices to the consumers. Despite receiving concessions from the government, these industrialists have the capacity to reduce prices even further. The Consumer Authority has been instructed to ensure that prices are not unjustifiably maintained in the future. Additionally, we are in the process of establishing maximum retail prices for tiles, cement, and bathroom accessories. It is our mandate to set a maximum retail price for every product sold within our country. The import reduction of tiles led to an increase in their prices. By strengthening the value of our currency against the dollar, we can introduce competition in this regard. I have urged them to prepare for this challenge. Through the measures implemented by our government, we have created an environment conducive to providing relief to consumers. I have conveyed to these companies the necessity of explaining their price calculations when setting retail prices for cement in the future. The maximum retail price should be determined by considering production costs, profits, and the traders margin. Today, as the Consumer Affairs Authority, our focus is on informing consumers rather than conducting raids. Proper price displays can go a long way in addressing pricing concerns. I have instructed the Consumer Affairs Authority to assess whether price displays are being carried out effectively. To tackle the issue of cost of living, we need to take measures to reduce production costs. Manufacturers should be encouraged to adopt new technologies. We are currently preparing a report to safeguard consumer interests, enabling us to provide goods at lower prices through local producers. While lentils are entirely imported, we must strive to produce locally what is feasible. It is crucial to recognize and work on these aspects. Managing the interests of importers, producers, and consumers is a challenging task. After two decades, we have secured approval to amend the Consumer Authority Act. The Act has now been forwarded to the Attorney Generals Department, which will contribute to protecting consumers on a larger scale. We need to devise programs that facilitate the production of local goods at affordable prices. The government has undertaken significant efforts to strengthen the countrys economy while ensuring consumer protection. I have advocated for the repeal of the archaic Bread Ordinance of 1864. The Ministry of Health, the Department of Weights and Measures, and the Ministry of Trade are hindered by the limitations of this Act. The Ministry of Health oversees quality standards, while the Weights and Measures Department checks weights. The Bread Ordinance is divided into three parts. We are actively working towards its repeal and the introduction of a new bread act. Besides rice, wheat flour is widely consumed by the population. Therefore, we should pay more attention to the price of wheat flour. Fortunately, the prices of various related products, including bread, have already decreased. We anticipate further price reductions in the coming days. To effectively lower the prices of goods, we require the support of other relevant ministries. Moreover, companies that fail to provide relief to consumers will face strict legal consequences. Some companies in our country have not passed on concessions to consumers despite benefiting significantly from the government. They have enjoyed extraordinary profitability. It is crucial for them to consider the welfare of the people. If we aim to develop our nation, we must also reduce the prices of non-essential goods. Construction activities need to resume across the country, and every citizen should have the opportunity to build a house and have access to proper sanitation facilities. Therefore, we anticipate taking legal action against companies that unreasonably increase prices.",

        "title": "Debris field found near Titanic wreckage during search for missing submersible",
        "date": "June 22, 2023 10:12 pm",
        "content": "The US Coast Guard said Thursday a debris field was discovered by a remotely operated vehicle near the Titanic and within the search area for the missing submersible with five people aboard. Experts within the unified command are evaluating the information, the Coast Guard said. It is unclear if this debris field is connected to the missing submersible. The Coast Guard said it plans to host a press briefing at 3 p.m. ET to discuss findings from the Horizon Arctics ROV on the sea floor near the Titanic. The news comes as the search for the vessel has reached a critical stage, the co-founder of the company operating the submersible said Thursday. Today will be a critical day in this search and rescue mission, as the subs life support supplies are starting to run low, Guillermo Sohnlein, the co-founder of OceanGate, the company operating the expedition, said in a statement Thursday. Sohnlein said he is certain that pilot Stockton Rush and the crew realized days ago that the best thing they can do to ensure their rescue is to extend the limits of those supplies by relaxing as much as possible. I firmly believe that the time window available for their rescue is longer than what most people think. The submersible, known as Titan, began its descent Sunday to explore the wreckage of the Titanic with an estimated 96 hours of life support. With estimated oxygen levels ever depleting, the search for the submersible has kicked into high gear. We continue to find in particularly complex cases that peoples will to live really needs to be accounted for  and so were continuing to search and proceed with rescue efforts by bringing this new capability online this morning, US Coast Guard Rear Admiral John Mauger told NBC on Thursday. The Titan lost contact with its mother ship Sunday about 1 hour and 45 minutes into its dive to explore the Titanics wreckage at about 13,000 feet below sea level  a trip that costs participants 250,000, an archived version of its website shows. Aboard the Titan are Rush, the OceanGate CEO and founder, along with British businessman Hamish Harding, Pakistani billionaire Shahzada Dawood and his son Suleman Dawood, and French diver Paul-Henri Nargeolet, according to relatives and social media posts. Officials have not publicly named those aboard. The expedition reflects the ongoing fascination with the Titanics wreckage more than a century after it hit an iceberg and sank on its maiden voyage, killing more than 1,500 people. The journey is also part of the growing business of wealthy adventure tourism, along with the space flights of Blue Origin or the rise of guided tours to Mount Everest. The focus on the vessel has also renewed criticisms of OceanGates approach to safety from employees and other industry leaders. Search and rescue operations growin A remotely operated vehicle (ROV) was looking for the submersible on the sea floor, the US Coast Guards Northeast District tweeted Thursday morning. An ROV from a French vessel has also been deployed, and equipment from Magellan, the team that mapped the Titanic wreckage site last year, was headed to the site to assist. Further, aircraft are scanning a search zone about twice the size of Connecticut and as deep as 2 12 miles, Capt. Jamie Frederick, the response coordinator for the First Coast Guard District, said Wednesday. Medical personnel specializing in dive medicine and a hyperbaric recompression chamber arrived on scene Thursday, according to a spokesperson for the Joint Rescue Coordination Centre Halifax of the Canadian Armed Forces. Banging noises detected underwater Tuesday and Wednesday in the massive search area provided hope for survivors, though their origin was not clear. The underwater sounds detected by sonar devices on Tuesday first came every 30 minutes and were heard again four hours later, according to an internal US government memo update on the search. Naval experts were analyzing recordings of the sounds to determine their origin. I cant tell you what the noises are, Frederick said. If indeed there are survivors, the crew would have limited rations of food and water in the 21-foot submersible, which has rudimentary controls and no room for passengers to stretch out, officials have said. We need a miracle, oceanographer and water search expert David Gallo told CNN on Wednesday. But miracles do happen. The number of assets in the search operation is expected to double in the next day or two, Frederick said Wednesday. A Canadian Coast Guard boat with sonar capabilities, the John Cabot, arrived Wednesday, and the US Navy is sending a lift system that can pull heavy objects up from 20,000 feet deep to help if the submersible is found. The Coast Guard has done a very good job in putting the right tools with the right team in the right spot. So, the chances are as good as they can be, Gallo, the senior adviser for strategic initiatives at RMS Titanic Inc., told CNN on Thursday morning. Its tough because the oceans are pitch black, you can only use sound to image effectively, and youve got to be pretty much on top of the object to actually see it, he added. Environmental factors in the ocean are likely complicating efforts to identify the noises, said Rick Murcar, the international training director for the National Association of Cave Divers. Currents can deflect the sound so it appears its coming from miles away from its source, Murcar explained, likening the effort to locate the noise to trying to pinpoint a snare drum in a stadium full of cheering fans and other instruments. If the submersible is found at depth, it would take a while to bring it to the surface, and there wont be a way to get oxygen into it, said ocean explorer Tom Dettweiler, who was part of the expedition that discovered the Titanic wreckage in 1985. The thing to do would be to bring it up as quickly as possible and open the hatch and get to the people. Unfortunately, it cannot be brought up all that quickly when it is on the end of a cable and dependent on the speed of a winch to bring it up, he told CNN. Youre still talking about hours, potentially, to get it up. Harsh conditions on the submersible As aircraft, ships, sonar buoys and robots comb through the ocean, experts warn conditions are likely dire aboard the 23,000-pound submersible  especially if its still deep underwater. Ret. Navy Capt. David Marquet, a former submarine captain, described Wednesday what he imagines the five passengers are experiencing in the Titan beyond hunger, thirst and discomfort. Theyre freezing cold. The water entirely surrounding the ship is at freezing or slightly below. When they exhale, their breath condenses. Theres frost on the inside of the parts of the submarine, Marquet told CNNs Jake Tapper. Theyre all huddled together trying to conserve their body heat. Theyre running low on oxygen and theyre exhaling carbon dioxide. The submersible has a limited ability to absorb the exhaled carbon dioxide, which at high levels could trigger headaches, confusion and nausea, Marquet said. The oxygen and the carbon dioxide and the freezing are what they got to hold onto as long as possible to give the rescuers the time they need. Those onboard will need to conserve energy, said Joe MacInnis, a physician and renowned diver whos made two trips to the Titanic wreck. Resting, breathing as little as possible, and trying to keep calm  that is the most important thing, he told CNN early Wednesday. Per Wimmer, an adventurer and acquaintance of Harding and Rush, said he believed they would know to conserve oxygen. I still have hope, Wimmer said on CNN This Morning. I remain optimistic, positive, and hoping for a miracle here, at least until its proven otherwise. The last communication between the vessel and its mother ship, the Polar Prince, came in at 11:47 a.m. Sunday. With no GPS underwater, the submersible is only guided by text messages from the surface ship. Indeed, issues with computer control were among the reasons Discovery Channels Expedition Unknown host Josh Gates and his team decided after a 2021 test dive of Titan against filming a segment on the vessel as it became clear to us at that time that there was a lot that needed to be worked out with the sub, he said. A lot of the systems worked but a lot of them really didnt. We had issues with thrusters and issues with computer control and things like that. Ultimately, it was a challenging dive, Gates told CNNs Anderson Cooper Wednesday. We were inside Titan for two or three hours, and there were a lot of things that werent really ready for prime time, it seemed, he said, adding he couldnt get comfortable with the Titan at that time. OceanGate declined safety review of Titan submersible, industry leader says The disappearance of Titan and the international dash to find it have put its operator under the microscope. At least two former OceanGate employees years ago expressed safety concerns about the vessels hull, including the thickness of the material used and testing procedures, CNN has learned. The 23,000-pound craft is made of highly engineered carbon fiber and titanium. OceanGate Expeditions strayed from industry norms by declining a voluntary, rigorous safety review of the vessel, according to an industry leader. If the company had pursued a certification review some of this may have been avoided, Will Kohnen of the Marine Technology Society told CNN on Wednesday. The company also faced a series of mechanical problems and inclement weather conditions that forced the cancellation or delays of trips in recent years, according to court records. The scuttled excursions led to a pair of lawsuits in which some high-paying customers sought to recoup the cost of trips they said they didnt take. The complaints alleged that the company overstated its ability to reach the Titanic wreckage. OceanGate did not respond to the claims in court and could not be reached for comment. Some expeditions were delayed after OceanGate was forced to rebuild the Titans hull because it showed cyclic fatigue and wouldnt be able to travel deep enough to reach the Titanics wreckage, according to a 2020 article by GeekWire, which interviewed the companys CEO.

        "title": "Biden welcomes Modi with White House pomp, GE seals India deal",
        "date": "June 22, 2023 10:26 pm",
        "content": "President Joe Biden rolled out the White House red carpet for Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday as part of his effort to jump-start a stronger U.S.-India relationship and counter Chinas global influence with a series of defense and trade agreements. Biden treated Modi to a colorful White House South Lawn arrival ceremony before some 7,000 people in the morning, before the leaders gathered for Oval Office talks ahead of a glittering state dinner in the evening. The challenges and opportunities facing the world in this century require that India and the United States work and lead together, and we are, Biden said during the ceremony. Washington wants India to be a strategic counterweight to China and sees India as a critical partnership, although some analysts and former officials question Indias willingness to stand up collectively to Beijing over issues such as Taiwan. Washington has also been frustrated by Indias close ties with Russia amid Moscows war in Ukraine. Modi is seeking to raise the influence that India, the worlds most populous country at 1.4 billion, has on the world stage in the wake of strained ties with neighboring China. This grand welcome ceremony at the White House today is an honor and pride for the 1.4 billion people of India, Modi said, speaking mostly in Hindi. This is also an honor for more than 4 million people of Indian origin living in the U.S. For this honor, I express my heartfelt gratitude. Both leaders noted that their countrys constitution started with the same three words, We, the people. The festival-like opening ceremony featured violinist Vibha Janakiraman and a cappella group Penn Masala performing renditions of songs by the American group Maroon 5 as well as from movies featuring Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan. In a rare gesture, Modi has agreed to take questions from reporters with Biden at the White House on Thursday. Modi has not conducted a news conference since becoming prime minister nine years ago and his visit has drawn attention to concerns over human rights in India. Biden said in the Oval Office before their private conversation that the two countries relationship needed to be one grounded on democracy, human rights, freedom and rule of law. Modi, reading from prepared remarks, said all eyes were on the worlds two largest democracies. NEW US INDIA DEALS Biden administration officials say sweeping agreements to be announced on semiconductors, critical minerals, technology, space cooperation and defense cooperation and sales will ring in a new era in relations between the two countries. Some are aimed at diversifying supply chains to reduce dependence on China. The United States has also sought to address Chinas rising influence in the Indo-Pacific region by bolstering defense ties with countries like India and Australia. Biden and Modi will sign off on what one official called a trailblazing deal to allow General Electric (GE.N) to produce jet engines in India to power Indian military aircraft, through a memorandum of understanding with Hindustan Aeronautics (HIAE.NS) to produce the engines. U.S. Navy ships in the region will be able to stop in Indian shipyards for repairs under a maritime agreement, and India will procure U.S.-made armed MQ-9B SeaGuardian drones. U.S. chipmaker Micron Technologys (MU.O) 2.7 billion plans a new semiconductor testing and packaging unit, to be built in Modis home state of Gujarat. The U.S. will also make it easier for skilled Indian workers to get and renew U.S. visas. India also agreed to join the U.S.-led Artemis Accords on space exploration and to work with NASA on a joint mission to the International Space Station in 2024. PROGRESSIVE U.S. CONGRESS MEMBERS TO BOYCOTT The flurry of agreements comes as some lawmakers have raised serious concerns about democratic backsliding in India. Biden has been under pressure from his fellow Democrats to discuss human rights with Modi. Three progressive Democrats - U.S. Representatives Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib - have said they would boycott Modis address to Congress on Thursday. I encourage my colleagues who stand for pluralism, tolerance and freedom of the press to join me in doing the same, Ocasio-Cortez said in a Twitter post on Wednesday. A U.S. official who briefed reporters said Biden would bring up concerns about press freedoms, religious freedoms and other issues in a respectful way without hectoring, lecturing or scolding. Meanwhile, Republican U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Kevin McCarthy told reporters he and the chambers Democratic leader, Hakeem Jeffries, would lead a bipartisan congressional delegation to India in October, Jeffries said he had not committed to such a trip. Modi has been to the United States five times since becoming prime minister in 2014, but the trip will be his first with the full diplomatic status of a state visit. The two leaders held a private, intimate dinner at the White House on Wednesday night. Biden and his wife Jill were set to give Modi gifts including a vintage American camera, a print of George Eastmans patent of the first Kodak camera, a book of American wildlife photography and a signed first edition of Robert Frost poems. Modi will address U.S. CEOs at a reception on Friday, as American companies plan new investments in India. Source - Reuters - Agencies",

        "title": "President confident of achieving substantial headway by 2024, outlines plans to finalize debt restructuring",
        "date": "June 22, 2023 10:33 pm",
        "content": "In a determined push to address Sri Lankas debt crisis and foster reconciliation, President Ranil Wickremesinghe outlined his plans to finalize the debt restructuring process by September. Participating in the 40th anniversary event of the International Democrat Union (IDU) in London, Wickremesinghe expressed his aims to develop a comprehensive strategy for resolving the nations financial burdens in close collaboration with the Parliament. The event took place on 19 and 20 June, with Wickremesinghe being joined by former Canadian Prime Minister (Conservative Party) Chairman of the IDU, Stephen Harper. While debt restructuring remains a key priority, President Wickremesinghe noted that his primary focus lies in completing vital structural reforms, aiming to accelerate economic liberalization and attract increased investments, which are intended to bolster Sri Lankas financial prospects and drive a more favourable balance of trade in the long term. Amidst questions regarding the duration of the process, Wickremesinghe expressed confidence that substantial headway will be achieved by 2024. Furthermore, he said that efforts have been made to address land-related concerns in the North and East regions, with progress being made on settling these disputes. The Missing Persons Office has taken steps towards utilization and has yielded potential solutions, which have been shared with Tamil parties. Following are excerpts from the interview: President Ranil Wickremesinghe; If I look back to May-June last year, Sri Lanka was on the verge of chaos. No one seemed willing to take charge or show leadership. I found myself in a peculiar position. In the 2019 Presidential Election, our party wanted to adopt a populist approach, so they chose our deputy leader as their candidate. Unfortunately, as I had anticipated, he suffered a significant defeat. Then the COVID pandemic struck, and in August 2020, we went ahead with the election. Personally, I believed that we should stick with the IMF program. This program, which we had initiated in 2016, required Sri Lanka to commit to a primary surplus and reduce subsidies. We diligently worked towards these goals, and by 2018, we managed to achieve a primary surplus of USD 300 million. While it was a modest amount, it gave us a starting point to build upon. However, the new government that came into power subsequently decided to cancel the IMF agreement. It was at that point that I advocated for revisiting the IMF and requesting them to reinstate the agreement. Furthermore, I suggested that we explore other options to raise USD 5 million. During my tenure as Prime Minister, I had engaged in negotiations with the Japanese, Indians, and other parties for projects worth approximately USD 4 billion. Unfortunately, all those projects were ultimately cancelled. Despite this setback, some members of my own party believed that our approach was too narrow and opted for a populist stance, eventually breaking away from the party. As a result, for the first time in history, my party was left with just one member in parliament, which happened to be me. Meanwhile, the breakaway faction had gathered 50 members. On May 9 of the previous year, riots erupted, leading to the burning of the residences of 65 government members of parliament. Consequently, the Prime Minister at the time, Mr. Mahinda Rajapaksa, was compelled to resign. That night, I engaged in discussions with a government member to explore how I could be of assistance. The following day, the President reached out to the leader of the opposition and the leader of the breakaway faction, asking them to assume the position of Prime Minister. However, the leader of the breakaway faction declined the offer. During this period, I had been advising the President to seek assistance from the IMF and the World Bank. Subsequently, the government insisted that I should become Prime Minister and nominated me for the position with their support. I expressed my concern about being the only member of the party and questioned the feasibility of having a Prime Minister under such circumstances. However, they reassured me that they would support me and initiated negotiations with the IMF. In the previous year, our debt services amounted to approximately 8 billion. By April 2022, our financial situation had deteriorated to the point where we had to declare ourselves bankrupt. However, as we began to recover and the government started functioning, a wave of protests emerged. On July 9, a group of organizers managed to gather a significant number of people in Colombo, something unprecedented in scale. Shockingly, these protesters went on to invade the official residence of the President. Faced with this unexpected threat, the President had to flee to the harbour and board a ship belonging to the Sri Lankan Navy. Later that afternoon, party leaders convened a meeting, during which they demanded the Presidents resignation and proposed that I assume the role of acting President. However, the opposition insisted that I should also resign. I stood firm and reminded them that according to the constitution, a person with a majority vote in parliament must be found before I could resign. Meanwhile, urged by some media outlets, the protesters targeted my house and set it on fire, assuming I would be compelled to leave. However, I remained steadfast and refused to back down. The following day, I was asked to resign, while some others advocated for the Speaker to take over. However, both propositions were rejected. I maintained my position and refused to resign. On Monday, with the cabinet assembled, we held a televised meeting, while the President had already left the country for the Maldives. Meanwhile, the protesters resolved to seize the Prime Ministers office and take control of Parliament. Two days later, a fierce battle ensued outside the Prime Ministers office, lasting approximately six to five hours. Despite the escalating situation, I refrained from ordering the use of firearms. Eventually, the protesters managed to break into the Prime Ministers office, with the military accompanying them. In the afternoon, they began marching towards Parliament. Recognizing the gravity of the situation, I instructed the Chief of Defence to issue a statement, emphasizing that the protesters must not take over Parliament. The opposition leader supported this stance. I then directed the army commander, reminding him of his responsibility to protect the parliamentary building. I stressed that we could deploy the best battalion in Sri Lanka, even without arms, to confront the protesters. Remarkably, the unarmed battalion successfully managed to quell the protests, but unfortunately, 24 soldiers were injured in the process. At that moment, I realized that it was time for me to step in and assume control. The President had already submitted his resignation, yet nobody was willing to allow me to be sworn in as the acting president within any official buildings. I made a conscious decision not to utilize Parliament or the Chief Justices residence, nor any of the other buildings occupied by ministers. Instead, I had to resort to a family temple near my house. Early in the morning, I went to the temple, accompanied by the Chief Justice, where I took my oath of office. In order to maintain secrecy, the priest requested that the location of the temple not be disclosed. There was a photograph capturing the moment I was being sworn in, but the temples whereabouts remained unknown. Soon after, we had to proceed with the presidential election. In the meantime, I took necessary steps to restore law and order. I firmly stated that these were not mere protests, but actions intended to overthrow the government and disrupt the Sri Lankan parliament. I had a responsibility to put an end to it. Although a number of protesters were initially arrested, they were later released, which only served to embolden them further. Even the presidents of the Bar Association stood in solidarity with them. Recognizing the gravity of the situation, I consulted with the Attorney General and realized that the protesters were attempting to attack Parliament. As a result, I issued detention orders and apprehended two or three individuals. It was the only viable approach to address the escalating crisis. Eventually, the Prime Ministers office was cleared as the army intervened, followed by the clearance of the Presidents office and residence. When it came time for the election, the circumstances were quite peculiar. On one side, there was the government party led by the Rajapaksa clan, whom we were opposed to, and on the other side, there was the opposition. Surprisingly, I discovered that I had support from both the government party and the opposition, and they urged me to contest the election. Responding to their call, I entered the race and emerged victorious, winning by a margin of 135 votes. Once I assumed the presidency of Sri Lanka, I promptly issued an order prohibiting any form of demonstrations in the country for one week, aiming to restore peace and stability. As a result of these efforts, we successfully managed to restore order. We reached out to the large number of individuals who were attempting to disrupt peace and sent them a message, urging them to support the government in its endeavour to re-establish law and order. The silent majority, including businesses and individuals in the villages, stood behind this cause, even if they may not have specifically supported me personally. Their support was for the restoration of law and orders itself. Having achieved stability, I proceeded to take additional measures to address the prevailing economic crisis. One of our key decisions was to initiate negotiations with the International Monetary Fund (IMF). I plan to finalize the debt restructuring after September. As I move forward, I will be working on Sri Lankas debt restructuring strategy with the parliament. However, my main focus is on completing the necessary structural reforms. I aim to promptly liberalize the economy and attract more investments to Sri Lanka. In the long run, it is crucial to have investments that will improve the balance of trade in our favour. So, why should this process take so much time? Nonetheless, I am confident that by 2024, we will have much greater control over the situation. Mr Stephan Harper And ultimately, what youre conveying is, I believe, a message that applies to all of us. While the economic problems may vary in severity across our countries, challenges still exist. The only viable solution in the long run is a program driven by the private sector. President Wickremesinghe A market-oriented, credit-integrated growth strategy is the only available option. I genuinely believe there is no other solution, and this has been the case for thousands of years. Mr Stephen Harper Well, Winston Churchill famously remarked that all forms of government are dreadful, except for democracy. We observe that societies often experiment with socialism, protectionism, corporatism and populism until they ultimately realize that conservatism is the only path to economic growth. However, lets shift gears because a significant portion of our discussion revolves around global affairs and foreign policy. While we represent a diverse group here, it is evident that we predominantly represent the Global North, whereas you hail from the Global South. Considering your geographical position, where do you envision Sri Lankas future foreign focus? Which countries serve as its strategic allies, and what risks do you anticipate in the upcoming phase? President Wickremesinghe Sri Lankas primary strategic allies in Asia are the Southern Asian region. Additionally, we maintain relationships with the Middle East, India, Japan, China, and Australia. Looking westward, we engage with Europe, the United Kingdom, Commonwealth countries, and South Africa. Mr Stephen Harper In a world where trade pressures, the on-going COVID pandemic, and especially the conflict in Ukraine, have contributed to a growing polarization or tension between the United States and its allies on one side, and China and its allies on the other, how does a country in your position, in terms of economic growth, position itself? Where do you see Sri Lanka fitting into this scenario, and how do you navigate the complexities that arise from such dynamics? President Wickremesinghe Essentially, our stance aligns with the Global South, and we emphasize sharing that perspective. Both the United States and China are crucial partners for us. Their involvements in the Pacific region and the Belt and Road Initiative, along with the ASEAN outlook on the Indo-Pacific, are all compatible. The rise of China has contributed to the rise of Asia, so it is vital for us to ensure Chinas continued economic development. However, that alone is insufficient for our region. We also need ASEAN, India, and the Middle East to witness growth over the next 20 to 25 years. While we have managed to strike a balance by leveraging relationships with various countries, we also value our association with the United States. Sri Lankas foreign policy has consistently aimed to prevent the militarization of the Indian region, yet we have supported the United States from the very beginning. Currently, we are urging everyone to collaborate with us in Sri Lanka to assume the chairmanship of IORA (Indian Ocean Rim Association) to safeguard freedom of navigation in the Indian Ocean. Simultaneously, we advocate for freedom of navigation in the Pacific. The three main issues need to be addressed collectively rather than one dominating over the other. China must engage in constructive dialogue with African countries to resolve these matters and reduce tensions. Mr Stephen Harper Id like to delve deeper into the China question. It is often emphasized that the United States is essential for our security while Chinas support is critical for our economy. We have to navigate both relationships, and undoubtedly, Chinese investments and business have played a significant role in Sri Lanka. However, Ive noticed substantial issues regarding the debt obligations left by China. Could you provide some insight into this matter? President Wickremesinghe China holds the position of being both the largest bilateral creditor and the largest debtor as a private investor. Initially, China was unsure about how to approach the debt restructuring. They took time, while the United States offered assistance, followed by Japan and India with a combined amount of 3.5 billion. We utilized approximately 2.5 billion, and the United States also provided support. This marked the beginning of our progress. We engaged with the Paris Club, excluding India and China initially, but later India joined. Meanwhile, we were engaged in discussions with China, which were complicated due to their party conference in November. Eventually, they decided to stand by us. Then, in Sri Lanka, we proposed the Common Platform and suggested India join the platform while China attended as an observer. They expressed their willingness to engage in bilateral discussions with us, but their primary focus seems to be on bilateral discussions with the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The IMF ensures all parties are informed and involved. Currently, we are working on the platform for creditors and engaging with China, but I cannot predict how this will work out with other debtor nations. Mr Stephen Harper I have two more questions, but we are running a bit behind schedule. However, I must ask you about an important point of discussion here, considering your unique perspective from the Global South. Your country has significant trade relations with both Ukraine and Russia. Could you elaborate on how you envision the desired outcome in this context? President Wickremesinghe When it comes to the majority of the Global South, we have chosen to stay out of this conflict. Some countries within ASEAN have taken positions, with some working actively, while others remain neutral. A few have voted in favour of the revolution. From the beginning, it has been our belief that this issue could have been resolved through peaceful means. Our primary goal is to prevent the conflict from escalating and to ensure a peaceful settlement. As someone mentioned before, history has shown that major wars often originate in Europe. Our commitment lies in supporting a peaceful resolution in Ukraine. The question remains about how we can achieve this and bring Russia to the negotiating table. President Ramaphosa has led a delegation to both Russia and Ukraine in an effort to facilitate dialogue. However, we have yet to witness the conclusion of these negotiations, which will undoubtedly require time. The conflict has had significant repercussions on countries affected by disruptions in fuel and food supplies. Mr Stephen Harper Under your predecessors regime, you have talked about war, you had civil war in Sri Lanka, and we all know how the predecessors regime ended. Given all the challenges, how do you promote reconciliation between the Tamil community and the country as a whole? President Wickremesinghe When I was the Prime Minister, I started the process, so I am continuing from where I have ended. I am speaking with the members of Parliament representing the Tamil areas and we have come to agreements on many issues. On the truth and reconciliation commission, the legislation have been drafted. On the new anti-terrorist law has been presented to the Parliament. There were three major issues difference between the government and opposition two of which have been resolved. The third one finally has been resolved by court as to what the definition of terrorism is. They were looking for my views, I said let the court decide and we will go along with whatever the court says. There was a question of lands being inquiring from the Tamils in the North and East. The land issue is been settled and the missing persons office is taking step to resolve the issue. We have gone through half of the issues and come up with the solutions which I have given to the Tamil parties.",

        "date": "June 23, 2023 01:55 am",
        "content": "The five people who died on the Titan submersible were true explorers, the company who operated the dive said. The men shared a distinct spirit of adventure, OceanGate said in a statement, The five men died in what the the Coast Guard believes was a catastrophic implosion. It said that debris was discovered near the wreck of the Titanic earlier on Thursday morning. The vessel disappeared on Sunday. The men on board the sub included Stockton Rush, the 61-year-old CEO of OceanGate, as well as British-Pakistani businessman Shahzada Dawood, 48, his son Suleman, 19, and British businessman Hamish Harding, 58. The fifth man on board, Paul-Henry Nargeolet, was a 77-year-old former French navy diver and renowned explorer. At a news conference on Thursday, Rear Adm John Mauger of the US Coast Guard said that the debris is believed to be consistent with the Titan submersible. It is unclear what led to the destruction of the Titan. The disappearance of the vessel led to a massive international search effort involving US, Canadian, British and French forces. In a statement, OceanGate said it appreciated their commitment to finding these five explorers, and their days and nights of tireless work in support of our crew and their families. The debris was located by a remote-controlled underwater search vehicle (ROV) about 1,600 feet (480m) from the wreckage of the Titanic. Five separate pieces were discovered that allowed authorities to confirm they came from the Titan, including a tail cone. It is unclear when the implosion occurred or what may have caused it. Rear Adm Mauger said he did not have an answer on whether the bodies of the five men on-board were likely to be recovered. This is an incredibly unforgiving environment down there on the seafloor, he said. ROVs will remain in the area as the investigation into what happened continues, Rear Adm Mauger added. Other personnel - including medical experts and technicians - will begin demobilising. Earlier this week, authorities said that Canadian aircraft had detected underwater sounds, which some experts speculated may have been a sign that the subs passengers were still alive. The Coast Guard now believes there was no connection between the noises and the location in which the Titans debris was found on the sea floor. Source - BBC - Agencies",

        "date": "June 23, 2023 11:10 am",
        "content": "Infant mortality rises and life expectancy falls when sovereign debt defaults are not quickly resolved, a study said on Wednesday, as negotiations to restructure the debts of countries including Zambia, Sri Lanka and Ghana drag on. In countries that have come out of default within three years since 1900, infant deaths were 2.2 percentage points higher than if they had not defaulted, according to the study by researchers Clemens Graf von Luckner and Juan Farah-Yacoub. In defaults that dragged on for more than three years, and lasted for an average of a decade, infant mortality was 11.4 percentage points higher, they found. Life expectancy was 1.5 percentage points lower, on average, a decade after a default, with the figure worsening for longer instances. The COVID-19 pandemic tipped a number of countries including Zambia into default, while rising global interest rates and inflation fuelled by Russias invasion of Ukraine pushed others over the edge. In response to the pandemic in 2020, G20 nations launched the Common Framework restructuring process. It has been used by Zambia, Ethiopia, Chad and Ghana but has yet to secure a resounding success, with China and multiple commercial creditors complicating negotiations. The outstanding issues on Zambia are entirely political, its entirely about the Chinese and the U.S. putting aside other differences and getting this done, said Mark Malloch Brown, president of the Open Society Foundations, which published the study. Its the fault of a wider system of big powers rarely having the uninterrupted commitment and prioritisation to get a small countrys debt problem dealt with when theyve both got significant interests and face at stake. Zambias bilateral creditors expect to make a debt restructuring proposal this week to the southern African country, an official with the Paris Club, which coordinates developed creditor nations, told Reuters on Monday.

        "date": "June 23, 2023 03:55 pm",
        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe, attending a high-level panel discussion at the Global Leaders Summit for a New Global Financing Pact, in Paris on Thursday (June 22), discussed Sri Lankas experience with debt restructuring and the need for a comprehensive approach to address the challenges faced by middle-income nations. He said Sri Lanka faced limited access to financing and took ownership of its debt and economic restructuring program. Wickremesinghe emphasized the need for timely and automatic access to concessional financing and highlighted the high costs incurred during the process. He also called for improved interaction between creditors and debtors and suggests a new approach to address geopolitical issues. Further, Wickremesinghe emphasized the urgency of restructuring to avoid instability and advocated for a separate process for middle-income countries to address their unique challenges. He expressed gratitude for the IMFs intervention and Sri Lankas coordination, which allowed dealing with both creditor groups, adding that ongoing negotiations with Japan, India, and China regarding trade integration and development programs also aided the process. However, President Wickremesinghe highlights the need for improved interaction between the committee and debtors during the restructuring process, suggesting that a new approach is necessary. Following is an excerpt of the question posed by the moderator, First Deputy Prime Minister of Spain Nadia Calvino at the panel discussion and the response by President Wickremesinghe; Q: So President Wickremesinghe, you are in a somewhat special situation. We move now into a middle-income country. The coordination challenges are maybe, greater in the sense that you are not subject to the common framework, which is heard that it was an important instrument in the case of Chad. The official creditor committee has been formed with Paris Club and non-Paris Club members and we understand that Indias decision to participate and co-chair these creditors gathering is a major milestone. So what is your view about the restructuring process and what do you consider to be the main bottlenecks? We have already heard from the President of Chad that we need to reduce bureaucracy and we all agree on that. Simplification is sometimes the most complex thing to achieve. But, we are very interested to hear your experience in this regard. A: When Sri Lanka was declared bankrupt as a middle-income country, we were not eligible under the common framework for debt restructuring. We had limited access to concessionary financing and there was a complete loss of external financing. Therefore, Sri Lankas response was to take ownership of this program, both for debt restructuring as well as the economic restructuring needed for growth. Then we negotiated our conditionality with the IMF and the creditors. So, its like we were working on a menu, the argument of what are the items that should get on and what are the items that could be taken off. I think we had an agreement actually to about 90 of the items. So, we own it as much as the IMF is. Of course, we had two exceptional situations. One is that India came to our help and that was nearly four billion US dollars available when no other source of funding was available. Secondly, through the World Bank and the ADB, we went through the process of reverse graduation. So the gain became entitled to concessionary funding. But from the time we declared ourselves bankrupt, there was a delay in bureaucracy on both sides. We delayed and if we had funding by May, the upheavals of July could have been avoided. But anyway, we had the upheavals of July. We went in immediately as it settled down. By September, we had a staff-level agreement, but it took us another six months for the agreement to come before we got any monetary assistance. So, we undertook significant economic reform that imposed pain on the population but without any predictability. Now, this is the problem we have. I would say given the increasing vulnerabilities facing middle-income nations, MICs access to concessional financing must be viewed from a broader perspective. That is access to an automatic and timely, under an agreed criterion. If you fulfill the criteria. Secondly, I mean, I agree President Acharya defined it. We could have done it much faster. We did the debt. The staff level agreement came last September. By November, we had the climate prosperity plan, which we announced at COP 27. Now, its been followed up by Sri Lankas growth agenda for a highly competitive green economy. So our financial needs, both official and private, have virtually quadrupled. So thats problem others also have to face. Then I would say following the conclusion of the negotiations with the IMF and the successful approval of the Extended Fund Facility (EFF), we have had no roadmap to follow regarding the next phase of debt restructuring. So, before we can get the next tranche from the IMF. So its a question of us now mapping the road out. But I would like to certainly point out a few of the experiences. The data-led approach was the key to our success. It was our program, not an IMF program. Secondly, we found a sponsor for us among the official creditor community. That helps. Thirdly, you have to be very pragmatic when you are implementing this. Im not sure that a binding framework like the common framework would have rendered the process quicker or more efficient. The approach for a middle-income country would be to move. If you have a common framework, what happens is we move as fast as the slowest creditor. So we get tied down. So thats why we are not in favor of a common framework. We were able to create traction with the most committed creditors, raising the general quality and efficiency of the process, because we are still frustrated by the lack of process. The cost for us, economic and social, has been very high. Now, as far as the creditors, our creditors include the Paris Club and the non-Paris Club members of which India and China are two of our main creditors, and Japan from the Paris Club. So weve attempted to establish an ad hoc platform for the official creditors, including the Paris Club members and others. India, Hungary, and others came on to participate in the ad hoc platform. China participated as an observer. We shared the information with all parties on an open transaction, a transparent process. Then I must thank IMF for the intervention of the IMF and Sri Lankas coordination, we are dealing with both groups. So what else helped us was that Sri Lanka had ongoing negotiations with Japan, India, and China separately regarding further trade integration and also some of the development programs for the future. This assisted our process. But as far as my experience is, we need, we have to have some improvement in the interaction between the committee and the debtors because the debt restructuring process is a negotiation and it should in essence be interactive. Looking at the dealing with the Paris Club and non-Paris Club, we need a new approach because this is basically a geopolitical issue. The mistrust between the US and China and the growing tension, it has to be addressed by all, not merely by Sri Lanka or the country concerned. If you do not resolve it, I think we will still, in Asia and Africa, we will get caught into another situation, not our making. So these will be the major issues that we have addressed. And restructuring is needed. I agree with it. It has to move fast, otherwise, most countries, whether low-income countries or middle-income countries, will not have much hope and there will be more instability, political and economic instability. And without creating a separate process under this roundtable, we should deal with the issues of middle-income countries because most are under stress. Its better to deal with them under stress than when they are bankrupt. So that process has to evolve. -PMD",

        "content": "The main suspect and the young couple arrested in connection with the death of a 16-year-old schoolgirl in Kalutara last month have been further remanded. Accordingly, the three accused were further remanded until 07 July, after being produced before the Kalutara Magistrates Court today (23 June). On 06 May, the naked corpse of a 16-year-old girl was found near the railway tracks in Kalutara, after she reportedly fell to her death from the third floor of a five-storey hotel in the area. Danushka Gayan Sahabandu, a 29-year-old resident of Isuru Uyana in Kalutara, was arrested on 09 May, three days after the teens body was recovered. A young couple, aged 19 and 22, who had accompanied the girl and the main suspect too were later arrested, along with another individual, identified as the driver of the car in which the group travelled. Meanwhile, the wife of the hotel owner was placed under arrest on May 11 on account of failing to properly check the deceaseds National Identity Card (NIC) before accommodating her at the said hotel. Initial probes had revealed that the NIC produced by the 16-year-old girl to rent a room at the hotel belongs to one of her friends. During preliminary interrogations, the main suspect denied murder accusations levelled against him. He told the police that the girl had, in fact, jumped off the hotel building after receiving a phone call. He also revealed that he visited the hotel on May 06 with the young couple in question, and the 16-year-old after renting two rooms on the third floor of the hotel. He had also admitted to consuming alcohol with them. The main suspect had also mentioned that he was not acquainted with the schoolgirl prior to their meeting on that fateful day and that he was introduced to her by the 22-year-old youth. The main suspects driver was released on two surety bails of Rs. 500,000 each on 09 June, while a foreign travel ban was also imposed on him until the hearing of the case is concluded. While barring him from exerting pressure on the witnesses in the case, the chief magistrate also ordered him to report to the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) on the last Sunday of every month between 9 a.m. and 12 p.m.",

        "title": "Titanic director James Cameron points to flaws in Titan submersibles design",
        "date": "June 23, 2023 11:00 pm",
        "content": "Weve never had an accident like this, James Cameron, the Oscar-winning director of Titanic, said on Thursday. Mr. Cameron, an expert in submersibles, has dived dozens of times to the ships deteriorating hulk and once plunged in a tiny craft of his own design to the bottom of the planets deepest recess. In an interview, Mr. Cameron called the presumed loss of five lives aboard the Titan submersible from the company OceanGate like nothing anyone involved in private ocean exploration had ever seen. Thereve never been fatalities at this kind of depth and certainly no implosions, he said. An implosion in the deep sea happens when the crushing pressures of the abyss cause a hollow object to collapse violently inward. If the object is big enough to hold five people, Mr. Cameron said in an interview, its going to be an extremely violent event  like 10 cases of dynamite going off. In 2012, Mr. Cameron designed and piloted an experimental submersible into a region in the Pacific Ocean called the Challenger Deep. Mr. Cameron had not sought certification of the vessels safety by organizations in the maritime industry that provide such services to numerous companies. We did that knowingly because the craft was experimental and its mission scientific, Mr. Cameron said. I would never design a vehicle to take passengers and not have it certified. Mr. Cameron strongly criticized Stockton Rush, the OceanGate chief executive who piloted the submersible when it disappeared Sunday, for never getting his tourist submersible certified as safe. He noted that Mr. Rush called certification an impediment to innovation. I agree in principle, Mr. Cameron said. But you cant take that stance when youre putting paying customers into your submersible  when you have innocent guests who trust you and your statements about vehicle safety. As a design weakness in the Titan submersible and a possible cautionary sign to its passengers, Mr. Cameron cited its construction with carbon-fiber composites. The materials are used widely in the aerospace industry because they weigh much less than steel or aluminum, yet pound for pound are stronger and stiffer. The problem, Mr. Cameron said, is that a carbon-fiber composite has no strength in compression which happens as an undersea vehicle plunges ever deeper into the abyss and faces soaring increases in water pressure. Its not what its designed for. The company, he added, used sensors in the hull of the Titan to assess the status of the carbon-fiber composite hull. In its promotional material, OceanGate pointed to the sensors as an innovative feature for hull health monitoring. Early this year, an academic expert described the system as providing the pilot with enough time to arrest the descent and safely return to surface. In contrast to the company, Mr. Cameron called it a warning system to let the submersibles pilot know if the hull is getting ready to implode. Mr. Cameron said the sensor network on the subs hull was an inadequate solution to a design he saw as intrinsically flawed. Its not like a light coming on when the oil in your car is low, he said of the network of hull sensors. This is different. Source: The New York Times -Agencies",

        "date": "June 24, 2023 12:50 pm",
        "content": "The head of Russias Wagner mercenary group has vowed to go all the way to topple Russias military leadership, hours after the Kremlin accused him of armed rebellion. Yevgeny Prigozhin said his Wagner fighters had crossed the border from Ukraine into Russia, entering the city of Rostov-on-Don. Mr Prigozhin said his men would destroy anyone who stood in their way. The local governor urged citizens there to keep calm and stay indoors. Mr Prigozhin claimed that his forces had shot down a Russian military helicopter that opened fire on a civilian convoy. He did not give a location and the assertion could not be immediately verified. The Wagner Group is a private army of mercenaries that has been fighting alongside the regular Russian army in Ukraine. Tension has been growing between them over how the war has been fought, with Mr Prigozhin launching vocal criticisms of Russias military leadership in recent months. On Friday, the 62-year-old mercenary leader accused the military of launching a deadly missile strike on his troops and vowed to punish them. He did not provide evidence. Authorities have denied the strike and demanded he halt his illegal actions. Mr Prigozhin said the evil in Russias military leadership must be stopped and vowed to march for justice. Those who killed our lads, and tens of thousands of lives of Russian soldiers in the war in Ukraine will be punished, he said in an audio message posted to the social media platform Telegram. I ask you not to resist. Anyone who does will be considered a threat and destroyed. That goes for any checkpoints and aviation on our way. Presidential power, the government, the police and Russian guard will work as usual. This is not a military coup, but a march of justice. Our actions do not interfere with the troops in any way. Russias President Vladimir Putin is receiving round-the-clock updates on the situation, his spokesman said. Security in Moscow was stepped up on Friday night at prime locations in Moscow, including government buildings and transport facilities, Russias state-owned news agency TASS said. The governor of Russias Lipetsk region is also asking residents not to travel south. Lipetsk is around 280km (175 miles) north-east of the nearest Ukrainian border, and more than 500km north of Rostov. Writing on Telegram, Igor Artamonov said security measures in the region are being tightened, with a particular focus on protecting critical infrastructure facilities. In a tweet late on Friday, the Ukrainian Ministry of Defence said simply: We are watching. The White House said it was monitoring the situation and would consult with US allies. Gen Sergei Surovikin, the deputy head of the Russian forces in Ukraine, whose leadership Mr Prigozhin has praised in the past, called on him to stop the convoys and return them to their bases. We are of one blood, we are warriors, he said in a video. You mustnt play into the enemys hands at a time that is difficult for our country. Another senior commander, Lt Gen Vladimir Alekseyev, described the Wagner chiefs actions as a stab in the back of the country and the president. Source: BBC -Agencies",

At the SOC meeting on Friday (June 22), the committees chairman MP Mahindananda Aluthgamage inquired into the annual revenue and the performances of the Excise Department. Aluthgamage told the Excise Departments officials that the expected revenue from the Excise Department this year is Rs. 217 billion, however, as of June, only Rs. 72.985 billion have been earned. He said that due to this, the Excise Department of Sri Lanka has not reached the expected income.

        "date": "June 24, 2023 06:50 pm",
        "content": "President Vladimir Putin warned Saturday that treason against his rule threatens Russia with civil war, as Moscows military launched an operation to tackle a revolt by the Wagner mercenary group. The rapidly escalating events mark the most serious challenge yet to the Kremlin chiefs long rule, and Russias most serious security crisis since the strongman came to power in late 1999. Wagner chief Yevgeny Prigozhin, once a close Putin ally, said his troops had taken control of the military command centre and bases in the southern city of Rostov-on-Don, the nerve centre of Russias offensive in Ukraine, and vowed to topple Moscows top military leaders. Further north, on Wagners possible route towards Moscow, the governor of Russias Voronezh region said the armed forces had launched a counter-terrorist operation to suppress the revolt. A fuel depot on Voronezh city was on fire, he said. The FSB security service accused Prigozhin of attempting to launch a civil conflict and urged Wagner fighters to detain him. Responding to the challenge in a televised address, Putin accused Prighozin -- whose private army provided shock troops for Moscows offensive in Ukraine -- of a stab in the back that posed a threat to Russias very survival. Any internal turmoil is a deadly threat to our statehood and to us as a nation. This is a blow to Russia and to our people, Putin said. This battle, when the fate of our people is being decided, requires the unification of all forces. Extravagant ambitions and personal interests led to treason, Putin said, referring to Prigozhin, who built his powerbase as a catering contractor to the Kremlin and now runs a private military force. All those who consciously stood on the path of betrayal, who prepared an armed rebellion, stood on the path of blackmail and terrorist methods, will suffer inevitable punishment, before the law and before our people, Putin vowed. The Russian presidents speech came shortly after Prigozhin posted a message of his own, apparently filmed in Rostov-on-Don, accusing the Russian military leadership of betrayal and failure in the ongoing battle against Ukrainian forces. A huge amount of territory is lost. Soldiers have been killed, three, four times more than what it says in documents shown to the top, he said, accusing commanders of hiding the true scale of Russian losses in Ukraine from the Kremlin. Military sites in Rostov, including an aerodrome, are under control, he said, adding that warplanes taking part in the Ukraine offensive are leaving as normal. Inside Ukraine, emergency services said that three people were killed and nearly a dozen injured in Kyiv after what authorities said was an overnight barrage of 40 Russian cruise missiles and at least two attack drones. Civil conflict After Putins speech accusing him of treason, Prigozhin launched a second broadside. On treason of the motherland: the president is deeply wrong. We are patriots of our motherland, Prigozhin said. Nobody plans to turn themselves in at the request of the president, the FSB or anyone else. Russias headquarters in Rostov-on-Don is a key logistical base for its offensive in Ukraine. Watching events unfold in Russia as his own forces conduct a slow-moving counteroffensive, Ukraines President Volodymyr Zelensky said the revolt showed Russias was failing. Russias weakness is obvious. Full-scale weakness, he said. And the longer Russia keeps its troops and mercenaries on our land, the more chaos, pain, and problems it will have for itself later. It is also obvious, that Ukraine is able to protect Europe from the spread of Russian evil and chaos. News photographs showed armed men surrounding administrative buildings in Rostov and tanks deployed in the city centre. It was not clear who the armed men were. The mayor of Moscow announced that anti-terrorist measures were being taken in the capital and authorities said security had been tightened in several regions. Critical facilities were under reinforced protection, TASS reported, citing a law enforcement source. Missile strikes Prosecutor General Igor Krasnov had informed Putin of the initiation of a criminal case in connection with an attempt to organise an armed rebellion, Kremlin spokesman Peskov said. While Prigozhins outfit fought at the forefront of Russias offensive in Ukraine, in recent months it has engaged in a bitter feud with Moscows military leadership. He has repeatedly blamed Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu and Valery Gerasimov, chief of the general staff, for his fighters deaths. The Russian defence ministry warned that Ukrainian troops were taking advantage of the infighting to ready an assault near the eastern hotspot of Bakhmut. A prominent Russian general urged Prigozhin to call off efforts to remove the defence ministry leadership. I urge you to stop, Sergei Surovikin, commander of Russias aerospace forces, said in a highly unusual video address. Washington-based think tank the Institute for the Study of War said the Wagner chiefs attempt to force a leadership change in the defence ministry is unlikely to succeed given that Surovikin had denounced his call for rebellion. However, it said Wagners apparent capture of Rostov-on-Don would have significant impacts on Russias war effort in Ukraine. US President Joe Biden was briefed on the situation in Russia and Washington will be consulting with allies and partners on these developments, National Security Council spokesman Adam Hodge said. France and Germany said they were closely following events. Italy warned its citizens in Russia to take care and UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak urged all parties to spare civilian life.

        "date": "June 24, 2023 07:19 pm",
        "content": "Sri Lanka is set to start bartering tea to Iran next month in lieu of 250 million owed for oil, a Sri Lankan official told Reuters on Friday, as the crisis-hit country tries to lift sales to a key market and protect its forex reserves. The barter was agreed upon in 2021 for oil imported in 2012, but the exchange was delayed after Sri Lankas unprecedented dollar shortage last year plunged the economy into its worst financial crisis in more than seven decades. This is very timely for us because we get access to an important market and both Iran and Sri Lanka can trade without relying on dollars, Sri Lankas Tea Board Chairman Niraj de Mel told Reuters. The agreement was to send 5 million worth of tea each month for 48 months but we plan to start with about 2 million per month. Globally popular Ceylon Tea is Sri Lankas highest foreign exchange-earning crop, brewing 1.25 billion for the cash-strapped country last year, according to government data. Iran has been one of Sri Lankas main tea buyers but exports have fallen steadily from 128 million in 2018 to 70 million last year as U.S. sanctions on Iran hit trade. A significant share of Sri Lankas tea is now shipped to Iran via the United Arab Emirates (UAE), official data shows, with the UAE more than doubling its tea imports from Sri Lanka to 118 million last year from 48 million five years ago. Under the barter programme, the state-run Ceylon Petroleum Corp that bought the oil will give rupees to the Tea Board to ship tea via Sri Lankan exporters. Iranian tea importers will then pay riyals to the National Iranian Oil Company, de Mel said. We are awaiting the final documents and hope to start exports from July, he added. Sri Lankas foreign exchange reserves grew to 3.5 billion at the end of May - a 14-month high - helped by increased remittances and tourism inflows after securing a 2.9 billion bailout from the International Monetary Fund.

        "content": "Sri Lanka Police has increased the reward money awarded through the Police Reward Scheme for tip-offs leading to successful seizures of unauthorized firearms and hand grenades. This was announced in a special communiqué directed to senior police officers by the Inspector-General of Police (IGP) C.D. Wickramaratne on Saturday (June 24). Accordingly, a generous amount of reward money is now offered to incentivize the police personnel and individual informants for their assistance in crackdown on the recent uptick in the number of crimes in the country. The payments will be made for the unauthorized firearms and hand grenades taken into custody between June 25 and July 31. As per the communiqué, Rs. 250,000 is awarded as reward money to a police officer who seizes an unauthorized T-56 firearm along with the suspect who was in possession of it and to the individual informant who provides a tip-off on the firearm. A police officer who seizes only the firearm is awarded Rs. 200,000 while the informant will be given Rs. 250,000 even if no arrests are made. For a tip-off on unauthorized pistols and revolvers, an informant will receive a reward of Rs. 250,000.

        "title": "Mutinous Russian mercenary boss turn his fighters back from Moscow to avoid bloodshed",
        "date": "June 25, 2023 12:45 am",
        "content": "Russia, June 24 (Reuters) - Mutinous Russian mercenaries who surged most of the way to Moscow have agreed to turn back to avoid bloodshed, their leader said on Saturday, in a de-escalation of what had become a major challenge to President Vladimir Putins grip on power. The fighters of the Wagner private army were just 200 km (125 miles) from the capital, said the leader, former Putin ally Yevgeny Prigozhin. The rebels had captured the city of Rostov hundreds of miles to the south before racing across the country. They wanted to disband the Wagner military company. We embarked on a march of justice on June 23. In 24 hours we got to within 200 km of Moscow. In this time we did not spill a single drop of our fighters blood, Prigozhin said in an audio message. Now the moment has come when blood could be spilled. Understanding ... that Russian blood will be spilled on one side, we are turning our columns around and going back to field camps as planned. The decision to halt further movement across Russia by the Wagner group was brokered by Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko in return for guarantees for their safety, his office said. There was no immediate word on the deal from Putin. Earlier, Prigozhin said that his march for justice was intended to remove corrupt and incompetent Russian commanders he blames for botching the war in Ukraine. In a televised address from the Kremlin, Putin said Russias very existence was under threat. We are fighting for the lives and security of our people, for our sovereignty and independence, for the right to remain Russia, a state with a thousand-year history, he said, vowing punishment for those who who prepared an armed insurrection. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said the Wagner revolt exposed complete chaos in Russia. Today the world can see that the masters of Russia control nothing. And that means nothing. Simply complete chaos. An absence of any predictability, Zelenskiy said in his nightly video address. Video obtained by Reuters showed troop carriers and two flatbed trucks each carrying a tank driving 30 miles (50 km) beyond Voronezh, more than half way to Moscow. A helicopter fired on them near Voronezh. More than 100 firefighters were in action at a fuel depot ablaze in Voronezh. Video footage obtained by Reuters showed it exploding in a fireball shortly after a helicopter flew by. Further along the road, video showed, vehicles apparently placed as barricades to slow Wagners advance had been tossed to one side. Prigozhin, whose private army fought the bloodiest battles in Ukraine even as he feuded for months with the military top brass, said he had captured the headquarters of Russias Southern Military District in the city of Rostov without firing a shot. WILL THERE BE CIVIL WAR? In Rostov, which serves as the main rear logistical hub for Russias entire invasion force in Ukraine, residents milled about calmly, filming on mobile phones as Wagner fighters in armoured vehicles and battle tanks took up positions. One tank was wedged between stucco buildings with posters advertising the circus. Another had Siberia daubed in red paint across the front, an apparent statement of intent to sweep across the breadth of Russia. Will there be civil war? a woman in Rostov asked the mercenaries who took over the city. No, everything will be fine, a fighter answered. The region surrounding Rostov is an important oil, gas and grains hub. In a series of hectic messages overnight, Prigozhin had demanded that Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu and the chief of the general staff Valery Gerasimov should come to see him in Rostov. SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGE Western capitals said they were closely following the situation in nuclear-armed Russia. U.S. President Joe Biden spoke with the leaders of France, Germany and Britain, while Secretary of State Antony Blinken spoke to counterparts from G7 nations. The top U.S. military officer, Army General Mark Milley, cancelled a scheduled trip to the Middle East because of the situation in Russia. The insurrection risked leaving Russias invasion force in Ukraine in disarray, just as Kyiv is launching its strongest counteroffensive since the war began in February last year. This represents the most significant challenge to the Russian state in recent times, Britains defence ministry said. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "date": "June 25, 2023 06:42 am",
        "content": "U.S. intelligence agencies found no direct evidence that the COVID-19 pandemic stemmed from an incident at Chinas Wuhan Institute of Virology, a report declassified on Friday said. The four-page report by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) said the U.S. intelligence community still could not rule out the possibility that the virus came from a laboratory, however, and had not been able to discover the origins of the pandemic. The Central Intelligence Agency and another agency remain unable to determine the precise origin of the COVID-19 pandemic, as both (natural and lab) hypotheses rely on significant assumptions or face challenges with conflicting reporting, the ODNI report said. The report said that while extensive work had been conducted on coronaviruses at the Wuhan institute (WIV), the agencies had not found evidence of a specific incident that could have caused the outbreak. We continue to have no indication that the WIVs pre-pandemic research holdings included SARSCoV-2 or a close progenitor, nor any direct evidence that a specific research-related incident occurred involving WIV personnel before the pandemic that could have caused the COVID pandemic, the report said. The origins of the coronavirus pandemic have been a matter of furious debate in the United States almost since the first human cases were reported in Wuhan in late 2019. U.S. President Joe Biden in March signed a bill declassifying information related to the origins of the pandemic. Biden said at the time of signing that he shared Congress goal of releasing as much information as possible about the origin of COVID-19. The debate was refueled by a Wall Street Journal report in February that the U.S. Energy Department had assessed with low confidence in a classified intelligence report that the pandemic most likely arose from a Chinese laboratory leak, an assessment Beijing denies. FBI director Christopher Wray said on Feb. 28 his agency had assessed for some time that the origins of the pandemic were most likely a potential lab incident in the Chinese city of Wuhan. China said this claim had no credibility whatsoever. As of March 20, four other U.S. agencies still judged that COVID-19 was likely the result of natural transmission, while two were undecided.

        "date": "June 25, 2023 04:49 pm",
        "content": "The worlds central bank umbrella body, the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), called on Sunday for more interest rate hikes, warning the world economy was now at a crucial point as countries struggle to rein in inflation. Despite the relentless rise in rates over the last 18 months, inflation in many top economies remains stubbornly high, while the jump in borrowing costs triggered the most serious banking collapses since the financial crisis 15 years ago. The global economy is at a critical juncture. Stern challenges must be addressed, Agustin Carstens, BIS general manager, said in the organisations annual report published on Sunday. The time to obsessively pursue short term growth is past. Monetary policy must now restore price stability. Fiscal policy must consolidate. Claudio Borio, the head of BISs monetary and economics unit, added there was a risk an inflationary psychology was now setting in, although the bigger-than-expected rate hikes in Britain and Norway last week showed central banks were pushing to get the job done in terms of tackling the problem. Their challenges are unique by post-World War Two standards though. It is the first time that, across much of the world, a surge in inflation has co-existed with widespread financial vulnerabilities. The longer inflation remains elevated, the stronger and prolonged the required policy tightening, the BIS report said, warning that the possibility of further problems in the banking sector was now material. If interest rates get to mid-1990s levels the overall debt service burden for top economies would, all else being equal, be the highest in history, Borio said. I think central banks will get inflation under control. That is their job  to restore price stability, he told Reuters. The question is what will the cost be. BANKING CRISES The Swiss-based BIS held its annual meeting in recent days, where top central bankers discussed the turbulent last few months. March and April saw a failure of a number of U.S. regional banks including Silicon Valley Bank and then the emergency rescue of Credit Suisse in the BISs own backyard. Historically, about 15 of rate hike cycles trigger severe stress in the banking system, the BIS report showed, although the frequency rises considerably if interest rates are going up, inflation is surging or house prices have been rising sharply. It can even be as high as 40 if the private debt-to-GDP ratio is in the top quartile of the historical distribution at the time of the first rate hike. Very high debt levels, a remarkable global inflation surge, and the strong pandemic-era increase in house prices check all these boxes, the BIS said. It estimated too that the cost of supporting aging populations will grow by approximately 4 and 5 of GDP in advanced (AEs) and emerging market economies (EMEs) respectively over the next 20 years. Absent belt-tightening by governments, that would push debt above 200 and 150 of GDP by 2050 in AEs and EMEs and could be even higher if economic growth rates wane. Part of the report published already last week also laid out a game changing blueprint for an evolved financial system where central bank digital currencies and tokenised banking assets speed up and smarten up transactions and global trade. Commenting further on the economic picture, Carstens, former head of Mexicos central bank, said the emphasis was now on policymakers to act. Unrealistic expectations that have emerged since the Great Financial Crisis and COVID-19 pandemic about the degree and persistence of monetary and fiscal support need to be corrected, he said. The BIS thinks an economic soft, or soft-ish landing - where rates rise without triggering recessions or major banking crashes - is still possible, but accepts it is a difficult situation. Analysts at Bank of America have calculated there have been a whopping 470 interest rate rises globally over the past 2 years compared with 1,202 cuts since the financial crash. The U.S. Federal Reserve has lifted its rates 500 basis points from near zero, the European Central Bank has hiked the euro zones by 400 bps and many developing world economies have done far more. The question remains what more will be needed, especially with signs that companies are taking the opportunity to boost profits and workers are now demanding higher wages to prevent a further erosion of their living standards. The easy gains have now been reaped and the last mile is going to be more difficult, Borio said, referring to challenges central bankers now face reeling inflation back to safe levels. I wouldnt be surprised if there were more surprises. Source - Reuters -Agencies",

        "date": "June 25, 2023 07:03 pm",
        "content": "The Pilots of SriLankan Airlines allege that they have been left in the lurch as a result of a spate of decisions by the management of the national carrier, compelling them to be overworked. In response to the recent statements in Parliament by Minister of Ports, Shipping and Aviation services Minister of Ports, Shipping and Aviation Services, Nimal Siripala De Silva and other members of Parliament regarding the purported conduct of Pilots of the Airline, the Pilots claim in a statement that there have been serious and often times critical issues which have not been addressed by the Management of the Airline resulting in the current catastrophic state of affairs. Whilst iterating our commitment and dedication to our beloved Airline, the passengers of the Airline and the country as a whole we wish to state that there have been serious and oftentimes critical issues which have not been addressed by the Management of the Airline resulting in the current catastrophic state of affairs, it said. Meanwhile, the Pilots emphasize that the Airline requires at least 330 Pilots to function in full capacity for the designated flights, adding that however, over 70 Pilots have resigned from the Airline in the last year with many more resignations pending due to the issues faced by the Pilots. This has resulted in a complete depletion of Pilots, the statement added. The severity of the issue was witnessed in the recent incident where there were no Pilots on standby to be assigned to a flight which eventually departed more than 12 hours later than the scheduled time of departure. Furthermore, they assert that SriLankan Airlines pays one of the lowest wages well below industry standards to Pilots. Prior to June 2023, the Pilots were paid their salaries at an arbitrary USD the contracted currency by which Pilots are remunerated capped at the rate of initially LKR 188 then LKR225 subsequently LKR295 (since December) which was nearly 40below the rate of the Central Bank. This issue took years of union intervention and discussions to resolve, it mentioned. The Pilots of SriLankan Airlines express that during the Covid-19 pandemic, the Pilots salaries were approximately lowered by 50 per cent, claiming that at present however, despite all other departments in the Airline being given increments and ex-gratia (bonus) payments the Pilots are yet to receive a substantial part of their contractually due salary package which was in place before the Covid-19 outbreak. Despite the said salary cut the Pilots continued to work helping the Airline generate revenue and most importantly providing our services for critical medical supplies and other essential and urgent requirements for the Country during the crisis. These are despite predictions by the Chief Executive Officer of the Airline promising a profit of 50 Million USD this year. All Pilots of the Airline have educated themselves with private funding have over the years borne the cost of their training at SriLankan Airlines, the statement added. In addition, the Pilots also raise concerns in the statement that the cadre of Pilots which should ideally be at 330 now only has approximately 250 as a result of the shortsighted, arbitrary and callous decisions of the Management. It is obvious that we as individuals and professionals focused on flight safety, cannot be expected to sustain the extra burden on each individual which the Airline now demands as a result of its own folly, they expressed. Further, they mention that the recent issues regarding flights stem from these actions and inactions of the Management itself which the Management have continuously refused to pay heed to. We have as a body at all times raised these concerns repeatedly including by way of litigation due to the attitude of the Management of the Airline. We urge that these matters be brought to the notice and the attention of the general public and all stakeholders of the Airline in order to facilitate the issues raised being addressed and resolved, it added.",

        "content": "The Government is paying close attention to certain parties attempts to satisfy their political needs by giving the Aswasuma program, which was created to aid those in need of economic stability, a political façade, the Presidents Media Division (PMD) said. However, the Government assures that any shortcomings in the process of selecting the relevant candidates will be rectified immediately and plans are being made to discuss this with the district secretaries, divisional secretaries, and other parties involved in the program in the coming week. Accordingly, these payments will be distributed among four social categories, namely transitional, vulnerable, poor, and extremely poor. Additionally, the usual allowances for the differently-abled, elderly, and kidney patients will also be provided, the PMD said. 6728 officers were employed in the data collection process for the information survey of the program to identify those who are eligible for welfare benefit payments, covering all the divisional secretariats across the island. It included 3190 development officers, 494 economic development officers, 205 Grama Niladhari officers, 1127 other officers and 1712 temporary recruits. At the regional office level, a three-member selection committee will monitor the data and, after approval by the district secretary, the deserving candidates will be selected, it added. Prime Minister Dinesh Gunawardena as the Provincial Councils and Local Government Minister announced this morning (25) that the time period given to those who have been wronged in the selection of the beneficiaries of the Aswesuma welfare benefit payment program to hand over appeals and objections has been extended until July 10, as some parties have alleged that there have been shortcomings in the process. The necessary work is also being carried out in this regard by Acting Finance Minister Shehan Semasinghe and Finance State Minister Ranjith Siyambalapitiya, according to the PMD. Accordingly, if an individual or family in need of economic stability has lost this benefit, there is an opportunity to correct it by making inquiries through the Divisional Secretariats during the relevant period. The Government emphasizes that the basic requirement of the Aswesuma program is to provide the necessary contribution to the people who need economic stability, and not to meet the needs of various parties based on a mere political process. The Government advises against panicking as a result of yielding to political instigation or external influences if your name is not on the currently published list or if the name of an ineligible individual is on it. Instead, make any pertinent queries through the Divisional Secretariat Offices. The Government further informs the applicants that they can contact the Divisional Secretary for assistance with any issues that may have developed with regard to their applications, it said. Earlier today, State Minister of Finance Shehan Semasinghe stated that the Welfare Benefit Board would intervene if any injustice is observed in the beneficiary selection process. Taking into Twitter, he also notified that the relevant officials have been informed so that the people can hand over appeals and objections under the Aswasuma welfare benefits program personally at the Divisional Secretariats across the island. For any further inquiries, the general public can contact the hotline number 1924 which is operational on weekdays from 8.00 a.m. to 5.00 p.m., according to the minister.",

        "content": "Sri Lanka powered into the Super Six stage of the Cricket World Cup qualifying tournament with a crushing 133-run win over Ireland on Sunday that eliminated their opponents. The result also guaranteed Scotland and Oman will join Sri Lanka in progressing from Group B. Opener Dimuth Karunaratne made a run-a-ball 103 and Sadeera Samarawickrama hit 82 as Sri Lanka compiled an imposing total of 325 all out off 49.5 overs after being put in to bat in Bulawayo. Mark Adair took 4-46 and Barry McCarthy claimed 3-56 but Irelands pace spearhead Josh Little conceded 78 runs in eight wicketless overs. Karunaratne and Samarawickrama put on 168 for the third wicket after Kusal Mendis was trapped lbw first ball by McCarthy. Charith Asalanka (38) and Dhananjaya de Silva (42 not out) also chipped in as Ireland sought to limit the damage in the closing overs. Ireland needed a victory to keep their qualification hopes alive, but they lost experienced opener Paul Stirling for six and the wheels soon came off. Captain Andy Balbirnies dismissal reduced Ireland to 57-3 and Lorcan Tucker was bowled for a duck the next over before Wanindu Hasaranga pinned Harry Tector in front for 33. Curtis Campher, who made a century in the gut-wrenching loss to Scotland, briefly countered in his knock of 39 but once he top-edged to the wicketkeeper Ireland were all but doomed. Hasaranga finished with 5-79, giving the Sri Lankan leg-spinner 16 wickets in three qualifiers so far in Zimbabwe. Source - AFP -Agencies",

Making a special statement regarding the matter this evening (25), the CBSL chief also assured that no deposit in any bank in the country will be affected in the process of restructuring domestic debt and that interests will not be affected. The main reason for announcement of bank holiday on (June) 30th was to create a sufficient number of days for domestic debt optimization strategy that has been discussed with the Central Bank and the Ministry of Finance, he said. Furthermore, Dr. Weerasinghe emphasized that the strategy has to be announced, implemented and obtain the proper approval process from the Cabinet of Ministers, committees in the parliament and also the parliament debates, adding that the process requires at least around 04 days. Continuously, during the dates the debt market and the economy market should not function because their information is very market sensitive If those proposals are discussed in the public, those sensitive markets are not functioning, he added. In addition, the CBSL Chief also mentioned that even though June 30th is a bank holiday, all the banking activities that can be done during the period, with banks physically opening or not, can be carried out as usual. For an example the internet banking, ATM withdrawals and fund transfers on accounts that can be done with banks physically opening or not can be carried out, he said. Meanwhile, Dr. Weerasinghe ensured that there will be no reduction of bank deposits that people are having in commercial banks and non-banking institutions, and also no reduction will take place in interest rates that they are currently receiving in terms of their contracts with the banks. If the banks have agreed to provide some interest rates, they will continue to be received by the deposit holders. They will not be affected adversely anyway with the domestic debt optimization strategy, he asserted. On June 23, the government declared a special bank holiday on June 30, 2023. This was announced in a special gazette notification issued by Prime Minister Dinesh Gunawardena in his capacity as the Minister of Public Administration, Home Affairs, Provincial Councils  Local Government.

The order has been issued by the Appeals Court judge bench consisting of Justices Nissanka Bandula Karunaratne and A. Marikkar, while ruling on the writ petition filed by the Senior DIG today (June 26). Meanwhile, the Court of Appeal has also issued a writ order invalidating a letter issued by the Attorney General to name SDIG Tennakoon as a suspect in the incident of attacking the GotaGoGama protest site at the Galle Face Green on May 09. SDIG Tennakoon had filed a writ petition calling for a court order to prevent the hearing of a private complaint filed against him before the Colombo Fort Magistrates Court, stating that the summons issued by the Colombo Fort Magistrates Court ordering him to appear before the courts in relation to the private complaint filed was, in fact, against the law.

        "content": "Human remains have been found in the Southern California area where British actor Julian Sands went missing five months ago, BBC reported. In a statement, The San Bernardino County Sheriffs Department said that it had been contacted around 10 a.m. local time on Saturday by California hikers who had found human remains in the Mount Baldy wilderness, which is more than 40 miles northeast of Los Angeles. The remains have been transported to the coroners office for identification, the department said. The identification process is expected to take about a week. Notably, the 65-year-old performer was reported missing by his wife on Friday evening, January 13, after he had gone hiking in the Baldy Bowl area of the San Gabriel Mountains, according to Variety. The Baldy Bowl, about 50 miles northeast of Los Angeles just below the Mount Baldy ski area, is a popular destination for skiers, climbers, and hikers. A search was immediately launched in the area, but ground teams were pulled out a day later due to avalanche risks and poor trail conditions. A June 17 search for Sands, the eighth organized search since his disappearance, was also unsuccessful, authorities said. Despite the recent warmer weather, portions of the mountain remain inaccessible due to extreme alpine conditions. Multiple areas include steep terrain and ravines, which still have 10-plus feet of ice and snow, San Bernardino County Sheriffs Office said last week. Last week, the Sands family shared a statement, expressing their gratitude for the ongoing search and rescue efforts. We are deeply grateful to the search teams and coordinators who have worked tirelessly to find Julian. We continue to hold Julian in our hearts with bright memories of him as a wonderful father, husband, explorer, lover of the natural world and the arts, and as an original and collaborative performer, they said. Born in England, Mr. Sands moved to California in the 1980s to pursue a Hollywood career after the success of the 1985 film A Room with a View, a period romance in which he was cast as the leading man opposite Helena Bonham Carter. He also starred as the son of Satan in the 1989 supernatural thriller Warlock and its sequel Warlock: The Armageddon. Other film credits include supporting roles in The Killing Fields, Arachnophobia and Leaving Las Vegas. Source  NDTV -Agencies",

        "date": "June 26, 2023 12:50 pm",
        "content": "Gains in oil prices evaporated on Monday after a brief and chaotic insurrection in Russia, with investors questioning whether the turmoil in Moscow could disrupt global energy supplies. US WTI crude briefly climbed 1.3 during Asian trading hours. But it later gave up those gains, last trading flat. Brent crude, the international benchmark, inched up 0.1, trimming earlier advances. Both futures lost nearly 4 last week. Russia glimpsed the threat of armed insurrection over the weekend, with Wagner Group mercenaries marching toward Moscow as President Vladimir Putin vowed retribution, before a sudden deal seemed to defuse the crisis as quickly as it had emerged. Although the immediate risk of bloodshed appears to have dissipated, much remains uncertain. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Sunday that the insurrection shows cracks in Putins role as a leader of the country. The potential risks to watch may be on any renewed opposition from the Russian public to Putins leadership, said Yeap Jun Rong, market analyst at IG Group. Signs that global energy demand could weaken this year as economies slow have pushed US crude prices down by nearly 14 so far this year to just under 70 a barrel. (It peaked above 120 a year ago.) The international benchmark, Brent crude, is down by a similar margin. But anything that could jeopardize Russias ability to keep supplying global energy markets will be watched anxiously by policymakers in the West and by the countrys biggest customers in Asia. Stocks choppy Asian stock markets were choppy on Monday. Japans Nikkei 225 (N225) opened lower but soon reversed its losses and edged up 0.2. South Koreas Kospi also rebounded from opening losses and rose 0.5. Hong Kongs Hang Seng (HSI) Index traded slightly lower amid a seesaw session. But Chinas Shanghai Composite declined 0.7, and Australias SPASX 200 lost 0.5. Stocks could get a momentary lift on hopes that the Wagner insurrection could mark the start of an earlier end to the Ukraine conflict, but the weight of the current economic slowdown in the US and the continuation of higher interest rates are likely to drag stock prices lower, said Clifford Bennett, chief economist at Australias ACY Securities. Last Friday, global markets fell broadly as investors became increasingly worried that more interest rate hikes by central banks would tip major economies into a prolonged recession. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said last Wednesday that further rises in interest rates were likely necessary this year to bring US inflation down to the central banks 2 target. This was followed by a sharper-than-expected hike in UK borrowing costs by the Bank of England Thursday, which opted for an increase of half a percentage point after data earlier this week revealed surprisingly stubborn inflation. And then on Friday, data showed that Japanese inflation excluding fresh food and energy costs hit a 42-year high of 4.3, fueling speculation the Bank of Japan might rethink its loose monetary policy and start tightening.

The undertaking was given when a petition filed by environmental organisations against the alleged proposal to export 100,000 Toque Macaque monkeys to China was taken up before the court today (June 26). The petition had been filed by a total of 27 parties, including the Wildlife and Nature Protection Society of Sri Lanka, Otara Gunawardena, Ven. Ananda Sagara Thero and Rukshan Jayawardena, claiming that reports have revealed that the monkeys are being exported to China for lab-testing purposes. Citing that such a move would constitute an act of animal cruelty while also defying the Fauna and Flora Protection Ordinance, the petitioners therefore sought an order preventing the exportation of the monkeys, while also seeking an order against the Director General of the Department of Wildlife Conservation, preventing him from issuing licenses for such exports. 30 Petitioners, including the Wildlife and Nature Protection Society of Sri Lanka, Rescue Animals Sri Lanka, RARE Sri Lanka, Justice for Animals and others, had filed action in the Court of Appeal pursuant to the statement made by Minister Mahinda Amaraweera that there were plans being made to export toque macaque monkeys from Sri Lanka to China. The case was filed before the Court of Appeal seeking a court order to prevent the proposed export of toque macaque monkeys from Sri Lanka to China. When the case was taken up today, the Attorney General appeared and stated in open court that they have received instructions from the Department of Wildlife and Conservation that they will not be taking steps to export monkeys to China. The case will be taken up before the Court of Appeal on 6th July to record the above undertaking given to the Court by the State.

        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe has assured that Sri Lanka has qualified for the assistance from the World Bank since all the required benchmarks for financial assistance from the WB have been fulfilled so far and that the much-needed funds will help strengthen the countrys economy. Speaking in an interview with FRANCE 24 on the sidelines of the Summit for a New Global Financing Pact in Paris, President Wickremesinghe mentioned that the World Banks assistance is much needed at the moment and will certainly help to strengthen the economy. Anticipating money from the World Bank, so far we have fulfilled all the benchmarks. Therefore we are qualifying for assistance from the World Bank. It is a much-needed money at the moment and will certainly help to strengthen the economy, he said. However, the Head of the State did not exactly confirm whether the amount will be USD 700 million, as earlier reported by foreign media. I hope there will be more. Im not going to complain about the amount, he said. Furthermore, the president mentioned that the debt restructuring programme will be presented to the Cabinet on Wednesday and that it will be presented to the parliament and before the Committee on Public Finance (COPF) on Friday. He also stated that the programme will be debated in parliament on Sunday and will be approved by parliament. Discussions are going on with different groups. We have an agreement with Lazards a Financial services company to represent us at the international level. The debt restructuring programme will be presented to the Cabinet on Wednesday. We hope to finalise it. It goes to the parliament on Friday, before the Public Finance Committee, and on Sunday it will be debated in parliament and will be approved by parliament, the President claimed. Thereafter we can start the rest of our negotiations with our creditors. We have been discussing with all the creditors and with China. In addition, Wickremesinghe expressed that China has not joined the common platform but theyve been there at every meeting, and all details have been shared with China, while Beijing in turn has shared information with them. Except for formally being on the platform, China has been a party and aware of all the information that is being shared, he mentioned. Meanwhile, in response to a question whether Sri Lanka plans to postpone the debt, reduce it or a combination of both, Wickremesinghe mentioned that the government was looking at some form of a reduction of the debts. Discussions are underway. Hopefully, on Sunday or Monday, the document will be available to us. During the discussion, questions were also raised regarding the speculations on whether the presence of China in Sri Lanka will be a military presence. In reply, the President pointed out that there are a lot of speculations about the Hambantota Harbour, adding that although it has been given out to China Merchants Group, the security is controlled by the Sri Lankan government. He further emphasized that the Southern Naval Command will be shifted to Hambantota. We have got one brigade stationed in Hambantota and nearby areas, and there certainly has been no issue of military use by the Chinese. China has been there for 1,500 years. So far, there has been no military base, he asserted. The same company also runs a terminal in the Colombo Harbour and thats where warships come from all countries, the president expressed, adding that We have no military agreements with China. Wickremesinghe, who highlighted that Sri Lanka is a neutral country, ensured that the government will not allow Sri Lanka to be used as a base for any threats against India. The President, who responded to a question on whether the country is being sold off, emphasized that working with foreign economies does not mean that the country is being sold off, but it means that the countrys economy is being developed. We are working with foreign economies, not only Western but also Eastern like Japan, China, and Korea. Working with them does not mean that we are selling off the country. It means that we are developing the economy, he added. Its just sort of a debate that goes on in Sri Lankan politics. They have not been able to reply, he said, referring to the accusations by opposition groups. Responding to another question raised during the discussion whether Sri Lanka will satisfy the demands of the Tamils for an international probe into the war crimes, the Head of the State expressed that the South African style Truth and Reconciliation Commission has been agreed by all and thats one of the conditions that the Geneva Human Rights Commission has also taken up. It the commission was drafted some time ago, but after I became the president, I have been talking with South Africa about establishing the commission. I will get it passed in parliament by August. The President assured that the legislation of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission is likely to be enacted by August. In my view, the legislation will be enacted by August, he said. Commenting further on the Tamils, President Wickremesinghe expressed that the economy and social standards of the Tamils, especially the Tamil people living in the Hill Country are needed to be uplifted. They are of course taking part in the politics and they have members serving in the central cabinet, the President mentioned. President Wickremesinghe was also questioned whether there will be any investigations into former President Gotabhaya Rajapaksa regarding his role during the war, where he replied that he would like any allegations to come before the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, adding that anyone else can go before the commission and that they can call anyone, even the former president before the commission. He further highlighted that no one can say the Truth and Reconciliation Commission is covered-up, as there will be foreign observers.",

Speaking on the timeliness of the procurement of medicines, Keheliya Rambukwella, Minister of Health commented, The Ministry of Health is grateful for the support provided in the procurement of life saving medicines at a crucial time for the people of Sri Lanka, as a part of the Ministrys efforts to address the shortage of medicines through such collaborative efforts. Although significant steps have been taken to curb the identified gaps, the supply shortage within the domestic healthcare market has been persistent since 2022. According to the Ministry of Health, there is a shortage of over 100 types of drugs in government hospitals, and many vital and essential medicines in the private and public sectors are out of stock. Highlighting the role of UNDP in facilitating processes to strengthen the healthcare sector in Sri Lanka, Ms. Azusa Kubota, Resident Representative, UNDP in Sri Lanka stated, Through the multi-sectoral platform which UNDP spearheaded, partners such as the Michelin Foundation came quickly together to respond to the acute needs of the people of Sri Lanka during these critical times.

UNDPs extensive global procurement network made it possible for us to deliver medicines with efficiency and speed. Commenting on the role of the private sector in supporting public sectors, Mr. Koenraad Pringiers stated, Michelin Lanka has a 40-year history in supporting the communities of Sri Lanka with various CSR projects that have benefited thousands of people. We were happy to partner with the UNDP in procuring the medicines and thank the Michelin Corporate Foundation for the grant and patronage, further cementing the close relationship the group has with the country. Sri Lankans are resilient, and we hope to emerge out of these difficult times, and we are happy to support this project.

The vehicle, driven by a twenty-eight-year-old man, was traveling, presumably at high speed, via Capodimonte in the direction of the entrance to the ring road, when at the height of the Basilica it lost control, impacting the pole located at the edge of the roadway. The violent impact caused the death of the 42-year-old Sri Lankan who was occupying the back seat of the car, while the driver and the other passenger were saved by the deployment of the airbags, the report said. The 118 emergency medical service doctors intervened on the spot who were only able to ascertain the death of the unfortunate victim. Meanwhile the personnel of the local police of Naples had carried out the findings of the accident and subjected the driver to tests on the use of alcohol or drugs, of which results are awaited. The driver was referred to the AG for vehicular homicide, it said. From the initial findings carried out by the local police of Naples, it became clear that the deceased was not wearing seat belts that could have saved his life, the report added.

Sri Lankas foreign minister, Ali Sabry, as well as 12 other MPs who are members of the Sri Lanka-China Friendship Association are in China for an official visit. In an interview with Chinas state-run news channel  CGTN, the Sri Lankan MP delegation leader Namal Rajapaksa spoke about the countrys aspirations for fostering friendship with China. We believe it is time to restart people-to-people relationships, strengthening not only the bilateral relationship between political parties and governments but also ensuring the message reaches the masses in both countries. Sri Lanka and China have been longstanding friends, and the benefits have been reciprocal. China has stood by Sri Lanka during difficult times, and similarly, Sri Lanka has always adhered to the One-China policy, he said. He said Sri Lankas foreign minister is presently visiting Beijing, and hopefully that the Sri Lankan president will also visit by the end of the year. This provides an opportunity for us to reconsider strengthening our cooperation through free trade agreements and various other strategic development projects that can bring mutual benefits to both countries. The parliamentarian was also asked about how he sees the increasing trend of more and more countries refusing to take sides in the contest between global powers. I think we should not focus on geographic divisions such as West, East, South, or any other continent. But, we should view things based on mutual interests between countries and global development partners, he said in response. I dont think it is correct to label a country, party, or government as aligned to the West or East. The priority should always be the well-being of our own people and meeting their needs. Asked about his take on Chinas so-called debt trap diplomacy, Rajapaksa said: Its all about geopolitics. Unfortunately, for the last two decades, Sri Lanka has been a victim. Most of the infrastructure that they are talking about restructuring has been developed with Chinese funds. If it is a trap, who would come and invest? he questioned. The reason is simple: its a credible and lucrative business venture. With the strategic location being utilized effectively, they are looking at restructuring and getting investments in. --Agencies",

Mahavamsa covers the historical accounts of Sri Lanka from the period 6th Century BCE to 1815 CE. The Mahavamsa  one of the worlds longest unbroken historical accounts  is the first of its kind in South Asia, initiating a mature historiographic tradition, presenting Sri Lankas history in chronological order from the 6th century BCE. The authenticity of the facts provided in the document has been confirmed through archaeological research conducted in Sri Lanka and India. It is an important historical source in South Asia containing crucial information about the lifetime of the Buddha, the Emperor Asoka and the rise of Buddhism as a world religion. The document has played a significant role in popularizing Buddhism in Southeast Asia and contributed singularly to the identity of Emperor Asoka in the Indian history. The existence of number of manuscripts of Mahavamsa in several countries as well as the transliteration and translation of the text to several Southeast Asian and European languages stand testimony to its immense historical, cultural, literal, linguistic and scholarly values. The Memory of the World Register lists documentary heritage that has been recommended by the International Advisory Committee, and endorsed by the Director-General of UNESCO, as corresponding to the selection criteria regarding world significance and outstanding universal value.",

        "content": "Officers of Hanguranketha Police on Monday night (June 26) fired dozens of warning shots into the air after more than 200 people tried to storm the police station for not arresting a group of suspects. According to the police, the group of men and women had behaved in an unruly manner and tried to forcibly enter the Hanguranketha police station expressing their dissatisfaction with ongoing investigations into the death of a resident of the area. It was observed that most of the unrestrained protesters were under the influence of alcohol at the time of the incident, the police media division said, adding that some of them also hurled stones at the police officers. As the group was becoming violent, two cops, on the orders of the Hanguranketha Police OIC, fired nearly 38 warning shots into the air to take the tense situation under control. The police emphasized that the warning shots were fired after taking into account the safety of the officers at the site and possible damages to the police station in the event the unruly protesters forcibly entered the premises. Following the shooting, the group had stopped attempting to storm the police station and staged a protest on the Hanguranketha-Kandy main road for nearly an hour. No casualties were reported in the incident, the police said, vowing to identify those who were involved in the unruly protest and to take legal action against them. On June 25, a resident of Diyathilakapura in Hanguranketha, who was under medical care at the Kandy National Hospital after being brutally assaulted, succumbed to injuries. During police investigations, a female suspect was arrested and remanded in connection with the assault. However, 08 other suspects who were complicit in the crime are currently at large. The police said, the group of protesters who tried to storm the Hanguranketha police station last night, were urging the officers to expedite the investigations despite being informed that probes are in progress to apprehend the perpetrators.",

Speaking to CNBC during his visit to China, Sabry spoke of several matters of concern, including the potential ways in which China could aid Sri Lankas propelled growth. The foreign minister, who is in China to participate in the World Economic Forum being held in Tianjin from 27  29 June, met with his counterpart and Chinese State Councilor Qin Gang, the Chairman of the Export-Import Bank of China and Chinas Finance Minister, and deemed all discussions held with these individuals as very fruitful and cordial. All those discussions were very very fruitful and very cordial and they have given us the undertaking that they will continue to support Sri Lankas next space of development, he said. Speaking further on Zambias recent deal with China to restructure USD 6.3 billion in loans, Sabry emphasised that the deal in question gave Sri Lanka a lot of optimism and hope, adding that it was time for a global debt restructuring architecture. I think its time that we need to have a global debt restructuring architecture which would help smaller countries, emerging economies and frontier countries so that they could quickly get out of the trouble and get into the next space without being embroiled in controversy forever, he said in this regard. Commenting on Sri Lankas current economic situation, Sabry acknowledged that while the country has made moderate gains over the last 10 months, there is a still a long way to go. Things are looking better compared to what it used to be, but we have a long way to go, he said. The Minister of Foreign Affairs also noted that discussions are underway with several parties including bilateral, multilateral and local creditors and bond holders, including private and commercial creditors, in order to restructure Sri Lankas debt, as part of working in accordance with the International Monetary Funds (IMF) debt sustainability analysis, in order to obtain he agreed Extended Fund Facility (EFF) of USD 2.4 billion.",

        "content": "Snowflake a cloud data analytics company, is partnering with computing company Nvidia to allow customers ranging from financial institutions to healthcare and retail to build AI models using their own data. The two companies announced the partnership at Snowflake Summit 2023 on Monday. In the old days, in small data computing, you moved data to the computer, Nvidia Chief Executive Jensen Huang told Reuters. But when you have giant amounts of data like Snowflake does, and the pile of proprietary data ... data thats so valuable to a company, then you move the compute to the data. In this case, Nvidia is taking a fairly engineering intensive move of embedding its NeMo platform for training and running generative AI models into the Snowflake Data Cloud, said Huang. The partnership comes as chatbot ChatGPT has pushed many companies to find their AI strategies and has propelled Nvidia, which provides the main hardware for AI, to becoming a trillion dollar company. This is significant. This is the last mile that weve been waiting for 40 years, said Frank Slootman, Chairman and CEO of Snowflake. Every industry is on this. They used to say software is eating the world. Well, now data is eating software, he said about the importance of data today. Slootman said companies that use Snowflake to manage their data will be able to now use their own data to train new AI models to gain an advantage in business without risking losing control of it. No financial details of the partnership were disclosed, but Huang said Nvidia would benefit as more customers use computing for AI work. We sell more chips, and we have an operating system for AI called Nvidia AI Enterprise. And that operating system makes it possible for our chips to process AI, said Huang. Nvidia charges customers for the use of its Nvidia AI Enterprise software. Source  Reuters -Agencies",

        "content": "The police today (June 27) arrested 08 suspects over their complicity in the murder of a youth in Hanguranketha area. The suspects, aged between 19 and 63 years, were taken into custody after they surrendered to the Kandy Police earlier today. They were identified as residents of Mathurata, Rikillagaskadawala and Udawaththakumbura areas. According to police media spokesperson SSP Nihal Thalduwa, a 48-year-old woman is also among the arrestees. Last Wednesday (June 21), a 23-year-old named Sandalu Santhush and his father sustained critical injuries after being brutally assaulted by a group over a land dispute. The father-son duo was fighting for life at the Kandy National Hospital for over four days until they succumbed to injuries on Monday (June 26). According to relatives of the victims, a woman residing in the area had forcefully claimed the ownership of a house built on a piece of land belonging to Santhushs father. However, as per a court order, Santhushs father had reclaimed the ownership, after which he visited the house with his wife to clean it up and fix the locks. The woman in question, accompanied by a group of thugs, had barged into the house and started to behave in an unruly manner. The violent mob had then assaulted Santhushs parents, before locking them up inside the house. However, the couple had managed to seek help from the emergency hotline 119. Police officers, who arrived at the scene to help Santhushs parents, had informed the two sides to visit the police station later to settle the matter. Following the departure of the police officers, the group of thugs had attacked Santhushs parents with chilli powder-mixed water. The father then telephoned Santhush, asking him to pick them up, however, upon his arrival, the group had returned to the house only to unleash another brutal attack on them. Santhush, who sustained life-threatening injuries to his head, was initially rushed to the Hanguranketha Divisional Hospital before being transferred to the Kandy National Hospital. His father was meanwhile moved to the ICU of the Kandy National Hospital with 52 stitches on his head after initially getting 15 surgical sutures at the Hanguranketha Divisional Hospital. After receiving medical care for 4 days, Santhush and his father succumbed to injuries yesterday (June 26). Last night, the neighbours who were infuriated by the murder of the father-son duo tried to storm the Hanguranketha police station, expressing their dissatisfaction with the failure of the police to apprehend the rest of the suspects who were at large. As the tense situation ensued, the police officers had fired nearly 38 warning shots into the air in an attempt to disperse the unruly protesters, who then proceeded to stage a demonstration on the Hanguranketha-Kandy main for nearly an hour.",

        "content": "Nearly 190,000 appeals have been received thus far pertaining to the beneficiaries list of the Aswesuma welfare benefits scheme, State Minister of Finance Shehan Semasinghe said. Accordingly, 188,794 appeals and 3,304 objections have been received thus far, Semasinghe clarified, adding that for any further inquiries, the general public can contact the hotline number 1924 which is operational on weekdays from 8.00 a.m. to 5.00 p.m. On 25 June, the State Minister announced that all relevant officials have been informed so that the people can hand over appeals and objections under the Aswesuma social security scheme personally at the Divisional Secretariats across the island. The final beneficiary list of Aswesuma Social Welfare Programme is not been published yet  after evaluating the appeals and objections received Government Agents (GAs) and Assistant GAs will publish the final beneficiary list. If further injustice is found, the Welfare Benefits Board will intervene, he said in a Twitter statement dated 24 June. Meanwhile, on 25 June, the Presidents Media Division (PMD) noted that the Government is paying close attention to certain parties attempts to satisfy their political needs by giving the Aswasuma program a political façade. However, the Government assured that any shortcomings in the process of selecting the relevant candidates will be rectified immediately and plans are being made to discuss this with the district secretaries, divisional secretaries, and other parties involved in the program in the coming week. Joining the press conference held at the Presidential Media Center (PMC), State Finance Minister Shehan Semasinghe further said; As a nation, we had to endure a massive economic depression in the recent past. As a main part of recovering the country from that situation, the Aswesuma social welfare benefit program was initiated with the aim of providing the necessary contribution to the people who need economic stability, while protecting the poor and vulnerable groups of the population. In general, there has always been a tendency in our country to rely on those benefits rather than empowering those who sign up for social welfare programs and boosting the economy. However, it must be noted that this program is one that goes above and beyond that. The relevant candidates were selected in accordance with the Welfare Benefits Act No. 24 of 2001. The selection of these deserving candidates was done under six sections and related indicators. According to this, a list of the eligible beneficiaries was drafted. However, it should be noted that it is not the final list. I ask any individual or family who believes they should be eligible for this benefit but whose name is not included in the list that has been published so far, to submit an appeal to the appropriate Divisional Secretariat Offices within the allotted time frame. Additionally, enquiries can be made if it contains the name of an ineligible person. We request the people not to panic as a result of yielding to political instigation or external influences and not to join the agitation actions to fulfill the interests of certain political groups. Also, I request everyone to work accordingly with the system implemented by the Government. However, we expect to prepare the final list of social welfare benefits candidates after the appeal period ends. President Ranil Wickremesinghe has advised us to prevent any injustice towards the Aswesuma beneficiaries. Among these, the list of beneficiaries receiving differently-abled, elderly, and kidney support allowances is also expected to be released in the near future.",

        "date": "June 27, 2023 04:21 pm",
        "content": "In a major breakthrough, astronauts on board the International Space Station (ISS) have attained a 98 water restoration rate using an advanced system that recycles astronauts urine and sweat into drinkable water. The development holds immense potential for future long interplanetary missions. The breakthrough was made possible using the subsystems that are part of the Environment Control and Life Support Systems (ECLSS), which is aimed at recycling consumables such as food, air and water for further use in space. Life support systems ideally need to recover close to 98 of the water that crew members bring along at the start of a long journey, Nasa said. This is because each crew member aboard ISS needs around a gallon of water each day for drinking, food preparation and hygiene usage. The space stations ECLSS recently demonstrated that it can achieve that significant goal. Christopher Brown, who is part of the team at Johnson Space Center that manages life support systems on the ISS, said, This is a very important step forward in the evolution of life support systems. Lets say you launch with 100 pounds of water. You lose two pounds of that, and the other 98 just keeps going around and around. Keeping that running is a pretty awesome achievement. ECLSS is a combination of hardware that includes a water recovery system. This system collects wastewater and sends it to the water processor assembly (WPA), which produces drinkable water. One specialised component uses advanced dehumidifiers to capture moisture released into the cabin air from crew breath and sweat. Another subsystem, the Urine Processor Assembly (UPA) recovers water from urine using vacuum distillation. A previous technology demonstration on the ISS tested improvements to the UPAs distillation assembly. Distillation produces water and a urine brine that still contains some reclaimable water. A Brine Processor Assembly (BPA) developed to extract this remaining wastewater has been on the space station as a demonstration of its operation in microgravity. Recent assessments found that the BPA helped the system achieve the 98 water recovery goal, Nasa said. Before the BPA, our total water recovery was between 93 and 94 overall. We have now demonstrated that we can reach a total water recovery of 98, said ECLSS water subsystems manager Jill Williamson. The 98 milestone is a significant development for future space missions that will see astronauts spend more time in space during long stays on the lunar surface and crewed missions to Mars. The regenerative ECLSS systems become ever more important as we go beyond low Earth orbit. The inability to resupply during exploration means we need to be able to reclaim all the resources the crew needs on these missions, Williamson said. Source - Times of India -Agencies",

The 14th annual honours will be presented at a ceremony at the Fairmont Century Plaza in Los Angeles on November 18, The Hollywood Reporter reported. The Academys Board of Governors is thrilled to honour four trailblazers who have transformed the film industry and inspired generations of filmmakers and movie fans, Academy president Janet Yang said in a statement. Across her decades-long career, Angela Bassett has continued to deliver transcendent performances that set new standards in acting. Mel Brooks lights up our hearts with his humour, and his legacy has made a lasting impact on every facet of entertainment. Carol Littletons career in film editing serves as a model for those who come after her. A pillar of the independent film community, Michelle Satter has played a vital role in the careers of countless filmmakers around the world. Honorary Oscars are presented each year to recognize extraordinary distinction in lifetime achievement, exceptional contributions to the state of motion picture arts and sciences or for outstanding service to the Academy. They tend to go to people who practice a variety of film-related disciplines, some household names and others not, and some of whom have previously been recognized with competitive Oscars and others whom have not. Bassett was twice nominated for but lost competitive Oscars, most recently earlier this year when she was up for Black Panther: Wakanda Forever. Her prior nom came 30 years earlier, for her star-making turn as Tina Turner in Whats Love Got to Do With It. Other major credits include Boyz N the Hood, Malcolm X, Waiting to Exhale, How Stella Got Her Groove Back and Black Panther. Brooks has won a competitive Oscar -- 54 years ago, for the screenplay of The Producers. He also received Oscar nominations for a song from Blazing Saddles and the screenplay for Young Frankenstein, which, like The Producers, he also directed and cameoed in. Other major credits include Silent Movie, High Anxiety, History of the World-- Part I and Spaceballs. And he is still working at 96 years old. Source  ANI -Agencies",
