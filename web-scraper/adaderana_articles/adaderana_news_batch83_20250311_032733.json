        "date": "January 16, 2024 06:35 pm",
        "content": "Rescuers evacuated tourists on Tuesday from a remote skiing area in northwestern China where dozens of avalanches triggered by heavy snow have trapped more than 1,000 people for a week, state media said. The avalanches have blocked roads, stranding both tourists and residents in a village in Altay prefecture in the Xinjiang region, close to Chinas border with Mongolia, Russia and Kazakhstan. Those injured were being airlifted out on a military helicopter while supplies such as food and fuel were being flown in. State broadcaster CCTV said a snow-blocked road linking Hemu village to major roads was cleared on Tuesday, enabling vehicles to enter and tourists to drive themselves out. Footage showed dozens of tourists dragging luggage over snow-covered areas toward a military helicopter, while a long line of outgoing cars was seen on the cleared road. State media cited the local highway administration as saying the avalanches affected 350 kilometers (220 miles) of roads. Road clearing efforts were hampered due to the areas geography as roads leading to Hemu are situated in a valley with tree-covered slopes. Known as an emerging ski destination, Altay prefecture had been hit by heavy snowfall since early January. China Daily, citing the Xinjiang meteorological bureau, said at least 31 avalanches were reported as of Saturday. Authorities at the Kanas scenic area, where Hemu village is located, said the area will be closed until at least Jan. 20 due to continued extreme weather. Source: The Associated Press --Agencies",

        "date": "January 16, 2024 06:48 pm",
        "content": "Addressing the Business Roundtable organized by BOI Sri Lanka and the Swiss-Asian Chamber of Commerce yesterday, during his official tour to Switzerland to attend the 54th Annual Meeting of the World Economic Forum, President Ranil Wickremesinghe highlighted significant strides in Sri Lankas economic recovery and outlined future growth prospects. President Wickremesinghe began by acknowledging the challenging times the nation faced, noting the adverse effects of the recent crisis on businesses, small enterprises and the overall population. He mentioned a constructive meeting with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), where it was surprising to learn that Sri Lanka had over performed despite the difficulties. One key aspect highlighted by the President was the successful debt restructuring in collaboration with the IMF, emphasizing its necessity for dealing with creditors. He outlined the reforms undertaken in 2022 and 2023, addressing crucial business impediments and resolving supply bottlenecks in fuel and electricity. Additionally, import restrictions were lifted, foreign exchange liquidity was restored and a primary surplus in the balance of payments is anticipated for the first time since 1977. President Wickremesinghe highlighted positive indicators such as the stabilization of the currency, a significant reduction in inflation, and the reversal of negative economic growth from the third quarter of 2023. The achievement of a primary budget surplus in 2023 marked a notable improvement. The President went on to discuss the effective progress in debt restructuring, with key creditors agreeing in principle. The IMFs approval of Sri Lankas first program review in December 2023 sets the stage for a shift from stabilization to recovery and growth in 2024. Looking ahead, President Wickremesinghe emphasized the governments focus on fostering growth through exports, services and investments, including foreign direct investment (FDI). He announced concluded and upcoming FTAs with Singapore, Thailand, India and China, along with ongoing talks with other South Asian nations. The President highlighted Sri Lankas initiatives to join the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) and the benefits of GSP Plus for access to European markets. The address concluded with the President unveiling opportunities for investments in renewable energy, agriculture modernization, tourism, IT and infrastructure development through public-private partnerships. He highlighted forthcoming laws and commissions aimed at enhancing market access, fostering trade and investment and ensuring the competitiveness of Sri Lankas economy. President Wickremesinghe reassured foreign investors by mentioning the removal of restrictions and the ongoing commitment to economic reforms. Meanwhile, sharing his perspective during the roundtable discussion on Sri Lankas undertaken reforms, Mr. Sagala Ratnayaka, the Presidents Senior Advisor on National Security and Presidential Chief of Staff, emphasized a comprehensive approach encompassing both economic and governmental facets. Mr. Ratnayaka highlighted that alongside economic reforms, the government embarked on an extensive array of changes. This included a proactive engagement in a diagnostics exercise initiated by the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Notably, the government did not wait for the completion of the IMF diagnostics exercise but initiated various measures beforehand. Initiatives like the establishment of the Parliamentary Budget Office were implemented even before the governance diagnostics report was published. Subsequent to these initial steps, a comprehensive program was launched to implement diagnostic reforms. Mr. Ratnayaka underscored the significance of introducing critical legislation, such as the anti-corruption law. He explained the process by which the Constitutional Council would recommend commissioners for the Anti-Corruption Commission to the President. Emphasizing a forward-looking approach, Mr. Ratnayaka affirmed that all undertaken actions aim to elevate international standards. The Senior Advisor highlighted the introduction of a substantial number of pieces of legislation on the governance front, with approximately 20 already completed. Looking ahead, the focus includes labour laws, with a target of 40 or 50 new laws and the consolidation of around 40 to 50 existing legislations into a modern, forward-looking framework. The overarching goal is to create a favourable environment for employers and align Sri Lanka with contemporary global standards. The Business Roundtable provided a platform for Sri Lanka to showcase its economic resilience and commitment to growth, leaving attendees optimistic about the nations future prospects. Representing the Sri Lankan business community at this Business Roundtable were Mr. Krishan Balendra  Chairman John Keels Holdings, Mr. Sanath Manatunge  CEOMD Commercial Bank PLC, Mr. Dilshan Wirasekara  Chairman Colombo Stock Exchange, Mr. Prakash Schaffter  Deputy Chairman Janashakthi Insurance PLC, Mr. Keith Bernard  Chairman, Sri Lanka Ports Authority, Ms. Stasshani Jayawardena  Joint Deputy ChairmanMD, Aitken Spence PLC, Mr. Sanjeev Gardiner  Chairman Galle Face Group, Mr. Ashok Pathirage  Chairman Sri Lankan Airlines, Mr. Sujeewa Rajapakse  Chairman Peoples Bank, Dr. Parakrama Dissanayake  Deputy Chairman  Managing Director, Aitken Spence PLC and  Mr. Supun Weerasinghe  CEO Daialog Axiata.

Furthermore, the ministry has previously instructed licensed recruitment companies and offices to establish upper limits for the costs of recruiting domestic workers from specific nationalities. The set upper limit for recruiting domestic workers from Sierra Leone and Burundi is SR7,500, and SR10,000 from Thailand, exclusive of the value-added tax (VAT). The decision aligns with the ministrys broader goals to develop all services, improve the labour market environment and enhance its appeal, according to the ministry. It reflects the ministrys commitment to periodically reviewing costs, services, and systems in response to economic changes, ensuring they are appropriately aligned. The ministry also emphasized the importance of adherence to these new price ceilings and stated that compliance would be monitored through the Musaned platform. This initiative highlights the ministrys dedication to creating a balanced and fair recruitment environment in the kingdom. Source: Gulf News -Agencies",

        "date": "January 16, 2024 09:29 pm",
        "content": "Disruptions to Red Sea shipping caused by Houthi attacks will push up prices of consumer goods, an executive from port and freight operator DP World said on Tuesday as a missile struck another vessel in the region. The Iran-allied Houthi militia has threatened to expand its attacks to include U.S. ships in response to American and British strikes on its sites in Yemen. Attacks by the Houthis on ships in the region since November have impacted companies and alarmed major powers - an escalation of Israels more than three-month-old war with Palestinian Hamas militants in Gaza. The Houthis say they are acting in solidarity with Palestinians. DP World CFO Yuvraj Narayan said he expected disruptions to hit European consumers hardest. The cost of goods into Europe from Asia will be significantly higher, Narayan told Reuters at the annual World Economic Forum meeting in Davos, Switzerland. European consumers will feel the pain ... It will hit developed economies more than it will hit developing economies, the Dubai-based logistics companys finance chief added. Two heads of international banking groups said privately in Davos they were worried the crisis might cause inflationary pressures which could ultimately delay or reverse interest rate cuts and jeopardise hopes for a U.S. economic soft landing. The impact on business is growing. War risk insurance premiums for shipments through the Red Sea are rising, insurance sources said on Tuesday. In Spain, four factories owned by French tyre maker Michelin are planning to halt output again this weekend due to delays in the delivery of raw materials. SHIP HIT A Malta-flagged, Greek-owned bulk carrier was targeted and hit by a missile while northbound in the Red Sea 76 nautical miles northwest of the Yemeni port of Saleef, a security firm and two Greek shipping ministry sources said on Tuesday. The vessel, the Zografia, was sailing from Vietnam to Israel with 24 crew on board and was empty of cargo when attacked, one of the Greek sources said. There were no injuries, only material damage, the source added. It was still sailing but would probably reroute for safety checks. Underlining concerns, Japanese shipping operator Nippon Yusen (9101.T), opens new tab, also known as NYK Line, instructed its vessels navigating near the Red Sea to wait in safe waters and is considering route changes, a company spokesperson said. Shipping giant Maersk (MAERSKb.CO), opens new tab, however, sent two container ships through the Red Sea carrying goods for the U.S. military and government. GAZA CEASEFIRE CALL Container vessels have been pausing or diverting from the Red Sea that leads to the Suez Canal, the fastest freight route from Asia to Europe. Many ships have been forced to circumnavigate South Africas Cape of Good Hope instead. British oil major Shell (SHEL.L), opens new tab has suspended all shipments through the Red Sea indefinitely after the U.S. and UK strikes triggered fears of further escalation, the Wall Street Journal reported on Tuesday. Shell declined to comment. Russian tanker group Sovcomflot (FLOT.MM), opens new tab is also considering alternative routes in case the crisis escalates, TASS news agency reported. Sovcomflot did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. European diplomats said member states of the European Union had given initial backing to creation of a naval mission by Feb. 19 to help protect ships from Houthi attacks in the Red Sea. The existing U.S.-led coalition meant to safeguard commercial traffic in the Red Sea is weak because regional powerhouses Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Egypt have not taken part, Yemens vice president said on Tuesday. This Bab al-Mandab corridor is of interest to the whole world and to the region, so regional intervention is key, Aidarous al-Zubaidi told Reuters in an interview, referring to the narrow strait at the southern entrance to the Red Sea. Zubaidis separatist Southern Transitional Council is part of an alliance that opposes the Houthis in Yemen. Saudi Arabias foreign minister underline the link between Houthi attacks on commercial ships to the war in Gaza. Prince Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud said the kingdoms priority is finding a path to de-escalation through a ceasefire in Gaza. Also speaking in Davos, Chinese Premier Li Qiang said it was important to keep global supply chains stable and smooth.

        "content": "(Reuters) - Qatar and France have brokered a deal with Israel and Palestinian Islamist group Hamas to deliver urgent medication to some 45 Israeli hostages held by the group in Gaza in return for humanitarian and medical aid for the most vulnerable civilians. The two countries said the aid would leave Qatar for Egypt on Wednesday before being taken across the Rafah border crossing. Qatari foreign ministry spokesperson Majed al-Ansari said in a statement the deal would mean medicine along with other humanitarian aid is to be delivered to civilians in the Gaza Strip, in the most affected and vulnerable areas, in exchange for delivering medication needed for Israeli captives in Gaza. He did not give details on how much aid or what aid would be delivered to civilians. The office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said two Qatari Air Force planes were to land on Wednesday in Egypt with medicines purchased in France based on an Israeli list. Earlier, Philippe Lalliot, head of Frances foreign ministry crisis centre which organises aid efforts, said negotiations had been going on for weeks and the initial idea had come from the families of some of the Israeli hostages. Specific medical packages for several months, which were put together in France, would be delivered to each of the 45 hostages. The International Committee of the Red Cross will coordinate on the ground. France still has three nationals held in Gaza, but none of them are in urgent need of medication, Lalliot said.

        "date": "January 17, 2024 08:28 am",
        "content": "Sri Lankas Colombo port has seen a big jump in container volumes in recent weeks as vessels steering clear of tensions in the southern Red Sea have found it a convenient transit point, officials said on Tuesday. Yemens Iran-backed Houthi rebels have since November attacked ships in the Red Sea, part of a route that accounts for about 12 of the worlds shipping traffic, in what they say is an effort to support Palestinians in the war with Israel. In response, some shipping companies have instructed vessels to sail around Africas Cape of Good Hope, a slower and more expensive route. Due to Colombos strategic location, stopping at the port gives ships convenient access to the Middle East, South Asia and East Asia, said Lal Weerasinghe, a senior official at the Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA). When ships come past South Africa, Colombo is the first hub they meet...Singapore is further away. So this is the easiest port to access, Weerasinghe said. Port of Colombo is a key port between Africa, the Middle East and East Asia and handled 6.94 million 20-foot equivalent unit (TEU) in 2023, a 2 jump for the year, SLPA data showed. In December, TEUs jumped 15 on year. Over the last four to six weeks, shipping lines requested more berthing windows at the ports three terminals and transhipment volumes from neighbouring India also grew, two terminal operators said. We typically handle about 5,000-5,500 TEUs (per day) but since late last year there has been an increase of about 1,000 TEUs per day, said Weerasinghe. We were forced to decline requests from about four shipping lines to increase traffic because it would cause delays for existing customers. As much as 50 of the uptick is from Mediterranean Shipping Company, the leading container shipping company, Weerasinghe added. Shipping companies are also increasingly using Colombo as a relaying port, sometimes offloading their entire cargo to a different ship, he added. Vessel calls have risen at other Colombo port terminals too. There is a lot of transhipment from India. We are hoping increased traffic will help Colombo port edge closer to double-digit growth in the first quarter, said an official from a privately-run terminal. He declined to be named as he is not authorised to speak to the media. Source: Reuters -Agencies",

        "date": "January 17, 2024 11:39 am",
        "content": "Chinas population dropped by 2 million people in 2023 in the second straight annual drop as births fell and deaths jumped after the lifting of COVID-19 restrictions, the government said Wednesday. The number of deaths more than doubled to 690,000. Demographers were expecting a sharp rise in deaths because of COVID-19 outbreaks that started at the end of the previous year and continued through February of last year. The total population stood at 1.4 billion, the statistics bureau said. China, long the most populated country in the world, dropped into second place behind India in 2023, according to U.N. estimates. The number of births fell for the seventh year, reflecting a fall in the birth rate that is a long-running economic and societal challenge for China. The population is aging steadily, which could slow economic growth over time and challenge the nations ability to provide for a larger elderly population with fewer workers. The number of births fell by 540,000, which was less than in previous years. About 9 million babies were born in 2023, half of the total in 2016. All the figures are estimates based on surveys and do not include Hong Kong and Macao. China conducts a full census every 10 years. China, which once sought to control population growth with its one-child policy, is now facing the opposite problem. The government has sought to encourage births since easing the policy over 2015 to 2016 to allow a second child and then a third child in 2021, but with little success. People are marrying later and sometimes choosing not to have children. Even those that do often have only one child because of the high cost of educating children in cities in a highly competitive academic environment. The population of women of child-bearing age has also fallen. The working-age population, defined as those between 16 and 59 years old, fell to 61 of the total population, continuing a gradual decline. The proportion of those aged 60 and older ticked up to 21. The official retirement age in China is 60 years old for men and 50 or 55 for women. It is not clear how many people died from COVID-19 because of the sudden end to Chinas zero-COVID restrictions in December 2022. The government has reported about 80,000 COVID-related deaths from December to February but experts believe it is much higher. Studies have estimated it could have reached 1.4 million or 1.9 million deaths. The drop in population is expected to be less this year, because of the waning effects of the pandemic and the fact that it is the year of the dragon, considered an auspicious year to have children, an expert said at a forum earlier this week, according to the China Daily, an English-language state-owned newspaper. But Yuan Xin, a professor at Nankai University and vice-president of the China Population Association, added that the downward trend in Chinas total population is bound to be long-term and become an inherent characteristic.

        "date": "January 17, 2024 01:07 pm",
        "content": "Apple now has the lions share of the global smartphone market, knocking Samsung off the top spot for the first time in 12 years. The American phone giant accounted for more than a fifth of phones shipped last year, according to data from the International Data Corporation (IDC). Samsung took 19.4 of the market share with Chinese phonemakers Xiaomi, OPPO and Transsion following behind. Smartphone sales have been faltering as many people upgraded in the pandemic. The IDC reports that almost 1.2 billion smartphones were sold last year - a drop of more than 3 on the previous year. It is the lowest amount sold in a decade, with many consumers tightening their purse strings in the face of economic challenges and high interest rates. Experts predict the market will recover this year. Apples rise Still, the IDC said Apple - which sold more than 234 million phones last year - is the biggest winner. Not only is Apple the only player in the Top 3 to show positive growth annually, but also bags the number 1 spot annually for the first time ever, said the IDCs Nabila Popal. All this despite facing increased regulatory challenges and renewed competition from Huawei in China, its largest market. Huawei has recently made strides in making its own chips, after being banned from buying chips that were made using US technology over claims the company poses a national security risk to Washington. Offers to trade in old models as well as interest-free financing plans are also driving demand for premium devices like Apple. Samsung slump Its disappointing news for Samsung which - until now - had the top spot as the worlds largest maker of memory chips, smartphones and televisions. Recently, the South Korean electronics giant warned its profits would drop more than expected as global demand for consumer electronics remains weak. It is also facing competition from cheaper Android models including Transsion and Xiaomi which are getting a boost from both price-savvy consumers and emerging markets. The IDC also said the smartphone market is entering a very interesting time, with a growing number of Android-providers splintering the market and customers increasingly prioritising foldable phones and AI capabilities.

        "content": "Presidents Secretary Mr. Saman Ekanayake underscored the pivotal role of education in shaping the lives of children, emphasizing that it is the sole pathway to their success. He highlighted that the successful completion of education leads to the formation of informed citizens, directly impacting the overall success of the nation. Presidents Secretary, Mr. Saman Ekanayake, made this statement during his participation in the ceremony held recently to inaugurate the provision of a fully equipped library to Konkadawala Vidyalaya, Navagaththegama. These remarks were expressed during Mr. Ekanayakes participation in a ceremony, where a fully equipped library was provided to Konkadawala Vidyalaya, Navagaththegama. With the guidance of Presidents Secretary Mr. Saman Ekanayake and the support of Chinese financial assistance, two fully equipped libraries were established at Konkadawala Vidyalaya, Navagaththegama, and Duwa Junior College, Negombo, facilitated by the intervention of the Presidents Office. Each library, costing Rs. 02 million, is stocked with essential books for students ranging from grade 6 to grade 11. The primary aim of this initiative is to assist rural students facing economic challenges, fostering a future generation enriched with knowledge. During his speech, Mr. Ekanayake shared that the idea of providing libraries to these schools stemmed from a conversation with the Chinese Deputy Ambassador to Sri Lanka, who expressed the possibility of supporting a Rs. 04 million project. He selected two schools, reflecting on the potential impact these libraries could have on the education of children attending these institutions over the next decade. Mr. Ekanayake, drawing from his own experiences of receiving primary education in a similar small school, emphasized the importance of supporting these childrens education to pave the way for their future. He shared a poignant story about the Chinese Deputy Ambassadors father. To the best of my knowledge, the father of the present Chinese Deputy Ambassador, who is in attendance today, worked as a farmer. In the eighth grade, the Chinese Deputy Ambassadors father insisted that he join in planting activities, leading to significant back pain after an hour of labour. Upon sharing this discomfort with his father, the advice given was, If you dont excel in your studies, you may find yourself compelled to engage in this occupation. Embracing that valuable lesson, the Deputy Ambassador has risen to the position of Deputy Ambassador today, operating on an international stage. This success underscores the vital message that children should internalize  education stands as the sole means to triumph in life. It is imperative to recognize that, without education, the future holds uncertainties not just for the individual children but also for the prosperity of the entire nation. The event was attended by State Minister Arundika Fernando, Member of Parliament Dr. Kavinda Jayawardene, Chinese Deputy Ambassador to Sri Lanka YANWAI ZHU, officials from the Ministry of Education, Principals, teaching staff, parents and a group of students.",

        "date": "January 17, 2024 03:53 pm",
        "content": "A Chinese company has developed a new nuclear battery that could keep your phone running for 50 years without charging. Betavolt Technology claims to have successfully miniaturized atomic energy batteries, which measure less than a coin at 15 x 15 x 5mm. The compact battery uses the radioactive isotope Nickel 63 to generate 100 microwatts and a voltage of 3V of electricity through the process of radioactive decay. The battery is currently in the pilot testing stage and Betavolt plans to mass-produce them for commercial devices like phones and drones, but also states nuclear batteries could be used for aerospace equipment, AI, medical equipment, advanced sensors, and micro-robots. The Beijing-based company claims to have drawn inspiration from devices such as pacemakers, and satellites. Betavolt is planning to boost its tech to produce a 1-watt battery by 2025. And while it still has some way to go, the company seems confident stating development is way ahead of European and American scientific research institutions and enterprises. Tiny nuclear batteries This technology could revolutionize electronics by removing the need for chargers or portable power banks altogether creating devices that run continuously and whose batteries do not degrade in terms of capacity and lifespan over charging cycles in the way Li-ion batteries do. It could even prove to be safer too, as Betavolt states that the BV100 will not catch fire or explode in response to punctures or even gunshots, unlike some current batteries that can be unsafe if damaged or when exposed to high temperatures. Such unlimited power could provide drones that fly continuously, phones that run constantly, and electric cars that dont require recharging. Currently nuclear batteries are used for spacecraft, underwater systems, automated scientific stations as well as crafts like the Mars rover, but they are large, heavy, and generate a lot of heat, while being expensive. However, Betavolt states that it uses a different approach. How Betavolts radioactive battery works To create the radioactive battery, Betavolts scientist used nickel-63, which is a radiactive element, as the energy source and then diamond semiconductors as energy converters. The team developed a single-crystal diamond semiconductor that is just 10 microns thick, and then placed a 2-micron-thick nickel-63 sheet between two diamond semiconductor converters. The decay energy of the radioactive source is then converted into an electrical current. Betavolt claims the advantages of its atomic energy batteries are their lightweight, feature a long service life, as well as feature high energy density, and can work normally under extreme temperatures from -60 to 120-degrees Celcius. Due to the modular design multiple atomic batteries could be connected to provide a higher energy output that could power automotive technology, as well as AI systems just to name a few. Toxic reputation Understandably most people wouldnt want to carry nuclear material in their pocket; particular not viewers of HBOs fantastic but chilling Chernobyl series. Many could be hesitant to adopt the widespread use of nuclear batteries due to the negative connotations of nuclear tragedies like the Chernobyl disaster in 1986 or the Fukushima nuclear accident in 2011. However, the Betavolt also addressed the concerns about radiation, stating the battery is safe as it has no external radiation and is suitable for use in medical devices inside the human body like pacemakers and cochlea implants. Betavolt says that after it has decayed the 63 nuclear isotopes become copper, which would be non-radioactive and not cause any environmental threat. While it sounds like something from 1950s science fiction this technology could change the face of electronics by providing unwired, always-on devices that could be spell a new revolution in nuclear energy use.

        "content": "President of the Inter-Company Employees Union Wasantha Samarasinghe has filed a Fundamental Rights (FR) petition before the Supreme Court, seeking a court order declaring that certain provisions of the proposed Ant-Terrorism Bill are unconstitutional. Naming the Attorney General as the respondent in his petition, the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) politburo member claimed that the Bill, presented to the Parliament by Justice Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe, allowed for the unwarranted arrest and detention of persons by the Sri Lanka Police, Army and the Coast Guard, even in the absence of a reasonable cause. He explained that this violated numerous constitutional fundamental rights, such as the right to freedom of expression and the right to freedom. Samarasinghe therefore states that if the proposed Bill were to be passed, it must be approved by a two-thirds majority in Parliament, followed by a referendum. The proposed Anti-Terrorism Bill, which will replace the current Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA) was presented before the Parliament on 10 January, by Justice Minister Rajapakshe. On 05 September 2023, the Cabinet of Ministers granted approval to publish the Anti-Terrorism Bill, which was revised in accordance with the suggestions and opinions received by different parties in the government gazette, and to table the bill in parliament for passing. Although the original draft bill had been published in the government gazette on 22 March 2023, it was later revised and re-drafted in consideration of all the opinions and suggestions received by the Ministry of Justice by various interested parties in this regard both locally and internationally.",

        "content": "The Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka (HRCSL) has made five key recommendations pertaining to the Bill on the Commission for Truth, Unity and Reconciliation in Sri Lanka, which was published by way of gazette notification on 29 December 2023. In a letter addressed to the President, the HRCSL recognized the well-established human right to truth under international law, emphasizing its crucial role in transitional justice. However, it asserted that the promotion of this right should be aligned with the advancement of other transitional justice pillars, including accountability, reparations, and preventing the recurrence of past injustices. Accordingly, the HRCSL made the following five key recommendations: 1) Without delay, a high-level committee should be set up under the Presidential Secretariat, comprising pertinent experts and representatives from victim groups and civil society. The primary responsibility of this committee is to oversee the implementation of all positive recommendations from prior truth-seeking mechanisms, including the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission (LLRC). 2) Programmes that inform the country as a whole about the findings of previous truth-seeking mechanisms should be carried out. 3) Establish a strong, impartial entity for investigating and prosecuting serious human rights violations and crimes, promptly providing it with essential resources and access to expertise, including international perspectives as needed. 4) Transitional justice in Sri Lanka should address both armed conflicts and civil disturbances, including insurrections, delving into their political and socioeconomic roots for a holistic national reckoning. 5) The Presidential Secretariat should serve as the host for any transitional justice mechanism in Sri Lanka, providing it with the utmost status and significance.

        "title": "WHO declares Sri Lanka has achieved Hepatitis B control",
        "date": "January 17, 2024 07:07 pm",
        "content": "In a significant milestone, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared on Wednesday that both Sri Lanka and Maldives have successfully achieved control over the deadly hepatitis B disease. This comes after an expert panel verified that the two countries have had consistently high coverage of Hepatitis B vaccine doses in infants and a low prevalence of the deadly disease, corroborated through serological surveys conducted recently in both countries. I congratulate and commend the Maldives and Sri Lanka on their achievement which once again demonstrates the earnest efforts being made by the health leaders and officials, health workers and the people of these countries towards the health and well-being of communities, Dr Poonam Khetrapal Singh, Regional Director, WHO South-East Asia said. The Expert Panel for Verification of Hepatitis B Control in WHO South-East Asia Region reviewed childhood immunisation data from the Maldives and Sri Lanka that showed consistent over 90 per cent coverage with Hepatitis B vaccine doses provided during infancy for the past many years. The experts also reviewed the findings of national surveys conducted among children in 2022-2023, in these countries. Based on the evidence presented to it, the Expert Panel concluded that the standards required for verification of hepatitis B control have been met in both these countries and hence recommended that this important public health target has been achieved in Maldives and Sri Lanka, said Dr Supamit Chunsuttiwat, chairperson of the Regional Expert Panel for verification of hepatitis B control in Southeast Asia. Notably, the two countries join Bangladesh, Bhutan, Nepal and Thailand, who achieved the same feat in 2019, WHO stated in the release. Preventing hepatitis B infection in infancy substantially reduces chronic infections and cases of liver cancer and cirrhosis in adulthood. Meanwhile, hepatitis control continues to be an important public health initiative in the Southeast Asia Region of WHO, which comprises 11 countries and is home to a quarter of the worlds population. The region has an estimated 60 million people living with chronic hepatitis B and 2,18,000 people dying every year of hepatitis B and C. Of the people eligible for antiviral treatment, only about 10 per cent know their status and less than 5 per cent of them are on treatment. In 2016, the South-East Asia Regional Immunization Technical Advisory Group endorsed a regional goal of hepatitis B control with a target of reducing hepatitis B prevalence to less than 1 per cent among children aged at least 5 years. Hepatitis B vaccine, as a part of the pentavalent vaccine, has been included in the national childhood immunisation schedule of all countries of the Region, with three doses of this vaccine provided to children during their first year of life. Eight countries of the Region also have a policy of providing a birth dose of the Hepatitis B vaccine to newborn babies. According to WHO, the region made good progress in improving immunisation coverage of the pentavalent vaccine until 2019. However, there was a decline in coverage in several countries of the Region in 2020 and 2021 following the COVID-19 pandemic.  Intensive efforts in countries have resulted in the revival of childhood immunization coverage to pre-pandemic levels in several countries and the WHO and UNICEF estimates for 2022 show that the overall coverage of 3rd dose of pentavalent vaccine has recovered to the pre-pandemic level of 91 per cent in the region, a sharp increase from 82 per cent coverage level reported in 2021. Dr Khetrapal Singh further stressed that countries also need to focus on improving the Hepatitis B vaccine birth dose, which continues to have a relatively slow uptake with an estimated coverage of only 58 per cent in the region in 2022. She said that one of the key barriers to achieving high hepatitis B vaccine birth dose coverage remains the high proportion of home deliveries, that do not allow timely access of the Hepatitis B vaccine to these newborns. The Regional Director further added that inequities in immunisation service delivery, suboptimal awareness and training of health staff at birthing facilities, particularly in terms of false contraindications and fear of adverse events following immunisation, also contribute to sub-optimal coverage of Hepatitis B vaccination coverage. The control of hepatitis B through immunisation is a priority for our region. Achieving the control goal is a critical step as we progress towards the elimination of mother-to-child transmission of the hepatitis B virus, the Regional Director said. WHOs triple elimination initiative encourages countries to simultaneously commit to such elimination together with HIV and syphilis - further pushing the agenda for integrated service delivery. Hepatitis must be prevented and treated. In addition to vaccination, continued efforts are needed to scale up other preventive measures such as safe injection, safe blood and infection prevention and control, Dr Khetarapal Singh added.

        "title": "Sri Lankan President backs debt relief for Africa",
        "date": "January 17, 2024 07:16 pm",
        "content": "Sri Lanka is expecting an economic growth of 2 in 2024, which is likely to further increase to 4 or 5 in 2025, says President Ranil Wickremesinghe. The Head of State made these remarks on Wednesday while speaking during a panel discussion on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. Responding to a question pertaining to his stance on debt relief, President Wickremesinghe acknowledged that while it is evident that Sri Lanka has performed well in terms of its agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), concerns still remain as to how they will repay the total amount. But as I mentioned, the main issue we have is, how do you repay this? Because weve had a Balance of Payments issue, and secondly, we have a question of budgetary issues also, revenue is not enough for the expenditure, he said in this regard. Speaking in the context of increasing the revenue earned by the government, however, President Wickremesinghe stated that together with the IMF, Sri Lanka is increasing revenue, and is revamping the countrys total revenue collection systems. Were increasing revenue, and as growth comes in, there should be more revenue, he assured. The President also unveiled that plans are underway to establish a revenue authority, replacing the individual departments currently existing. Meanwhile, Sri Lankas President and Minister of Finance explained that as far as it is concerned, the countrys Balance of Payments depends on the mechanisms employed to attract new investments, and how fruitful said mechanisms are. Speaking with regards to the short term plan currently in place to improve Sri Lankas Balance of Payments, President Wickremesinghe revealed that tourism, agricultural modernization and renewable energy are the sectors currently being focused on with regards to attracting investments. We have a fair amount of solar and wind power far beyond our needs, and we are also going to sell parts of it to India, he explained further. Despite these efforts, however, President Wickremesinghe highlighted that there still remain pressing concerns, including populism. The expectations of people have to be metand most of us are living beyond our means, if you look at in a conventional way. Then, your bond markets, and other, are, at the moment, operating on the conventional rules, he said, questioning how both, meeting the expectations of the people, and doing so in a conventional manner, can run in tandem. Now how do you have these two together? If youre going to apply the strict rules, all governments will collapse, President Wickremesinghe warned. Thus, he highlighted the importance of governments having an individual stance and plan in this regard, in relation to their respective countries, adding that if not, the issue is one that would pertain. Your government must, at the end of the day, provide the minimum facility that is expected, he said. Talking about Sri Lankas stance in this regard, President Ranil acknowledged that Sri Lanka does not have it as bad as certain other countries, such as Africa, who is currently suffering from an extensive debt crisis. Its not so bad for us, we got into this problem because we took loans on non-tradable goods, no way of paying back, but all our villages today, have paved roads and better buildings in schools. At the end of it, I can still say part of it will help us for social development, the President said in this regard. Speaking with regards to the current crisis faced by the African countries, President Wickremesinghe highlighted that comparisons cannot be drawn between the two countries, emphasising that Africa is in dire need of the debt relief package. Just because we can handle it, doesnt mean that African countries can handle it. We are for debt relief for Africa, President Wickremesinghe emphasised.

        "content": "State Minister for Transport Lasantha Alagiyawanna has assured that the ongoing issue in the issuance of drivers licenses would be addressed by October, with a shift towards providing permanent licenses through a one-day service rather than temporary ones. Speaking at a news conference held at the Presidential Media Centre under the theme Collective Path to a stable country today (Jan.17), the state minister outlined plans to elevate all district offices responsible for issuing driving licenses to the status of the head office in Werahera by the end of this year. Alagiyawanna, elaborating on the transportation initiatives under President Ranil Wickremesinghes guidance, emphasized the ministrys commitment to delivering efficient public transport services through modern technology. He highlighted the ongoing programs and the ministrys efforts to amend the existing motor vehicle act, introducing a new act. In the interest of road safety, steps are being taken to streamline the speed limit process to reduce accidents. While alcohol detection is currently operational for drivers, a new initiative targets legal action against drivers under the influence of drugs, implemented nationwide since this year, with an initial phase in the Western and Southern Provinces. To enhance driver education and safety, plans are afoot to implement a program to inform drivers about first aid in the event of an accident, with future intentions to incorporate related questions into the drivers license test. With approximately 8.9 million vehicles and 8.5 million licensed drivers in the country, efforts are underway to standardize all district offices issuing licenses to the level of the Werahera head office by year-end. Further developments include facilitating drivers licenses for foreigners at airports by April and resolving the current challenges in license issuance by October. The commitment extends to replacing temporary licenses with permanent ones through expedited one-day services. --PMD",

        "date": "January 18, 2024 09:04 am",
        "content": "UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak survived a key test of his leadership Wednesday, fending off right-wing rebels to win a crunch parliamentary vote on his contentious plan to send migrants to Rwanda. Sunak, in power since October 2022, has staked his political future on the scheme, as Britain gears up for its next general election later this year. Right-wing Conservatives had threatened to kill the Safety of Rwanda (Asylum and Immigration) Bill, but they ultimately backed down and the government won comfortably by 320 votes to 276. The result means Sunak avoids a serious weakening of his authority, as his faction-ridden party desperately needs to claw back support from the main opposition Labour party before the nationwide vote. The bill is the British leaders answer to a UK Supreme Court ruling late last year that deporting asylum seekers to Kigali is illegal under international law. The latest legislation, if passed, would compel judges to treat Rwanda as a safe third country. It would also give UK ministers powers to disregard sections of international and British human rights legislation. While the bill cleared its third and final hurdle in the elected House of Commons, it will need to be approved by the unelected upper chamber House of Lords before it becomes law. The government does not hold a majority in the Lords, where members are likely to scrutinise the proposals and propose a number of amendments, setting up another battle with Downing Street. The legislation could also still be blocked by legal challenges, drawing out the long-running saga -- dubbed a farce and a gimmick by Labour -- even further. London has already paid Kigali 240 million (280 million euros) since ex-prime minister Boris Johnson first announced the plan in April 2022. Sunak has pledged to slash record levels of regular migration and stop asylum seekers crossing from France to Britain in small boats. He insists the Rwanda bill is essential to deter migrants from considering travelling to the United Kingdom via unauthorised routes. Polls But the proposal has reopened splits between right-wingers and moderates in the ruling party not seen since the wranglings over what Brexit should look like following the 2016 EU referendum. Several dozen Tory lawmakers backed unsuccessful amendments that sought to toughen the scheme, including by disapplying international law and restricting migrants right to appeal deportation. Two deputy chairmen resigned their roles in support of the tweaks, which received the vocal support of Johnson, who is no longer an MP and not able to vote. Sunak refused to bow to rebel demands though because doing so would almost certainly have seen the bill scuppered by moderates, who say the legislation already pushes at the margins of acceptability. In a bid to quell the dissent, Sunaks government announced that it would hire new judges to create thousands of additional sittings to fast-track cases to the courts. His illegal migration minister also appeared to suggest that ministers would have the power to force civil servants to ignore last-minute injunctions from the European Court of Human Rights. Sunak also faced down rebels during the first vote on the bill in December. Around 30,000 asylum seekers crossed the English Channel on rudimentary vessels last year. Five died trying to make the journey this past weekend. Hundreds were picked up from the freezing waters and brought ashore on Wednesday, an AFP photographer in the south coast port of Dover saw. Sunak has yet to announce the date of the election but has said it will be held this year. Some opinion polls put Labour 20 points ahead of the Tories, suggesting the governing party is heading for a landslide defeat. The Conservatives have ruled since 2010, when Labour was last in power. Sunak, in power since October 2022, has staked his political future on the scheme, as Britain gears up for its next general election later this year. Source: AFP -Agencies",

Among them are 63,150 domestic consumers and 17,820 non-domestic consumers. It is reported that the NWSDB has to recover Rs. 1,909 million in arrears from the consumers whose water supply was disconnected and outstanding payments amounting to Rs. 6,118 million from the consumers whose water supply is yet to be disconnected. This include Rs. 182 million in arrears from hospitals, Rs. 175 million from schools, Rs. 116 million from the Sri Lanka Army and the police.

        "date": "January 18, 2024 11:31 am",
        "content": "An American woman who helped kill her mother and stuff her body in a suitcase during a 2014 holiday in Bali has been sentenced to 26 years in prison. Heather Mack was convicted in Indonesia in 2015 and sentenced to 10 years in prison, but was released in 2021. She was then arrested upon arriving in the US and charged with conspiracy to kill a US national. Mack has spent the last two years in a Chicago prison as she awaited sentencing. On Wednesday, Judge Matthew Kennelly ruled that Mack, 28, will receive credit for the time she has served thus far, reducing her formal sentence to around 23 years. Prosecutors had recommended a 28-year prison sentence for Mack, who conspired with her then-boyfriend Tommy Schaefer to kill her mother, wealthy academic Sheila von Wiese-Mack. The pair reportedly did so to gain access to a 1.5m (1.17m) trust fund. Prosecutors alleged that Ms Mack - who was 18 at the time of the murder and pregnant - covered her mothers mouth while Mr Schaefer struck her in the head with a fruit bowl. The body was later discovered stuffed inside a suitcase. After Wiese-Macks murder at the hotel, Ms Mack and Mr Schaefer left the suitcase with her remains in the boot of a taxi, prosecutors said. The driver later alerted police. The couple was later discovered staying at another hotel in Bali. Mack originally pleaded not-guilty to the US charges, but had changed her plea after a good deal was offered to her by prosecutors, who originally sought a longer sentence. During her sentencing, Wiese-Macks brother Bill Wiese asked the court to impose the maximum penalty possible, arguing that Mack has not shown remorse for the crime. If it were up to me, Heather would spend the rest of her life behind bars, Mr Wiese said. Mr Schaefer, who is also named in the US indictment, remains imprisoned in Indonesia. Source: BBC -Agencies",

        "date": "January 18, 2024 12:25 pm",
        "content": "Pakistan says its has launched missile strikes into neighbouring Iran, two days after an Iranian attack inflamed relations between the two states. Pakistan said the attacks had struck terrorist hideouts in the bordering Sistan-o-Balochistan province. Iranian media reported that three women and four children had been killed. The two have long accused each other of harbouring militant groups that carry out attacks in their border regions. On Wednesday evening, Iranian media reported that several explosions were heard near the border with Pakistan, around the city of Saravan. Pakistans Ministry of Foreign Affairs confirmed the strikes in a statement, and said that a number of terrorists were killed during the Intelligence-based operation. Pakistans military action comes after it fiercely condemned Irans strike on Tuesday, which it said killed two children. Iran said its strikes were aimed at a Pakistan-based insurgent group, but Pakistan said civilians were killed It had warned Tehran of serious consequences for the illegal action and banned Irans ambassador from returning to the country and also withdrew its own envoy from Pakistan. Iran insisted its strikes were aimed only at Jaish al-Adl, which it labels a terrorist group, and not Pakistans citizens. However its neighbour to the east was outraged by the action. Pakistan said it had occurred despite the existence of several channels of communication. On Thursday, Pakistan defended its own strikes into Iranian territory, saying its actions were only aimed at the terrorists known as Sarmachars. This action is a manifestation of Pakistans unflinching resolve to protect and defend its national security against all threats, the foreign ministry said. Pakistan said it fully respects Irans sovereignty and territorial integrity and the the sole objective of todays act was in pursuit of Pakistans own security and national interest which is paramount and cannot be compromised.

        "title": "Chinas ageing population threatens switch to new economic growth model",
        "date": "January 18, 2024 12:32 pm",
        "content": "Chinas ageing population threatens key Beijing policy goals for the coming decade of boosting domestic consumption and reining in ballooning debt, posing a severe challenge to the economys long-term growth prospects. A record low birth rate in 2023 and a wave of COVID-19 deaths resulted in a second consecutive year of population decline, accelerating concerns about Chinas demographic downturn. Large groups of the 1.4 billion people living in the worlds second-largest economy will exit the labour pool and age past a prime period of their lives for consumption, exacerbating structural imbalances that policymakers have vowed to address. Household consumptions share of economic output in China is already one of the lowest in the world, while many provincial governments - responsible for pensions and elderly care - are deep in debt as a result of decades of credit-fuelled investment-driven growth. Chinas age structure change will slow down economic growth, said Xiujian Peng, senior research fellow at the Centre of Policy Studies (CoPS) at Victoria University in Melbourne. In the next 10 years, about 300 million people currently aged 50 to 60 - Chinas largest demographic group, equivalent to almost the entire U.S. population - are set to leave the workforce at a time when pension budgets are already stretched. The state-run Chinese Academy of Sciences sees the pension system running out of money by 2035, with about a third of the countrys provincial-level jurisdictions running pension budget deficits, according to finance ministry data. LOW RETIREMENT AGE China, which accepts few and only highly-skilled foreign workers, has one of the worlds lowest retirement ages, at 60 for men, 55 for white-collar women and 50 for women who work in factories. A record 28 million people are scheduled to retire this year. Employees at state-owned companies are typically mandated to retire when of age, while private employers rarely keep workers longer, whereas in some Western countries the retirement age is more flexible. Unemployed Li Zhulin, 50, from the northwestern Shaanxi province frets about relying solely on her husbands pension of about 5,000 to 7,000 yuan (697 to 975) per month when he retires in 2027 after a career at a state-owned company. Li has been cutting back on expenses and scouring the internet for financial planning tips to try to be less of a burden for her only daughter. In addition to supporting her own family if she marries, she would also take care of four elderly people, Li said, including the husbands parents. I cant imagine how difficult that would be. Chinese society has traditionally expected children to support their parents financially as they age and often by living together to care for them. But as in many Western countries, rapid urbanisation has shifted young people to bigger cities and away from their parents, prompting a rising number of seniors to rely on self care or government payments. Whereas five workers supported every Chinese retiree in 2020, the ratio will decline to 2.4 workers in 2035 and 1.6 in 2050, estimates University of Wisconsin-Madison demographer Yi Fuxian. By that point, Chinas pension crisis will develop into a humanitarian catastrophe, Yi said. Japans ratio was 2 to 1 in 2022 and is projected to hit 1.3 to 1 in 2070 according to its government. But Japan was already a high-income economy before its populations ageing accelerated. AGEING CONSUMERS Chinas second-largest group, about 230 million people aged 30 to 49, are in a prime period for consumption as their career is advanced enough to afford buying homes and cars and parents begin spending on child education. Once the group reaches their 50s, their children will finish schooling and start earning their own income, meaning the cohort is expected to participate less in domestic consumption. Their future replacement, currently in their 20s, is the smallest generation since the famines of the 1950s, a direct result of Chinas one-child policy from 1980 to 2015. This bodes ill for Chinas property sector, which accounted for about a quarter of its economic output before its bubble popped in 2021 due to over-leveraged developers and excess supply of apartments, drawing comparisons with Japans predicament in the 1990s before its lost decades of stagnation. Japans experience shows that as the share of the working age population declines, so does demand for housing, said Larry Hu, chief China economist at Macquarie. INNOVATION WOES China saw a rise in births after ditching the one-child policy but the recovery was far off pre-implementation levels and also short-lived. Fewer children were born in each of the past eight years, including 2023. Demographers say the number of children in any economy is directly correlated with domestic consumption. Peng at CoPS says a shrinking domestic market will increase Chinas reliance on exports. With China already producing a third of the goods consumed around the world, it has redirected credit flows from property to manufacturing, in a bid to lift industries up the value chain and avoid the middle income trap. But, Peng says, an ageing workforce means they have less incentives to innovate, and a slower, not faster, productivity improvement. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "date": "January 18, 2024 01:43 pm",
        "content": "Singapores transport minister has resigned from his post after being charged with 27 offences in a corruption probe that has also ensnared a billionaire hotel tycoon. S. Iswaran was arrested in July of 2023 and released on bail in connection with a rare top-level graft investigation in the city-state. Iswaran, 61, said he would plead not guilty to the charges filed by the powerful Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau when he appeared in court on Thursday. Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong revealed shortly after Thursdays hearing that Iswaran had submitted his resignation from the government, parliament and ruling Peoples Action Party (PAP) on January 16 after being given formal notice of the charges against him. Iswaran has also pledged to return the money received as part of his salary and allowances since his arrest, Lee said. I reject the allegations in the charges and will now focus on clearing my name, Iswaran wrote in his resignation letter, which was published on the website of the prime ministers office. Most of the charges against Iswaran relate to corruption, but he also faces one charge of obstruction of justice. Among other accusations, he is alleged to have accepted tickets to high-profile sporting events and stage shows from hotel tycoon Ong Beng Seng, one of Singapores richest people. Ong, the managing director of Hotel Properties Limited, was arrested the same day as Iswaran in 2023 and also released on bail. Ong is credited with helping bring the Formula One Grand Prix to Singapore in 2008. The Attorney-Generals Chambers (AGC) will take a decision in respect of the investigations against Mr Ong and others, after the case against Mr S Iswaran has been completed, the AGC said in a statement Thursday.  Body blow  The graft investigation has gripped Singapore, a global financial hub reputed to be among the least corrupt countries in the world. Cabinet ministers are paid salaries comparable to the top earners in the private sector to deter corruption. Iswarans corruption case was the most politically significant in Singapores history, said Eugene Tan, an associate professor of law at Singapore Management University, describing it as a body blow for the PAP. But I think the fair-minded observer will look at Singapores track record, will look at how this case has been dealt with so far, and will not come to the view that this strong anti-corruption stance is just mere talk, he said. The alleged offences date back as far as 2015. Questions remain over why they were not discovered sooner, and whether the degree of transparency and public reporting by senior officials in the Singapore system is sufficient, said Ian Chong, a political scientist at the National University of Singapore. They also raise questions about whether high pay is sufficient in discouraging corruption  people could always want more, he added. Lee has previously admitted that his long-ruling PAP had taken a hit after a spate of political scandals. In addition to Iswarans arrest last year, two PAP legislators resigned because of an affair. Before that, two heavyweight cabinet members were investigated for allegedly getting favours in their rental of sprawling colonial-era bungalows, but were subsequently cleared of any wrongdoing. Lee has faced criticism over an alleged lack of transparency in how the government handled the scandals, as well as questions over whether the standards set by the partys founding leaders have been eroded. The scandals come as the party  which has ruled uninterrupted for 64 years  bounced back from its worst ever election results in 2020, when its share of the popular vote fell and the opposition gained more seats.

        "content": "The Committee on Public Accounts (COPA) has expressed its strong displeasure for not giving a proper punishment to the Samurdhi Development officials involved in misconduct and various incidents of corruption and irregularities. This was discussed when the said committee met in Parliament recently under the Chairmanship of State Minister Lasantha Alagiyawanna. Officials from the Samurdhi Development Department affiliated to the Ministry of Women, Child Affairs and Social Empowerment had been called before the committee on this day, the Parliamentary Communications Department said. The committee inquired about the disciplinary action taken against the officials responsible for a financial irregularity in providing fishing nets to the people for livelihood in the Damana Divisional Secretariat in Ampara. Accordingly, the Ministry of Women, Child Affairs and Social Empowerment was advised to re-investigate the incident and obtain a report, expressing their displeasure with the disciplinary measures followed. Accordingly, the committee instructed the officials to take appropriate disciplinary action against the officials who engage in such misconduct from there on. The committee instructed the Samurdhi Development Department to prepare an immediate program to protect the Samurdhi beneficiaries. The Committee Chair instructed to pay more attention to the beneficiaries of Samurdhi who are not satisfied and work towards empowering them. Instructions were also given to send a report to the committee including details of the amount of money in the seven funds currently under the care of the Samurdhi Development Department and the services provided by those funds, it added. The progress of computerization of the Samurdhi Bank system was also examined during the committee meeting. Accordingly, the officials informed that currently 1,089 Samurdhi Banks have been networked. However, as all the banks are still not fully computerized, the officials were instructed to take the necessary measures to bring all the banks to operate through one system by giving a date for each bank to go through the system. The Chair stated that the approval for the new staff of Samurdhi Development Department has been received and accordingly instructed to provide a report on the tasks expected to be carried out by the Department to solve the existing issues related to the staff and also advised to hire the new employees as soon as possible.

        "title": "Japan counts down to precision moon sniper landing mission",
        "date": "January 18, 2024 03:39 pm",
        "content": "Japan aims to become the fifth country to put a spacecraft on the moon when it attempts a precision landing on Friday, in what would be a boost for a space programme that has suffered a wave of setbacks and been eclipsed by rival China. Dubbed the moon sniper, the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) probe is attempting to land within 100 metres (328 feet) of its target, a technology JAXA says is unprecedented and essential in the search for moon water and human habitability. Japan is increasingly looking to play a bigger role in space, partnering with close ally Washington to respond to Chinas military and technological might, including in space. Japan boasts a number of private-sector space startups and aims to send an astronaut to the moon as part of NASAs Artemis programme. But JAXA has faced multiple setbacks, including a launch failure in March of the new flagship rocket H3 that was meant to match cost-competitiveness against commercial rocket providers like SpaceX. JAXAs Smart Lander for Investigating Moon (SLIM) probe will start a 20-minute touchdown phase on its one-way mission from midnight on Saturday (1500 GMT Friday), trying to land on a target site roughly the size of two athletic tracks on the slope of a crater just south of the lunar equator. No other nation has achieved this. Proving Japan has this technology would bring us a huge advantage in upcoming international missions like Artemis, said Shinichiro Sakai, JAXAs SLIM project manager. Indias Chandrayaan-3 in August made a historic touchdown on the moons south pole, a major technological feat given the rough terrain, highlighting Indias rise as a major player in space. JAXA stresses its high-precision technology will become a powerful tool in future exploration of hilly moon poles, seen as a potential source of oxygen, fuel and water. Japan also plans a joint unmanned lunar polar exploration with India in 2025. For lunar project development, Japan cant beat the U.S., China or India in terms of resources, said Kazuto Saiki, a Ritsumeikan University professor who developed SLIMs near-infrared camera that will analyse moon rocks after the landing. We should focus on building sought-after technologies like the pinpoint landing and near-infrared cameras which overseas exploration projects will strive to adopt. JAXA has twice landed on small asteroids, but a moon landing is much more difficult due to its gravity, as seen in a number of recent failures. Last year, a probe belonging to Japanese startup ispace inc crashed onto the moons surface, and Russias Luna 25 followed suit. A lander from American startup Astrobotic last week suffered a fuel leak, forcing it to abandon a touchdown attempt. Mistakes happen, but Japan is a very experienced space power - its conducted very complicated space operations for many years, said Bleddyn Bowen, a University of Leicester associate professor specialising in space policy. Not as big as the United States or the Soviet Union of old or China today in terms of scale, but in terms of capability and niche advanced technologies, Japan has always been there. SLIMs precision landing wont be a game changer, but the demonstration of it and the lightweight probe manufacturing Japan has pursued might open up moonshots to space organisations worldwide by reducing the cost of each mission, Bowen added. JAXA says it will take up to a month to verify whether SLIM has achieved the high-precision goals after touchdown. On landing, SLIM will also deploy two mini-probes - a hopping vehicle as big as a microwave oven and a baseball-sized wheeled rover - that will take pictures of the spacecraft. Tech giant Sony Group, toymaker Tomy and several Japanese universities jointly developed the robots. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "date": "January 18, 2024 03:50 pm",
        "content": "A senior oncologist of the Teaching Hospital in Karapitiya has been arrested for allegedly assaulting a female junior staff member during a contentious situation that had ensued on Wednesday (Jan.17). According to the police media division, the specialist doctor in question, who was arrested by Galle Police, is now receiving medical care at a private hospital under police custody. The doctor, 61, had assaulted the staff member during a heated argument between him and the other staffers on Wednesday morning after he accused them of disrupting hospital services by going on a token strike the day before. The hospitals authorities had brought the situation under control, however, a female junior staff member got herself admitted to the Karapitiya Teaching Hospital, citing an assault by the senior oncologist. Against this backdrop, the Association of Medical Specialists (AMS) has raised deep concerns about what it called were serious incidents that affect the safety of Dr. S.C.R. Perera and cancer care. In a letter, the Karapitiya branch of AMS urged the hospitals director to conduct an urgent impartial inquiry and also restore normal services of the institution at the earliest possible. The normal practice island-wide has been to sustain and maintain cancer-related clinical work during the trade union actions by all health workers. During TUA on the 16th January 2024, work at the onco surgical unit had been disrupted and compromised during surgical operations. Dr. S.C.R. Perera, Senior Consultant Oncological Surgeon had duly written a complaint and raised his concern regarding disruption of cancer surgery. Thereafter when Dr. S.C.R. Perera proceeded to the Directors office on the following day (17th) there had been life threatening mob attack on him by some categories of employees. We note with regret the continuous harassment of our senior colleague in different forms to impeding his work and provision of cancer care in our institution since then.",

        "date": "January 18, 2024 04:03 pm",
        "content": "A Portuguese dog named Bobi made headlines last year when he was crowned the worlds oldest dog ever by Guinness World Records (GWR) - beating a previous record that stood for nearly a century. Bobi died in October at the official age of 31 years and 165 days. But now his title has been thrown into doubt, after some veterinarians questioned evidence of Bobis age. GWR have now suspended the title and launched an investigation. Bobi was a purebred Rafeiro do Alentejo - a breed that has an average life expectancy of 12 to 14 years. His grand old age was validated by the Portuguese governments pet database, which is managed by the National Union of Veterinarians, GWR said last year. But as news of his crowning rapidly spread - so too did suspicion. An investigation by Wired magazine found that Bobi had been registered on Portugals pet database as having been born in 1992, but it had no registration or data that can confirm or deny this statement. There were also questions over old photos of the pet that showed different markings on his fur, with some suggesting it was a different dog altogether. Among experts, there has been growing scepticism. Danny Chambers, a member of the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons, told The Guardian: Not a single one of my veterinary colleagues believe Bobi was actually 31 years old. Now, Guinness World Records have launched a formal investigation. While our review is ongoing, we have decided to temporarily pause applications on both the record titles for oldest dog living and (oldest dog) ever until all of our findings are in place and have been communicated, a spokesperson told the AFP news agency. Bobi lived his whole life with the Costa family in the village of Conqueiros, near Portugals west coast. His owner, Leonel Costa, said in a statement that an elite within the veterinary world... tried to give people the idea that Bobis life story was not true. Mr Costa believes the backlash came because he attributed Bobis longevity to eating a diet similar to that of humans, rather than pet food. He says this goes against the recommendations of many veterinarians. Everything would be different if we had said he ate pet food for three decades, Mr Costa said, adding that everything GWR had requested to validate Bobis age had been met. Until Bobis death, the previous oldest dog ever was Australias Bluey, who died in 1939 at the age of 29. Source: BBC -Agencies",

        "date": "January 18, 2024 04:20 pm",
        "content": "Minister of Foreign Affairs Ali Sabry has highlighted that a humanitarian ceasefire is the only solution to halt the mounting civilian death toll in the ongoing conflict between Israel and Palestine. Reassuring Sri Lankas commitment to support a just and comprehensive negotiated political settlement to the Palestine issue in line with the relevant UN resolutions, leading to two States living side by side based on the 1967 borders, Minister Sabry called for the unhindered facilitation of humanitarian aid entry into Gaza at the scale that is required to prevent the risk of famine, disease and malnutrition. The Minister made these remarks while addressing the NAM Ministerial Committee on Palestine, at the invitation of the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Uganda, and expressed Sri Lankas deep concern on the tragedy that is continuing to unfold, causing an unprecedented level of civilian casualties in Gaza. The meeting was held on the sidelines of the Meeting of the Foreign Ministers of the NAM on Wednesday (17 Jan.) in Kampala, Uganda. The Ministerial Committee on Palestine, comprising 12 members, is a working group of the NAM, that was formed to strengthen the NAMs support for the independence of Palestine. Addressing the Committee, Minister Sabry reiterated Sri Lankas long held principled position on Palestine that recognizes the legitimate and inalienable right to Statehood of the People of Palestine. He further commended the dedication and courage of the healthcare and humanitarian aid workers in Gaza including the significant work carried out by the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA). Minister Sabry welcomed the high priority accorded to the humanitarian crisis in Gaza and the Palestine issue at the 19th Summit of the NAM. Meanwhile, referring to the double standards in the response to the crisis in Gaza, he called upon the international community to form a united front and a collective voice towards alleviating the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. Sri Lanka chairs the UN Special Committee to Investigate Israeli Practices Affecting the Human Rights of the Palestinian People and Other Arabs of the Occupied Territories since 1968. Sri Lanka has thus been a significant voice in the UN consistently, on the violation of human rights in the occupied territories. The NAM Ministerial Committee on Palestine adopted a Declaration, emphasizing NAMs support to the Palestine cause. Foreign Secretary Aruni Wijewardane and Senior Officials of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs participated at the Meeting.",

        "content": "The former chief operating officer of Meta, Sheryl Sandberg, is leaving the companys board of directors. Ms Sandberg, one of the most high-profile women in the tech industry, said that this feels like the right time to step away as Meta is well-positioned for the future. She will serve as an informal advisor to the company going forward. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg thanked her for the extraordinary contributions to the company. Ms Sandberg, 54, joined the firm when it was a small start-up named Facebook. A veteran of Google, she helped turn its advertising business into a profit powerhouse, as the company grew to include Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger. Her books, including Lean In: Women, Work, and the Will to Lead - which she described as a sort of feminist manifesto - made her a global celebrity. The company also faced massive criticism under her watch, including misinformation during the 2016 election, the Cambridge Analytica privacy scandal in 2018, and the Capitol riot in 2021. She posted about her departure in a Facebook post on Wednesday, saying she has a heart filled with gratitude and a mind filled with memories. She said that serving as Facebook and Metas COO for over 14 years and a board member for 12 years was the opportunity of a lifetime. Shortly after Ms Sandbergs announcement, Mr Zuckerberg responded with a short reply. Thank you Sheryl for the extraordinary contributions you have made to our company and community over the years, he commented on her post. Your dedication and guidance have been instrumental in driving our success and I am grateful for your unwavering commitment to me and Meta over the years. Meta is facing new challenges as countries tighten social media regulations and iPhone maker Apple changes its privacy rules, hitting the social media firms targeted ad business.

        "title": "Sugar scam: COPF slams Finance Ministry, IRDs failure to collect foregone taxes from companies involved",
        "date": "January 18, 2024 04:53 pm",
        "content": "The Committee on Public Finance (COPF) has expressed its deep dissatisfaction with the Finance Ministry and the Inland Revenue Department (IRD) over the failure to collect foregone taxes from major corporations implicated in the Sugar scam, as outlined in the forensic report compiled by the Auditor General. A meeting of COPF was convened under the chairmanship of Dr. Harsha de Silva, during which the committee members underscored its disappointment with the lack of action taken by the authorities despite a 99.5 reduction in the Special Commodity Levy on sugar imports, as stipulated on Extraordinary Gazette dated October 13, 2020. The COPF emphasized that no accountability measures have been implemented, allowing certain large corporations to unfairly benefit from the reduced tax rate at the expense of consumers. Specifically, the COPF inquired about the extent of tax collection from the implicated companies and directed the Inland Revenue Department to submit a comprehensive report within one week. The COPF members said they aim to gain clarity on the current status of tax collection related to the Sugar scam. Further addressing the issue, the committee highlighted its concerns over the proposed reversal of the tax policy, which aims to increase the Special Commodity Levy on sugar from Rs. 0.25 per kilogram back to Rs. 50 per kilogram. The Finance Ministrys intention to collect Rs. 30 billion from the average Sri Lankan while allowing implicated corporations to evade responsibility was strongly criticized. The committee emphasized the need to hold wrongdoers accountable before imposing additional financial burdens on the general public. Additionally, the committee engaged with officials from the Consumer Affairs Authority (CAA) to address concerns about the maximum retail price (MRP) not being adhered to by distributors. The CAA officials revealed that despite conducting 342 raids and imposing fines on micro, small, and medium businesses exceeding the MRP, challenges persist in penalizing wholesale distributors due to the absence of a maximum wholesale price in the gazette. The committee directed the CAA to conduct a comprehensive study on the imposition of MRP, considering factors such as the Special Commodity Levy and importer prices. Furthermore, the COPF requested the CAA to propose a mechanism to address the ongoing issue of wholesale distributors selling above the MRP and engaging in fraudulent activities. Additionally, the Committee delved into the implications of the Order under Section 22 of the Foreign Exchange Act No. 12 of 2017. This order outlines provisions designed to regulate the movement of funds and foreign exchange transactions for individuals and companies in Sri Lanka, with the overarching objective of sustaining economic stability and effectively managing foreign exchange reserves. The migration allowance, as stipulated in the order, remains at USD 50,000 with a reduced allowance of USD 20,000 for temporary visa holders. Officials from the Central Bank apprised the Committee of amendments to the previous gazette, including provisions allowing Sri Lankan individuals to purchase share options in their own overseas companies. Additionally, individuals are now permitted to withdraw USD 200,000 for investment in listed companies and USD 100,000 for unlisted companies. While acknowledging these changes, the COPF chairman raised concerns about the feasibility of maintaining such a low migration allowance. He questioned the officials on the prevalence of individuals resorting to unofficial channels, such as Hawala and cryptocurrencies, due to these restrictions. Furthermore, the COPF chairman inquired whether the officials were aware of instances where Sri Lankans were converting their rupees to USDT (cryptocurrency) through various platforms such as Binance, and subsequently transferring funds abroad or investing in cryptocurrencies. Notably, cryptocurrencies were recently recognized as an asset class by the US Securities and Exchange Commission, with the approval of Exchange-traded funds just last week. In response to the chairmans queries, officials present were unaware of such occurrences and committed to conducting a thorough study into the matter. They emphasized that exchanging rupees into dollars outside formal channels is not permitted, and they will investigate the potential misuse of unofficial avenues for currency exchange and investment.",

        "title": "Indian Navy rescues crew after Houthis hit ship off Yemen",
        "date": "January 18, 2024 10:19 pm",
        "content": "The Indian Navy said on Thursday it had rescued the crew of a U.S.-owned vessel in the Gulf of Aden after an attack by Yemens Houthi movement as tensions in the regions sea lanes disrupted global trade. Following the attack on the U.S. Genco Picardy late on Wednesday, the U.S. military said its forces had conducted strikes on 14 Houthi missiles that presented an imminent threat to merchant vessels and U.S. Navy ships in the region. Attacks by the Iran-allied Houthi militia on ships in and around the Red Sea since November have slowed trade between Asia and Europe and alarmed major powers in an escalation of the war between Israel and Palestinian Hamas militants in Gaza. The Houthis say they are acting in solidarity with Palestinians and have threatened to target U.S. ships in response to American and British strikes on the groups positions. The strategy pursued by U.S. President Joe Biden - a blend of limited military strikes and sanctions - appears aimed at preventing a wider Middle East conflict even as Washington seeks to punish the Houthis, security and military experts say. But it is unclear whether it will accomplish Bidens main goal: halting attacks by militants that are causing supply bottlenecks and raising fears that inflation could reignite. After the latest attack, India diverted a warship deployed in the region to rescue the 22 crew on board the Genco Picardy, including nine Indians. The crew were all safe and a fire on board the vessel had been extinguished. The Houthi movement said its missiles had made a direct hit on the bulk carrier. Shipping operator Genco confirmed the attack, and said its vessel was hit by a projectile while it was passing through the Gulf of Aden with a cargo of phosphate rock. SUEZ CANAL SUFFERS The attacks target a route that accounts for about 15 of the worlds shipping traffic and acts as a vital conduit between Europe and Asia. The alternative shipping route around South Africas Cape of Good Hope can add 10-14 days to a journey compared to passage via the Red Sea and the Suez Canal. A sharp downturn in revenue from the Suez Canal has struck a painful new blow to Egypts already deteriorating economy. The chairman of the Suez Canal Authority said last week that revenue had fallen by 40 in the first 11 days of January. Wheat shipments via the Suez Canal tumbled almost 40 in the first half of January to 0.5 million metric tons, the World Trade Organization said on Thursday. The Red Sea crisis was rippling through the business world and reviving concerns about stretched supply chains that emerged when activity picked up after the COVID-19 pandemic. The re-routing of a growing number of vessels is altering re-fuelling patterns and boosting demand for bunker fuel used by ships at far-flung ports, from Mauritius to South Africa to the Canary Islands. Denmarks Maersk (MAERSKb.CO), opens new tab and other large shipping lines have instructed hundreds of commercial vessels to stay clear of the Red Sea. The attacks, as well as weather-related closures and stoppages in Europe, risked causing congestion at several container terminals, Maersk told its customers on Thursday. Officials at Rotterdam Port, Europes largest, expect traffic to become busier from the end of January as delayed ships start to arrive but they do not expect any serious logistical issues. Ports in Italy and France are worried about being bypassed as ships steer away from the main Mediterranean route. We are not observing a significant impact as of today but its a concern, Christophe Castaner, chairman of Marseille port, told a press conference on Thursday. If the crisis persists, one scenario could be that vessels travelling around Africa call in at Morocco and transfer goods to other ships to serve the Mediterranean, he added.

        "title": "Red Sea shipping attacks pressure Chinas exporters as delays, costs mount",
        "date": "January 19, 2024 11:07 am",
        "content": "For Chinese businessman Han Changming, disruptions to Red Sea freight are threatening the survival of his trading company in the eastern province of Fujian. Han, who exports Chinese-made cars to Africa and imports off-road vehicles from Europe, told Reuters the cost of shipping a container to Europe had surged to roughly 7,000 from 3,000 in December, when Yemens Iran-aligned Houthi movement escalated attacks on shipping. The disruptions have wiped out our already thin profits, said Han, adding that higher shipping-insurance premiums are also taking a toll on Fuzhou Han Changming International Trade Co Ltd, the company he founded in 2016. The rupture of one of the worlds busiest shipping routes has exposed the vulnerability of Chinas export-reliant economy to supply snarls and external demand shocks. In a speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos on Tuesday, Premier Li Qiang emphasised the need to keep global supply chains stable and smooth, without referring specifically to the Red Sea. Some companies, such as U.S.-based BDI Furniture, have said they are relying more on factories in places such as Turkey and Vietnam to mitigate the impact of the disruptions, adding to recent moves by Western countries to reduce dependence on China amid geopolitical tensions. At stake for China now is the danger that other firms will follow suit and reassess their de-risking strategy, opting potentially to shift production closer to home, an approach known as near-shoring. If its permanent, and it could be permanent, then the whole mechanism will be readjusted, said Marco Castelli, founder of IC Trade, which exports Chinese-made mechanical components to Europe. Some (companies) may also consider moving more production to India, which is one week closer to Europe. Companies need to reevaluate everything. Further Red Sea disruptions would pile pressure on a struggling Chinese economy already contending with a property crisis, weak consumer demand, a shrinking population and sluggish global growth. With Europe and Africa trade accounting for 40 of Hans overall business, he said he had been pleading with suppliers and customers to shoulder some of the additional costs to keep his company afloat. Shipping times for some orders were delayed by up to several weeks, he said. Compounding the pain for some firms, the disruptions come as many are navigating a logistics challenge ahead of Lunar New Year in February, when some 300 million migrant workers go on leave and almost all factories in China shut, creating a scramble in the preceding weeks to get goods shipped. Mike Sagan, the Shenzhen-based vice president for supply chains and operations at KidKraft, a maker of outdoor play equipment and wooden toys, said many European customers are slamming on the brakes, saying: Dont ship anything, hold it. A lot of suppliers, theyre screaming about money today, said Sagan, whose company supplies retailers including Walmart and Target. A worry for larger manufacturers, he said, is the snowball effect on smaller suppliers with tight margins, as they would be among the last to receive payments but are critical to the supply chain. Rerouting vessels from the Red Sea - the shortest route from Asia to Europe via the Suez Canal - around the Cape of Good Hope can add two weeks to shipping schedules, reducing global container capacity and cleaving supply chains as it takes longer for vessels to return to ports to reload. That probably means delays for goods scheduled to arrive on Western shelves in April or May. Some logistics companies are already reporting a container shortage at Ningbo-Zhoushan port in China, one of the worlds busiest by cargo tonnage, according to BMI, an industry research firm. The Suez Canal is a primary route for Chinas westward shipments of goods, including around 60 of its exports to Europe, according to the Middle East Institute, a Washington-based think tank. HUGE IMPACT Yang Bingben, whose company makes industrial-use valves in eastern Chinas manufacturing hub of Wenzhou, said a client in Shanghai this week slashed an order for 75 valves - intended for assembly into large machinery for shipment overseas - to 15 amid soaring freight costs. The impact is huge, said Yang, adding that he had prepared raw materials that could not be returned because they had been processed. Its like I received an order that makes me lose money. Yang is now rethinking his staffing needs for this year, saying he cant guarantee salaries as his workers are paid based on the amount of work they do. If I dont have enough work to give them, Im afraid they wont be able to make a living. In southern China, Wei Qiongfang, a freight forwarder based in Guangzhou, said some suppliers were delaying shipments of lower-value goods, pressuring manufacturers stockpiles. As once-predictable trade conditions become increasingly uncertain, the impact is especially acute for companies that rely on just-in-time deliveries or that need to change their stock regularly. Another issue, said Castelli, is that factories do not get paid until goods arrive at their destination. So if their payment is delayed, they cant pay their suppliers, they cant pay their workers, he said. China is so successful in the global market because they work with tiny margins: when you have volume, the money rolls in; when the money stops coming, you have a big problem. In the Pearl River Delta city of Dongguan, Gerhard Flatz, managing director of premium sportswear manufacturer KTC, is concerned that some companies grappling with shrinking margins will go under. So, they are struggling, and now there is another logistics crisis. You know, at some point many will have to shut down, said Flatz. Source: Reuters -Agencies",

Jaishankar to strongly take up the matter with the Sri Lankan Government for the immediate release of all the Indian fishermen and their fishing boat apprehended in two back-to-back incidents during the Pongal season. With a sense of deep anguish, I would like to draw your attention to the repeated apprehensions of fishermen and their fishing boats by the Sri Lankan Navy, Stalin said in his letter to Jaishankar on Wednesday. Ten fishermen who ventured into the sea on January 13 from Nagapattinam Fishing Harbour were apprehended on January 15 along with their mechanized fishing boat bearing Registration No.IND-TN-06-MM-870 and 18 fishermen from Pamban, Ramanathapuram, along with their two mechanized boats bearing Registration Numbers IND-TN-10-MM-2673 and IND-TN-10-MM-2677 were apprehended on January 16, he said. These apprehensions have created an insecure atmosphere among the fishing community who are solely dependent on fishing for their livelihoods. As there appears to be no respite in the arrests it is important to impress upon Sri Lanka to refrain from these arbitrary arrests and detentions of boats and to set a clear timeline to release all the boats under their custody, Stalin said.

        "title": "First US spacecraft to attempt moon landing in decades burns up after failed mission",
        "date": "January 19, 2024 12:11 pm",
        "content": "After soaring hundreds of thousands of miles through space and battling a propellant issue that dashed its plans, the Peregrine lunar lander has likely met its fiery end. The spacecraft was expected to conclude its truncated, 10-day journey around 4 p.m. ET Thursday as it smashed into the Earths thick atmosphere over a remote area of the South Pacific Ocean, due east of Australia. Astrobotic Technology, the Pittsburgh-based company that developed the Peregrine lander under a contract with NASA, confirmed the spacecrafts demise, saying it lost contact with the vehicle moments before the planned reentry time, which indicates the vehicle completed its controlled re-entry over open water in the South Pacific. However, the company added in a social media post, we await independent confirmation from government entities. Officials from NASA and Astrobotic are expected to speak publicly on the mission during a news briefing at 1 p.m. ET Friday. The failed mission is a setback for Astrobotic and NASA, whose overall goal is to create a stable of commercially developed, relatively cheap lunar landers capable of completing robotic missions to the moon as the space agency works toward a crewed lunar landing later this decade. Critical setbacks after launch The Peregrine lander launched January 8 atop a Vulcan Centaur rocket, a new vehicle developed by United Launch Alliance, a joint venture between Lockheed Martin and Boeing. The launch went off without a hitch, safely delivering the Peregrine lander into Earths orbit on a path toward the moon. If the spacecraft had been successful in reaching the lunar surface, it would have been the first US mission to soft-land on the moon since the Apollo 17 mission in 1972. But hours into its solo flight, the Peregrine lander encountered critical setbacks. Astrobotic confirmed the spacecraft suffered a severe issue with its onboard propulsion systems and was leaking fuel, leaving the lander without enough gas to make a soft touchdown on the moon. Astrobotic then shifted course. The company directed the spacecraft to operate more like a satellite, testing its onboard scientific instruments and other systems as it flew thousands of miles through the void. Ultimately, Astrobotic determined that it would dispose of the vehicle by crashing it into Earths atmosphere at high speeds. What Peregrines failure means The loss of the Peregrine lander is a blow to Astrobotic and NASA. A deal inked between the two organizations made this mission possible, with NASA handing over 108 million to aid Astrobotic with its development effort and fly five payloads. That price tag is a roughly 36 increase over the original contract value, with the deal being renegotiated amid pandemic-related supply chain issues, according to Joel Kearns, deputy associate administrator for exploration in NASAs science mission directorate. The US space agency does not consider the Peregrine spacecraft its only option for conducting robotic research on the moon. NASA also has partnerships with three other companies developing robotic lunar landers  including Houston-based Intuitive Machines, which could launch its first mission in mid-February. Through the Commercial Lunar Payload Services program, NASA designed those lunar lander contracts as fixed price agreements, meaning the space agency hands over one lump sum of money rather than continuing to pay a company throughout the development process as hiccups arise. This is one of many relatively cheap missions that are going to be sent to the surface of the moon to try to break the paradigm to try to get to a new price point, Thornton told CNN earlier this month. The deal is also structured so that the companies maintain complete ownership over their own vehicles, and NASA becomes just one of many customers flying cargo on the landers. A proving ground for commercial lunar landers A private lunar lander has never safely reached the moons surface  though other companies have tried. In 2019, a spacecraft built by Israel-based company SpaceIL smashed into the moon during a landing attempt. And again in 2023, Japan-based company Ispace lost control of its lander as it careened toward the moons surface. SpaceIL, Ispace and Astrobotic all have roots in the same competition: the Google Lunar X Prize, which ran from 2007 to 2018 and offered a company that could reach the moon a 20 million grand prize. But X Prize concluded with no winner since none of the teams had launched by the final deadline. Whether a commercially developed lunar lander can reach the moons surface remains to be seen  and perhaps an even more intriguing question is whether moon missions offer a financially sustainable business model for these companies. Apart from money from NASA and other government space agencies, Astrobotics revenue for the Peregrine mission was generated by partnerships that included space burial companies that send human remains to the moon as well as packaged trinkets, plaques, a bitcoin, and other commemorative objects for customers. Astrobotics Thornton admitted to reporters that the Peregrine mission cost his company more money than it made. However, a failure would not mean the end for Astrobotic, he said in remarks to CNN. Its certainly going to have some impact on our relationships and our ability to secure additional missions in the future, Thornton said on January 2. It certainly wouldnt be the end of the business, but it would certainly be challenging. Were in a high-risk space venture, and this is just the nature of space businesses. Astrobotic already has a contract to fly another robotic lunar lander mission for NASA later this year. Called Griffin, that lander  a larger model than Peregrine  will aim to put a rover near the moons south pole. Source: CNN --Agencies",

A group of officials from the IMF arrived in Sri Lanka on 11 January to engage in discussions for a period of one week, while studying the process of economic reforms carried out within the country, following the IMFs approval of the first review under the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) arrangement for Sri Lanka. During a discussion with President Ranil Wickremesinghe, the IMF delegation congratulated the country on completing the first review under its program and highlighted the positive outset of the program, recognizing the challenging reforms undertaken by Sri Lanka and their significant impact on the domestic population.",

        "content": "An appeal filed challenging the decision of the Court of Appeal to dismiss the petition, filed seeking the disqualification of State Minister Diana Gamages parliamentary seat, has been allowed to be taken up for hearing. The relevant order was issued by the Supreme Court when the appeal was called before a three-member judge bench led by Justice Preethi Padman Surasena today (19). Social activist Oshala Herath had filed the relevant appeal two weeks after the petition he had filed over Diana Gamages parliamentary seat and citizenship was dismissed by the Appeals Court. Naming State Minister Gamage and several others as the respondent of his appeal, Herath said he had previously filed a petition alleging that the lawmaker is unqualified to hold the position of a member of parliament in Sri Lanka, as she also holds dual citizenship. However, a three-member judge bench of the Appeals Court delivered a split decision on October 31, 2023 and dismissed the petition, subject to a fee. Accordingly, Herath has sought a Supreme Court order determining that the Appeals Court ruling is unlawful and that State Minister Gamage is not qualified to hold parliamentary seat.",

        "title": "Swift completion of final agreements with official creditors critical for Sri Lanka  IMF",
        "date": "January 19, 2024 03:35 pm",
        "content": "The International Monetary Fund (IMF) says it is critical for Sri Lanka to swiftly complete the final agreements with the official creditors and reach a resolution with the external private creditors. IMF mission team, led by Senior Mission Chief Peter Breuer, was in Sri Lanka from January 11-19 to discuss recent macroeconomic developments and progress in implementing economic and financial policies under the EFF arrangement. Issuing a statement to convey its preliminary findings observed during the visit, the delegation says the economic reform program implemented by the Sri Lankan authorities is now yielding the first signs of recovery with positive real GDP growth in the third quarter of 2023, low inflation, increased revenue collection, and a build-up of external reserves. Commending the commendable progress made by putting debt on a path towards sustainability, the IMF mission team highlighted that execution of the domestic debt restructuring was an important milestone. However, swift completion of final agreements with official creditors and reaching a resolution with external private creditors remain critical, the statement underscored. According to the delegation, progress in meeting key commitments under the IMF-supported program is set to be formally assessed in the context of the second review of the EFF arrangement alongside the forthcoming 2024 Article IV consultation assessing Sri Lankas economic health. Attached below is the full statement issued by the IMF mission team: The economic reform program implemented by the Sri Lankan authorities is yielding the first signs of recovery. Real GDP recorded positive growth of 1.6 percent year-on-year in the third quarter of 2023, the first expansion in six consecutive quarters. Shortages of essentials have eased, and inflation remains contained. Gross international reserves increased by USD 2.5 billion during 2023, and preliminary data point to improved fiscal revenue collections during the fourth quarter of 2023. However, challenges remain as these improvements need to translate into improved living conditions for Sri Lankas people. In this context, sustaining the reform momentum and ensuring timely implementation of all program commitments are critical to rebuilding confidence and putting the recovery on a firm footing that will benefit all people. Swift progress towards the introduction of a progressive property tax is key to ensuring fair burden sharing while sustaining the revenue-based consolidation. Tax policy measures need to be accompanied by strengthening tax administration, removing tax exemptions, and actively eliminating tax evasion to make the reforms more sustainable and to further build confidence among creditors to support Sri Lankas efforts to regain debt sustainability. Building on the Central Bank of Sri Lankas success in taming inflation, future monetary policy decisions should remain prudent with a focus on keeping inflation expectations well anchored. Against continued uncertainty, it remains important to continue rebuilding external buffers through strong reserve accumulation. Protecting the poor and the vulnerable through improved targeting and better coverage of cash transfers remains critical. To safeguard the stability of the financial sector and bolster its capacity to support economic growth, the authorities need to urgently finalize amendments to the Banking Act in line with their commitment under the IMF-supported program, implement the bank recapitalization plan and strengthen the financial supervision and crisis management framework. Following the publication of the IMF Governance Diagnostic report, it is now imperative for the authorities to adopt their own action plan for implementing the recommendations in the report beyond the priority commitments under the EFF arrangement. At the same time, ensuring an enabling environment for governance and transparency reforms to take place is key to bolstering public confidence and facilitating implementation of these important efforts. The authorities have made commendable progress with putting debt on a path towards sustainability. The execution of the domestic debt restructuring was an important milestone. A swift completion of final agreements with official creditors and reaching a resolution with external private creditors remain critical. Progress in meeting key commitments under the IMF-supported program will be formally assessed in the context of the second review of the EFF arrangement alongside the forthcoming 2024 Article IV consultation assessing Sri Lankas economic health. The IMF team held meetings with President and Finance Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) Governor Dr. P. Nandalal Weerasinghe, Speaker Mr. Mahinda Yapa Abeywardana, Minister Mr. Kanchana Wijesekera, Minister Mr. Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe,State Minister Mr. Shehan Semasinghe, Secretary to the Treasury Mr. K M Mahinda Siriwardana, Governor of Northern Province Mrs. P.S.M.Charles, Governor of Eastern Province Senthil Thondaman, and other senior government and CBSL officials. The IMF team also met with Parliamentarians, representatives from the private sector, civil society organizations, and development partners. We would like to thank the authorities for the excellent collaboration during the mission, including during the missions visit to the Northern and Eastern provinces. This visit enriched the mission teams understanding of the challenges as well as the potential of Sri Lanka. We reaffirm our commitment to support Sri Lanka for a full economic recovery from the crisis.",

        "date": "January 19, 2024 05:29 pm",
        "content": "President Ranil Wickremesinghe on Friday (Jan.19) commended President Yoweri Museveni for assuming leadership at the 19th Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) Summit in Kampala, Uganda. He highlighted the current global challenges, including the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, the shift in the post-Cold War order, and emerging multipolar dynamics. President Wickremesinghe emphasized the need for NAM to reinvent itself, transforming into the largest bloc representing the Global South. Proposing the recognition of Palestine and addressing various geopolitical, economic, and technological issues, he called for a united NAM with updated objectives to build a multipolar world. The President urged for a dynamic bloc capable of shaping the new global order, emphasizing that the future lies in their hands. He also expressed gratitude to President Museveni and Uganda for hosting the summit. Minister of Foreign Affairs Ali Sabry, State Minister Chamara Sampath Dasanayake, and MPs Kings Nelson, Nimal Piyatissa, Kumarasiri Ratnayake and Udayakantha Gunathilake, Presidents Secretary Saman Ekanayake, Presidents Senior Adviser on Climate Change Ruwan Wijewardene were also present on this occasion. Following is the full speech delivered by President Ranil Wickremesinghe; Let me begin by congratulating you President Yoweri Museveni of Uganda for taking over the helm of the Non-Aligned Movement at this 19th Summit. Your leadership is even more timely as Uganda assumes this role at a critical moment of collective awareness among countries of the global South. This is the first NAM Summit following the onset of the pandemic, the debt crisis, climate catastrophe, new global competition, and the ensuing multiple implications for the world, in particular, for the Global South. As we meet today, a humanitarian crisis is unfolding in the Gaza Strip and beyond. For over 3 months immense suffering and losses have been endured by the Palestinian civilian population, endangering regional security and stability. Until now, the NAM was largely silent. How can we remain silent when Gaza is destroyed? People are denied humanitarian aid and a vast majority of the dead are innocent civilians. Silence implies consent. It is encouraging that this 19th Summit has given the highest priority to this crisis in Gaza and the inalienable rights of the people of Palestine to self-determination and the realisation of an independent and sovereign state of Palestine. We must congratulate South Africa for the bold stand it has taken in regard to Gaza. The international community has already called for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire and the release of hostages. There cannot be a two-state solution based on one state  Israel. No resolution is possible without a state of Palestine. Therefore, in line with multiple UN Resolutions, and the Declaration of this Summit, the international community must recognise the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem as territories coming within the State of Palestine and in addition, there should be no change in the ethnic composition of Gaza. Sri Lanka also proposes that the State of Palestine be established within 5 years and no more. We are now witnessing the end of the post-Cold War order and the coming into being of the evolving multipolar world. On the geopolitical front, we are witnessing a resurgence of latent and open conflicts involving former and aspiring major powers. In Europe the transatlantic military alliance has been strengthened, past arms control agreements have collapsed, military expenditure has reached historically unprecedented levels and nuclear weapons are once again the subject of apparently serious policy discussion. Outer space and the oceans have become potential theatres of conflict and geo-strategic competition including in our vicinity in the Indian and Pacific Oceans. Free trade and economic integration is being reversed by policy-driven rise of trade protectionism due to strategic competition among major powers. Furthermore, this being extended further with the concepts of de-coupling and de-risking. A unilateral declaration of a new trade order and the setting aside of multilateralism by the West of the WTO. The weaponising of the Dollar. New challenges of economic and the debt crisis, climate justice, food and energy security. Digital and technological divides and advanced WMD arsenals have aggravated existing inequalities between the developing states of the NAM and the developed world. The theme of this Summit Deepening Cooperation for Shared Global Affluence reflects the need to address the inequities between our two worlds. Furthermore, experience shows us that, to succeed we need a strong and united NAM that contributes to a better world for all. To do so, we have to reinvent ourselves. Our membership today is no longer a grouping of weak states. We must recognise that as a result of the rapid progress and economic advancement of some of Asian, African and Latin American states. A majority of the 10 leading economies of 2050 will belong to this movement. We see, among us, rising aspirants for leadership status in global affairs. They must be prepared to give leadership. Furthermore, there is a vital role we must play as geostrategic rivalries in political, economic, technological and military terms become more pronounced among former and new contenders for Major Power status. Therefore, the NAM must reinvent itself under your Chairmanship. Assume a new role in a multipolar world  to transform itself as the largest bloc representing the Global South. We must also recast our objectives. While upholding the Bandung Principles in the evolving multipolar world we need to, oppose the spread of big power rivalry including the coercion of uncommitted states, build a multipolar world which incorporates the political, economic, social and climate change mitigation aspirations of the Global South. Let us transform ourselves from this loose movement to become a dynamic bloc of the Global South and its friends. Let us establish an effective permanent operational structure which is equipped to address the contemporary challenges facing the Global South. An organisation which is capable of shaping the new order. Our future lies in our hands. We can make it or break it. Let us make it work. Let me conclude by thanking you Mr President and the Government of Uganda for the excellent arrangements for hosting this important 19th Summit of the Non-Aligned Movement. --PMD",
