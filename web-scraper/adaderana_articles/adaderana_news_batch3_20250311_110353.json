        "date": "November 15, 2024 10:48 am",
        "content": "The National Peoples Power (NPP) has already secured a two-thirds majority in Parliament after winning a total of 123 seats in the House in the 2024 General Election. NPP had confirmed its majority power in parliament, which it sought during the election campaigning, after winning a whopping 16 out of the 19 available seats in the Gampaha District. NPP polled a total of 898,759 votes (72) to win the district while the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) placed second with 150,445 votes (12.18). The NPP has thereby secured 16 seats in the district while the SJB has won the 3 remaining seats. This brings the partys tally of seats secured thus far to 123. It needed 113 seats in the 225-member house to secure a majority. NPP has so far polled a total of 6,842,223, which is 61.73 of the votes counted thus far. NPP leader and President Anura Kumara Dissanayake, who had called for snap parliamentary elections after winning the presidential poll, needs a clear majority to deliver his promise to combat corruption and restore stability after the countrys worst-ever economic crisis. He had urged the public to provide the NPP government with the two-thirds majority it wants to be able to pass its ambitious reforms. In the previous parliament, which was dissolved by Dissanayake, the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) which now leads the NPP, had just three seats.",

The High Commission of India in Colombo congratulated President and NPP leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake on the partys win, reaffirming Indias commitment to strengthening bilateral ties between the two nations. Sharing a post on X, the High Commission of India in Colombo wrote, HC Santosh Jha called on the President  Leader of NPP Anura Kumara Dissanayake to congratulate on NPPs victory in Sri Lanka ParliamentaryElections2024. As a fellow democracy, India welcomes the mandate  remains committed to further strengthening bilateral ties for the benefit of our people, the post added. Sri Lankan President Dissanayakes leftist coalition registered a landslide victory in Sri Lankas snap parliamentary elections, according to official results announced by the countrys election commission. The Left-leaning coalition won 159 seats in the 225-member parliament, according to the Sri Lanka Election Commission website as per the final results of the polls that were held on November 14. Dissanayake, needed a clear majority to fulfil his promises and his NPP coalition secured a two-thirds majority in the 225-member parliament, winning 159 seats, whereas, opposition leader Premadasas party won 35 seats. Opposition leader Sajith Premadasas (the son of former President Ranasinghe Premadasa) party the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) party won 40 seats and the New Democratic Front (NDF), backed by previous President Ranil Wickremesinghe, won just five seats. The SLPP won 3 seats, while the ITAK was victorious in 8 seats, and the SB registered a win in only one seat. The SLMC won three seats while the UNP and the DTNA won one seat each. According to a report by Al Jazeera, Dissanayake has pledged to abolish the countrys executive presidency, a system under which power is largely centralised under the president. Dissanayake won the presidential elections held in September this year. With his coalition holding just three seats in the outgoing parliament, the 55-year-old leader of Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) called snap legislative elections in search of a new mandate. The parliamentary poll mandate enables Dissnayake to ease punishing austerity measures in crisis-stricken Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka has been struggling to recover from its worst economic crisis since independence in 1948 following economic mismanagement by successive governments, the COVID-19 pandemic and 2019 Easter bombings. In 2022, then-President Gotabaya Rajapaksa was forced to resign after tens of thousands of Sri Lankans took to the streets to protest sky-high inflation and fuel and food shortages. Rajapaksas replacement Wickremesinghe, who finished third in Septembers presidential election, oversaw a stabilising of the economy, but his governments efforts to raise revenue, including by raising electricity bills and income taxes, proved unpopular with the public, Al Jazeera noted. In the Sri Lankan unicameral parliament, all members are elected for a five-year term. But 29 out of 225 seats are decided indirectly through a national list. Source: ANI --Agencies",

        "content": "A Pakistani province declared a health emergency Friday due to smog and imposed a shutdown in two major cities. Smog has choked Punjab for weeks, sickening nearly 2 million people and shrouding vast swathes of the province in a toxic haze. A senior provincial minister, Marriyum Aurangzeb, declared the health emergency at a press conference and announced measures to combat the growing crisis. Time off for medical staff is cancelled, all education institutions are shut until further notice, restaurants are closing at 4 p.n. while takeaway is available up until 8 p.m. Authorities are imposing a lockdown in the cities of Multan and Lahore and halting construction work in those two places. Smog is currently a national disaster, Aurangzeb said. It will not all be over in a month or a year. We will evaluate the situation after three days and then announce a further strategy. Average air quality index readings in parts of Lahore, a city of 11 million, exceeded 600 on Friday. Anything over 300 is considered hazardous to health. The dangerous smog is a byproduct of large numbers of vehicles, construction and industrial work as well as burning crops at the start of the winter wheat-planting season, experts say. Pakistans national weather center said rain and wind were forecast for the coming days, helping smoggy conditions to subside and air quality to improve in parts of Punjab. Dr. Muhammad Ashraf, a professor at Jinnah Hospital Lahore and Allama Iqbal Medical College, said the government must take preventative measures well before smog becomes prevalent. It is more of an emergency than COVID-19 because every patient is suffering from respiratory tract infections and disease is prevailing at a mass level, he told The Associated Press earlier this week.

Reflecting on his extensive political journey, Aluthgamage highlighted that his family had been politically active in the Nawalapitiya constituency for seven decades, with his own involvement spanning over 30 years. However, he stated that the outcome of the recent General Election indicated that the people of the Kandy District no longer required his services, leading to his decision to step away from politics. In the 2024 General Election held on Thursday (14), Aluthgamage contested from the New Democratic Front (NDF), under the symbol of the gas cylinder, and secured only 20,401 votes in the district. This was a stark contrast to his previous performances, where he garnered nearly 200,000 votes in previous elections. Acknowledging this significant shift in public sentiment, Aluthgamage remarked, The voters have spoken, and it is clear that my politics is no longer needed. I have therefore decided to retire from active politics.",

        "date": "November 16, 2024 02:08 pm",
        "content": "The 2024 General Election marked a resounding victory for the National Peoples Power (NPP) led by President Anura Kumara Dissanayake, setting unprecedented records in Sri Lankas electoral history. The NPP secured 6,863,186 votes, the highest ever obtained by a political party in a general election, surpassing the 6,853,690 votes won by the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) in 2020. This also accounted for a record-breaking 61.56 of the total vote, overtaking the previous high of 60.33 recorded by the United Peoples Freedom Alliance (UPFA) in 2010. Dominance in Districts and Constituencies The NPP won 21 of the 22 electoral districts, losing only Batticaloa, breaking the UPFAs 2010 record of victories in 19 districts. Furthermore, the party claimed 152 constituencies, shattering the UPFAs 2010 record of 136. Parliamentary Seats and National List Representation The NPP claimed 159 seats in total, including 141 district-level seats and 18 National List seats, becoming the first single party under Sri Lankas proportional representation system to secure a two-thirds majority in Parliament. This surpasses the SLPPs 2020 record of 145 total seats and 17 National List seats. Record-Breaking Preferential Votes Vijitha Herath, contesting from Gampaha District, made history by receiving 716,715 preferential votes, the highest ever recorded by a candidate in Sri Lanka. This eclipsed the previous records set by Ranil Wickremesinghe in 2015 (500,566 votes), Mahinda Rajapaksa in 2020 (527,364 votes), and Harini Amarasuriya earlier in this election with 655,289 votes from Colombo District. Increased Female Representation This election also witnessed a milestone in womens representation, with a record 21 female MPs elected, the highest in Sri Lankas parliamentary history. Among them, 19 represent the NPP, including prominent figures such as Dr. Harini Amarasuriya, Kaushalya Ariyaratne, and Samanmali Gunasinghe. Two MPs, Rohini Kumari Wijeratne and Chamindrani Kiriella, were elected from the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB). A Historic Leap from the 3 Mark The NPPs monumental rise from securing just 3 of the vote in the previous general election demonstrates a significant shift in public sentiment. Also, the NPP was able to mark the first time in the history of a country to set such a record rise from the level of 3 in the previous election.",

        "date": "November 16, 2024 04:29 pm",
        "content": "The Philippines evacuated tens of thousands of people from their homes and cancelled dozens of flights on Saturday, as a super typhoon threatened to unleash heavy rains and powerful winds that could trigger floods and storm surges. Packing winds of 185 kph (115 mph), the storm Man-Yi was heading for the eastern part of the main island of Luzon, spurring the weather agency to raise its second-highest alert for the provinces of Catanduanes and Camarines Sur. Pepito is approaching its peak intensity, it added, using the domestic name for the super typhoon, which it said was likely to make landfall near Catanduanes on Saturday night or early Sunday. Close to 180,000 people in the central region of Bicol have been evacuated, data from the disaster agency showed. The sixth tropical cyclone to hit the Philippines in a month, Man-Yi has also forced cancellation of dozens of flights in the eastern Visayas region facing the Pacific Ocean. The weather agency also warned of dangerous storm surges that could exceed 3 m (10 ft) in coastal areas of Luzon. While Man-Yi was expected to weaken as it moved over the island, it added, the storm would probably stay a typhoon until it reached the South China Sea. About 20 tropical storms strike the Philippines each year on average, bringing heavy rain, strong winds and deadly landslides. In October, floods and landslides brought by Tropical Storm Trami and Typhoon Kong-rey killed 162 people with 22 missing, government figures show. Four storms churned in the western Pacific ocean at the same time this month for the first time since records began in 1951, the Japan Meteorological Agency said. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "date": "November 16, 2024 05:28 pm",
        "content": "The Colombo District has seen a profound shift in voter dynamics in the 2024 General Election, with the leader of the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) Sajith Premadasa suffering a significant decline in support. Premadasa, who garnered an impressive 305,744 votes in the 2020 parliamentary election, managed only 145,611 votes this timemarking a loss of 160,133 votes. Meanwhile, the rise of the National Peoples Power (NPP) has made significant inroads into areas traditionally dominated by the United National Party (UNP) and subsequently the SJB as well. Historically, constituencies such as Colombo-North, Central, East, and West have been strongholds for the UNP, boasting a long history of electoral victories. In 2020, Premadasas SJB managed to wrest control of these areas, consolidating its power. However, the tide has turned in this election, with the NPP claiming dominance in these constituencies. This shift signals a major political realignment in the Colombo District, often regarded as the heart of the UNPs support base. For the first time, the sweeping mandate received by the NPP led by President Anura Kumara Dissanayake also included surprise backing from the North and East of the country which is dominated by the Tamil-speakinh community and had often been secured by the UNP, SJB or other Tamil political alliances. However, SJB leader Premadasa was placed second in the Colombo District preference votes list in the 2024 General Election with 145,611 votes while fellow party members Dr. Harsha De Silva, Mujibur Rahman and S.M. Marikkar have also secured seats from the district. Also, the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) became the main opposition party of the tenth Parliament after polling over 1.9 million votes (17.66) and thereby obtaining 40 seats including 5 bonus seats in the House.",

Speaking about her journey into politics, Samuel, the first female Tamil MP to have been elected through a major political party from the plantation community, emphasized that her entry into the political sphere is not just a personal achievement but a stepping stone for others, especially young people from the plantation sector, who she believes have been confined to outdated frameworks. I am the first to enter politics from here, and my brothers and sisters will undoubtedly follow. These are young individuals with immense talent and a genuine desire to serve the country. For too long, they have been trapped within certain limitations, but now that those barriers have been broken, we can expect a new wave of leadership emerging from the hill country and from other districts, she added. Samuel particularly highlighted the role of women, who she believes have long been restricted to traditional roles, particularly in the household. Women were often confined to the kitchen, but many of them are capable of much more. They possess great potential, and their influence, until now, has been limited by societal expectations. With the first step Ive taken in politics, we will undoubtedly see more women rising to leadership positions, both in Parliament and beyond, she added.",

The Thero questioned the prolonged delay in releasing the preferential vote results for the two districts and urged the Elections Commissioner General to clarify the matter to the public. Ven. Seelarathana Thero also criticized the National Peoples Power (NPP) party, accusing them of hypocrisy. He claimed that despite their campaign emphasis on seeking votes for the party rather than individual candidates, internal disputes over preferential votes have surfaced. I neither believe nor accept this preference vote results. Its astonishing how some individuals have seen their preferential votes skyrocket from one lakh to six, seven, or even eight lakhs. Where did such numbers come from?, he questioned. The Janasetha Peramuna, from which Ven. Battaramulle Seelarathana Thero contested the 2024 Parliamentary Election in the Colombo District under the Tractor symbol, managed to obtain only 970 votes in the district. However, its preference vote results were not counted, as the party was disqualified for failing to meet the required 5 of the total votes cast in the district",
