In addition, Pakistan is regularly exporting poultry and poultry products to a number of countries including the United Arab Emirates, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and Hong Kong, the letter noted. The Pakistani High Commission went on to request the Sri Lankan Foreign Affairs Ministry to update the relevant authorities in Sri Lanka on the situation, along with the request to retract the statement based on unsubstantiated claims which could potentially have an adverse impact on Pakistans exports and public perception in Sri Lanka.

        "content": "Labour leader Chris Hipkins was sworn in as New Zealands prime minister in a formal ceremony on Wednesday, following the resignation of outgoing Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern last week. The Labour party elected former COVID-19 Response and Police minister Hipkins, 44, to lead the party and the country on Sunday. This comes after the surprise resignation of Ardern, 42, who said she had no more in the tank to lead the country. Hundreds gathered in the grounds of Parliament as Ardern left for the final time, hugging each of her members of parliament in turn, with many looking visibly emotional. She then travelled to Government House, where she tendered her resignation to King Charles representative in New Zealand, Governor General Cindy Kiro. Hipkins and his deputy Carmel Sepuloni - the first person of Pacific Islander descent to hold the role - were then sworn in, in a ceremony lasting a few minutes. Hipkins, who has so far refused to comment on his policies since being elected leader, will hold his first cabinet meeting later on Wednesday. Known as Chippy, Hipkins is well-known to New Zealanders for his competence in tackling COVID-19, though he acknowledged some mistakes in handling the pandemic and faces a tough battle to retain power in an October general election. A 1News-Kantar poll released in December had Labours support falling to 33 from 40 at the start of 2022, meaning Labour would not be able to form a majority even with traditional coalition partner the Green Party at 9. The opposition National Party has benefited from Labours decline. Source - Reuters - Agencies",

The decision was taken at a meeting held yesterday (24 Jan.), in view of the recent and expected developments and projections on the domestic and global macroeconomic fronts. Accordingly, CBSL was of the view that the maintenance of the prevailing tight monetary policy stance is imperative to ensure that monetary conditions remain sufficiently tight to rein in inflationary pressures. Such tight monetary conditions, together with the tight fiscal policy, are expected to adjust inflation expectations downward, enabling the Central Bank to bring inflation rates towards the desired levels by end 2023, thereby restoring economic and price stability over the medium term, a statement issued by CBSL in this regard read.",

        "content": "At least 124 people died in freezing temperatures in Afghanistan in the past fortnight, Taliban officials say. About 70,000 livestock had also perished in what is the coldest winter in a decade, a State Ministry for Disaster Management spokesman said. Many aid agencies suspended operations in recent weeks after the Taliban banned Afghan women from working for non-governmental organisations. A Taliban minister said despite the deaths, the edict would not be changed. Acting Minister of Disaster Management Mullah Mohammad Abbas Akhund told the BBC that many areas of Afghanistan were now completely cut off by snow; military helicopters had been sent to the rescue, but they couldnt land in the most mountainous regions. The acting minister said the forecast for the next 10 days indicated temperatures would warm. But he was still worried about a rising death toll - of Afghans, and their livestock. Most of the people who lost their lives to the cold were shepherds or people living in rural areas. They didnt have access to healthcare, Mullah Akhund said. Were concerned about those who are still living in the mountain regions. Most of the roads which pass through the mountains have been closed due to snow. Cars have got stuck there and passengers have died in the freezing temperatures. Winters are always harsh here in Afghanistan but this is the worst weather in a decade. And this years relief operations are hampered by last months Taliban government edict barring Afghan women from working in aid agencies. But Mullah Akhund was categorical. This edict could not be lifted - the international community, he insisted, had to accept Afghanistans Islamic culture. Men are already working with us in the rescue effort and there is no need for women to work with us. The men from every family are already participating in relief efforts, so theres no need for women, he told the BBC. Aid officials, including the United Nations, are urgently trying to find ways to work around this ban. Source: BBC -Agencies",

        "content": "Everything Everywhere All At Once leads the field at this years Academy Awards, with 11 nominations. The madcap adventure follows a woman, played by Michelle Yeoh, who hops through the multiverses as different versions of herself. Other best picture nominees include Top Gun: Maverick, Avatar: The Way of Water and The Banshees of Inisherin. The acting nominees include Cate Blanchett, Brendan Fraser and Britains Andrea Riseborough and Bill Nighy. The top Oscar nominees: Everything Everywhere All at Once - 11 All Quiet on the Western Front - 9 The Banshees of Inisherin - 9 Elvis - 8 The Fabelmans - 7 Top Gun: Maverick - 6 Tar - 6 Black Panther: Wakanda Forever - 5 Avatar: The Way of Water - 4 Blanchett is nominated for leading actress for her performance in Tár, in which she plays a renowned orchestra conductor whose career starts to unravel when she is accused of abuse. British actress Riseborough was an outsider to be nominated in the same category for her role in To Leslie, but enjoyed a late surge thanks to celebrity endorsements from the likes of Gwyneth Paltrow, Susan Sarandon and Jennifer Aniston. Joining Blanchett and Riseborough on the shortlist are Yeoh, Michelle Williams (The Fablemans) and Ana de Armas (Blonde). De Armas portrayal of Marilyn Monroe has split opinion, though - Blonde also had the dubious honour of picking up several Razzie nominations - for the worst films of the year - earlier this week. Jamie Lee Curtis has received the first Oscar nomination of her long and varied career at 64, for her role as a tax inspector in Everything Everywhere All At Once. The best supporting actress category also provides a nomination for Angela Bassett for Black Panther: Wakanda Forever, which makes her the first person to get an acting nod for a Marvel film. Nighy has received his first Oscar nomination at the age of 73 for Living, in which he plays a civil servant whose outlook changes after he is diagnosed with a terminal illness. The other best actor nominees, are Fraser (The Whale), Austin Butler (Elvis) and Irish actors Colin Farrell (Banshees of Inisherin) and Paul Mescal (Aftersun). Normal People star Mescal is rewarded with his first Oscar nomination for playing a young Scottish father raising his 11-year-old daughter. It is a strong year for Ireland all-round. There was also a nomination in the best international film category for The Quiet Girl, about a shy young girl who goes to stay with her distant relatives for the summer. In the best supporting actor category, Brendan Gleeson and Barry Keoghan were both recognised for their roles in Martin McDonaghs Banshees, alongside co-star Kerry Condon for best supporting actress. It was also a strong year for actors of Asian descent, with four nominated - Yeoh, Ke Huy Quan, Stephanie Hsu and Hong Chau - the most in a single year. Quan found fame as a child actor in the mid-1980s in The Goonies and Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom but stopped acting when he found it hard to find roles. Everything Everywhere All At Once is his first major film for more than 30 years. Snubs and Surprises Viola Davis (The Woman King) and Danielle Deadwyler (Till) had both been tipped for nominations in the best actress race, but were notably snubbed by the Academy. Top Guns Tom Cruise and Babylon stars Brad Pitt and Margot Robbie were among the other big names to miss out. US actor Bryan Tyree Henry was a surprise inclusion on the supporting actor shortlist for playing a garage owner with a painful past opposite Jennifer Lawrence in Apples Causeway. Paul Dano had been expected to appear in the same category for his turn in The Fabelmans, but missed out - although co-star Judd Hirsch did make the cut. While its a good showing for Irish talent, Jessie Buckley also missed out on a best supporting actress nomination for her role in Women Talking. Sarah Polleys drama about abuse in a remote Mennonite community is the only film directed by a woman in the coveted best picture race - but no women were nominated in the best director category. The other films up for best picture include German war epic All Quiet on the Western Front, Baz Luhrmanns Elvis, Steven Spielbergs The Fablemens, Todd Fields Tar and Ruben Ostlunds Cannes winner Triangle of Sadness. In other categories, the BBCs adaptation of Charlie Mackesys best-selling book The Boy, the Mole, the Fox and the Horse - which was on TV over Christmas - is nominated for best animated short film.

        "title": "Rising prices, food insecurity add to ranks of hungry: UN agencies",
        "date": "January 25, 2023 09:30 am",
        "content": "Growing numbers of people in Asia lack enough to eat as food insecurity rises with higher prices and worsening poverty, according to a report released Tuesday by the Food and Agricultural Organization and other United Nations agencies. Nearly a half-billion people, more than eight in 10 of them in South Asia, were undernourished in 2021 and more than 1 billion faced moderate to severe food insecurity, the report said. For the world, the prevalence of food insecurity rose to more than 29 in 2021 from 21 in 2014. The COVID-19 pandemic was a huge setback, causing mass job losses and disruptions, and the war in Ukraine has pushed up prices for food, energy and fertilizer, putting an adequate diet out of the reach of many millions, it said. The report is the fifth annual stocktaking on food insecurity and hunger by U.N. agencies including the FAO, UNICEF, World Health Organization and World Food Program. Over those years, progress toward alleviating hunger and malnutrition has stalled and then backslid as growing numbers of people lost the wherewithal to get enough to eat. The prevalence of undernourishment as measured by the U.N. agencies was 9.1 in 2021, better than the 14.3 in 2000 but up slightly from 2020. Such figures show that the slowdown in the fight against hunger continues, said the report, which also highlights the growing food insecurity faced by people who have moved into cities, where they have less easy access to affordable food. Reforming our agrifood systems to produce nutritious food and ensure equitable access to healthy diets is critical, it said. The FAOs Food Price Index has risen in the past several years, hitting a record in March 2022. It fell back as commodity prices declined somewhat later in the year but is still 28 above the 2020 level. The Asia-Pacific region imports nearly 2 trillion of food a year. Rising prices for basics like rice, wheat and oil hit the poor the hardest. Its part of what the U.N. agencies call the 5F crisis of not enough food, feed, fertilizer, fuel and financing. The conflict in Ukraine has dealt a heavy blow in many countries that depended on the region for wheat, edible oils and fertilizers. Nearly 2 billion people  or almost 45 of people living in Asia  cannot afford healthy diets, contributing to problems with anemia and obesity as well as hunger. Underscoring the impact of the pandemic, which hit vulnerable workers in the tourism and manufacturing industries especially hard, nearly one in 10 Thais were undernourished in 2019-2021, according to data in the report  a higher proportion than several years earlier and also than in many other Southeast Asian countries where average incomes are much lower. Poverty already had risen by 2.6 between 2015-2018, according to World Bank data. An increase in poverty and in undernourishment would go together, Sridhar Dharmapuri, the FAOs author for the report released Tuesday, said in explaining the situation. Unhealthy diets and inadequate food are also compromising future health and productivity, as they cause children to suffer from stunting or wasting and make them more susceptible to illness. The report says nearly a quarter of children in the Asia-Pacific are affected by stunting, or small height for their ages. Some other details from the report:  In Afghanistan, 70 of people are facing moderate or severe food insecurity as the economy has collapsed after the Taliban seized power in August 2021, driving millions into poverty and hunger as foreign aid stopped almost overnight.  In Cambodia, half of the population faces moderate or severe food insecurity.  One-third of women in Asia aged 15-49 are affected by anemia, which causes fatigue and, in its most severe forms, can cause lung and heart damage. Source - The Associated Press -Agencies",

Thus, the Embassy urged all persons to follow only official source of information. A letter dated 18 January 2023 was recently seen widely circulated on social media, under the official letter head of the Chinese Embassy in Sri Lanka, addressed to President Ranil Wickremesinghe, the islands Minister of Finance. Accordingly, the letter noted that although China expresses deep concerns over Sri Lankas economic crisis, they are unable to amortise the outstanding debts, as their economy too, is still recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic. They further noted that the nations banking sector too is already stressed owing to the slowdown in the real estate sector. The letter stated, however, that China is ready to relax the repayment schedule by offering a 5-year moratorium on bilateral and commercial loan repayments. The Chinese Embassy in Sri Lanka clarifies that a letter circulating on social media, under its official letter head and written to Sri Lankan President  Financial Minister, is completely forged. Please follow the official sources of information. pic.twitter.comnf5ehZyj6g Chinese Embassy in Sri Lanka (ChinaEmbSL) January 24, 2023",

        "title": "Pope Francis says homosexuality is not a crime",
        "date": "January 25, 2023 01:47 pm",
        "content": "Pope Francis criticized laws that criminalize homosexuality as unjust, saying God loves all his children just as they are and called on Catholic bishops who support the laws to welcome LGBTQ people into the church. Being homosexual isnt a crime, Francis said during an interview Tuesday with The Associated Press. Francis acknowledged that Catholic bishops in some parts of the world support laws that criminalize homosexuality or discriminate against the LGBTQ community, and he himself referred to the issue in terms of sin. But he attributed such attitudes to cultural backgrounds, and said bishops in particular need to undergo a process of change to recognize the dignity of everyone. These bishops have to have a process of conversion, he said, adding that they should apply tenderness, please, as God has for each one of us. Some 67 countries or jurisdictions worldwide criminalize consensual same-sex sexual activity, 11 of which can or do impose the death penalty, according to The Human Dignity Trust, which works to end such laws. Experts say even where the laws are not enforced, they contribute to harassment, stigmatization and violence against LGBTQ people. In the U.S., more than a dozen states still have anti-sodomy laws on the books, despite a 2003 Supreme Court ruling declaring them unconstitutional. Gay rights advocates say the antiquated laws are used to harass homosexuals, and point to new legislation, such as the Dont say gay law in Florida, which forbids instruction on sexual orientation and gender identity in kindergarten through third grade, as evidence of continued efforts to marginalize LGBTQ people. The United Nations has repeatedly called for an end to laws criminalizing homosexuality outright, saying they violate rights to privacy and freedom from discrimination and are a breach of countries obligations under international law to protect the human rights of all people, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity. Declaring such laws unjust, Francis said the Catholic Church can and should work to put an end to them. It must do this. It must do this, he said. Francis quoted the Catechism of the Catholic Church in saying gays must be welcomed and respected, and should not be marginalized or discriminated against. We are all children of God, and God loves us as we are and for the strength that each of us fights for our dignity, Francis said, speaking to the AP in the Vatican hotel where he lives. Such laws are common in Africa and the Middle East and date from British colonial times or are inspired by Islamic law. Some Catholic bishops have strongly upheld them as consistent with Vatican teaching that considers homosexual activity intrinsically disordered, while others have called for them to be overturned as a violation of basic human dignity. In 2019, Francis had been expected to issue a statement opposing criminalization of homosexuality during a meeting with human rights groups that conducted research into the effects of such laws and so-called conversion therapies. In the end, the pope did not meet with the groups, which instead met with the Vatican No. 2, who reaffirmed the dignity of every human person and against every form of violence. On Tuesday, Francis said there needed to be a distinction between a crime and a sin with regard to homosexuality. Being homosexual is not a crime, he said. Its not a crime. Yes, but its a sin. Fine, but first lets distinguish between a sin and a crime. Its also a sin to lack charity with one another, he added. Catholic teaching holds that while gays must be treated with respect, homosexual acts are intrinsically disordered. Francis has not changed that teaching, but he has made reaching out to the LGBTQ community a hallmark of his papacy. Starting with his famous 2013 declaration, Who am I to judge? when he was asked about a purportedly gay priest, Francis has gone on to minister repeatedly and publicly to the gay and trans community. As archbishop of Buenos Aires, he favored granting legal protections to same-sex couples as an alternative to endorsing gay marriage, which Catholic doctrine forbids. Despite such outreach, Francis was criticized by the Catholic LGBTQ community for a 2021 decree from the Vaticans doctrine office that the church cannot bless same-sex unions because God cannot bless sin. The Vatican in 2008 declined to sign onto a U.N. declaration that called for the decriminalization of homosexuality, complaining the text went beyond the original scope and also included language about sexual orientation and gender identity it found problematic. In a statement at the time, the Vatican urged countries to avoid unjust discrimination against gays and end penalties against them. Source: Associated Press -Agencies",

Speaking at a press conference this afternoon (25 Jan) on Monetary Policy Review No. 01 of 2023, Dr. Weerasinghe noted that while India has given clear financial assurances to the IMF, which are acceptable by their standards, other bilateral creditors including China, the Paris Club and other smaller creditors are currently in the process of issuing these assurances. There have been a lot of significant communications happening between the IMF and the Paris Club and other non-Paris Club members, and also with our Minister of Finance. That process is making very good progress, the CBSL Governor stated, explaining that the issuance of financial assurances is a matter between the creditors and the IMF. He explained that initially, the creditors will issue the said letter to the IMF, following which the global money lender will decide whether the financial assurances received are sufficient to progress with the IMF board approval for the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) Sri Lanka is currently waiting on. As a result, we hope that IMF would be able to receive the necessary financial assurances from all the creditors in a very short period, he said in this regard.

Advanced Level examination is taking place. Accordingly, the secretary to the Power  Energy Ministry, chairman of the Public Utilities Commission (PUCSL), chairman of the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB), chairman of the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC), chairman of the Bank of Ceylon (BOC) and the chairman of the Peoples Bank have been summoned by the human rights body. Earlier today, PUCSL chairman Janaka Ratnayake, and Power  Energy Ministry secretary Sugath Dharmakeerthi were summoned to the HRCSL to look into the continuation of the scheduled power interruptions despite the ongoing Advanced Level examination. The meeting was also attended by several senior officials of the CEB including its additional general manager Ronald Comester. As an expeditious intervention is required to resolve the matters that came up during todays discussion, the HRCSL has decided to convene another urgent meeting this evening with the aforementioned officials. The PUCSL recently requested the CEB to refrain from imposing power cuts after 07.00 p.m. until the end of the Advanced Level examination, based on requests made by various parties including the Department of Examinations. However, the CEB later noted that power cuts will have to be imposed even during the period in which the exam will be held, owing to the high costs incurred for the generation of electricity, and the lack of funds in this regard. The Advanced Level examination began on Monday (Jan. 23) at 2,200 centres with 331,709 candidates sitting for the exams and will continue until February 17.",

Commissioner General of the Excise Department Saman Jayasinghe and other officials were present at the special discussion held with regard to the new draft Bill.",

        "content": "All parties including the Ministry of Power and Energy, the Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL), they Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) and the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) have agreed before the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka (HRCSL) to refrain from imposing power cuts during the 2022 GCE Advanced Level Examination. The HRCSL yesterday (24 Jan.) summoned the PUCSL Chairman Janaka Ratnayake and the Secretary to the Ministry of Power and Energy for an inquiry as to why they failed to prevent the implementation of power cuts during the ongoing examination. CEB Assistant General Manager Ronald Comester, the Additional Secretary to the Ministry of Power and Energy Sugath Dharmakeerthi and the PUCSL Chairman had appeared before the Commission. Accordingly, it was agreed upon at the inquiry held at the HRCSL premises that no power cuts will be imposed from today (25 Jan.) until 17 February, HRCSL said in a release. PUCSL, together with the HRCSL, proposed to CPC that the required fuel be provided to the CEB in order to provide an uninterrupted supply of electricity during the period in which the exam is being held. Thus, PUCSL advised the CEB to prioritise the securing of funds needed for this purpose when the proposed electricity tariff revision is implemented in the near future. Accordingly, all parties agreed that the relevant funds would be paid within 60 days, the statement further read. It further called on the Ministry of Power and Energy to intervene in the matter, and provide the necessary coordination required for this consensus. The HRCSL also decided to include this agreement as a recommendation, while the PUCSL also agreed to its implementation.",

        "title": "Justin Bieber sells music rights for 200 mn",
        "date": "January 25, 2023 07:31 pm",
        "content": "Pop juggernaut Justin Bieber has sold his music publishing and recording catalog shares to the Blackstone-backed Hipgnosis Songs Capital for 200 million, the company said Tuesday -- marking the industrys latest blockbuster rights deal. The sale has been rumored for weeks, and sees the 28-year-old join a whos who of artists who have cashed out recently on their catalogs. Hipgnosis did not publicly disclose terms of the deal, but a source close to the matter told AFP it was worth around 200 million. Contemporary stars including Justin Timberlake and Shakira have sold large stakes in their work -- both also struck deals with Hipgnosis -- but the move has mostly been seen among legacy artists like Bob Dylan and Bruce Springsteen. The staggering sums -- Springsteens catalog went to Sony for a reported half billion dollars -- are considered safe bets both for older artists getting their finances in order and investors who can count on consistent returns from time-tested music and the viability of streaming. Younger catalogs are seen as riskier territory, but Bieber is among the best-selling artists ever, and now Hipgnosis has his share in some of the 21st centurys biggest hits including Baby and Sorry. Hipgnosis Songs Capital is a 1 billion venture between financial giant Blackstone and the British Hipgnosis Song Management. Hipgnosis said they acquired Biebers interest in his publishing copyrights to his 290-song back catalog -- all of his music released prior to December 31, 2021. Biebers longtime home Universal will continue to administer the catalog, another source close to the deal said, and still owns the artists master recordings. Hipgnosis has acquired the artists stake in his masters as well as his neighboring rights -- a royalty that sees its owner receive a payment every time a song is played publicly. - Remarkable  After the Canada native was discovered on YouTube as a teen, Bieber skyrocketed to global fame, selling more than 150 million records. He has charted eight number-one records on Billboards top albums list, and his songs have streamed on Spotify alone more than 32 billion times. The impact of Justin Bieber on global culture over the last 14 years has truly been remarkable, said Hipgnosis chief Merck Mercuriadis, a longtime music industry executive, in a statement. At only 28 years of age, he is one of a handful of defining artists of the streaming era that has revitalized the entire music industry, taking a loyal and worldwide audience with him on a journey from teen phenomenon to culturally important artist. Biebers health has suffered recently, with the star going on an indefinite touring hiatus after he revealed hed been diagnosed with Ramsay Hunt Syndrome, a rare complication of shingles that for him caused partial facial paralysis. - Lucrative asset class  Music catalogs have always changed hands, but the current publishing sales boom had escalated rapidly, with financial markets increasingly drawn to lucrative music portfolios as an asset class. Mercuriadis Hipgnosis, which went public on the London Stock Exchange in 2018, has played a large part in publicizing the spike in sales. The sector had seemed to cool recently, but the Bieber deal shows investors are still hungry for music acquisitions. Owners of a songs publishing rights receive a cut in various scenarios, including radio play and streaming, album sales, and use in advertising and movies. Recording rights govern reproduction and distribution. The flurry of sales came amid a wider conversation over artists ownership of the work, amplified in large part by Taylor Swift, who has found resounding success as she re-records her first six albums so she can control their master recording rights. That move stemmed from Swifts very public feud with Scooter Braun, the music manager whose company once owned her original masters, and later sold them to the investment firm Shamrock Holdings. Braun has been Biebers manager for 15 years, and in a statement said when Justin made the decision to make a catalogue deal we quickly found the best partner to preserve and grow this amazing legacy was Merck and Hipgnosis. Justin is truly a once in a generation artist and that is reflected and acknowledged by the magnitude of this deal. Source  AFP -Agencies",

        "date": "January 25, 2023 08:30 pm",
        "content": "Ships searching in wind-whipped waters between South Korea and Japan have picked up at least 14 of the 22 crew members from a cargo vessel that sank early Wednesday, killing at least two, officials said. South Korean officials said nine of those rescued remain unconscious, but they did not immediately confirm any deaths. Ten crew members were later airlifted to Nagasaki in southern Japan for treatment, but two of them were confirmed dead on arrival, Japanese officials said. South Korean and Japanese coast guard vessels and aircraft as well as two commercial cargo ships were continuing to search for the eight missing crew members but the efforts were being slowed by strong winds and waves, South Korean officials said. The Japanese coast guard confirmed the rescue of at least 13 crew members and said five of them  all Chinese nationals  were still alive. The 6,551-ton Jin Tian sank about 3 12 hours after it sent a distress call at around 11:15 p.m. Tuesday in Japans exclusive economic zone, Japanese coast guard spokesperson Shinya Kitahara said. The vessel, which was Hong Kong registered and carrying lumber, sank about 160 kilometers (100 miles) southwest of Nagasaki, Japan, and about 150 kilometers (93 miles) south of South Koreas Jeju island. The captain last communicated with the coast guard through a satellite phone around 2:41 a.m., saying the crew would abandon the ship, minutes before it sank, Jeju island coast guard officials said. Six crew members were picked up by South Korean coast guard vessels, while a cargo ship picked up five and Japanese aircraft picked up three, according to Jejus coast guard. Officials said 14 crew members are Chinese and eight are from Myanmar. According to maritime transport websites, the vessel left Malaysias Port Klang on Dec. 3 and was headed for South Koreas Incheon port. The ship is owned by Long Bright Shipping Limited, a Hong Kong-registered company that is a subsidiary of Shenzhen Shekou Shipping Transportation Co., Ltd., according to a July 2022 filing made by the parent company to Chinas National Equities Exchange and Quotations. The filing says the Jin Tian was used as collateral for a loan that was later repaid. Calls to a number listed for Shenzhen Shekou Shipping Transportation in mainland China went unanswered on Wednesday during the weeklong Lunar New Year holiday. South Korean officials didnt immediately say whether the nine who were unconscious were likely to survive. They said the five other crew members who were rescued were either conscious when found or regained consciousness. Kitahara said the cause of the ships sinking was not immediately known and there were no signs that it collided with another vessel. He said the arrivals of Japanese patrol boats and aircraft were delayed by difficult weather. Officials at Jejus coast guard said a strong wind warning was issued for the area earlier on Wednesday but was later lifted. Winds were blowing at around 56 kilometers (35 miles) per hour, creating waves 3-4 meters (9-13 feet) high. The Japanese coast guard said the water in the area remained rough with a temperature of 14 degrees Celsius (57 degrees Fahrenheit). Source  The Associated Press -Agencies",

        "title": "Top prosecutor orders release of Beirut port blast detainees",
        "date": "January 25, 2023 10:51 pm",
        "content": "Lebanons top prosecutor Wednesday ordered all suspects detained in the investigation into the deadly 2020 port blast in Beirut released, a lawyer for two detainees and judicial officials said. The move by chief prosecutor Ghassan Oweidat is another blow to the investigation, which has stalled for years. The probe has threatened to rattle Lebanons ruling elite, which is rife with corruption and mismanagement and has helped push the country into an unprecedented economic meltdown. The decision came after Judge Tarek Bitar on Monday resumed the investigation into the devastating port blast, following a 13-month halt over legal challenges raised by politicians accused in the probe  including the chief prosecutor. Bitar in a statement Wednesday said Ouweidats decision to release the detainees was illegal and said he was committed to completing the investigation. Judge Ouweidat cannot charge a judge who previously charged him in the port investigation due to conflict of interests, Bitars statement read. Seventeen detainees have been held for years in pre-trial detention after the massive port blast on Aug. 4, 2020. Hundreds of tons of highly explosive ammonium nitrate, a material used in fertilizers, detonated at Beirut Port, killing 218 people, injuring over 6,000 and damaging large parts of the Lebanese capital. Lawyer Sakher El Hachem, who represents former port authority head Hassan Koraytem and a former port official, U.S. citizen Ziad al-Ouf, told The Associated Press that they received confirmation of the decision from the judiciary and that his clients would be released Wednesday. The judicial officials added that Ouweidat, who defied Bitars decision to resume the paralyzed investigation, will press charges against him. They spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the press. The officials added that Ouweidat sent a police officer to Bitars residence to notify him of the charges and instruct Bitar to visit his office, but the maverick investigator declined to speak with him. Ouweidat did not immediately respond to calls from the AP seeking comment. Mody Koraytem, the sister of the former port authority head, said the detainees release was long overdue and she claimed that they were all innocent. As port administration there wasnt anything they could have done about it (the ammonium nitrate), she said, adding that they did their jobs given that the judiciary cleared the deadly cargo to enter the port. Some of the detainees had already left prison by late afternoon Wednesday, including former customs chief Badri Daher. Oweidat did the right legal thing, his lawyer, Celine Atallah, said. Daher was not available for comment. Judge Bitar is the second investigator to lead the probe into the port blast, and has charged over a dozen senior political, security, port and security officials. On Monday, Bitar ordered the release of five of 17 detainees in the case and charged eight officials, among them top intelligence officials Maj. Gen. Abbas Ibrahim and Maj. Gen. Tony Saliba, as well as Oweidat. The judge also summoned at least 14 politicians and judicial, security and customs officials for questioning in February. Senior officials have repeatedly refused to show up for questioning since the start of the probe. Bitar took his post following the removal in February 2021 of Judge Fadi Sawwan over complaints of bias by two Cabinet ministers. If he is also removed, it could be the final blow to the investigation. Most families of the blasts victims have endorsed Bitar and called on authorities to allow for a thorough and unobstructed investigation. Some however have lost hope in a domestic probe and have advocated for a U.N.-mandated fact-finding mission. Lebanons political leadership have accused Bitar without evidence of being biased in his investigation, with some demanding his removal. Source -The Associated Press -Agencies",

        "date": "January 26, 2023 09:11 am",
        "content": "Debt-ridden Sri Lanka on Wednesday (Jan. 25) thanked India for issuing the necessary guarantees sought by the IMF that would help Colombo to unlock the USD 2.9 billion bailout package. Indias ministry of finance recently issued a letter to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to confirm its support to Sri Lanka on the issue of debt restructuring. Also, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar during his recent visit to Colombo gave the required assurances to Sri Lankas top leadership for the much-needed IMF bailout package, becoming the first major lender to publicly back the island nations efforts to recover from its worst-ever economic crisis. In a statement on Wednesday, the Governor of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka Nandalal Weerasinghe thanked India for issuing the necessary guarantees warranted by the IMF for unlocking the USD 2.9 billion bailout for the country. India has clearly given financial assurances which are acceptable to the IMF..which has all the necessary assurances ..first of all we should thank the Indian authorities for issuing that letter, Weerasinghe said. Sri Lanka, which is trying to secure a USD 2.9 billion bridge loan from the IMF, was negotiating to get financial assurances from its major creditors - China, Japan and India - which is the requisite for Colombo to get the bailout package. The IMF bailout has been put on hold as Sri Lanka pursues talks with creditors to meet the global lenders conditions for it. The Washington-based global lender has asked Sri Lanka to restructure its debt by negotiating with the creditors. On Sunday, China also gave Sri Lanka the financing assurances required by the IMF to unlock the bailout package. Weerasinghe said that the debt restructuring talks had made good progress. However, he declined to comment on the reported assurances issued by China to the Sri Lankan finance ministry that they would offer a 2-year repayment moratorium as its restructuring. The other creditors, the Paris Club and China are in the process of giving assurances. That process is making very good progress. It is a matter between the creditors and the IMF, he said. Speculation was rife that the Chinese debt moratorium offer was not what the IMF would require and that it had fallen short of the need. I dont think I can comment on that, Weerasinghe stressed when asked for a response to the Chinese position on the islands debt negotiations. Sri Lanka having missed its December 2022 target to obtain the facility now hopes for the release in the first quarter of 2023. The Central Bank said that the economic activity is expected to recover later in 2023, compared to the large contraction in 2022 It said that the real economy was estimated to have contracted by 7.1 per cent in the nine months ending September 2022, on a year-on-year basis. The island nations gross official reserves were estimated at USD 1.9 billion by the end of 2022 which includes a swap facility from China, equivalent to around USD 1.4 billion. Sri Lanka in April declared its first-ever debt default in its history as the economic crisis triggered by forex shortages sparked public protests. Months-long street protests led to the ouster of the then-president Gotabaya Rajapaksa in mid-July. Rajapaksa had started the IMF negotiations after refusing to tap the global lender for support. With assurances from creditors, the 2.9 billion dollar facility could get the IMF board approval in March, officials said. Source: PTI -Agencies",

        "date": "January 26, 2023 11:31 am",
        "content": "Chinas Export-Import Bank of China (EXIM) has provided Sri Lanka with a debt extension, Chinas foreign ministry said on Thursday, confirming a Reuters report earlier this week. EXIM offered Sri Lanka a two-year moratorium on its debt and said it would support the countrys efforts to secure a 2.9 billion loan from the International Monetary Fund, according to a letter reviewed by Reuters. Regional rivals China and India are the biggest bilateral lenders to Sri Lanka, a country of 22 million people that is facing its worst economic crisis in seven decades. China feels for Sri Lanka as it faces difficulties and challenges and has been helping with Sri Lankas socio-economic development as best as we can, the foreign ministry said in comments to Reuters. India wrote to the IMF earlier this month, saying it would commit to supporting Sri Lanka with financing and debt relief, but the island nation also needs the backing of China in order to reach a final agreement with the global lender. At the end of 2020, China EXIM loaned Sri Lanka 2.83 billion which is 3.5 of the islands debt, according to an IMF report released in March last year. EXIM is a policy bank tasked by Beijing with lending to governments and key industries globally. Commitments made to 100 developing nations by EXIM and the China Development Bank (CDB), the countrys two main policy lenders fell to a 13-year low of 3.7 billion in 2021 due to Beijing curtailing funding for large-scale oil projects, a study from Boston University Global Development Policy Center showed.

Speaking to Reuters, Kanda stated that Japan was working hard to help Sri Lanka, which is suffering its deepest economic crisis in 70 years, by coordinating with the Paris Club of creditor nations and the IMF to ensure the participation of non-members, including China and India, in efforts to restructure the island nations debt. It is desirable to work with these non-Paris Club countries in the same way with the Common Framework, he said, referring to a Group of 20 mechanism designed to provide a swift and comprehensive debt restructuring for nations facing difficulty meeting debt obligations after the COVID-19 shock to their economies. If this is realised, it would pave the way to carry out debt restructuring for other middle-income countries. Kanda said crisis-hit Sri Lanka was a key issue when it came to helping countries in debt but he was not sure when creditors aiming to extend it loans would meet. Kanda, who will oversee deputy-level negotiations on economic policy among the Group of Seven (G7) nations this year, said in an interview that while sanctions against Russia and support for Ukraine will be at top priority at G7 finance track under Japans chair of the G7, global debt problems too, would be at the top of the G7 agenda. - Agencies",

        "date": "January 26, 2023 01:02 pm",
        "content": "The Committee on Public Accounts (COPA) recently inquired into the Revenue Administration Management Information System (RAMIS) installed by the Inland Revenue Department (IRD) in 2014 by investing approximately Rs. 10 billion. At its meeting on Tuesday, the COPA revealed that it has received information alleging that the RAMIS, the computer system which was installed in an attempt to increase the efficiency of IRDs tax revenue collection, is not functioning properly. The COPA chairman MP Kabir Hashim, stating that more funds were likely to have already been spent on strengthening RAMIS, stressed that it is necessary to uncover whether the money spent on this software was put to good use. The Auditor General mentioned that the IRD is not providing him with information about the service agreement and relevant payment details related to the RAMIS. Taking issue with the departments refusal to provide particular information to him in compliance with the agreement, the Auditor General stressed that it is against the constitution. In response, the IRD officials stated that there this software system, which was started in 2014, needs to be updated with the new Inland Revenue Act brought in 2017. They further pointed out that there is a problem in giving out the contractual information, according to the agreement with the Singaporean company which created the above software system. Further, as this is an agreement reached between two governments, the intervention of the government will be appropriate for its future activities, the IRD officials noted. Accordingly, the COPA brought forth several proposals to make the work of the IRD more efficient by properly implementing the RAMIS. Taking into consideration the issues in many aspects of the RAMIS, including procurement, the COPA proposed to form two sub-committees to investigate the possibility of bringing this system to the operational level in a manner suitable for the country. The committee to be established jointly by the Attorney Generals Department under the leadership of the Finance Secretary will examine the legal conditions related to the RAMIS Agreement. Meanwhile, the committee to be established jointly with The University of Moratuwa, the Sri Lanka Information and Communication Technology Agency (ICTA), the Inland Revenue Department, and the Ministry of Finance will look into the possibility of updating the software system. It was also agreed to submit the reports containing the conclusions on the relevant matters to the COPA within 06 weeks.",

        "date": "January 26, 2023 02:12 pm",
        "content": "Ukraines president has thanked Western leaders for sending tanks to support the fight against Russia, but said they needed to be delivered quickly. In his nightly address, Volodymyr Zelensky also urged the West to send long-range missiles and fighter jets. His comments came after the US and Germany announced they would send Abrams and Leopard tanks to Ukraine. Russia condemned the announcement as a blatant provocation and said any supplied tanks would be destroyed. The tanks would burn like all the rest, said Dmitry Peskov, President Vladimir Putins spokesman. They are just very expensive. Zelensky said he told Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg that progress must be made in other aspects of our defence co-operation - with Ukraine seeking supplies of long-range missiles and artillery. He pressed not only for a prompt delivery of Western tanks but also for significant numbers: We must form such a tank force, such a freedom force that after it strikes, tyranny will never again rise up. While Mr Zelensky is likely to focus now on equipping the Ukrainian air force with more technologically advanced fighter jets after securing the tanks, many Western governments remain opposed to such a move - fearing the aircraft could be used to strike targets inside Russia. In his speech to the Bundestag in Berlin on Wednesday outlining the details of the tanks plan, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz insisted there would be no fighter jet deliveries to Ukraine. US President Joe Biden announced on Wednesday that the US would send 31 M1 Abrams battle tanks to Ukraine. The decision to deliver the tanks was announced hours after Germany said it would send 14 of its Leopard 2s to the Ukrainian battlefield. Berlin also cleared the way for other European countries to donate German-made tanks from their own stocks. Ukraine has lobbied Western allies to send the equipment for months. It hailed the twin announcements as a turning point that would allow its military to regain momentum and take back occupied territory almost a year after Moscow invaded. It also said the tanks could help deter a potential Russian offensive in the spring. Source - BBC -Agencies",

The group had departed from the Negombo fisheries harbour on 01 December 2022 on a multiday fishing trawler, and had proceeded towards the Diego Garcia Island, where they were apprehended and deported by the British Navy on 30 December 2022. Subsequently, however, the smuggler had cruised with the group of illegal immigrants towards Réunion Island in French territory, where they were held by the relevant authorities on 14 January. They were then produced before the Réunion Court, following which they were repatriated yesterday. The group, inclusive of 33 males, two females aged over 18 and two boys and a girl aged below 18, have been identified as residents of Jaffna, Vavuniya, Mannar, Kilinochchi, Mullaitivu, Trincomalee, Batticaloa Puttalam, Negombo and Gampaha, and were handed over to the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) for onward legal proceedings. The smugglers, identified as residents of Kalpitiya and Kandy, are believed to have charged sums ranging from Rs. 400,000 to Rs. 1 million per person, Sri Lanka Navy reported. Thus, the Sri Lanka Navy have urged the public to refrain from falling prey to such ploys, adding that the French Government too, does not entertain the illegal entry of people to the Réunion Island and such people will be immediately repatriated upon apprehension.",

        "date": "January 26, 2023 04:20 pm",
        "content": "Israeli forces killed at least nine Palestinians, including a 60-year-old woman, and wounded several others during a raid in a flashpoint area of the occupied West Bank on Thursday, Palestinian health officials said, in the deadliest day in years in the territory. The violence occurred during what Palestinian health officials described as a fierce operation in broad daylight in the Jenin refugee camp, a militant stronghold of the West Bank that has been a focus of nearly a year of Israeli arrest raids. The conflict spiked this month, with 29 Palestinians killed since the start of the year. It was not immediately clear how many of those killed Thursday were affiliated with armed groups. The fighting comes weeks into Israels new government, its most right-wing ever, which has pledged to take a hard line against the Palestinians and ramp up settlement construction on lands the Palestinian seek for their hoped-for state. It also comes days before U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is set to arrive in the region and push for steps that might improve daily life for the Palestinians. The Israeli military said it was conducting the rare daytime operation because of intelligence it had received that a militant grouping linked to the Palestinian Islamic Jihad, which has a major foothold in the camp, was set to carry out imminent attacks against Israelis. A gun battle erupted, during which the military said it targeted the militants. At least one of the dead was identified by Palestinians as a militant. Palestinian Health Minister May Al-Kaila said paramedics were struggling to reach the wounded amid the fighting. She also accused the military of firing tear gas at the pediatric ward of a hospital, causing children to choke. Video from the hospital showed women carrying children out of hospital rooms and into the corridor. The military said tear gas had likely wafted into the hospital from the clashes nearby. Jenin hospital identified the woman killed as Magda Obaid and the Israeli military said it was looking into reports of her death. The Palestinian Health Ministry earlier identified another one of the dead as Saeb Azriqi, 24, who was brought to a hospital in critical condition after being shot, and died from his wounds. And the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigade  an armed militia affiliated with Fatah, the secular political party that controls the Palestinian Authority, claimed one of the dead, Izz al-Din Salahat, as a fighter. The ministry said at least 20 people were wounded. Nabil Abu Rudeineh, a spokesman for the Palestinian Authority, condemned the violence, calling on the international community to speak out against it. Akram Rajoub, the governor of Jenin, told The Associated Press the military prevented medical teams from evacuating the wounded and fired tear gas that seeped into the government hospital, affecting infants and interrupting surgeries. The military said forces closed roads to facilitate their operation, which may have complicated the efforts of rescue teams to reach the wounded. We ask that the international community help the Palestinians against this extremist right-wing government and protect our citizens, he said. Tensions between Israelis and Palestinians have soared since Israel launched the raids last spring, following a spate of Palestinian attacks that killed 19 people, while another round of attacks later in the year brought the death toll to 30. Nearly 150 Palestinians were killed last year, making 2022 the deadliest since 2004, according to the Israeli rights group BTselem. Israel says most of the dead were militants. But youths protesting the incursions and others not involved in the confrontations have also been killed. So far this year, and not including Thursday, one-third of the Palestinians killed by Israeli troops or civilians had ties to armed groups. Israel says the raids are meant to dismantle militant networks and thwart future attacks. The Palestinians say they further entrench Israels 55-year, open-ended occupation. Israel captured the West Bank, east Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip in the 1967 Mideast war, territories the Palestinians claim for their hoped-for state. Israels new far-right government, headed by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and propped up by ultranationalist and ultra-Orthodox parties, has pledged to put West Bank settlement expansion at the top of its priority list and has already announced a series of punitive steps against the Palestinians for pushing the U.N.s highest judicial body to give its opinion on the Israeli occupation.

        "date": "January 26, 2023 05:05 pm",
        "content": "The Committee on Public Enterprises (COPE), taking issue with the pricing formula introduced for eggs, has instructed the respective officials to revisit the move, on account of various practicality concerns. A COPE meeting was convened on Wednesday (Jan. 25) under the chairmanship of MP Ranjith Bandara, a for four-pointer discussion as an extension of the committee meeting on January 19. Reportedly, yesterdays COPE meeting has focused on estimating the production cost reasonably for the purpose of setting a fair price for eggs in the market, safeguarding the domestic poultry industry, the egg shortage in the market and providing eggs to consumers at a fair price. Given the directive at the previous COPE meeting, the secretaries to the Trade Ministry and the Agriculture Ministry have presented a price formula to determine the price of an egg having calculated the relevant cost of an egg accordingly. Having discussed the formula presented and the matter of concern in depth, the COPE chairman has instructed the respective officials to revisit the pricing formula due to various practicality concerns in applying the formula presented. The officials who attended the meeting vowed to revisit the pricing formula, taking into consideration all matters discussed at the COPE meeting. When the focus of the meeting fell on safeguarding the domestic poultry industry, the COPE revealed that domestic producers representing the poultry industry have conveyed to the committee that if the price of an egg can be kept at Rs. 51 for a period of one and a half months until the poultry industry is stabilized, the price of an egg can be reduced further. The COPE was also of the view that whilst considering protecting the poultry industry, the respective authorities should also look at the context from the perspective of the consumer and act fair by all parties. It was disclosed at COPE that there exists a temporary dearth of approximately 3 million eggs per day. The officials present stated that there is no precipitated process in the poultry industry as a solution to this. Therefore, officials stated that it has been agreed upon to import a limited number of eggs to the industry in consideration of the consumer. Taking into consideration all factors presented before COPE, the Committee was of the view that all efforts must be made to find a solution to the matter at the discussion, which is fair to the consumer. Accordingly, the COPE chairman has instructed the respective officials to inform the public of the measures taken and to reassure that all parties are collectively working towards finding a practical solution to the matters of concern.",

        "date": "January 26, 2023 05:41 pm",
        "content": "Facebook parent Meta said Wednesday it will restore former President Donald Trump s personal account in the coming weeks, ending a two-year suspension it imposed in the wake of the Jan. 6 insurrection. The company said in a blog post it is adding new guardrails to ensure there are no repeat offenders who violate its rules, even if they are political candidates or world leaders. The public should be able to hear what their politicians are saying  the good, the bad and the ugly  so that they can make informed choices at the ballot box, wrote Nick Clegg, Metas vice president of global affairs. Clegg added that when there is a clear risk to real-world harm, Meta will intervene. In the event that Mr. Trump posts further violating content, the content will be removed and he will be suspended for between one month and two years, depending on the severity of the violation, he wrote. Facebook suspended Trump on Jan. 7, 2021, for praising people engaged in violent acts at the Capitol a day earlier. But the company had resisted earlier calls  including from its own employees  to remove Trumps account. Meta said Trumps accounts will be restored in the coming weeks on both Facebook and Instagram. Banned from mainstream social media, Trump has been relying on Truth Social, which he launched after being blocked from Twitter. Facebook is not only the worlds largest social media site, but had been a crucial source of fundraising revenue for Trumps campaigns, which spent millions of dollars on the companys ads in 2016 and 2020. The move, which comes as Trump is ramping up his third run for the White House, will not only allow Trump to communicate directly with his 34 million followers  dramatically more than the 4.8 million who currently follow him on Truth Social  but will also allow him to resume direct fundraising. During the suspension, his supporters were able to raise money for him, but couldnt run ads directly from him or in his voice. Responding to the news, Trump blasted Facebooks original decision to suspend his account as he praised Truth Social. FACEBOOK, which has lost Billions of Dollars in value since deplatforming your favorite President, me, has just announced that they are reinstating my account. Such a thing should never again happen to a sitting President, or anybody else who is not deserving of retribution! he wrote. Other social media companies, including Snapchat, where he remains suspended, also kicked him off their platforms following the insurrection. He was recently reinstated on Twitter after Elon Musk took over the company. He has not tweeted yet. Civil rights groups and others on the left were quick to denounce Metas move. Letting Trump back on Facebook sends a signal to other figures with large online audiences that they may break the rules without lasting consequences, said Heidi Beirich, founder of the Global Project Against Hate and Extremism and a member of a group called the Real Facebook Oversight Board that has criticized the platforms efforts. I am not surprised but it is a disaster, Beirich said of Metas decision. Facebook created loopholes for Trump that he went right through. He incited an insurrection on Facebook. And now hes back. NAACP President Derrick Johnson blasted the decision as a prime example of putting profits above peoples safety and a grave mistake. Its quite astonishing that one can spew hatred, fuel conspiracies, and incite a violent insurrection at our nations Capitol building, and Mark Zuckerberg still believes that is not enough to remove someone from his platforms, he said. But Jameel Jaffer, executive director of the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University called the reinstatement the right call  not because the former president has any right to be on the platform but because the public has an interest in hearing directly from candidates for political office. The ACLU also called it the right move. Like it or not, President Trump is one of the countrys leading political figures and the public has a strong interest in hearing his speech. Indeed, some of Trumps most offensive social media posts ended up being critical evidence in lawsuits filed against him and his administration, said Anthony D. Romero, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union. The biggest social media companies are central actors when it comes to our collective ability to speak  and hear the speech of others  online. They should err on the side of allowing a wide range of political speech, even when it offends. Clegg said that in light of his previous violations, Trump now faces heightened penalties for repeat offenses. Such penalties will apply to other public figures whose accounts are reinstated from suspensions related to civil unrest under our updated protocol. If Trump  or anyone else  posts material that doesnt violate Facebooks rules but is otherwise harmful and could lead to events such as the Jan. 6 insurrection, Meta says it will not remove it but it may limit its reach. This includes praising the QAnon conspiracy theory or trying to delegitimize an upcoming election. While Trump has insisted publicly that he has no intention of returning to Twitter, he has been discussing doing so in recent weeks, according to two people familiar with the plans who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations. Though it has been eclipsed culturally by newer rivals like TikTok, Facebook remains the worlds largest social media site and is an incredibly powerful political platform, particularly among older Americans, who are most likely to vote and give money to campaigns. Throughout his tenure as president, Trumps use of social media posed a significant challenge to major social media platforms trying to balance the publics need to hear from their elected leaders with worries about misinformation, harassment and incitement of violence. In a healthier information ecosystem, the decisions of a single company would not carry such immense political significance, and we hope that new platforms will emerge to challenge the hegemony of the social media giants, the ACLUs Romero said.

        "date": "January 26, 2023 10:31 pm",
        "content": "A company owned by Asias richest man has hit back at a report which accused the firm of brazen stock manipulation and accounting fraud. The Adani Group, founded by Gautam Adani, called the report by a US investment firm malicious and selective misinformation. The group lost almost 11bn (8.7bn) of its market value after the research was made public on Wednesday. It is now considering legal action against New Yorks Hindenburg Research. Adani Group is one of Indias biggest companies, and has operations in a wide range of industries including commodities trading, airports, utilities and renewable energy. It is led by Indian billionaire Mr Adani who is the worlds fourth richest man, according to Forbes magazine. Hindenburg, meanwhile, specialises in short-selling, or betting against a companys share price in the expectation that it will fall. In its report, Hindenburg accused Mr Adani of pulling the largest con in corporate history. This came days ahead of a planned sale of Adani Group shares to the public. The report questioned the Adani Groups ownership of companies in offshore tax havens such as Mauritius and the Caribbean. It also claimed Adani companies had substantial debt which put the entire group on a precarious financial footing. But on Thursday, Adani Group said it was evaluating remedial and punitive action against Hindenburg Research in the US and India. Adani said it had always been in compliance with all laws. The volatility in Indian stock markets created by the report is of great concern and has led to unwanted anguish for Indian citizens, said the group head of Adanis legal team, Jatin Jalundhwala. Clearly, the report and its unsubstantiated contents were designed to have a deleterious effect on the share values of Adani Group companies as Hindenburg Research, by their own admission, is positioned to benefit from a slide in Adani shares. The groups flagship firm, Adani Enterprises, is scheduled to begin selling its shares to the public on Friday. Political response Opposition politicians who have long alleged that Mr Adani has benefitted because of his proximity to Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi have been quick to react to the report. Considering that detailed research is out in the public domain, it is important that the government of India takes note of the charges made, tweeted Priyanka Chaturvedi, member of parliament and a Shiv Sena party leader. Another popular South Indian politician, Mr KT Ramarao, called on Indias investigative agencies and market regulator to open a probe into the Adani Groups operations. But regulators are unlikely to initiate any action independently, say experts. The Security and Exchange Board of India which regulates listed companies in India will act only if there is a specific complaint sent to it. And in this case there isnt, said Shriram Subramaniam, founder and managing director of InGovern Research, a consultancy that advises investors on governance issues. There are many allegations in the report that have been the subject of regulatory scrutiny in the past. The BBC contacted the market regulator but received no response. While it appears that the decks are clear for Adani Group to proceed with its 2.4bn public share sale on Friday, the allegations in the report could put some investors off, said Ambareesh Baliga, a financial markets analyst. But the report could have broader consequences that go beyond the Adani Group. Andy Mukherjee, a columnist at the news service Bloomberg, said there were many questions about the integrity of the broader Indian market, which is caught between the pressures of financial globalisation and political nationalism. He added: Is the Security and Exchange Board of India waiting for a public outcry to go in and clean up the market? Source: BBC -Agencies",

        "date": "January 26, 2023 11:41 pm",
        "content": "The Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka (HRCSL) has warned that it would seek legal action if the relevant authorities fail to provide an uninterrupted power supply while the 2022 G.C.E. Advanced Level is taking place. In a press release, the human rights body vowed to present facts to the Supreme Court if the power cuts are imposed during the exam month (from January 23 to February 17), pursuant to the provisions of Article 21 of the HRCSL Act No. 21 of 1996, which states that every offence of contempt committed against or in disrespect of, the authority of the commission is punishable by the Supreme Court. On Wednesday evening (Jan. 25), the HRCSL convened an urgent meeting with the top officials of the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB), the Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL) and the Ministry of Power  Energy, Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC), during which an agreement was reached not to impose power cuts during this period in order to minimize the inconvenience caused to the students sitting for the exam. At this meeting, the PUCSL, together with the HRCSL, proposed to the CPC that the required fuel be provided to the CEB in order to provide an uninterrupted supply of electricity during the exam month. Thus, PUCSL advised the CEB to prioritise the securing of funds needed for this purpose when the proposed electricity tariff revision is implemented in the near future. Accordingly, all stakeholders agreed that the relevant funds would be paid within 60 days. The Ministry of Power and Energy was urged to intervene in the matter and provide the necessary coordination required for this consensus. However, despite the undertaking given at the meeting called by the human rights body, it was reported that the daily power cuts were imposed as per usual since last night. Meanwhile, CEB chairman Nalinda Illangakoon is of the view that an additional sum of LKR 4.1 billion is required to provide an uninterrupted supply of power during the Advanced Level exam. Speaking on the matter, he mentioned that the daily power interruptions will have to continue unless this additional cost is covered.",

        "content": "The bilateral exercise titled Cooperation Afloat Readiness and Training (CARAT) 2023 successfully concluded in Sri Lanka on Thursday (Jan. 26). Hosted by the U.S. Pacific Fleet, in partnership with Sri Lanka Navy, CARAT 2023 was held in Colombo, Trincomalee and Mullikulam from January 19-25. The closing ceremony of CARAT 2023 was held on board USS Anchorage at the pier side of Colombo harbour under the auspices of U.S. Ambassador to Sri Lanka, Julie Chung; Commander of the Navy, Vice Admiral Priyantha Perera; and U.S. Seventh Fleet Vice Commander, Rear Admiral Joaquin J. Martinez de Pinillo. Meanwhile, the closing ceremony at the Naval Dockyard, Trincomalee was presided by the Commander of Eastern Naval Area and Commandant Volunteer Naval Force, Rear Admiral Dammika Kumara and Lieutenant Max Cutchen of the U.S. Navy on Thursday. Similarly, Commander Northwestern Naval Area, Rear Admiral Nishantha Peiris and Captain Shan Mandrayar of the 4th Marines of U.S. Marine Corps drew the curtain on the proceedings of CARAT 2023 at Mullikulam on Wednesday (Jan. 25). Symbolizing cooperation and goodwill, mementoes were also exchanged on these occasions. CARAT Sri Lanka is a bilateral exercise between Sri Lanka and the United States designed to promote regional security cooperation, maintain and strengthen maritime partnerships, enhance maritime interoperability and preserve a free and open Indo-Pacific region. The bilateral exercise was augmented by Sri Lanka Navy, Sri Lanka Coast Guard and Sri Lanka Air Force. In addition, the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force and Maldives National Defence Force also attended as observing partners. The exercise consisted of both land and sea phases where SLNS Gajabahu and SLNS Samudura of Sri Lanka Navy conducted naval exercises with USS Anchorage of the U.S. Navy. The exercises conducted in the sea phase mainly focused on Divisional Tactics (DIVTACs), Visit Board Search  Seizure (VBSS) Operations, Replenishment at Sea (RAS), Overhead Reconnaissance Exercises, Gunnery Exercises (GUNEX), Photo Exercises (PHOTOEX) and Steam Past Exercises. The Marine Exercises of the land phase of CARAT 2023 got underway on the beach and sea areas of Mullikulam. Chief among the exercises were; Tactical Combat Casualty Care - TCCC), Jungle Warfare, Military Operation in Urban Terrain (MOUT) and Rescue Operation, Humanitarian Assistance  Disaster Relief (HADR) Exercises, Day and Night Patrols and Ambush, Firing and Combat Lifesaving Exercises. The exercises were carried out by personnel of Sri Lanka Navy Marines, Special Boat Squadron, Rapid Action Boat Squadron, Naval Infantrymen, and U.S. Marine Corps. In the Naval Dockyard Trincomalee, the CARAT 2023 partners successfully conducted Special Boat Squadron Exercises, Diving and Salvage Exercises, Explosive Ordnance Disposal Exercises, Riverine Exercise, Mine Exercises as well as Small Unmanned Aircraft System (SUAS) Exercises. On the sidelines of CARAT 2023, seminars on law and order, enforcement of maritime law and the role of women as well as programmes to strengthen relationships through sports, cultural, and information exchanges were held with the contribution of the U.S. and Sri Lanka navies. Sri Lanka Navy, in a statement, pointed out that taking part in exercises of this nature would permit it to gain valuable experience and training by working alongside a more experienced and well-equipped navy like the U.S. Navy. This can be particularly valuable in situations where multiple navies are required to work together when responding to nontraditional maritime threats as well as common maritime challenges. An official from the U.S. Embassy in Colombo, the diplomatic corps, Presidents Chief of Staff and Senior Advisor to the President on National Security Sagala Ratnayaka, ministers, officials, Commander of the Army Lieutenant General Vikum Liyanage, Commander of the Air Force Air Marshal Sudarshana Pathirana and a group of senior officers from the tri-services were also present on this occasion.",

        "title": "Former top FBI official arrested in U.S. while returning from Sri Lanka",
        "date": "January 27, 2023 10:40 am",
        "content": "A former top FBI official in New York has been arrested over his ties to a Russian oligarch, law enforcement sources told ABC News Monday. Charles McGonigal, who was the special agent in charge of counterintelligence in the FBIs New York Field Office, is under arrest over his ties to Oleg Deripaska, a Russian billionaire who has been sanctioned by the United States and criminally charged last year with violating those sanctions. McGonigal retired from the FBI in 2018. He was arrested Saturday afternoon after he arrived at JFK Airport following travel in Sri Lanka, the sources said. McGonigal pleaded not guilty to the four-count indictment unsealed Monday in Manhattan. The judge ordered him released on a 500,000 personal recognizance bond plus restrictions on his travel and prohibitions on contacting anyone associated with the case. He was charged along with a court interpreter, Sergey Shestakov, who also worked with Deripaska. McGonigal, 54, is charged with violating U.S. sanctions by trying to get Deripaska off the sanctions list. McGonigal is one of the highest ranking former FBI officials ever charged with a crime. Charlie has had a long, distinguished career with the FBI. Hes served the United States for decades, McGonigals lawyer, Seth DuCharme, told ABC News in a statement. This is obviously a distressing day for Mr. McGonigal and his family, but well review the evidence, well closely scrutinize it, and we have a lot of confidence in Mr. McGonigal. McGonigal and Shestakov, who worked for the FBI investigating oligarchs, allegedly agreed in 2021 to investigate a rival Russian oligarch in return for payments from Deripaska, according to the Justice Department. McGonigal and Shestakov are accused of receiving payments through shell companies and forging signatures in order to keep it a secret that Deripaska was paying them. Both face money laundering charges in addition to charges for violating sanctions. Each of four counts carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison. The FBI is committed to the enforcement of economic sanctions designed to protect the United States and our allies, especially against hostile activities of a foreign government and its actors, FBI Assistant Director in Charge Michael Driscoll said in a statement. Russian oligarchs like Oleg Deripaska perform global malign influence on behalf of the Kremlin and are associated with acts of bribery, extortion, and violence. Driscoll continued, As alleged, Mr. McGonigal and Mr. Shestakov, both U.S. citizens, acted on behalf of Deripaska and fraudulently used a U.S. entity to obscure their activity in violation of U.S. sanctions. After sanctions are imposed, they must be enforced equally against all U.S. citizens in order to be successful. There are no exceptions for anyone, including a former FBI official like Mr. McGonigal. After leaving the FBI, McGonigal subsequently worked for Deripaska through a law firm representing the Russian oil tycoon. He made at least 25,000 working as an investigator for the law firm on the Deripaska matter, according to the indictment. McGonigal then worked directly for Deripaska, getting an initial payment of 51,000 and then payments of 41,790 each month for three months from August 2021 to November 2021. He told friends he was working for a rich Russian guy, according to the indictment, and stressed his work was legal. In conversations about Deripaska, he would often be referred to by McGonigal and Shestakov as the big guy and you know whom. The U.S. Attorneys Office in Washington, D.C., unsealed a separate case Monday against McGonigal on charges he received 225,000 in cash from an individual with business interests in Europe who McGonigal knew was an employee of a foreign intelligence service. The nine-count indictment alleges between August 2017 and September 2018, leading up to his retirement from the FBI New York Field Office, McGonigal concealed from the bureau his relationship with this unidentified former foreign intelligence officer all while traveling abroad with the person and meeting foreign nationals. The person is described as an Albanian national who was employed by a Chinese energy conglomerate. The person later served as an FBI source in a criminal investigation involving foreign political lobbying over which McGonigal had a supervisory role. In the court appearance in Manhattan Monday, assistant U.S. Attorney Derek Wikstrom said McGonigal would appear virtually Wednesday before a federal judge in D.C. to be arraigned on allegedly taking 225,000 from the Albanian businessman. A lawyer for McGonigal has not responded to ABC News request for comment. Shestakov, 69, who was living in Morris, Connecticut, also allegedly lied to FBI investigators in November 2021 about his relationship with Deripaska. In addition to the other charges, he has been charged with one count of making false statements. Deripaska, an aluminum magnate, was among two dozen Russians sanctioned in 2018 by the Treasury Department as punishment for the Russian governments ongoing and increasingly malign activities in the world, according to Treasury officials. The FBI searched his homes in New York and Washington in 2021. The 55-year-old Deripaska is worth 1.7 billion, according to Forbes Billionaires List, though he was worth nearly 7 billion in 2018 -- the same year sanctions kicked in by the U.S. Source: ABC News -Agencies",

On Wednesday evening (25 Jan.), the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka (HRCSL) convened an urgent meeting with the top officials of the CEB, the Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL) ,the Ministry of Power  Energy and the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC), during which an agreement was reached not to impose power cuts during this period in order to minimize the inconvenience caused to the students sitting for the exam. Thus, the HRCSL yesterday warned that it would seek legal action if the relevant authorities fail to provide an uninterrupted power supply during the period in which the exam is being held. The 2022 GCE Advanced Level Examination began on 23 January, and is scheduled to go on until 17 February.",

Accordingly, Sirisena was warned over his failure to be present in the defendants dock when a case against him was called in open court this morning (27 Jan.). The private case filed against the former President over his failure to prevent the Easter Attacks of 2019, despite having received intelligene in this regard prior to the attacks, was taken up in open court today. The case, which was filed by Father Cyril Gamini and another who had lost his leg at the bombing that took place at St. Anthonys Church in Kochchikade, is due to be taken up on 17 March. The former President did not get into defendants dock when the case was first called, after which Presidents Counsel (PC) Rienzie Arsekularatne, appearing on behalf of the plaintiff, brought the courts attention to the incident. Sirisenas legal representation, PC Faiszer Musthapha, subsequently noted that there was no need for Sirisena to get into the defendants dock as the Court of Appeal had suspended further action with regard to the case. Fort Magistrate Thilina Gamage noted, however, that the Court of Appeal had ordered that the charge sheet against the suspect be read out by the Magistrates Court. He further noted that although an order was issued by the Court of Appeal preventing any further action be taken in this regard until an order is issued by the Court, an order preventing the suspect from getting into the defendants dock had not been issued. The former President was then seen getting into the defendants dock when he was summoned for a second time.",

        "date": "January 27, 2023 03:11 pm",
        "content": "A US military operation killed a senior ISIS leader and 10 members of the terror group in northern Somalia on Wednesday, two senior Biden administration officials said on Thursday. From a mountainous cave complex in northern Somalia, Bilal al-Sudani is assessed to have supported ISIS expansion and activities across Africa and beyond the continent, the first senior administration official said. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin confirmed that al-Sudani had been killed in a statement later on Thursday. On January 25, on orders from the President, the U.S. military conducted an assault operation in northern Somalia that resulted in the death of a number of ISIS members, including Bilal-al-Sudani, an ISIS leader in Somalia and a key facilitator for ISISs global network. Al-Sudani was responsible for fostering the growing presence of ISIS in Africa and for funding the groups operations worldwide, including in Afghanistan, Austin said. No civilians were harmed as a result of this operation. We are grateful to our extraordinary service members as well as our intelligence community and other interagency partners for their support to this successful counterterrorism operation, Austin added. US forces, according to the official, were prepared to capture al-Sudani but the hostile forces response ultimately resulted in his death. No US troops or civilians were killed, although one service member was injured during the operation after being bitten by an American military dog. The second official said that the US notified two counterterrorism partners, including the Somali government. Its unusual for the US to carry out an operation against ISIS in Somalia, where military operations have typically focused on al-Shabaab fighters, the dominant terror group in Somalia. The strike comes after US forces killed two top ISIS leaders in an airstrike in Syria near the end of last year. The operation represents the continuation of the Biden administrations strategy to counter terrorist threats through over-the-horizon operations like this, a shift in strategy the president made clear following the US withdrawal from Afghanistan. Al-Sudani was sanctioned by the US treasury in 2012 for helping foreign fighters travel to an al-Shabaab training camp and facilitating financing, according to the first official. The operation, according to the first official, is expected to provide valuable information for the US intelligence community, although they declined to go into specifics. The operation was announced by US Africa Command (AFRICOM) on Thursday, which said only that the US military conducted a successful counterterrorism operation in Somalia and that no civilians were injured or killed. The second senior administration official said on Thursday that senior members of President Joe Bidens national security team were first briefed on the intelligence that led to this operation a number of months ago. Biden authorized the operation earlier this week. The first official declined to provide details on the service members who were involved in the operation but emphasized their exceptional preparation for the mission. Source - CNN - Agencies",
