        "date": "November 25, 2024 04:02 pm",
        "content": "The Supreme Court has fixed for consideration on December 12, a Fundamental Rights (FR) petition filed seeking an interim injunction suspending the holding of 2024 G.C.E. Advanced Level examination. This order was issued when the relevant petition filed by a candidate of the examination was taken up before the three-member Supreme Court judge bench comprising Chief Justice Murdu Fernando, Justices Jayantha Jayasuriya and Priyantha Fernando today (25). The FR petition has been filed by A.M. Hansani Kaveesha, a candidate of the examination who is residing in Kegalle, naming the Commissioner General of Examinations, Education Minister Dr. Harini Amarasuriya, Secretary to the Ministry of Education and the Attorney General as respondents. The petitioner claims that according to a circular issued by the Ministry of Education on November 29, 2023, it is stated that 170 days of classes should be held in government schools, government-approved private schools and Pirivenas for the academic year 2024. She has alleged that however, the decision taken to hold the G.C.E. Advanced Level examination before the completion of the 170-day study period is a grave injustice to the students appearing for the examination. The petition also points out that serious injustice is being inflicted on nearly 300,000 students who are appearing for the examination for the first time this year. Accordingly, the petitioner has requested a ruling that their fundamental human rights have been violated by holding the G.C.E. Advanced Level examination before the completion of the 170-day study period, and an order invalidating the decision to hold the examination from November 25 to December 20. Furthermore, the petition further requests that an interim injunction be issued to suspending the holding of the examination until this petition is heard and a final verdict is issued. However, appearing for the petitioner, Presidents Counsel Tirantha Walaliyadde requested that the petition be amended and a date be given for confirmation of the facts. Accordingly, the court granted permission to file an amended petition and ordered that the relevant petition be called on December 12 for confirmation of the facts. The 2024 AL examination commenced at 8.30 a.m. today (25) across 2,312 centers nationwide. This year, a total of 333,185 candidates are sitting for the G.C.E. Advanced Level Examination.",

        "content": "The Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL) has granted the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) an extension of two weeks for electricity tariff revision submission until December 6, 2024. In a letter to the CEB, the PUCSL further stated that accordingly, considering time taken for tariff approval process according to the Sri Lanka Electricity Act of 2009, approved Tariff Methodology and Tariff Review Procedure Rules, the earliest possible date for tariff approval will be January 17, 2025. The PUCSL also mentioned that in case of failure to submit tariff proposal by December 6, 2024, the Commission will be compelled to implement the tariff revision clause of the Bulk Supply Transaction operational guideline to pass the positive balance of Bulk Supply Transaction Account to consumers. On Sunday (24), the PUCSL stated that there will be no revision of electricity tariffs for 2024, citing delays in the submission of necessary proposals by the CEB. The PUCSL Corporate Communications Director, Jayanath Herath pointed out that the CEB submitted an initial set of tariff revision proposals at the end of September. However, the PUCSL deemed the proposed reductions insufficient and requested a revised submission by November 8. Despite the initial deadline, the CEB sought multiple extensions, most recently requesting an additional two weeks after failing to meet the extended deadline of November 22. Consequently, the PUCSL has granted the extension until December 6. Even if the CEB submits the revised proposals on December 6, the PUCSL clarified that it would take six to eight weeks to review and finalize the tariff adjustments. As a result, any potential revisions to electricity tariffs will be postponed to 2025.",

In her address, Prime Minister Dr. Harini Amarasuriya congratulated the newly elected members of Parliament, stating: I extend my congratulations to all of you who have been elected to serve as members of the Tenth Parliament. This Parliament holds a historic and special significance. We must approach our duties with a profound understanding of the responsibilities this institution entails. This Parliament is historic for several reasons. Notably, 22 female MPs have been elected, marking the highest representation of women in our parliamentary history. Furthermore, 162 out of the 225 MPs are newly elected members. This remarkable turnover reflects the publics sentiment and the rejection of previous parliamentary practices. The people of our country, who are politically mature, have sent a strong message through the general election. All MPs, irrespective of their positions, must recognize that they are first and foremost representatives of the people. Whether holding ministerial or deputy ministerial positions, we must prioritize the hopes and trust placed in us by the citizens. The disapproval of Parliament in recent years can only be reversed if we collectively work to meet the peoples expectations and uphold their aspirations. This Parliament must serve as a turning point in our political practice, and this workshop plays a crucial role in equipping us to innovate parliamentary procedures while preserving its traditions.

So, I went to the front and sat down. We approached the situation casually, as if we were on the university. We didnt raise our hands and come to Parliament intentionally. I assumed I could sit wherever I wanted. Later, four people approached me and informed me that this was the seat reserved for the Leader of the Opposition. I thought that he could also sit on another seat. I had no specific reason to sit on that chair. I feel deeply saddened by the accusations on social media claiming that I am a Tigerthat a Tiger sat in the Opposition Leader s seat. Let me clarifyI didnt sit there deliberately or with any ill intent. I came to Parliament independently and without the support of any political party.

Accordingly, the Cabinet of Ministers has approved the proposal submitted by President Anura Kumara Dissanayake, in his capacity as the Minister of Finance, Planning and Economic Development, to prepare the Budget for the year 2025 in such a way that the necessary provisions can be made to implement the projects and programs identified by each Ministry under the scope of the Ministry, subject to the expenditure limits specified in the Public Finance Management Act, No. 44 of 2024 and in accordance with the Government Policy Statement. Meanwhile, the Cabinet of Ministers has also granted approval to prepare an Interim Vote on Account for the first 04 months of the year 2025, including government recurrent and capital expenditure, public debt servicing and debt restructuring expenses. Dr. Jayatissa said that the decision was taken in view of the insufficient time to follow the statutory steps required to pass the Appropriation Bill for the year 2025. Therefore, as provided for in Section 23(1) of the Public Finance Management Act, No. 44 of 2024, an Interim Vote on Account will be presented to Parliament for the allocation of funds required for the maintenance of ongoing projects and public services for the first 04 months of the year 2025. The relevant parliamentary debate will be held on December 5 and 6, according to the Cabinet Spokesman.",

In June 2024, the Government of Sri Lanka reached a final agreement on a debt restructuring with members of the Official Creditor Committee (OCC) of major bilateral lenders. In September 2024, an agreement in principle was reached with international bondholders on a sovereign debt restructuring of approximately USD 14.2 billion in principle, following consensus discussions with the AdHoc Bond Holders, a group of international investors representing sovereign bondholders, and the Local Consortium of Sri Lanka. Accordingly, the Cabinet approval has been granted for the proposal presented by President Anura Kumara Dissanayake for the restructuring of international sovereign bonds by way of swapping existing bonds for new bonds following an analysis conducted by the Financial and Legal Advisors of the Government of Sri Lanka on the impact on the Sri Lankan economy, taking into account the composition of Sri Lankas international sovereign debt, investors and settlements, and in accordance with the parameters indicated in the debt sustainability analysis conducted by the IMF under the provisions of the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) program for Sri Lanka.",

        "content": "The Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) has strongly refuted recent claims regarding the revision of electricity tariffs. Addressing the controversy, the CEB clarified its position on a proposal submitted to the Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL) on October 24, 2024, which recommended a reduction in electricity tariffs by a range of 6 to 11. Issuing a statement, the CEB said that this proposal was based on projected expenses for the final quarter of 2024, revenue data from the second and third quarters, and the repayment of loans incurred during 20142022. The submission was made following the current tariff calculation methodology, it added, noting that however, the electricity sector regulator rejected the proposal, citing the need to implement any tariff revisions considering the first six months of 2025, rather than the last quarter of 2024. The regulator requested the CEB to redraft the proposal and submit it by December 6, 2024. This would ensure adequate time to prepare a revised tariff plan that aligns with the updated methodology and is effective from 2025, it added. Furthermore, the CEB expressed its inability to implement tariff reductions for the final quarter of 2024 due to the regulators decision to revise the calculation methodology which was used during the first three quarters of the year 2024. The CEB highlighted challenges faced between 2014 and 2022, during which loans were taken to address operational costs, noting that despite approving expenditures during this period, the regulator did not revise electricity tariffs to accommodate the increased financial burden. The CEB reiterated its role in estimating electricity costs and proposing tariff revisions in a manner that balances operational costs and consumer interests. The board affirmed its commitment to submitting a fair and reasonable tariff proposal that ensures affordability for consumers while maintaining the sustainability of the electricity sector.",

        "title": "Trump vows new Canada, Mexico, China tariffs that threaten global trade",
        "date": "November 26, 2024 01:03 pm",
        "content": "President-elect Donald Trump on Monday pledged big tariffs on the United States three largest trading partners - Canada, Mexico and China - detailing how he will implement campaign promises that could trigger trade wars. Trump, who takes office on Jan. 20, 2025, said he would impose a 25 tariff on imports from Canada and Mexico until they clamped down on drugs, particularly fentanyl, and migrants crossing the border, in a move that would appear to violate a free-trade deal. Trump also outlined an additional 10 tariff, above any additional tariffs on imports from China, in some of his most specific comments on how he will implement his economic agenda since winning the Nov. 5 election on promises to put America first. On January 20th, as one of my many first Executive Orders, I will sign all necessary documents to charge Mexico and Canada a 25 Tariff on ALL products coming into the United States, and its ridiculous Open Borders, he said in a post on Truth Social. While migrant arrests reached a record during President Joe Bidens presidency, straining U.S. border enforcement, illegal crossings fell dramatically this year as Biden instituted new border restrictions and Mexico stepped up enforcement. More than 83 of exports from Mexico went to the U.S. in 2023 and 75 of Canadian exports go to the country. The tariffs also potentially spell trouble for overseas companies like the many Asian auto and electronics manufacturers that use Mexico as a low-cost production gateway for the U.S. market. Trumps threatened new tariff would appear to violate the terms of the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement on trade. The deal which Trump signed into law took effect in 2020, and continued the largely duty-free trade between the three countries. Canada and the United States at one point imposed sanctions on each others products during the rancorous talks that eventually led to USMCA. Trump will have the opportunity to renegotiate the agreement in 2026, when a sunset provision will force either a withdrawal or talks on changes to the pact. After issuing his tariff threat, Trump held a conversation with Canadas Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in which they discussed trade and border security, a Canadian source familiar with the situation said. It was a good discussion and they will stay in touch, the source said. Trump could be counting on the threat of tariffs to prompt an early renegotiation of USMCA, said William Reinsch, a former president of the National Foreign Trade Council. This strikes me more as a threat than anything else, Reinsch said. I guess the idea is if you keep hitting them in the face, eventually theyll surrender. Mexicos lower house leader Ricardo Monreal, a member of the ruling Morena party, urged the use of bilateral, institutional mechanisms to combat human, drug and arms trafficking. Escalating trade retaliation would only hurt the peoples pocketbooks and is far from solving underlying problems, he said in a post on social media platform X. Trumps announcement sparked a dollar rally. It rose 1 against the Canadian dollar and 2 against the Mexican peso , while share markets in Asia fell, as did European equity futures . SP 500 futures fell 0.3. On China, the president-elect accused Beijing of not taking strong enough action to stop the flow of illicit drugs crossing the border into the U.S. from Mexico. Until such time as they stop, we will be charging China an additional 10 Tariff, above any additional Tariffs, on all of their many products coming into the United States of America, Trump said. A Chinese embassy spokesperson in Washington hit back. China believes that China-U.S. economic and trade cooperation is mutually beneficial in nature. No one will win a trade war or a tariff war, Liu Pengyu said. The embassy also cited steps it said China had taken since a 2023 U.S.-China meeting after which Beijing agreed it would stem the export of items related to the production of the opioid fentanyl, a leading cause of drug overdoses in the United States. All these prove that the idea of China knowingly allowing fentanyl precursors to flow into the United States runs completely counter to facts and reality, the spokesperson said. Trump has previously pledged to end Chinas most-favored-nation trading status and slap tariffs on Chinese imports in excess of 60 - much higher than those imposed during his first term. The Chinese economy is now in a much more vulnerable position given the countrys prolonged property downturn, debt risks and weak domestic demand. In the run-up to the Nov. 5 election, Trump floated plans for blanket tariffs of 10 to 20 on virtually all imports. He also said he would put tariffs as high as 200 on every car coming across the U.S.-Mexico border. He also voiced his intent to formally invoke the USMCAs six-year review provision upon taking office. Currently, it is expected in July 2026. Mexicos finance ministry said of Trumps tariff pledge: Mexico is the United States top trade partner, and the USMCA provides a framework of certainty for national and international investors. Economists say that Trumps overall tariff plans, likely his most consequential economic policy, would push U.S. import duty rates back up to 1930s-era levels, stoke inflation, collapse U.S.-China trade, draw retaliation and drastically reorder supply chains. They say tariffs are paid by the companies that import the products subject to the duties, and they either pass on the costs to consumers or accept lower profits. Trump frequently refers to countries paying as a consequence of his tariff plan, saying on Monday that Mexico and Canada will pay a very big price. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "date": "November 26, 2024 03:25 pm",
        "content": "India has taken strict action against substandard food imports, rejecting consignments of items like apples, nuts, alcoholic beverages, and sushi from countries including China, Japan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, and Turkey. These products failed to meet the quality and safety standards set by the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI). The FSSAI, Indias top food regulator, has made the details public through its recently launched Food Import Rejection Alert (FIRA) portal. This platform helps authorities worldwide quickly share information about rejected food items, enabling swift action to prevent risks and ensure traceability and transparency. Under Regulation 11(7) of the Food Safety and Standards (Import) Regulation, 2017, the FSSAI is empowered to issue food alert notifications. For instance, a cinnamon flower bud shipment from Sri Lanka was rejected in May because it required prior approval under the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006. Similarly, Sri Lankan areca nuts were turned away in April due to visible mold and other defects. Japan also faced scrutiny when tea bags labeled as health supplements were rejected in June because the ingredient Rooibos is not approved in India. Fresh red apples from Turkey were declined in July due to their short shelf life, while Budweisers non-alcoholic beer (Green Apple) from China was rejected in May for having an unacceptable pH level. Chinese sushi nori (seaweed) was blocked for containing heavy metals and arsenic. Every food product submitted for import clearance in India must pass a rigorous three-tier verification process, including document checks, visual inspections, and laboratory testing. Products are often rejected for reasons such as safety risks (e.g., pesticides, heavy metals), quality concerns (e.g., moisture, fat content), improper labeling, or incomplete documentation. FSSAIs measures reflect its commitment to protecting public health and ensuring only high-quality food products enter the Indian market. Source: India Today --Agencies",

        "date": "November 26, 2024 05:31 pm",
        "content": "Sri Lanka has announced the official launch of the exchange of its outstanding International Sovereign Bonds (ISBs) totaling approximately USD 12.55 billion, as of 25 November 2024. This follows the approval of the terms and conditions of the Invitation by the new Cabinet of Ministers of Sri Lanka, which was formed on 18 November 2024, Sri Lankas Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development said in a statement today. The Finance Ministry stated that the holders of the existing Bonds are invited to tender their Bonds and exchange them for new instruments over a three-week period, with the final deadline set for 12 December 2024. Furthermore, the statement highlighted that Sri Lanka strongly encourages all holders to participate in the exchange process as early as possible. The features of the new instruments have been meticulously discussed for over two years with holders in good faith, ensuring the best possible outcome for all parties. An agreement in principle was reached on 19 September 2024 with two representative groups of holders - one comprising international investors and the other domestic financial institutions - together holding over 50 of the outstanding Bonds, it added. Additionally, the IMF and Sri Lankas Official Creditor Committee have both confirmed that the proposed features of the new instruments are compatible with the parameters of Sri Lankas IMF-supported program and the Comparability of Treatment principle respectively, said the Ministry of Finance. The successful completion of this bond exchange will enable Sri Lanka to achieve sovereign debt sustainability and accelerate the countrys economic recovery. Under the baseline scenario, Sri Lanka will achieve approximately USD 9.5 billion debt service payments reduction over the 4-year IMF program period, 31 reduction in the coupon rate of Sri Lankas Bonds to 4.4, and extension of the average maturity profile of over 5 years. The successful completion of the bond exchange will also normalize relations with bondholders, the ministry expressed. The President and Minister of Finance, Planning and Economic Development, Anura Kumara Dissanayake, said: Todays official announcement of the commencement of the International Sovereign Bond restructuring with private creditors marks an important milestone for Sri Lanka. We extend our gratitude to our external creditors, the IMF and the Official Creditor Committee for the good faith negotiations that have enabled us to reach this point. With the successful achievement of Staff-Level Agreement on the third review of our IMF-supported program last 22 November, I urge private sector creditors to participate in the debt restructuring process to provide essential relief, thereby laying the groundwork for a brighter future for Sri Lanka and its people, he added.",

        "date": "November 26, 2024 05:43 pm",
        "content": "The Steering Committee of the Ad Hoc Group of Sri Lanka Bondholders has announced its support for the restructuring terms of all 11 series of Sri Lankas c.12.55 billion in outstanding sovereign bonds, as detailed in Sri Lankas Exchange Offer and Consent Solicitation Memorandum published today. The Ad Hoc Group represents a diverse and significant cross-section of international holders of Sri Lankas sovereign bonds, collectively holding approximately 40 of Sri Lankas total outstanding sovereign bonds. The Steering Committee of the Ad Hoc Group includes, among others, funds andor accounts managed or advised by Amundi Asset Management, Barings LLC, BlackRock and its subsidiaries, Eaton Vance Management, Fidelity International, Grantham, Mayo, Van Otterloo  Co. LLC, HBK Capital Management, Morgan Stanley Investment Management, Neuberger Berman, T. Rowe Price Associates, Inc., and Wellington Management. The Ad Hoc Group is advised by White  Case LLP as its legal counsel, and Rothschild  Co. as financial advisor. In the two and a half years following Sri Lankas default in 2022, the Ad Hoc Group has engaged in constructive dialogue with the Sri Lankan authorities to define the terms of a bond restructuring aimed at returning the country to the path of debt sustainability and ensuring fair and balanced treatment of bondholders, the statement said. The Ad Hoc Group said it has also cooperated with the Local Consortium of Sri Lanka (LCSL), which is understood to consist of 11 members and controls approximately 12 of Sri Lankas outstanding sovereign bonds, to seek a comprehensive and joint solution for Sri Lanka. Together, the Ad Hoc Group and the LCSL members represent over 50 of the total outstanding amount of Sri Lankas sovereign bonds. This dialogue led to the Agreement in Principle on the core terms of the sovereign bond restructuring announced on September 19, 2024, reached with both the Ad Hoc Group and the LCSL. The IMF has subsequently confirmed that the terms are consistent with the debt targets and other key parameters of Sri Lankas IMF-supported program, and Sri Lankas Official Creditor Committee confirmed that the terms meet the comparability of treatment principle, it said. Early in the negotiations, the Steering Committee introduced two new instruments  Macro-Linked Bonds (MLBs) and Governance-Linked Bonds (GLBs)  whose payouts are linked, respectively, to the economic performance of Sri Lanka during the IMF program period and the achievement by Sri Lanka of certain concrete governance objectives. The Steering Committee is pleased that these innovative instruments have been included as key pillars of the restructuring solution reflected in the Invitation. It further said that since the announcement of the AIP, the Steering Committee and its advisors have worked collaboratively with the Sri Lankan government and its advisory team to refine the terms of the new securities to be offered to bondholders as part of the Invitation, whilst maintaining close cooperation with the LCSL. The Steering Committee strongly supports the terms of the bond restructuring outlined in todays Invitation, which reflect the key legal and financial terms outlined in the AIP. Members of the Steering Committee confirm their intention to participate in the Invitation by tendering their outstanding bonds and providing their consents. They believe that the successful completion of the transactions contemplated by the Invitation and the debt relief provided under the restructuring terms will make a substantial contribution to ensuring the sustainability of Sri Lankas external debt in the medium term, paving the way for the country to achieve strong, sustainable, and inclusive economic growth, the Ad Hoc Group of Sri Lanka Bondholders said. The Steering Committee of the Ad Hoc Group of Bondholders encouraged all holders of Sri Lankas international bonds to review the documentation published by Sri Lanka today, note the respective instructions and deadlines embedded in the Invitation, and participate in the exchange as early as possible.",

        "title": "Sri Lankas new President needs to address longstanding abuses, impunity  Human Rights Watch",
        "date": "November 26, 2024 05:57 pm",
        "content": "Sri Lankas new president, Anura Kumara Dissanayake, should address the countrys many human rights problems by fulfilling and building upon pledges he made in recent election campaigns, Human Rights Watch has said in a letter to the president. Human Rights Watch said in a statement that in his election manifesto, Dissanayake pledged to repeal the Prevention of Terrorism Act, remove abusive provisions of the Online Safety Act, establish an independent Directorate of Public Prosecutions separate from the attorney generals office, aggressively combat corruption, and revise economic policies to promote equity. However, while his government has announced renewed investigations into the 2019 Easter Sunday bombings and other emblematic crimes, it should also reverse the failures of previous administrations to address severe human rights violations committed during the 1983-2009 civil war between the government and the separatist Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, it added. President Dissanayake faces a daunting list of human rights problems, including enduring discrimination against minority communities, which has long divided the country, said Meenakshi Ganguly, deputy Asia director at Human Rights Watch. To live up to its commitments for reform, the new administration should prioritize addressing the entrenched impunity surrounding decades of grave violations, corruption and financial mismanagement, and abusive security force practices severely restricting the rights of Tamils and Muslims. Furthermore, the statement highlighted: Sri Lankas economic crisis has had a disastrous impact on millions of people, eroding public services essential to their rights and placing the burden of efforts to quickly raise revenues on those least able to cope. In March 2023, then-President Ranil Wickremesinghe negotiated a US3 billion bailout with the International Monetary Fund focused on raising government revenues while tackling corruption and improving social protection. However, it shifted the burden of recovery principally onto people with low incomes, while social protection provision is inadequate and new anticorruption legislation has not yet been widely applied. The Dissanayake government has pledged to implement more progressive tax policies; increase government provision to uphold Sri Lankans economic and social rights, such as to health care, education, and social security; and clamp down on corruption. Meanwhile, Human Rights Watch noted that previous governments have pledged to end human rights violations and address past crimes, but they have failed to act, instead pursuing repressive policies while shielding those responsible for past violations and denying justice to victims. It further alleged that successive administrations have harassed and intimidated thousands of families of victims of enforced disappearance, while human rights defenders and journalists have been subject to intrusive government surveillance, threats, and restrictions. President Dissanayake should act on the evidence on enforced disappearances collected by previous commissions of inquiry, reform or replace the Office of Missing Persons, and ensure instead a body that has the trust of victims families and the technical capacity to identify remains discovered in mass graves, Human Rights Watch said. The statement also added: The new government should also immediately impose a full moratorium on the use of the Prevention of Terrorism Act and release remaining prisoners who were convicted on the basis of confessions obtained under torture. It should ensure fair and thorough investigations of grave crimes, including the 2019 Easter Sunday bombings, as well as emblematic cases that were partially investigated between 2015-19 before those investigations were dropped under then-President Gotabaya Rajapaksa. To put an end to the repression of civil society groups, the Dissanayake administration should place the National Secretariat for Non-Governmental Organizations under a ministry responsible for supporting social welfare activities, instead of treating independent groups as security risks. It should also direct the police, military, and intelligence agencies to end the intimidation and arbitrary surveillance of human rights defenders and civil society activists, the statement added. To protect minority rights, the new government should direct state agencies to end the practice of encroaching upon or denying access to minority religious sites, such as Hindu temples, Human Rights Watch said. It should also adopt reforms to the Muslim Marriage and Divorce Act approved by a previous cabinet in 2021. It should repeal laws that are used to criminalize same-sex relationships and to target transgender people, and back a longstanding demand by the womens rights movement to legalize abortion in the country. President Dissanayake and his new government have an opportunity to deliver long-sought-after reforms to governance, Ganguly said. Dissanayake should follow through and build upon his rights commitments to set a new course for human rights in Sri Lanka.",

        "date": "November 26, 2024 06:24 pm",
        "content": "The Local Consortium of Sri Lanka (LCSL), comprised of domestic commercial banks and financial institutions, has committed its full support for the Exchange Offer and Consent Solicitation launched today by the Government of Sri Lanka to restructure the US12.55bn in outstanding International Sovereign Bonds (ISBs) including terms tailored for local holders. This follows the agreement-in-principle reached in September 2024 with the Government on key financial terms. All members of the LCSL intend to participate in the ISB restructuring, which will provide the Government with substantial debt relief. This will be in addition to the support provided to the Government and wider economy since the foreign currency default in April 2022, the LCSL statement said. The restructuring of the ISBs will also cure the sovereign debt default, support the restoration of macroeconomic stability and ensure debt sustainability in the context of the Sri Lanka IMF programme, it said. The Steering Committees of the LCSL and the Ad Hoc Group of Sri Lanka Bondholders (representing international holders of Sri Lankas ISBs) cooperated in order to find a comprehensive solution for Sri Lanka. Members of the LCSL and Ad Hoc Group collectively represent more than 50 of Sri Lankas total outstanding ISBs. The Local Option gives ISB holders the ability to exchange existing claims into new instruments denominated in both Sri Lanka Rupee and US Dollars. The statement further said: Members of the LCSL would like to extend their gratitude to the authorities and all those involved for their efforts in reaching this significant milestone. Curing the default on Sri Lankas ISBs will both facilitate the restoration of external market access and is a crucial step forward not only for the Government but also for LCSL members in maintaining their ability to finance the countrys economic recovery. Sanath Manatunge, Chairman of the LCSL and CEO of Commercial Bank of Ceylon PLC, said: We are pleased to have reached this critical turning point following more than two years of discussions. This restructuring will help restore macroeconomic stability and encourage investment in the local economy to the benefit of the people of Sri Lanka. Members of the LCSL fully appreciate and recognise their responsibility to finance the economic recovery and look forward to fulfilling this role. The LCSL is being advised by Newstate Partners LLP and Baker  McKenzie Wong  Leow. The LCSL is comprised of eleven local banks and financial institutions and holds approximately 12 of the outstanding ISBs. Members include Commercial Bank of Ceylon PLC, DFCC Bank PLC, Hatton National Bank PLC, National Development Bank PLC, Nations Trust Bank PLC, Pan Asia Banking Corporation PLC, Seylan Bank PLC, LOLC Finance PLC, LOLC Financial Sector Holdings (Private) Limited, Softlogic Life Insurance PLC.",

        "date": "November 26, 2024 06:50 pm",
        "content": "Indias coast guard said Tuesday they had seized their biggest haul of illicit drugs when they stopped a fishing boat smuggling 5.5 tonnes of methamphetamine from war-torn Myanmar. An Indian Coast Guard (ICG) reconnaissance air patrol spotted a small fishing boat in the Andaman Sea  which lies between India and troubled Myanmar  operating in a suspicious manner. A coastguard vessel was sent out, with officers boarding at dawn Sunday when the fishing boat with a crew of six Myanmar citizens entered Indian territorial waters, the coastguard statement added. The boarding party found approximately 5,500 kilograms of prohibited drug methamphetamine, it read. The seizure is the biggest-ever drug haul by ICG, highlighting its commitment to safeguarding Indian territorial waters. The boat has since been taken to an Indian naval base. Myanmar has been in turmoil since the military deposed Aung San Suu Kyis elected government in 2021 and launched a crackdown that sparked an armed uprising. Myanmars Shan state is a leading source of synthetic drugs, much of it produced in illegal laboratories hidden in rugged jungle regions controlled by armed groups near Thailands border. Drug producers have increasingly turned to smuggling by boats to avoid tighter patrols on land routes through China and Thailand. A record 190 tonnes of methamphetamine were seized in East and Southeast Asia in 2023, according to the UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC). The seizure made by India could have been sold for millions of dollars on the street. However, UN experts say mass manufacturing means the wholesale price of methamphetamine is as low as 400 per kilogram in production areas. Source: AFP --Agencies",

        "date": "November 26, 2024 10:08 pm",
        "content": "The Monetary Policy Board of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) has decided to implement a single policy interest rate mechanism, the Overnight Policy Rate (OPR), transitioning from its dual policy interest rate mechanism with effect from today (27 November). This has been introduced as announced in the Central Banks Annual Policy Statement in January 2024 and the subsequent announcement in September 2024 of the planned implementation of the single policy interest rate mechanism. This marks another significant improvement in the Flexible Inflation Targeting (FIT) framework implemented by the Central Bank, the central bank said. The statement further said: Accordingly, the Central Bank introduces the Overnight Policy Rate (OPR), as its primary monetary policy tool to signal and operationalise its monetary policy stance. The OPR will be periodically reviewed and adjusted as needed by the Central Bank to indicate and communicate a change in its monetary policy stance. This transition is expected to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of monetary policy signalling and transmission to the financial markets and the broader economy. With this change, the Central Bank will target to maintain the average weighted call money rate (AWCMR), the rate at which banks transact with each other in the interbank market, at or around the announced OPR. AWCMR will remain the operating target of the Central Bank under its FIT framework. The standing facilities, namely the Standing Deposit Facility and the Standing Lending Facility will continue to be available to participatory institutions for overnight transactions with the Central Bank. The applicable rates for these facilities, namely the Standing Deposit Facility Rate (SDFR) and the Standing Lending Facility Rate (SLFR) will be linked to the OPR, with pre-determined margins as decided by the Central Bank. SDFR and SLFR will continue to provide the lower bound and upper bound, respectively, for interbank call money rates. With this transition to the single policy interest rate mechanism, SDFR and SLFR will no longer be considered policy interest rates of the Central Bank. The Central Banks monetary policy is guided by the FIT framework, which aims to maintain headline inflation at the target rate of 5 per cent, while fostering economic growth to reach its potential.",

She stated that the agreements reached by the Sri Lankan authorities with both the Steering Committee of the Ad Hoc Group of external bondholders, and the Local Consortium of Sri Lanka, mark a significant step forward and that the terms of these agreements have been assessed by the IMF staff as being in line with the parameters of the IMF-supported program. Anchored by policies under the IMF-supported program, the successful implementation of these agreements will provide significant external debt service relief and further contribute to Sri Lankas efforts to restore debt sustainability, the IMF chief said. To capitalize on this momentum, rapid completion of the debt operation with high creditor participation would be vital for the success of the program. In parallel, the authorities continue to finalize other remaining debt restructuring agreements, she said, adding that this collective effort is key to supporting the success of Sri Lankas debt restructuring efforts.

She reiterated that the IMF remains a steadfast partner in supporting Sri Lanka and its people and stands ready to assist the country achieve its economic and social reform goals. Kristalina Georgieva, Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), issued the following statement about Sri Lanka to Members of the Financial Community today: The Sri Lankan authorities have been implementing an ambitious economic reform program supported by the IMF, which aims to restore debt sustainability and external viability, underpin broad macroeconomic reforms, and strengthen economic governance and transparency. Sri Lankas economic reform program is supported by an SDR 2.286 billion (about US3 billion), 48-month Extended Fund Facility arrangement, approved by the IMFs Executive Board on March 20, 2023. The program has gotten off to a good start with the economy recovering, inflation remaining low, and reserves being accumulated. Following the completion of two reviews, IMF staff reached staff level agreement with the authorities on November 23 for the third review under the arrangement. In June 2024, Sri Lanka agreed on a memorandum of understanding with the Official Creditors Committee (OCC) and reached final agreement with China EXIM Bank that would deliver a debt treatment by those creditors aimed at restoring debt sustainability consistent with IMF program parameters. Building on this progress, and following several months of constructive discussions, the agreements reached by the Sri Lankan authorities with both the Steering Committee of the Ad Hoc Group of external bondholders, and the Local Consortium of Sri Lanka, mark a significant step forward. The terms of these agreements have been assessed by the Fund staff as being in line with the parameters of the IMF-supported program.

        "date": "November 27, 2024 08:34 am",
        "content": "The Monetary Policy Board of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) has decided to further ease the monetary policy stance and set the newly introduced Overnight Policy Rate (OPR) at 8.00 per cent. With this change, the effective reduction in the policy interest rate would be around 50 basis points from the current level of the Average Weighted Call Money Rate (AWCMR), which continues to serve as the operating target of the Flexible Inflation Targeting ( FIT) framework, the central bank said. The Board arrived at the decision, at its meeting held on 26 November 2024, to ease the monetary policy stance following a comprehensive assessment of current and expected domestic and international economic developments, including risks and uncertainties, to ensure that inflation treads towards the inflation target of 5 per cent, while supporting the economy to reach its full capacity, it said. In particular, with the latest available incoming data, the critical factors that convinced the Board to further ease monetary policy were the deeper-than-expected deflation conditions in the near term with further moderation of underlying inflationary pressures and inflation expectations, better-than-expected developments on the external front, and the lack of further space available for a reduction in market lending rates. Effective 27 November 2024, the Central Bank also moved to a single policy interest rate mechanism from its dual policy interest rate mechanism. Accordingly, the Overnight Policy Rate (OPR), set at 8.00 per cent, will serve as the primary monetary policy tool of the Central Bank to signal and operationalise its monetary policy stance henceforth. Moreover, with this transition to the single policy interest rate mechanism, the Standing Deposit Facility Rate (SDFR) and the Standing Lending Facility Rate (SLFR) will no longer be considered policy interest rates of the Central Bank. SDFR and SLFR, the rates applicable for standing facilities that will continue to be available for participatory institutions for overnight transactions with the Central Bank, are linked to the OPR with a margin of  50 basis points. Accordingly, SDFR and SLFR will be 7.50 per cent and 8.50 per cent, respectively.",

        "title": "Israel and Lebanons Hezbollah start a ceasefire after nearly 14 months of fighting",
        "date": "November 27, 2024 09:22 am",
        "content": "The ceasefire between Israel and Lebanons Hezbollah militants began early Wednesday as a region on edge wondered whether it will hold. The ceasefire announced Tuesday is a major step toward ending nearly 14 months of fighting sparked by the ongoing war in Gaza between Israel and Hamas. There were no immediate reports of alleged violations of the truce, and there were signs of celebration in Beirut. But Israel has said it will attack if Hezbollah breaks the agreement. The ceasefire calls for an initial two-month halt to fighting and requires Hezbollah to end its armed presence in southern Lebanon, while Israeli troops are to return to their side of the border. Thousands of additional Lebanese troopsand U.N. peacekeepers would deploy in the south, and an international panel headed by the United States would monitor compliance. An Israeli military spokesman, in an Arabic-language X post in the first half-hour of the ceasefire, warned evacuated residents of southern Lebanon to not head home yet, saying the military remained deployed there. The ceasefire began at 4 a.m. Wednesday, a day after Israel carried out its most intense wave of airstrikes in Beirut since the start of the conflict that in recent weeks turned into all-out war. At least 42 people were killed in strikes across the country, according to local authorities. The ceasefire does not address the devastating war in Gaza, where Hamas is still holding dozens of hostages and the conflict is more intractable. There appeared to be lingering disagreement over whether Israel would have the right to strike Hezbollah if it believed the militants had violated the agreement, something Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu insisted was part of the deal but which Lebanese and Hezbollah officials have rejected. Israels security Cabinet approved the U.S.-France-brokered ceasefire agreement after Netanyahu presented it, his office said. U.S. President Joe Biden, speaking in Washington, called the agreement good news and said his administration would make a renewed push for a ceasefire in Gaza. The Biden administration spent much of this year trying to broker a ceasefire and hostage release in Gaza but the talks repeatedly sputtered to a halt. President-elect Donald Trump has vowed to bring peace to the Middle East without saying how. Netanyahu presented the ceasefire proposal to Cabinet ministers after a televised address in which he listed accomplishments against Israels enemies across the region. He said a ceasefire with Hezbollah would further isolate Hamas in Gaza and allow Israel to focus on its main enemy, Iran. If Hezbollah breaks the agreement and tries to rearm, we will attack, he said. For every violation, we will attack with might. Biden said Israel reserved the right to quickly resume operations in Lebanon if Hezbollah breaks the terms of the truce, but that the deal was designed to be a permanent cessation of hostilities. Netanyahus office said Israel appreciated the U.S. efforts in securing the deal but reserves the right to act against every threat to its security. Lebanons caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati welcomed the ceasefire and described it as a crucial step toward stability and the return of displaced people. Hezbollah has said it accepts the proposal, but a senior official with the group said Tuesday it had not seen the agreement in its final form. After reviewing the agreement signed by the enemy government, we will see if there is a match between what we stated and what was agreed upon by the Lebanese officials, Mahmoud Qamati, deputy chair of Hezbollahs political council, told the Al Jazeera news network. We want an end to the aggression, of course, but not at the expense of the sovereignty of the state, he said, referring to Israels demand for freedom of action. Any violation of sovereignty is refused. Even as ceasefire efforts gained momentum in recent days, Israel continued to strike what it called Hezbollah targets across Lebanon while the militants fired rockets, missiles and drones across the border. An Israeli strike on Tuesday leveled a residential building in central Beirut  the second time in recent days warplanes have hit the crowded area near downtown. At least seven people were killed and 37 wounded, according to Lebanons Health Ministry. Israel also struck a building in Beiruts bustling commercial district of Hamra for the first time, hitting a site around 400 meters (yards) from Lebanons Central Bank. There were no reports of casualties. The Israeli military said it struck targets linked to Hezbollahs financial arm. The evacuation warnings covered many areas, including parts of Beirut that previously were not targeted. Residents fled. Traffic was gridlocked, with mattresses tied to some cars. Dozens of people, some wearing pajamas, gathered in a central square, huddling under blankets or standing around fires as Israeli drones buzzed overhead. Israeli military spokesman Avichay Adraee issued evacuation warnings for 20 buildings in Beiruts southern suburbs, where Hezbollah has a major presence, as well as a warning for the southern town of Naqoura where the U.N. peacekeeping mission, UNIFIL, is headquartered. UNIFIL spokesperson Andrea Tenenti said peacekeepers will not evacuate. The Israeli military also said its ground troops clashed with Hezbollah forces and destroyed rocket launchers in the Slouqi area on the eastern end of the Litani River, a few kilometers (miles) from the Israeli border. Under the ceasefire deal, Hezbollah is required to move its forces north of the Litani, which in some places is about 30 kilometers (20 miles) north of the border. Hezbollah began firing into northern Israel on Oct. 8, 2023, saying it was showing support for the Palestinians, a day after Hamas carried out its attack on southern Israel, triggering the Gaza war. Israel returned fire on Hezbollah, and the two sides have exchanged barrages ever since. Israel escalated its bombardment in mid-September and later sent troops into Lebanon, vowing to put an end to Hezbollah fire so tens of thousands of evacuated Israelis could return to their homes. More than 3,760 people have been killed by Israeli fire in Lebanon the past 13 months, many of them civilians, according to Lebanese health officials. The bombardment has driven 1.2 million people from their homes. Israel says it has killed more than 2,000 Hezbollah members. Hezbollah fire has forced some 50,000 Israelis to evacuate in the countrys north, and its rockets have reached as far south in Israel as Tel Aviv. At least 75 people have been killed, more than half of them civilians. More than 50 Israeli soldiers have died in the ground offensive in Lebanon. Source: AP --Agencies",

        "title": "Bolsonaro was directly involved in 2022 coup plot, Brazils police say",
        "date": "November 27, 2024 12:28 pm",
        "content": "Brazils federal police presented evidence to the Supreme Court that former President Jair Bolsonaro was directly involved in plotting a coup to overturn the outcome of the 2022 election he lost, according to an 884-page report unsealed on Tuesday. That final police report, the result of a nearly two-year investigation, lays out evidence gathered from search warrants, wiretaps, financial records and plea bargain testimony pointing to a criminal conspiracy with Bolsonaro at the helm. Bolsonaro effectively planned, directed and executed, in coordination with other officials since at least 2019, concrete acts that aimed at the abolition of the democratic rule of law, with him remaining as president, the report said. Police also found that Bolsonaro had full knowledge of a plan to assassinate Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, then president-elect, and his running mate, based on dialogue captured between conspirators and meetings at the presidential residence. The report cites eight main pieces of evidence to back up the formal accusation against Bolsonaro in the alleged coup attempt, including a meeting he called in December 2022 with top commanders of the armed forces, presenting them with a proposed coup détat and asking them to join the conspiracy. The army and air force commanders refused, according to police, while the navy commander, now retired Admiral Almir Garnier Santos, expressed support, according to investigators. Garnier Santos was one of the 37 people, most retired and some active duty military officers, including Bolsonaro whom police formally accused last week of a role in the planned coup. The countrys prosecutor general, Paulo Gonet, will now decide whether to press charges against Bolsonaro and his alleged co-conspirators. Bolsonaro, who was formally accused for the attempted coup, violent abolition of the democratic rule of law and criminal organization, has denied committing any crime. On Monday, he told journalists in Brasilia that he had never discussed a coup. His lawyer did not immediately respond to request for comments on the full report on Tuesday. A representative for Garnier did not immediately respond to request for comment. Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes on Tuesday lifted the seal on the police report regarding the alleged coup plot. Lula Targeted Bolsonaros Defense Minister, now retired General Walter Braga Netto, also played an important role in planning the alleged coup, the police investigation found. Not only did he encourage Bolsonaros allies to attack the armed forces commanders on social media for not joining the coup plot, he held a meeting at his house where the assassination of Lula and his Vice President-elect Geraldo Alckmin was discussed and approved, the report said. Braga Netto, who was Bolsonaros running mate in the 2022 election, has denied this. It was never a coup, much less a plan to murder someone, he said in a social media post following last week official accusation. Bolsonaro never recognized his defeat by Lula, who was sworn in as president on Jan. 1, 2023. The formal police accusations against Bolsonaro are a fresh blow to his plan to run for president in 2026. U.S. President-elect Donald Trumps recent victory had buoyed Bolsonaro allies trying to overturn a court decision that has blocked him from public office for attacking the legitimacy of the 2022 vote. Federal police finished two separate criminal probes of Bolsonaro and his associates earlier this year formally accusing them of tampering with COVID-19 vaccination cards while in office and of embezzling jewelry gifted by the Saudi government. Reuters reported last week, citing sources, that Gonet is planning to merge the three investigations into Bolsonaros actions against Brazils democratic system and produce one single global indictment against him. Because of that, Brazils top public prosecutor is not likely to issue any indictments until next year for Bolsonaro, members of his government and military officers who allegedly planned the coup, they said.

        "date": "November 27, 2024 04:40 pm",
        "content": "OpenAI first teased its text-to-video AI model, Sora, back in February and hasnt provided any meaningful updates on when it will be released since then. Now, it looks like some artists leaked access to the model in protest of being used by the company for what they claim is unpaid RD and PR. On Tuesday, a group of Sora beta testers claimed to have leaked early access to Sora with a working interface for generating videos. In a post on Hugging Face, a public repository of AI models, they say that people were able to create lots of AI videos  all of which resemble OpenAIs own Sora demos  before the company intervened to shut down access. (TechCrunch first reported on the alleged leak.) The authors say that OpenAIs early access program to Sora exploits artists for free labor and art washing, or lending artistic credibility to a corporate product. They criticize the company, which recently raised billions of dollars at a 150 billion valuation, for having hundreds of artists provide unpaid testing and feedback. They also object to OpenAIs content approval requirements for Sora, which apparently state that every output needs to be approved by the OpenAI team before sharing. When contacted by The Verge, OpenAI would not confirm on the record if the alleged Sora leak was authentic or not. Instead, the company stressed that participation in its research preview is voluntary, with no obligation to provide feedback or use the tool. Sora is still in research preview, and were working to balance creativity with robust safety measures for broader use, OpenAI spokesperson Niko Felix said in a statement. Hundreds of artists in our alpha have shaped Soras development, helping prioritize new features and safeguards. Participation is voluntary, with no obligation to provide feedback or use the tool. Weve been excited to offer these artists free access and will continue supporting them through grants, events, and other programs. We believe AI can be a powerful creative tool and are committed to making Sora both useful and safe. Former OpenAI CTO Mira Murati told The Wall Street Journal in March that Sora would be available by the end of the year but that, we will not release anything we dont feel confident on when it comes to how it might affect global elections or other issues. And in a recent Reddit AMA, CPO Kevin Weil said Sora hadnt been released yet because OpenAI still needed to scale the compute required to power it and get safetyimpersonationother things right.

        "title": "South Korean stars baby scandal sparks national debate",
        "date": "November 27, 2024 06:55 pm",
        "content": "A South Korean actors revelation that he fathered a child with a woman to whom he is not married has triggered a national debate over celebrity conduct and non-traditional family structures. Jung Woo-sung, a 51-year-old A-lister in South Koreas film industry, confirmed via his agency on Sunday that he is the father of 35-year-old model Moon Ga-bis newborn son. While Jung pledged to fulfil his responsibilities as the father, his silence on whether he plans to marry Moon drew fierce backlash in the conservative country where births outside marriage are seen as taboo. But some progressive voices have defended Jung, noting a shift in South Koreas attitudes towards diverse family structures. Moon announced her childs birth via Instagram on Friday, without mentioning the father, describing the pregnancy as unexpected and saying she had been completely unprepared for the sudden news. Two days later, Jungs agency Artist Company released a statement confirming that the baby Moon revealed on her social media is Jung Woo-sungs son. The statement further noted that Jung and Moon were discussing the best way to raise the child. It triggered outrage that quickly spread across the country, triggering a slate of opinion pieces in tabloids, spurring online debate and eliciting comments from national politicians. Online, the response was largely critical towards Jung, whose prolific film career has made him a household name in South Korea. Many commentators seemed to believe the actor had tarnished an otherwise upstanding and squeaky clean image, with some expressing disappointment that the former United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees ambassador cant accept his own child. Jung Woo-sung is pretending to be a good guy saying he will fulfil all his duty A child does not grow on money alone, wrote one commenter on Naver News, South Koreas largest news aggregate website. Its not a problem not marrying after having a child. Its that he pretended to be such an ethical person so far, wrote another. Speaking to conservative news outlet JoongAng, an unnamed lawmaker from the right-wing People Power Party described Jungs decision to have a child outside marriage as something unthinkable in this country of social mores. No matter how much the times are changing, Koreas tradition and public sentiment must be kept (righteous), the lawmaker said. A recent social survey by South Koreas statistics agency found that 37 of people believed it was acceptable to have a child outside marriage - an almost 15 increase since 2012. Of those who said marriage was necessary, more than 72 were above the age of 60 - with younger respondents increasingly less likely to take that view. Other lawmakers have defended Jung, with Lee So-young, a member of the Democratic Party of Korea, saying that deciding to live with someone is a deeply personal and existential choice. To assume that simply having a child obligates people to marry and take on the duties of cohabitation and mutual support feels suffocating, Lee wrote on Facebook on Tuesday. Of course, theres nothing wrong with being normal But even if society appears to have a standard of normal, every life is unique in its own way. Perhaps a better society is one that accepts and respects such differences without judgment, she added. Thats what I believe. Kyunghyang, a progressive major newspaper, put out an editorial piece noting that while some voices have pushed for traditional values, also rising is the voice that our society must think of the diverse shapes families take. It makes one hope that celebrities having babies outside of marriage, like Jung and Moon, will help change the public view which today is against such births. South Korea has a notoriously high-pressure entertainment industry, with celebrities often held to inordinately high social standards and placed under extreme scrutiny. Source: BBC --Agencies",

        "date": "November 28, 2024 09:35 am",
        "content": "Sri Lankas Ministry of Foreign Affairs has expressed its support for the recently announced ceasefire between Israel and Lebanon. In an official statement, the Ministry emphasized its optimism, stating, We remain hopeful that the ceasefire will pave the way for enduring peace and stability in Lebanon and in the region. The ceasefire announced Tuesday (26) is a major step toward ending nearly 14 months of fighting sparked by the ongoing war in Gaza between Israel and Hamas. There were no immediate reports of alleged violations of the truce, and there were signs of celebration in Beirut. But Israel has said it will attack if Hezbollah breaks the agreement. The ceasefire calls for an initial two-month halt to fighting and requires Hezbollah to end its armed presence in southern Lebanon, while Israeli troops are to return to their side of the border. Thousands of additional Lebanese troops and U.N. peacekeepers would deploy in the south, and an international panel headed by the United States would monitor compliance. An Israeli military spokesman, in an Arabic-language X post in the first half-hour of the ceasefire, warned evacuated residents of southern Lebanon to not head home yet, saying the military remained deployed there. The ceasefire began at 4 a.m. Wednesday, a day after Israel carried out its most intense wave of airstrikes in Beirut since the start of the conflict that in recent weeks turned into all-out war. At least 42 people were killed in strikes across the country, according to local authorities. The ceasefire does not address the devastating war in Gaza, where Hamas is still holding dozens of hostages and the conflict is more intractable. Lebanons caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati welcomed the ceasefire and described it as a crucial step toward stability and the return of displaced people. Hezbollah has said it accepts the proposal, but a senior official with the group said Tuesday it had not seen the agreement in its final form. After reviewing the agreement signed by the enemy government, we will see if there is a match between what we stated and what was agreed upon by the Lebanese officials, Mahmoud Qamati, deputy chair of Hezbollahs political council, told the Al Jazeera news network. We want an end to the aggression, of course, but not at the expense of the sovereignty of the state, he said, referring to Israels demand for freedom of action. Any violation of sovereignty is refused. Under the ceasefire deal, Hezbollah is required to move its forces north of the Litani, which in some places is about 30 kilometers (20 miles) north of the border. Hezbollah began firing into northern Israel on Oct. 8, 2023, saying it was showing support for the Palestinians, a day after Hamas carried out its attack on southern Israel, triggering the Gaza war. Israel returned fire on Hezbollah, and the two sides have exchanged barrages ever since. --Agencies",

        "content": "Both houses of Indian parliament were suspended temporarily on Thursday within minutes of opening as opposition lawmakers disrupted proceedings for the third day this week seeking a discussion on allegations against the Adani Group. U.S. authorities have accused Gautam Adani, his nephew Sagar Adani and managing director of Adani Green, Vneet S. Jaain, of being part of a scheme to pay bribes of 265 million to secure Indian solar power supply contracts, and misleading U.S. investors during fund raises there. We want a discussion on this in parliament. It is going to be the third day that we are demanding a reply from the prime minister on the Adani issue, Manickam Tagore, a lawmaker from the main opposition Congress party, which has been leading the protests against the business group, told news agency ANI. Many of Indias opposition parties accuse Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) of favouring Adani and blocking investigations against him in India, accusations both have denied. Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, who has been a vocal critic of Adani, said Gautam Adani, 62, should be arrested. While the government has not made any comment on the indictment, Modis BJP has said it had no reason to defend Adani, adding that the party was not against industrialists and considered them partners in nation-building efforts. Let him defend himself, BJP spokesperson Gopal Krishna Agarwal said on Tuesday, adding that the law would take its course. Source: Reuters --Agencies",

        "date": "November 28, 2024 02:11 pm",
        "content": "Sean Diddy Combs will remain in jail after a judge rejected his latest attempt for release while the rapper and music producer awaits trial on charges of sex trafficking and racketeering conspiracy. Judge Arun Subramanian denied Combs teams motion for release on Wednesday. His decision followed a two-hour court hearing on Friday where he appeared to explore potential options and questioned prosecutors allegation that Combs continued to obstruct the ongoing investigation. The Court finds that the government has shown by clear and convincing evidence that no condition or combination of conditions will reasonably assure the safety of the community, the judge wrote in a five-page order. CNN has reached out to representatives for Combs for comment. Federal prosecutors argued that Combs could not be trusted on bail because he flouted the rules of the jail and judge. They said he posed a danger to women and was tampering with witnesses  even while in federal custody at the Metropolitan Detention Center. Prosecutors allege Combs tried to evade law enforcement monitoring by using several techniques, including three-way calling, to contact witnesses. They also accused him of violating the judges own order limiting communications and ignored his lawyers guidance in part by orchestrating a social media campaign around his birthday to try to influence the potential jury pool. The judge pointed to evidence that Combs was not following the jail rules  including the continued use of a messaging service  in his decision. Underscoring the Courts concern, despite defense counsels assurances to the Court at the November 22, 2024 hearing (with Combs in attendance) that Combs stopped using ContactMeASAP as of November 16, 2024,  the government indicates that Combs has continued to use this service as recently as this past Sunday, November 24, 2024. His attorneys have relentlessly pursued his release from federal custody, arguing that private security would provide more restrictions on Combs than federal jail. They said Combs needed to be free to help prepare his defense against the criminal charges and roughly 30 civil lawsuit alleging sexual abuse. His attorneys identified a three-bedroom apartment on Manhattans Upper East Side where they argued he would be surrounded by security 247 to monitor visits and phone calls. Under their proposed bail package, Combs would also post a 50 million bond. During Fridays hearing the judge scoffed at the suggestion that Combs could stay at his home in Miami with a boat dock, saying thats not going to work. The hip-hop mogul was arrested in September and charged with sex trafficking, racketeering conspiracy, and prostitution-related charges. He has pleaded not guilty and will go to trial on May 5. Combs was previously denied bail by two other federal judges who found there were no conditions that would assure them that he wouldnt try to obstruct the investigation or be a threat to the community. Combs initially appealed one of those rulings and then asked the appeals court to put that on hold while tried again with Judge Subramanian, who was transferred the case. Source: CNN --Agencies",

After a parliamentary session that went into the night, the countrys Senate, or upper house of parliament, voted to pass the law after the centre-left Labor government of Prime Minister Anthony Albanese won support from the conservative opposition. The Senates approval for the law is the final legislative hurdle after the lower house, or House of Representatives, passed the bill on Wednesday.
